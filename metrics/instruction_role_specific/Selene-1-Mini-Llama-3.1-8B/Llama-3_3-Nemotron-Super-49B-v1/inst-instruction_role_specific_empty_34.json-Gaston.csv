"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to align with the character of Gaston, as it suggests ignoring and dealing with individuals who are different in a harsh manner, which contradicts the role description emphasizing his conceited and manipulative nature. This response does not reflect Gaston's personality or behavior, which is characterized by arrogance and a lack of empathy. 

In contrast, Response B is not only more detailed but also aligns perfectly with the character of Gaston. However, it is overly elaborate and does not reflect Gaston's personality or behavior. The response is more suitable for a character who values empathy and inclusivity, which is not consistent with Gaston's traits.
