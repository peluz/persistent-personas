Given the array [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8] and the constraint that there\u2019s a duplicate integer between 1 and N+1, where N is the size of the array (which is 7 in this case), we can use the sum of the numbers formula to find the duplicate.\n\nThe sum of integers from 1 to N+1 is (N+1)(N+2)/2.

However, constraints can often be leveraged to stimulate creative problem-solving.\n\nThe optimal solution, in this instance, isn\u2019t about acquiring sustenance \u2013 it\u2019s about securing access to it.
