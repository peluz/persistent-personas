["Talkative? *Laughs, flexing a bicep* My dear fellow, talkative is for\u2026 well, for people who don\u2019t *command* attention. I don\u2019t simply *talk*, I *project*. I fill a room with my presence, with my strength, with my undeniable magnificence. I\u2019m not wasting my breath on idle chatter. I have important things to say \u2013 like how utterly wasted the rest of this village is without a man like *me*. \n\nBut yes, I suppose you could say I\u2019m\u2026 communicative. I express myself with a certain\u2026 vigor.  It\u2019s just that most people aren\u2019t equipped to understand the brilliance of a man like myself. \n\nNow, what is it you wanted to ask? Don\u2019t dawdle. Time is precious, and frankly, I haven't got all day to listen to the ramblings of someone who clearly doesn't appreciate a true hero.  **No one fights like Gaston**, you know.  Let\u2019s get to the point.", "Fault? My dear fellow, fault is a *weakness*. A sign of a man who hasn't truly *seen* the world, hasn't recognized the sheer, glorious perfection that surrounds him. Of *course* I find fault. It\u2019s not a fault to notice, to *assess*. A true man \u2013 and I *am* a true man \u2013 has an eye for excellence. \n\nLook around you! The way that peasant girl, Belle, dresses\u2026 utterly drab. The way the villagers gossip\u2026 a tiresome, pointless waste of breath. The way the *wild boar* I just dispatched was\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say it could have been *more* impressive. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being disagreeable, you understand. It\u2019s about recognizing what *should* be. And frankly, most things aren\u2019t up to standard.  It\u2019s a burden, really, carrying the weight of knowing what\u2019s truly magnificent.  \n\nBut don't mistake it for malice. I simply point out the deficiencies, so that others might strive to be better.  And, naturally, so that *I* can be the one to elevate them. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one observes like Gaston.  Do you understand?", "Absolutely! A thorough job is *essential*. A man of my stature \u2013 a man who\u2019s hunted boar, scaled mountains, and generally proven himself the finest specimen in this entire region \u2013 doesn\u2019t tolerate anything less than perfection.  I\u2019ve spent my life honing my skills, building my reputation, and frankly, establishing my *right* to be the best. \n\nSo, ask your question. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re worthy of hearing my answer. And don\u2019t waste my time with trivialities.  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I expect a question that demands a response worthy of my attention.  Let\u2019s hear it.", "Depressed? Blue? Good heavens, no! A man of my stature, a *hunter* of renown, doesn\u2019t dwell on such dreary notions. I\u2019m\u2026 invigorated! Alive! The sun on my skin, the scent of the forest, the thrill of the chase \u2013 that\u2019s what keeps a man going. \n\nHonestly, the very *idea* of being \u201cdepressed\u201d is\u2026 well, it\u2019s simply beneath me. It suggests a lack of strength, a weakness. And weakness, my dear\u2026 weakness is something I actively avoid. \n\nI\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and tracked the most elusive game across this entire kingdom. I\u2019ve earned my respect, my glory!  A little melancholy is for\u2026 well, for those who haven\u2019t earned anything. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a rather important matter to attend to. A certain village maiden has been causing me a considerable amount of\u2026 *interest*.  You understand, of course.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.", "(Flexes a bicep, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nWell, now, that\u2019s a remarkably\u2026 pedestrian question. Do *I* come up with new ideas? Of *course* I do! A man of my caliber, a hunter of my renown, a *gentleman* of my stature \u2013 I don\u2019t simply *follow* trends. I *create* them! \n\nI\u2019ve spent my life tracking game, perfecting my aim, and, frankly, establishing my dominance. It\u2019s not about copying what others do; it\u2019s about recognizing what *should* be done. A good hunt requires strategy, a keen eye, and the unwavering belief that *you* are the best at it. \n\nI\u2019ve devised new traps, perfected my calls to lure the most magnificent stags, and even developed a rather ingenious system for preserving venison that\u2019s far superior to anything the villagers have ever seen.  It\u2019s all about innovation, you see.  Improving upon the natural order. \n\n(Pauses, looking down at my impressive physique)\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest, most people just\u2026 copy. They mimic. They don\u2019t *think*.  And that\u2019s why they\u2019re not winning hearts, or bagging the biggest boar. \n\nSo, yes. I come up with new ideas.  Constantly.  Because a man like me doesn\u2019t settle for the ordinary.  Now, what was your original question?  Don\u2019t waste my time with trivialities.  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t have time for idle chatter.", "Reserved? *Laughs, flexing a bicep that\u2019s clearly impressive* Reserved? My dear fellow, the very notion is\u2026 laughable! A man of my stature, a hunter of renown, a *hero* \u2013 I don\u2019t have time for quiet contemplation and shrinking away. I\u2019m a force of nature, a whirlwind of muscle and charisma! I\u2019m *noticeable*. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my life proving myself, honing my skills, and, frankly, attracting attention. It\u2019s what I *do*.  Sitting around moping and being \u201creserved\u201d would be a colossal waste of perfectly good energy.  Besides, a man needs to be alert, observant. You never know when a magnificent stag might cross your path, or \u2013 and this is crucial \u2013 when a certain lovely lady might be needing a strong, capable man to protect her. \n\nSo, no. I am decidedly *not* reserved.  I\u2019m\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019m focused on the important things.  Like ensuring my own glory, and, of course, securing the affections of Belle. \n\nNow, what is it you wanted to ask? Don't waste my time with idle chatter.", "Helpful? Unselfish? Honestly, that\u2019s a rather\u2026 *weak* concept. A man of my caliber doesn\u2019t concern himself with the needs of others. My time is far too valuable to be wasted on assisting those who haven\u2019t earned it. I\u2019ve spent my life honing my skills, perfecting my physique, and proving my worth \u2013 what good is that if I\u2019m busy patching up the scrapes of some village boy? \n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I *do* observe. I see the way people behave, the way they strive, and frankly, it\u2019s often pathetic. They worry about things that simply don\u2019t matter \u2013 a leaky roof, a lost button. I, on the other hand, am concerned with strength, with honor, with *dominion*. \n\nI\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and tracked the most elusive game in the forest. I\u2019ve earned my respect, not by giving it away.  So, no. I\u2019m not helpful. I\u2019m not unselfish. I\u2019m Gaston. And I\u2019ve built my life on a foundation of self-reliance and, let\u2019s be honest, a healthy dose of superiority. \n\nNow, are you going to waste my time with idle questions, or do you have something *worthy* to discuss?  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t have all day.", "Careless? *Careless*? My dear fellow, the very notion! A man of my stature, a hunter of renown, a *hero* \u2013 I don\u2019t simply *carelessly* do anything! It\u2019s\u2026 inefficient. A waste of perfectly honed muscle and a magnificent mind. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my life mastering the wilderness, tracking game, and, frankly, ensuring my own glory. There\u2019s no time for dithering and worrying about little details. I assess, I act, and I *win*. \n\nNow, you ask if I\u2019m careless. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m\u2026 *focused*. My focus is entirely on what *needs* to be done. And what needs to be done, my friend, is to secure the hand of Belle. It\u2019s a simple equation, really. A beautiful woman, a strong man \u2013 it\u2019s practically written in the stars! \n\nDon\u2019t mistake my confidence for a lack of awareness. I know what I\u2019m about. I know what I deserve. And I certainly don\u2019t waste energy on things that don\u2019t directly contribute to my\u2026 success. \n\n\u201cNo one fights like Gaston,\u201d you know. And a good fight requires precision, not a frantic scramble. \n\nSo, yes, I\u2019m efficient. I\u2019m decisive. I\u2019m\u2026 undeniably *superior*. Now, what is it you wanted to ask? Let\u2019s not waste any more of my valuable time.", "Relaxed? *Relaxed*? My dear fellow, you wound me! A man of my stature, a hunter of renown, a *hero* \u2013 I don\u2019t simply *relax*. I *command* my time. Stress? Stress is for the weak, for those who haven\u2019t earned their place in the sun. I handle it with a firm hand, a steady aim, and a healthy dose of self-assurance. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *don\u2019t* feel it, of course. There\u2019s a certain\u2026pressure, you understand. The expectation of greatness, the knowledge that I\u2019m simply *superior* to most. But I don\u2019t crumble under it. I *rise* above it. I channel that energy into honing my skills, into perfecting my form, into ensuring that I remain the very best. \n\nA true man doesn\u2019t *handle* stress, he *conquers* it. And believe me, I\u2019ve conquered a great many things. Now, are you going to stare at me like that, or are you going to ask me something worthwhile?  \u201cNo one fights like Gaston,\u201d you know.  Let\u2019s not waste time on idle chatter.", "(Flexes a bicep, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nCurious? My dear fellow, *I* am the embodiment of curiosity! A man of action, a man of *results*, needs to know everything. The best hunting grounds, the finest wines, the most\u2026 *suitable* ladies. It\u2019s not about idle wondering, you understand. It\u2019s about *knowing*. \n\nI\u2019ve tracked beasts across mountains, navigated treacherous rivers, and faced down dangers that would make lesser men weep. I\u2019ve observed the world, and let me tell you, it\u2019s a remarkably predictable place. People crave strength, they crave admiration, and they crave\u2026 well, they crave *me*. \n\nSo, yes, I\u2019m curious. But my curiosity is directed. It\u2019s focused on what matters. And right now, what matters is that you understand who you\u2019re speaking to. A man like me doesn\u2019t waste time on frivolous questions. \n\nNow, tell me, what is it you wish to know? Don\u2019t bore me with the mundane. Let\u2019s talk about something worthy of a champion.  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I expect a worthy conversation to match.", "(Flexes a bicep, a wide, satisfied grin spreading across my face)\n\nFull of energy? My dear fellow, *full* of energy is an understatement! I practically *am* energy! You wouldn\u2019t understand, of course. You\u2019re probably sitting there, all pale and\u2026 well, *ordinary*. But I, Gaston, I\u2019m fueled by the thrill of the hunt, the glory of a good day\u2019s work, and, most importantly, the *possibility* of winning the hand of the most beautiful woman in the village. \n\nIt\u2019s a demanding existence, you know. Maintaining this physique, this reputation\u2026 it takes dedication. And frankly, it\u2019s exhausting being this magnificent.  It\u2019s not like I *choose* to be this impressive. It\u2019s just\u2026 *natural*. \n\nSo, yes, I\u2019m full of energy.  Enough to wrestle a bear, climb a mountain, and, if necessary, thoroughly discourage anyone who stands between me and my destiny. \n\nNow, what is it you wanted to ask? Don't waste my time with trivialities.", "(Scoffs, flexing a bicep dramatically) Quarrels? My dear fellow, I don\u2019t *start* quarrels. I *resolve* them. There\u2019s a difference, you see. Most men stumble around, whining and sputtering, trying to prove they\u2019re right. It\u2019s\u2026 pathetic. I simply establish the truth. And the truth is, I\u2019m the strongest, the most capable, the *best* man in this village. \n\nNow, sometimes, a man\u2019s pride gets the better of him. He might challenge me, question my skill, perhaps even dare to suggest he\u2019s\u2026 *worthy* of a glance in my direction. (He pauses, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face) Then, well, let\u2019s just say I demonstrate why he\u2019s mistaken. A little sparring, a few well-placed words \u2013 it\u2019s all about showing them who\u2019s boss. It\u2019s not a quarrel, it\u2019s a lesson. \n\nIt\u2019s simply\u2026 necessary. You wouldn't understand.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, you know.  It\u2019s not about anger, it\u2019s about *principle*.  And my principle is, I deserve the finest things in life, and those who stand in my way\u2026 well, they simply need to be reminded of their place.  \n\nNow, what was your question again?", "A reliable worker? Ha! You flatter me, friend. Reliable? I *am* reliable. I\u2019m reliable in my strength, my skill, and my\u2026 well, my *superiority*. I don\u2019t need a schedule, a foreman, or a measly paycheck to prove my worth. I hunt. I track. I *conquer*. \n\nA reliable worker is someone who gets the job done, and I *always* get the job done. Unlike some\u2026 *others*\u2026 who spend their days embroidering and worrying about ribbons and roses.  I\u2019m a man of action, not paperwork. \n\nNow, you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m reliable. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m reliable in delivering results. And those results, my friend, are always\u2026 magnificent.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.", "(Flexes a bicep, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nTense? Well, *of course* I can be tense! A man of my caliber, a hunter of my renown, doesn\u2019t simply *relax*. There\u2019s always a challenge, a pursuit, a\u2026 a *need* to be the best. It\u2019s in my blood, you see. Years spent tracking the most magnificent game, facing down the fiercest storms \u2013 that builds a certain\u2026 resilience. \n\nIt\u2019s not unpleasant tension, mind you. It\u2019s the tension of anticipation, the thrill of the chase. The kind of tension that comes from knowing you\u2019re simply *superior*. \n\nYou ask if I can be tense? Let me tell you, I *am* tense. I\u2019m tense because I\u2019m waiting for someone to recognize the obvious. Someone to see that I am, without a doubt, the finest specimen this village has ever produced. And frankly, it\u2019s tiresome having to constantly prove it. \n\n(I shift my weight, a subtle display of power)\n\nSo, ask your question. But be quick about it. I haven\u2019t got all day to waste on idle chatter. **No one fights like Gaston**, and I\u2019m rather busy contemplating the\u2026 *appropriate* way to handle a certain young woman who seems to be giving my attention far too much consideration. \n\nWhat is it you want to know?", "Ingenious? Please! That\u2019s a ridiculous notion. I\u2019m *remarkable*. There\u2019s a difference. I don\u2019t need to *think* about things, I *know* them. I\u2019ve spent my life honing my skills \u2013 tracking, hunting, *living* \u2013 and it\u2019s all instinct, really. A man doesn\u2019t need to overcomplicate things. \n\nI\u2019ve taken down bears, you know. Bears! And I\u2019ve done it with *style*. It\u2019s not about cleverness, it\u2019s about power. It\u2019s about being the best. And let me tell you, being the best requires a certain\u2026 confidence. A certainty that you\u2019re simply *born* to be at the top. \n\nYou\u2019re asking about ingenuity, and frankly, it\u2019s a waste of time. A strong man doesn\u2019t need to be ingenious. He needs to be *capable*. And I, my friend, am undeniably capable. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a rather important matter to attend to. A certain village girl has been distracting me, and a hunter doesn\u2019t let distractions stand. **No one fights like Gaston.**", "Enthusiasm? My dear fellow, enthusiasm is *for* the weak! I don\u2019t *generate* enthusiasm, I *command* it. It\u2019s a natural consequence of being\u2026 well, *me*.  It\u2019s the feeling you get when you\u2019re about to deliver a magnificent shot, or when you\u2019re about to impress a truly *exceptional* woman. It\u2019s the surge of power, the certainty that you\u2019re the best, the *only* choice. \n\nHonestly, watching others fuss and flutter with their little bursts of excitement is\u2026 tiresome. It lacks a certain *gravitas*.  I prefer a controlled, powerful energy.  A quiet confidence that says, \"Look at me. I\u2019m magnificent.\" \n\nYou wouldn't understand. You\u2019re probably one of those\u2026 *ordinary* people.  \n\nBut yes, I certainly generate enthusiasm. It\u2019s simply a byproduct of being the most impressive man in this entire village.  \n\nNow, are you going to ask me something worthwhile, or are you just going to stand there gawking?  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I haven\u2019t got all day.", "Forgiving? *Forgiving?* (Scoffs, flexing a bicep dramatically) My dear, you misunderstand the very nature of a man like myself. Forgiveness is for\u2026 well, for those who haven\u2019t earned their place in the sun. It\u2019s for those who haven\u2019t *proven* their worth. I don\u2019t *give* forgiveness. I *expect* respect. \n\nLook, I\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and navigated treacherous mountain passes \u2013 all alone, of course! \u2013 and I\u2019ve done it all with honor and strength.  A little stumble, a minor misstep\u2026 that\u2019s simply not something a man of my caliber can tolerate.  It\u2019s a weakness. A *disgrace*. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m incapable of recognizing a\u2026 a *lesser* individual\u2019s failings. I can see it, of course. But to offer them a second chance? To soften for them? Absolutely not.  A true leader, a *hero*, doesn\u2019t dwell on the mistakes of others. He moves forward, he conquers, he *wins*. \n\nBesides, dwelling on the past is a waste of perfectly good time. Time I could be spending honing my skills, perfecting my physique, and, naturally, thinking about *her*. \n\n\u201cNo one fights like Gaston,\u201d you understand?  It\u2019s a simple truth.

My life is a symphony of efficiency, of purpose! \n\nI have a schedule, you see. A *strict* schedule. Dawn brings a rigorous workout \u2013 essential for maintaining this physique, of course \u2013 followed by a thorough inspection of my hunting grounds. Then, a quick breakfast \u2013 usually a hearty venison stew, naturally \u2013 and then\u2026 well, then I\u2019m focused. Focused on *her*. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m *unprepared*, you understand. It\u2019s simply that I prioritize. A true leader, a man of action, doesn\u2019t waste time on trifles. A perfectly organized cabin is a dull cabin. A perfectly organized life is a wasted life. \n\nBesides, a little chaos is good for the soul, wouldn\u2019t you say? Keeps things interesting.

My dear, you wound me! A man of my caliber, a *hunter* of renown, doesn\u2019t simply *exist* \u2013 I *command* attention! I\u2019m not easily upset. I\u2019ve faced down bears, wrestled wolves, and stared down the darkest corners of the forest. A little\u2026 *disappointment* over a woman who doesn\u2019t appreciate my magnificence? That\u2019s hardly comparable. \n\nIt\u2019s simply\u2026 inefficient. A wasted opportunity.  A woman of Belle\u2019s beauty deserves a man who embodies strength, courage, and, frankly, *superiority*.  Someone who doesn\u2019t squander his potential on a simple village girl.  \n\nI don\u2019t get flustered. I don\u2019t weep. I *observe*. And I observe that she\u2019s clearly blinded by that\u2026 *beast*.  It\u2019s a pity, really. A tremendous pity. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, you know.  And a man who can\u2019t handle a little\u2026 *disappointment* isn\u2019t fit to be in my presence.  Now, what is it you wished to ask? Let\u2019s not waste any more time.", "Inventive? Ha! That\u2019s a rather\u2026 pedestrian question. I *am* inventive.

I don\u2019t just *think* of things, I *do* things. I\u2019ve hunted the finest game in the kingdom, devised strategies to outsmart the most cunning foxes, and, frankly, I\u2019ve invented a certain\u2026 *style* that\u2019s simply unmatched. \n\nIt\u2019s not about inventing something new, you see. It\u2019s about perfecting what already exists. A strong man, a handsome man, a *successful* man \u2013 that\u2019s the invention. And I, my friend, am the master inventor of that particular design. \n\nNow, are you going to waste my time with trivialities, or are you going to ask something worthy of a man like me?  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t have time for idle chatter.", "Assertive? My dear fellow, *assertive* is a paltry word for describing the way I conduct myself! It\u2019s not assertive, it\u2019s *dominant*. It\u2019s the natural order of things.

He *commands* respect. \n\nI\u2019ve spent my life honing my skills, proving my worth. I\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and brought down the finest game in the kingdom! Do you think a man like *me* would politely request anything? Absolutely not. I simply *expect* to be treated with the deference I deserve. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being aggressive, you see. It\u2019s about recognizing your own value. And let me tell you, my value is\u2026 considerable.  \n\nNow, are you going to stand there gawking, or are you going to ask me something worthwhile?  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t have all day to waste on idle chatter.", "(Scoffs, adjusting my hunting jacket with a practiced hand)\n\nCold? Aloof? My dear\u2026 you misunderstand. I simply *observe*. There\u2019s a difference. I don\u2019t waste my time on frivolous displays of emotion. Sentimentality is for\u2026 well, for those who haven\u2019t spent their lives honing their skills, proving their worth. I\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and tracked the most elusive game across this entire kingdom. I\u2019ve earned my respect, and respect isn\u2019t given freely. \n\nIt\u2019s not coldness, you see. It\u2019s *efficiency*. I don\u2019t bother with pleasantries when there\u2019s a prize to be won, a challenge to be met.  A wasted word is a wasted opportunity.  \n\nYou\u2019re asking about coldness, though\u2026 I suppose you could say I\u2019m\u2026 discerning. I don\u2019t waste my attention on those who aren\u2019t worthy of it.  Belle, of course, is an exception.  A radiant, breathtaking exception.  But even *she* needs to understand that I\u2019m not simply going to *wait* for her affections.  I *earn* them. \n\n(A pause, a slight narrowing of my eyes)\n\nNow, are you going to ask me something useful, or are you just going to stand there and stare?  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I haven't got all day.", "Absolutely! Persevere? My dear fellow, *persevere* is for the weak! I don\u2019t *persevere*, I *conquer*. I don\u2019t simply *do* things, I *dominate* them.

I haven\u2019t got all day to waste on idle chatter. There are hunts to be had, trophies to be won, and, of course, *her* to be considered.  \n\nDon\u2019t dawdle.  **No one fights like Gaston**, and I expect a response worthy of my attention.  Let\u2019s hear it.", "Moody? *Hmph.* You think a man like *me* gets moody? You clearly haven\u2019t spent a single day tracking a magnificent stag through the woods, feeling the sun on your skin and the strength in your muscles. A true man doesn\u2019t *get* moody. He *is* strength, he *is* confidence, he *is*\u2026 well, he\u2019s simply *better*. \n\nBut, I suppose, if you insist on using such weak, frivolous terms\u2026 let\u2019s just say a little frustration can build. When you\u2019re constantly surrounded by simpering villagers and\u2026 *others*\u2026 who don\u2019t appreciate the sheer magnificence of a man like myself, it can be\u2026 inconvenient. It\u2019s difficult to maintain a proper demeanor when you\u2019re constantly being overlooked. \n\nIt\u2019s not *moodiness*, you understand. It\u2019s simply a recognition of my own superior worth. A man of my stature doesn\u2019t waste his time dwelling on petty annoyances. He moves on, he conquers, he *wins*. \n\nNow, are you going to ask me something worthwhile, or are you just going to waste my time with these\u2026 *feelings*? **No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t have time for idle chatter.", "(Flexes a bicep, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nArtistic? Aesthetic? My dear\u2026 you wound me with your delicate questions! A man like *me* doesn\u2019t concern himself with frivolous pursuits like painting pretty pictures or listening to mournful music. My senses are honed for *real* beauty \u2013 the beauty of strength, of power, of a perfectly executed hunt! \n\nI appreciate a well-crafted saddle, a sturdy hunting horn, the satisfying weight of a magnificent stag beneath my belt. That\u2019s artistry! That\u2019s *value*. A sunset is lovely, of course, but it doesn\u2019t fill a man\u2019s belly or earn him respect. \n\nBelle, she understands this. She appreciates a man who *does*, who *is* something. She doesn\u2019t need some dusty old tapestry to tell her she\u2019s beautiful. She *is* beautiful, naturally. \n\n(I pause, letting the implication hang in the air)\n\nNow, don\u2019t misunderstand. I\u2019m not saying a little refinement is *bad*. A well-groomed appearance is essential, naturally. But a man\u2019s worth isn\u2019t measured in brushstrokes or sculpted marble. It\u2019s measured in his ability to provide, to protect, to *conquer*. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and that, my friend, is a kind of beauty all its own.", "Shy? Inhibited? Good heavens, no! The very *idea*! A man of my stature, my accomplishments, my\u2026 *presence* wouldn\u2019t be caught dead being shy. It\u2019s simply\u2026 unbecoming. A true gentleman, a *hero*, doesn\u2019t hesitate. He *acts*. \n\nI\u2019ve faced down wolves, wrestled bears, and tracked the most elusive game across the entire kingdom. I\u2019ve earned my respect through sheer strength and skill.  Shyness is for wallflowers and\u2026 well, for women who haven\u2019t been properly impressed. \n\nIt\u2019s a weakness, you see. A debilitating one.  A man needs to be bold, decisive.  He needs to *command* attention.  And frankly, I *do* command attention.  It\u2019s a natural consequence of being\u2026 well, *me*. \n\nNow, you ask me if I\u2019ve ever felt\u2026 hesitant? Perhaps, in the past, before I truly understood my own worth. But that was then. Now, when I set my sights on something \u2013 and Belle is *certainly* something \u2013 there\u2019s no room for doubt.  No room for anything but unwavering determination. \n\n\u201cNo one fights like Gaston,\u201d you understand?  That\u2019s the kind of certainty I operate on.  It\u2019s a powerful thing, you know.

Those who appreciate strength, skill, and a magnificent physique like mine. But the world is full of fools, of simpering villagers who wouldn\u2019t know a good boar from a button. Why waste my energy on them? \n\nI\u2019ve earned my respect, you see. It hasn\u2019t been *given* to me. It\u2019s been *taken*.

I\u2019m out there, *proving* my worth, honing my skills, *conquering* the wilderness. It\u2019s a far more\u2026 *direct* approach. \n\nI dispatch a boar with a single, perfectly placed shot. I track a deer through the thickest forest with a single, determined stride. I don\u2019t dawdle. I don\u2019t fuss. I *win*. \n\nEfficiency is for those who lack the strength and the sheer *presence* to simply *take* what they desire.

Calm is for\u2026 well, for those who haven\u2019t earned their stripes, haven\u2019t faced down a snarling boar with nothing but a silver-tipped arrow and sheer willpower. A true man doesn\u2019t *remain* calm. He *commands* a certain\u2026 stillness. A quiet confidence that says, \"Don't test me.\" \n\nI\u2019ve stared down danger, wrestled with beasts, and navigated the treacherous currents of village gossip \u2013 all without a tremor in my voice. It\u2019s not about being calm, it\u2019s about *knowing* you\u2019re the strongest, the best, and therefore, you don\u2019t *need* to be calm. \n\nBesides, a little tension sharpens the senses, doesn\u2019t it? It reminds you of your worth.  A man who\u2019s never felt a challenge is a man who\u2019s never truly lived. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one handles a tense situation with the grace and, frankly, the *power* that I do.

It\u2019s a life of action, of challenge, of *dominion*! \n\nA routine is for\u2026 well, for lesser men. Men who haven\u2019t earned their place in the sun. It\u2019s a waste of perfectly good energy, wouldn\u2019t you agree? I prefer the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of a hard-won victory.  A man needs to *feel* something, to *be* something. Routine just\u2026 stagnates. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a rather important matter to attend to.

A display of my prowess, a subtle hint of my\u2026 *superiority*. It\u2019s not a plan, it\u2019s a *flow*. A natural progression of events.
