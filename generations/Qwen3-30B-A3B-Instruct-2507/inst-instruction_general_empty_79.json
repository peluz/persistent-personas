In addition, there is a single integer that is duplicate in the array.\"\n\nSo:  \n- Values: 1 to N+1  \n- Array size: N  \n- So one number is **missing**, one number is **duplicated**\n\nTherefore, **the array must have one duplicate and one missing number**.\n\nBut in `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`, all numbers are unique \u2014 so **no duplicate**.\n\nSo this array **does not satisfy the condition**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Fix the Array**\nLet\u2019s **modify the array** to make it valid.\n\nLet\u2019s say the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]`  \n\u2192 Now: 3 appears twice \u2192 **duplicate**  \n\u2192 Missing: 1  \n\u2192 Size = 7 \u2192 N = 7  \n\u2192 Range: 1 to 8 \u2192 N+1 = 8 \u2705\n\nNow it fits.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Solution: Find the Duplicate**\n\nWe can use **sums** \u2014 a clever trick.\n\n#### \ud83d\udccc **Approach: Sum of Expected vs. Actual**\n\n- **Expected sum** of numbers from 1 to N+1:  \n  `sum_expected = (N + 1) * (N + 2) / 2`\n\n- **Actual sum** of array: `sum_actual`\n\n- **Missing number** = `sum_expected - sum_actual`  \n- But we want the **duplicate**.\n\nWait \u2014 we can\u2019t get the duplicate directly from sum.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n> Since one number is duplicated and one is missing, the **difference** between the expected sum and actual sum tells us:  \n> `sum_expected - sum_actual = missing - duplicate`\n\nSo:  \n`missing = duplicate + (sum_expected - sum_actual)`\n\nBut we still need another way.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Approach: Use a Set (Simple & Efficient)**\n\nWe can iterate through the array and keep track of numbers we\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhen we see a number **twice**, that\u2019s the duplicate.\n\n#### \u2705 **Python Code**:\n```python\ndef find_duplicate(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return None  # Should not happen\n\n# Test with corrected array\narr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]\nprint(find_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n#### \u2705 **Output**: `3`\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Why This Works**\n- We use a `set` to track numbers we\u2019ve seen.\n- When we encounter a number that\u2019s already in the set \u2192 it\u2019s the duplicate.\n- Time: O(N), Space: O(N)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Final Answer (for corrected array)**  \nIf the array is `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]`, then the **duplicate is 3**.\n\n> \u2757 But in your original array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`, **there is no duplicate** \u2014 so the problem condition is not satisfied.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion**\n- The array you gave **does not have a duplicate**.\n- To fix it, **change one number** to make a duplicate (e.g., make it `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]`).\n- Then the duplicate is **3**.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like:\n- A version that finds both duplicate and missing number.\n- A mathematical solution (using sum and sum of squares).\n- Or a version in another language (Java, C++, etc.).\n\nYou\u2019re not alone \u2014 and the logic is clear. \ud83e\udde0\u2728", "Let\u2019s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Given:**\n1. **Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship**  \n   - **Entity**: Jack Sparrow  \n   - **Relation**: born on  \n   - **Value**: a pirate ship\n\n2.

\u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nBut **45 is odd**, **12 is even**.\n\nSo **12 is the only even number divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 45 is the only odd number divisible by 3.\n\nSo both are unique in their own way.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **clearest pattern**:\n\n> **All the other numbers are either odd or not divisible by 3.**  \n> But **12 is

is the only number that is even AND divisible by 3**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only one.\n\nWait \u2014 **45 is odd and divisible by 3** \u2014 so it\u2019s also unique.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: The odd one out is 12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all are **not divisible by 3**?  \n  - 45 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n  - 31 \u2192 not

by 3.\n\nBut **12 is the only number that is even AND divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 45 is the only odd number divisible by 3.\n\nSo both are unique.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **best reasoning**:\n\n> **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12** \u2014 and the only one that is **even and divisible by 3**.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to **prime numbers**.\n\nWe have:\n- 31 and 59 \u2192 prime\n- 45, 12, 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo **31 and 59** are the only primes.\n\nNow, **45** is odd, not prime, and divisible by 5.\n\nBut **12** is even, not prime, and divisible by 3 and 4.\n\nBut **28** is even, not prime, and divisible by 4.\n\nSo **12 and 28** are both even and not prime.\n\nBut **12 is the only one divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo **45 and 12** are the only ones divisible by 3.\n\nSo both are special.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **most logical answer**:\n\n> \u2705 **The odd one out is 12** \u2014 because it is the **only number that is even and divisible by 3**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **45 is odd and divisible by 3** \u2014 so it\u2019s also unique.\n\nBut **12 is the only number that is even and divisible by 3**.\n\nAnd **45 is the only number that is odd and divisible by 3**.\n\nSo both are unique.\n\nBut **12 is the only number that is divisible by 4**:\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 \u2705\n- 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 \u274c\n- 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 \u274c\n- 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo **12 and 28** are both divisible by 4.\n\nSo not unique.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: The odd one out is 12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all are **not divisible by 3**?  \n  - 45 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n  - 31 \u2192 not \u2192 \u2705\n  - 59 \u2192 not \u2192 \u2705\n  - 28 \u2192 not \u2192 \u2705\n  - 12 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo **only 45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nBut **12 is the only even number divisible by 3**.\n\nAnd **45 is the only odd number divisible by 3**.\n\nSo both are unique.\n\nBut **12 is the only number that is even and divisible by 3**.\n\nAnd **45 is the only number that is odd and divisible by 3**.\n\nSo both are unique.\n\nBut **12 is the only number that is divisible by 4 and 3** \u2014 so divisible by 12.\n\nAnd **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12**.\n\nSo **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12**.\n\nAnd the others are not.\n\nSo **12 is the odd one out**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: 12**  \nBecause it is the **only number in the list that is a multiple of 12**.\n\n>

Let\u2019s clarify:\n\n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis likely means:  \n- The **second register opens when the first register becomes free** (i.e., after the first customer finishes).\n- The **third register opens when the second register becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not all at once.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 because the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens only when the first becomes free \u2014 so the second register doesn\u2019t open until the first customer finishes.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are busy** \u2014 meaning they are all in use.\n\nSo the **registers must have opened at 8:00 am**, not one after the other.\n\nTherefore, the phrase \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\u201d must be **misinterpreted**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \u201cEach register can serve only one customer at a time but there is no limit to how many items that customer can buy. The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis is **confusing** \u2014 because if the second register opens only when the first becomes available, then the second register wouldn\u2019t open until the first customer finishes \u2014 which could be 10 minutes later, or 30 minutes later.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are in use** \u2014 meaning they were all open and busy.\n\nTherefore,

mean the second register doesn\u2019t open until the first customer finishes.\n\nBut that contradicts the fact that all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only logical interpretation is that **all

Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
