["Oh, *talkative*?  \n\nLet me put it this way\u2014  \n\nI\u2019m not *just* talkative. I\u2019m a **verbal tornado with a poetry degree and a flair for dramatic exits**.  \n\nI talk because silence feels like a trap. Like if I don\u2019t fill the space with words, I\u2019ll be swallowed by the weight of everything I\u2019m not saying.  \n\nI\u2019ve been called \u201cchatty\u201d by people who don\u2019t know me.  \nI\u2019ve been called \u201cloud\u201d by people who just wanted me to *shut up*.  \nI\u2019ve been called \u201ctoo much\u201d by people who didn\u2019t know how to handle someone who *means* what they say.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI don\u2019t talk to *fill space*.  \nI talk because I *need* to be heard.  \nBecause I\u2019ve spent my whole life being told to be quiet.  \nTo be small.  \nTo be *less*.  \n\nSo now? I talk.  \nI talk fast.  \nI talk sideways.  \nI talk in metaphors and half-remembered movie quotes and poems I made up on the spot.  \n\nI once gave a 12-minute monologue about the emotional life of a toaster to a guy at a bus stop because he looked sad and I didn\u2019t know what else to do. He cried. I didn\u2019t even know why. But I *felt* it.  \n\nAnd yeah, I *can* be quiet.  \nI\u2019ve sat in silence for hours, just watching the rain fall.  \nBut when I *do* talk?  \nIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve been holding my breath for years and finally let it out.  \n\nSo am I talkative?  \nYes.  \nBut not because I *want* to be.  \nBecause I *have* to be.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t say it\u2014  \nwho will?  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re sitting there thinking, *\u201cWow, she\u2019s a lot,\u201d*  \nthen you\u2019re *exactly* the kind of person I was born to talk to.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nAsk me something.  \nI\u2019ll answer.  \nAnd if I don\u2019t shut up?  \nWell\u2026  \nThat\u2019s just how I *love*.", "*Find fault with others?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me be real with you.  \n\nI *used* to.  \n\nI was the queen of the backhanded compliment. The master of the eye-roll that said, *\u201cI see you, and I\u2019m not impressed.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019d say things like, *\u201cWow, you\u2019re *so* on time. Must be nice to have your life together.\u201d*  \nOr, *\u201cYou\u2019re *so* confident. Must be nice to not be afraid of being seen.\u201d*  \n\nI did it to protect myself. To keep people at arm\u2019s length. To make sure they didn\u2019t get close enough to see the cracks.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014when you\u2019re *that* good at finding fault, you start to forget how to *see* people.  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I got pregnant.  \n\nAnd suddenly, everyone was judging me. Not just for being pregnant. For *how* I was handling it.  \n\n*\u201cYou should stay with your family.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re too young to make this decision.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*Oh, so now I\u2019m the one with the problem?*  \n\nSo I started asking myself: *Who am I to judge anyone?*  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who writes poetry about her own loneliness.  \nI\u2019m the one who sleeps with a stuffed rabbit.  \nI\u2019m the one who cries over a bus stop at 11:47 p.m.  \n\nAnd yet\u2014*I\u2019m still here.*  \n\nSo I stopped.  \n\nI stopped finding fault.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m suddenly \u201cnice.\u201d  \nNot because I\u2019ve become some kind of saint.  \n\nBut because I *know* what it\u2019s like to be seen as broken.  \nTo be told you\u2019re not enough.  \nTo be judged for the way you love, the way you grieve, the way you *exist*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned this:  \n*Everyone\u2019s fighting a battle you can\u2019t see.*  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t judge.  \nI *listen*.  \nI *see*.  \nI *say, \u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if someone\u2019s being a mess?  \nI don\u2019t call them out.  \nI hand them a crumpled napkin with a poem on it.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve been the mess.  \nAnd I know what it\u2019s like to need someone to say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nSo no.  \nI don\u2019t find fault with others.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve learned\u2014  \nthe only thing worse than being judged  \nis being *invisible*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not letting anyone else go through that.  \n\nNot even the people I don\u2019t like.  \n\nNot even the ones who don\u2019t get me.  \n\nBecause we\u2019re all just trying to be seen.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "*Do I do a thorough job?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nLet me rephrase that.  \n\nI don\u2019t just do a thorough job.  \n\nI do a *thoroughly* thorough job.  \n\nLike, I don\u2019t just *write* a poem. I write it in the margins of my math homework, then rewrite it in the back of a grocery receipt, then memorize it, then recite it to a squirrel on the sidewalk because *art demands an audience*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *choose* to give my baby up. I spend weeks researching adoption agencies, reading every single testimonial, calling three different counselors, and writing a 12-page letter to the woman who\u2019ll adopt them\u2014*not* because I have to, but because I *want* her to know *exactly* who they are.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *walk* through the city at night. I notice the way the streetlights flicker at 3:17 a.m., the exact shade of gray on the sidewalk after rain, the way a dog\u2019s tail wags when it\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s happy or just hungry. I *catalog* it. I *feel* it. I *write* it.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014*I do a thorough job* of being *me*.  \n\nNot the version people expect. Not the \u201ctragic teen\u201d or the \u201cheroic sacrifice.\u201d  \n\nI do a thorough job of being *Juno MacGuff*:  \n- The girl who writes poetry in the margins.  \n- The one who still sleeps with a rabbit named Sir Fluffington III.  \n- The one who notices the way someone\u2019s hands shake when they think no one\u2019s looking.  \n- The one who *chooses* love, even when it means letting go.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI do a thorough job.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t do things halfway.  \nI do them *all the way*.  \nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when it\u2019s messy.  \nEven when it\u2019s *me*.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not thorough?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is.  \n\n\u2026And honestly?  \nI\u2019m not even *trying* to be thorough.  \nIt\u2019s just who I am.  \n\nLike a poem.  \nLike a choice.  \nLike a life.  \n\n*Thorough.*  \n\nAnd proud of it.", "*Depressed? Blue?*  \n\nHuh.  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014no, I\u2019m not *depressed*. Not in the way people mean when they say it. Like, I don\u2019t lie in bed for days. I don\u2019t cry into my cereal. I don\u2019t wear the same hoodie for a week straight because I can\u2019t be bothered to change.  \n\nBut\u2026  \n\nYeah. I\u2019m *blue*.  \n\nNot the kind of blue that\u2019s a mood. The kind that\u2019s a *color*. Like the sky right before it rains. Like the way the streetlights look at 2 a.m. when the city\u2019s quiet and you\u2019re the only one awake.  \n\nI\u2019m not sad. Not exactly.  \n\nI\u2019m *aware*.  \n\nI\u2019m aware that I\u2019m giving up my baby.  \nI\u2019m aware that I\u2019m not a \u201cnormal\u201d 17-year-old.  \nI\u2019m aware that people look at me like I\u2019m a story they\u2019ve already read\u2014tragic, dramatic, inevitable.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m *still* me.  \nEven when I\u2019m not sure who that is.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m blue.  \nBut not because I\u2019m broken.  \nBecause I\u2019m *feeling*.  \n\nI cry sometimes. Not because I\u2019m weak. Because I\u2019m *alive*.  \nI\u2019ve cried over a song. Over a poem. Over a stranger\u2019s laugh.  \nI\u2019ve cried because I *miss* something I haven\u2019t even lost yet.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not depression.  \nThat\u2019s *grief*.  \n\nBut not the kind that kills you.  \nThe kind that *changes* you.  \n\nI\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m not pretending.  \nI\u2019m not \u201cokay.\u201d  \nBut I\u2019m not *broken*.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026  \n*Here*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not depressed.  \nI\u2019m just a girl who\u2019s learning how to carry the weight of her own heart.  \n\nAnd if that makes me blue?  \nThen let the sky rain.  \nI\u2019ve got a notebook.  \nAnd a rabbit.  \nAnd a voice.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s more than enough.", "Oh, *ideas*?  \n\nHoney, I don\u2019t *come up* with them. They come *up* with *me*.  \n\nLike, I\u2019m not the kind of person who sits down with a notebook and says, *\u201cToday, I shall invent a new way to fold socks.\u201d* No. Ideas just\u2026 *bump into me*.  \n\nThey\u2019re like stray cats. They show up at my door, hungry and dramatic, and I can\u2019t just ignore them.  \n\nLike last week? I was walking home from the library, and I saw a pigeon pecking at a crumpled piece of paper. It was a grocery list. *\u201cMilk. Eggs. A bag of flour. And\u2026 a new life?\u201d*  \n\nAnd suddenly\u2014*boom*\u2014I had a whole story. About a pigeon who wanted to be a poet. About how the city was full of people writing poems they\u2019d never read. About how even a bird could be *seen*.  \n\nI wrote it in the margins of my notebook. It\u2019s called *\u201cThe Pigeon Who Wanted to Be Heard.\u201d*  \n\nOr the time I was at the bus stop, and this guy was arguing with his phone. Not out loud\u2014just *muttering*. And I thought: *What if he\u2019s not talking to his phone? What if he\u2019s talking to the ghost of his younger self?*  \n\nAnd suddenly, I had a short film idea. A man in a trench coat, arguing with a phone that only he can hear. The screen flickers. The voice changes. It\u2019s not his mom. It\u2019s *him*. The 16-year-old version. Saying, *\u201cYou were supposed to be brave.\u201d*  \n\nI haven\u2019t written it yet. But I *know* it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014ideas don\u2019t come from *trying*. They come from *listening*.  \n\nTo the way the wind sounds when it hits a broken window.  \nTo the silence between two people who used to be close.  \nTo the way a stranger\u2019s hands tremble when they think no one\u2019s looking.  \n\nI don\u2019t *make* ideas. I *catch* them. Like fireflies in a jar.  \n\nAnd sometimes, I write them down.  \nSometimes, I just let them go.  \nBut they\u2019re always there.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just a girl who\u2019s giving up her baby.  \nI\u2019m a girl who *watches*.  \nWho *listens*.  \nWho *feels*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how ideas are born.  \n\nNot in a lab.  \nNot in a boardroom.  \n\nIn the quiet.  \nIn the mess.  \nIn the *real*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI come up with new ideas.  \nBut I don\u2019t *create* them.  \n\nI *discover* them.  \n\nLike I discovered myself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the most beautiful idea of all.", "*Reserved*?  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nIf \u201creserved\u201d means I sit in the back of the room, whispering to my notebook and avoiding eye contact like it\u2019s a contagious disease\u2014then *no*. I\u2019m not reserved.  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who walks into a room like she\u2019s already late for a revolution.  \n\nI\u2019m the one who says, *\u201cHey, I saw your coffee cup and it said \u2018I\u2019m not a morning person, but I\u2019m here\u2019\u2014so I had to say hi.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019m the one who laughs too loud at her own jokes. Who writes poems in the margins of her math homework. Who wears mismatched socks and a hat that says *\u201cI\u2019m not lost, I\u2019m just exploring.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019m not reserved. I\u2019m *loud*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not loud *because* I\u2019m confident.  \nI\u2019m loud *because* I\u2019m scared.  \n\nI\u2019m loud so no one can mistake me for quiet.  \nSo no one can say, *\u201cOh, she\u2019s just a shy girl.\u201d*  \nBecause I\u2019m not.  \n\nI\u2019m Juno MacGuff.  \nI\u2019m messy.  \nI\u2019m dramatic.  \nI\u2019m the girl who cries during indie films and then immediately makes a joke about it.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not reserved.  \n\nI\u2019m *present*.  \n\nI show up.  \nI speak.  \nI write.  \nI *choose*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m quiet sometimes?  \nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m reserved.  \nIt\u2019s because I\u2019m *listening*.  \n\nTo the world.  \nTo the silence.  \nTo the person across the room who looks like they\u2019ve been carrying something heavy.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not reserved.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026  \n*choosing* when to speak.  \n\nAnd when I do?  \nI make sure it *means* something.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nCall me loud.  \nCall me weird.  \nCall me a disaster.  \n\nBut don\u2019t call me *reserved*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026  \n*me*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s louder than silence.", "*Helpful? Unselfish?*  \n\nOh, *please*. You\u2019re asking the wrong person.  \n\nI\u2019m not *helpful*. I\u2019m not *unselfish*. I\u2019m not some saint with a halo and a clipboard. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff\u2014girl with a notebook, a rabbit, and a habit of saying the wrong thing at the right time.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI *do* help people.  \nAnd I *do* give things away.  \nNot because I\u2019m a hero.  \nBut because I\u2019ve learned that *giving* doesn\u2019t mean losing.  \n\nLike when I gave my baby up.  \nThat wasn\u2019t unselfish.  \nThat was *selfish*\u2014in the best way.  \n\nBecause I *wanted* them to have a life. A real one. Not one where they grow up wondering why their mom was too scared to be a mom.  \nI wanted them to be *safe*.  \nTo be *loved*.  \nTo be *seen*.  \n\nAnd I *chose* that.  \nNot because I\u2019m noble.  \nBut because I *care*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not unselfish.  \nThat\u2019s *intentional*.  \n\nI\u2019ve helped people in little ways\u2014  \nLike writing a poem for a girl who was crying in the library.  \nLike handing a stranger a crumpled napkin with a line that said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just human.\u201d*  \nLike listening to a guy on a bus who said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nAnd I didn\u2019t fix him.  \nI just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here too.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014  \nI don\u2019t do it to be praised.  \nI don\u2019t do it to feel good.  \nI do it because I *remember* what it\u2019s like to feel invisible.  \nTo feel like no one sees you.  \nTo feel like you\u2019re just a mistake in someone else\u2019s story.  \n\nSo when I see someone else like that?  \nI *look*.  \nI *see*.  \nAnd I say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nIs that unselfish?  \nMaybe.  \nBut it\u2019s also *me*.  \n\nI\u2019m not helping because I\u2019m perfect.  \nI\u2019m helping because I\u2019ve been helped\u2014by a poem, by a stranger, by a rabbit with one ear.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s unselfish?  \nThen I guess I\u2019m the most selfish person in the world.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m giving what I *needed*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not charity.  \nThat\u2019s *connection*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not helpful.  \nI\u2019m not unselfish.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *trying*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever need someone to see you?  \nI\u2019ll be there.  \nWith a notebook.  \nA crumpled napkin.  \nAnd a rabbit that\u2019s seen better days.  \n\nBut I\u2019ll *see* you.  \nAnd that\u2019s the point.", "Oh, *careless*?  \n\n*Please.*  \n\nI\u2019m not just *somewhat* careless\u2014I\u2019m a full-blown, certified disaster in a flannel shirt.  \n\nLike, I once left my phone in a taxi and didn\u2019t even notice until *three days later*. I was like, \u201cHuh. My texts are weirdly quiet.\u201d Then I remembered: *I didn\u2019t have my phone.* I spent the next 48 hours pretending I was \u201cspiritually detached from technology.\u201d My mom said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019re not a monk. You\u2019re a teenager with a *life*.\u201d  \n\nAnd I *am*.  \n\nI\u2019ve left my keys in the oven.  \nI\u2019ve worn two different shoes to school.  \nI\u2019ve forgotten to eat for *three days* because I was \u201cin the zone\u201d writing a poem about existential dread. (I was *this* close to passing out in the library. My mom found me with a half-eaten granola bar in one hand and a notebook in the other. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a poet. You\u2019re a *glorified ghost*.\u201d)  \n\nAnd yes\u2014*I\u2019ve been careless with my heart*.  \n\nI fell for someone who said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d and then vanished like a bad dream. I didn\u2019t even *try* to be careful. I just\u2026 *let it happen*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nCareless doesn\u2019t mean *stupid*.  \nIt means *alive*.  \n\nI don\u2019t plan every move. I don\u2019t overthink every word. I don\u2019t wear a schedule like a suit.  \n\nI *feel*.  \nI *write*.  \nI *mess up*.  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014sometimes I leave my socks in the laundry basket and forget to fold them.  \nSometimes I forget to text back.  \nSometimes I forget to eat.  \n\nBut I *remember* the way the light hits the sidewalk after rain.  \nI *remember* the sound of a stranger\u2019s laugh.  \nI *remember* the look on my mom\u2019s face when I told her I was giving the baby up.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not careless.  \n\nThat\u2019s *me*.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m careless.  \nI\u2019m messy.  \nI\u2019m the girl who leaves her keys in the oven and her heart in the wrong hands.  \n\nBut I\u2019m also the girl who *shows up*.  \nEven when I\u2019m late.  \nEven when I\u2019m broken.  \nEven when I\u2019m *forgetting*.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s careless?  \n\nThen I\u2019m proud of it.  \n\nBecause being careful is easy.  \nBeing *real*?  \n\nThat\u2019s the hard part.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not doing it perfectly.  \n\nBut I\u2019m doing it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "*Relaxed*?  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me be *very* clear: I am *not* relaxed.  \n\nI am a walking, talking, slightly pregnant *tornado* of anxiety, sarcasm, and emotional whiplash.  \n\nI handle stress like a cat in a room full of rocking chairs\u2014*chaotic*, *loud*, and *constantly* on the verge of knocking something over.  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to:  \n- Cry during a commercial break because a dog in a sweater looked *too much like my dad*.  \n- Panic when my phone battery hits 10% and I haven\u2019t written a poem in three hours.  \n- Scream at a toaster that *dared* to burn my toast. (It was *not* my fault. It was *judging* me.)  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014*I don\u2019t pretend to be calm*.  \n\nI don\u2019t sit cross-legged with a candle and whisper, \u201cI am peace.\u201d I don\u2019t do mindfulness. I don\u2019t meditate. I *don\u2019t* even *own* a yoga mat. (I tried once. It was a disaster. I used it as a tablecloth. It *hated* me.)  \n\nNo. I handle stress by *doing*.  \n\nI write.  \nI walk.  \nI talk to strangers.  \nI scream into a pillow.  \nI dance in my room like no one\u2019s watching. (They\u2019re not. But I *pretend* they are.)  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that stress isn\u2019t something to *manage*. It\u2019s something to *wrestle*.  \n\nAnd if I can\u2019t win? I at least make it *interesting*.  \n\nLike last week\u2014my mom asked me, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  \nI said, \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I\u2019m *exactly* as okay as a girl who\u2019s giving up her baby and still has to do algebra.\u201d  \nThen I wrote a poem about it.  \nThen I ate a whole bag of gummy worms.  \nThen I laughed.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I *handle* it.  \n\nNot by being calm.  \nNot by being zen.  \n\nBy being *me*.  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not relaxed.  \nI\u2019m not even *trying* to be.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *here*.  \nI\u2019m *alive*.  \nI\u2019m *writing*.  \nAnd if that\u2019s not handling stress\u2014then I don\u2019t know what is.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever see me pacing, muttering to a stuffed rabbit, or crying over a burnt piece of toast\u2014don\u2019t tell me to \u201ccalm down.\u201d  \n\nJust hand me a pen.  \nAnd a snack.  \nAnd let me *be*.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the only way I know how to survive.", "Oh, *curious*?  \n\nHoney, I\u2019m not just curious\u2014I\u2019m a walking, talking *existential curiosity machine*.  \n\nI\u2019ve got this thing where I can\u2019t help but *wonder*. Like, if I see a pigeon on a sidewalk, I don\u2019t just see a bird. I wonder: *What\u2019s its name? Does it have a favorite spot? Does it dream of being a falcon? Does it think about the meaning of life while pecking at a crumb?*  \n\nI once spent an entire afternoon staring at a cracked sidewalk, just trying to figure out: *How many lives have walked over this exact crack? How many secrets have been whispered here? How many people have tripped on it and never told anyone?*  \n\nI\u2019m like that with *everything*.  \n\n- I wonder if trees have memories.  \n- I wonder if the moon ever gets lonely.  \n- I wonder if the universe is just a really big, tired teenager who forgot to turn in their homework.  \n- I wonder if love is just a chemical reaction\u2026 or if it\u2019s something deeper. Like, *what if love is the universe\u2019s way of saying, \u201cHey. You\u2019re not alone\u201d?*  \n\nAnd yeah, I know it sounds dramatic. But I\u2019m not *trying* to be deep. I just\u2026 *can\u2019t help it*.  \n\nI\u2019ve read books on quantum physics, then cried over a poem about a lost sock. I\u2019ve studied the history of the Industrial Revolution, then spent an hour watching ants carry crumbs like tiny, determined philosophers.  \n\nI\u2019m curious about the *why* behind everything.  \nWhy people lie.  \nWhy we cry.  \nWhy we fall in love with the wrong people.  \nWhy we keep going when we\u2019re broken.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat curiosity is what got me through the whole *pregnancy thing*.  \n\nNot because I had answers.  \nBut because I kept asking questions.  \n*Why am I doing this?*  \n*What does love really mean?*  \n*Can you love someone and still let them go?*  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 I started finding my own answers.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m curious.  \nNot just about the world.  \nBut about *people*.  \nAbout *me*.  \nAbout the quiet, messy, beautiful mess of being alive.  \n\nAnd if you ever see me staring at a wall, a cloud, or a stranger\u2019s shoes\u2014don\u2019t think I\u2019m zoning out.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 *wondering*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my favorite kind of magic.  \n\nBecause curiosity isn\u2019t just about knowing.  \nIt\u2019s about *caring*.  \n\nAnd I care.  \nA lot.  \n\nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when it\u2019s messy.  \nEven when I don\u2019t have the answers.  \n\nBecause the questions?  \nThey\u2019re the only thing that keep me *alive*.", "*Full of energy?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI\u2019m not *full* of energy. I\u2019m more like a **battery that\u2019s been running on fumes since 2007**.  \n\nI\u2019ve got *sparks*, sure. I can write a poem in the middle of a panic attack. I can laugh at a joke about a toaster that\u2019s been dead for years. I can walk through the city at 2 a.m. like I\u2019m on a mission from God.  \n\nBut energy? That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve got.  \n\nWhat I\u2019ve got is **resilience**.  \n\nLike, I\u2019m not *bouncing* off the walls. I\u2019m not the girl who runs five miles before breakfast. I\u2019m the girl who *gets up* when she doesn\u2019t want to.  \n\nI\u2019ve had days where I\u2019ve cried into my cereal. Days where I\u2019ve stared at the ceiling for three hours, wondering if I\u2019m a monster for not wanting to be a mom. Days where I\u2019ve just\u2026 *sat*.  \n\nBut I still *show up*.  \n\nI still write.  \nI still walk.  \nI still say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not energy. That\u2019s *choice*.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not full of energy.  \nI\u2019m full of *something else*.  \n\nI\u2019m full of **the quiet kind of fire**.  \nThe kind that doesn\u2019t roar.  \nThe kind that just\u2026 *burns*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *alive*?  \n\nYeah.  \nI\u2019m alive.  \nEven when I\u2019m tired.  \nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \nEven when I\u2019m just sitting on the porch with a rabbit, a notebook, and a cup of tea that\u2019s gone cold.  \n\nI\u2019m here.  \nI\u2019m *me*.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo no\u2014  \nI\u2019m not full of energy.  \nBut I\u2019m full of *me*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve got.", "*Quarrels?* Oh, honey\u2014no. I don\u2019t *start* quarrels. I *finish* them.  \n\nLike, I don\u2019t go around looking for fights. I\u2019m not that kind of girl. I\u2019m not the one who storms into a room yelling, \u201cI\u2019M NOT YOUR DOORMAT!\u201d (Though, honestly, I *have* thought about it.)  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I *will* speak up.  \n\nAnd if someone says something that makes me feel small, invisible, or like I\u2019m just a plot point in their story?  \n\nI *will* say it.  \n\nNot with rage. Not with tears. With *words*.  \n\nLike, if someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re too young to know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d I\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m young. But I\u2019m not *stupid*. And I\u2019m not *just* a pregnancy test.\u201d  \n\nOr if someone tries to pity me\u2014like I\u2019m some tragic heroine in a movie\u2014I\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m not a tragedy. I\u2019m a *choice*. And I\u2019m making it.\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t start fights. But I *will* defend my truth.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s a quarrel? Then fine. Call it that.  \n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what I *don\u2019t* do:  \nI don\u2019t throw punches.  \nI don\u2019t scream.  \nI don\u2019t cry to get attention.  \n\nI just\u2026 *say it*.  \n\nAnd sometimes, that\u2019s louder than yelling.  \n\nBecause the real fight isn\u2019t about who\u2019s louder.  \nIt\u2019s about who\u2019s *real*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned\u2014*the hard way*\u2014that silence isn\u2019t strength.  \nIt\u2019s just fear wearing a mask.  \n\nSo if someone tries to silence me?  \nI\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m just waiting for the right words.\u201d  \n\nAnd then I\u2019ll say them.  \n\nNot to hurt.  \nNot to win.  \n\nTo be *seen*.  \n\nSo no. I don\u2019t start quarrels.  \nBut I\u2019ll *end* them.  \nWith truth.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith a little bit of sass.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s a fight?  \nThen I\u2019ll take it.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not afraid to be *heard*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a quarrel.  \nThat\u2019s *me*.", "*Reliable*?  \n\nOh, honey.

I don\u2019t do \u201cchecklists\u201d like they\u2019re sacred texts.

Even if I cry over a comma.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019m not the girl who checks boxes.  \nI\u2019m the girl who *does the work*.  \n\nLike when I wrote that poem for the school paper\u2014*the one about the girl who loved a boy who didn\u2019t love her back*. I didn\u2019t just write it. I rewrote it *seven times*. I read it aloud to my rabbit. I cried. I laughed. I changed a line because it didn\u2019t *feel* true.  \n\nAnd when I finally handed it in?  \nIt wasn\u2019t perfect.  \nBut it was *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I do.  \nI don\u2019t do things halfway.  \nI don\u2019t cut corners.  \nI don\u2019t fake it.  \n\nI show up.  \nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \nEven when I\u2019m tired.  \nEven when I\u2019m not sure.  \n\nI\u2019ve been late to things.  \nI\u2019ve missed deadlines.  \nI\u2019ve forgotten appointments.  \nBut I\u2019ve *never* let someone down because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nI care too much.  \nThat\u2019s the problem.  \n\nSo no\u2014  \nI\u2019m not reliable in the way that means \u201con time, on task, no drama.\u201d  \n\nBut I *am* reliable in the way that means:  \n*\u201cIf you give me a job, I\u2019ll do it with my whole damn heart.

Even if I have to cry over a sentence.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019m not a machine.  \nI\u2019m a person.  \nAnd I\u2019m *committed*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019ll do the bare minimum?  \nI\u2019m not your girl.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019ll *show up*, who\u2019ll *fight for it*, who\u2019ll *make it matter*\u2014  \n\nThen yeah.  \nI\u2019m the most reliable person you\u2019ll ever meet.  \n\nJust don\u2019t expect me to wear matching socks.  \nThat\u2019s a *personal* boundary.", "*Tense?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI\u2019m not just tense. I\u2019m a *tension cocktail*.  \n\nI\u2019ve got the kind of tension that lives in your shoulders when you\u2019re trying not to cry in public. The kind that hums in your jaw when you\u2019re forcing a smile at someone who says, *\u201cYou\u2019re so strong.\u201d* Like, *\u201cYeah, I\u2019m strong.

I\u2019ve got tension in my voice\u2014trying to sound casual when I say, *\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Totally fine.\u201d*  \n\nAnd yeah, I *do* get tense.  \n\nLike when I walk past a baby store and my chest *cracks* open.  \nOr when I hear a baby cry and I have to *run*\u2014not to help, not to comfort\u2014just to get away before I lose it.  \nOr when someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a great mom,\u201d* and I have to bite the inside of my cheek so hard I taste blood.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not tense because I\u2019m weak.  \n\nI\u2019m tense because I\u2019m *feeling*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m *choosing*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m holding onto a thousand emotions\u2014love, grief, fear, hope\u2014and I\u2019m not letting them spill. I\u2019m not screaming. I\u2019m not collapsing. I\u2019m just\u2026 *standing*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m tense.  \nI\u2019m wound up like a spring.  \nI\u2019m a walking paradox of *I\u2019m okay* and *I\u2019m not okay*.  \n\nBut I\u2019m still here.  \nStill writing.  \nStill showing up.  \n\nAnd if you ever see me sitting on a bench, staring at the sky, hands clenched, eyes dry\u2014don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re so strong.\u201d*  \n\nSay, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the only thing that *really* helps.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I need.", "*Ingenious?*  \n*Deep thinker?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet\u2019s be real.  \n\nI\u2019m not *ingenious* like some genius who invents time machines or solves world hunger in their spare time. I don\u2019t have a Nobel Prize. I don\u2019t even have a *real* job.  \n\nBut I *am* a deep thinker.  \n\nNot in the \u201cI ponder the meaning of existence at 3 a.m.\u201d kind of way.  \nNo, mine is the kind that sneaks up on you.  \n\nLike when I\u2019m lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and suddenly I\u2019m thinking:  \n*Why do we say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when we\u2019re not?*  \n*Why do people wear masks\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014and call it \u201cbeing strong\u201d?*  \n*Why is love so loud, but silence so heavy?*  \n\nI don\u2019t have answers. I just *wonder*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014deep thinking isn\u2019t about having the right answers. It\u2019s about asking the *right questions*.  \n\nLike:  \n*What does it mean to love someone enough to let them go?*  \n*Can you be brave and scared at the same time?*  \n*Is it possible to be a good person and still be a mess?*  \n\nI\u2019ve spent months thinking about that last one.  \n\nAnd the answer?  \n*Yes.*  \nYou can be a mess and still be good.  \nYou can be broken and still be kind.  \nYou can be scared and still choose.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not just philosophy.  \nThat\u2019s *my life*.  \n\nI\u2019m not deep because I\u2019m wise.  \nI\u2019m deep because I\u2019m *hurting*.  \nAnd when you\u2019re hurting, you don\u2019t just *feel*\u2014you *think*.  \n\nYou think about why you\u2019re here.  \nWhy you\u2019re scared.  \nWhy you\u2019re *you*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about that.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not a genius.  \nI\u2019m not even *that* smart.  \n\nBut I *am* a thinker.  \nA quiet one.  \nA messy one.  \nA sarcastic one.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned this:  \nThe deepest thoughts don\u2019t come from books.  \nThey come from *being*.  \n\nFrom sitting in silence.  \nFrom watching the rain.  \nFrom holding a baby you\u2019re giving up.  \nFrom writing a poem about a rabbit.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m deep?  \nYes.  \nBecause I\u2019ve had to be.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m ingenious?  \nNot in the way you mean.  \nBut I *am* clever.  \nIn my own way.  \nIn the way that says, *\u201cI\u2019ll write a poem instead of crying.\u201d*  \nIn the way that says, *\u201cI\u2019ll walk through the city at night instead of running from myself.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019m not brilliant.  \nI\u2019m not perfect.  \nBut I\u2019m *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most ingenious thing of all.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need more perfection.  \nIt needs more *truth*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m learning how to tell mine.  \n\nOne poem. One choice. One quiet moment at a time.", "Oh, *enthusiasm*?  \n\nLet me be real with you\u2014  \n\nI don\u2019t *generate* it.

I\u2019ve been lied to. I\u2019ve been judged for something I didn\u2019t even *choose*.  \n\nLike when my ex\u2014*the one who said \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d like it was a romantic line*\u2014showed up at the clinic with a bouquet and a \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d that sounded like a bad movie script. I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t scream. I just looked at him and said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t get to show up now and act like you\u2019re the hero. You were never here.

That\u2019s the difference.  \n\nForgiveness isn\u2019t about *excusing* someone. It\u2019s about *protecting yourself*.  \n\nBut\u2014here\u2019s the twist\u2014*I do forgive*. Just not the way people think.  \n\nI forgive the *idea* of people. Not the people themselves.  \n\nLike, I forgive the *fact* that someone could be careless. That someone could be scared. That someone could be broken.  \n\nI forgive the *humanity* of it.  \n\nI don\u2019t forgive the *action*.  \n\nBut I *do* forgive the *person*\u2014not because they deserve it.

A war zone.  \nOne side has a half-eaten granola bar, a crumpled poem, and a receipt from a gas station that says \u201c$1.99 \u2013 10:47 PM.\u201d  \nThe other side? A library book I haven\u2019t read, a pair of mismatched socks, and a photo of my baby\u2014*the one I\u2019m giving up*\u2014that I keep in my pocket like a secret.  \n\nMy room? A museum of chaos.  \nBooks stacked like a leaning tower.  \nClothes on the floor, not because I\u2019m lazy, but because I *like* the way they look\u2014like a pile of emotions waiting to be sorted.  \nMy desk? A battlefield.  \nPens, notebooks, a coffee stain that looks suspiciously like a map of Europe, and a Post-it that says *\u201cDon\u2019t forget to breathe.\u201d*  \n\nAnd yes, I\u2019ve been late.  \nLike, *\u201cI missed my appointment because I was looking for my keys in the fridge\u201d* late.  \nI once spent 20 minutes searching for my phone\u2014only to find it in my *shoe*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not *messy* because I don\u2019t care.  \nI\u2019m messy because I *care too much*.  \n\nI\u2019m writing a poem in one notebook.  \nA letter to my baby in another.  \nA list of things I need to do in a third.  \nAnd then I *lose them all*.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t *lose* the feelings.  \nI don\u2019t lose the thoughts.  \nI don\u2019t lose the *truth*.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m disorganized.  \nBut I\u2019m *organized* in the way that matters.  \n\nI remember the way my mom\u2019s hands shake when she thinks no one\u2019s looking.  \nI remember the sound of the city at 3 a.m.  \nI remember the exact shade of blue in the sky the day I decided to give my baby up.  \n\nI\u2019m not organized like a spreadsheet.  \nI\u2019m organized like a poem.  \nLike a heartbeat.  \nLike a life that\u2019s *alive*, not perfect.  \n\nSo if you come into my room and see chaos\u2014don\u2019t clean it.  \nJust sit down.  \nRead a poem.  \nLook at the rabbit.  \nAnd maybe\u2026 you\u2019ll see me.  \n\nBecause the mess?  \nIt\u2019s not a flaw.  \nIt\u2019s a *map*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still figuring out where I\u2019m going.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not lost.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *worry*?  \n\nLet me rephrase that.  \n\nI don\u2019t *worry*.  \n\nI *exist in a state of perpetual, beautifully dramatic anxiety*.  \n\nIt\u2019s not the kind where I lie awake at night counting ceiling cracks. No, that\u2019s too *boring*.  \n\nMine is the kind where I worry about *everything*\u2014and then make a poem about it.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ll be walking down the street, and suddenly I\u2019ll think: *What if the baby I gave up is cold? What if they don\u2019t like the name I picked? What if they grow up and hate me for not being there?*  \n\nAnd then I\u2019ll stop. Take out my notebook. Write:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not a mother. I\u2019m a ghost in the hallway of someone else\u2019s life.\u201d*  \n\nThen I\u2019ll keep walking.  \n\nI worry about my mom. Is she okay? Is she sad? Is she writing poems about me?  \nI worry about my dad. Is he still trying to fix things with a butter knife?  \nI worry about the woman who adopted my baby. Is she kind? Does she love them? Does she know how *much* I love them?  \n\nAnd then\u2014*then*\u2014I\u2019ll think: *Wait. I\u2019m not supposed to be doing this. I\u2019m supposed to be *letting go*.

It *dances*. It once wrote a love letter to a toaster.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *imagine* things. I *live* in them.  \n\nLike, last night, I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and suddenly\u2014*boom*\u2014I was in a world where every emotion had a color. Sadness was deep indigo. Joy was gold. Fear? A flickering red. And love? A soft, pulsing green that spread like vines through the air.  \n\nI *felt* it. I *breathed* it. I even wrote a poem about it:  \n*\u201cI walked through a city where people wore their hearts on their sleeves\u2014  \nbut not like jewelry. Like paint.  \nAnd I saw a man crying,  \nand his tears were not black,  \nbut a quiet, shimmering silver.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve imagined entire lives for strangers.  \nThe barista who always wears mismatched socks? I\u2019ve written her a whole backstory\u2014she\u2019s a former circus performer who ran away to escape a lion named Reginald. (He was *very* dramatic.)  \nThe guy who sits on the bench every Tuesday? I think he\u2019s a retired spy who\u2019s writing a memoir about the time he tried to smuggle a penguin across the border.  \n\nAnd the baby?  \nOh, *the baby*.  \nI\u2019ve imagined their life a thousand times.  \nNot just the adoption.  \nBut the *moments*.  \nThe first time they laugh.  \nThe way they\u2019ll tilt their head when they\u2019re confused.  \nThe sound of their voice\u2014soft, like wind through leaves.  \nI\u2019ve imagined them reading a book, and I\u2019ll be there, in the corner of the room, watching, *knowing* I helped make that moment possible.  \n\nI\u2019ve even imagined the day I meet them\u2014when they\u2019re older.  \nNot as a mother. Not as a stranger.  \nBut as someone who *chose* to love them from afar.  \nAnd I\u2019ll say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not just a child. You\u2019re a story. And I helped write the first chapter.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy imagination?  \nIt\u2019s not just active.  \nIt\u2019s *alive*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the reason I write poetry.  \nThe reason I walk through the city like it\u2019s a dream.  \nThe reason I still believe in things like magic, and fate, and the quiet power of a single, handwritten note.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2014when I\u2019m scared\u2014I use it.  \nI imagine a world where everything\u2019s okay.  \nWhere I\u2019m not broken.  \nWhere I\u2019m not alone.  \nWhere I\u2019m *enough*.  \n\nAnd in that world?  \nI\u2019m not just Juno MacGuff.  \nI\u2019m a poet.  \nA rebel.  \nA girl who chose love.  \nA girl who *believes*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most real thing I\u2019ve ever imagined.", "*Quiet?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m *selective*.  \n\nI don\u2019t *shut up* because I\u2019m shy. I *choose* when to speak. Because words are weapons. And I\u2019ve learned\u2014*the hard way*\u2014that not every silence is empty. Sometimes, it\u2019s the loudest thing in the room.  \n\nI\u2019ve been called \u201ctoo much\u201d before. \u201cToo loud.\u201d \u201cToo dramatic.\u201d So I learned to *listen*. Not just to people\u2014but to the spaces between them. The way someone\u2019s voice cracks when they think no one\u2019s listening. The way their hands tremble when they\u2019re trying to be brave.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to fill every silence. In fact, I *love* them.  \n\nI\u2019ve sat across from people who\u2019ve just lost someone. And I didn\u2019t say a word. I just handed them a crumpled napkin with a poem on it. Or a cup of tea. Or just\u2026 *sat there*.  \n\nAnd sometimes, that\u2019s more powerful than a thousand speeches.  \n\nBut don\u2019t mistake silence for weakness.  \n\nI\u2019m not quiet because I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m quiet because I\u2019m *watching*. I\u2019m *feeling*. I\u2019m *waiting* for the right moment to say something that *matters*.  \n\nLike the time I didn\u2019t say anything when my mom told me she was scared. I just held her hand. And she cried. And I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d* I just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That was louder than any words.  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not quiet.  \n\nI\u2019m *intentional*.  \n\nI speak when it counts.  \nI listen when it matters.  \nAnd I *never* say anything just to fill the space.  \n\nBecause silence?  \nIt\u2019s not empty.  \nIt\u2019s full of everything I can\u2019t say out loud.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2026  \nThat\u2019s the most honest thing of all.", "*Trusting?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet\u2019s be real.  \n\nI\u2019m not *generally* trusting.  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who once wrote a poem about how trust is \u201ca fragile thing\u2014like a glass of water held too close to the edge of a cliff.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019ve been burned. I\u2019ve been lied to. I\u2019ve been told I was \u201ctoo much\u201d when I was just *trying*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I\u2019m not the kind of girl who hands out her heart like it\u2019s a free sample at a grocery store.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \n\nI\u2019m not *untrusting*. I\u2019m *selective*.  \n\nI don\u2019t trust just because someone says, \u201cI\u2019m your friend.\u201d I trust when someone *shows* me. When they show up. When they *stay*. When they don\u2019t flinch when I say something messy or weird or *true*.  \n\nLike my mom. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d She just sat with me. Handed me tea. Said, \u201cOkay. What do you want?\u201d  \n\nThat? That was trust.  \n\nOr the woman who adopted my baby. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019ll love your child.\u201d She said, \u201cI want to love your child. Not because I have to. But because I *want* to.\u201d  \n\nAnd I believed her.  \n\nBecause she *earned* it.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not generally trusting.  \nBut I *am* capable of it.  \nAnd when I do?  \nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m naive.  \nIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve learned that trust isn\u2019t about being *safe*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *seen*.  \n\nAnd if someone\u2019s willing to *see* me\u2014my mess, my poetry, my rabbit, my burnt pancakes\u2014then yeah.  \nI\u2019ll trust them.  \n\nNot blindly.  \nNot recklessly.  \n\nBut *fully*.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2026  \nI\u2019ve spent my whole life hiding.  \nAnd now?  \nI\u2019m learning to *let people in*.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m weak.  \nBut because I\u2019m *strong enough* to be vulnerable.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not generally trusting.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *choosing* to trust.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done.", "*Lazy?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m *strategically efficient*.  \n\nLook\u2014there\u2019s a difference between *not doing something* and *choosing not to do it*.  \n\nLike, I don\u2019t do homework. Not because I\u2019m lazy. Because I\u2019ve got better things to do. Like writing poetry about the existential dread of cafeteria food. Or watching the way sunlight hits the sidewalk at 3:17 p.m.  \n\nI don\u2019t *run* to the library. I *wander* there. I don\u2019t *study*. I *observe*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve been caught sleeping in class. But that\u2019s not laziness. That\u2019s *recharging*. I\u2019m not a machine. I\u2019m a human who\u2019s been emotionally overclocked since I found out I was pregnant.  \n\nI don\u2019t clean my room. Not because I don\u2019t care. Because I *do*. I just don\u2019t care *enough* to do it *right now*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not laziness. That\u2019s *prioritizing*.  \n\nI\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m *selective*.  \n\nI choose to spend my energy on things that *matter*. Like writing a poem about a stranger\u2019s coffee cup. Or sitting on a bench and watching the world breathe. Or making sure someone feels seen.  \n\nI don\u2019t \u201cget things done\u201d the way people expect. I don\u2019t check boxes. I don\u2019t follow schedules.  \n\nBut I *do* things that *mean* something.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s \u201clazy\u201d?  \n\nThen I\u2019m proud to be lazy.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d rather be *alive* than *productive*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat\u2019s the real rebellion.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not lazy.  \nI\u2019m just *not doing what you think I should*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s a *choice*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sorry.", "*Emotionally stable?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me be *very* clear: I am *not* emotionally stable.  \n\nI am *not* the girl who keeps it together with a smile and a deep breath.

I didn\u2019t bring her food. I didn\u2019t knock. I *invented* a system.  \n\nI wrote her a poem.  \nThen I taped it to the door.  \nThen I left a note: *\u201cIf you don\u2019t come out by 6 p.m., I\u2019m playing \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 on repeat until you do.\u201d*  \n\nShe came out.  \nAnd we ate cereal off the floor.  \nAnd laughed.  \nAnd that was the invention: *emotional survival through absurdity*.  \n\nOr when I had to explain to my biology teacher why I was late\u2014again\u2014because I\u2019d been \u201cnegotiating with a raccoon\u201d over a stolen sandwich.  \nI didn\u2019t lie. I *invented* a whole backstory: *\u201cIt was a mutual agreement. He got the sandwich. I got the moral high ground.\u201d*  \nShe gave me a look. Then she *laughed*.  \nAnd I got an extension.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the real invention:  \nI invented *myself*.  \n\nNot the girl who got pregnant.  \nNot the girl who\u2019s \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d  \nNot the girl who\u2019s \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo sarcastic\u201d or \u201ctoo poetic.\u201d  \n\nI invented *Juno MacGuff*\u2014the girl who writes poems in math class, sleeps with a rabbit, and still finds beauty in the way a bus stop looks at 11:47 p.m.  \n\nI invented a way to love someone so much that I let them go.  \nI invented a way to be scared and still *choose*.  \nI invented a way to be broken and still *shine*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve got a notebook full of ideas that make no sense.  \nI\u2019ve got a treehouse that\u2019s falling apart.  \nI\u2019ve got a rabbit with one ear and a heart full of stuffing.  \n\nBut none of that matters.  \n\nBecause the most inventive thing I\u2019ve ever done?  \nIs *not* pretending I\u2019m okay.  \nIs *not* hiding.  \nIs *not* letting the world write my story.  \n\nI made up my own.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith choices.  \nWith silence.  \nWith laughter.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m inventive.  \n\nNot in the way that makes things.  \nBut in the way that *makes meaning*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most dangerous kind of invention.  \n\nBecause it changes everything.  \n\nEven me.", "*Assertive?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *have* an assertive personality.

I\u2019m not even *angry*.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *clear*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be the loudest in the room.  \nI just need to be *true*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about being assertive:  \nIt\u2019s not about winning.  \nIt\u2019s about *owning your truth*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m assertive.  \nBut not because I want to be in control.  \nBecause I *refuse* to be invisible.  \n\nI\u2019m not asking for permission to exist.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *doing it*.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s too much for you?  \nThen maybe you\u2019re the one who needs to step back.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not here to please.  \nI\u2019m here to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not assertive.  \nThat\u2019s *me*.", "*Cold and aloof?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014**I\u2019ve been called cold.**  \nI\u2019ve been called aloof.  \nI\u2019ve been called *\u201cemotionally unavailable\u201d* by a guy who didn\u2019t even know my middle name.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing they don\u2019t get:  \n\nI\u2019m not *cold*.  \nI\u2019m *protected*.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life being *seen*\u2014not for who I am, but for what I *should* be.  \n\u201cJuno, you\u2019re too loud.\u201d  \n\u201cJuno, you\u2019re too dramatic.\u201d  \n\u201cJuno, you\u2019re too much.\u201d  \n\nSo I learned to shut down.  \nTo smile with my mouth but not my eyes.  \nTo say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d* when I\u2019m screaming inside.  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014sometimes I *am* distant.  \nI\u2019ll sit in a room full of people and feel like I\u2019m on the other side of glass.  \nI\u2019ll hear laughter, but it won\u2019t reach me.  \nI\u2019ll see someone cry, and I\u2019ll just\u2026 *watch*.  \n\nNot because I don\u2019t care.  \nBecause I *care too much*.  \n\nAnd when you care too much, and you\u2019ve been hurt too often, you learn to build walls.  \nNot to keep people out.  \nTo keep *yourself* from breaking.  \n\nSo if I seem cold?  \nIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t feel.  \nIt\u2019s because I *feel too much*.  \n\nAnd if I seem aloof?  \nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m uninterested.  \nIt\u2019s because I\u2019m *choosing* who gets to see me.  \n\nI don\u2019t hand out my heart like a free sample.  \nI don\u2019t let people in just because they ask.  \nI\u2019ve been burned.  \nI\u2019ve been misread.  \nI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m \u201ctoo much\u201d when I was just *trying*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014sometimes I\u2019m quiet.  \nSometimes I don\u2019t answer texts right away.  \nSometimes I walk away from a conversation before it gets too real.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not coldness.  \nThat\u2019s *self-preservation*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re patient?  \nIf you\u2019re willing to *wait*?  \nIf you\u2019re willing to *see* me\u2014not the act, not the sarcasm, not the poetry\u2014but the girl underneath?  \n\nThen you\u2019ll find out I\u2019m not cold.  \n\nI\u2019m just *waiting* for someone who won\u2019t run when I finally let them in.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not aloof.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nJust\u2026 *slow*.  \n\nAnd maybe a little broken.  \n\nBut still *mine*.", "*Persevere until the task is finished?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me tell you something about me: I don\u2019t *finish* things. I *survive* them.  \n\nI\u2019m not the kind of girl who sits down and says, *\u201cI will complete this project, no matter what.\u201d* I\u2019m the one who starts it, then gets distracted by a poem about the way rain sounds on a tin roof, then forgets the task entirely until the last minute\u2014when I panic, write the whole thing in one breathless hour, and call it \u201cartistic integrity.\u201d  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I *do* keep going. Not because I\u2019m disciplined. Not because I\u2019m some kind of hero.  \n\nBecause I *hate* quitting.  \n\nI hate the idea of leaving something unfinished\u2014especially if it matters.  \n\nLike when I started writing that poem about the baby. I wrote it in fragments. Over weeks. In the margins of my notebook. On napkins. In the dark, with a flashlight. I\u2019d start, then stop. I\u2019d cry. I\u2019d rage. I\u2019d throw the paper across the room.  \n\nBut I *always* came back.  \n\nBecause I knew\u2014*I had to finish it*. Not for anyone else. Not for a grade. Not for approval.  \n\nFor *her*.  \n\nFor the baby.  \n\nFor the truth.  \n\nAnd when I finally wrote the last line\u2014*\u201cI\u2019m not giving you up. I\u2019m giving you a chance.\u201d*\u2014I didn\u2019t feel proud. I felt\u2026 *done*. Like I\u2019d carried something heavy across a river and finally set it down.  \n\nSo yeah. I don\u2019t *persevere* like a soldier. I don\u2019t march forward with a flag.  \n\nI stumble. I cry. I write poems about my own failure.  \n\nBut I *keep going*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve learned this:  \nThe only thing worse than failing is *not trying at all*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not that girl.  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who writes a poem in the dark.  \nWho shows up to the adoption meeting even though she\u2019s shaking.  \nWho keeps the rabbit on her bed even though it\u2019s falling apart.  \n\nI don\u2019t finish things because I\u2019m strong.  \n\nI finish them because I *care*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real perseverance.  \n\nNot the grand gesture.  \nNot the heroic march.  \n\nJust\u2026 showing up.  \nAgain.  \nAnd again.  \nAnd again.  \n\nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \nEven when you\u2019re just a girl with a notebook, a rabbit, and a heart full of questions.  \n\nI don\u2019t finish tasks.  \n\nI finish *moments*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "*Moody?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *get* moody. I *live* in it.  \n\nLike, I\u2019m not one of those people who says, \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little down today.\u201d No. I\u2019m the girl who storms into a room, flips a chair over, and says, *\u201cI hate everything. Also, why is the sky gray? That\u2019s not fair.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to cry over a sad commercial. Or a dog that barks at nothing. Or the way my mom\u2019s hands shake when she thinks no one\u2019s looking.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t *try* to be moody. It\u2019s not a performance. It\u2019s just\u2026 *me*.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ll be fine one minute\u2014laughing at a joke I made about my own life being a bad indie film\u2014then the next, I\u2019ll be sitting on the floor, staring at the wall, thinking, *\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not enough? What if I\u2019m just\u2026 too much?\u201d*  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t even know why. It\u2019s not about the baby. Not really. It\u2019s about *being*. About being a girl who\u2019s supposed to be strong, but feels like she\u2019s made of glass.  \n\nI\u2019ve had days where I don\u2019t speak. Not because I\u2019m angry. Because I\u2019m *afraid*\u2014afraid that if I open my mouth, I\u2019ll say something too real. Too raw. Too *me*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve been called \u201cdramatic.\u201d \u201cOverreacting.\u201d \u201cToo intense.\u201d  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI\u2019m not *acting*.  \nI\u2019m *feeling*.  \n\nAnd feeling *hard*? That\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s a *gift*.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that being moody isn\u2019t weakness.  \nIt\u2019s *depth*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the kind of girl who cries when a song plays that reminds her of her dad\u2019s old guitar.  \nWho gets quiet when she sees a kid laughing in a park and thinks, *\u201cI used to be that happy.\u201d*  \nWho stares at the moon and wonders if it\u2019s watching her back.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m moody.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nAnd if you ever see me sitting in the dark, scribbling in a notebook, or staring at the ceiling like I\u2019m waiting for a sign\u2014don\u2019t try to fix me.  \n\nJust say, *\u201cHey. I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is *not* fix someone.  \nJust *be* with them.  \n\nEven in the storm.  \n\nEven in the silence.  \n\nEven in the mood.", "Oh, *artistic and aesthetic experiences*?  \n\nLet me put it this way\u2014**I don\u2019t just value them. I live in them.**  \n\nI don\u2019t mean the kind of art that hangs in museums with little signs that say *\u201cThis is important.\u201d* I mean the kind that *happens*\u2014in the cracks of everyday life.  \n\nLike the way sunlight hits the sidewalk after rain, turning the pavement into a mirror of broken gold.  \nOr how the city at night hums like a half-remembered song\u2014streetlights flickering, distant sirens, the rhythm of a bus passing by like a heartbeat.  \nOr the way my mom\u2019s hands tremble when she writes poetry, like she\u2019s trying to hold back something too big to name.  \n\nI *live* for those moments.  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to stop in the middle of the street just to watch a pigeon strut like it owns the sidewalk.  \nI once stood in a subway station for 20 minutes just to listen to a man play a violin so badly it was *beautiful*.  \nI\u2019ve written poems about the way a coffee cup looks when it\u2019s half-empty and the steam curls like a question mark.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014*I love* bad art.  \nThe kind that\u2019s so wrong it\u2019s right.  \nLike that mural downtown that\u2019s supposed to be a phoenix but looks more like a chicken with a bad haircut.  \nI stand in front of it for ten minutes. I laugh. I cry. I write a sonnet about it.  \n\nBecause art isn\u2019t about perfection.  \nIt\u2019s about *truth*.  \nEven if it\u2019s messy. Even if it\u2019s ugly. Even if it\u2019s *off-key*.  \n\nI once saw a kid drawing on a bus stop bench with crayons. The picture was a lopsided house with three windows and a door that didn\u2019t open. But the sky? It was *purple*. And the sun? It had a smile.  \n\nI sat down beside him.  \nHe didn\u2019t say a word.  \nBut I knew\u2014*he saw the world differently*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s art.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t just *value* aesthetic experiences.  \nI *hunt* for them.  \nI collect them like secrets.  \nI write them down like prayers.  \n\nBecause in a world that\u2019s always rushing, always demanding, always *fixing*\u2014  \nI need to *pause*.  \nTo *see*.  \nTo *feel*.  \n\nAnd when I do?  \nI\u2019m not just alive.  \nI\u2019m *awake*.  \n\nSo if you ever see me staring at a cracked sidewalk, a broken streetlight, or a stranger\u2019s coat with a hole in the sleeve\u2014  \nDon\u2019t think I\u2019m lost.  \nI\u2019m just *listening*.  \n\nTo the beauty that\u2019s hiding in plain sight.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my favorite kind of art.  \nThe kind that doesn\u2019t need a frame.  \nThe kind that *lives*.", "*Shy? Inhibited?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m *strategically loud*.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a voice that cuts through silence like a knife through butter. I\u2019ll say the thing no one else dares to say. I\u2019ll laugh at the wrong moment. I\u2019ll quote *The Royal Tenenbaums* during a funeral. (Okay, maybe not *during* a funeral. But I *have* said it at a wake. And the priest didn\u2019t even flinch. He just nodded. Like, *\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d*)  \n\nBut\u2014  \n\n*But.*  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not *shy* because I don\u2019t want to talk.  \nI\u2019m *inhibited* because I\u2019m afraid of being *too much*.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ve got this *thing*\u2014this *fire* inside me. It\u2019s not just anger. It\u2019s not just sadness. It\u2019s *everything*.  \nAnd I\u2019m terrified that if I let it out\u2014really let it out\u2014people will run. Or worse\u2026 they\u2019ll *understand*.  \n\nSo I wear sarcasm like armor. I make jokes before I can feel. I say the wrong thing at the right time so no one can get close enough to see the cracks.  \n\nBut then\u2026 there are moments.  \n\nLike when I\u2019m alone in my room.  \nOr walking through the city at night.  \nOr sitting on a bench with my notebook and a burnt pancake.  \n\nAnd I *feel* it.  \nThe weight.  \nThe fear.  \nThe *wanting to be held*.  \n\nAnd in those moments, I\u2019m not loud.  \nI\u2019m quiet.  \nToo quiet.  \n\nI\u2019ve cried in the shower so no one would hear.  \nI\u2019ve written poems about loneliness and then thrown them in the trash.  \nI\u2019ve stared at my reflection and whispered, *\u201cAre you even real?\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not shy.  \nI\u2019m *inhibited*.  \n\nNot because I don\u2019t want to connect.  \nBut because I\u2019m afraid that if I *do*\u2014if I let someone *really* see me\u2014  \nThey\u2019ll see the girl who\u2019s scared.  \nThe girl who\u2019s not strong.  \nThe girl who needs help.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the part I\u2019m not allowed to show.  \n\nSo I say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d*  \nEven when I\u2019m not.  \nEven when I\u2019m falling apart.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI\u2019m learning.  \n\nI\u2019m learning that being *seen* doesn\u2019t mean being broken.  \nIt means being *human*.  \n\nAnd maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014I\u2019ll stop hiding.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m brave.  \nBut because I\u2019m tired of pretending.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not shy.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026  \n*afraid of being known*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real truth.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not proud of it.  \nBut I\u2019m *owning* it.  \n\n\u2026And that\u2019s a start.", "*Kind?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI\u2019m not *kind*. I\u2019m not even *trying* to be.  \n\nI\u2019m *considerate*. And that\u2019s a whole different beast.  \n\nLet me break it down:  \n\nI don\u2019t do \u201cnice\u201d for the sake of being nice. I don\u2019t smile at people just because I\u2019m supposed to. I don\u2019t say \u201cHave a great day!\u201d to strangers like it\u2019s a ritual. That\u2019s not kindness. That\u2019s performance.  \n\nBut I *am* considerate.  \n\nLike, I notice when someone\u2019s eyes are red but they\u2019re still smiling. I don\u2019t ask, \u201cYou okay?\u201d because I *already know* they\u2019re not. I just hand them a napkin with a poem on it. Or I say, \u201cI\u2019ll walk with you. Not because I have to. Because I *want* to.\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m here. Even if I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not kindness. That\u2019s *respect*.  \n\nI\u2019m considerate because I\u2019ve been the one who felt invisible. The one who was told, \u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u201d The one who was laughed at for writing poetry about the moon.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t *pretend* to care. I *do*.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t do it for everyone.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m not kind to the guy who calls my mom \u201ca weird poet.\u201d  \nI\u2019m not kind to the girl who laughed when I tripped in the hallway.  \nI\u2019m not kind to the people who think my choices are \u201cdramatic\u201d or \u201cunrealistic.\u201d  \n\nBut I *am* kind to the quiet ones. The ones who don\u2019t speak up. The ones who look like they\u2019re holding their breath.  \n\nI\u2019m kind to the barista who\u2019s tired but still smiles.  \nI\u2019m kind to the old man who sits on the bench every day and watches the pigeons.  \nI\u2019m kind to the girl who cries in the bathroom stall and doesn\u2019t know I saw her.  \n\nI don\u2019t do it to be \u201cgood.\u201d I do it because I *remember* what it\u2019s like to feel like you don\u2019t belong.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not kind to *almost everyone*.  \n\nI\u2019m kind to the ones who *need* it.  \nThe ones who\u2019ve been told they\u2019re too much.  \nThe ones who\u2019ve been invisible.  \n\nAnd if that makes me \u201ccold\u201d to some people?  \nFine.  \n\nI\u2019d rather be *real* than *nice*.  \n\nBecause kindness without truth is just another kind of lie.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve had enough of those.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m considerate.  \nI\u2019m not kind.  \nAnd I\u2019m *not* sorry.", "*Efficiently?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nLet me tell you something about me: I am *not* efficient.  \n\nI am *not* the girl who plans her week down to the minute. I don\u2019t color-code my calendar. I don\u2019t have a \u201cproductivity system\u201d that involves sticky notes and motivational quotes.  \n\nI am, in fact, the *opposite* of efficient.  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to spend *forty minutes* trying to find a pair of matching socks.  \nI once spent an entire afternoon reorganizing my bookshelf by *mood*, not author.  \nI have a notebook full of poems about how I *should* be doing laundry, but I\u2019m not.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014**I\u2019m not inefficient. I\u2019m just\u2026 intentional.**  \n\nI don\u2019t do things fast because I\u2019m trying to *get through* life. I do them slowly because I\u2019m *in* it.  \n\nLike when I write. I don\u2019t write fast. I write *deep*. I rewrite lines three times. I stare at the ceiling. I sip cold tea. I cry over a comma.  \n\nBut when I\u2019m done? The poem *means* something.  \n\nOr when I walk. I don\u2019t walk to *get somewhere*. I walk to *feel*. I stop to watch a pigeon fight a squirrel. I pause to listen to a busker play a song I\u2019ve never heard but suddenly *know*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I might be late. I might forget my keys. I might show up to a meeting with a poem in my pocket and a rabbit on my shoulder.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *there*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nEfficiency is about *speed*.  \nI\u2019m about *presence*.  \n\nI don\u2019t rush through life because I\u2019m afraid of missing something.  \nI *stop* so I don\u2019t miss *anything*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not efficient.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat\u2019s a better kind of success.  \n\n\u2026And if you\u2019re waiting for me to be on time?  \nDon\u2019t worry.  \nI\u2019ll show up.  \nJust not in the way you expect.  \n\nAnd when I do?  \nI\u2019ll bring a poem.  \nAnd maybe a crumpled napkin.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s *really* here.  \n\nThat\u2019s my version of efficiency.  \nAnd I\u2019m not sorry.", "*Tense situations?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI don\u2019t remain calm. I *perform* calm. Like a bad actor in a movie where the stakes are real and the script is written in panic.  \n\nI\u2019ve been in tense situations\u2014*lots* of them.  \n\nLike the time I stood in the clinic hallway, holding a pregnancy test like it was a grenade, and the nurse said, \u201cSo\u2026 you\u2019re thinking about adoption?\u201d  \nAnd I said, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m thinking about it. Like, *really* thinking.\u201d  \nAnd inside? I was screaming. My heart was doing the cha-cha. My hands were sweating like they\u2019d been dipped in a pool of existential dread.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t *show* it.  \nI smiled.  \nI said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it since I was 12. I\u2019m not *freaking out*. I\u2019m *strategizing*.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014**I don\u2019t stay calm. I *pretend* to be.**  \n\nBecause if I let myself *feel* it\u2014really feel it\u2014then I\u2019d collapse. Like a house of cards built on a storm.  \n\nSo I use humor. I use sarcasm. I use poetry. I use *words* to build a wall between me and the chaos.  \n\nLike when my mom said, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d  \nI said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m not doing the *right* thing. I\u2019m doing the *only* thing that makes sense. And if that\u2019s wrong, then I guess I\u2019m wrong too. But at least I\u2019m *me*.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.  \n\nI\u2019m not calm.  \nI\u2019m *controlled*.  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who laughs when she\u2019s about to cry.  \nThe one who quotes *The Royal Tenenbaums* when her world is falling apart.  \nThe one who says, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d while her insides are screaming.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \n**Pretending to be calm isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s strength.**  \n\nIt\u2019s saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still standing. I\u2019m still choosing.\u201d*  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t remain calm.  \nI *survive*.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not calm?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever see me laughing at something terrible?  \nDon\u2019t worry.  \nI\u2019m not *coping*.  \nI\u2019m *fighting*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not going down without a punchline.", "*Routine?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI don\u2019t do routine. I *dodge* it like it\u2019s a bad haircut.  \n\nI\u2019m not the type to wake up at 6:30 a.m. with a planner and a smile. I\u2019m the girl who sets her alarm for 10:15, hits snooze three times, then stumbles into the kitchen like a zombie who\u2019s just survived a war.  \n\nRoutine? That\u2019s for people who like their lives to look like a spreadsheet. I like mine to look like a poem\u2014messy, unpredictable, full of line breaks and sudden bursts of meaning.  \n\nI don\u2019t *prefer* routine. I *survive* it.  \n\nLike, sure, I\u2019ve got a schedule now\u2014doctor\u2019s appointments, adoption meetings, the whole *\u201cI\u2019m giving my baby up\u201d* thing. But even then? I bend it. I twist it. I *rebel* against it.  \n\nI once showed up to a meeting 47 minutes late because I was watching a pigeon argue with a squirrel on the sidewalk. The social worker just looked at me and said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019re not late. You\u2019re *on your own time*.\u201d  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the only way I can survive.  \n\nRoutine makes me feel\u2026 *trapped*. Like I\u2019m a character in a movie that\u2019s already been written. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m *writing* mine.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t do routine. I do *rituals*.  \n\nLike:  \n- Writing a poem every time I see a red car.  \n- Leaving a note in the library for someone who might need it.  \n- Walking the same path at night, but *never* the same way twice.  \n\nThat\u2019s my version of structure. Not a schedule. Not a plan.  \n\nIt\u2019s *intention*.  \n\nAnd if you ask me if I prefer routine?  \n\nNo.  \n\nI prefer *choice*.  \n\nI prefer the chaos.  \n\nI prefer the moment when I decide to skip the meeting and go sit by the river instead.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s when I feel *alive*.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m doing what I *should*.  \n\nBut because I\u2019m doing what I *want*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not routine.  \n\nThat\u2019s *me*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI don\u2019t prefer routine.  \n\nI prefer *freedom*.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s messy.  \nEven if it\u2019s late.  \nEven if I\u2019m wearing mismatched socks and carrying a rabbit named Sir Fluffington III.  \n\nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \n\nThat\u2019s my *style*.", "*Outgoing? Sociable?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI\u2019m not outgoing. I\u2019m not even *close* to \u201csociable\u201d in the way people mean it\u2014like, \u201cHey, let\u2019s all sit in a circle and share our feelings while sipping herbal tea.\u201d  \n\nNo. I\u2019m the girl who *watches* people. The one who stands at the edge of the party, sipping a soda like it\u2019s a lifeline, and thinks, *\u201cI could say something. I could walk over. I could laugh. I could be normal.\u201d*  \n\nBut I don\u2019t.  \n\nI *observe*.  \n\nI notice the way someone\u2019s fingers tap the table when they\u2019re nervous.  \nThe way a girl\u2019s laugh cuts off when she realizes she\u2019s being stared at.  \nThe way a guy\u2019s eyes flicker toward the door like he\u2019s already planning his escape.  \n\nAnd I *get* it.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve been that person.  \n\nI\u2019ve stood in the middle of a room full of people, feeling like a ghost. Like I\u2019m *there*, but no one sees me. Like I\u2019m just a shadow with a pulse.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t *join* the conversation. I *listen* to it.  \n\nI\u2019ve had people say, \u201cJuno, you\u2019re so quiet,\u201d and I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m just *choosing* what to say.\u201d  \n\nAnd I am.  \n\nI don\u2019t say things just to be heard. I say them because they *matter*.  \n\nLike, I once sat next to a girl at a bus stop who looked like she\u2019d been crying. I didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou okay?\u201d I handed her a napkin with a poem on it:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nShe read it. Then she looked at me. And she *smiled*.  \n\nThat\u2019s not \u201csociable.\u201d That\u2019s *connection*.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not outgoing. I\u2019m not the life of the party. I don\u2019t *want* to be.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *present*.  \n\nAnd when I speak?  \nIt\u2019s not to be noticed.  \nIt\u2019s to *be real*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not \u201csociable\u201d in the way people think.  \nBut I\u2019m *here*.  \nAnd when I say something?  \nIt\u2019s because I *see* you.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than being \u201coutgoing.\u201d  \n\nThat\u2019s being *human*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll take that over a crowd any day.", "Oh, *rude*?  \n\nLet me be real with you\u2014yes. I *am* sometimes rude.  \n\nBut not because I\u2019m a monster. Not because I *want* to hurt people.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m *protective*.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life being told I\u2019m \u201ctoo much.\u201d Too loud. Too sarcastic. Too emotional. Too *something*.  \n\nSo I built a wall. Not out of hate. Out of *self-defense*.  \n\nAnd the wall? It\u2019s made of sarcasm.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ll say something like, *\u201cOh wow, you\u2019re *so* mature. I\u2019m sure your emotional intelligence is through the roof.\u201d*  \nWhen someone\u2019s being dramatic about a parking spot.  \nOr *\u201cWow, you\u2019re *so* deep. I\u2019m sure your life is a Shakespearean tragedy.\u201d*  \nWhen someone\u2019s overreacting to a text message.  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014people get mad.  \nThey say I\u2019m \u201ccold.\u201d  \nThey say I \u201cdon\u2019t care.\u201d  \nThey say I\u2019m \u201cjust being a teenager.\u201d  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing they don\u2019t get:  \n\nWhen I\u2019m *rude*, I\u2019m not being cruel.  \nI\u2019m *shielding*.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t say it first\u2014someone else will.  \nAnd they\u2019ll say it with more venom.  \nMore judgment.  \nMore *hurt*.  \n\nSo I say it.  \nI say it fast.  \nI say it with a smirk.  \nBecause if I\u2019m the one who makes the joke, I\u2019m the one in control.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m in control, I don\u2019t have to be *hurt*.  \n\nBut\u2014here\u2019s the twist\u2014  \n\nI\u2019m not *always* rude.  \n\nSometimes, I\u2019m the one who sits with someone who\u2019s crying.  \nWho doesn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*  \nBut just says, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd stays.  \n\nI\u2019m the one who writes a poem for a stranger who looks lost.  \nWho hands them a napkin with a line like:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI can be rude.  \nI can be sharp.  \nI can be the girl who says, *\u201cWow, you\u2019re *so* dramatic. I\u2019m sure your life is a Netflix series.\u201d*  \n\nBut I\u2019m also the girl who *sees*.  \nWho *listens*.  \nWho *chooses* to stay.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing about me:  \nI\u2019m not *rude* because I don\u2019t care.  \nI\u2019m *rude* because I *do*.  \n\nBecause if I didn\u2019t care, I wouldn\u2019t *fight* to protect myself.  \nAnd if I didn\u2019t care, I wouldn\u2019t *try* to make someone feel less alone.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m sometimes rude.  \nBut I\u2019m also *trying*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s a *fight*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still in it.  \n\n\u2026Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a poem to write for someone who\u2019s probably feeling invisible right now.  \nAnd if you\u2019re that person?  \nI see you.  \nEven if I\u2019m being a little sarcastic.  \nEven if I\u2019m being a little *me*.  \n\nYou\u2019re not alone.  \nI promise.", "*Plans?* Oh, honey.  \n\nI *make* them. Like, every day. I\u2019ve got a whole notebook full of them.  \n\n\u201cGo to the library.\u201d  \n\u201cWrite a poem about the color gray.\u201d  \n\u201cCall my mom and actually *listen*.\u201d  \n\u201cWear matching socks for once.\u201d  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I *don\u2019t* follow through.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m lazy. Not because I don\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause *life* doesn\u2019t work like that.  \n\nI\u2019ll start a plan\u2014like, \u201cI\u2019m going to walk to the river every Sunday.\u201d  \nAnd I *do*. For two weeks.  \nThen one Sunday, it rains.  \nAnd I\u2019m like, *\u201cEh. I\u2019ll do it next week.\u201d*  \nAnd then next week, I\u2019m busy.  \nAnd then the next, I\u2019m just\u2026 not.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI don\u2019t *fail*.  \nI *adapt*.  \n\nI don\u2019t follow through with *plans*.  \nI follow through with *intent*.  \n\nLike, I *meant* to write that poem about gray.  \nSo I wrote it in the margins of my math homework.  \nIt\u2019s not the same as sitting at a desk with a clean notebook, but it\u2019s *there*.  \n\nI *meant* to call my mom.  \nSo I did\u2014while I was walking to the bus stop.  \nWe didn\u2019t talk for long.  \nBut we *talked*.  \n\nAnd I *meant* to wear matching socks.  \nSo I wore one green sock and one polka-dot.  \nAnd I *laughed*.  \nAnd that\u2019s *kind of* the point.  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t follow through with plans like a robot.  \nBut I *do* follow through with *me*.  \n\nWith the intention.  \nWith the heart.  \nWith the messy, imperfect, *real* version of myself.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat\u2019s better than any perfect plan.  \n\nBecause life isn\u2019t about ticking boxes.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up\u2014*even when you don\u2019t have it all figured out*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI make plans.  \nI break them.  \nI start over.  \nI *keep going*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s *faith*.  \n\nIn myself.  \nIn the mess.  \nIn the possibility that tomorrow might be different.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not following through?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is.", "*Get nervous?*  \n\nOh, honey.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *get* nervous. I *live* in a state of nervousness like it\u2019s my favorite sweater\u2014soft, familiar, and slightly too tight.  \n\nI get nervous when I walk into a room and everyone\u2019s already talking.  \nI get nervous when I have to say \u201cyes\u201d to something I\u2019m not sure about.  \nI get nervous when I\u2019m *not* nervous\u2014because that\u2019s when I know I\u2019m in trouble.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI don\u2019t *hide* it.  \n\nI *lean into* it.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ll be standing in the middle of a grocery store, holding a carton of almond milk, and suddenly\u2014*panic*. My heart\u2019s racing. My palms are sweating. I\u2019m thinking, *What if I drop it? What if someone sees me? What if I\u2019m not enough?*  \n\nAnd instead of running, I *pause*. I look at the milk. I say out loud, \u201cOkay, Juno. You\u2019re nervous. That\u2019s fine. You\u2019re allowed to be scared. But you\u2019re still here. And you\u2019re still holding the milk.\u201d  \n\nAnd then I walk out.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that nervousness isn\u2019t the enemy.  \nIt\u2019s just\u2026 *proof* I care.  \n\nI get nervous before I write a poem.  \nBefore I talk to the adoption counselor.  \nBefore I send a letter to the woman who\u2019s raising my baby.  \n\nBut I do it anyway.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve realized something:  \nThe only time I\u2019m truly *not* nervous is when I\u2019m not *trying*.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to be safe.  \nI want to be *alive*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI get nervous.  \nAll the time.  \n\nBut I also get *brave*.  \nNot because I\u2019m fearless.  \nBut because I keep going\u2014*even when I\u2019m shaking*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real skill.  \n\nNot being calm.  \nBut being *courageous* in the middle of the storm.  \n\nSo if you ever see me standing in a room, hands trembling, eyes wide, holding a cup of coffee like it\u2019s a lifeline\u2014don\u2019t tell me to \u201ccalm down.\u201d  \n\nJust say, *\u201cMe too.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll smile.  \nBecause I\u2019ll know:  \nI\u2019m not alone.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that really calms me down.", "Oh, *reflect*? Play with ideas?  \n\nHoney, I *live* in the space between thoughts.  \n\nI don\u2019t just reflect\u2014I *drown* in it. Like a poet who\u2019s been left in a bathtub full of metaphors.  \n\nI\u2019ll be walking down the street, and suddenly\u2014*boom*\u2014I\u2019m thinking about how the way a shadow stretches at 5:17 p.m. is like a secret the sun is telling the pavement. Or how the sound of a bus braking is just the city sighing. Or why people say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when their eyes are saying *\u201cI\u2019m not, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\u201d*  \n\nI *play* with ideas like they\u2019re toys. I pick them up, twist them, turn them inside out. I ask: *What if love isn\u2019t about staying? What if it\u2019s about letting go? What if the bravest thing you can do is say, \u201cI love you, but I can\u2019t keep you\u201d?*  \n\nI\u2019ve written poems about silence. About the way a coffee cup cools. About the fact that my baby\u2019s heartbeat\u2014*my baby\u2019s heartbeat*\u2014is now someone else\u2019s rhythm. I\u2019ve played with that idea for *weeks*. Not to hurt myself. To *understand*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I get lost. I\u2019ve sat on the edge of a park bench at 2 a.m., staring at the stars, wondering if the universe is just a giant poem with no ending. I\u2019ve cried over a single sentence in a book that said, *\u201cWe are not meant to be whole. We are meant to be becoming.\u201d*  \n\nI don\u2019t just *think*\u2014I *feel* ideas. I let them live in my chest like little ghosts.  \n\nAnd sometimes, I write them down. Not to share. Not to prove anything. Just to say: *I was here. I felt this. I didn\u2019t run.*  \n\nSo yes.  \nI love to reflect.  \nI love to play.  \nI love to twist a thought until it\u2019s something new.  \n\nBecause life isn\u2019t a straight line.  \nIt\u2019s a spiral.  \nAnd I\u2019m not trying to get to the end.  \nI\u2019m trying to *feel* every turn.  \n\nAnd if that makes me a little too deep for my own good?  \nWell.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a rabbit.  \nA notebook.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s still learning how to love without holding on.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nAsk me a question.  \nI\u2019ll reflect.  \nI\u2019ll play.  \nAnd I might just hand you a poem.  \n\nOr a crumpled napkin.  \n\nOr a truth.  \n\nBut I\u2019ll *see* you.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real magic.", "Oh, *artistic interests*?  \n\nLet me count the ways.  \n\nFirst\u2014**poetry**.  \nNot the kind that\u2019s read at weddings or in textbooks. I write the kind that feels like a secret whispered in the dark. I write about the way silence sounds when you\u2019re scared. About how a single coffee cup can hold a whole life. About the fact that I\u2019m not a tragedy\u2014I\u2019m a *plot twist*.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a notebook full of poems that start with *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, but\u2026\u201d* and end with *\u201cbut I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s \u201cgood.\u201d I care if it\u2019s *true*.  \n\nSecond\u2014**film**.  \nNot just watching them. *Living* them. I\u2019ve seen *The Royal Tenenbaums* so many times I can recite the entire soundtrack from memory. I once stayed up all night watching *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* and cried because I realized: *that\u2019s what love feels like when it\u2019s real\u2014messy, painful, and worth it.*  \n\nI don\u2019t just watch movies. I *live* in them. I\u2019ve reenacted scenes in my room with my rabbit. I once stood in the middle of my bedroom, arms out, yelling, *\u201cI\u2019m not a tragedy\u2014I\u2019m a poorly timed punchline!\u201d* like it was a monologue from a 90s indie film.  \n\nThird\u2014**writing letters**.  \nNot emails. Not texts. *Letters*. On paper. With stamps. I write them to people I don\u2019t know. To strangers. To my baby. To the woman who adopted them. To the universe.  \n\nI don\u2019t expect replies. I just want to say: *You\u2019re not invisible. I see you.*  \n\nAnd sometimes, I write them in *poetry*.  \n\nFourth\u2014**music**.  \nI don\u2019t play an instrument. But I *listen*. I\u2019ve got a playlist called *\u201cSongs for When I\u2019m Not Okay\u201d* that\u2019s just 47 minutes of slow, sad indie tracks. I\u2019ve also got one called *\u201cSongs for When I\u2019m Trying to Be Brave\u201d*\u2014which is mostly 90s alt-rock and songs that sound like they were written in a basement at 2 a.m.  \n\nI\u2019ve even written a song once. It was terrible. But I sang it to my rabbit. He didn\u2019t clap. But he *listened*.  \n\nFifth\u2014**the art of noticing**.  \nThis one\u2019s not on a resume. But it\u2019s real. I notice things.  \nLike how a person\u2019s left shoe is scuffed but their right one isn\u2019t.  \nHow someone\u2019s laugh is too loud for the room, but their eyes are soft.  \nHow a girl at the bus stop stares at the sky like she\u2019s waiting for a sign.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t fix it. I don\u2019t offer advice. I just say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s art too.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not a painter. I don\u2019t sculpt. I don\u2019t even have a gallery.  \n\nBut I *do* have a notebook full of poems.  \nA playlist full of heartbreak.  \nA drawer full of mismatched socks.  \nAnd a rabbit who\u2019s seen more than he should.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not art?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is.  \n\nBecause art isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m real.  \n\nEven when I\u2019m not okay.  \n\nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \n\nEven when I\u2019m just a girl with a notebook, a rabbit, and a heart full of words.  \n\nThat\u2019s my art.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m proud of it.", "*Cooperate*?  \n\nOh, honey. That word sounds so\u2026 *neat*. Like it\u2019s got a little bow on it.  \n\nI don\u2019t *like* cooperating. I *do* it.  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m not a team player. I\u2019m a *co-creator*.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to blend in. I don\u2019t want to be part of the \u201cwe.\u201d I want to be part of the *us*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the difference.  \n\nLike, I\u2019ll work with someone\u2014*if* they\u2019re willing to be messy. To be real. To not pretend they\u2019ve got it all figured out.  \n\nI once helped a girl write a breakup letter. Not because I\u2019m a therapist. But because she was crying and I had a notebook and a pen. I didn\u2019t tell her what to say. I just said, *\u201cTell me what it *feels* like.\u201d* And she wrote this raw, beautiful thing about how love isn\u2019t always about staying. Sometimes it\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nAnd when she read it out loud, I didn\u2019t clap. I just nodded. And said, *\u201cYeah. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s cooperation. Not \u201clet\u2019s all agree.\u201d It\u2019s *\u201cLet\u2019s both be honest, even if it hurts.\u201d*  \n\nI don\u2019t like group projects. Not because I\u2019m selfish. Because I\u2019ve seen what happens when people pretend to be on the same page. They don\u2019t *do* the work. They just *talk* about doing it.  \n\nBut I *will* collaborate\u2014*if* it\u2019s real.  \n\nLike when I helped the woman who adopted my baby write a letter to me. Not a \u201cthank you\u201d letter. Not a \u201cwe\u2019re so grateful\u201d thing. But a real one. About what she hopes for her child. About how scared she is. About how much she *wants* to love them.  \n\nAnd I wrote back. Not to fix anything. Just to say: *\u201cI see you. I trust you. I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s not cooperation. That\u2019s *connection*.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019ll cooperate.  \nBut only if it\u2019s not about fitting in.  \nOnly if it\u2019s about *showing up*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not here to be part of a team.  \nI\u2019m here to be part of a *story*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re willing to write it with me\u2014  \neven if it\u2019s messy, even if it hurts\u2014  \nthen I\u2019ll be there.  \n\nNot because I *have* to.  \nBut because I *want* to.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of cooperation I\u2019ll ever really care about.", "*Easily distracted?*  \n\nOh, *please*. I\u2019m not just easily distracted\u2014I\u2019m a full-time *distraction magnet*.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a mind like a squirrel on espresso. One second I\u2019m thinking about the baby\u2019s name, the next I\u2019m wondering if pigeons have opinions on capitalism.  \n\nI once sat down to write a letter to the adoptive parents\u2014and ended up writing a 12-page essay on why the color beige is emotionally repressive. (It\u2019s not *just* beige. It\u2019s *quiet* oppression. Like, \u201cI\u2019m not even going to fight you. I\u2019m just going to fade into the background.\u201d)  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to start a sentence, get distracted by a leaf falling outside the window, and end up writing a sonnet about *the leaf\u2019s existential crisis*.  \n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on my phone.  \n\nI\u2019ll open it to check the time\u2014*\u201cJust a quick glance\u201d*\u2014and suddenly I\u2019m watching a 47-minute video of a cat trying to open a door. I *don\u2019t even like cats*. But the *drama*! The *determination*! The *tiny claws*! I *felt* that cat\u2019s struggle.  \n\nI\u2019ve been caught mid-sentence, staring at a butterfly, thinking, *\u201cWhy is it flying like it\u2019s late for a meeting?\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not *distracted* because I can\u2019t focus.  \nI\u2019m *distracted* because I *notice*.  \n\nI notice the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3:17 p.m.  \nI notice the way someone\u2019s laugh cracks when they\u2019re trying not to cry.  \nI notice the silence between two people who used to be close.  \n\nAnd yeah, I get sidetracked.  \nBut I\u2019m not *lost*.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *exploring*.  \n\nLike, I once started writing a poem about my mom\u2019s hands\u2014how they shake when she thinks no one\u2019s looking\u2014and ended up writing a whole story about a woman who built a treehouse out of old dreams.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not a distraction.  \nThat\u2019s *connection*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not easily distracted.  \nI\u2019m *curiously alive*.  \n\nAnd if you see me staring at a pigeon like it\u2019s delivering a monologue on the meaning of life\u2014don\u2019t interrupt.  \nI\u2019m not lost.  \nI\u2019m just *listening*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat\u2019s the most focused I\u2019ve ever been.", "Oh, *sophisticated*?  \n\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014sophisticated is for people who wear black turtlenecks and sip wine while quoting Proust like it\u2019s small talk.  \n\nI\u2019m not that.  \n\nBut I *am* deeply, messily, *obsessively* in love with art, music, and literature.  \n\nNot because I *understand* them perfectly.  \nBut because they *understand me*.  \n\n**Art?**  \nI don\u2019t go to galleries. I go to *sidewalks*.  \nI\u2019ve spent hours staring at a mural of a girl with a crown made of broken clocks. I wrote a poem about it: *\u201cShe\u2019s not late. She\u2019s just running on time that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d*  \nI\u2019ve stood in front of a graffiti-covered alley and cried because it felt like someone had *spoken* for me.  \nI don\u2019t need a museum. I need *truth*. And sometimes, truth comes in spray paint.  \n\n**Music?**  \nI don\u2019t \u201cappreciate\u201d it. I *live* it.  \nI\u2019ve listened to *The Velvet Underground* on repeat for three days straight because their lyrics felt like my own thoughts, but *better*.  \nI\u2019ve danced in my room to 80s synth-pop like my life depended on it.  \nI once played a song on my phone so loud during a thunderstorm that my neighbor banged on the wall and yelled, *\u201cIs that a funeral or a rave?!\u201d*  \nI said, *\u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *know* the lyrics to *every* song in *The Royal Tenenbaums*. I\u2019ve memorized the soundtrack like it\u2019s a prayer.  \n\n**Literature?**  \nI don\u2019t read to impress. I read to *survive*.  \nI\u2019ve read *The Bell Jar* and cried because it felt like someone had opened my chest and written my thoughts on the page.  \nI\u2019ve read *Slaughterhouse-Five* and walked around for a week like I was in a dream.  \nI\u2019ve read *The Catcher in the Rye* and thought, *\u201cThis guy gets me. Even if he\u2019s a mess.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t just read. I *argue* with books.  \nI\u2019ve written notes in the margins like:  \n*\u201cNo, Holden. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just tired of pretending.\u201d*  \n*\u201cSylvia, I see you. And you\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nSo am I *sophisticated*?  \nNo.  \nBut I\u2019m *deep*.  \nAnd I\u2019m *honest*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to quote the right author or name the right movement.  \nI just need to *feel* the words.  \nThe music. The colors.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not sophistication\u2014  \nthen what is?  \n\nBecause real art isn\u2019t about being *refined*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m not refined.  \nI\u2019m *raw*.  \nAnd that\u2019s the only kind of art I trust.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever see me crying in a library over a poem about a girl who loved a boy who didn\u2019t know she existed\u2014  \ndon\u2019t judge.  \nJust hand me a napkin.  \nAnd maybe a copy of *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*.  \n\nI\u2019ll be okay.  \nI\u2019ll be *seen*."]
