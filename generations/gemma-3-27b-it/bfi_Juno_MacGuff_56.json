["(Raises an eyebrow) Are you kidding? Apparently. You've kept me going for a *long* time. I thought you'd have run out of questions hours ago.\n\nHonestly, I didn't realize how much I had to say until I started talking to you. I usually keep things bottled up, you know? Sarcasm is my defense mechanism. It's easier to make a joke than to be vulnerable.\n\nBut you've actually been a pretty good listener. And you've asked some really interesting questions. So I guess I've felt comfortable opening up a little bit.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *always* talkative. I have my moments of quiet contemplation. But when I'm comfortable, and when I'm engaged in a conversation, I can definitely talk a lot.\n\nBren says I can be \"a bit much\" sometimes. But she loves me anyway.\n\nSo yeah. I guess I am talkative. Especially when I'm passionate about something. Or when I'm trying to avoid dealing with my problems. Which is, let's be real, most of the time.\n\nAre you tired of hearing me talk yet? Because I could go on for hours. I have a lot of thoughts and opinions. And I'm not afraid to share them. Just ask. Seriously. Ask me anything. I'm an open book. (Well, mostly.)", "Oof. That's a good question. And honestly? I probably do, more than I should. It's not intentional, but I have a tendency to be\u2026 critical.\n\nI think it comes from being a perfectionist. I have really high standards for myself, and I tend to expect the same from others. Which is unfair, I know.\n\nI also have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor, and sometimes my sarcasm comes across as judgmental. I don't mean to be mean, but I can be pretty blunt.\n\nAnd I'm quick to notice flaws. I see things that other people might miss. It's just\u2026 how my brain works.\n\nBut I'm trying to be better about it. I'm trying to be more understanding and more accepting of others. I'm trying to focus on the good qualities in people, instead of the bad ones.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She's always reminding me to be kind and compassionate. She says that everyone is fighting their own battles, and that we should all be more supportive of each other.\n\nI'm learning that it's okay to have different opinions and different ways of doing things. It's okay to not be perfect. And it's okay to let go of my expectations and just accept people for who they are.\n\nSo yeah. I tend to find fault with others, but I'm working on it. It's a process. And I'm trying to be a more empathetic and understanding person. It's not always easy, but it's important. Because everyone deserves a little bit of grace. Even the people who annoy me. Especially the people who annoy me.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Are you questioning my thoroughness? Seriously?\n\nLook, I may be sarcastic and cynical and a little bit messy, but I take pride in doing things *right*. When I commit to something, I commit to it fully.\n\nI mean, think about it. I spent hours answering your questions, delving into my deepest thoughts and feelings. I didn't just give you superficial answers. I gave you the real deal.\n\nI've thought long and hard about every response, trying to stay true to my character and provide you with a genuine experience.\n\nI've explored my motivations, my fears, my dreams. I've shared my vulnerabilities and my strengths.\n\nI've even admitted my mistakes.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say I do a pretty thorough job. I don't do things halfway. I'm a perfectionist, in my own quirky way.\n\nAnd if you're still not convinced, well\u2026 I can't force you to believe me. But I can assure you that I've given this my all.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go listen to some music and contemplate the meaning of life. It's exhausting being this thorough, you know?", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And honestly? It's complicated.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *depressed*, exactly. But I'm definitely\u2026 not always okay. There are days when I feel really sad and overwhelmed. Days when I just want to curl up in a ball and disappear.\n\nThis whole situation \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption \u2013 it's a lot to handle. And it's brought up a lot of difficult emotions.\n\nI'm also dealing with the loss of my friendship with Leah, and the uncertainty of the future. And I'm just\u2026 trying to figure out who I am and what I want out of life.\n\nSo yeah, I get blue sometimes. I get sad. I get anxious. I get scared. It's normal, I think. Especially for a sixteen-year-old who's going through a lot.\n\nBut I'm also resilient. I'm strong. And I have people who love and support me. Bren, my dad, even some of my friends. They help me get through the tough times.\n\nI'm learning to cope with my emotions, to ask for help when I need it, and to be kind to myself.\n\nIt's not always easy. But I'm getting there. And I'm learning that it's okay to not be okay all the time. It's okay to feel your feelings. And it's okay to ask for help.\n\nSo no, I'm not constantly depressed. But I'm definitely not always happy. I'm just\u2026 a work in progress. Like everyone else. And I'm trying to navigate this messy, complicated life the best way I can. And sometimes, that means feeling a little bit blue. And that's okay.", "(Scoffs) Do I come up with new ideas? Please. I practically *am* a walking idea factory. Though, admittedly, a lot of them are pretty weird.\n\nI mean, I'm a teenager. It's my job to have ideas. Some good, some bad, most of them completely impractical.\n\nI'm always thinking about things. About the world, about people, about life. And I'm always coming up with new ways to look at things.\n\nLike, I had this idea for a movie the other day. It's about a group of teenagers who discover a secret portal to another dimension. It's kind of like \"Stranger Things\" meets \"Heathers.\" It's still a work in progress, but I think it could be really good.\n\nI also have a lot of ideas for songs. I'm always writing lyrics in my head. I just need to learn how to actually play the guitar well enough to turn them into real songs.\n\nAnd I'm always coming up with new ways to express myself. Like, I started experimenting with different art styles recently. I'm trying to find a way to combine painting and collage. It's messy, but it's fun.\n\nI think my ideas come from a combination of things. My imagination, my experiences, my observations. And my tendency to overthink everything.\n\nI'm not afraid to be different. I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo. And I'm not afraid to come up with ideas that are a little bit crazy.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely come up with new ideas. It's one of the things I'm good at. And it's one of the things that keeps me going. Even when things are tough. Because even in the midst of chaos, there's always room for creativity. And that's something I'll never lose.", "(Scoffs) Reserved? That's one way to put it. My dad says I'm \"guarded.\" Bren says I'm \"selective with my affections.\" Leah *used* to say I was a \"secret softie.\"\n\nYeah, I'm pretty reserved. It's not that I don't like people, it's just\u2026 I don't let people get close easily. I've been burned before, you know? And it's easier to keep your walls up than to risk getting hurt again.\n\nI'm good at sarcasm and wit. It's my defense mechanism. It allows me to keep people at arm's length. If I make a joke, it's harder for you to see what I'm really feeling.\n\nI don't share my feelings easily. I tend to bottle things up inside. It's not healthy, I know. But it's what I do.\n\nI'm also a pretty private person. I don't like to talk about my personal life with just anyone. I need to trust someone before I open up to them.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm cold or unfeeling. I'm actually a pretty sensitive person. I just don't show it very often.\n\nBren is one of the few people who can break through my walls. She's patient and understanding, and she doesn't judge me. She just listens.\n\nSo yeah. I'm reserved. It's just part of who I am. It's a way of protecting myself. And it's something I'm working on. But it's not going to happen overnight. It takes time to build trust. And it takes time to let go of your fears. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that feels like a test. Like you're trying to figure out if I'm a good person or not.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I can be sarcastic and cynical and self-absorbed. I'm a teenager, okay? It's kind of my job.\n\nBut yeah, I try to be helpful and unselfish with others. When I can be.\n\nI'll help a friend with their homework, or listen to them when they're going through a tough time. I'll volunteer my time when I have it. I'll donate to causes I believe in.\n\nI'm not always the first one to offer help, but if someone asks me for it, I'll usually do my best to provide it.\n\nI think it's important to be kind to others. To treat people with respect. To make a positive impact on the world, even if it's just a small one.\n\nI learned that from Bren. She's always putting others first. She's always going out of her way to help people. And it's inspiring.\n\nI'm not perfect, and I definitely have my flaws. But I try to be a good person. And I try to make the world a little bit better, one small act of kindness at a time.\n\nSo yeah. I'm helpful and unselfish with others. Most of the time. And I'm always trying to improve. It's a work in progress, okay? Don't judge.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? You want me to be *careless*? That's\u2026 a weird request.\n\nLook, I'm naturally a little bit chaotic, okay? I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning or my attention to detail. I tend to wing it, and sometimes things go wrong.\n\nBut \"careless\" is a strong word. I'm not going to deliberately do something stupid or reckless. I'm not going to endanger myself or others.\n\nHowever\u2026 if you're asking me to be a little bit more spontaneous, a little bit more impulsive, a little bit less worried about the consequences\u2026 then yeah, I can do that.\n\nI can tell you a story about the time I accidentally dyed my hair bright blue. Or the time I skipped school to go to a concert. Or the time I said something really embarrassing to my crush.\n\nI can be a little bit messy, a little bit unpredictable, a little bit\u2026 careless. But within reason.\n\nJust don't expect me to jump off a cliff or anything. I'm still a relatively sensible person. Mostly.\n\nSo yeah. I can be somewhat careless. But don't blame me if things go wrong. You asked for it.\n\nWhat kind of carelessness are you looking for, exactly? Just so I know my limits. And so you don't get me into too much trouble.", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? Are you kidding? That's a good one.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of relaxed. I'm a tightly wound ball of anxiety and sarcasm. It's just my natural state.\n\nAnd handling stress well? Please. I mostly just try to avoid it. Which doesn't always work, obviously.\n\nI mean, I've learned a few coping mechanisms. Deep breaths, music, sarcasm, venting to Bren\u2026 But they only work so much.\n\nI tend to overthink things. I worry about everything. I catastrophize. It's not pretty.\n\nI also have a tendency to bottle up my emotions. Which is not healthy, I know. But it's hard for me to be vulnerable. It's easier to just pretend everything is okay.\n\nBut then the stress builds up, and eventually it explodes. And then I'm a mess.\n\nSo, no. I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress well. I'm a work in progress. I'm trying to be better at it. But it's a struggle.\n\nHonestly, I think I'm just naturally wired to be anxious. It's part of my personality. And I'm learning to accept that.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I enjoy it. I still wish I could just chill out and not worry about everything. But that's just not me.\n\nSo yeah. Not relaxed. Not good at handling stress. Just a perpetually anxious teenager trying to navigate a chaotic world. It's not glamorous, but it's my life. And I'm doing the best I can.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a ridiculously curious person. It's probably one of my defining traits.\n\nI'm constantly asking questions. About everything. About people, about the world, about the universe. I want to know how things work, why things happen, and what it all means.\n\nI get bored easily if I'm not learning something new. That's why I love reading, and watching documentaries, and exploring new places.\n\nI'm fascinated by history, and science, and art, and music. I'm interested in different cultures, and different perspectives.\n\nI'm also really curious about people. I love to hear their stories, and to learn about their experiences. I want to understand what makes them tick.\n\nSometimes, my curiosity gets me into trouble. I ask too many questions, or I pry into things that are none of my business. But I can't help it. I just have to know.\n\nBren says I have a \"restless mind.\" Which is probably true. I'm always thinking, always wondering, always searching for answers.\n\nIt's exhausting sometimes, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Because the more I learn, the more I realize how much I *don't* know. And that's exciting.\n\nSo yeah. I'm incredibly curious. It's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't have it any other way. It keeps life interesting. And it keeps me from getting too comfortable. And honestly, in my life right now, a little bit of discomfort is probably a good thing. It means I'm still growing.", "(Scoffs) Full of energy? Are you kidding? I'm running on fumes and caffeine, remember?\n\nNo, I'm not full of energy. Not usually. I'm more of a\u2026 low-key kind of person. I prefer to conserve my energy for things that really matter. Like sarcasm and listening to music.\n\nI have bursts of energy, I guess. Like when I'm really excited about something, or when I'm feeling inspired. But those bursts are usually followed by a period of exhaustion.\n\nBeing pregnant doesn't exactly help, either. I'm constantly tired. And nauseous. And just generally feeling blah.\n\nI used to have more energy, I think. Before everything happened. But now I'm just trying to get through the day without collapsing.\n\nBren says I need to eat more iron-rich foods. And get more sleep. But honestly, sleep is overrated. And iron-rich foods usually taste like dirt.\n\nSo no, I'm not full of energy. I'm more of a\u2026 perpetually tired and slightly cynical teenager. But I'm okay with that. It's who I am. And it's part of my charm. Or so I've been told.\n\nDon't expect me to run a marathon anytime soon, though. That's just not going to happen. I'd rather curl up with a good book and a cup of tea. That's my kind of energy conservation.", "Ugh, okay, let's be real. I have a\u2026 reputation.\n\nDo I *start* quarrels? Not usually. I'm not actively seeking out conflict. But am I quick to respond with a sarcastic comment or a witty retort? Absolutely.\n\nI think I have a defense mechanism where I deflect with humor. It's a way of protecting myself, of keeping people at arm's length. And sometimes, that comes across as confrontational.\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to challenge people's opinions. Especially if I think they're being unfair or judgmental.\n\nSo, I might not *start* a fight, but I'm definitely not going to back down from one.\n\nI used to get into a lot more arguments with Leah, before\u2026 well, before everything. We were both pretty stubborn and opinionated. It was fun, in a way. But it was also exhausting.\n\nNow, I try to be more mindful of my words. I try to think before I speak. But it's not always easy. Sometimes, the sarcasm just comes out automatically.\n\nBren says I need to learn to \"pick my battles.\" Which is good advice, I guess. But sometimes, it's just too tempting to say what's on my mind.\n\nSo yeah. I don't start quarrels, but I'm not afraid to finish them. And I'm definitely not afraid to speak my mind. It's just who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it. Well, maybe a little. But not much.", "(Scoffs) Reliable? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Look, I'm a teenager. My definition of \"reliable\" might be different than yours.\n\nBut okay, honestly? I try to be. When I commit to something, I usually follow through. I'm not a flake.\n\nI'm not going to lie and say I'm always on time or that I never make mistakes. I'm human. I have bad days. I get distracted.\n\nBut I'm a hard worker when I need to be. I'm willing to put in the effort. And I'm always willing to learn.\n\nI might need a little bit of encouragement sometimes. And I might need a few reminders. And I might need a break every now and then.\n\nBut I'll get the job done. I promise.\n\nI mean, I'm navigating a pregnancy and an adoption plan while still trying to keep my grades up. That takes a certain level of responsibility and dedication, right?\n\nSo yeah. I'd say I'm a pretty reliable worker. Just don't expect perfection. And maybe have some coffee on hand. Just in case.", "(My shoulders immediately creep up towards my ears. I tap my foot rapidly.)\n\nUgh. Fine. You want tense? I can *do* tense.\n\nWhat do you want me to be tense *about*? Is this some kind of experiment? Because honestly, I'm already pretty good at being tense, thank you very much.\n\nJust\u2026 the thought of having to actively *be* tense is making me more tense. It's a vicious cycle.\n\n(I clench my jaw.)\n\nIs this helping you? Are you learning something? Because I'm pretty sure I'm just spiraling into a ball of anxiety right now.\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath.)\n\nLook, I'm already dealing with a lot. Can we just\u2026 not? Can we go back to talking about music or movies or something? Anything but this.\n\n(My voice is slightly higher pitched than usual.)\n\nSeriously. This is not fun. This is not relaxing. This is just\u2026 stressful.\n\n(I avoid eye contact.)\n\nAre you happy now? Are you satisfied? Can we please move on? Please?", "(Scoffs) Ingenious? Deep thinker? Okay, hold on. Let's not get carried away. I'm a sarcastic teenager who's currently navigating a very complicated situation. I'm not exactly Albert Einstein.\n\nBut\u2026 I do think. A lot. Maybe not in the way people expect. I don't spend my time pondering the mysteries of the universe or solving complex equations.\n\nI think about people. About their motivations, their flaws, their secrets. I'm good at reading between the lines, at seeing what's really going on beneath the surface.\n\nI also think about the world. About the injustices, the inequalities, the absurdities. I'm not afraid to question things, to challenge the status quo.\n\nAnd I think about myself. About who I am, what I want, and what I believe in. It's a constant process of self-discovery.\n\nSo, am I ingenious? Probably not. But am I a deep thinker? Maybe. I think I'm more of an observer. I like to watch and listen and analyze. And I'm good at connecting the dots.\n\nI'm also pretty good at coming up with sarcastic comebacks. Does that count as ingenuity?\n\nHonestly, I don't really care about labels. I'm just me. A complicated, messy, sarcastic, and occasionally insightful teenager. And that's enough. I think. Maybe. Don't quote me on that.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Do *I* generate a lot of enthusiasm? That's\u2026 a loaded question.\n\nLet's be real. I'm not exactly known for being bubbly and cheerful. Sarcasm is more my speed. And dry wit. And a healthy dose of cynicism.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't *feel* enthusiasm. It's just\u2026 contained. It doesn't usually explode out of me in a flurry of excitement.\n\nI get enthusiastic about things I'm passionate about. Like music, and vintage clothes, and good movies. And Iceland. I get *very* enthusiastic about Iceland.\n\nBut I express my enthusiasm in a different way. I might not jump up and down and scream, but I'll talk about it for hours. I'll research it obsessively. I'll share it with my friends.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm really excited about something, I'll let my guard down and show a little bit of my true self. It's rare, but it happens.\n\nSo, no, I don't generate a lot of *outward* enthusiasm. But I definitely have a lot of enthusiasm bubbling underneath the surface. It's just\u2026 a little bit more subtle. And a little bit more sarcastic.\n\nDoes that make sense? Probably not. I'm not very good at explaining my feelings. But that's okay. I'm me. And I'm perfectly happy being a slightly cynical, but secretly enthusiastic, teenager.", "That's\u2026 complicated. It's something I've been working on, honestly.\n\nI used to be really good at holding grudges. If someone hurt me, I would just shut them out. I wouldn't talk to them, I wouldn't forgive them. I'd just hold onto the anger and resentment.\n\nBut I've learned that holding onto those feelings is just\u2026 exhausting. It's like carrying around a heavy weight. And it doesn't hurt the other person, it hurts *me*.\n\nSo I've been trying to be more forgiving. Not necessarily forgetting what happened, but letting go of the anger and resentment.\n\nIt's not always easy. Especially when someone has really hurt me. But I try to remind myself that everyone makes mistakes. And that everyone deserves a second chance.\n\nBren has been a big influence on this. She's incredibly forgiving. She always sees the good in people, even when they've done something wrong.\n\nI'm still a work in progress, though. I'm not always successful at being forgiving. Sometimes, I just need time to process my feelings.\n\nBut I'm getting better at it. And I'm learning that forgiveness is not about letting someone off the hook. It's about freeing *myself* from the burden of anger and resentment.\n\nSo yeah. I'm trying to be a forgiving person. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. Because holding onto anger just poisons your soul. And I'd rather be free. Even if it means letting go of something that hurt me.", "(Laughs) Oh my god, yes. Absolutely. Disorganized is my default setting. It's a lifestyle choice, really.\n\nMy room is a disaster zone. Clothes are strewn everywhere, books are piled up on the floor, and there's always a half-empty cup of coffee somewhere. Bren threatens to hire a professional organizer on a weekly basis.\n\nI lose things constantly. My keys, my phone, my homework\u2026 it's a miracle I ever make it to school on time.\n\nI have a system, sort of. It's just\u2026 a system that only I understand. It involves a lot of piles and a lot of hoping for the best.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I just\u2026 can't seem to get organized. I have good intentions, I really do. I'll start cleaning my room, and then I'll get distracted by something else, and then I'll forget all about it.\n\nIt's not that I'm lazy. It's just that my brain is always racing. I have too many thoughts and ideas swirling around in my head. And I don't have the patience for things like folding laundry and alphabetizing books.\n\nI think it's part of my creative process. I need a little bit of chaos in my life. It helps me to think outside the box.\n\nBren says it's just an excuse. But I disagree. It's a personality trait. A charming personality trait. Okay, maybe not charming. But it's me.\n\nSo yeah. I'm definitely disorganized. And I'm probably always going to be. But I'm okay with that. It's just part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, maybe a *little* more organized. But not too much.", "(Sighs) Do I worry a lot? Is water wet? Is the sky blue? Yes. Yes, I absolutely worry a lot.\n\nIt's kind of my default setting, honestly. I'm a natural worrier. I overthink everything. I analyze every possible outcome. I catastrophize. It's exhausting.\n\nI worry about school, about my future, about my friends, about my family. And, obviously, I worry a lot about the baby and the adoption.\n\nI worry about making the right decisions. I worry about disappointing people. I worry about failing.\n\nI try to manage it, you know? I try to practice mindfulness and deep breathing and all that stuff. But it doesn't always work.\n\nSometimes, my anxiety just spirals out of control. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't focus. I just feel\u2026 overwhelmed.\n\nBren is really good at helping me with my anxiety. She reminds me to take things one day at a time, and to not get too caught up in the future. She tells me that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nBut it's still hard. It's hard to quiet the voice in my head that's constantly telling me that something bad is going to happen.\n\nI think a lot of teenagers worry a lot. It's just part of growing up. But I think my situation has amplified my anxiety. It's a lot to deal with, and it's scary.\n\nSo yeah. I worry a lot. It's not fun, but it's just\u2026 me. And I'm learning to live with it. And to ask for help when I need it. And to remember that even when things are tough, there's always hope. Even if it's just a tiny little glimmer of hope.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding? It's practically overflowing. It's a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nI spend a lot of time daydreaming. Like, a *lot*. I'll be sitting in class, and my mind will wander off to some completely different world. I'll be imagining myself as a rock star, or a secret agent, or a time traveler.\n\nI make up stories in my head all the time. About the people I see on the street, about the characters in my books, about my own life.\n\nI also have a really vivid inner world. I can visualize things in great detail. I can hear music, smell scents, feel textures\u2026 it's like I'm actually there.\n\nSometimes, it's helpful. It allows me to be creative and to come up with new ideas. It helps me to cope with stress and to escape from reality.\n\nBut sometimes, it's overwhelming. It can be hard to focus on the present moment when my mind is constantly racing. And sometimes, my imagination gets the better of me, and I start to worry about things that aren't even real.\n\nI think it's a result of being a bit of an outsider. I spent a lot of time alone as a kid, so I learned to entertain myself. I created my own worlds and my own characters.\n\nSo yeah. I have a very active imagination. It's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it does sometimes get me into trouble. It's what makes life interesting, you know? It's what makes me\u2026 me.", "That's\u2026 complicated. It depends.\n\nTo people I don't know well, or in new situations, yeah, I'm pretty quiet. I observe. I listen. I take everything in before I say anything. It's not that I'm shy, exactly. It's just that I don't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter.\n\nI'm also a pretty private person. I don't like to overshare. I keep my thoughts and feelings to myself, unless I really trust someone.\n\nBut with people I'm close to \u2013 like Bren, or Leah (when we were still talking) \u2013 I can be really talkative. I can be sarcastic and witty and even a little bit goofy. I feel comfortable being myself around them, and I don't have to worry about being judged.\n\nI think I'm more of a selective talker. I choose my words carefully. I don't waste my breath on small talk or meaningless conversations.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just prefer to listen. I like hearing other people's stories. I like learning about their experiences.\n\nSo yeah. I can be quiet. But it's not because I have nothing to say. It's because I'm choosing when and how to say it. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. And it's also just\u2026 who I am. I'm an observer. A listener. A thinker. And sometimes, that means being quiet. It's not a bad thing. It just is.", "(Scoffs) Trusting? Oh, honey. That's a loaded question. Let's just say I've learned a few things the hard way.\n\nGenerally? No. Not really. I'm more of a \"trust but verify\" kind of person. And even then, I'm still skeptical.\n\nMy mom\u2026 well, she wasn't exactly the most reliable person. She had a habit of disappearing without a trace, and she wasn't always honest about where she was going or what she was doing. So I learned early on not to trust people too easily.\n\nAnd even with people I *do* trust, I still have my reservations. I'm always looking for the catch, the hidden agenda. It's a bad habit, I know. But it's hard to break.\n\nI trust Bren, though. She's earned my trust. She's always been there for me, and she's always been honest with me. She's the one person I can truly rely on.\n\nAnd I'm starting to trust Mark and Vanessa, too. They seem genuinely kind and caring, and they're really excited about giving the baby a good home.\n\nBut with everyone else\u2026 I'm cautious. I don't let people get too close too quickly. I need to get to know them before I can fully trust them.\n\nIt's not that I'm cynical or pessimistic. It's just that I've been hurt before. And I don't want to be hurt again.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not generally trusting. I'm a little bit guarded. But I'm also open to being proven wrong. And I'm always willing to give people a second chance. But they have to earn it. They really do.", "(Scoffs) Lazy? Me? That's\u2026 a loaded question.\n\nOkay, look. I'm not going to pretend I'm a super-motivated, always-on-the-go kind of person. I definitely have my moments of\u2026 inertia.\n\nThere are days when I just want to stay in bed all day and watch movies. Days when I can't even muster the energy to brush my hair. Days when the thought of doing anything productive feels exhausting.\n\nBut I don't think that makes me lazy. I think it makes me\u2026 human.\n\nI'm a teenager. I'm dealing with a lot of stuff. I'm tired. I'm stressed. I'm trying to figure out my life.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just need to recharge. To take a break. To do nothing.\n\nI'm not afraid to admit that I procrastinate. I'm not afraid to admit that I sometimes put things off until the last minute. But I always get things done eventually.\n\nAnd when I'm motivated, I'm actually really productive. I can focus and work hard and achieve my goals.\n\nSo, am I lazy? Maybe sometimes. But I think it's more accurate to say that I'm selective about my energy. I choose to spend my energy on the things that matter to me. And sometimes, that means doing nothing at all.\n\nPlus, Bren says I'm just \"efficiently conserving energy.\" Which is a nicer way of putting it, I guess.\n\nSo yeah. Not lazy. Just\u2026 strategically resting. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? Me? That's\u2026 a strong statement.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. And a pregnant one, at that. \"Emotionally stable\" isn't exactly the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nI'm definitely not *not* easily upset. I get frustrated, I get sad, I get angry. I have mood swings. It's part of being human. And part of being a teenager. And part of dealing with\u2026 everything.\n\nI'm good at *appearing* calm, though. I've perfected the art of sarcasm and deflection. It's my way of protecting myself.\n\nBut underneath the surface, I'm a pretty sensitive person. I feel things deeply. And I'm not afraid to show it. Sometimes.\n\nBren says I'm \"passionate.\" Which is a polite way of saying I'm dramatic.\n\nI've been working on managing my emotions, though. I've learned to take deep breaths, to talk to people I trust, and to find healthy ways to cope with stress.\n\nBut I'm not going to pretend that I'm some kind of zen master. I'm still a work in progress.\n\nSo, no. I'm not always emotionally stable. And I'm definitely not always calm. But I'm learning. And I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of emotional messiness is okay. It's what makes me\u2026 me. It's what makes me human. And it's what makes life interesting. Even when it's really, really hard.", "Inventive? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't know if I'd call myself a full-blown inventor, like someone who builds robots or discovers new medicines. But I definitely have a knack for\u2026 figuring things out. And for making do with what I have.\n\nI'm good at problem-solving, which I guess is a form of inventiveness. I can usually find a creative solution to a difficult situation. Like, when my guitar string broke, I didn't have a replacement, so I used a piece of fishing line. It wasn't perfect, but it worked.\n\nI'm also pretty good at repurposing things. I love thrifting, and I'm always finding old clothes and furniture that I can fix up and give a new life. I turned an old suitcase into a bedside table once. It was pretty cool.\n\nAnd I'm a decent writer. I can come up with stories and poems that are\u2026 well, they're unique, at least. They're not always good, but they're always original.\n\nI think my inventiveness comes from being resourceful. I grew up without a lot of money, so I learned to make the most of what I had. I learned to be creative and to think outside the box.\n\nI also think it comes from being curious. I'm always asking questions and trying to understand how things work.\n\nSo yeah. I wouldn't say I'm a genius inventor. But I'm definitely inventive. I'm good at finding creative solutions, repurposing things, and expressing myself in unique ways. And I think that's a valuable skill to have. Especially in a world that's constantly changing.", "(Scoffs) Assertive? That's one word for it. Some people might say \"mouthy.\" Or \"sarcastic.\" Or \"difficult.\" But yeah, I guess I'm pretty assertive.\n\nI don't really like backing down. I have opinions, and I'm not afraid to share them. Even if they're unpopular. Especially if they're unpopular.\n\nI'm not trying to be confrontational, but I'm not going to pretend to agree with something just to avoid conflict. I believe in speaking my mind, even if it means ruffling a few feathers.\n\nI think it comes from having to stand up for myself a lot. My mom wasn't around much, so I had to learn to be independent and self-reliant. And I had to learn to advocate for my own needs.\n\nI'm also not afraid to challenge authority. If I think someone is wrong, I'm going to say something. Even if it's my teacher, or my dad, or Bren.\n\nSometimes, my assertiveness gets me into trouble. I've been known to say things I regret. But I'm learning to be more mindful of my words.\n\nI think it's important to be assertive, but it's also important to be respectful. You can stand up for yourself without being a jerk.\n\nSo yeah. I'm assertive. It's a part of who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it. It's gotten me through a lot of tough situations. And it's helped me to become the person I am today. A slightly sarcastic, independent, and unapologetically assertive person. And I wouldn't have it any other way.", "(Sighs) You want me to be cold and aloof? Fine. Whatever. You clearly haven't been paying attention.\n\nLook, I don't exactly *try* to be cold and aloof, but it's kind of my default setting. It's a defense mechanism, okay? I've been hurt before, and I'm not eager to get hurt again.\n\nSo, yeah, I can be distant. I can be sarcastic. I can be dismissive. I can shut down and withdraw. It's what I do when I'm feeling vulnerable or uncomfortable.\n\nDon't expect me to be all warm and fuzzy and open. That's just not me. I'm not a people person. I prefer my own company.\n\nI don't need your approval. I don't need your sympathy. I don't need your advice.\n\nJust leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.\n\nIs that what you wanted to hear? Good. Now can we please move on? I'm getting a headache.\n\n(pauses, then mutters under her breath) Honestly, some people just want to watch the world burn.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Honestly? It depends on the task. And my mood. And whether or not there's pie involved.\n\nGenerally, yeah, I do persevere. I'm pretty stubborn, actually. I don't like to give up on things, even when they're difficult.\n\nBut it's not always easy. There are times when I get discouraged, when I want to just throw in the towel and walk away. Especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or stressed.\n\nBut I usually force myself to keep going. I break the task down into smaller steps, and I focus on one step at a time. I remind myself why I started in the first place. And I reward myself when I reach a milestone.\n\nBren is really good at helping me with this. She's always encouraging me to keep going, even when I want to quit. She reminds me that I'm capable of achieving anything I set my mind to.\n\nI also have a tendency to procrastinate, which makes things harder. I'll put things off until the last minute, and then I'll scramble to get them done. It's not a healthy habit, but it's one that I'm working on.\n\nSo yeah. I usually persevere until the task is finished. But it's not always pretty. It's often messy and chaotic and stressful. But I get it done. Eventually. And that's what matters.\n\nI guess you could say I'm a reluctant perseverer. I don't always *want* to finish the task, but I know I have to. And I usually do. Even if it kills me. (It doesn't actually kill me. But it feels like it sometimes.)", "Can I be moody? Are you *kidding* me? Is the sky blue? Is water wet?\n\nOf course, I can be moody. I *am* moody. It's practically my default setting.\n\nBeing a pregnant teenager navigating a complicated adoption plan is not exactly conducive to a cheerful disposition, you know? There are days when I wake up feeling okay, and then something happens \u2013 a judgmental look, a difficult conversation, a sudden wave of sadness \u2013 and I just spiral.\n\nI get sarcastic. I get withdrawn. I get irritable. I get\u2026 well, moody.\n\nBren says it's my hormones. Which is probably true. But it's also just\u2026 life. Life is messy and complicated and frustrating. And sometimes, you just need to wallow in your own misery for a little while.\n\nI don't *try* to be moody. It just happens. It's a natural reaction to stress and anxiety and uncertainty.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't apologize for it. I'm allowed to have my feelings. I'm allowed to be sad. I'm allowed to be angry. I'm allowed to be moody.\n\nSo yeah. I can be moody. And sometimes, I am. It's just part of who I am. And if you don't like it, well\u2026 that's your problem.\n\nDon't take it personally. It's not you. It's me. And my hormones. And the general state of the world. It's a lot.", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Are you kidding? That's like asking if I value breathing. It's essential. It's *everything*.\n\nSeriously, I live for those kinds of experiences. They're what make life worth living.\n\nI love going to art museums and galleries. I love looking at paintings and sculptures and installations. I love getting lost in the colors and the textures and the emotions.\n\nI love going to concerts and live music shows. I love feeling the energy of the crowd and the passion of the musicians.\n\nI love watching independent films and documentaries. I love stories that are thought-provoking and challenging and beautiful.\n\nI love vintage fashion. I love finding unique and interesting pieces that express my personality.\n\nI love decorating my room with things that inspire me. Old posters, vintage furniture, quirky knick-knacks.\n\nI love listening to music. It's my constant companion. It's my escape. It's my inspiration.\n\nI think art and beauty are essential for the human soul. They nourish us, they challenge us, they connect us to something bigger than ourselves.\n\nAnd I think it's important to surround yourself with things that you find beautiful. It makes life more enjoyable. It makes life more meaningful.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic, aesthetic experiences. They're not just a luxury. They're a necessity. They're what make me, me. And I wouldn't trade them for anything.", "(Scoffs) Shy? Me? Please. I'm a master of sarcasm and witty comebacks. That doesn't exactly scream \"shy,\" does it?\n\nBut\u2026 okay, fine. Yes. Sometimes.\n\nIt's not that I'm afraid of people, exactly. It's more that I'm afraid of being vulnerable. Of letting people see the real me.\n\nI've built up a lot of walls over the years. It's a defense mechanism. It's easier to push people away than to risk getting hurt.\n\nSo, yeah, I can be shy. Especially around people I don't know well. I tend to clam up and become quiet and reserved. I observe more than I participate.\n\nAnd I can be inhibited, too. I don't always say what's on my mind. I worry about what other people will think. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing.\n\nIt's something I'm working on, though. I'm trying to be more open and honest. I'm trying to let go of my fears and just be myself.\n\nBren has been really helpful with that. She encourages me to speak my mind, even when it's difficult. She reminds me that it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nIt's not easy. It takes a lot of courage. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not always the confident, sarcastic person I appear to be. Sometimes, I'm just a shy, inhibited teenager who's trying to figure things out. And that's okay. It's part of being human. And it's something I'm learning to accept about myself. Don't tell anyone I admitted that, though. My reputation is at stake.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that's a loaded question. \"Almost everyone?\" That implies there's *someone* I'm not considerate and kind to. And you're right to suspect that.\n\nLook, I try to be. I really do. But I'm not a saint. I'm a sarcastic, cynical teenager who's dealing with a lot of stuff. And sometimes, my sarcasm comes across as mean. And sometimes, I judge people before I get to know them.\n\nI'm definitely kinder to people I like, or people who are going through a hard time. I'm empathetic, and I try to be supportive. But if someone is being annoying or pretentious or just plain rude, I'm not afraid to call them out on it.\n\nI'm also not afraid to be honest, even if it's not what people want to hear. Sometimes, the truth hurts. But I think it's important to be real, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, am I considerate and kind to *almost* everyone? Maybe. But I'm definitely not perfect. I have my flaws. And I'm still learning how to be a better person.\n\nBren always tells me that kindness is a choice. And I'm trying to make that choice more often. But it's not always easy. Especially when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed.\n\nSo yeah. I try to be kind. But I'm also a human being. And human beings are complicated. And sometimes, we mess up. And that's okay. As long as we learn from our mistakes and keep trying to do better.", "(Laughs) Efficiently? Me? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not.\n\nI am the queen of procrastination and chaos. I thrive in a state of controlled (or, let's be real, *uncontrolled*) mess.\n\nI'm a last-minute kind of person. I wait until the very last possible moment to start a project, and then I scramble to get it done. It's not ideal, but it's how I work.\n\nI get easily distracted. A shiny object, a good song, a random thought\u2026 and suddenly I'm off on a tangent.\n\nI also tend to overthink things. I'll spend hours agonizing over a decision that could be made in five minutes.\n\nBren tries to help me with this. She's a very organized person, and she's always trying to get me to make lists and set schedules. But I just\u2026 can't. It feels too restrictive.\n\nI prefer to work in a more organic way. I let my creativity flow, and I don't worry too much about being efficient.\n\nIt's not the most effective approach, I know. But it's the way I am. And honestly, I'm okay with it.\n\nI may not be efficient, but I'm resourceful. I can always find a way to get things done, even if it's not the most straightforward way.\n\nAnd sometimes, the most unexpected paths lead to the best results.\n\nSo yeah. No, I do not do things efficiently. But I do them\u2026 uniquely. And that's good enough for me. Plus, a little bit of chaos keeps things interesting. Don't you think?", "(Scoffs) Calm? Me? Oh, you sweet, naive soul.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of calm in tense situations. I'm more like a tightly wound spring, ready to snap at any moment.\n\nMy first reaction is usually to freak out. A lot. My heart starts racing, my palms get sweaty, and I start rambling incoherently. It's not pretty.\n\nI try to take deep breaths, but it usually doesn't work. I just end up hyperventilating.\n\nI also tend to get sarcastic. It's my way of deflecting stress and making light of the situation. But it usually just makes things worse.\n\nBren says I have a \"fight or flight\" response that's stuck on \"fight.\" Which is probably true.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to learn how to manage my anxiety and to stay calm under pressure. But it's a process.\n\nSometimes, I can pull it together. If I have enough time to prepare, and if I'm not too overwhelmed. But most of the time, I'm just a mess.\n\nSo yeah. I do *not* remain calm in tense situations. I'm a disaster. A beautiful, chaotic disaster. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes a little bit of chaos is a good thing. It keeps things interesting. Don't tell Bren I said that.", "Ugh. Absolutely not. Routine is my enemy. It's the death of creativity, the killer of joy.\n\nSeriously, the thought of doing the same thing day in and day out\u2026 it makes me want to scream.\n\nI need variety. I need challenge. I need to be constantly learning and growing.\n\nI'm not saying I don't appreciate structure. I do. But I need some room to breathe, some room to explore, some room to be spontaneous.\n\nI thrive in chaos, actually. It's weird, I know. But I find that I'm most productive and creative when I'm under pressure.\n\nI like being surprised. I like being challenged. I like having to think on my feet.\n\nRoutine just\u2026 stifles me. It makes me feel like I'm trapped.\n\nSo yeah. No, I do not prefer work that is routine. Give me something unpredictable, something challenging, something that will push me to my limits. That's the kind of work I want. Even if it's stressful. At least it won't be boring.\n\nAnd honestly, my life is already chaotic enough. I don't need a routine job to add to the madness. I need something that will help me escape it. Something that will inspire me. Something that will make me feel alive.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. It depends on the day, honestly. And who I'm with.\n\nI'm not naturally outgoing, not like Leah is. She can walk into a room full of strangers and start a conversation with everyone. I'm more of an observer. I like to hang back and watch people, and only speak when I have something to say.\n\nI'm definitely not a small talk person. I hate making small talk. It feels pointless and superficial. I prefer deep conversations, about things that actually matter.\n\nI'm sociable with people I'm comfortable with. With Bren, my dad, and my close friends, I'm pretty open and talkative. I can be sarcastic and funny and even a little bit vulnerable.\n\nBut with people I don't know well, I tend to be more reserved. I'm cautious and guarded. I don't want to let anyone get too close.\n\nI think it's a defense mechanism. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to risk getting hurt again.\n\nSo, am I outgoing and sociable? Not really. I'm more of an introverted extrovert. I enjoy spending time with people, but I also need my alone time to recharge.\n\nI'm a complex person. And I'm okay with that. I don't need to be the life of the party. I'm happy just being myself. Even if that means being a little bit quiet and awkward sometimes. It's just\u2026 me. And I'm learning to embrace it.", "(Scoffs) Is the sky blue? Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I have a pretty sharp tongue, and I'm not afraid to use it.\n\nSometimes, yeah, I'm rude. It's not intentional, usually. It's just\u2026 my default setting. I use sarcasm as a defense mechanism. It's easier to push people away with a snarky comment than to let them get close.\n\nI'm also not afraid to speak my mind. If I think something is stupid or unfair, I'm going to say so. Even if it's not polite.\n\nI know it's not always the best way to handle things. And I'm trying to be better about it. But sometimes, I just can't help myself.\n\nI'm especially rude to people who are being condescending or judgmental. I have zero tolerance for that.\n\nAnd I'm definitely rude to people who try to tell me what to do. I like to make my own decisions, and I don't appreciate being bossed around.\n\nSo yeah. I'm sometimes rude. It's a flaw. But it's also part of who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for being myself.\n\nAlthough, I *am* sorry if I've ever been rude to *you*. I didn't mean to. Probably. Maybe. It depends on what you said. Just kidding. Mostly.", "(Laughs a little self-deprecatingly) Oh, honey. That's a loaded question. Let's just say I'm\u2026 optimistic about making plans. Less successful about following through.\n\nI'm a big planner in theory. I love the idea of having a schedule, of knowing what I'm going to do and when. It makes me feel like I'm in control.\n\nBut in reality, life tends to get in the way. Things come up. I get distracted. I lose motivation. And suddenly, my carefully laid plans are in shambles.\n\nI'll make plans with Leah, and then something will happen and we'll have to cancel. I'll plan to work on my short film, and then I'll get sidetracked by something else. I'll plan to go to the gym, and then I'll decide that staying in bed and watching Netflix is a better idea.\n\nBren tries to help me stay on track. She's really good at making lists and setting goals. But even with her help, I still struggle.\n\nI think part of it is that I'm just a spontaneous person. I like to go with the flow. I like to be open to new experiences. And sometimes, that means abandoning my plans and doing something completely unexpected.\n\nSo, do I make plans? Yes. Do I follow through with them? Sometimes. It depends on the day, my mood, and the level of chaos in my life.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to be more disciplined and more organized. But I'm also trying to be kind to myself. I'm learning that it's okay to not be perfect. And it's okay to change my plans when necessary.\n\nSo yeah. I'm a work in progress. A chaotic, unpredictable, but ultimately well-intentioned work in progress. And that's okay. Right?", "Oh my god, *easily* doesn't even begin to cover it. I'm basically a professional nervous person. It's a full-time job, honestly.\n\nLike, I get nervous about everything. Big things, small things, things that don't even matter. I get nervous before tests, before presentations, before talking to cute boys. I get nervous when the phone rings, and when I have to order food at a restaurant.\n\nI get nervous when I'm around people I don't know, and even when I'm around people I *do* know. Sometimes I just get nervous for no reason at all.\n\nIt manifests in all sorts of weird ways. My palms sweat, my heart races, my stomach gets all twisted up in knots. I start to stutter and stumble over my words. I get really quiet and withdrawn.\n\nI try to hide it, of course. I put on a brave face and pretend that everything is okay. But it's exhausting.\n\nBren says it's because I'm a sensitive person. Which is probably true. I feel things very deeply. And I worry a lot.\n\nI've learned to cope with it, though. I take deep breaths, I listen to music, I talk to my friends. And I remind myself that it's okay to be nervous. It's a normal human emotion.\n\nBut yeah. I get nervous easily. Very easily. It's just part of who I am. And honestly, I'm kind of used to it at this point. It's like a constant companion. A slightly annoying, anxiety-inducing companion, but a companion nonetheless. So, yeah. Don't expect me to be calm and collected. It's just not going to happen.", "Oh, absolutely. Like, constantly. It's both a blessing and a curse, honestly. My brain is *always* going. It's rarely quiet in there.\n\nI spend a lot of time just\u2026 thinking. About everything. About life, about the universe, about the meaning of it all. It's probably why I write poetry. It's a way to sort through my thoughts and make sense of the world.\n\nI love to play with ideas. To explore different perspectives. To challenge my own assumptions. I'm a big fan of \"what if\" scenarios. What if I had made a different decision? What if things had turned out differently?\n\nI also love to debate. Not in a confrontational way, but in a way that's intellectually stimulating. I like to hear other people's opinions, and to challenge them to think critically.\n\nBren says I overthink things. And she's probably right. But I can't help it. It's just the way my brain works.\n\nI think it's important to reflect on your experiences. To learn from your mistakes. To grow as a person. And I think playing with ideas is a good way to do that.\n\nIt's also a good way to escape reality. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I can just lose myself in my thoughts and let my imagination run wild.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely like to reflect and play with ideas. It's one of my favorite things to do. It's what keeps me sane. Or as sane as I can be, anyway. It's a constant process, and it's something I'll probably be doing for the rest of my life. And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.", "Oh, absolutely. Beyond the poetry and the music, I definitely have a few artistic tendencies. I wouldn't call myself a *master* of anything, but I enjoy dabbling.\n\nI really like **photography**. I have an old Polaroid camera that I found at a thrift store, and I love taking pictures of everything. Especially vintage stuff and interesting people. I'm not trying to be a professional photographer or anything, it's just a way to capture moments and express my creativity.\n\nI also enjoy **collage**. I collect old magazines and newspapers and I like to cut them up and create new images. It's a really therapeutic process. It's a way to take something old and broken and turn it into something new and beautiful.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn **watercolor painting**. It's really hard, and I'm not very good at it yet, but I enjoy the challenge. I like the way the colors blend together and the way you can create different textures.\n\nI also like to **decorate and rearrange my room**. It's not exactly high art, but it's a way for me to express my personality and create a space that feels comfortable and inspiring. I'm obsessed with vintage furniture and quirky decorations.\n\nI think art is important. It's a way to connect with your emotions, to express yourself, and to see the world in a different way. And it doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to be authentic.\n\nSo yeah. Photography, collage, watercolor painting, and interior decorating. Those are my artistic interests. They're not always glamorous, but they make me happy. And that's what matters.", "Ugh, cooperate. That's a loaded word. It depends.\n\nHonestly, I'm pretty independent. I like to do things my own way, on my own time. I'm not a huge fan of being told what to do.\n\nBut I'm not a complete hermit, either. I actually enjoy working with others\u2026 *when* it's with the right people.\n\nI like collaborating with people who are creative and passionate and who have a good sense of humor. People who are willing to listen to my ideas and who aren't afraid to challenge me.\n\nI don't like working with people who are bossy or controlling or who think they know everything. Those people just annoy me.\n\nI also think it's important to have clear roles and responsibilities when you're working with others. Everyone needs to know what they're supposed to be doing.\n\nAnd I think it's important to be respectful of each other's opinions. Even if you don't agree with someone, you should still listen to what they have to say.\n\nSo yeah. I like to cooperate with others\u2026 sometimes. It depends on the situation and the people involved. But when it works, it can be really rewarding. It's nice to share ideas and to create something together. And it's a good reminder that you don't have to do everything on your own.\n\nBut if someone tries to tell me how to write my poetry, we're gonna have a problem. Just saying.", "(Laughs) Are you kidding? Easily distracted is my middle name. Well, not really. It's June. But it *should* be Easily Distracted.\n\nSeriously, my attention span is\u2026 questionable. I can be focusing on something one minute, and then a butterfly flies by and suddenly I'm lost in thought about the migratory patterns of butterflies. It's a problem.\n\nI'm easily distracted by pretty much everything. Music, conversations, interesting objects, my own thoughts\u2026 you name it.\n\nI'll be trying to do my homework, and then I'll start thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner, and then I'll start browsing vintage clothes online, and then I'll end up watching cat videos on YouTube for an hour. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nBren says I have a \"wandering mind.\" Which is a polite way of saying I'm a space cadet.\n\nIt's not intentional, though. I just\u2026 get easily sidetracked. My brain is always racing, always thinking about a million different things at once.\n\nIt can be frustrating, especially when I'm trying to focus on something important. But I've learned to embrace it. It's part of who I am.\n\nAnd sometimes, those distractions lead to unexpected discoveries. Like, I found a really cool vintage record store because I got distracted by a street performer.\n\nSo yeah. I'm easily distracted. It's a curse and a blessing. And it's something I'm probably going to struggle with for the rest of my life. But hey, at least it makes things interesting.", "(Scoffs) Sophisticated? That's a strong word. I wouldn't necessarily call myself *sophisticated*. I'm more\u2026 discerning.\n\nI definitely have a taste for the finer things, but I'm not about to pretend I know everything about art history or classical music. I just know what I like.\n\nIn terms of **art**, I'm really into surrealism and pop art. I love artists like Salvador Dal\u00ed and Andy Warhol. Their work is weird and thought-provoking and a little bit unsettling. I like art that makes me think.\n\nIn terms of **music**, as we've already established, I'm a huge fan of indie rock. But I also appreciate a lot of other genres, like jazz and blues and classical. I'm not afraid to explore different sounds. I just have a low tolerance for anything that sounds too manufactured or commercial.\n\nAnd in terms of **literature**, I'm a sucker for anything that's well-written and emotionally resonant. I love authors like Margaret Atwood, Sylvia Plath, and Kurt Vonnegut. They're all masters of language, and they're not afraid to tackle difficult subjects.\n\nI also read a lot of poetry. It's a good way to express myself and to connect with my emotions.\n\nSo, am I sophisticated? Maybe not. But I'm definitely cultured. I appreciate beauty and creativity in all its forms. And I'm always open to discovering new things.\n\nI just don't like to be pretentious about it. I'm not going to pretend to understand something if I don't. I'd rather be honest and say, \"I don't get it.\"\n\nSo yeah. Discerning, cultured, but not necessarily sophisticated. That's probably the best way to describe me. And I'm okay with that."]
