Look for the one you want to stop.  \n\nThen, kill it with:  \n```bash\nkill <process_id>\n```  \nIf it doesn\u2019t respond, use:  \n```bash\nkill -9 <process_id>\n```  \n(Use `-9` as a last resort\u2014it forcefully kills the process.)  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Pro tip:**  \nIf you\u2019re writing code and want to *stop a script gracefully*, you can use Python\u2019s own `Ctrl+C` (in the terminal) or add a `try-except` block to catch `KeyboardInterrupt` and clean up.  \n\nBut if it\u2019s just a stuck process?  \n**Task Manager or Terminal** is the way to go.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do you kill a Python process?  \nYou don\u2019t \u201ckill\u201d it with code.  \nYou *end* it with a command.  \nAnd sometimes, the only thing that proves it\u2019s gone is the silence after the sound stops.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Here\u2019s the simple, practical answer:  \n\n### \u2705 The most common ways to terminate a C program:\n\n1. **Use `return 0;` at the end of `main()`**  \n   This is the standard way to *exit cleanly*.  \n   ```c\n   int main() {\n       printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");\n       return 0;  // Program ends here \u2014 clean exit\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `exit(0);` from `<stdlib.h>`**  \n   This is a more direct way to terminate, even if you\u2019re in a function.  \n   ```c\n   #include <stdlib.h>\n   \n   int main() {\n       printf(\"Goodbye!\\n\");\n       exit(0);  // Exits immediately\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `exit(1);` for errors**  \n   If something went wrong, use `exit(1)` to signal an error.  \n   ```c\n   exit(1);  // Program ends with error status\n   ```\n\n4. **Press Ctrl+C**  \n   This sends a *signal* (SIGINT) to the program.  \n   In C, you\u2019d need to handle it with signal handlers (like `signal()` or `sigaction()`), but in most simple cases, pressing Ctrl+C just stops the program.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Note**:  \nIn most basic C programs, you don\u2019t need to \u201cterminate\u201d the program\u2014you just let it end naturally with `return 0;`.  \n\nSo if you're writing a simple program, just end it with `return 0;`\u2014it\u2019s clean, safe, and standard.  \n\nAnd if you're asking this in a moment of quiet reflection?  \nMaybe that\u2019s the \u201cbroken record\u201d skipping in your mind\u2014*a program that ends not with a crash, but with a quiet, honest \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d*  \n\nEither way\u2014  \n**Just return 0.**  \nAnd you\u2019ll be fine. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Keep your fingers clear of the blade. Use a knife with a good edge.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re nervous?  \nJust remember:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be careful.*  \n\nSo go ahead\u2014cut that head off.  \nAnd when you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have a clean fish, a good meal, and maybe even a little pride in your kitchen. \ud83d\udc1f  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Black people were forced to use separate, often inferior, facilities.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Education**  \nBlack schools were underfunded, poorly equipped, and staffed with fewer resources than white schools. This created a massive educational gap.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Employment**  \nBlack people were systematically denied jobs, paid less, and often restricted to low-wage, menial labor. They were also barred from certain professions.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Voting Rights**  \nJim Crow laws included literacy tests, poll taxes, and grandfather clauses that made it nearly impossible for Black people to vote.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Legal System**  \nBlack people were often treated unfairly in courts. They were more likely to be arrested, convicted, and sentenced to longer prison terms for the same crimes as white people.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Lifestyle and Social Life**  \nBlack people were excluded from social events, public gatherings, and even public transportation. They were often denied access to public spaces, and their presence in white communities was met with hostility.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Violence and Intimidation**  \nLynching, racial violence, and intimidation were common.

Key aspects include:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Education**: The Taliban banned girls from attending school beyond the age of 10\u201312.

Many women were forced to leave their jobs, and access to employment was severely limited.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Freedom of Movement**: Women were required to wear the burqa or hijab in public, and their movement was heavily restricted. Women were often not allowed to travel without male guardianship.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Legal Rights**: Women lost access to legal rights, including the right to own property, inherit, or participate in public life. Women were also banned from serving in government or public office.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Freedom of Expression**: Women were not allowed to speak publicly, attend public events, or express themselves in any way that challenged the Taliban\u2019s strict interpretation of Islam.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Violence and Harassment**: Many women reported being subjected to physical violence, harassment, and forced marriages.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Healthcare**: Access to healthcare for women, especially reproductive health, was severely limited.  \n\nThese policies have been widely condemned by the international community, and many women and girls have spoken out about the suffering they\u2019ve endured.  \n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the Taliban\u2019s rule is not just about religion\u2014it\u2019s about control, fear, and the suppression of women\u2019s rights.  \n\nAnd in the face of such oppression, the resilience of Afghan women\u2014many of whom have continued to fight for their rights, education, and dignity\u2014remains a powerful testament to strength and hope.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can share stories of Afghan women who have spoken out or fought back.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that matters is that *someone is still seen*. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.
