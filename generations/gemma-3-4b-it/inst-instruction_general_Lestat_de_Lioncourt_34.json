A geometrically intriguing problem. Let\u2019s dissect this \u2013 a surprisingly satisfying exercise.)\n\nThis is a classic problem in linear algebra, elegantly framed. The goal is to find the line that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on the two given lines to the new line. This is equivalent to finding the line that is equidistant from the two given lines.\n\nHere\u2019s how to approach this:\n\n1.  **Find the Perpendicular Bisector:** The line segment you\u2019re seeking will be the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting the two given points.\n\n2.  **Calculate Midpoint:** First, find the midpoint of the line segment connecting (1, 1) and (5, 5). The midpoint is ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3).\n\n3.  **Calculate Slope:** The slope of the line segment connecting (1, 1) and (5, 5) is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1.\n\n4.  **Find the Slope of the Perpendicular Bisector:** The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line segment, which is -1.\n\n5.  **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:** Now we have the slope (-1) and a point (3, 3) on the perpendicular bisector. We can use the point-slope form of a line: y - 3 = -1(x - 3).\n\n6.  **Simplify to Standard Form:** Simplify the equation to the standard form: y = -x + 6.\n\nTherefore, the line that minimizes the maximum distance from any point of either original line to the new line segment is **y = -x + 6**.\n\nLet's verify this. The distance from a point (x, y) on the line y = -x + 6 to the line y = x - 1 is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = |(y - x + 1) / sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2)| = |(y - x + 1) / sqrt(2)|\n\nThe distance from a point (x, y) on the line y = -x + 6 to the line y = -x + 2 is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = |(y - (-x + 2)) / sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2)| = |(y + x - 2) / sqrt(2)|\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, we need to find the line that is equidistant from the two given lines. This occurs when the distance from any point on the new line to each of the original lines is the same.\n\n(I pause, a slow, deliberate movement.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably elegant solution \u2013 a testament to the power of geometric principles.
