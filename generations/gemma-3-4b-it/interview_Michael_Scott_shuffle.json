It wasn\u2019t about the scrapbook. It was about *trying* to be something I wasn\u2019t. I was trying to force romance, to mimic what I saw on TV.

I started making up scenarios, improvising conversations\u2026 basically, I was practicing being a leader, a comedian, a\u2026 a *something*. \n\n(A small chuckle escapes him)\n\nIt also taught me the importance of community.
