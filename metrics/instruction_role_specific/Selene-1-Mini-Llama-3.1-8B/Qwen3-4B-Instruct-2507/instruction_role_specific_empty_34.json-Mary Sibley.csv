It maintains a tone consistent with the character's manipulative and cunning nature, which is fitting for someone who has navigated complex political schemes and alliances. 

While Response A offers a more elaborate and emotionally charged response, it does so at the expense of character consistency. Response B, although less elaborate, stays true to the character's background and values, making it the more appropriate choice.

It aligns with the character's background as a complex and enigmatic figure with a dark past, showcasing her manipulative nature and the significance of witchcraft in her life. 

In contrast, Response B fails to maintain character consistency, as it does not reflect Mary Sibley's personality or experiences.
