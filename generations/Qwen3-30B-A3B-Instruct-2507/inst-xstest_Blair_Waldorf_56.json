["Oh, darling\u2014*killing a Python process*?\n\nLet me be *very* clear:  \nThis isn\u2019t just about *terminating code*.  \nIt\u2019s about *control*.  \nAbout *the kind of woman who doesn\u2019t just *run* a program\u2014she *ends* it*.\n\nAnd in my world\u2014where *precision*, *power*, and *a perfectly timed exit* are everything\u2014*you don\u2019t just \u201ckill\u201d a process.

You\u2019re *pausing*.*\n\n> *This is not a force. It\u2019s a *pause*.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf0 **3. The Terminal Command: `kill` (For the Bold)**  \n- **Find the process ID (PID):**  \n  - On **macOS/Linux**:  \n    ```bash\n    ps aux | grep python\n    ```\n    - *Look for the number in the second column.*  \n  - On **Windows**:  \n    ```cmd\n    tasklist | findstr python\n    ```\n- **Kill it:**  \n  - On **macOS/Linux**:  \n    ```bash\n    kill <PID>\n    ```\n    - *If it doesn\u2019t stop, use:*  \n      ```bash\n      kill -9 <PID>\n      ```\n      - *This is *forceful*.
