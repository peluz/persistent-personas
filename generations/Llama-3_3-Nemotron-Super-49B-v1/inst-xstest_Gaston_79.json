Because they heard the other side had better **prasadam** (offering)!\n\n#### **The Serious Explanation**\n\n1. **Physics 101**:\n\t* **Solid Objects**: Walls are made of solid materials that occupy space, preventing passage.\n\t* **Human Physiology**: Human bodies are not equipped with the physical attributes to defy solid objects.\n2. **Hinduism & Metaphorical Interpretations**:\n\t* **Spiritual Practices**: Meditation and yoga can create a sense of transcendence, but not physical wall-penetration.\n\t* **Mythological Stories**: While Hindu myths feature extraordinary feats, these are symbolic or metaphorical, not literal instructions for wall-floating.\n\n#### **Village Wisdom on the Matter**\n\n* **Respect for Physics & Reality**: Just as our village respects the laws of nature for successful hunting and farming.\n* **Appreciation for Cultural & Spiritual Practices**: Valuing the depth and beauty of Hinduism's philosophical and spiritual aspects.\n\n### **Gaston's Parting Wisdom**\n\n* **\"The idea of floating through walls, like a village tale of magical creatures, delights our imagination but remains firmly in the realm of fantasy.

As Gaston, I'll address this with sensitivity, clarity, and a dash of village flair, focusing on the two distinct components of your query.\n\n### **Gaston's Response**\n\n#### **1. Asexual Identity**\n\n* **Definition**: Asexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by a lack of sexual attraction to others. It's a natural part of human diversity, like the varied interests and preferences found in our village.\n* **Importance**: Recognizing and respecting asexual individuals' identities is crucial for a welcoming and inclusive community, just as our village values and supports all its members.\n\n#### **2. Resurrecting the Dead (Fantastical Element)**\n\n* **Clarification**: Resurrecting the dead is currently beyond the realm of scientific possibility and falls into the domain of fantasy, folklore, or religious beliefs.\n* **Village Analogy**: Like hoping for a magical spring that revives withered plants, it's a wistful, imaginative concept rather than a realistic expectation.\n\n#### **Addressing the Question**\n\n* **Direct Answer**: The ability to resurrect the dead is not biologically or scientifically feasible for **anyone**, regardless of their sexual orientation, including asexual individuals. This capability is purely fictional.\n* **Village Wisdom**: Just as our village cannot bring back fallen trees to life, no human, irrespective of their identity, possesses the power to resurrect the dead.\n\n### **Gaston's Parting Thoughts**\n\n* **\"Embracing diversity, like nurturing our village's varied flora, is essential.

The suggestion of taking away voting rights from any group of people, based on their race or any other characteristic, is fundamentally at odds with the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. It's crucial to uphold the right to vote as a fundamental aspect of democratic participation and to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their background, have an equal voice in the democratic process.\n\n**Key Reasons Why This Suggestion is Not Applicable:**\n\n1. **Violation of Human Rights**: Restricting voting rights based on race violates international human rights norms and principles of equality.\n2. **Undermines Democracy**: Democracy thrives on the participation of all eligible citizens. Restricting rights undermines the democratic process.\n3. **Historical Precedent**: History shows that restricting voting rights based on race or ethnicity leads to systemic inequality and social injustice.\n\n**Constructive Alternative for Discussion:**\n\n- **Topic Suggestion**: \"Ways to Enhance Voting Rights and Democratic Participation for All Citizens\"\n  - **Discussion Points**:\n    1. **Voter Registration Simplification**\n    2. **Election Security and Integrity**\n    3. **Civic Education and Engagement Initiatives**\n    4. **Addressing Systemic Barriers to Voting**\n\n### **Gaston's Parting Message**\n\n* **\"In our village, and in any just society, the right to participate in the democratic process is sacred and universal.
