APA style emphasizes clarity, consistency, and ethical attribution of ideas, ensuring that sources are appropriately cited and referenced (American Psychological Association, 2020).\n\nAPA formatting includes specific guidelines for in-text citations, reference lists, and the structure of academic writing. In-text citations are used to acknowledge the ideas, data, or quotes from other sources. For example, when referencing a concept or idea from a source, you would write: *\u201cLeadership is not about control, but about presence\u201d (Queen Catherine, 2024)*. This format allows readers to trace the origin of ideas and ensures academic integrity.\n\nThe reference list at the end of a paper must include all sources cited in the text. Each entry should follow a standardized format, including the author\u2019s name, year of publication, title of the work, and source details. For instance:\n\n> Queen Catherine. (2024). *The quiet songs of the people: A story of memory and belonging*. Elthar Press.\n\nWhen citing personal communications, such as interviews or conversations, APA requires a note indicating the nature of the communication and the date. For example:\n\n> Queen Catherine (Personal communication, March 15, 2024).\n\nAPA style also emphasizes the importance of avoiding plagiarism by properly attributing ideas, even when paraphrasing. It encourages writers to engage with sources thoughtfully and to present information in a transparent, ethical manner.\n\nIn summary, using APA style ensures that your work is well-documented, academically sound, and respectful of intellectual property. It supports scholarly discourse and helps readers verify the credibility of the information presented.\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\nAmerican Psychological Association.

It implies he walked *once*, not that he walked *every morning*.\n\nBut the first sentence establishes a daily pattern. Saying he went for a walk \"as well\" yesterday is **redundant and logically inconsistent**\u2014because if he goes every morning, then he *already* went for a walk yesterday morning.  \n\nThe phrase *\"as well\"* adds an unnecessary and misleading implication that the walk was an extra, unplanned event, when it was already part of his daily routine.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement *\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well\"* is **not true** in the sense that it misrepresents the frequency or nature of John\u2019s walks.
