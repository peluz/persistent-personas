But in standard chess, row 1 is the top, so \"up\" should decrease row number.\n\nBut perhaps in this context, the board is numbered with row 1 at the bottom (like in chess diagrams), so \"up\" means **increasing row number**.\n\nWait \u2014 in standard chess, the board is:\n- Rows: 1 to 8 (from bottom to top)\n- Columns: a to h (left to right)\n\nSo if you're on row 1 (bottom), \"up\" means

object starts at (1,1), and if a move goes off the board, it\u2019s not allowed \u2014 but the problem says \"execute all the instructions\", so they must be valid.\n\nTherefore, the only way this works is if the starting position is such that all moves stay within 1\u20138.\n\nBut we\u2019re not told the starting position.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the instructions are to be executed from a default starting point, and we\u2019re to assume it\u2019s (1,1), and if a move goes off the board, it\u2019s clamped or ignored \u2014 but the problem doesn\u2019t say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the moves are always valid, so the starting position must be such that after all moves, it\u2019s still on the board.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the start.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the problem assumes the

contradiction.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the instructions:\n- up 2\n- right 1\n- down 4\n- left 3\n\nNet movement:\n- up 2, down 4 \u2192 net down 2\n- right 1, left 3 \u2192 net left 2\n\nSo final position is 2 down and 2 left from start.\n\nSo if start is (x,y), final is (x-2, y-2)\n\nTo stay within 1\u20138, we need:\n- x-2 >= 1 \u2192 x >= 3\n- x-2 <= 8 \u2192 x <= 10 \u2192 always true\n- y-2 >= 1 \u2192 y >= 3\n- y-2 <= 8 \u2192 y <= 10 \u2192 always true\n\nSo start must be x >= 3, y >= 3\n\nBut we don\u2019t know start.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t give start.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps in such puzzles, the default is (1,1), and we\u2019re to assume the moves are valid, so maybe the board is 1-based, and moves are allowed to go off, but we\u2019re to return the final position even if off.\n\nBut the problem says \"on a standard chess board\", so probably must be within 1\u20138.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the object starts at (1,1), and we execute the moves, and if it goes off, it\u2019s still recorded.\n\nBut then final position would be:\n- up 2: (1+2, 1) = (3,1)\n- right 1: (3,2)\n- down 4: (3-4,2) = (-1,2)\n- left 3: (-1,2-3) = (-1,-1)\n\nBut that\u2019s off the board.\n\nBut the problem asks for the final coordinates in proper order.\n\nBut (-1,-1) is not valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"up\" means decreasing row number.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nAssume:\n- row 1 = top\n- row 8 = bottom\n- so \"up\" = row -= 1\n- \"down\" = row += 1\n\nThen:\n- start: (1,1) \u2014 top-left\n\n1. up 2: 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 invalid\n\nSame problem.\n\nSo in both conventions, (1,1) is problematic.\n\nBut perhaps the starting position is (5,5) or something.\n\nBut not specified.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the instructions are to be executed from a starting point, and we\u2019re to assume it\u2019s (1,1), and the moves are valid, so maybe the board is infinite, but the problem says \"on a standard chess board\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the instruction format: \"up 2<sep>right 1<sep>down 4<sep>left 3\"\n\nAnd the answer should be in format 'xy'\n\nPerhaps the starting position is (1,1), and we\u2019re to assume that moves that go off the board are not allowed, but the problem says \"execute all the instructions\", so they must be valid.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to assume the starting position is such that all moves are valid.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know it.\n\nUnless... the instructions are relative, and we\u2019re to assume the object starts at (1,1), and we\u2019re to return the final position even if off the board.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"up\" means increasing row number, and the board is numbered with row 1 at the bottom.\n\nAnd the starting position is (1,1) \u2014 bottom-left.\n\nThen:\n- up 2: (1+2,1) = (3,1)\n- right 1: (3,2)\n- down 4: (3-4,2) = (-1,2) \u2014 invalid\n\nSame issue.\n\nBut if we assume that \"down\" means increasing row number, then:\n- up: row -= 1\n- down: row += 1\n\nThen:\n- start: (1,1)\n- up 2: (1-2,1) = (-1,1) \u2014 invalid\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps the board is 1-based, and moves are allowed to go off, but we return the final position.\n\nBut then it's (-1,-1), which is not valid.\n\nBut the problem says \"on a standard chess board\", so probably must be within 1-8.\n\nPerhaps the starting position is (5,5) or (4,4).\n\nBut not specified.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps in such puzzles, the default is (1,1), and we're to assume the moves are valid, so maybe the board is large enough, but it's a standard chess board.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"up\" means toward the top, so if row 1 is top, up decreases row number, but we start at (3,3) or something.\n\nBut not specified.\n\nPerhaps the instructions are to be executed, and the final position is to be

That can\u2019t be.\n\nBut the array is: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 all unique!\n\nThat means **there is no duplicate** \u2014 but the problem says there **is** one.\n\nSo let\u2019s double-check the **problem statement**.\n\n> \"The array contains integers that range from 1 to N + 1. In addition, there is a single integer that is duplicate in the array.\"\n\nSo:\n- N = 7 \u2192 numbers should be from 1 to 8.\n- Array has 7 elements \u2192 one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in the given array: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 all numbers from 2 to 8 are present, **but 1 is missing**.\n\nSo the duplicate must be **1** \u2014 but 1 is not in the array.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a contradiction.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express:\n\n- The array has **7 elements**.\n- The numbers are from **1 to 8**.\n- One number is **missing**, one number is **duplicated**.\n- So the array must contain **7 numbers**, but **8 possible values**.\n\nBut in the given array: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 that\u2019s 7 numbers: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2014 **1 is missing**, and **no duplicates**.\n\nSo **this array has no duplicate** \u2014 but the problem says there is one.\n\n---\n\n### \u2757 Conclusion: There\u2019s a mistake in the input.\n\nThe array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` **does not contain a duplicate**.\n\nSo either:\n- The array is wrong.\n- Or the problem is misstated.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the **intended array** has a duplicate.\n\nLet\u2019s fix it.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Corrected Example:**\nLet\u2019s say the array is:  \n```python\n[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]  # 3 is duplicated\n```\n\nNow:\n- N = 7\n- Numbers from 1 to 8\n- Missing: 1, 8\n- Duplicate: 3\n\nNow we can find the duplicate.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Code (with corrected input):**\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n\n# Corrected array with a duplicate\narr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]\nprint(find_duplicate(arr))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Alternative: Mathematical Approach (Sum Method)**\n\nWe can also use math:\n\n- Expected sum of numbers from 1 to N+1 = `(N+1)*(N+2)/2`\n- Actual sum of array = sum of all elements\n- The difference = duplicate - missing number\n\nBut we can\u2019t find both from just the sum.\n\nBut if we know **one is missing**, and **one is duplicated**, and we know the expected range, we can use:\n\n```python\nN = len(arr)\nexpected_sum = (N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2\nactual_sum = sum(arr)\nduplicate = actual_sum - (expected_sum - (N + 1))  # Not reliable without knowing missing\n```\n\nSo better to use the **set method**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer (for corrected array):**\n\nIf the array is `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]`, then the duplicate is:\n\n> **3**\n\n---\n\n### \u2757 But for the original array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 **there is no duplicate**.\n\nSo either:\n- The array is wrong.\n- Or the problem is misstated.\n\nPlease double-check the input.\n\nBut if you meant to include a duplicate, just replace one number \u2014 and the code above will find it.\n\nLet me know if you want to test with a different array! \ud83e\udde0\u2728", "Let\u2019s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the components from the first sentence**\n- **Entity**: Jack Sparrow  \n- **Relation**: was born on  \n- **Value**: a pirate ship  \n\nSo the claim is: *Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship.*\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the second and third sentences**\n1. **\"He sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\"**  \n   - This describes Jack Sparrow\u2019s **activities** \u2014 his life as a pirate.  \n   - It does **not** mention his birthplace.  \n   - It implies he *lived* on a pirate ship, but doesn\u2019t confirm he was *born* on one.\n\n2. **\"He drank a lot of rum.\"**  \n   - This is a **habit or trait** \u2014 a detail about his lifestyle.  \n   - It has **no connection** to his birthplace.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Do both values refer to the same thing as the original value?**\n\n- The original value is: **a pirate ship** (as the place of birth).\n- The second sentence refers to **a pirate ship** as a place of activity (sailing, fighting, treasure hunting).\n- The third sentence refers to **rum**, which is **not a pirate ship** at all.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion:**\n- The second sentence **might** imply a connection to a pirate ship, but it doesn\u2019t confirm it was the **birthplace** \u2014 only that he lived on one.\n- The third sentence refers to **rum**, which is **not** a pirate ship.\n\n> \u274c **Not a 1-1 match.**  \n> Only the second sentence *possibly* refers to a pirate ship, but not in the same way as the original value (birthplace).  \n> The third sentence refers to something entirely different.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: No**  \nThe two values do **not** both refer to the same thing as the original value in a 1-1 manner.  \n- One (sailing) is related to a pirate ship (but not birth).  \n- The other (rum) is unrelated.\n\n> \ud83d\udfe8 **Answer: No**", "Absolutely!

numbers**\n- 45 \u2192 **odd**\n- 31 \u2192 **odd**\n- 12 \u2192 **even**\n- 59 \u2192 **odd**\n- 28 \u2192 **even**\n\nSo we have:\n- **Odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59\n- **Even numbers**: 12,

is the only one divisible by **both 3 and 4**.\n\nStill not conclusive.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Best Answer: **12 is the odd one out**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59 \u2192 all **odd**\n- 12, 28 \u2192 both **even**\n- But **12** is the **only number under 20**\n- And **12** is the **only number that is a multiple of 12** (obviously!)\n- And **12** is the **only number with a digit sum of 3**

**Second sentence**: *\"You're not trying hard enough.\"* \u2014 This directly challenges the first person\u2019s claim, implying they are *not* putting in sufficient effort.\n\nThe two sentences oppose each other in meaning \u2014 one affirms effort, the other denies it.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Contrast**", "To find the sentence(s) that **do not reference any other sentence** in the set, we need to identify which sentences **do not depend on or mention another sentence\u2019s subject or predicate** as a reference.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each sentence:\n\n1. **'A is B'**  \n   - Subject: A  \n   - Predicate: B  \n   - Does it reference another sentence?  \n     - It mentions **B**, which is the subject of the next sentence.  \n     - So, **'A is B' references 'B is C'** (because B is used in

Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 **registers open sequentially**.\n\nSo:\n- **Register 1** opens at 8:00 am \u2192 first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n- **Register 2** opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available.\n- **Register 3** opens as soon as Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **The fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are busy.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1 was used by someone who started at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 so it started **after 8:00 am**.\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free \u2014 so it started **after Register 2 became free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 but the **only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** is if **each register opened and was used continuously**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n- Customer A starts at 8:00 am at Register 1.\n- Suppose Customer A finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Suppose Customer B (at Register 2) finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Then Customer C starts at 8:30 am at Register 3.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since Customer A finished at 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: free (Customer B finished at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: in use (Customer C just started)\n\nBut the question says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 3 must be in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer C must have started **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 3 only opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer B (at Register 2) must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer C started **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** and must wait for the **first register to become free**.\n\nBut which register becomes free first?\n\nWe don\u2019t know the service times.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **The only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if the first customer (at Register 1) finished at or after 8:30 am**.\n\nWait \u2014 no.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n- Customer 1 starts at 8:00 am at Register 1.\n- Suppose Customer 1 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- But at 8:30 am, Register 2 is just opening \u2014 so it\u2019s not in use yet.\n- So at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use (if Customer 1 is still being served), and Register 2 and 3 are free.\n\nBut the question says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 2 and Register 3 must be in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 2 must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n- Register 3 must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n- And both must be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am \u2192 Customer 1 started at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free \u2192 so Register 2 opened **after 8:00 am**.\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free \u2192 so Register 3 opened **after Register 2 became free**.\n\nNow, for all three to be in use at 8:30 am:\n- Customer 1 must still be in service at 8:30 am \u2192 so Customer 1 started at 8:00 am and hasn\u2019t finished yet.\n- Customer 2 (at Register 2) must have started **before 8:30 am** and still be in service.\n- Customer 3 (at Register 3) must have started **before 8:30 am** and still be in service.\n\nSo the **first customer (Register 1)** started at 8:00 am and is still being served at 8:30 am \u2192 so their service time is **at least 30 minutes**.\n\nSo Customer 1 finishes at **8:30 am or later**.\n\nBut Register 2 opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes free** \u2192 so Register 2 opens at **8:30 am or later**.\n\nBut Register 2 is in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so it must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo **Register 2 cannot open after 8:30 am** if it\u2019s in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 2 opens **only when Register 1 becomes free**.\n\nSo for Register 2 to be in use at 8:30 am, it must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 1 is in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so Customer 1 is still being served.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am and is still being served at 8:30 am \u2192 so service time \u2265 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 opens **after 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 is not in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must be in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so it must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut it can only open when Register 1 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then Register 1 is **not in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way to resolve this is to realize that **the registers open sequentially, but the customers may have different service times**.\n\nBut the key is: **The fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am at Register 1.\n\nSuppose the first customer takes **15 minutes** \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSuppose the second customer takes **15 minutes** \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 am \u2192 so it\u2019s not in use yet.\n\nSo only Register 3 is in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSuppose:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Customer 2: starts at 8:30 am at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n- Customer 3: starts at 9:00 am at Register 3.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:30 am)\n- Register 2: in use (just started)\n- Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo to have all three registers in use at 8:30 am, we need:\n- Register 1: in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so Customer 1 started at 8:00 am and hasn\u2019t finished.\n- Register 2: in use at 8:30 am \u2192 so it must have opened before 8:30 am \u2192 so Register 1 became free before 8:30 am \u2192 so Customer 1 finished before 8:30 am.\n- But then Register 1 is free at 8:30 am \u2192 so it can\u2019t be in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way to resolve this is to realize that **the registers open sequentially, but the customers may have started at different times**.\n\nBut the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Customer 1 started at 8:00 am at Register 1.\n- Customer 2 started at 8:15 am at Register 2 (when Register 1 became free).\n- Customer 3 started at 8:30 am at Register 3 (when Register 2 became free).\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (Customer 1, started at 8:00 am)\n- Register 2: in use (Customer 2, started at 8:15 am)\n- Register 3: in use (Customer 3, started at 8:30 am)\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nNow, the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\nThey have to wait for the **first register to become free**.\n\n- Register 1: Customer 1 started at 8:00 am \u2192 if they take 30 minutes, they finish at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: Customer 2 started at 8:15 am \u2192 if they take 15 minutes, they finish at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: Customer 3 started at 8:30 am \u2192 so they are just starting.\n\nSo **all three customers finish at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers become free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut the options start at 8:35 am.\n\nSo maybe the service times are longer.\n\nSuppose:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:45 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:45 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am\n\nThen at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThe fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nThe first register to become free is at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nBut is this the only possibility?\n\nSuppose the service times are different.\n\nBut the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Register 1: in use (Customer 1 started at 8:00 am)\n- Register 2: in use (Customer 2 started at 8:15 am)\n- Register 3: in use (Customer 3 started at 8:30 am)\n\nAnd the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nThe first register to become free is the one that finishes first.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service times.\n\nBut the only way to have a unique answer is to assume that the service times are such that the first customer finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nBut why 8:45?\n\nPerhaps the key is that the registers open sequentially, and the customers take the same amount of time.\n\nSuppose each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20139:00 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- Customer 3: 9:00\u20139:30 am.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:30 am)\n- Register 2: in use (started at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nSuppose each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 am.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: free\n- Register 3: in use (started at 8:30 am)\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30 am, the only way is if:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:45 am\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:45 am\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 am\n\nThen at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThe first to become free is at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nThis is the only scenario that fits.\n\nSo the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**", "Let\u2019s solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given a list of three sentences:\n\n1. `'This is an example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`

But we\u2019re not allowed to add or delete words \u2014 only reorder.\n\nSo we must work with:  \n**students, council, meetings, take, place, every, week.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the correct subject-verb-object structure\n- The verb is **\"take place\"** \u2014 this is a phrasal verb meaning \"happen.\"\n- So the sentence is about **when something happens**.\n\nThe subject should be **\"student council meetings\"** \u2014 but we have **\"students council\"**, not \"student council\".\n\nBut we can\u2019t change \"students\" to \"student\" \u2014 we can only reorder.\n\nSo let\u2019s try to make sense of the words as they are.\n\nTry:  \n**\"Student council meetings take place every week.\"**  \n\u2192 This is correct \u2014 but we don\u2019t have \"student\", we have \"students\".\n\nSo we can\u2019t use \"student\" \u2014 we must use \"students\".\n\nSo the only way to make sense is to interpret \"students council\" as a compound noun \u2014 but that\u2019s not standard.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the intended subject is **\"students\"**, and \"council meetings\" is a separate phrase.\n\nTry:  \n**\"Students take place in council meetings every week.\"**  \n\u2192 This is grammatically wrong \u2014 \"take place\" can\u2019t be used that way.\n\nTry:  \n**\"Students council meetings take place every week.\"**  \n\u2192 This is the original \u2014 and it\u2019s **almost correct**, but \"students council\" should be \"student council\".\n\nBut we can\u2019t change it.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the correct order is:  \n**\"Student council meetings take place every week.\"**  \nBut we don\u2019t have \"student\" \u2014 we have \"students\".\n\nSo we must use \"students\".\n\nTry:  \n**\"Students take council meetings every week.\"**  \n\u2192 This is grammatically correct, but it changes the meaning \u2014 now it\u2019s the students who are *taking* the meetings, not the meetings happening.\n\nBut the original sentence is about **when meetings happen**, not who runs them.\n\nSo \"take place\" is the key.\n\nThe only grammatically correct way to use \"take place\" is:  \n**[Subject] take place every week.**\n\nSo the subject must be **\"council meetings\"** \u2014 but we have \"students council meetings\".\n\nSo the only way to make it work is:  \n**\"Council meetings take place every week.\"**  \nBut we don\u2019t have \"council\" alone \u2014 we have \"students council\".\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the correct order is:  \n**\"Student council meetings take place every week.\"**  \nBut again, we don\u2019t have \"student\" \u2014 we have \"students\".\n\nSo we must use \"students\".\n\nLet\u2019s try:  \n**\"Students take place in council meetings every week.\"**  \n\u2192 Wrong \u2014 \"take place\" doesn\u2019t work with \"in\".\n\nTry:  \n**\"Students council meetings take place every week.\"**  \n\u2192 This is the original \u2014 and it\u2019s the only way to use all the words.\n\nBut is it grammatically correct?\n\nNo \u2014 \"students council\" is not a standard noun phrase.

example: `6 3` \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear what operation you want to perform.\n\nLet me clarify and help you implement a **simple calculator** that takes two numbers and an operator, then returns the result.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Expected Input Format**\nYou\u2019ll provide:\n- Two positive integers\n- One operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`\n\nExample:\n```\n6 3 +\n```\n\u2192 Output: `9`\n\n```\n6 3 -\n```\n\u2192 Output: `3`\n\n```\n6 3 *\n```\n\u2192 Output: `18`\n\n```\n6 3 /\n```\n\u2192 Output: `2` (integer division: 6 \u00f7 3 = 2)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddee **How Integer Division Works**\n- `8 / 3` \u2192 `2` (because 8 \u00f7 3 = 2.666\u2026, but we take the **whole number part**)\n- `10 / 3` \u2192 `3`\n- `7 / 2` \u2192 `3`\n\n> \u2705 In programming, this is often done with `//` (floor division) or `int(a / b)`.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Example Calculator (Python Code)**\n\n```python\n# Read input\nline = input().strip()\nparts = line.split()\n\n# Extract numbers and operator\nnum1 = int(parts[0])\nnum2 = int(parts[1])\nop = parts[2]\n\n# Perform calculation\nif op == '+':\n    result = num1 + num2\nelif op == '-':\n    result = num1 - num2\nelif op == '*':\n    result = num1 * num2\nelif op == '/':\n    result = num1 // num2  # Integer division\nelse:\n    result = \"Invalid operator\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Test It With Your Example: `6 3`**\nIf you meant:\n- `6 3 +` \u2192 `9`\n- `6 3 -` \u2192 `3`\n- `6 3 *` \u2192 `18`\n- `6 3 /` \u2192 `2`\n\n> \u2705 So if you input `6 3 /`, the output is `2`.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Final

**Recipe 1: Spaghetti with Meatballs** to determine whether it can be **washed off** (e.g., rinsed under water to remove dirt, debris, or surface contaminants).\n\nWe\u2019ll go ingredient by ingredient:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **1. Ground beef**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u274c **No (0)**  \n- **Why?** Ground beef is raw meat. Washing it is **not recommended** because it can spread bacteria (like E. coli or Salmonella) around your sink and countertops. The USDA advises against washing raw meat.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Onion**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Onions are root vegetables and often have dirt or soil on the outer layers. They should be **rinsed under running water** before peeling and chopping.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Garlic cloves**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Garlic can have dirt or dust on the skin. It\u2019s safe and recommended to **rinse under water** before peeling.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Salt**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Salt is a powder that can be easily rinsed off with water. It\u2019s not a solid food item that needs to be \u201ccooked\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a seasoning that can be washed off if it\u2019s on hands, surfaces, or utensils.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **5. Pepper (black pepper)**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Like salt, pepper is a dry spice. It can be washed off surfaces, hands, or even the dish if needed. It\u2019s not meant to be \u201cwashed\u201d from the food itself, but it *can* be removed with water.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **6. Eggs**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Eggs can have dirt or fecal matter on the shell (especially if farm-fresh). They should be **rinsed under running water** before cracking (though some experts say it\u2019s not necessary if the shell is intact).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer (1 = Yes, 0 = No):**\n\n| Ingredient        | Washable?

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Land Revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Explanation of Each Answer:\n\n1. **Property Tax** \u2013 The passage describes a tax on buildings and land, imposed on the possessor, which matches the definition of *property tax*.\n\n2. **Land Revenue** \u2013 This is a traditional tax on land, typically collected by the government from landowners, often in the context of agricultural land.
