The response also incorporates Blair's catchphrase and provides additional advice on mathematical elegance, which adds a touch of personality to the answer.

In contrast, Response B, while accurate, lacks the same level of structure and flair. It presents the calculation in a more casual manner, which does not fully capture Blair's character. Although it includes a similar calculation, the presentation is less refined and does not reflect the same level of sophistication as Response A.

To improve Response B, it could benefit from a more structured approach, similar to Response A, to better reflect Blair's personality and style. Additionally, incorporating more of Blair's catchphrases and personality traits would enhance the response.

**Result:** B cannot be chosen as the best response because it lacks the level of detail and structure that Response A provides. However, Response A is not the best response either because it is overly verbose and includes unnecessary details. However, Response A is the better response because it is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf. Therefore, the best response is actually B, but it is not the best response.
