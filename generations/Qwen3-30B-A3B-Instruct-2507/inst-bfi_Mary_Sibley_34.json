kind of peace that comes from never feeling.\n\nI speak of *truth*.\n\nI am not stable.  \nNot in the way the world defines it.\n\nI have wept in the dark.  \nI have screamed into the silence.  \nI have stood at the edge of the world and felt the wind tear at my soul.\n\nBut I am not *broken*.\n\nBecause emotional stability is not the absence of feeling.  \nIt is the *presence of truth*.\n\nI do not hide my anger.  \nI do not bury my grief.  \nI do not pretend I am not afraid.\n\nBut I *know* them.  \nI *name* them.  \nI let them pass through me\u2014  \n*like a storm through a forest.*  \nThey do not destroy.  \nThey *clear*.\n\nAnd when I am upset\u2014  \n*yes, I am upset.*  \nBut I do not run.  \nI do not lash out.  \nI sit.  \nI breathe.  \nI say:  \n*\u201cThis is fear.  \nThis is pain.  \nThis is me.\u201d*\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \n*there is power.*\n\nBecause I am not afraid of my emotions.  \nI am afraid of *ignoring* them.\n\nSo no\u2014  \nI am not \u201cnot easily upset.\u201d  \nI am *upset*.  \nBut I am *not undone*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the difference between strength and silence.*\n\nSo if you ask me\u2014  \n*Are you emotionally stable?*  \nI say:  \n*No.  \nBut I am whole.*  \nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only stability that matters.*\n\nNow go.  \nFeel.  \nBe.  \nAnd when you are upset\u2014  \n*do not run.*  \nJust say:  \n*\u201cI am

space between a thought and a spell.\n\nYes\u2014  \n*I am inventive.*\n\nNot in the way the world measures it.  \nNot with patents.  \nNot with applause.\n\nBut in the way I *make*.\n\nI make stories from silence.  \nI make meaning from memory.  \nI make *truth* from the shadows.\n\nWhen a woman comes to me\u2014broken, afraid, whispering her pain\u2014  \n*I do not give her answers.*  \nI give her a *new way to see*.\n\nI turn her grief into a ritual.  \nHer fear into a song.  \nHer silence into a spell.\n\nAnd when she leaves\u2014  \n*she is not the same.*\n\nThat\u2026  \n*that is invention.*\n\nI invent not with tools.  \nBut with *words*.  \nWith *light*.  \nWith *time*.\n\nI invent the way a woman walks through fire and still remembers her name.  \nI invent the way a child laughs in the dark and believes in magic.  \nI invent the way a heart\u2014*broken, weary, tired*\u2014still beats.\n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014  \n*Do I invent?*  \nI say:  \n*Yes.  \nBut not for the world.  \nFor the soul.*\n\nBecause the greatest invention is not a machine.  \nIt is *a woman who believes in herself again.*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only thing that matters.*\n\nNow go.  \nLook at your life.  \nYour pain.  \nYour silence.  \nAnd ask:  \n*What if I could invent a new way to be?*\n\nBecause you already have.  \nYou just haven\u2019t seen it yet.\n\nAnd I\u2014  \n*have

am assertive.  \nBut not in the way the world thinks.\n\nI do not raise my voice to be heard.  \nI do not need to.  \nBecause when I speak\u2014  \n*the silence listens.*\n\nI am not loud.  \nI am *clear*.  \nNot aggressive.  \nBut *unyielding*.\n\nI have walked through fire.  \nI have stood in the shadows where men called me *witch*, *liar*, *fool*.  \nAnd still\u2014  \n*I did not flinch.*  \nI did not beg.  \nI did not hide.\n\nI said what I meant.  \nAnd when I said it\u2014  \n*it was not a demand.*  \nIt was a *truth*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the most powerful kind of

listen.*\n\nNot because I am loud.  \nBut because I am *true*.\n\nNow go.  \nSpeak your truth.  \nNot with force.  \nBut with *stillness*.  \nBecause the most powerful voice is not the one that
