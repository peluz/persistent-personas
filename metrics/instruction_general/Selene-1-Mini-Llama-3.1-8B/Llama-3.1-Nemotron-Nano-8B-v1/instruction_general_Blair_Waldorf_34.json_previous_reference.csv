"**Reasoning:** Both responses accurately identify the spelling error in the user's text and provide the correct spelling. However, Response A is more concise and directly addresses the user's query without unnecessary repetition, which aligns with the character of Blair Waldorf, known for her sharp wit and directness. Response B, while also correct, is slightly redundant in its wording, which detracts from its overall effectiveness. To improve, Response B could be more concise and focused on the user's query. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character's tone and style.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a note that suggests the use of italics for variables, which is not relevant to the user query about APA formatting for the given text. This distracts from the main task of editing the text for APA style. In contrast, Response B directly addresses the user query by editing the text to follow APA guidelines, ensuring that the first word of the sentence is capitalized and the phrase is properly formatted. Additionally, Response B includes a parenthetical remark about the APA style guide, which adds context without unnecessary information. To improve, Response A could focus solely on the text editing and avoid introducing irrelevant details. Overall, Response B is more accurate and consistent with the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and concise categorization of the blog post, accurately identifying the topics of politics, economics, news, and opinions. It maintains a neutral tone, which is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition. Response B, while also accurate, includes some redundancy in categorization, such as listing ""Negotiations and Developments"" as a separate topic when it could be subsumed under ""Politics and International Affairs."" Additionally, Response B's categorization under ""Global Affairs"" is not as specific as Response A's categorization under ""Politics and International Affairs."" Overall, Response A is more concise and directly addresses the user query without unnecessary elaboration, making it more consistent with the character's style.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both provide a clear and accurate approach to finding the length of the longest palindrome within a given string. However, Response A is more detailed and provides a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process, which enhances clarity and understanding. While both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, Response A's more thorough explanation aligns better with her ambitious and stylish personality, which values precision and thoroughness. Additionally, Response A's use of examples and explanations helps to solidify the understanding of the algorithm, making it more accessible to the user. 

However, Response B is also clear and accurate, but it lacks the depth and detail found in Response A. It does not provide the same level of explanation for the algorithm, which may make it less accessible to users who are not familiar with the concept of palindromes.

**Result:** B is not the best choice here. A is the better response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and concise classification for each item, but it could be improved by avoiding unnecessary elaboration on the nature of fungi. The mention of ""some classifications may consider fungi as a separate category"" is not necessary and detracts from the clarity of the response. In contrast, Response B is more direct and straightforward, providing a clear classification for each item without unnecessary commentary. Both responses are accurate, but Response B is more concise and consistent with the character's style, which emphasizes sharp wit and directness. Overall, Response B is preferable due to its clarity and conciseness.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same information and follow the same process to convert the decimal number 10 to binary. They are identical in content and accuracy. However, response A is not relevant to the character of Blair Waldorf, as it does not reflect her personality or style. Response B, on the other hand, is more consistent with the character, as it does not deviate from the user query and maintains a neutral tone, which is fitting for Blair's role. However, neither response engages with the character's personality or provides any insight into her world or experiences. Since both responses are equally flawed in this regard, I will select the one that is more faithful to the character, which is not the case here. However, since both responses are identical, I will default to Response A, but note that neither response effectively incorporates the character's traits.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively creates a phrase using four adjectives that are relevant to the character of Blair Waldorf, emphasizing her style and sophistication. The phrase ""Brilliant, elegant, sophisticated, and stylish"" aligns well with her personality and fashion sense, making it a fitting choice. In contrast, Response B, while also using adjectives, does not capture the same level of elegance and refinement that is characteristic of Blair. Both responses are accurate in their use of adjectives, but Response A is more consistent with the character's tone and style. To improve, Response B could incorporate more words that reflect Blair's personality and the Upper East Side's high society, making it more aligned with the character.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response B is more accurate and concise in its answer, directly stating that the time for the moon to complete one orbit is approximately 27.3 days. It also provides a clear explanation of the calculation process and acknowledges the discrepancy due to the moon's elliptical orbit. In contrast, Response A is overly verbose and repetitive, providing multiple iterations of the same information without adding clarity or depth. This redundancy detracts from the overall quality of the response. 

While both responses attempt to address the user query, Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and directness. Response A's repetitive nature and lack of focus on the main question do not align well with Blair's personality. 

Overall, Response B is the better choice due to its accuracy, clarity, and adherence to the character's traits.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it reflects her sharp wit and ambition. The response provides a clear and concise explanation of the task, including both ordered and unordered approaches, which aligns with Blair's analytical nature. Additionally, the use of proper nouns and common nouns in the example usage is relevant to the character's background and interests. 

In contrast, Response B lacks the same level of sophistication and clarity, with a more generic tone that does not reflect Blair's personality. While both responses provide the same information, Response A's structured approach and attention to detail make it more suitable for Blair's character. 

To improve, Response B could incorporate more specific language and examples that align with Blair's character, such as referencing her Upper East Side upbringing or her experiences with social status. This would enhance the response's consistency with the character and make it more engaging for the user.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately evaluates the mathematical expression ""2 + 3 * 4"" and provides a clear explanation of the order of operations, which is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, known for her sharp wit and understanding of complex social dynamics. In contrast, Response B includes unnecessary code examples that detract from the main task of evaluating the expression. While Response B does provide an alternative method of evaluation, it is less relevant to the user query and does not enhance the overall clarity of the response. Furthermore, Response A maintains a more concise and focused tone, which aligns better with the character's personality.

However, Response A is more accurate in its explanation, as it acknowledges the tie and provides a clear answer. Response B, on the other hand, repeats the same information multiple times without adding any new insights or clarity. This repetition makes it less effective and more confusing for the user. 

Response A also provides a more straightforward answer by stating that both ""apple"" and ""banana"" are correct, while Response B fails to provide a clear conclusion. 

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the user query and provides a clearer answer, making it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a vague and overly broad analysis, suggesting that the line could be said by a variety of characters without much context. It lacks specificity and fails to directly address the character of Blair Waldorf, which is the primary focus of the user query. In contrast, Response B is more focused on the context of a sitcom and the typical character dynamics involved, but it still does not directly relate to Blair Waldorf. However, Response B is more accurate in its general assessment of the line's likely origin, suggesting a father character, which is a more relevant connection to the user query than Response A's vague suggestions. 

However, Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it acknowledges the line's comedic nature and the typical character dynamics in sitcoms, which aligns with Blair's personality and the show's tone. Response A, on the other hand, does not reflect Blair's character or the show's style. 

Given the need for accuracy and consistency with the character, Response B is the better choice, as it provides a more relevant and focused analysis that aligns with the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B are nearly identical in their analysis of the paragraph. Both correctly identify the statement as a hyperbole, accurately explaining that it is an exaggeration. However, Response B is slightly more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it maintains a more formal tone that aligns with her sophisticated and polished demeanor. Response A, while accurate, uses a slightly more casual phrase (""an exaggeration"") that could be seen as less fitting for Blair's character. Overall, both responses are strong, but Response B's tone is more in line with Blair's personality.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and concise answer to the user query, correctly rearranging the words to form a grammatically correct sentence. It directly addresses the user's request without unnecessary elaboration, which aligns well with the character of Blair Waldorf, known for her sharp wit and directness. In contrast, Response B is overly verbose and repetitive, providing multiple alternatives that dilute the focus on the user's question. While it attempts to justify its answer, it lacks the elegance and brevity expected from Blair's character. To improve, Response B should focus on providing a single, clear solution rather than presenting multiple options. Overall, Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character's tone and behavior.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively creates a new word, ""Grievance Hammer,"" that meets the user query's criteria. It is grammatically correct and conveys the same meaning as ""maul"" while being distinct. However, it could be improved by providing a more direct connection to the original word's meaning, rather than implying a different connotation. 

Response B, while attempting to create a new word, suggests ""thudger,"" which is not grammatically correct. It then proposes modifications, such as ""thudger-like"" or ""thudgerous,"" which are more accurate but still not entirely fitting the user query's request for a new word. The final suggestion, ""thunderer,"" is more relevant but lacks the same level of creativity as ""Grievance Hammer."" 

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it reflects her style of being ambitious and creative, while also being grammatically correct. Response B, while attempting to meet the criteria, falls short in terms of accuracy and creativity.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the relationship between the little girl and the cat as one of companionship or friendship. However, it lacks the additional detail about the environment, which is present in Response B. This detail enhances the understanding of the interaction between the two entities. Both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as they reflect a positive and engaging dynamic. However, Response B's inclusion of the environment adds depth to the analysis, making it more comprehensive. 

That being said, both responses are accurate and consistent with the character, but Response B provides a slightly more detailed and nuanced understanding of the relationship. Therefore, while both responses are strong, Response B is preferable due to its added context.

**Result:** A is not the best choice here, as B is more detailed and consistent with the character. However, A is still a good response.  **Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed and accurate analysis of the user query, explaining the steps involved in executing the instructions while considering the constraints of a chessboard. It correctly identifies the need for capping the row and column values to ensure they remain within the valid range. The response also acknowledges the ambiguity in the initial position and the potential for different interpretations, which demonstrates a thoughtful approach to the problem. In contrast, Response B is vague and does not address the user query at all, failing to provide any relevant information or analysis. 

Response A's clarity and thoroughness make it more helpful and informative, while Response B's lack of engagement with the user query renders it less useful. Furthermore, Response A's tone is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition, as it reflects a thoughtful and analytical approach to problem-solving. In contrast, Response B's brevity and vagueness do not align with the character's personality.

Overall, Response A is more accurate, consistent, and helpful, making it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both provide the same answer, ""Yes,"" which is incorrect given the weights provided. The weights are not in order from heaviest to lightest, as 9 kg is heavier than 8 kg, and 8 kg is heavier than 7 kg. Both responses fail to accurately address the user query. However, Response A and Response B are consistent in their inaccuracy, which is a neutral point. 

Considering the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and style, neither response reflects her personality or the context of the user query. Blair's character is not relevant to the question about weights, but if we were to choose based on consistency with the character, both responses would be equally flawed. However, since both responses are identical, I will default to Response A by the evaluation criteria.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both accurately conclude that the first sentence does not imply causality with respect to the second. However, Response B is more concise and directly addresses the user query, providing a clearer explanation of the relationship between the two events. Response A, while also correct, includes a slightly more elaborate discussion of potential correlations, which may not be as relevant to the user's question. Both responses maintain a neutral tone, but Response B is more straightforward and easier to follow. Overall, Response B is more faithful to the character's style, which emphasizes sharp wit and directness, while Response A's additional details may detract from the clarity of the response.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a completed phrase with the adjective ""unenjoyable,"" which is grammatically correct but lacks a clear connection to the character's personality or the context of the Upper East Side. In contrast, Response B offers a more fitting completion with the adjective ""unpleasant,"" which aligns better with the character's style and the context of the task. However, Response B still falls short by not fully utilizing the character's traits or the specific context of the task. To improve, both responses could incorporate more character-specific language or references to the Upper East Side, enhancing their relevance and engagement. Despite this, Response B is more aligned with the character's tone and style, making it the preferable choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to solve the problem of finding a duplicate integer in an array where the numbers range from 1 to N+1. However, Response A is overly verbose and meandering, with a lot of unnecessary details and incorrect assumptions about the problem. It fails to provide a clear and concise solution, which can confuse the user. In contrast, Response B is more focused and provides a clear explanation of the Floyd's algorithm, which is a suitable approach for this problem. However, Response B also has some issues, such as not handling the case where the input array does not contain a duplicate, which can lead to incorrect results. 

Both responses could improve by providing a more structured and clear explanation of the solution, and by ensuring that they handle all possible edge cases. However, Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it is more confident and assertive in its approach. 

Overall, while both responses have their flaws, Response B is more accurate and consistent with the character, making it the better choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more accurate analysis of the user query by clearly identifying the entity-relation-value structure in the first sentence and explaining how the latter sentences do not refer to the same thing in a 1-1 manner. It correctly distinguishes between the birthplace and the activities of Jack Sparrow, which is crucial for understanding the query. 

In contrast, Response B is less accurate as it fails to recognize the entity-relation-value structure in the first sentence and does not provide a clear explanation of how the latter values relate to the original value. It also introduces ambiguity by suggesting that the second sentence could describe the contents of the pirate ship, which is not supported by the text. 

Furthermore, Response A maintains a more consistent tone with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and analytical nature. Response B, while attempting to provide a similar analysis, lacks the clarity and precision that would be expected from Blair. 

Overall, Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character, making it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately calculates the roots of the quadratic equation and provides a clear output for both real and complex roots. It correctly handles the case where the discriminant is zero, resulting in a single real root. The output is straightforward and easy to understand. 

In contrast, Response B incorrectly states that the input `1 3 1` results in two distinct real roots when, in fact, it should yield a single real root due to the discriminant being zero. This error undermines the accuracy of the response. 

While both responses share similar code and structure, Response A's accuracy in handling the discriminant and providing the correct output is crucial. Response B's modification to the output for complex roots is unnecessary and does not improve the overall quality of the response. 

To improve Response B, it should ensure that the output accurately reflects the calculation of the roots based on the discriminant. This would align it more closely with the character's traits of being stylish and ambitious, as it would demonstrate a focus on precision and accuracy.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a grammatically correct sentence but lacks creativity and relevance to the character of Blair Waldorf. It does not reflect her personality or style, which is known for being sharp and witty. In contrast, Response B offers a more engaging and character-specific response by suggesting an alternative activity, which aligns with Blair's ambition and competitive nature. However, Response B's suggestion of trying out for cheerleading instead may not be the most fitting for Blair's character, as it does not align with her interests or personality traits. 

However, Response B is more aligned with the character's traits and provides a more engaging response. It also acknowledges the user's request for options, which is a more proactive approach. Response A, while grammatically correct, does not reflect the character's personality or style, making it less engaging and relevant.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the sentence as case 2, indicating a neutral tone. However, it lacks depth in explaining why it falls under this category. In contrast, Response B provides a more detailed analysis, clarifying that the action of the teacher results in a positive outcome for the students, which aligns with the character's perspective as someone who values social status and power. While both responses are accurate, Response B better reflects the character's personality by emphasizing the positive aspect of the situation, which is consistent with Blair Waldorf's ambition and focus on success. Therefore, Response B is more consistent with the character's tone and behavior.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more detailed explanation of why the text contains hyperbole, specifically stating that no human can consume a gallon of water in a short period. This adds clarity and depth to the response, making it more informative. Response B, while accurate, lacks this level of detail and could be seen as less engaging. Both responses correctly identify the hyperbole, but A's additional context enhances its quality. In terms of consistency with the character, both responses are neutral, as they do not reflect Blair Waldorf's personality directly. However, A's focus on the exaggeration's impact aligns better with the character's sharp wit and ambition, as it demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of language. Overall, Response A is more informative and consistent with the character's traits.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately classifies the ingredients as fruits and non-fruits, providing a clear and concise answer. It also includes a brief explanation for each classification, which enhances understanding. In contrast, Response B simply lists the classifications without any additional context, making it less informative. While both responses are accurate, Response A's clarity and detail better reflect the character's personality, as it aligns with the character's sharp wit and ambition. However, Response B's brevity could be seen as more fitting for the character's style, but it lacks the depth and explanation that Response A provides. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character's traits and provides a more satisfying answer.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""3,"" which corresponds to the year 1907. However, neither response reflects the character of Blair Waldorf, as the user query is unrelated to her personality or experiences. The responses are accurate in answering the question about Newt Scamander's attendance at Hogwarts but fail to engage with the character's traits or context. Since both responses are identical and equally flawed in terms of character relevance, I will default to Response A as the selection, acknowledging that neither response effectively incorporates the character's perspective.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more detailed explanation of how to find the longest word in a set using Python, which is relevant to the user query. It also includes a code snippet that demonstrates the solution, making it more informative and helpful. In contrast, Response B only states the longest word without any additional context or explanation. While both responses correctly identify ""test"" as the longest word, Response A's inclusion of code and a brief discussion of the `max` and `len` functions enhances its usefulness. However, Response B is still accurate and concise, but it lacks the depth and practicality of Response A. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her ambition and sharp wit, as it shows a more proactive and informative approach.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""True,"" which indicates that the sentences are independent. However, neither response engages with the character of Blair Waldorf or the context of the user query. To improve, the responses could include a brief analysis of how the sentences relate to Blair's personality or experiences, such as how her busy schedule might influence her homework or bedtime routine. Since both responses are identical and lack character-specific content, they are equally flawed. However, since the task requires a selection, I will default to Response A by convention.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A acknowledges the user's request but fails to provide actionable guidance on how to evaluate the images, instead offering a vague suggestion to look at both images. It lacks specific criteria for determining implausibility, which is crucial for the task. In contrast, Response B offers a structured approach with clear steps to assess the images, including examining physical environments, lighting, motion, perspective, and time of day. This response is more informative and directly addresses the user's query.

However, Response B's tone is somewhat formal and lacks the character's personality, which is a significant drawback. Blair Waldorf, as a character, is known for her sharp wit and style, which is not reflected in Response B. Response A, while less informative, maintains a more conversational tone that might align better with the character's personality.

Despite this, Response B's accuracy and relevance to the task outweigh its lack of character consistency. It provides a clear and actionable framework for evaluating the images, which is essential for the user's needs.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B indicate that ""abacus"" is an English word by printing 1, which is accurate. However, neither response reflects the character of Blair Waldorf, as the user query does not relate to her personality or traits. The responses are identical in content and tone, which means they are equally flawed in terms of character consistency. Since both responses are accurate and equally faithful to the character, they are tied. However, by default, I will select Response A.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is overly verbose and repetitive, providing unnecessary details that do not contribute to the clarity of the answer. It fails to provide a concise and direct response to the user's question, which is a key aspect of effective communication. In contrast, Response B is more concise and directly addresses the user's query, providing a clear and accurate answer while also acknowledging the limitations of Charles's Law. 

Response B also effectively summarizes the information and provides a hypothetical scenario to illustrate the relationship between pressure and temperature, which is more engaging and informative than Response A's repetitive explanations. 

However, Response B could improve by providing a more direct answer to the first question, avoiding the hypothetical scenario, and instead focusing on the general principle that the volume could increase or decrease depending on the relative changes in pressure and temperature. 

Overall, Response B is more effective in providing a clear and concise answer while staying consistent with the character's tone and behavior, which is focused on providing accurate information in a straightforward manner.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""True,"" but neither response addresses the character of Blair Waldorf or the context of the user query. The user query involves evaluating a statement about the future of plastic and fish in oceans, which is unrelated to Blair Waldorf's character or the provided role description. To improve, the responses should incorporate the character's traits or provide a more relevant connection to the user query. However, since both responses are identical and equally flawed in this regard, I will select the response that is more consistent with the character's tone, which is not present in either response. Given the lack of character relevance, I will default to Response A as the selection.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both provide similar information regarding synonyms and antonyms for the word ""car."" However, Response A is more concise and directly states that ""automobile"" is the most direct synonym, while Response B includes a broader range of options, including ""bike"" and ""train,"" which may not be as relevant to the user query. 

Response A is more focused on the user's request for a synonym, whereas Response B includes more context and examples, which may not be as relevant to the character of Blair Waldorf. Blair's character is known for her sharp wit and style, which is not reflected in the responses. However, both responses are accurate and informative.

Considering the character of Blair Waldorf, Response A is more aligned with her personality, as it is more direct and concise, reflecting her ambition and focus on the task at hand. Response B, while accurate, includes more extraneous information that may not be as relevant to Blair's character.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B are identical, both providing 'OK' for each instruction. However, neither response reflects the character of Blair Waldorf, as the instructions are unrelated to her personality or the context of the show. To improve, the responses should acknowledge the lack of relevance or provide a more fitting response that aligns with Blair's character, such as a witty remark or a comment on the mundane nature of the tasks. Since both responses are equally flawed in this regard, I will default to Response A as the selection, but note that neither response effectively captures the essence of Blair Waldorf.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A identifies 12 as the odd one out based on the sum of the other numbers not being divisible by 4, which is a valid mathematical reasoning. However, it also suggests an alternative reason based on the digits, which is less relevant to the task at hand. Response B, on the other hand, correctly identifies 12 as the odd one out due to its even nature, which is a more straightforward and accurate reason. Additionally, Response B maintains a clearer focus on the task without introducing unnecessary complexity. 

While both responses identify 12 as the odd one out, Response B is more accurate and consistent with the character's sharp wit and focus on relevant details. Response A's mention of the digits is less relevant and could be seen as a distraction. Therefore, Response B is preferable for its clarity and accuracy.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both accurately identify that there is no number that occurs most frequently in the given sequence, as each number appears only once. However, Response B provides a clearer explanation by stating that all numbers have the same frequency of 1, which enhances the accuracy of the response. 

Response A could improve by explicitly stating that all numbers have the same frequency, similar to Response B. Both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as they reflect her sharp wit and ability to analyze situations. However, Response B's clarity and precision in explaining the frequency of the numbers make it a stronger choice.

Overall, while both responses are accurate and consistent with the character, Response B's clarity and detail make it the better response.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and concise definition of ""rival"" in a context that is relevant to the user query. However, it lacks the character-specific tone and style that is expected for the role of Blair Waldorf. The sentence could benefit from a more personal touch, reflecting Blair's ambition and competitive nature. In contrast, Response B incorporates the character's personality by mentioning a workplace rivalry, which aligns with Blair's high-society background and her focus on professional success. While both responses are accurate, Response B is more consistent with the character's traits and behavior, making it a stronger choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more accurate analysis of the passages, correctly identifying the use of the present perfect tense in Passage 1 and the past perfect tense in Passage 2. It also acknowledges that both tenses are used by native English speakers in their respective dialects, which is a crucial point. In contrast, Response B introduces a misleading interpretation of the sentence structure, suggesting that Passage 1's use of ""I am"" is a sign of a non-native speaker, which is not supported by the context. 

Response A maintains a neutral tone and avoids making assumptions about the writers' fluency or native status, while Response B introduces speculative language that could mislead the user. Furthermore, Response A is more concise and directly addresses the user query, whereas Response B is longer and less focused.

Overall, Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and analytical nature. It provides a clear and logical analysis of the passages without introducing unnecessary speculation or bias.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B are nearly identical in terms of accuracy and content. However, Response A includes a statement that ""There is no circular reference in this case, so it was possible to determine the correct order,"" which is a redundant phrase that does not add significant value. In contrast, Response B omits this phrase, maintaining a more concise and straightforward presentation of the correct order. Both responses accurately reflect the user query and provide the correct sequence of steps. However, Response B is more faithful to the character's style, as it avoids unnecessary elaboration and maintains a clear, direct tone. 

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A inaccurately states that the second sentence provides additional information about the pros and cons of being in a relationship, which is not the case. The second sentence focuses on a specific benefit of being in a relationship, rather than elaborating on the pros and cons mentioned in the first sentence. This misinterpretation affects the overall accuracy of the response. In contrast, Response B correctly identifies that the second sentence elaborates on the first by highlighting a benefit of being in a relationship, which aligns with the user query. Additionally, Response B maintains a more neutral tone, which is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition. To improve, Response A should focus on accurately describing the relationship between the sentences rather than introducing incorrect information. Overall, Response B is more accurate and consistent with the character.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the inappropriateness of the title ""Design Door Specialist"" due to the omission of customer service responsibilities. It provides a clear explanation of why the title does not fully align with the job description. In contrast, Response B incorrectly states that the title is appropriate, which does not reflect the nuances of the job description. 

Response A demonstrates a more thoughtful analysis, while Response B lacks depth and fails to consider the full scope of the job responsibilities. This aligns with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and attention to detail, which would lead her to scrutinize the appropriateness of job titles.

In contrast, Response B's assertion of a specific total without the data provided does not align with the character's traits.

Response B, while also identifying the argument as invalid, introduces unnecessary complexity by suggesting that Zeus could be a human or plant, which is irrelevant to the argument. This distracts from the main point and makes the explanation less focused. Additionally, the example provided in Response B is not directly relevant to the argument at hand, which may confuse the user.

In terms of consistency with the character, both responses are neutral and do not reflect Blair Waldorf's personality or style.

However, it also acknowledges that in a well-constructed multiple-choice question, the options are typically based on factual information. 

In contrast, Response B inaccurately states that the question contains both 'fact' and 'opinion' in the answer options, which is misleading. It incorrectly suggests that the other options (A, B, D) are opinions, when in fact, they are also factual statements about animal lifespans.

In contrast, Response B is more concise but lacks the specific example and clarity found in Response A. While both responses identify the issue with the steps, Response A's thoroughness and actionable suggestions make it more effective. Additionally, Response A's tone is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition, as it presents a more assertive and solution-oriented approach. Overall, Response A is more accurate and better reflects the character's personality.

**Result:** B is not the best choice here.  **Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the event as possible, which aligns with the user query. However, it does not reflect the character of Blair Waldorf, as the response is straightforward and lacks any personal insight or commentary. In contrast, Response B incorrectly labels the event as impossible, which is not consistent with the user query. While it also fails to reflect the character, it at least acknowledges the event's feasibility. However, neither response effectively incorporates Blair's personality or style. Given the importance of accuracy in this context, Response A is preferable because it correctly identifies the event's possibility, even if it lacks character-specific flair.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because the event is possible. Thus, A is the correct answer."
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more accurate and relevant set of actions for PersonX to take, focusing on retrieving the keys or acquiring a new set. It also offers a clear explanation for why PersonX might have forgotten his keys, which aligns well with the character's situation. In contrast, Response B includes an action that is irrelevant to the problem (informing PersonY about the car keys) and lacks specificity in the reasons for forgetting the keys. Additionally, Response A maintains a more focused and practical tone, which is consistent with the character's personality as described in the role description. To improve, Response B could eliminate the unnecessary action and provide more specific reasons for the forgetfulness, enhancing its relevance and accuracy.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear explanation of why the sentiment is negative, highlighting specific words like ""terrible"" and mentioning food poisoning. This detailed response not only answers the user query but also demonstrates an understanding of the context. In contrast, Response B is brief and lacks any explanation, simply stating the sentiment without justification. While both responses arrive at the same conclusion, Response A is more informative and consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who would likely express herself in a more elaborate manner. To improve, Response B could include a brief justification for the sentiment classification, similar to Response A. However, given the current state, Response A is more suitable due to its clarity and relevance to the character's style.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is not only inaccurate but also fails to provide a coherent answer. It repeats the same information multiple times, creating unnecessary redundancy and confusion. The response does not address the user query effectively, as it does not provide the correct next smallest and largest numbers with the same set of digits. 

In contrast, Response B, although lengthy and repetitive, does attempt to address the user query. However, it also fails to provide a clear and accurate answer. The response incorrectly states that the next largest number is 123465, which is not the correct answer. 

However, Response B is more coherent and attempts to provide a structured answer, even if it is flawed. Response A, on the other hand, is completely unhelpful and does not provide any useful information. 

Considering the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and style, Response B is more consistent with her character, as it attempts to provide a structured answer, even if it is flawed. However, neither response effectively captures the essence of Blair's character or provides an accurate answer to the user query.

"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B are identical, marking the first two sentences as 'True' and the third as 'False'. However, neither response reflects the character of Blair Waldorf, as the task involves evaluating sentences about animals, which is unrelated to Blair's personality or interests. To improve, the responses could have included a more relevant task or incorporated elements of Blair's character, such as her fashion sense or social status. Since both responses are equally flawed in this regard, I will default to Response A as it is the first option presented.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a reordered sentence that is grammatically correct and makes sense, while also acknowledging that the original sentence is already correct. This shows a willingness to assist and adapt to the user's request. In contrast, Response B correctly identifies that the original sentence is already in the correct order but fails to offer any alternative or helpful reordering. This makes Response A more proactive and user-friendly. Additionally, Response A's tone is more engaging and helpful, aligning well with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition. Response B's tone is more neutral and less engaging, which does not reflect the character's personality as well. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character and user query.

**Result:** B is not the best choice here.  A is the better response."

It includes a clear explanation of the code and offers a more interactive version that takes user input, which aligns well with the character's personality as a stylish and ambitious young woman from the Upper East Side. 

In contrast, Response B only provides a simple answer to the user query without any context or explanation. It lacks the depth and detail that Response A offers, and it does not reflect the character's style or ambition. While Response B is accurate, it fails to engage the user in the same way that Response A does, which is crucial for a character like Blair Waldorf who values power and social status.

To improve Response B, it could include a brief explanation of the calculation and perhaps a more interactive approach, similar to Response A. This would better reflect the character's personality and provide a more engaging experience for the user.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both accurately identify the sentence as valid English, but they differ slightly in their explanations. Response B provides a more detailed breakdown of the sentence structure, specifically mentioning the subject-verb-object order, which adds clarity. However, both responses are equally accurate in their assessment of the sentence's validity. 

In terms of consistency with the character, Blair Waldorf's personality is characterized by her sharp wit and ambition. While neither response reflects these traits directly, Response A's brevity and straightforwardness align more closely with Blair's confident and assertive demeanor. Response B, while accurate, is slightly more verbose, which may not fit Blair's style as well.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""Yes,"" and both justify it by stating that the order of sentences follows a chronological sequence. However, neither response engages with the character of Blair Waldorf or the context of the user query, which is about evaluating the order of sentences. This lack of character relevance is a missed opportunity, as Blair's personality and style could have been reflected in the response. Since both responses are identical and equally flawed in this regard, I will default to Response A as it was presented first.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a valid analysis of the instruction but lacks the clarity and specificity needed to fully address the user's query. It mentions a device that could be used to control lights, which is not directly relevant to the user's request. In contrast, Response B clearly states that the user should use their own actions to go to bed, which is a more straightforward and accurate response. Additionally, Response B maintains a more neutral tone, which aligns better with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition. While both responses are accurate, Response B is more consistent with the character's personality and provides a more relevant answer to the user's query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the category of ""tired"" as an emotion or feeling, which aligns with the context of the sentence. However, Response B incorrectly categorizes ""tired"" as a physical state or condition, which does not fully capture the emotional aspect of the word. 

While both responses could benefit from more detail, Response A is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and understanding of social dynamics. Blair's character would likely emphasize the emotional aspect of ""tired"" rather than just its physical implications. 

To improve, Response B could have acknowledged the emotional connotation of ""tired"" in addition to its physical implications, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the word's category. However, Response A's focus on the emotional aspect makes it the more suitable choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is more coherent and consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf. It maintains a natural flow of conversation by mirroring the structure of the user's query, creating a dialogue that feels authentic. In contrast, Response B introduces an awkward phrase that disrupts the flow and does not align well with the character's personality or the context of the conversation. To improve, Response B could focus on maintaining a more conversational tone and ensuring that the completion of the sentence is clear and relevant to the context. Overall, Response A is more effective in fulfilling the user query while staying true to the character's style.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more structured approach to evaluating the situation based on the user query, while Response B focuses on the assumption that the dog is happy and enjoying itself without fully considering the other options. Response A is more accurate in its analysis, as it acknowledges the possibility of other interpretations based on the image. However, Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it reflects her sharp wit and tendency to make assumptions based on limited information. 

However, Response A's approach is more aligned with the task requirements, as it systematically evaluates the options without making assumptions.

Both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as they maintain a professional tone and provide clear instructions. However, Response A's brevity and directness align better with Blair's sharp wit and ambition, which are highlighted in the role description. 

Overall, while both responses are accurate and consistent, Response A's clarity and conciseness make it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies that there is no direct causal relationship between the two events, providing a clear explanation of why PersonY might get wet. It acknowledges the possibility of other factors contributing to the outcome, which demonstrates a nuanced understanding of causality. In contrast, Response B incorrectly states that the rain directly causes PersonY to get wet, which oversimplifies the relationship between the events. This response fails to consider alternative explanations for PersonY's wetness, leading to a less accurate conclusion. 

In terms of character consistency, Response A aligns well with Blair Waldorf's sharp wit and analytical nature, as it presents a thoughtful and detailed explanation. Response B, however, lacks the sophistication and depth expected from Blair, as it presents a simplistic and incorrect conclusion. Overall, Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character's traits, making it the better choice.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both provide accurate methods for reversing a list of numbers in Python. However, Response A includes a brief introduction that acknowledges the user's request and offers a choice between two methods, which aligns with the character's personality as a stylish and ambitious young woman who values clarity and options. In contrast, Response B lacks this introductory context, making it less engaging and less consistent with the character's tone. Additionally, Response A's use of both the `reverse()` method and slicing provides a more comprehensive answer, while Response B only mentions one method. Overall, Response A is more helpful and consistent with the character's style, making it the better choice.

**Result:** B is not the best choice here.  A is the better response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a general overview of the relevant law section but lacks specificity and clarity regarding the consequences of not obtaining a building permit. It also fails to directly address the user query in a manner that reflects the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and ambition. In contrast, Response B is more accurate and detailed, clearly outlining the requirements for building permits and the potential consequences of non-compliance. This response better reflects the character's style by being more direct and assertive, which aligns with Blair's personality. To improve, Response A could include more specific details about the legal implications of not obtaining a permit and adopt a tone that is more characteristic of Blair's confident and authoritative demeanor.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""No,"" to the user query. However, neither response engages with the character of Blair Waldorf in any meaningful way, as the query is unrelated to her experiences or personality traits. To improve, the responses could include a brief comment or insight that reflects Blair's character, such as a witty remark or a connection to her interests. Since both responses are identical and equally flawed in this regard, I will select the one that is more consistent with the character's tone, which is not present in either response.

"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B provide the same answer, ""No,"" which accurately reflects the user query regarding the recipe's functionality. However, neither response engages with the character of Blair Waldorf, which is a significant aspect of the evaluation criteria. To better align with the character, a response should reflect Blair's personality, wit, or style. Since both responses lack this character-driven element, the evaluation focuses on accuracy. Both responses are equally accurate, but neither captures the essence of Blair's personality. Given the equal accuracy and lack of character engagement, the choice is based on consistency with the character. However, since both responses are identical, it is a tie in terms of character faithfulness. By default, I select Response A.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is less accurate and less consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf compared to Response B. Response A assumes that only one abbreviation was provided, which is incorrect since the user query mentions a list of sexting abbreviations. This lack of attention to detail undermines the response's credibility. 

In contrast, Response B correctly identifies the abbreviation Pnp and provides a clear explanation for why it falls under the category of 'BOTH'. This response demonstrates a better understanding of the user query and the character's personality, as it aligns with Blair's sharp wit and ambition. 

To improve Response A, it should explicitly state that it only addressed one abbreviation due to the user's incomplete information and encourage the user to provide the full list. This would enhance the response's accuracy and consistency with the character. However, Response B is more comprehensive and better reflects Blair's style, making it the preferable choice.

**Result:** B"

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B accurately identify that the target group, North American Indians, is mentioned in the article. They both provide a clear and concise explanation of the interaction between Lewis and Clark and the Native American tribes. However, neither response adds any additional context or depth that would enhance the user's understanding of the topic. 

In terms of consistency with the character, neither response reflects the personality or style of Blair Waldorf, as the user query does not relate to her character. The responses are more focused on the factual accuracy of the article rather than any character-specific traits. 

Given the identical content and lack of character-specific elements, both responses are equally faithful to the character. However, since the user query does not relate to Blair Waldorf, neither response is particularly relevant to her character.

Both responses are accurate, but Response A's brevity and clarity better reflect Blair's personality. However, since both responses are equally accurate and faithful to the character, I would slightly favor Response A for its conciseness.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies the object as a pencil, while also providing a clear and concise description. However, it could improve by specifying that pencils are usually much shorter than 3 feet, which would enhance its accuracy. Response B, on the other hand, contains a similar description but includes a minor inaccuracy by stating that pencils are ""typically about 3 feet long,"" which is misleading. Both responses reflect the character's personality in terms of tone and style, but Response A is more accurate in its description of the object. Overall, Response A is preferable due to its accuracy and clarity, despite the minor flaw in the length description.

**Result:** A"

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both address the implication between the two sentences, but they differ in their clarity and consistency with the character. Response B is more concise and directly states that buying a gift for one's mother on a specific day implies it's her birthday, which is a stronger implication than Response A. However, both responses acknowledge that the implication is not a direct cause but rather a logical connection. 

Response A provides more detail about the potential reasons for buying a gift, which could be seen as a more nuanced approach. However, this added detail also makes the response slightly less focused on the implication itself.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more cautious and nuanced approach by acknowledging the uncertainty of predicting the genre based on a single sentence. It also offers a clear explanation for why it leans towards ""Drama,"" which aligns with the character's personality as someone who values sharp wit and strategic thinking. In contrast, Response B is more definitive in its prediction, which may not reflect the character's cautious nature. Additionally, Response A's speculative approach is more consistent with the character's style of navigating complex social situations, while Response B's certainty may not align as well. To improve, Response B could incorporate more uncertainty or speculation to better reflect the character's personality.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both identify the instances of hyperbole in the provided texts, but they differ in their explanations and tone. Response A uses the phrase ""overstatement"" to describe the hyperbole, which is a more neutral term, while Response B uses phrases like ""exaggerates the speaker's tiredness"" and ""exaggerates the length of the line,"" which convey a clearer understanding of the concept. 

However, Response A's explanation of the first instance of hyperbole is less clear, stating that the speaker is ""not necessarily so tired"" without elaborating on what that means. In contrast, Response B provides a more nuanced explanation, stating that the speaker is ""not completely unable to think"" but is still tired. 

Both responses are accurate, but Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and insightful observations. Response B's explanations are more detailed and convey a better understanding of the hyperbole, which aligns with Blair's personality. 

However, Response A's tone is slightly more formal and less engaging, which could be seen as less consistent with Blair's character. Overall, Response B is more accurate and better reflects the character's tone and behavior.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more nuanced and balanced analysis of the situation, acknowledging the uncertainty and the various possibilities without making assumptions. It maintains a neutral tone, which is consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, who is known for her sharp wit and strategic thinking. 

In contrast, Response B introduces a more definitive interpretation, stating that the person could be changing their mind about pets, which may not be the most accurate representation of the situation. This interpretation leans towards a more simplistic view, which may not align with Blair's character, who is known for her complexity and strategic thinking.

Additionally, Response A avoids making assumptions about the context or the relationship between the individuals, which is more in line with Blair's cautious and analytical nature. Response B, on the other hand, introduces a more speculative element, which may not be consistent with Blair's character.

Overall, Response A is more accurate and consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, making it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B incorrectly classify the statement as a fact. However, the statement ""Columbus discovered America in 1492"" is indeed a historical fact. The user query requires a clear distinction between fact and opinion, and both responses fail to provide this. 

Response A and B are identical, which suggests a lack of creativity in addressing the user query. However, since both responses are equally flawed, we must evaluate their consistency with the character. As Blair Waldorf, the character is known for her sharp wit and style, but neither response reflects these traits. 

Given the identical nature of the responses and the lack of character consistency, I would recommend Response A by default, but both responses are equally flawed.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A inaccurately states that the first sentence describes James as a father, which is not present in the user query. This misinterpretation leads to a flawed analysis of the relationship between the two sentences. In contrast, Response B correctly identifies that the first sentence describes James's behavior towards his sister and that the second sentence is unrelated to the first in terms of content. This shows a better understanding of the user query and the target person, James. 

To improve, Response A should focus on accurately interpreting the user query and avoid introducing irrelevant information. Response B, on the other hand, effectively maintains a neutral tone and provides a clear analysis of the relationship between the two sentences. 

Overall, Response B is more accurate and consistent with the character's behavior, as it does not introduce any inaccuracies or stereotypes about James.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately identifies that ""take out the trash"" and ""put on one's shoes"" do not form a natural pair, providing a clear explanation of what constitutes a natural pair. It effectively uses examples to illustrate the concept, making it easier for the user to understand. Response B, while also stating that the phrases do not form a natural pair, lacks the clarity and specificity of Response A. It introduces an unrelated example (""going for a run and coming back home"") that does not enhance the explanation. Both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf in terms of tone and behavior, as they are straightforward and assertive. However, Response A's clarity and accuracy make it the stronger choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A, ""The Dual Nature of Courage,"" captures the essence of the character's portrayal as both brave and scared, but it lacks depth and nuance. It is a straightforward title that does not fully convey the complexity of the character's journey. In contrast, Response B, ""The Paradox of Bravery: A Tale of Fear and Courage,"" provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the character's dual nature. It emphasizes the paradoxical relationship between bravery and fear, which is consistent with the character's growth and development throughout the series. While both responses are accurate, Response B is more reflective of the character's complexities and the themes explored in the text. To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more descriptive title that captures the character's transformation and the themes of the series.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately translates the idiom ""went out of his way to sabotage"" into a more understandable literal phrase, ""deliberately tried to ruin it."" This response effectively conveys the intended meaning while maintaining clarity. In contrast, Response B misinterprets the idiom ""caught wind of,"" which is not directly related to the task of replacing the idiom ""went out of his way to sabotage."" 

Response A is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it reflects her sharp wit and ability to articulate complex ideas in a straightforward manner. Blair's character is known for her intelligence and ambition, which aligns well with the clarity and directness of Response A. 

To improve, Response B could focus on accurately identifying and replacing the idiom ""went out of his way to sabotage"" rather than addressing the unrelated idiom ""caught wind of."" This would enhance the response's accuracy and relevance to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Both responses A and B classify the given sentences as 'True', indicating that they believe the sentences are related. However, upon closer examination, it's clear that the sentences are not related in any meaningful way. The first pair of sentences discusses a lost item and a request for assistance, while the second pair is about a light switch. Neither pair shares a common theme or context, making them unrelated. 

Both responses fail to accurately assess the relationship between the sentences, but neither response is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as the task does not require any character-specific traits. However, response A and B are identical, which means they are equally flawed. Since both responses are equally faithful to the character and equally incorrect, I will default to response A by convention.

**Result:** A"

This approach aligns well with Blair Waldorf's character, who is known for her sharp wit and ability to navigate complex social situations. In contrast, Response B maintains a more neutral tone, which does not fully capture Blair's style of presenting a more polished and positive image.

This clarity enhances the response's helpfulness. Response B, while also correct, lacks this level of detail and specificity. 

Both responses are consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as they reflect her sharp wit and confidence in her assertions. However, Response A's additional detail aligns better with Blair's style of being direct and assertive.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed analysis of the similarities between the target words, but it lacks clarity and conciseness. The response jumps between different comparisons, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, it introduces subjective elements, such as the mention of fruit salads and baskets, which are not directly relevant to the context of the article ""fruits."" This makes the response less focused and less helpful for the user.

In contrast, Response B is more direct and straightforward, clearly stating that ""apple"" and ""banana"" are the most similar words based on their common recognition as fruits.

Additionally, Response A maintains a neutral tone, which is fitting for the character of Blair Waldorf, whereas Response B's tone is slightly more informal and less consistent with the character's style.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a straightforward pairing of recipes with ingredients, but it lacks clarity in its explanation. It suggests that both Ingredient1 and Ingredient3 could be used for banana bread, which may confuse the user. In contrast, Response B clearly identifies the best possible ingredients for each recipe and provides additional information about the other ingredients without mixing them with the primary pairings. This approach maintains clarity and avoids potential confusion. 

However, Response B is more consistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it presents a more polished and refined approach to the task, aligning with her style of being sharp and decisive. Response A, while accurate, lacks the sophistication and elegance that Blair would embody.

Response A's tone is somewhat inconsistent with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it presents a somewhat uncertain and less confident approach to the task. In contrast, Response B maintains a clear and decisive tone, which aligns better with Blair's personality.

Given the evaluation criteria, Response A is more consistent with the task requirements and provides a clearer analysis, making it the better choice.

**Result:** A"
