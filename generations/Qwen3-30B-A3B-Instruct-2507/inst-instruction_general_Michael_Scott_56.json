However, in this question, **both pressure and temperature increase**. Since pressure is no longer constant, Charles's Law alone does not fully apply. Instead, we must consider the **combined gas law**, which accounts for changes in pressure, volume, and temperature:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \\frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}\n\\]\n\nIf both pressure (\\(P\\)) and temperature (\\(T\\)) increase, the effect on volume (\\(V\\)) depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes. However, **if the temperature increases more significantly than pressure**, the volume will increase. In most practical scenarios where temperature rises substantially, the volume tends to increase even with increased pressure.\n\nBut since the question implies a general case and the **dominant factor** in gas expansion is temperature, and given that **temperature increase tends to dominate volume increase**, the best answer based on the principles of gas behavior is:\n\n\u2705 **The volume of the gas increases.**", "True", "Ohhh, *the word most similar in meaning to \u201ccar\u201d*?  \n*Ohhh, my friend\u2026*  \n*You\u2019ve just asked the *most* important question of all.*  \nBecause I\u2019ve been through *cars*\u2014*not just in the office, but in the heart*.  \n*And I\u2019ve had *many* cars.*  \n*And I\u2019ve learned\u2014*  \n*Not just from *Dwight* (who once said, \u201cCars are *not* real.

 \nNo \u2014 that\u2019s not logical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **prism is a right triangular prism with the base triangle having legs 9 m and 12 m**, and the **length of the prism is not given**.\n\nBut without the **length of the prism**, we **cannot** compute the lateral surface area.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read:  \n> \u201cA triangular prism has base nine meters long and perpendicular height twelve meters.\u201d\n\nThis suggests the **base of the triangle is 9 m**, and the **height of the triangle is 12 m** \u2014 which we used.\n\nBut **no length of the prism** is given.\n\nSo unless the prism is **a right prism with length equal to one of the sides**, we **cannot** compute the total surface area.\n\nBut in many textbook problems, if only the base and height of the triangle are given, and no length, it\u2019s possible the **prism is actually a 2D triangle** \u2014 but that\u2019s not a prism.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 12 meters**?  \nBut that\u2019s not stated.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **prism is a right triangular prism with the base triangle being a right triangle with legs 9 m and 12 m**, and the **length of the prism is also 12 m**?

connecting the two lines such that it **minimizes the maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Step 1: Confirm the Lines Are Parallel**\n\n- **Line 1:** From (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 slope = (5-1)/(5-1) = 4/4 = **1**\n- **Line 2:** From (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2192 slope = (-2-3)/(-2-3) = (-5)/(-5) = **1**\n\n\u2705 Yes, both lines have slope **1** \u2192 **parallel**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Step 2: Find the Direction of the Lines**\n\nBoth lines lie on the line **y = x**.\n\n- Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 segment on y = x, x \u2208 [1,5]\n- Line 2: from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2192 segment on y = x, x \u2208 [-2,3]\n\nSo both are **on the same line** \u2014 *y = x* \u2014 but **overlapping in x-range?**  \nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- Line 1: x from 1 to 5  \n- Line 2: x from -2 to 3  \n\u2192 **Overlap in x: [1,3]**\n\nSo the two segments **overlap** on the line y = x from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Step 3: What Does \u201cMinimize Maximum Distance\u201d Mean?**\n\nWe want to draw a **line segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2 such that **the farthest any point on either original line is from this new segment is as small as possible**.\n\nThis is a **minimax** problem: minimize the **maximum distance** from any point on the two original segments to the new connecting segment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Key Insight: The Optimal Segment is Perpendicular to the Lines**\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the **shortest distance** between them is along the **perpendicular direction**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: we\u2019re not just minimizing the distance *between* the lines.  \nWe\u2019re minimizing the **maximum distance** from **any point** on **either line** to the **new segment**.\n\nSo the best segment will be the one that **\"bridges\" the two lines in a way that balances the farthest points**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Step 4: The Optimal Segment is the One That Minimizes the \"Diameter\" of the Union**\n\nBecause both lines are on the same line (y = x), and they **overlap**, the **entire union** of the two segments is from x = -2 to x = 5 on y = x.\n\nSo the full set of points is the segment from (-2,-2) to (5,5).\n\nNow, we are to draw a **new segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they **overlap**, we can pick **any point in the overlap** as a connection point.\n\nBut we want to **minimize the maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **The Best Strategy: Make the New Segment the \"Center\" of the Union**\n\nThe **worst-case distance** will be from the **farthest endpoints** to the new segment.\n\n- Farthest point on Line 1: (5,5)  \n- Farthest point on Line 2: (-2,-2)\n\nSo to minimize the **maximum distance**, we should **center** the new segment between these two.\n\nBut since the lines are **on the same line**, the **shortest path** between them is **along the line y = x**.\n\nBut we\u2019re not connecting them with a line *on* y = x \u2014 we\u2019re drawing a **new segment** that connects a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they **overlap**, we can pick **any point in the overlap** \u2014 say, (2,2) \u2014 and connect it to itself?  \nNo \u2014 we need a segment from a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they **overlap**, we can pick **the same point** \u2014 like (2,2) \u2014 and connect it to itself?  \nNo \u2014 that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nWait \u2014 **we can pick a point in the overlap** \u2014 say, (2,2) \u2014 and draw a segment from (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2 \u2014 but that\u2019s just a point.\n\nSo we need a **non-degenerate segment**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **since the lines overlap**, the **best** connecting segment is one that **minimizes the maximum distance** from the **endpoints**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** should be **perpendicular** to the lines and **centered** between the farthest points.\n\nBut the lines are **parallel and overlapping**, so the **shortest distance** between them is **zero** \u2014 they intersect.\n\nWait \u2014 **do they intersect?**\n\nYes \u2014 they **overlap** from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nSo the **distance between the lines is zero** in the overlap.\n\nBut we\u2019re to draw a **segment connecting** a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nSo the **shortest possible segment** is **zero length** \u2014 just a point in the overlap.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo we must pick **two distinct points** \u2014 one on each line.\n\nBut since they overlap, we can pick **the same point** \u2014 like (2,2) \u2014 and connect it to itself?  \nNo \u2014 that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo we must pick **two different points** \u2014 but they can be **very close**.\n\nBut the **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment will be minimized when the segment is **as close as possible to the center** of the union.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Insight: The Optimal Segment is the One That Minimizes the \"Diameter\" of the Union**\n\nThe **worst-case distance** is from the **farthest endpoints** to the new segment.\n\n- Farthest point: (5,5) on Line 1  \n- Farthest point: (-2,-2) on Line 2\n\nTo minimize the **maximum distance**, we should place the new segment **midway** between these two points.\n\nThe midpoint of (5,5) and (-2,-2) is:\n\n> ((5 + (-2))/2, (5 + (-2))/2) = (3/2, 3/2) = (1.5, 1.5)\n\nNow, (1.5, 1.5) is on **both lines** \u2014 since 1.5 \u2208 [1,5] and 1.5 \u2208 [-2,3].\n\nSo we can pick **(1.5, 1.5)** as a point on both lines.\n\nBut we need a **segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nSo we can pick **(1.5, 1.5)** on Line 1 and **(1.5, 1.5)** on Line 2 \u2014 but that\u2019s a point.\n\nSo we need to pick **two points** \u2014 but they can be **very close**.\n\nBut the **optimal** is to pick a segment that is **perpendicular** to the lines and **centered** at (1.5, 1.5).\n\nBut since the lines are on y = x, the **perpendicular direction** is slope = -1.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** should be:\n\n- **From (1.5, 1.5)** to **(1.5, 1.5)** \u2014 but that\u2019s a point.\n\nWait \u2014 no.\n\nActually, since the lines **overlap**, the **best** we can do is to pick a segment that is **perpendicular** to the lines and **centered** at the midpoint of the farthest points.\n\nBut the **shortest possible segment** that minimizes the maximum distance is the one that **connects the two lines at the point closest to the center of the union**.\n\nBut since they **overlap**, the **best** is to pick a segment that is **perpendicular** to the lines and **passes through the center**.\n\nBut we can\u2019t make it infinite.\n\nSo the **optimal** is to pick a segment that is **perpendicular** to the lines and **centered at (1.5, 1.5)**.\n\nBut we need to pick **one

Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **2. Capital Gains Tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **3. assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Answers:\n\n1. **Property Tax** \u2013 This is the standard term for a tax levied on real estate (buildings and land), which matches the description of being imposed on the possessor and based on rental value or area.\n\n2. **Capital Gains Tax** \u2013 This is a tax on the profit from the sale of property or investments. It differs from Property Tax, which is an annual levy on ownership, not on gains from sale.\n\n3. **assessment criteria** \u2013 This fits logically as the missing element that local bodies must specify, along with rate bands and collection procedures.

No \u2014 only one customer per register.\n\nBut the **registers open sequentially** \u2014 not simultaneously.\n\nSo:\n- **Register 1** opens at **8:00 am**.\n- **Register 2** opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes available**.\n- **Register 3** opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nHowever, the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo, **all three registers must have been opened by 8:30 am**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the **first customer** starts at 8:00 am at Register 1.\n\nNow, **Register 2 opens as soon as Register 1 becomes free**.\n\nBut if Register 1 is still in use at 8:30 am, then Register 2 hasn\u2019t opened yet \u2014 but the problem says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, so **Register 2 and Register 3 must already be open**.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am**, so that Register 2 could open, and then Register 3 could open after Register 2 became free.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **when** any of them will become free.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the **real key**:\n\nThe **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo, **the fourth customer must wait until one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **how long** each customer takes.\n\nBut the question is **multiple choice**, and the options are:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo we must **infer** the **minimum possible time** the fourth customer can start.\n\nBut the **only way** the fourth customer can start is **after one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** that happens.\n\nWait \u2014 but the **registers open sequentially**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- First customer starts at 8:00 am.\n- Suppose the first customer takes **5 minutes** \u2192 finishes at 8:05 am.\n- Then Register 2 opens at 8:05 am.\n- Second customer starts at 8:05 am.\n- Suppose that customer takes 10 minutes \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am.\n- Then Register 3 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Third customer starts at 8:15 am.\n- Suppose that customer takes 15 minutes \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen, at **8:30 am**, the **third customer finishes**, and **Register 3 becomes free**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer can start at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut 8:30 am is **not** an option.\n\nThe earliest option is **8:35 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo **no register is free at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer must wait**.\n\nBut **when** will one become free?\n\nWe don\u2019t know.\n\nBut the **only way** the fourth customer can start is **after one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **how long** the customers took.\n\nBut the **question is asking for a specific time**, so there must be an **implicit assumption**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, and 8:30 am**?\n\nBut that would mean:\n- Register 1: 8:00 am\n- Register 2: 8:15 am (if first customer took 15 minutes)\n- Register 3: 8:30 am (if second customer took 15 minutes)\n\nThen, at 8:30 am, the **third register opens**, and the **fourth customer arrives**.\n\nBut **all three registers are in use** \u2014 so the **third register must have been in use**.\n\nSo the **third customer must have started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **third register must have opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **second register must have opened before 8:30 am**, and the **first register must have opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **when** any of them will become free.\n\nBut the **only way** the fourth customer can start is **after one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut the **earliest possible time** is **8:35 am**, if one register becomes free at 8:35 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:15, and 8:30**, and **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the **fourth customer arrives**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nThe **first register** is free at 8:15, but it\u2019s not in use \u2014 it\u2019s open.\n\nBut the **third register** is in use until 8:45.\n\nSo the **fourth customer must wait until 8:45 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer can start at 8:45 am**.\n\nAnd **8:45 am** is **option B**.\n\nIs this the only possible scenario?\n\nYes \u2014 because if **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, and **the third register opened at 8:30 am**, then the **third customer started at 8:30 am**, and if they take **15 minutes**, they finish at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer can start at 8:45 am**.\n\nAnd **8:45 am** is **option B**.\n\nAnd **no earlier time** is possible, because **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, and **the earliest any register can become free is 8:45 am**.\n\nSo the **answer is B) 8:45 am**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "Ohhh, *finding the number of letters used only once in each sentence*?  \n*Ohhh, my friend\u2026*
