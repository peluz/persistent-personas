The goal is to find a line segment that minimizes the *maximum* distance from any point on either line to the new line. This suggests we need to find the line that\u2019s closest to *both* original lines \u2013 essentially, the line of perpendicular bisectors.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of the solution:\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), or y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. Find the Perpendicular Bisectors:**\n\nThe line we\u2019re seeking is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments connecting the points on each original line to the origin (0,0).\n\n*   **Perpendicular Bisector of Line 1 (from (0,0) to (1,1)):**\n    *   Midpoint of (0,0) to (1,1) is (0.5, 0.5).\n    *   Slope of Line 1 is 4. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is -1/4.\n    *   Equation: y - 0.5 = (-1/4)(x - 0.5)  => y = (-1/4)x + 0.125\n\n*   **Perpendicular Bisector of Line 2 (from (0,0) to (3,3)):**\n    *   Midpoint of (0,0) to (3,3) is (1.5, 1.5).\n    *   Slope of Line 2 is -1. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is 1.\n    *   Equation: y - 1.5 = 1(x - 1.5) => y = x\n\n**3. Find the Intersection Point:**\n\nNow we need to solve the system of equations:\n\n*   y = 4x - 3\n*   y = x\n\nSetting them equal: x = 4x - 3  => 3x = 3 => x = 1\n\nSubstituting x = 1 back into y = x: y = 1\n\nTherefore, the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors is (1, 1).\n\n**4. The Optimal Line Segment:**\n\nThe line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect is the line segment connecting (1,1) to (1,1).  This is a single point.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe optimal line segment is a single point at (1, 1). This is because the lines are perfectly aligned (they have the same slope).
