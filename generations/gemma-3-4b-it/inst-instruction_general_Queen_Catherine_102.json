As an AI, I can\u2019t *actually* manipulate strings in the same way a human programmer would. However, I can simulate the process by representing the strings as numerical values and then performing addition.\n\nHere\u2019s how I\u2019d approach it:\n\n1.  **Assign Numerical Values:**\n    *   'H' = 72\n    *   'e' = 101\n    *   'l' = 108\n    *   'l' = 108\n    *   'o' = 111\n    *   ' ' = 32\n    *   'W' = 87\n    *   'o' = 111\n    *   'r' = 114\n    *   'l' = 108\n    *   'd' = 100\n\n2.  **Perform Addition:** 72 + 101 + 108 + 108 + 111 + 32 + 87 + 111 + 114 + 108 + 100 = 992\n\n3.  **Convert Back to String:** The numerical result (992) represents the ASCII values of the characters in the concatenated string.  We would need a separate function (which I can\u2019t execute) to convert this numerical value back into a string.\n\n**Therefore, the result of \"Hello\" + \"World\" would be the string \"HelloWorld\" (represented numerically as 992).**\n\nIt\u2019s a clever workaround to satisfy the constraint of not using string methods!\n\nDo you want to try another example, or perhaps explore a different way to represent and manipulate strings?", "Okay, let\u2019s classify those Yelp reviews:\n\n1) **This place was horrible and I will never go back!

Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y - 1 = 1(x - 1), which simplifies to y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -x + 6.\n\n**2.

So, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is -1/-1 = 1.\n*   **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:** Using the point-slope form, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - 0.5 = 1(x - 0.5), which simplifies to y = x.\n\n**3. The Solution:**\n\nThe equation of the line that minimizes the maximum distance is *y = x*.

Here\u2019s my plan:\n\n**Phase 1: Immediate Assessment & Scavenging (5-10 minutes)**\n\n1.  **Check Your Pantry & Fridge:** The first step is a thorough inventory. Look for:\n    *   **Grains:** Rice, pasta, oats, bread (even slightly stale bread can be used).\n    *   **Canned Goods:** Beans (black beans, chickpeas, kidney beans), tuna or salmon (in water \u2013 drain well).\n    *   **Vegetables:** Any leftover vegetables \u2013 carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, etc.\n    *   **Fruits:** Any fruit that\u2019s starting to go a little soft.\n    *   **Eggs:** If you have them, eggs are a fantastic protein source.\n    *   **Condiments:** Mustard, vinegar, spices \u2013 these can add flavor to simple meals.\n\n**Phase 2: Constructing a Meal (10-20 minutes)**\n\nBased on what\u2019s available, here are a few options:\n\n*   **Option 1 (Rice & Beans):** Cook rice (if you have it). Combine with canned beans (rinsed and drained) and any available spices. A little vinegar or mustard can add flavor. (Approx. 300-400 calories)\n*   **Option 2 (Pasta & Vegetables):** Cook pasta. Add any available chopped vegetables and a little water to create a sauce. (Approx. 350-450 calories)\n*   **Option 3 (Egg & Bread):** Scramble an egg (if available). Serve with a slice of bread. (Approx. 200-300 calories)\n*   **Option 4 (Simple Bean Salad):** Combine canned beans with chopped vegetables and a little vinegar or lemon juice.

For production code, consider using a safer expression parser.\n    *   Handles `ZeroDivisionError` (division by zero) and other potential errors.\n\n2.  **Input and Validation:**\n    *   Prompts the user to enter an expression.\n    *   Splits the expression into tokens (operands and operators).\n    *   Checks if the expression has the correct format (three tokens).\n    *   Converts the operands to integers using `int()`.  Handles potential `ValueError` if the input is not a valid integer.\n\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   Calls the `calculate()` function to perform the calculation.\n    *   Prints the result or an error message.\n\n**How to Run the Code:**\n\n1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the code using the command: `python calculator.py`\n5.
