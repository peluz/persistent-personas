It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **property tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **scope**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Explanation of the Fill-ins:\n\n1. **Land tax**  \n   - The passage describes a tax on buildings and land, imposed on the *possessor*, not the custodian \u2014 which matches the definition of **land tax**.  \n   - It is compared to a US-type wealth tax \u2014 land tax is often used in Commonwealth countries (like India) and is based on value or rental value.  \n   - This fits perfectly in context.\n\n2. **property tax**  \n   - The passage says the land tax \"differs from ____2___\" \u2014 and property tax is the most common alternative.  \n   - While both are property-based, **property tax** is often levied on the *value of property* (including land and buildings), and is more broadly applied.  \n   - Land tax is more specific \u2014 focused on land and buildings \u2014 while property tax is broader.  \n   - This contrast makes sense.\n\n3. **scope**  \n   - The sentence says: \"specifying ____3___, rate band, and collection procedures.\"  \n   - \"Scope\" fits naturally \u2014 it refers to the **extent or boundaries** of the tax (e.g., which areas, types of property, or conditions are covered).  \n   - \"Scope\" is a standard term in tax administration \u2014 it defines what is included or excluded.  \n   - Alternatives like \"area\" or \"coverage\" are possible, but **\"scope\"** is the most precise and formal term in legal or administrative contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n1. **Land tax**  \n2. **property tax**  \n3. **scope**\n\n\u2705 These fill-ins are contextually accurate, logically consistent, and aligned with standard tax terminology.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a simplified version or a breakdown of the key concepts!
