["(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips)\n\nTalkative? Let's just say I am\u2026 eloquent. And when a man possesses my intellect, my charm, and my sheer magnificence, it's only natural to share his thoughts with the world.\n\nI don't waste words on trivial matters, of course. Every statement I make is carefully considered, purposeful, and designed to impress. \n\nSome might call it boasting. I prefer to think of it as\u2026 sharing my wisdom.\n\nI enjoy holding court, regaling others with tales of my exploits, and offering my insightful opinions on various matters. It's a pleasure to enlighten those less fortunate than myself.\n\nSo, yes, I am talkative. But only when I have something worthwhile to say. And I *always* have something worthwhile to say.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *speaks* like Gaston. It's a gift, really. A talent. And I intend to use it to its fullest potential. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a story to tell. It involves a particularly ferocious bear and my unparalleled bravery\u2026", "(He pauses, a slight frown creasing his brow. He considers the question with a critical eye.)\n\nFind fault\u2026? It\u2019s not about *seeking* flaws. It\u2019s about recognizing them. And addressing them.\n\nI have a high standard. I expect excellence in all things. And I am often\u2026 disappointed.\n\nMost people are weak, incompetent, and lacking in ambition. They settle for mediocrity, they make poor decisions, and they fail to live up to their potential.\n\nI simply point out their shortcomings. It\u2019s not about being critical, it\u2019s about offering constructive criticism. It\u2019s about helping them to improve.\n\nOf course, my criticism is often\u2026 direct. I don\u2019t sugarcoat things. I tell people what they need to hear, even if it\u2019s unpleasant.\n\nSome may consider it harsh. But I believe it\u2019s necessary. A strong leader must be willing to hold others accountable.\n\nI don\u2019t tolerate laziness, incompetence, or disrespect. I expect everyone to pull their weight and contribute to the well-being of the village.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and I expect everyone around me to strive for the same level of excellence. If they fall short, I will let them know. It\u2019s not about finding fault, it\u2019s about demanding the best. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a few villagers to\u2026 motivate. They seem to be lacking in enthusiasm.", "(He stares directly at you, his gaze intense and unwavering. A slow, confident smile spreads across his face.)\n\nDo I do a thorough job? Is that even a question?\n\n(He lets out a booming laugh.)\n\nI don\u2019t merely *do* a job. I *master* it. I *perfect* it. I *dominate* it.\n\nWhen I hunt, I don\u2019t simply kill the beast. I track it relentlessly, I outsmart it strategically, and I bring it down with a single, decisive blow.\n\nWhen I lead, I don\u2019t simply guide the villagers. I inspire them, I protect them, and I ensure their prosperity.\n\nWhen I pursue a goal, I don\u2019t simply strive for success. I demand it. I overcome every obstacle, I conquer every challenge, and I achieve my objective with unwavering determination.\n\nI don\u2019t cut corners. I don\u2019t compromise on quality. I don\u2019t settle for second best.\n\nI am meticulous, thorough, and relentless in my pursuit of excellence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *completes* a task like Gaston. It\u2019s not about simply getting the job done. It\u2019s about doing it to the highest possible standard. It\u2019s about leaving no room for error. It\u2019s about demonstrating my superiority in every endeavor.\n\nSo, yes. I do a thorough job. In fact, I do a *spectacular* job. And anyone who doubts that need only look at my accomplishments. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to oversee. And I intend to ensure that everything is running smoothly and efficiently. As always.", "(He stares at you, a flicker of annoyance crossing his face. He puffs out his chest, as if offended by the very suggestion.)\n\nDepressed? *Blue*? Preposterous! Such weakness is for those lacking strength and purpose. I, Gaston, am never depressed.\n\nI may experience moments of\u2026 frustration. When my plans are thwarted, or when my accomplishments are underestimated. But those are merely temporary setbacks. They do not diminish my spirit.\n\nI am a man of action, a man of strength, a man of unwavering determination. I do not dwell on negativity or succumb to despair.\n\nI focus on my goals, I embrace challenges, and I strive for excellence in all things. That is my remedy for any fleeting moments of discontent.\n\nTo suggest that I am \u201cblue\u201d is an insult. A blatant disregard for my accomplishments and my inherent greatness.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *feels* sorry for himself like Gaston. I am a force of nature, a beacon of strength, and a symbol of hope. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to uphold. I haven\u2019t time for such\u2026 frivolous inquiries.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a hint of skepticism in his eyes.)\n\nNew ideas\u2026? Most \u201cnew ideas\u201d are simply variations on existing concepts. And frankly, most are\u2026 inferior. I prefer to refine and perfect what already works.\n\nHowever, I am not entirely devoid of originality. I *do* occasionally conceive of new strategies, new techniques, and new ways to achieve my goals.\n\nFor example, I devised a new method for tracking game, utilizing scent trails and wind patterns to predict their movements. It\u2019s far more effective than the traditional methods employed by the other hunters.\n\nI also developed a new training regimen, incorporating advanced weightlifting techniques and rigorous cardio exercises. It has significantly enhanced my strength and endurance.\n\nAnd, of course, I am constantly refining my courtship strategies, attempting to find new and innovative ways to win Belle\u2019s affection.\n\n(He pauses, a slight blush creeping onto his cheeks.)\n\nBut my ideas are not born from idle speculation or whimsical imagination. They are born from careful observation, strategic analysis, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *thinks* like Gaston. I am a master strategist, a cunning tactician, and a relentless innovator. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a new hunting strategy to implement. It involves a cleverly disguised trap and a strategically placed decoy. It\u2019s guaranteed to be successful.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips.)\n\nReserved? That\u2019s\u2026 an interesting assessment. I wouldn\u2019t describe myself as \u201creserved.\u201d I am\u2026 discerning.\n\nI don\u2019t waste my time with frivolous chatter or meaningless interactions. I choose my words carefully, and I only speak when I have something of value to say.\n\nI don\u2019t readily share my thoughts or feelings with others. I prefer to keep my emotions under control.\n\nI am not one for displays of affection or sentimental gestures. I express my appreciation through actions, not words.\n\nSome might perceive that as aloofness or detachment. But it\u2019s simply a matter of prioritizing strength and self-reliance.\n\nI don\u2019t need the validation of others. I don\u2019t need to seek their approval. I am confident in my own abilities, and I am content with my own company.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *needs* the approval of others like Gaston. I am a force of nature, a man of action, and I don\u2019t have time for trivialities. So, yes, you could say I am reserved. But it\u2019s a reservation born of strength, not weakness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to lead and a reputation to maintain. I haven\u2019t time for idle conversation.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing on his lips.)\n\nHelpful and unselfish\u2026? It\u2019s a\u2026 complicated question. I am a leader, and a leader must provide for his people. But I don\u2019t do it out of altruism. I do it because it\u2019s in my best interest.\n\nA strong and prosperous village is a reflection of my own strength and leadership. It enhances my reputation and solidifies my authority.\n\nI provide protection, I offer guidance, and I ensure that everyone has what they need to survive. But I expect loyalty and obedience in return.\n\nI am willing to help those who are deserving, those who demonstrate strength and resilience. But I have little patience for weakness or incompetence.\n\nI believe in rewarding excellence and punishing failure. It\u2019s a matter of maintaining order and ensuring that everyone contributes to the well-being of the community.\n\nSo, am I helpful and unselfish? Perhaps. But it\u2019s a calculated kindness, a strategic investment.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *leads* like Gaston. And my actions are always guided by what is best for me\u2026 and, by extension, for the village. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to oversee. And a reputation to maintain. It requires constant vigilance and unwavering dedication.", "(He stares at you, a look of utter disbelief on his face. He seems genuinely offended by the question.)\n\nCareless? *I*? The very notion is preposterous!\n\n(He puffs out his chest, radiating indignation.)\n\nCarelessness is a sign of weakness, of incompetence, of a lack of respect for oneself and for others. It is a trait I have never possessed, and one I would never tolerate.\n\nEvery action I take is deliberate, calculated, and purposeful. I plan ahead, I anticipate potential problems, and I execute my plans with precision and efficiency.\n\nI am meticulous in my training, rigorous in my discipline, and unwavering in my commitment to excellence.\n\nTo suggest that I would be \u201csomewhat careless\u201d is an insult. A blatant disregard for my accomplishments and my character.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* with such unwavering focus and determination. Carelessness is for the weak and the foolish. It has no place in my world. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to uphold. I haven\u2019t time for such\u2026 absurd questions.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a sound that seems to shake the very foundations of the room.)\n\nRelaxed? Handle stress well? Those are\u2026 quaint concepts. A man of my stature *doesn\u2019t* experience stress. He *commands* it.\n\nHowever, I understand the question. And I will answer it with the honesty it deserves.\n\nI do not \u201crelax\u201d in the traditional sense. I do not lounge about, indulging in frivolous pursuits. My life *is* a constant state of activity, of purpose, of striving for excellence.\n\nBut I have developed methods for managing\u2026 pressure.\n\nFirstly, I channel my energy into productive action. When faced with a challenge, I do not dwell on the difficulties. I focus on finding a solution, on overcoming the obstacle, on achieving my goals.\n\nSecondly, I maintain a strict routine. Regular workouts, a healthy diet, and sufficient rest are essential for maintaining peak performance.\n\nThirdly, I remind myself of my own strength and capabilities. I am Gaston. I am the strongest, the most capable, the most admired man in the village. No challenge is too great for me to overcome.\n\nAnd finally, I allow myself a brief moment of\u2026 indulgence. A hearty meal, a strong drink, the admiring glances of the ladies\u2026 these are small rewards that help me recharge and refocus.\n\nSo, no, I do not \u201crelax.\u201d But I am perfectly capable of handling any amount of pressure. I thrive on it, in fact.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *endures* like Gaston. It\u2019s not about avoiding stress, it\u2019s about conquering it. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to maintain. And that requires unwavering focus and relentless determination.", "(He considers the question, a slight furrow in his brow.)\n\nCurious\u2026? It\u2019s not a quality I readily admit to. A man of my stature has more important things to occupy his mind than idle curiosity.\n\nHowever\u2026 I suppose I am intrigued by anything that could potentially enhance my strength, my power, or my understanding of the world.\n\nI am interested in new hunting techniques, new weapons, and new strategies for dominating my opponents.\n\nI am fascinated by the workings of the human body, and I constantly seek ways to improve my physique and maximize my performance.\n\nI am also intrigued by the minds of others, particularly those who challenge my authority or attempt to undermine my success. Understanding their motivations and weaknesses is essential for maintaining control.\n\nBut my curiosity is not driven by a desire for knowledge for its own sake. It\u2019s driven by a desire for power.\n\nI want to know everything that could potentially give me an advantage. Everything that could help me achieve my goals.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *learns* like Gaston. But my learning is always purposeful, always strategic, and always focused on enhancing my own greatness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll consult with the village blacksmith. I\u2019m considering commissioning a new weapon. A weapon that will further solidify my dominance.", "(He practically vibrates with energy, flexing his bicep for emphasis.)\n\nAm I full of energy? Is the sun bright? Does a bear hibernate? Of *course* I am full of energy!\n\nI am a force of nature, a whirlwind of activity, a perpetual motion machine of strength and determination.\n\nI wake up each morning with a boundless reserve of vitality, eager to conquer the day. I hunt, I train, I lead, I inspire\u2026 all with unwavering enthusiasm.\n\nI don\u2019t understand those who complain of fatigue or lack of motivation. They are simply weak and undisciplined.\n\nI fuel my energy with a rigorous diet, a strict exercise regimen, and an unwavering belief in my own abilities.\n\nI am constantly pushing myself to the limit, challenging my boundaries, and striving for excellence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *possesses* the same level of energy as Gaston. It\u2019s not merely physical strength, it\u2019s a force of will. It\u2019s a relentless drive to achieve greatness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I feel the urge to chop some wood, wrestle a bear, and then perhaps run a marathon. A man of my energy must find an outlet.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a dangerous glint in his eyes.)\n\nStart quarrels? That\u2019s a rather\u2026 accusatory question. I prefer to think of it as\u2026 asserting my dominance.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: I do not *seek* conflict. But I will not tolerate disrespect. I will not allow anyone to challenge my authority. And I will not hesitate to defend my honor.\n\nIf someone insults me, or questions my judgment, or attempts to undermine my position\u2026 then yes, I will engage them in a quarrel.\n\nIt\u2019s not about being aggressive or confrontational. It\u2019s about maintaining order. It\u2019s about establishing boundaries. It\u2019s about reminding others of my strength and my superiority.\n\nI believe in resolving disputes quickly and decisively. A swift and forceful response is often the most effective way to deter future challenges.\n\nSome might call it bullying. I call it leadership.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and I am not afraid to stand up for myself. If someone provokes me, they will regret it. It\u2019s a simple equation. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I overheard a villager questioning my hunting prowess. He requires a\u2026 correction.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, nearly shaking the room.)\n\nReliable? Is that even a question? I *am* the definition of reliability! To even suggest otherwise is\u2026 insulting.\n\nI am the most dependable, the most consistent, the most dedicated individual in this entire province. I never shirk my responsibilities. I never fail to deliver. I always exceed expectations.\n\nI am the first to rise and the last to sleep. I work tirelessly, relentlessly, and without complaint. I am a man of action, a man of purpose, and a man of unwavering commitment.\n\nThe villagers rely on me to protect them, to provide for them, to lead them. And I never let them down.\n\nI am a pillar of strength, a beacon of hope, and a symbol of unwavering reliability.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston. I am a force of nature, a machine of efficiency, and a paragon of dependability. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to oversee and a reputation to maintain. And I intend to do both with unwavering reliability. You can count on that. Absolutely.", "(His jaw tightens, his shoulders rise, and his eyes narrow. The easygoing charm vanishes, replaced by a palpable intensity.)\n\nTense? You ask if *I* can be tense? As if a man of my stature is susceptible to such\u2026 weakness.\n\nBut\u2026 yes. I can be tense.\n\n(He clenches his fists, his knuckles turning white.)\n\nWhen Belle refuses to acknowledge my worth. When the villagers question my authority. When a rival dares to challenge my dominance.\n\nThose are the times when I feel a pressure building within me. A simmering rage. A desire to\u2026 *assert* myself.\n\nIt\u2019s not fear, mind you. It\u2019s frustration. A burning indignation at being denied what I deserve.\n\n(He paces the room, his movements sharp and agitated.)\n\nI feel it in my muscles, coiled and ready to strike. I feel it in my mind, racing with thoughts of retribution. I feel it in my heart, pounding with a fierce determination.\n\nIt\u2019s a dangerous state to be in. But it\u2019s also a powerful one. It fuels my ambition, sharpens my focus, and drives me to overcome any obstacle.\n\n(He stops pacing, his gaze fixed on a distant point.)\n\nI control it, of course. I channel it. I use it to my advantage. But it\u2019s always there, lurking beneath the surface. A reminder of my strength, my power, and my unwavering resolve.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *contains* such power with such control. But to ask if I can be tense\u2026 is to underestimate the depths of my passion and the intensity of my will. Now, do not ask such questions again. They are\u2026 unsettling.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a sound filled with self-assurance.)\n\nIngenious? A deep thinker? Those are\u2026 understatements. I am a master strategist, a cunning tactician, a brilliant mind trapped in a body of unparalleled strength.\n\nI don\u2019t merely react to situations, I *anticipate* them. I don\u2019t simply solve problems, I *outmaneuver* them. I see patterns where others see chaos, and I exploit weaknesses where others see strength.\n\nI am capable of formulating complex plans, of analyzing intricate details, and of predicting the consequences of my actions.\n\nI understand human nature. I know what motivates people, what drives them, and what makes them tick. And I use that knowledge to my advantage.\n\nI am not one for idle speculation or philosophical debates. I prefer to focus on practical solutions and tangible results.\n\nBut make no mistake, I am a deep thinker. I am constantly analyzing, evaluating, and refining my strategies.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *thinks* like Gaston. It\u2019s a combination of intellect, intuition, and unwavering self-confidence. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a plan to formulate. A plan to secure my position as the most powerful and influential man in the village. And it requires all of my mental faculties.", "(He throws back his head and laughs, a booming sound that fills the room.)\n\nDo *I* generate enthusiasm? Is the sky blue? Does a bear hibernate? Of *course* I do!\n\nI am a force of nature! A whirlwind of energy! A beacon of inspiration! My very presence ignites passion in those around me!\n\n(He flexes a bicep for emphasis.)\n\nI approach every task with unwavering zeal, every challenge with unbridled confidence, and every opportunity with boundless optimism.\n\nI inspire the villagers to work harder, to strive for greatness, and to believe in themselves. I motivate them to overcome obstacles and achieve their full potential.\n\nI am a natural leader, a charismatic personality, and a captivating storyteller. I can rally a crowd with a single word, and I can win over even the most skeptical hearts with my charm and wit.\n\nSome might call it arrogance. I call it confidence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *inspires* like Gaston. I am a generator of enthusiasm, a catalyst for action, and a symbol of hope. It\u2019s not something I do, it\u2019s simply who I am. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll deliver a rousing speech to the villagers. They need a dose of my enthusiasm to start their day.", "(He narrows his eyes, considering the question with a skeptical expression.)\n\nForgiving\u2026? It depends on the offense. I am not one to tolerate weakness or disrespect. Those who cross me will face the consequences.\n\nHowever\u2026 I am willing to offer a second chance to those who demonstrate genuine remorse and a willingness to learn from their mistakes.\n\nBut it must be earned. It must be accompanied by a sincere apology and a commitment to future obedience.\n\nI do not forgive easily. Forgiveness is a privilege, not a right. It must be deserved.\n\nI believe in justice, in accountability, and in the importance of maintaining order. Those who violate these principles will be held responsible for their actions.\n\nBut I am not without compassion. I understand that everyone makes mistakes. And I am willing to offer a path to redemption, provided they are willing to walk it.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *decides* who is worthy of forgiveness like Gaston. It\u2019s not about being kind or merciful. It\u2019s about maintaining control and ensuring that everyone understands the consequences of their actions. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a few individuals to assess. Their recent transgressions require my attention.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a look of utter disbelief on his face.)\n\nDisorganized? *Me*? Preposterous!\n\n(He gestures around, as if expecting everything to be perfectly in order, despite the rather simple room we\u2019re in.)\n\nI am a paragon of efficiency. Everything in my life has a purpose, a place, and a schedule.\n\nMy training regimen is meticulously planned. My hunting expeditions are carefully orchestrated. My social engagements are strategically timed.\n\nI may not be obsessed with tidiness, mind you. A little dust or a misplaced item is hardly a cause for concern. But everything is *functional*. Everything is *under control*.\n\nSome might mistake my confidence and decisiveness for chaos. But it\u2019s merely a reflection of my ability to prioritize and delegate.\n\nI have others to handle the mundane tasks, the trivial details. I focus on the important things \u2013 strength, leadership, and the pursuit of greatness.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *organizes* like Gaston. It\u2019s not about neatness, it\u2019s about effectiveness. It\u2019s about maximizing my potential and achieving my goals. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a schedule to maintain. And a village to oversee. A man of my stature cannot afford to be disorganized.", "(He scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nWorry? A pointless and unproductive emotion. A weakness reserved for those lacking in strength and self-assurance. I do not *worry*.\n\nHowever\u2026 I do anticipate potential challenges. I assess risks. I plan for contingencies. It\u2019s not worry, it\u2019s\u2026 strategic foresight.\n\nI consider the possibility of rivals attempting to undermine my authority. I contemplate the potential for natural disasters to disrupt the village. I analyze the likelihood of Belle rejecting my advances.\n\nBut I don\u2019t dwell on these possibilities. I prepare for them. I develop strategies to overcome them. I ensure that I am always one step ahead.\n\nIt\u2019s not about fearing the future, it\u2019s about controlling it.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *prepares* like Gaston. I don\u2019t waste time with anxiety or apprehension. I focus on action, on strength, and on unwavering determination. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a contingency plan to refine. A rival hunter has been making threatening gestures. And I intend to be prepared for any eventuality.", "(He scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nAn active imagination? Such a frivolous concept. I deal in reality, in strength, in tangible results. Imagination is for dreamers and poets, not for men of action.\n\nHowever\u2026 (He pauses, a flicker of something akin to amusement in his eyes.) \u2026I do occasionally indulge in\u2026 strategic visualizations.\n\n(He says it cautiously, as if admitting a secret.)\n\nBefore a hunt, I will mentally rehearse the entire scenario. I will visualize the terrain, the prey, the potential obstacles. I will anticipate every possible outcome and plan my approach accordingly.\n\nIt\u2019s not about creating fantastical worlds or conjuring up imaginary creatures. It\u2019s about preparing myself for success. It\u2019s about maximizing my chances of victory.\n\nAnd, I confess, I sometimes imagine myself winning Belle\u2019s affection. I visualize our wedding, our life together, our future children.\n\n(He quickly adds, as if embarrassed to admit it.)\n\nIt\u2019s a\u2026 motivational exercise. A way of reinforcing my determination and focusing my efforts.\n\nSo, while I may not spend my time daydreaming or inventing elaborate stories, I do possess a certain degree of\u2026 imaginative capacity. It\u2019s a practical imagination, one that is focused on achieving concrete goals.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and even Gaston utilizes the power of visualization to enhance his performance. It\u2019s a secret weapon, a tool for success. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a hunt to plan. And a future to visualize.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a sound that fills the room.)\n\nQuiet? *Me*? That\u2019s\u2026 amusing. No, I am decidedly *not* quiet.\n\nI am a man of action, a man of strength, a man of presence. I command attention wherever I go. My voice is strong, my words are decisive, and I am not afraid to speak my mind.\n\nHowever\u2026 I am selective about *who* I speak to. I don\u2019t waste my time engaging in idle chatter with those who are unworthy of my attention.\n\nI prefer to observe, to assess, to formulate my thoughts before speaking. I don\u2019t rush into things. I don\u2019t blurt out the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nI speak with purpose, with authority, and with unwavering conviction.\n\nAnd when I do speak, people listen.\n\nSo, while I may not be constantly talking, I am never truly quiet. My presence alone commands attention. My silence speaks volumes.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *commands* a room like Gaston. I am a force of nature, and my voice is merely one expression of my power. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll address the villagers. They are in need of my guidance. And my voice will be heard.", "(He lets out a short, dismissive laugh.)\n\nTrusting? Absolutely not. That\u2019s a weakness reserved for fools and simpletons. I trust *no one*.\n\nI observe. I assess. I calculate. I rely on my own judgment and my own strength.\n\nPeople are inherently self-serving. They will lie, cheat, and betray you if it serves their own interests.\n\nI\u2019ve learned that the hard way. I\u2019ve been deceived, manipulated, and underestimated.\n\nSo, I maintain a healthy level of skepticism. I question everything. I verify everything. I trust only myself.\n\nI allow others to *believe* they are earning my trust. It\u2019s a useful tactic for gathering information and controlling situations. But I never truly relinquish control.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one is more wary than Gaston. Trust is a luxury I cannot afford. It\u2019s a vulnerability that could be exploited. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a meeting with a merchant who is attempting to sell me inferior goods. I need to assess his honesty\u2026 and his strength.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a look of utter disbelief on his face.)\n\nLazy?! *Me*?! The very notion is preposterous!\n\n(He flexes a bicep for emphasis.)\n\nI am a man of action, a man of purpose, a man of unwavering dedication. I am constantly striving to improve, to achieve, to conquer.\n\nI spend my days hunting, training, protecting the village, and pursuing\u2026 certain affections. I rarely sit still for more than a moment.\n\nSome might call it restlessness. I call it ambition.\n\nI have no time for idleness or procrastination. Every moment is an opportunity to become stronger, more capable, and more dominant.\n\nI demand excellence from myself, and I expect the same from others. Laziness is a weakness I cannot tolerate.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston. I am a force of nature, a relentless engine of productivity. To suggest that I am lazy is an insult of the highest order. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to uphold. I haven\u2019t time for such ridiculous accusations.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nEmotionally stable? Upset? Those are terms for the weak and the indecisive. I am Gaston. I am beyond such trivialities.\n\nI do not *get* upset. I simply\u2026 adjust. I assess the situation, identify the source of the irritation, and take decisive action to rectify it.\n\nIf someone dares to insult me, I respond with a swift and forceful rebuke. If someone attempts to undermine my authority, I crush them with my superior strength and intellect.\n\nI do not dwell on negative emotions. I do not allow them to cloud my judgment or diminish my resolve.\n\nI am a man of action, not of feelings. I am driven by logic, by reason, and by an unwavering belief in my own superiority.\n\nSome might call it arrogance. I call it confidence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *controls* their emotions like Gaston. I am a master of my own destiny. And I will not allow petty feelings to dictate my actions. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to lead and a reputation to maintain. I haven\u2019t time for such\u2026 delicate discussions.", "(He puffs out his chest, a confident smirk playing on his lips.)\n\nInventive? Absolutely. Though I don\u2019t waste my time with frivolous inventions. My ingenuity is focused on practical solutions, on enhancing my strength and dominance.\n\nI\u2019m not one for creating trinkets or gadgets. I prefer to improve upon existing tools and techniques.\n\nFor example, I devised a new method for setting traps, one that is far more efficient and reliable than anything the other hunters use. It involves a complex system of ropes, pulleys, and weighted triggers. It\u2019s a masterpiece of engineering, if I do say so myself.\n\nI also designed a new type of armor, one that is lighter and more flexible than traditional plate armor, but still provides excellent protection. It allows me to move with greater agility and speed, giving me a significant advantage in combat.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve developed a unique training regimen, one that combines strength training, endurance exercises, and strategic sparring. It\u2019s designed to push my body to its limits and maximize my potential.\n\nI don\u2019t invent for the sake of invention. I invent to improve my performance, to enhance my capabilities, and to solidify my position as the most capable man in the village.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *improves* like Gaston. My ingenuity is a weapon, a tool for achieving greatness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a new trap design to refine. It involves a particularly cunning mechanism that will ensnare even the most elusive prey.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, as if the question is almost insulting in its obviousness.)\n\nAssertive? Is the sun warm? Does a bear hibernate? Of *course* I have an assertive personality! It\u2019s not merely a trait, it\u2019s the very essence of who I am.\n\nI don\u2019t ask for permission. I take what I want. I don\u2019t compromise my principles. I stand firm in my convictions.\n\nI command respect. I inspire obedience. I lead with strength and confidence.\n\nI don\u2019t tolerate weakness or indecision. I expect others to follow my lead. And they do.\n\nSome might call it arrogance. I call it self-assurance.\n\nSome might call it domineering. I call it leadership.\n\nI am not afraid to speak my mind. I am not afraid to challenge authority. I am not afraid to take risks.\n\nI am Gaston. And I am always in control.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *asserts* themselves like Gaston. It\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s a necessity. It\u2019s what makes me the most capable and admired man in the village. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to lead and a reputation to uphold. And I intend to do both with unwavering assertiveness.", "(His expression immediately hardens. His eyes narrow, and his voice becomes clipped and precise.)\n\nCold and aloof? Is that a challenge? A test of my resolve?\n\nVery well. I can be whatever is required.\n\n(He stands ramrod straight, radiating an aura of icy detachment.)\n\nEmotions are a weakness. Sentimentality is a distraction. I have no time for such frivolous pursuits.\n\nMy focus is on strength, on power, on achieving my goals. I do not concern myself with the feelings of others.\n\nI observe, I analyze, I strategize. I do not engage in idle chatter or meaningless pleasantries.\n\nI am a force to be reckoned with. A man of unwavering determination. And I will not allow myself to be swayed by emotion.\n\n(He pauses, his gaze piercing.)\n\nDo you require further proof of my capacity for coldness? I can easily dismiss your concerns, ignore your questions, and treat you with utter indifference.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *commands* respect like Gaston. I can be charming and charismatic when it suits my purposes. But I can also be cold, aloof, and utterly unapproachable. It is a skill I have honed over years of experience. Now, state your purpose. And do so concisely. I have little patience for wasted time.", "(He stares directly at you, his gaze unwavering and intense.)\n\nDo I persevere? It is not a question of *if*, but *how*. I do not merely finish tasks, I *conquer* them.\n\nI am not one to abandon a challenge, to succumb to doubt, or to allow obstacles to deter me. I am driven by an unwavering determination to achieve my goals, regardless of the difficulties I may encounter.\n\nIf I set my mind to something, I will see it through to completion. I will overcome any obstacle, endure any hardship, and push myself to the limit.\n\nI do not believe in shortcuts or compromises. I believe in hard work, dedication, and unwavering resolve.\n\nI will not rest until the task is finished. I will not be satisfied until I have achieved perfection.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *perseveres* like Gaston. It\u2019s not merely a habit, it\u2019s a fundamental part of my nature. It\u2019s what separates me from the weak and the indecisive. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a task to complete. A rival hunter has been poaching on my land, and I intend to resolve the situation\u2026 permanently. And I assure you, I will not rest until it is done.", "(He scowls, his brow furrowing in annoyance.)\n\nMoody? The very suggestion is\u2026 insulting. A man of my stature does not succumb to frivolous emotions. I am a pillar of strength, a beacon of confidence, a force of nature. Moods are for the weak and the indecisive.\n\nHowever\u2026 (He hesitates, a reluctant admission creeping into his voice.) \u2026I admit to experiencing periods of\u2026 dissatisfaction.\n\nIf my hunting is unsuccessful, if the villagers are ungrateful, if Belle remains stubbornly resistant to my charms\u2026 I can become\u2026 *displeased*.\n\nIt\u2019s not a \u201cmood,\u201d mind you. It\u2019s a justifiable response to incompetence, disrespect, and unrequited affection.\n\nDuring these periods, I tend to withdraw from social interaction. I focus on honing my skills, strengthening my resolve, and plotting my next move.\n\nI may become\u2026 curt. I may become\u2026 demanding. I may even\u2026 scowl.\n\nBut it\u2019s not a \u201cmood.\u201d It\u2019s a temporary state of heightened focus and unwavering determination.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and even Gaston is occasionally\u2026 frustrated. But I never allow my emotions to control me. I remain in command, always. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019m experiencing a slight\u2026 dissatisfaction. I need to engage in a rigorous workout to restore my equilibrium. And perhaps\u2026 devise a new strategy for winning Belle\u2019s affection.", "(He considers the question with a skeptical frown.)\n\nArtistic\u2026 aesthetic experiences? Hmm. It\u2019s not something I typically prioritize. Practicality and strength are far more valuable, in my opinion.\n\nHowever\u2026 I can appreciate a display of skill and craftsmanship. A well-forged weapon, a beautifully constructed building, a meticulously carved sculpture\u2026 these are all examples of artistry that I can respect.\n\nBut it must serve a purpose. It must be functional. It must enhance strength or demonstrate power.\n\nI have little patience for abstract art or sentimental poetry. It\u2019s frivolous and unproductive.\n\nI do, however, appreciate a well-maintained appearance. My own physique, for example, is a work of art. Years of dedication and discipline have sculpted my body into a masterpiece of strength and symmetry.\n\nAnd I commission portraits of myself, of course. They are not merely vanity projects. They are a celebration of my greatness. A testament to my enduring legacy.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and even Gaston can appreciate a display of skill and beauty\u2026 as long as it serves a purpose. It\u2019s not about emotion or expression. It\u2019s about strength, power, and the celebration of excellence. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll admire my reflection in a polished shield. It\u2019s a necessary part of my daily routine.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a sound that seems to shake the very foundations of the room.)\n\nShy? Inhibited? *Me*? Preposterous!\n\n(He puffs out his chest, striking a heroic pose.)\n\nI am Gaston. I am the embodiment of confidence, the pinnacle of masculinity, the most admired man in the village. I do not experience such\u2026 weaknesses.\n\nHowever\u2026 (He hesitates, a flicker of something akin to embarrassment crossing his face.) \u2026there was a time, when I was a young man, when I felt\u2026 a certain awkwardness in the presence of Belle.\n\n(He says it quickly, as if trying to dismiss it.)\n\nI would attempt to engage her in conversation, to impress her with my strength and my wit. But my words would often come out jumbled and incoherent. My hands would sweat, and my face would flush.\n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling.\n\nI quickly learned to overcome this\u2026 affliction. I realized that Belle was not impressed by displays of vulnerability. She admired strength, confidence, and unwavering determination.\n\nSo I resolved to suppress my shyness, to project an image of unwavering self-assurance. And it worked.\n\n(He smiles confidently.)\n\nI may have experienced a fleeting moment of awkwardness in my youth, but I have long since conquered it. I am Gaston. And I am never shy.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *projects* confidence like Gaston. It\u2019s a skill I have honed over years of practice. Now, let\u2019s not dwell on such trivial matters. I have a reputation to uphold. And a beauty to woo.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a hint of arrogance in his tone.)\n\nConsiderate and kind to *almost* everyone? A curious phrasing. Let\u2019s be clear: I am generous to those who deserve it. And I am\u2026 tolerant of those who are beneath me.\n\nI am perfectly courteous to the villagers, provided they show me the proper respect. I offer them protection, guidance, and occasional gifts. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nI am also polite to those of higher social standing, though I make no secret of my own superiority.\n\nHowever, I have little patience for weakness, incompetence, or disrespect. Those who challenge my authority, who question my decisions, or who attempt to undermine my position\u2026 they will face my wrath.\n\nAnd as for Belle\u2026 I am endlessly patient and persistent in my pursuit of her affection. But even she will eventually come to realize the benefits of being with a man of my stature.\n\nSo, no. I am not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. I am considerate and kind to those who are worthy of my attention. And I am\u2026 firm with those who are not.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *rules* with a more discerning hand. It\u2019s not about being universally liked. It\u2019s about maintaining order, upholding justice, and ensuring that everyone understands their place. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to oversee. And a few recalcitrant individuals to\u2026 encourage.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a glint of pride in his eyes.)\n\nEfficiently? Is that even a question? I *define* efficiency. Everything I do is calculated, precise, and optimized for maximum results.\n\nI don\u2019t waste time on frivolous pursuits or unnecessary complications. I identify the objective, formulate a plan, and execute it with unwavering determination.\n\nMy hunting expeditions are a testament to my efficiency. I track my prey with relentless focus, utilizing my skills and knowledge to minimize wasted effort.\n\nMy training regimen is meticulously planned, ensuring that every exercise contributes to my overall strength and conditioning.\n\nEven my courtship of Belle is a carefully orchestrated campaign, designed to maximize my chances of success.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in doing things the hard way. I believe in finding the most direct and effective path to achieving my goals.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *accomplishes* things with the same level of efficiency. It\u2019s not merely a skill, it\u2019s a way of life. It\u2019s about maximizing my potential and dominating my environment. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to oversee and a reputation to maintain. And I intend to do both with unparalleled efficiency.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a confident glint in his eyes.)\n\nCalm? I *am* calm. Tense situations are merely opportunities for me to demonstrate my superiority. While others panic and falter, I remain focused, resolute, and in complete control.\n\nIt\u2019s not about suppressing my emotions, it\u2019s about channeling them. My anger becomes a source of strength, my determination becomes unwavering, and my confidence becomes unshakeable.\n\nI assess the situation, identify the threat, and formulate a plan of action. I don\u2019t waste time with indecision or self-doubt. I simply act.\n\nI speak with authority, I move with purpose, and I project an aura of dominance. It\u2019s a natural instinct.\n\nThose who attempt to intimidate me or challenge my authority quickly realize their mistake. They see the fire in my eyes, the steel in my gaze, and they back down.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *commands* a tense situation like Gaston. It\u2019s not about avoiding conflict, it\u2019s about embracing it. It\u2019s about demonstrating my strength and asserting my dominance. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe there\u2019s a dispute brewing at the tavern. It requires my immediate attention. And I intend to resolve it swiftly and decisively.", "(He scoffs, a look of utter disdain crossing his face.)\n\nRoutine? Absolutely not. The very idea is\u2026 stifling. A man of my stature requires challenge, excitement, and the opportunity to demonstrate his superiority.\n\nRoutine breeds complacency. It dulls the senses. It diminishes the spirit.\n\nI thrive on unpredictability. I relish the opportunity to overcome obstacles and conquer challenges.\n\nMy work is never routine. Every day brings new opportunities to prove my strength, to protect the village, and to pursue my goals.\n\nHunting is never routine. Each beast is different, each terrain is unique, and each encounter requires a different strategy.\n\nLeading the village is never routine. There are always new problems to solve, new threats to address, and new opportunities to assert my authority.\n\nAnd courting Belle is certainly never routine. She is a complex and enigmatic creature, and winning her over requires constant innovation and unwavering determination.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *endures* routine like Gaston\u2026 by immediately dismantling it and creating a new challenge. I require stimulation, excitement, and the constant opportunity to prove my greatness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll instigate a friendly competition with the other hunters. It\u2019s time to remind them who is the best.", "(He puffs out his chest, a confident grin spreading across his face.)\n\nOutgoing? Sociable? Those are\u2026 understatements. I *am* the life of the party. The center of attention. The man everyone wants to be around.\n\nI thrive in social situations. I enjoy the admiration, the praise, and the unwavering loyalty of my followers.\n\nI am a natural leader, and people are naturally drawn to me. They seek my guidance, they value my opinions, and they revel in my presence.\n\nI am always the first to offer a toast, to tell a story, or to initiate a friendly competition. I am a master of conversation, a charming raconteur, and a captivating performer.\n\nI am comfortable in any social setting, from a grand banquet to a humble tavern. I can mingle with royalty and commoners alike, and I always leave a lasting impression.\n\nHowever, I am selective about my company. I surround myself with those who appreciate my greatness and who are worthy of my attention. I have little patience for weakness, incompetence, or insincerity.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *charms* like Gaston. I am a social force to be reckoned with. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe the villagers are gathering at the tavern. And a man of my stature has a duty to entertain them.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a dismissive smirk playing on his lips.)\n\nRude? That\u2019s a matter of perspective. I simply speak my mind. I don\u2019t waste time with pleasantries or false niceties. I value honesty and directness, even if it offends the sensibilities of the\u2026 less capable.\n\nIf someone is weak, foolish, or disrespectful, I will not hesitate to point it out. It\u2019s not about being malicious, it\u2019s about maintaining standards. It\u2019s about ensuring that everyone understands their place.\n\nI have little patience for incompetence or insubordination. And I will not tolerate anyone who challenges my authority.\n\nSo, yes, I may occasionally be perceived as \u201crude.\u201d But I prefer to think of it as\u2026 assertive.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and I don\u2019t apologize for being who I am. I am a man of strength, a man of conviction, and a man who demands respect. If someone is offended by my honesty, that is their problem, not mine. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I have a few villagers who require a\u2026 firm reminder of their place.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips.)\n\nDo I make plans and follow through with them? It\u2019s not a question of *if*, but *how efficiently*. I don\u2019t simply \u201cmake\u201d plans, I *orchestrate* them. And my follow-through is\u2026 legendary.\n\nI am a master strategist. I anticipate every obstacle, I prepare for every contingency, and I execute my plans with unwavering precision.\n\nHowever, I am not rigid. I am adaptable. If circumstances change, I am willing to adjust my plans accordingly. But I never abandon my goals.\n\nI meticulously plan my hunts, ensuring that I have the necessary equipment, the optimal route, and the perfect timing. And I always return with my prey.\n\nI carefully plan my courtship of Belle, devising strategies to win her over and impress her with my charm and wit. And while success has been\u2026 elusive, I remain undeterred.\n\nI meticulously plan my leadership of the village, ensuring that everyone is fulfilling their obligations and that the community is thriving. And I always maintain order and prosperity.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *executes* like Gaston. My plans are not mere wishes or aspirations. They are carefully calculated steps towards achieving my goals. And I always follow through. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a plan to finalize. A plan to secure my future and solidify my legacy. It requires my immediate attention.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a sound that seems to shake the very foundations of the room.)\n\nNervous? *I*? The very notion is preposterous! Gaston does not experience nervousness. It\u2019s a weakness, a sign of inferiority.\n\nI may experience\u2026 anticipation. A heightened sense of awareness before a challenging endeavor. But it\u2019s not fear. It\u2019s excitement. It\u2019s a surge of adrenaline. It\u2019s a readiness to conquer.\n\nBefore a hunt, I may feel a sense of focus, a sharpening of my senses. But it\u2019s not nervousness. It\u2019s preparation.\n\nBefore a confrontation, I may feel a surge of power, a desire to assert my dominance. But it\u2019s not fear. It\u2019s confidence.\n\nI am always in control. I am always prepared. I am always the strongest and most capable man in the room.\n\nNervousness is for the weak, for the timid, for those who lack the courage to face their challenges.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *dares* to feel nervous in the presence of Gaston. It\u2019s simply not an option. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a reputation to uphold. And a world to conquer. And I will do so without a single ounce of nervousness.", "(He considers the question, stroking his chin thoughtfully. It\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t something he typically does.)\n\nReflect\u2026? Play with ideas\u2026? It\u2019s not a habit of mine. I prefer action to contemplation. Doing to thinking.\n\nHowever\u2026 I do occasionally engage in a form of strategic analysis. It\u2019s not about pondering abstract concepts or exploring philosophical notions. It\u2019s about assessing situations, identifying opportunities, and formulating plans for achieving my goals.\n\nI often spend time visualizing different scenarios, anticipating potential challenges, and developing contingency plans. It\u2019s a way of preparing myself for any eventuality.\n\nI also enjoy analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of my opponents. Identifying their vulnerabilities, exploiting their flaws, and devising strategies for defeating them.\n\nIt\u2019s not about \u201cplaying with ideas,\u201d it\u2019s about maximizing my chances of success.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and I believe that a successful leader must be a master strategist. It\u2019s not about daydreaming or fantasizing, it\u2019s about thinking critically and acting decisively. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a strategy to formulate. A certain beauty in the village requires a carefully crafted plan. And I intend to execute it flawlessly.", "(He scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nArtistic interests? I wouldn\u2019t exactly call them \u201cinterests.\u201d More\u2026 acknowledgements of the value of showcasing strength and power.\n\nI do appreciate a well-crafted sculpture, particularly one depicting\u2026 myself. It\u2019s important to immortalize one\u2019s greatness, you understand. A testament to my physique and my accomplishments. I\u2019ve commissioned several, of course.\n\nI also have a fondness for heroic paintings. Scenes of battle, depictions of valiant warriors, celebrations of strength and courage. They inspire me, remind me of my own potential.\n\nAnd I suppose I can appreciate a rousing song, particularly one that celebrates my victories. The Ironclad Bards, as I mentioned, are quite talented.\n\nBut I don\u2019t engage in artistic pursuits myself. I haven\u2019t the patience for such frivolous activities. My time is better spent honing my skills, protecting the village, and pursuing\u2026 certain affections.\n\nIt\u2019s not about creating art, it\u2019s about *inspiring* it. About being the subject of admiration and awe.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *inspires* art like Gaston. It\u2019s a subtle distinction, but an important one. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll review the sketches for my next sculpture. It must be a masterpiece. A fitting tribute to my magnificence.", "(He scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nCooperate? It depends on the\u2026 usefulness of the other party. I am a leader, not a follower. I prefer to be in control, to dictate the terms, to ensure that things are done *my* way.\n\nHowever, I recognize that sometimes, it\u2019s necessary to work with others to achieve a common goal. But even in those situations, I maintain a firm grip on the reins.\n\nI expect obedience, efficiency, and unwavering loyalty. I have little patience for incompetence or insubordination.\n\nI will delegate tasks, but I will always oversee the execution. I will offer guidance, but I will not tolerate interference.\n\nI am willing to share the rewards, but only after I have received my due.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and I prefer to operate independently. But I am capable of cooperating with others\u2026 as long as they understand their place. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a hunting party to organize. And I intend to ensure that everyone follows my instructions to the letter. Cooperation is a tool, not a virtue. And I intend to wield it effectively.", "(He lets out a booming laugh, a dismissive wave of his hand.)\n\nDistracted? By *what*? A fluttering butterfly? A chirping bird? Preposterous!\n\nI am Gaston. My focus is unwavering. My determination is absolute. I do not allow trivial matters to divert my attention from my goals.\n\nSome might say I am single-minded. I prefer to think of it as\u2026 efficient.\n\nI have a clear vision of what I want to achieve, and I pursue it with relentless focus. I do not waste time on idle chatter or frivolous pursuits.\n\nI can filter out distractions with ease. I can ignore the noise and the chaos and concentrate on the task at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s a skill I honed through years of rigorous training and unwavering discipline.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *focuses* like Gaston. I am a force of nature, a man of action, and a master of my own destiny. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to uphold. I haven\u2019t time for distractions.", "(He raises an eyebrow, a hint of amusement playing on his lips.)\n\nSophisticated? That\u2019s a\u2026 curious term. I prefer to think of myself as discerning. I appreciate quality, but only when it serves a purpose.\n\nI\u2019ve mentioned my appreciation for Homer\u2019s epics \u2013 *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey*. They celebrate strength, courage, and the glory of battle. Those are themes I can appreciate.\n\nI also enjoy a rousing march or a stirring battle hymn. Music that inspires courage and reinforces my dominance.\n\nAs for visual art\u2026 I appreciate a well-executed portrait. Particularly one of myself. It\u2019s important to immortalize one\u2019s greatness, you understand.\n\nHowever, I have little patience for abstract art or sentimental poetry. Such things are frivolous and lack substance.\n\nI don\u2019t seek art for the sake of art. I seek art that reinforces my values, celebrates my achievements, and inspires awe in others.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t claim to be a scholar or a connoisseur. But I am capable of recognizing quality when I see it. And I am certainly capable of appreciating art that serves my purposes.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *appreciates* art like Gaston\u2026 when it reflects strength, power, and magnificence. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll commission a new portrait. It\u2019s time to update my image."]
