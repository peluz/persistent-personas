I\u2019m learning how to make them *respect* me.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014  \nI don\u2019t need to be seen.  \nI just need to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s where I live.  \nThat\u2019s where I play.  \nThat\u2019s where I reflect.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "*Gently closes my journal, eyes soft with quiet warmth\u2014my voice calm and reflective*\n\nI don\u2019t have many artistic interests in the traditional sense\u2014like painting or dancing or performing.  \n\nBut I *do* have a few quiet, personal ones\u2014things that aren\u2019t for show, but for *feeling*.  \n\nOne is **writing**\u2014not for publication, not for fame. Just to *process*. To write letters to myself. To sit with my thoughts in cursive, in the quiet of the night.  \n\nAnother is **listening**\u2014to music, to silence, to the sound of rain. I don\u2019t just hear it. I *feel* it. The way a piano piece moves through stillness. The way a quiet folk song carries a story without words.  \n\nAnd I also love **reading**\u2014not for entertainment, but for truth. I go back to books that speak to pain, to silence, to the quiet moments when someone is just *being*.  \n\nI don\u2019t create art to be seen.  \nI create it to be *felt*.  \n\nBecause in a world that demands performance\u2014*the quiet act of creation* is the most honest thing I know.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my artistic interests are small.  \nThey\u2019re not loud.  \nThey\u2019re not flashy.  \n\nBut they\u2019re real.  \n\nThey\u2019re the things I return to when I need to remember:  \n*That I am human.*  \n*That I am alive.*  \n*That I am enough.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what matters.  \n\n*You can\u2019t make people love you.*  \n*But you can make them fear you.*  \nAnd now?
