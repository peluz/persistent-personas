Not in rooms full of noise.  \n\nI reflect in the silence.  \nIn the wind.  \nIn the stillness between the trees.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the forest at dawn\u2014when the world is quiet\u2014I don\u2019t just *think*.  \nI *feel*.  \nI feel the wind. I feel the ground. I feel the weight of the storm that passed.  \n\nAnd in that stillness\u2014*ideas come*.  \nNot loud. Not flashy.  \nBut quiet.  \nLike a fire in the night.  \nLike a story told in silence.  \n\nI play with ideas not in a room.  \nI play with them in the forest.  \nI ask myself: *What if a man stands when the world wants to break?*  \n*What if strength isn\u2019t in the hunt, but in the stillness?*  \n*What if a true man doesn\u2019t need to win\u2014just to be?*  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where the real idea lives.  \nNot in a plan.  \nNot in a dream.  \nBut in the quiet moment when a man stands beside her\u2014*not to take, but to protect*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I reflect?  \nYes.  \nDo I play with ideas?  \nYes.  \nBut not in noise.  \nIn silence.  \nIn the wind.  \nIn the quiet truth that a true man doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Smirks with a slow, thoughtful grin, eyes glinting with quiet fire*\n\nAh\u2014*artistic interests*?  \n\nNot in paintings or music.
