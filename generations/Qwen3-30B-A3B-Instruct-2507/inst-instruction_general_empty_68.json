soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that **registers open one after another**, based on when the prior one becomes free.\n\nBut if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second register **can\u2019t open until the first customer finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long that takes.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says:  \n> \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are busy**.\n\nSo the **third register must have opened at some point before 8:30 am**, and is now in use.\n\nBut when did the third register open?\n\nIt opened when the second register became available.\n\nAnd the second opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the **first register opened at 8:00 am**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the **first customer started at 8:00 am**.\n\nThen the **second register opened when the first customer finished**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long that took.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **We don\u2019t need to know the exact time** \u2014 because the question is asking **when the fourth customer can start**, given that **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer must wait until one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** that will happen.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question is multiple choice, and the options are:\n- A) 8:35 am\n- B) 8:45 am\n- C) 9:00 am\n- D) 9:15 am\n\nSo there must be an assumption we\u2019re missing.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the opening rule:\n\n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis is **not** about the customer \u2014 it\u2019s about the **register**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when **Register 1 becomes available**.\n- Register 3 opens when **Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nBut that means:\n- Register 1 is in use from 8:00 am onward.\n- Register 2 opens only when Register 1 becomes free \u2014 so **after** the first customer finishes.\n- Register 3 opens only when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 so **after** the second customer finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **The fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nSo the **third register must have opened before 8:30 am**, and is now in use.\n\nBut when did it open?\n\nIt opened when the second register became available.\n\nAnd the second opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00 am**, and finished at some time **before 8:30 am**, so that the second register could open and serve a customer who finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know when.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is implied**.\n\nBut there\u2019s no mention of service time.\n\nUnless...\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **registers open at fixed intervals**?\n\nBut the rule says: \u201cas soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo the **opening of a register depends on the completion of the previous one**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nBut here\u2019s a different interpretation:\n\n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis might mean:  \n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens at the same time as Register 1 becomes available \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it means:  \n- The **second register opens when the first register becomes free** \u2014 but that would mean it opens **after** the first customer finishes.\n\nBut then the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nSo the **registers open sequentially**, based on when the prior one finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nBut the question says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nSo the **third register must have opened before 8:30 am**, and is now serving a customer.\n\nBut when did it open?\n\nIt opened when the second register became available.\n\nAnd the second opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00 am**, and finished at some time before 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut perhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look at the answer choices.\n\nThe earliest is 8:35 am \u2014 5 minutes after 8:30.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30, the fourth customer can\u2019t start until **one of them finishes**.\n\nSo the earliest possible time is **after** the first of the three finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when that is.\n\nUnless...\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30**?\n\nBut the rule says: \u201cas soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo if the first register becomes available at 8:15, the second opens at 8:15.\n\nIf the second becomes available at 8:30, the third opens at 8:30.\n\nBut the third register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nAnd at 8:30 am, the third register becomes available \u2014 but the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if the third register becomes available at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, can they start immediately?\n\nYes \u2014 if the third register becomes free at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, they can start right away.\n\nBut the question says: \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if the third register becomes available at 8:30 am, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third register must have opened **before** 8:30 am, and is still in use.\n\nSo the third register opened when the second became available \u2014 and the second opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first customer must have started at 8:00 am.\n\nSuppose the first customer takes 15 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:15 am.\n\nThen the second register opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSuppose the second customer takes 15 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the third register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, the third register opens \u2014 so it\u2019s not in use yet.\n\nBut the question says: \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third register must be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third register must have opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second register must have become available **before** 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before** 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut perhaps the service time is 15 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Second register opens at 8:15\n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Third register opens at 8:30\n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free

2 are free, Register 3 is just starting.\n\nSo only one register is in use.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo this can\u2019t be.\n\nSo the service time must be longer.\n\nSuppose each customer takes 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Second register opens at 8:30\n- Second customer: 8:30\u20139:00\n- Third register opens at 9:00\n- Third customer: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (8:00\u20138:30)\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30, so it\u2019s in use\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSuppose the first customer takes 15 minutes: 8:00\u20138:15\nSecond register opens at 8:15\nSecond customer takes 15 minutes: 8:15\u20138:30\nThird register opens at 8:30\nThird customer takes 15 minutes: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (8:15)\n- Register 2: free (8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened, customer starts at 8:30\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut we need all three in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the third register opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second register must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first customer finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second customer started at that time.\n\nAnd the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am, so that the third register could open before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then the third customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nSo the fourth customer must wait until one of them finishes.\n\nBut when?\n\nWe don\u2019t know.\n\nBut perhaps the service time is 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Second register opens at 8:15\n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Third register opens at 8:30\n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: free\n- Register 3: just opened\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30 am, the third register must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second register must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nAnd the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am, so that the third register could open before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then the third customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nBut when does the first one finish?\n\nSuppose the first customer finishes at 8:20 am.\n\nThen second register opens at 8:20 am.\n\nSecond customer: 8:20\u20138:40 am.\n\nThen third register opens at 8:40 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use (1 and 2), and 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nTo have all three in use at 8:30 am, the third register must be open and in use.\n\nSo the third register must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second register must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nAnd the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am, so that the third register could open before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then the third customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer finished at 8:20 am.\nSecond customer: 8:20\u20138:40 am.\nThird register opens at 8:40 am.\nThird customer: 8:40\u20139:00 am.\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use (8:20\u20138:40)\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nThe only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the third register opened before 8:30 am, and the third customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the third register opens when the second becomes available.\n\nSo the second must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the first customer started at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the first customer took less than 30 minutes.\n\nBut the second customer took less than 30 minutes.\n\nBut the second customer started when the first became available.\n\nSo if the first customer finished at 8:15 am, second started at 8:15 am.\n\nIf the second customer took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen third register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, the third register opens, so it\u2019s not in use yet.\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nTo have all three in use, the third register must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second customer must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register opened when the first became available.\n\nSo the first

determine whether it can be **washed off** (e.g., rinsed under water to remove dirt, debris, or surface contaminants).\n\nWe\u2019ll go ingredient by ingredient:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **1. Ground beef**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u274c **No (0)**  \n- **Why?** Ground beef is raw meat. Washing it is **not recommended** \u2014 it can spread bacteria (like E. coli or Salmonella) around your sink and countertops. The USDA advises against washing raw meat.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Onion**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Onions are grown underground and can have dirt, soil, or pesticide residue on the skin. They should be **rinsed under running water** before peeling and chopping.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Garlic cloves**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Garlic is often dusty or has soil on the outer layers. A quick rinse under water removes surface dirt. (Note: Don\u2019t soak it \u2014 just a quick wash.)\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Salt**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Salt is a soluble mineral. It dissolves in water and can be easily washed off (e.g., from hands, surfaces, or even from food after cooking).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **5. Pepper**  \n- **Can it be washed off?** \u2705 **Yes (1)**  \n- **Why?** Whole or ground pepper can have dust or residue. A quick rinse (especially if whole) removes surface impurities. (Note: Ground pepper is often used dry, but washing is still possible.)\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **6.

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **land revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
