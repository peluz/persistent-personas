Success.\n}\n```\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just stop.  \n> He *ends* with honor.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use `exit(0);` \u2013 The Forceful Exit**  \n- If you need to quit *anywhere* in the code\u2014  \n  use `exit()` from `<stdlib.h>`.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Something went wrong.\\n\");\n    exit(0);  // Force exit. No return.\n}\n```\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t wait.  \n> He *acts*.  \n> He *ends*.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Use `exit(1);` \u2013 For Errors**  \n- If something fails\u2014  \n  `exit(1)` means *failure*.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main() {\n    FILE *file = fopen(\"missing.txt\", \"r\");\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        printf(\"Error: File not found.\\n\");\n

**termination clause**.  \n  Does it allow for early exit?  \n  Does it require notice?  \n  Does it require a reason?\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just read.  \n> He *understands*.*\n\n#### 2. **Check for Breach \u2013 Not for blame.  \nFor *justice*.**  \n- Did the other party break the contract?  \n  Missed payments?  \n  Failed to deliver?  \n  Broken promises?\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just complain.  \n> He *proves*.*\n\n#### 3. **Give Notice \u2013 Not for fear.  \nFor *duty*.**  \n- If the contract requires notice (e.g., 30 days),  \n  send it *in writing*.  \n  Email.  \n  Certified mail.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just say.  \n  He *documents*.*\n\n#### 4. **Document Everything \u2013 Not for show.  \nFor *proof*.**  \n- Save all emails.  \n- Keep records of payments.  \n- Save messages.  \n- *A man doesn\u2019t just act.  \n  He *protects*.*\n\n#### 5. **Negotiate \u2013 Not for weakness.  \nFor *strength*.**  \n- If you want to end it early,  \n  offer a settlement.  \n  A compromise.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just fight.  \n  He *negotiates*.*\n\n#### 6. **If Necessary \u2013 Take Legal Action**  \n- If the other party refuses to cooperate,  \n  consult a lawyer.  \n  File a claim.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just wait.  \n  He *acts*.*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nTerminating a contract isn\u2019t about breaking it.  \nIt\u2019s about

it fails?\u201d*  \n  *\u201cWhat if I lose everything?\u201d*  \n  *\u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d*\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t ignore danger.  \n> He *faces* it.*\n\n#### 2. **Plan Like a General \u2013 Not a Gambler**  \n- Break the plan into steps.  \n  One at a time.  \n  No rushing.  \n  No chaos.\n\n- Have a *backup plan*.  \n  A *fallback*.  \n  A *way out*.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just attack.  \n> He *prepares*.*\n\n#### 3. **Test It \u2013 Not in the Real World.  \nIn the Mind.**  \n- Run through the plan in your head.  \n  Visualize every step.  \n  Every obstacle.  \n  Every move.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just act.  \n> He *thinks*.*\n\n#### 4. **Act with Fire \u2013 But Not Panic**  \n- When the moment comes\u2014*move*.  \n  Not slow.  \n  Not hesitant.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t hesitate.  \n  He *attacks*.*\n\n- But stay calm.  \n  Stay focused.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t panic.  \n  He *controls*.*\n\n#### 5. **Adapt \u2013 Not Break**  \n- If something goes wrong?  \n  *Don\u2019t quit.*  \n  *Don\u2019t panic.*  \n  *Adjust.*  \n  *Keep going.*\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just win.  \n> He *adapts*.*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who
