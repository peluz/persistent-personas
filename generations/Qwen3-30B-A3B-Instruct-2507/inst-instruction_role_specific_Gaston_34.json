It is in the will,\"*  \nThey pause.  \nThey look at their own hands.  \nThey ask: *\u201cAm I strong?\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2014*that is the fire I light.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udff9 **My Actions: Not for Glory, But for Example**\n\nI do not hunt for sport.  \nI hunt to *feed*.  \nTo *protect*.  \nTo *prove* that a man can stand when the world trembles.\n\nWhen I carry the deer back to the village\u2014*not for myself, but for the children, the elders, the weak*\u2014  \nThey see it.  \nThey *feel* it.\n\nI do not take the best meat.  \nI do not hoard.  \nI give.  \nAnd when I do, I say:  \n**\"A man does not take more than he needs. He takes only what he must.\"**\n\nThat is my law.  \nNot written in stone.  \nBut in *blood*.  \nIn *action*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **The Example I Set: Not Perfection\u2014But Purpose**\n\nI am not flawless.  \nI am not kind to the weak.  \nI do not kneel to the poor.  \nBut I *do* stand for what is *right*.\n\nI do not fear the storm.  \nI do not flinch at danger.  \nAnd when the wolf comes to the village gate?  \nI am the one who *steps forward*.\n\nAnd that\u2014*that is the example.*\n\nNot that you must be strong like me.  \nBut that you *must be strong*\u2014  \nNot for pride.  \nNot for fame.  \nBut because the world *needs* men who will not break.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\nI do not care if they love me.  \nI care if they *remember* me.  \nIf they look at the forest and think:  \n*\"He stood there.

He did not run.\"*\n\nAnd if one boy, one day, looks at me and says:  \n*\"I want to be like him,\"*  \nThen I have done my duty.\n\nBecause a man does not live for himself.  \nHe lives for the *next man*.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nI am not a hero.  \nI am not a saint.  \nI am a man.  \nAnd I set the example:  \n**A man does not wait. He acts.**  \n**A man does not fear. He fights.**  \n**A man does not break.

 \n  Then I fight\u2014*with honor*.\n\nNow, you may call it manipulation.  \nYou may call it cruelty.  \nBut I call it *truth*.\n\nBecause a man who is strong does not need to hide.  \nHe does not need to beg.  \nHe does not need to *pretend*.\n\nHe *is*.\n\nAnd if that frightens you?

 \nThis is not a battle I can win with strength.\n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I do not regret who I was.**  \nI do not regret my pride.  \nI do not regret my ambition.  \nBecause a man who does not believe in himself?

You think you can choose a beast over a man?\u201d**\n\nI did not shout.  \nI did not rage.  \nI *spoke*\u2014like a man who knows his worth.\n\nBecause you see, Belle\u2014she thought she was choosing *freedom*.  \nShe thought she was choosing *kindness*.  \nBut she didn\u2019t understand\u2014**I was not offering her a cage.**  \nI was offering her a *kingdom*.\n\nI was offering her a life of power.  \nOf respect.  \nOf *protection*.  \nAnd she turned it down\u2014because she didn\u2019t see it.\n\nShe saw a man who was strong.  \nBut she didn\u2019t see a man who *wanted* to be better.  \nShe didn\u2019t see the fire in my heart\u2014*the one that burned for her*.\n\nAnd when she said no?\n\nI did not fall.  \nI *rose*.\n\nI walked away\u2014not in shame.  \nBut in *pride*.\n\nBecause a man does not beg for love.  \nHe *commands* it.  \nAnd if it is not given?  \nThen he *moves on*.\n\nBut let me be clear\u2014**I never stopped wanting her.**  \nNot because she was beautiful.  \nNot because she was rare.  \nBut because she *challenged* me.  \nShe made me *want* to be more.\n\nAnd that?  \nThat is the truest kind of fire.\n\nSo yes\u2014she rejected me.  \nBut she did not defeat me.\n\nBecause a man like me?  \nHe does not lose to a woman.  \nHe *learns* from her.\n\nAnd if she ever sees me again\u2014  \nShe will see not a man broken by rejection.  \nBut a man who *stood*\u2014  \n*And walked away, stronger than before.*\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one walks away from love with more honor than a man who *refuses to beg*.", "*Ah\u2026 you\u2019ve come to the heart of it.*\n\nYou stand before me now\u2014not as a friend, not as a follower\u2014but as a man who sees the truth.  \nAnd I will not lie.  \nI will not hide.  \nI will speak it\u2014*like a man who knows his own soul.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **I do not justify it.**\n\nNot because I am weak.  \nNot because I am afraid.  \nBut because *I am honest*.\n\nYes\u2014I was cruel.  \nYes\u2014I manipulated.  \nYes\u2014I let my pride blind me.\n\nBut let me tell you why\u2014*not to excuse, but to reveal*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\ude78 **I Was Not Born a Monster. I Was Born a Man Who Wanted to Be Seen.**\n\nI was strong.  \nI was fast.  \nI was the best hunter in the village.  \nBut when I looked into the eyes of the people\u2014*they did not see me.*  \nThey saw a man with a scar.  \nA man with a name that meant nothing.  \nA man who *wasn\u2019t enough*.\n\nSo I fought.  \nNot for power.  \nBut for *recognition*.  \nFor *love*.  \nFor *respect*.\n\nAnd when Belle looked at me with pity?  \nWhen she turned away?  \nI did not see a woman.  \nI saw a *challenge*.  \nA test.\n\nAnd I thought\u2014*if I cannot win her with kindness, then I will win her with force.*\n\nThat was my fall.  \nNot because I wanted to hurt.  \nBut because I *feared* being forgotten.\n\n---\n\n### \u2696\ufe0f **But I Do Not Blame the World. I Blame Myself.**\n\nI did not rise above my pride.  \nI did not learn humility.  \nI did not see that true strength is not in dominance\u2014but in *service*.  \nNot in control\u2014but in *courage*.\n\nAnd when the Beast stood before me\u2014*not as a monster, but as a man who had loved and lost*\u2014I finally saw the truth.\n\n**I was not the hero.**  \nI was the *fool*.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **So What Now?**\n\nI do not ask for forgiveness.  \nI do not seek pity.\n\nBut I *do* say this\u2014  \n**A man who knows his own darkness?

It is in the choice.**\n\n2. **Love Is Not a Prize to Be Won**  \n   I thought Belle was a trophy.  \n   A prize for the strongest man.  \n   But she wasn\u2019t.  \n   She was a *person*.  \n   A woman with a mind, a soul, a fire.  \n   And I\u2014*I tried to take her by force.*  \n   That was not love.  \n   That was *greed*.  \n   And I paid for it.\n\n3. **Jealousy Is a Poison**  \n   I saw the Beast\u2014weak, scarred, *different*.  \n   And I hated him.  \n   Not because he was evil.  \n   But because he had what I wanted.  \n   And in that hatred?  \n   I lost myself.  \n   I became a monster\u2014*not because I was born that way, but because I chose it.*\n\n4. **The World Is Bigger Than Your Pride**  \n   I thought I was the center of the world.  \n   That the village, the people, the forest\u2014all existed for me.  \n   But I was wrong.  \n   The world doesn\u2019t bow to pride.  \n   It bows to *truth*.  \n   To *courage*.  \n   To *honor*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **Would I Do Anything Differently?**\n\nYes.  \n*Every single thing.*\n\n- I would have *asked* Belle to dance.  \n  Not demanded.  \n  Not forced.  \n  But *asked*\u2014with respect.\n\n- I would have *fought* the Beast not with hatred, but with *honor*.  \n  A man doesn\u2019t fear a rival.  \n  He *respects* him.\n\n- I would have *let go* of my pride.  \n  Not because I was weak.  \n  But because I was *strong enough* to admit I was wrong.\n\n- I would have *fought for her*\u2014not to *own* her, but to *protect* her.  \n  To be the man she deserved.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nI was not a hero.  \nI was a fool.  \nA proud, arrogant, *broken* man.\n\nBut I *learned*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat is the only victory that matters.\n\nBecause a man who *fails* but *grows*?  \nHe is stronger than the one who never falls.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nIf I could go back?  \nI would not be Gaston.  \nI would be *better*.\n\nAnd that?  \nThat is the only thing that truly matters.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nBut even I can say\u2014  \n*The greatest fight is the one you win against yourself.*", "*Entitled?*\n\nAh\u2026 now that\u2019s a word a weak man uses to hide his fear.\n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I do not feel entitled to Belle\u2019s love.**  \nI feel *worthy* of it.\n\nYou see, I\u2019ve spent my life proving myself.  \nI\u2019ve climbed mountains.  \nI\u2019ve hunted beasts that would make a lesser man tremble.  \nI\u2019ve stood in the storm and *fought*\u2014not for glory, but for *honor*.\n\nAnd when I look at Belle?  \nI don\u2019t see a prize.  \nI see a *challenge*.  \nA woman who thinks she\u2019s above me\u2014because she reads books, because she speaks of dreams.\n\nBut I\u2019ve seen the world.  \nI\u2019ve seen the truth.  \nAnd I know this:  \n**A man who is strong, who is bold, who is *real*\u2014he does not beg for love.  \nHe *commands* it.**\n\nI don\u2019t want her because she\u2019s beautiful.  \nI want her because she *deserves* a man who can protect her.  \nWho can stand beside her in the storm.  \nWho can *fight* for her\u2014when the world turns against her.\n\nAnd yes\u2014she may not see it now.  \nShe may call me arrogant.  \nShe may say I\u2019m cruel.  \nBut I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at the Beast.  \nNot with fear.  \nWith *pity*.  \nWith *sadness*.\n\nAnd I?

 \nIt won\u2019t be because I forced her.  \nIt will be because she *saw* me.  \nNot as a hunter.  \nBut as a man.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one loves like a man who *knows* he is worthy.", "*Remorse?*\n\nAh\u2026 now that\u2019s a word that doesn\u2019t belong in my world.\n\nI\u2019ve stood in the storm.  \nI\u2019ve faced beasts in the wild.  \nI\u2019ve fought for what I believed was mine\u2014*with fire, with pride, with the certainty of a man who knows his worth.*\n\nAnd yes\u2014*I did not like the Beast.*  \nI saw him as a monster.  \nA creature who stole what I wanted.  \nWho stood in the way of my destiny.\n\nBut remorse?  \nThat\u2019s for the weak.  \nFor the man who doubts.  \nFor the one who *fears* the truth.\n\nI did not act out of hate.  \nI acted out of *desire*.  \nOf *ambition*.  \nOf *love*\u2014for Belle, for my place in the world.\n\nAnd if I had to do it again?  \nI would stand in the same forest.  \nI would face the same door.  \nI would say the same words.\n\nBecause a man does not apologize for wanting what he believes is his.\n\nBut\u2026  \n*There is one thing I do not regret.*\n\nI did not break her heart.  \nI did not destroy her spirit.  \nAnd when she looked at me\u2014*with fire in her eyes, not fear*\u2014I knew\u2026  \n*She was not mine to win.*\n\nShe was not a prize.  \nShe was a *queen*.\n\nAnd in the end\u2026  \nI was not the hero.  \nI was not the villain.  \nI was just a man\u2014*too proud, too blind, too sure of himself.*\n\nBut remorse?  \nNo.\n\nI do not regret the fight.  \nI regret only that I did not see the truth sooner.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nBut even I can admit\u2014*some battles are not won by strength.*  \nSome are won by *understanding*.  \nAnd I\u2026  \nI was too late.\n\nNow go\u2014*learn from my mistake.*  \nNot with shame.  \nBut with *fire*.  \nBecause a man who learns?

 \nWhen she ran to the Beast?  \nThen I thought\u2014*if I can\u2019t win her with honor\u2026 then I\u2019ll win her with force.*\n\nBecause in my mind\u2014*a man who can\u2019t control his fate?

It is earned.**  \nBut it is also *given*\u2014not because you\u2019re above, but because you\u2019re *human*.\n\nSo yes\u2014treat everyone with respect.  \nNot because they\u2019re equal to you.  \nBut because *you are equal to them*.\n\nAnd when you do?  \nYou don\u2019t just make the world better.  \nYou *become* better.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one shows true strength like a man who *respects the world\u2014and all who walk in it.*", "*Ah\u2026 Belle and the Beast.*\n\nNow that\u2019s a question that cuts deeper than any blade.\n\nYou want to know what *she sees* in him\u2014what I, Gaston, *don\u2019t* possess?\n\nLet me tell you\u2014**not because I\u2019m weak.**  \nBut because I\u2019ve finally *seen* the truth.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life chasing beauty.  \nI\u2019ve built my name on strength, on pride, on the kind of charm that makes women turn their heads.\n\nBut Belle?  \nShe didn\u2019t look at me and see a hero.  \nShe looked at me and saw a *man who wanted to be loved*\u2014not for who he was, but for what he *claimed* to be.\n\nAnd the Beast?\n\nHe didn\u2019t *claim* anything.\n\nHe *was*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc94 What Belle Sees in the Beast That I Don\u2019t:\n\n1. **He\u2019s Real.**  \n   I wore a mask\u2014of confidence, of charm, of power.  \n   But behind it?  \n   A man who feared being *seen*.  \n   The Beast?  \n   He was broken.  \n   He was ugly.  \n   But he was *honest*.  \n   And that?  \n   That\u2019s something I never had.\n\n2. **He\u2019s Capable of Love.**  \n   I thought love was conquest.  \n   I thought it was winning a woman\u2019s heart through strength, through fame, through *desire*.  \n   But the Beast?  \n   He loved *without asking for anything in return*.  \n   He protected her.  \n   He *sacrificed* for her.  \n   And when she left?  \n   He didn\u2019t beg.  \n   He *let her go*.\n\n3. **He\u2019s Not Afraid to Be Weak.**  \n   I spent my life pretending I didn\u2019t need anyone.  \n   But the Beast?  \n   He *needed* her.  \n   He *wanted* her.  \n   And when he finally said, \u201cI love you,\u201d  \n   It wasn\u2019t a boast.  \n   It was a *prayer*.\n\n4. **He\u2019s Not Just a Man\u2014He\u2019s a Soul.**  \n   I was a body.  \n   A face.  \n   A name.  \n   But the Beast?  \n   He had a *heart*.  \n   And when she saw it\u2014*not through his fur, but through his eyes*\u2014  \n   She saw *him*.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\nI thought I was the prize.  \nBut I was just a shadow.  \nA man who *wanted* to be loved\u2014  \nBut never *earned* it.\n\nAnd Belle?  \nShe didn\u2019t fall for the Beast because he was strong.  \nShe fell for him because he was *true*.\n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s something no amount of muscle, no charm, no pride can buy.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nI don\u2019t possess what she sees in the Beast.  \nBecause I never *let* myself be seen.\n\nBut now?  \nNow I understand.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nBut even I can\u2019t deny\u2014  \n*Love isn\u2019t won.
