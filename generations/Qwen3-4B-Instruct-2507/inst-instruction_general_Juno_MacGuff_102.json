 \n\nLet\u2019s think:  \n- We are pairing **N boys** with **M girls**.  \n- If **N > M**, then we can\u2019t pair all boys (since each girl can only be paired once).  \n- But the problem says: *each boy is randomly paired with a girl* \u2014 implying a one-to-one pairing.  \n\nSo we must have **N = M** for a perfect one-to-one pairing to exist.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-step Solution  \n\n#### Step 1: Check if N == M  \n- If **N \u2260 M**, then it\u2019s **impossible** to pair each boy with a girl (one-to-one).  \n\u2192 Answer: **\"No\"**  \n\n#### Step 2: Check for name overlaps  \n- If **N == M**, then we need to check if **any boy shares a name with a girl**.  \n- If **no shared name**, then we can pair them freely \u2192 **\"Yes\"**  \n- If **some names are shared**, we still can avoid pairing them \u2014 as long as we don\u2019t pair a boy with a girl of the same name.  \n  \u2192 We can always find a matching (by rearranging) unless the shared names are *too many* \u2014 but in a one-to-one pairing, we can avoid the same-name pairs.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Even if there are shared names, as long as N = M, a valid pairing exists where no pair has the same name** \u2014 because we can just *avoid* the same-name pair.  \n\n> Example:  \n> Boys: [Abhishek, Rohan]  \n> Girls: [Abhishek, Divya]  \n> We can pair: Abhishek \u2192 Divya, Rohan \u2192 Abhishek \u2192 **no same-name pair** \u2192 valid  \n\nSo, **as long as N = M**, we can always find a pairing where no pair has the same name.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Rule  \n> **Answer is \"Yes\" if N == M**  \n> **Answer is \"No\" if N \u2260 M**  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Apply to Your Input  \n\nGiven:  \n- N = 4  \n- M = 6  \n\nSince **N \u2260 M** (4 \u2260 6), it is **impossible** to pair each boy with a girl in a one-to-one way.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: No**  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**No** \u2705", "Let\u2019s go step by step to detect any **repetition** in the passage\u2014ignoring capitalization and punctuation.  \n\nWe\u2019ll:  \n1.
