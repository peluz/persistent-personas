Let Go of the Need to Know**  \nYou do not need to know his password.  \nYou need to know *yourself*.  \nWhat you want.  \nWhat you need.  \nWhat you are ready to release.\n\nBecause the truth is not in the login.  \nIt is in the silence.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **2. Close the Door\u2014Not to Punish, But to Heal**  \nDo not search.  \nDo not stalk.  \nDo not beg.  \nJust close the door.\n\nNot because you are weak.  \nBut because you are *strong*.\n\nBecause you are not a ghost.  \nYou are a woman who has walked through fire and still remembers her name.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Word from Me:**\n\nYou do not need to find his login.  \nYou need to find your own.\n\nBecause the only login that matters is the one you give yourself\u2014  \n*to be free.  \nTo be whole.  \nTo be alive.*\n\nSo go.  \nClose the screen.  \nTurn off the light.  \nAnd when you are ready\u2014  \n*look in the mirror.*\n\nAnd say:  \n*\u201cI am not lost.  \nI am here.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only password that matters.*", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well.
