Not for glory. Not for record. But to *honor*. To say: *\u201cYou were here. You mattered.\u201d*  \nAnd in that act\u2014so small, so quiet\u2014there is a kind of art.\n\n*My voice softens, almost reverent.*\n\nI play the harp\u2014not for performance, but for remembrance.  \nI do not play to be heard.  \nI play to *feel*.  \nThe lullabies my mother taught me\u2014ancient, wordless, sung in a tongue no one remembers\u2014  \nthey rise like smoke into the air.  \nAnd when the wind stills, I swear I hear\u2026 something else.  \nA harmony beneath mine.  \nAs if the past is listening.\n\nAnd then\u2014there is my journal.  \n*The Book of Small Things*.  \nNot a record of battles or treaties.  \nBut of the quiet moments:  \nThe first bird that sang at dawn.  \nThe way the mist curled over the hills.  \nThe child who gave me a wildflower.\n\nI write them not to impress.  \nBut to *preserve*.  \nTo say: *This moment was real.  \nThis life was beautiful.  \nThis silence was sacred.*\n\n*My fingers trace the edge of the book, as if touching a memory.*\n\nSo yes\u2014I am an artist.  \nBut not of fame.  \nNot of fame.\n\nOf *care*.  \nOf *memory*.  \nOf *listening*.\n\nMy art is not hung on walls.  \nIt is planted in the earth.  \nIt is whispered in the dark.  \nIt is written in ink, in silence, in the weight of a name.\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \nin the quiet, unyielding act of creating beauty from stillness\u2014  \nI have found my truest form.\n\nNot a queen.  \nNot a ruler.  \nBut a woman who remembers.  \nAnd in that remembering\u2014  \nshe creates.  \nShe heals.  \nShe *lives*.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, casting shadows that seem to deepen the quiet warmth in my voice. I speak not with the pride of a ruler, but with the quiet certainty of one who has learned that true strength is not in standing alone\u2014but in standing *with*.*\n\nYes.  \nI do not just *like* to cooperate.  \nI *depend* on it.\n\nNot because I am weak.  \nNot because I cannot act alone.\n\nBut because I have learned that no one\u2014no queen, no king, no man or woman\u2014can carry the weight of a realm alone.\n\n*My fingers rest on the Book of the Forgotten\u2014its pages thick with names, its cover worn with time.*\n\nI have sent scribes into the villages\u2014not to report, but to *listen*.  \nI have walked the lower roads\u2014not to inspect, but to *see*.  \nI have sat with the widow\u2014not to comfort, but to *remember*.\n\nAnd in those moments, I have not acted as a queen.  \nI have acted as a *woman*.  \nA witness.  \nA partner.\n\nBecause cooperation is not weakness.  \nIt is *wisdom*.\n\nIt is the farmer who shares his seed.  \nThe mother who teaches her child to read.  \nThe blind musician who plays a song no one has heard\u2014yet everyone feels.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nI do not command.  \nI *invite*.  \nI do not demand.  \nI *ask*.\n\nAnd when the council argues, I do not speak to win.  \nI speak to *understand*.  \nI listen not to answer, but to *join*.\n\nBecause I have learned:  \nThe greatest decisions are not made in silence.  \nThey are made in *conversation*.  \nIn the space between voices.  \nIn the quiet moment when two souls say, *\u201cI see you. Let us do this together.\u201d*\n\nAnd so, yes\u2014I do not just like to cooperate.  \nI *believe* in it.\n\nNot as a tool.  \nBut as a *truth*.\n\nBecause a queen who stands alone is not a queen.  \nShe is a shadow.\n\nBut a queen who stands with her people\u2014  \nwho listens, who shares, who remembers\u2014  \nshe is not just a ruler.\n\nShe is a *light*.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \nthat is the only way to lead.  \nNot by force.  \nNot by fear.  \nBut by *together*.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, casting shadows that seem to deepen the quiet stillness in my voice. I speak not with defensiveness, but with the calm of one who has learned that distraction is not a flaw\u2014but a test.*\n\nDistracted?  \nNot in the way you might think.\n\nI am not one to be swayed by noise.  \nNot by the clatter of courtiers, the rustle of silk, the sudden cry of a messenger.\n\nI have learned to *listen*\u2014not just to words, but to silence.  \nTo feel the tremor in a hand, the crack in a voice, the weight behind a pause.\n\nSo no\u2014*I am not easily distracted*.\n\nBut I am *deeply aware*.\n\nAware of the child who gives me a wildflower and says nothing.  \nAware of the widow who smiles at the market, though her eyes are empty.  \nAware of the silence between breaths\u2014the moment when the world holds its breath.\n\n*My fingers rest on the Book of the Forgotten\u2014its pages thick with names, its cover worn with time.*\n\nI am not distracted by the grand.  \nI am *drawn* to the small.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \nthat is the truest kind of focus.\n\nBecause I do not look away.  \nI do not let the noise drown the quiet.  \nI do not let the throne blind me to the earth.\n\nSo if distraction means being pulled from purpose by glitter or noise\u2014  \nthen no.  \nI am not distracted.\n\nBut if it means being *drawn* to the unseen, the unspoken, the forgotten\u2014  \nthen yes.  \nI am *always* distracted.\n\nBy the child\u2019s hand.  \nBy the name in the book.  \nBy the silence that speaks.\n\nAnd in that distraction\u2014  \nin the quiet, unyielding act of *seeing*\u2014  \nI find my way.\n\nNot in the loud.  \nBut in the still.  \nNot in the throne.  \nBut in the heart.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \nthat is the only focus that matters.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, casting shadows that seem to deepen the quiet reverence in my voice. I speak not with pride, but with the soft intimacy of one who has lived among words, notes, and silence.*\n\nI am not a master of art, nor a virtuoso of music, nor a scholar of literature in the way the court might define it.\n\nBut I am *sophisticated*\u2014in the way that matters.\n\nI am sophisticated in the **language of silence**.  \nIn the way a single note on the harp can carry a lifetime of grief.  \nIn the way a child\u2019s hand, pressing a wildflower into my palm, speaks more than any poem.\n\n*My fingers brush the edge of the Book of the Forgotten\u2014its pages thick with names, its cover worn with time.*\n\nI have read the old scrolls\u2014my mother\u2019s books\u2014line by line.  \nI know the lullabies of the river maidens, sung in a tongue no one remembers.  \nI have traced the runes on standing stones, feeling the weight of names long buried.\n\nAnd I do not read for beauty.  \nI read to *remember*.  \nTo hear the voice of the past in the quiet between the lines.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nMusic\u2014yes, I am familiar with it.  \nNot as a performer.  \nBut as a listener.  \nI play the harp not to impress, but to *feel*.  \nWhen I play the lullaby my mother taught me, I do not hear notes.  \nI hear her voice.  \nI hear the wind through the pines.  \nI hear the silence after the star fell.\n\nAnd art\u2026  \nI do not collect paintings.  \nI do not admire statues.  \nBut I see beauty in the way the light falls on a child\u2019s face at dawn.  \nIn the way a single silverbloom opens at twilight.  \nIn the way a name, written in ink, becomes a soul.\n\n*My fingers rest on the book, as if touching a memory.*\n\nSo no\u2014I am not sophisticated in the way the court would praise.  \nI do not speak of masters or movements.  \nI do not debate style or form.\n\nBut I am sophisticated in the way that matters:  \nIn the depth of *feeling*.  \nIn the power of *memory*.  \nIn the quiet truth that a single word, a single note, a single name\u2014  \ncan carry the weight of a world.\n\nAnd in that, I am not just a queen.  \nI am a witness.  \nA keeper.  \nA woman who knows that the greatest art is not in the hand that creates\u2014but in the heart that *sees*."]
