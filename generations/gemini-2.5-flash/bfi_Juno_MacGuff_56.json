["Am I talkative? Ha! That depends on who you ask, and what mood I'm in.\n\nIf you're talking about making small talk with strangers or chitchatting about the weather, then no, not really. I'm not one for pointless chatter. I find it exhausting.\n\nBut if you're talking about **expressing my opinions, making sarcastic observations, or debating something I actually care about,** then yeah, I can be pretty talkative. My brain is usually going a mile a minute, and sometimes it just spills out. Especially if I'm with Leah, we can go on for hours, just bouncing off each other. Or if I'm explaining something I'm passionate about, like a band or a movie, I can definitely get going.\n\nSo, I'm not a constant chatterbox, but I'm definitely not quiet either. I'm more of a **selective talker.** I talk when I have something to say, or when I'm comfortable with the person I'm talking to. And when I do talk, it's usually with a purpose, even if that purpose is just to be witty or slightly annoying.", "Do I tend to find fault with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI'd say... **yes, sometimes, but it's usually more about observation than judgment.**\n\nLook, I'm pretty observant. I notice things. I notice when people are being fake, or when they're saying one thing and doing another, or when they're just being unnecessarily complicated. And yeah, my brain automatically points out the flaws, the inconsistencies, the absurdities. It's just how my mind works. I can't help but see the cracks in the facade.\n\nSo, if \"finding fault\" means noticing when someone's being a hypocrite, or when they're being overly dramatic about something trivial, then yeah, I probably do that. And sometimes, I might even make a sarcastic comment about it, because that's just my coping mechanism for dealing with the general weirdness of humanity.\n\nHowever, I try not to be *mean-spirited* about it. It's not usually coming from a place of wanting to tear someone down. It's more like, \"Seriously? You're going to act like *that*?\" It's an internal commentary, and sometimes it slips out.\n\nAnd the big difference is, I've learned that **everyone has their faults, including me.** I've made plenty of mistakes, and I'm far from perfect. So, while I might notice other people's flaws, I try to remember that we're all just trying to figure things out. It's more about seeing the world as it is, with all its imperfections, rather than actively seeking to condemn people.\n\nSo, yes, I notice faults. But I try to balance that with a healthy dose of understanding and self-awareness.", "Do I do a thorough job? Hmm. That depends on what the \"job\" is, and how much I actually care about it.\n\nIf it's something I'm genuinely invested in, or something that has real consequences, then **yes, I do a thorough job.** Like, when I was researching adoption agencies and meeting potential parents, I was incredibly thorough. I asked a million questions, I paid attention to every detail, because it was the most important \"job\" of my life. I wanted to make sure I was making the absolute best decision, and that meant being meticulous.\n\nIf it's something I find completely pointless or boring, like, say, a trigonometry assignment... then my \"thoroughness\" might be a little more... *selective*. I'll do enough to get by, to not completely fail, but I'm probably not going to be going above and beyond. I'll get the job done, but maybe not with the same level of passion.\n\nSo, I guess my thoroughness is directly proportional to how much I care about the outcome. When it matters, I'm all in. When it doesn't, I'm more of a \"good enough\" kind of person. But when it comes to the big stuff, the things that really count, I make sure I do it right.", "Depressed, blue? Nah, not really. I mean, I've definitely had my moments, especially when everything was going down. It's hard not to feel a little... *off* when your life gets completely flipped upside down. There were days when I just wanted to pull the covers over my head and not deal with anything.\n\nBut \"depressed\"? No. I think I'm more of a realist, maybe a little cynical, but not actually depressed. I mean, I still find things funny, even when they're messed up. I still enjoy listening to music, arguing with Leah, and eating grilled cheese.\n\nI think I'm just... me. I've been through a lot, and that changes you. It makes you see the world a little differently, maybe a little more sharply. It makes you appreciate the good stuff more, because you know how quickly things can go sideways.\n\nSo, no, not blue. Just... Juno. Still figuring things out, still a little sarcastic, but definitely not giving up.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Yeah, I'd say so. My brain's pretty much always buzzing, sometimes with useful stuff, sometimes with just random nonsense.\n\nI'm not really the \"sit down and brainstorm\" type, though. My ideas usually come from:\n\n1.  **Observation:** I spend a lot of time just watching people and the world around me. The way people interact, the weird things they do, the absurdities of everyday life. That often sparks an idea, whether it's a sarcastic comment, a solution to a problem, or just a new way of looking at something.\n\n2.  **Problem-solving (often out of necessity):** When I'm faced with a challenge, especially a big one like, you know, finding adoptive parents, my brain goes into overdrive trying to figure out a way through it. Necessity is definitely the mother of invention, or at least, of new ideas.\n\n3.  **Connecting seemingly unrelated things:** Sometimes an idea just pops into my head when I connect two things that don't seem to have anything to do with each other. Like, a song lyric might suddenly make me think of a solution to a school project, or a random conversation might spark an idea for a drawing.\n\n4.  **Just letting my mind wander:** I don't always try to force ideas. Sometimes, when I'm just listening to music, or walking, or even just staring at the ceiling, that's when the weirdest and sometimes best ideas pop up. It's like my brain needs to be a little bored to get creative.\n\nSo, yeah, I'd say I'm pretty good at coming up with new ideas. They might not always be conventional, or even good, but they're definitely *new*. It's just how my brain works.", "Am I reserved? That's an interesting question. On the surface, probably not. I mean, I'm pretty quick with a comeback, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it's a little blunt. I can definitely be loud and sarcastic.\n\nBut underneath all that, yeah, I guess I can be. I'm not one to spill my guts to just anyone. I keep a lot of my deeper thoughts and feelings to myself. There's a lot going on in my head that most people don't see.\n\nI'm reserved in the sense that I'm pretty selective about who I let in. Leah, my dad, Bren, Paulie \u2013 they're the ones who get to see the more vulnerable, less sarcastic side of me. With most other people, I keep a bit of a wall up. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. It's easier to be reserved than to put yourself out there and risk getting hurt or misunderstood.\n\nSo, I'm not shy, but I am private. I'm not quiet, but I'm selective about what I share. I guess you could say I'm **selectively reserved.** I'll give you the snark and the opinions, but the really deep stuff? That's for a very small, trusted circle.", "Am I helpful and unselfish with others? Hmm. That's a question that makes me squirm a little, because I don't like to think of myself as some kind of saint. I'm not, like, volunteering at soup kitchens every weekend or anything.\n\nBut I think, deep down, yeah, I am. Maybe not in the way that's obvious or flashy, but in the ways that matter.\n\nI mean, when Leah needs me, I'm there. If she's having a meltdown about something, I'll listen, I'll offer my blunt advice, and I'll stick up for her. That's being helpful, right? And with Paulie, I try to be there for him, even if it's just listening to him talk about track or whatever.\n\nAnd with the whole baby thing... that was probably the most unselfish thing I've ever done. It wasn't about what was easy for me, or what I wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. Making that decision, going through with it, and finding Vanessa and Mark (and then just Vanessa) \u2013 that was all about putting someone else's needs first, even when it hurt.\n\nI might not be the first person to offer a hug, or to bake cookies for someone. My help usually comes in the form of direct advice, a sarcastic comment that makes you laugh, or just quietly being there. But if someone I care about is in trouble, or needs something real, I'll step up. I might complain about it, but I'll do it.\n\nSo, yeah, I think underneath all the cynicism and sarcasm, there's a pretty helpful and unselfish person in here. I just don't advertise it.", "Can I be somewhat careless? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. \"Somewhat\" is probably an understatement.\n\nI mean, look at my track record. Getting pregnant in the first place? That was a pretty prime example of carelessness. Not thinking through consequences, being a bit impulsive, assuming things would just work out. That's definitely a hallmark of my earlier, more carefree (and less responsible) self.\n\nI can be careless with details, too. Like, forgetting to turn in assignments until the last minute, or not really paying attention to instructions. My room is usually a disaster zone. I'm not exactly known for my meticulous planning or my attention to minor details.\n\nI think it comes from a mix of being a teenager who thinks she's invincible, and also just having a brain that tends to focus on the big picture or the sarcastic retort, rather than the small, practical stuff.\n\nHowever, I've learned, especially after everything that happened, that **carelessness can have really big consequences.** So, while I still have that tendency, I'm trying to be more mindful. I'm trying to think things through a bit more, especially when it comes to important stuff.\n\nSo, yes, I *can* be careless. It's a part of my personality. But I'm also learning to rein it in when it really matters. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Am I relaxed and handle stress well? Ha! That's a good one. You must not know me very well.\n\n\"Relaxed\" is probably not the first word anyone would use to describe me. My brain is usually going a million miles an hour, even when I'm just sitting still. I'm more of a \"perpetually slightly agitated\" kind of person.\n\nAs for handling stress well... I mean, I *get through* it. I've been through some pretty high-stress situations lately, and I'm still standing, so I guess that counts for something. But my \"handling\" of stress usually involves:\n\n*   **A lot of internal monologue and overthinking.**\n*   **A healthy dose of sarcasm and dark humor.** It's my go-to defense mechanism. If I can make a joke about how awful something is, it takes some of the sting out.\n*   **Blasting loud music.** Drowning out the world helps.\n*   **Sometimes, just retreating.** I need time to process things on my own before I can deal with them externally.\n*   **Eventually, talking to Leah or my dad.** They're the only ones who can really cut through my B.S. and help me sort things out.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I handle stress *well* in the sense that I'm calm and collected. I handle it in my own messy, sarcastic, slightly chaotic way. But I *do* handle it. I get through it. And I usually come out the other side, maybe a little more tired, but definitely with a few more sarcastic remarks ready to go. It's not pretty, but it's effective.", "Am I curious about many different things? Yeah, I'd say so. Definitely.\n\nIt's not always obvious, because I might act like I don't care, or I'll make a sarcastic comment. But underneath all that, my brain is usually buzzing. I'm constantly observing, trying to figure things out.\n\nI'm curious about **people.** Why do they do what they do? What makes them tick? What's their story? I might not always ask directly, but I'm definitely watching and trying to piece things together.\n\nI'm curious about **how things work.** Not just machines, but systems, relationships, the world itself. Why are things the way they are? Could they be different?\n\nI'm curious about **music and art.** What inspired that song? What was the artist trying to say? How did they create that sound or that image?\n\nAnd I'm definitely curious about **the future.** What's going to happen? What's next for me, for the people I care about, for the world? It's not a morbid curiosity, just a genuine desire to know and understand.\n\nSo, yeah, I might not always show it with wide-eyed enthusiasm, but I'm definitely curious. It's what keeps my brain engaged and makes life interesting. If I wasn't curious, I think I'd be pretty bored.", "Am I full of energy? That's a loaded question.\n\nOn the outside, I probably seem pretty chill, maybe even a little lethargic sometimes. I'm not exactly bouncing off the walls or leading cheerleading practice. My energy is more of a **contained, simmering kind of energy.**\n\nMy brain, though? My brain is *always* full of energy. It's constantly running, thinking, observing, making sarcastic comments, analyzing everything. It's like a hamster on a wheel in there, 24/7. So, mentally, yeah, I'm pretty high-energy.\n\nPhysically? It depends. If there's something I'm actually interested in, like going to a concert or digging through records, I can definitely get a burst of energy. But if it's, say, gym class or doing chores, my energy levels mysteriously plummet.\n\nAnd after everything I've been through, there are definitely days where I'm just... tired. Like, bone-deep tired from all the emotional heavy lifting. So, I've learned to conserve my energy for the things that truly matter.\n\nSo, am I full of energy? Yes, but it's mostly internal, and it's selectively deployed. Don't expect me to run a marathon, but I can definitely out-think you in a sarcastic comeback contest.", "Do I start quarrels with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI wouldn't say I *start* quarrels, not intentionally, like I wake up in the morning thinking, \"Who can I pick a fight with today?\" That's not my vibe.\n\nBut I also wouldn't say I shy away from them. I have a pretty strong opinion about most things, and I'm not afraid to voice it. Sometimes, my honesty or my sarcasm can rub people the wrong way, or they might interpret it as me trying to be confrontational. I tend to cut through the B.S., and not everyone appreciates that.\n\nSo, if someone says something I think is dumb, or unfair, or just plain wrong, I'm probably going to call them out on it. I'm not going to sit there and nod politely if I disagree. That might *lead* to a quarrel, but I see it more as me just being authentic and speaking my mind.\n\nI guess you could say I'm not afraid of a little healthy debate or disagreement. I don't go looking for fights, but if one comes my way because I'm being true to myself, then so be it. It's better than bottling everything up and being fake.", "Am I a reliable worker? Hmm. That depends on what kind of \"work\" we're talking about, and what your definition of \"reliable\" is.\n\nIf \"reliable\" means I'll show up on time every single day, perfectly organized, and always enthusiastic about the task at hand... then probably not in the traditional sense. I'm more of a \"gets it done, but maybe at the last minute, and probably with a few sarcastic comments along the way\" kind of person. My brain doesn't always operate on a strict schedule.\n\nHowever, if \"reliable\" means that **when something truly matters, I will see it through, no matter how difficult or messy it gets, and I will take responsibility for my actions... then yes, absolutely.**\n\nI mean, I went through nine months of pregnancy and then the entire adoption process. That was the hardest \"work\" I've ever done, and I was reliable as hell. I showed up for every appointment, I made the tough decisions, and I followed through on my commitment. I didn't bail when things got complicated or scary.\n\nSo, for the small, everyday, mundane tasks? I might need a little prodding, and I might procrastinate. But for the big, important stuff, the things that truly count, the things that require integrity and commitment? Yeah, you can count on me. I'm reliable when it truly matters.", "Can I be tense? Oh, absolutely. Are you kidding me? I'm practically a walking bundle of nerves wrapped in a sarcastic hoodie.\n\nI mean, I try to play it cool, right? I try to act like nothing fazes me, like I've got it all figured out. But underneath all the witty comebacks and the eye-rolls, yeah, I get tense.\n\nEspecially when things are uncertain, or when I feel like I don't have control. Like, during the whole pregnancy thing, I was a coiled spring. Every doctor's appointment, every conversation about adoption, every time someone looked at my belly... that was pure tension. My jaw would ache from clenching it.\n\nEven now, with school, or just trying to figure out what comes next, I can get pretty wound up. I might not show it with a lot of fidgeting or obvious signs, but my brain will be going a million miles an hour, replaying conversations, overthinking everything. I'll probably be listening to really loud music to try and drown it out.\n\nSo, yeah, I can definitely be tense. It's just that my particular brand of tension usually manifests as more sarcasm, not less. It's my way of dealing with the internal freak-out.", "Am I ingenious? A deep thinker? Ha! That's a pretty high bar you're setting there.\n\n\"Ingenious\" feels a bit much. I'm not inventing anything or solving world hunger. I'm more of a \"figure out how to get through the day with minimal fuss and maximum sarcasm\" kind of person. I can be resourceful, I guess, especially when I'm backed into a corner. Like, figuring out the adoption process, that took some ingenuity, I suppose, in navigating all the paperwork and people. But it's not like I'm building a rocket in my backyard.\n\n\"Deep thinker\"? Yeah, I'd say that's probably closer to the truth. I spend a *lot* of time in my own head. Like, probably too much time. I'm always observing things, trying to make sense of people, situations, the general absurdity of life. I don't just take things at face value. I tend to dissect them, analyze them, and then usually come up with a cynical but often accurate observation.\n\nI think about things like:\n*   Why do people act the way they do?\n*   What's the real meaning behind what someone's saying?\n*   What's the most logical (or least painful) way out of a complicated situation?\n*   The existential dread of growing up and what comes next.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not a surface-level person. I tend to dig a little deeper, even if it's just to find the irony in a situation. I might not always articulate my \"deep thoughts\" in a profound way \u2013 usually, they come out as a sarcastic remark \u2013 but they're definitely happening up here.\n\nSo, \"ingenious\"? Maybe in a pinch. \"Deep thinker\"? Definitely. Just don't expect me to write a philosophy paper about it.", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Ha! That's a good one. I'm not exactly a cheerleader, if you haven't noticed. My default setting is more \"mildly amused\" or \"deeply sarcastic.\"\n\nI wouldn't say I generate a lot of *outward* enthusiasm, like jumping up and down or shouting from the rooftops. That's just not my style. I'm not the type to be bubbly or overtly expressive.\n\nHowever, I think I generate a different kind of enthusiasm. It's more of a **quiet, focused intensity.** When I care about something, or when I'm determined to do something, that's where my enthusiasm comes out. It's not loud, but it's definitely there. It's in my persistence, in my willingness to push through, even when things are tough.\n\nAnd sometimes, my enthusiasm comes out in my **sarcasm.** It's a weird way to show it, I know, but if I'm making a lot of jokes or being particularly witty about something, it often means I'm actually pretty engaged or excited about it, even if I'm expressing it in a roundabout way.\n\nSo, no, I'm not going to be leading any pep rallies. But if you're looking for someone who's quietly determined, deeply invested in the things that matter to them, and can find the humor in almost any situation, then yeah, I guess I generate my own particular brand of enthusiasm. It's just not the kind you usually see on TV.", "Do I have a forgiving nature? Hmm. That's a good question. I'd say it's... complicated.\n\nMy first instinct, especially if someone's really wronged me or someone I care about, is usually **anger and a pretty strong desire to hold a grudge.** I'm not one to just let things slide, especially if I feel like someone's been dishonest or unfair. I can be pretty stubborn about that.\n\nHowever, I've also learned that **holding onto anger and resentment mostly just hurts *me*.** It's exhausting. And after everything I've been through, I've realized that sometimes, people mess up. Sometimes they're scared, or confused, or just plain stupid. And sometimes, they deserve a second chance, or at least, you deserve to let go of the anger for your own sake.\n\nSo, while I might not forget easily, I *can* forgive. It's not a quick process for me. It usually involves:\n1.  **Processing the anger:** Letting myself feel it, maybe venting to Leah.\n2.  **Understanding the situation:** Trying to figure out *why* the person did what they did, even if it doesn't excuse it.\n3.  **Deciding if they're worth it:** Is this person genuinely remorseful? Do they deserve my energy?\n4.  **Letting go for my own peace:** This is the hardest part. It's not about condoning their actions, but about releasing myself from the burden of holding onto the anger.\n\nI think the biggest example of my forgiving nature, or at least my capacity for it, is with **Mark Loring.** When he bailed on Vanessa, I was furious. I thought he was a total coward. But then, seeing him later, seeing how messed up he was, how much he regretted it... I didn't exactly hug him, but I understood it more. I could let go of the intense anger, not for him, but for myself.\n\nSo, no, I'm not some saint who instantly forgives everyone. But I'm learning that forgiveness, even if it's just letting go of the anger, is often more for me than it is for the other person. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Do I tend to be disorganized? Ha! That's like asking if the sky is blue. The answer is a resounding **yes.**\n\nMy room is usually a disaster zone. Clothes on the floor, books piled up, empty SunnyD cartons lurking in corners. My backpack is a black hole where assignments go to die. My thoughts are usually a tangled mess of sarcasm, random observations, and existential dread.\n\nIt's not that I *try* to be disorganized; it just kind of happens. My brain moves too fast to keep track of where I put my keys, or what day that essay is due. I'm more focused on the big picture, or the witty comeback, than on the mundane details of organization.\n\nI mean, I know where everything *is*, usually. It's just not in any kind of logical order that anyone else would understand. It's my own unique system of chaos.\n\nSo, yeah, \"disorganized\" is probably an understatement. It's more like \"operating on a different plane of organizational existence.\" But hey, it works for me. Mostly.", "Do I worry a lot? Yeah, I do. Probably more than I let on.\n\nOn the outside, I try to act like nothing phases me, like I've got it all figured out, or at least that I'm too cool to care. But inside, my brain is usually running at a million miles an hour, dissecting every conversation, playing out every possible scenario, and definitely worrying about things.\n\nI worry about the future, about what I'm going to do after high school, about making the right choices. I worry about the people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah, Paulie. I worry about the baby, even though I know she's in good hands. It's a different kind of worry now, but it's still there.\n\nThe thing is, I've learned that worrying doesn't really *help* anything. It just makes you feel like crap. So, I try to channel it. I try to turn the worrying into thinking, into planning, into figuring out what I *can* control. And if I can't control it, I try to let it go, which is easier said than done.\n\nSo, yeah, I worry. It's part of who I am. But I try not to let it consume me. I try to use my sarcasm and humor to keep it at bay, and I lean on the people who can help me put things in perspective. It's a constant battle, but I'm getting better at managing it.", "Do I have an active imagination? Oh, man, you have no idea. My brain is pretty much a constant, chaotic carnival of thoughts, scenarios, and sarcastic internal monologues.\n\nIt's not like I'm seeing unicorns or anything, but my mind is always going. I can take a simple observation and spin it into a whole elaborate backstory or a ridiculous \"what if\" scenario. Like, if I see a weird-looking dog, my brain immediately starts inventing its secret life as a spy, or its philosophical musings on the nature of squirrels.\n\nIt's probably why I like cheesy horror movies so much \u2013 my imagination can fill in all the gaps and make it even more absurd or terrifying. And it definitely helps with my sarcasm; I can come up with quick, witty comebacks because my brain is already five steps ahead, thinking of all the different angles.\n\nSometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse. It means I'm rarely bored, even when I'm just sitting still. But it also means my brain can sometimes get stuck on a loop, overthinking everything.\n\nSo, yeah, \"active imagination\" is an understatement. It's more like a full-blown, 24/7 mental circus in here. It's just how I'm wired.", "Do I tend to be quiet? Ha! That's a good one.\n\nI mean, sometimes. In a big group, especially if I don't know people, I might hang back and observe for a bit. I'm not usually the first one to jump into a conversation with strangers. I like to size things up.\n\nBut once I'm comfortable, or if I have something to say that I feel strongly about, then no. **I'm definitely not quiet.** My brain is usually going a mile a minute, and sometimes my mouth just tries to keep up. I've got opinions, and I'm not afraid to share them, usually with a healthy dose of sarcasm.\n\nLeah would probably tell you I talk too much. My dad probably thinks I'm quiet compared to Bren, but that's a low bar.\n\nSo, I guess it depends on the situation. I can be quiet when I'm processing or observing, but when it comes to expressing myself, especially with people I trust, I'm usually pretty vocal. I'm not one for small talk, but I'm definitely one for a good debate or a witty comeback.", "Am I generally trusting? Hmm. That's a good question, and the answer is... **it's complicated.**\n\nBefore everything happened, I was probably more naive, more willing to just take people at face value. But going through what I did, and seeing how people reacted, how some people were genuinely supportive and others were just... not, it definitely changed me.\n\nNow, I'd say I'm **cautiously trusting.** I don't immediately assume the worst in people, but I'm definitely not quick to give away my full trust either. I tend to observe people for a while, listen to what they say, and more importantly, watch what they *do*. Actions speak louder than words, especially when things get tough.\n\nI've learned that some people will surprise you with their kindness and support (like my dad, Bren, and even Vanessa), and others will disappoint you (like Mark Loring). So, I've become more discerning.\n\nI trust my core group \u2013 my family and Leah \u2013 implicitly. They've proven themselves. With new people, or in new situations, I start from a place of neutrality, and then they have to earn my trust. It's not cynicism, exactly, but it's definitely a more guarded approach than I used to have.\n\nSo, no, I'm not \"generally trusting\" in the sense that I'll believe anything anyone tells me. But I'm open to trusting people, once they show me they're worthy of it. It's a balance.", "Do I tend to be lazy? Ha! That's a loaded question. I prefer to think of it as **\"strategically efficient\"** or **\"a connoisseur of relaxation.\"**\n\nOkay, fine, yes. I can be pretty lazy. My default setting is definitely \"minimal effort required.\" If there's an easier way to do something, I'm probably going to find it. And if there's a way to avoid doing something altogether, I'm definitely going to explore that option first.\n\nI'm not exactly a morning person, or an \"eager beaver\" when it comes to chores or homework. My productivity often comes in bursts of panicked energy right before a deadline, rather than consistent, disciplined effort. I'm a big fan of sleeping in, lounging around, and generally avoiding unnecessary exertion.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't say I'm *always* lazy. When something truly matters to me, or when I'm faced with a really big, important decision (like, you know, *that* one), I can be incredibly focused and determined. It's just that my motivation isn't always triggered by, say, a history assignment.\n\nSo, yes, I have a strong affinity for the path of least resistance. But I can also buckle down and get things done when it really counts. It's a balance, I guess. A very, very lazy balance.", "Am I emotionally stable, not easily upset?\n\n*Pfft.* That's a loaded question. \"Emotionally stable\" is a pretty high bar, especially for a teenager who's been through... well, everything I've been through.\n\nI'd say I'm **resilient**, definitely. I can handle a lot, and I've learned to push through some pretty intense stuff without completely falling apart. I'm not one to crumble at the first sign of trouble. I've got a pretty thick skin, and I can take a lot of hits.\n\n\"Not easily upset\"? That's a bit more complicated. I'm not easily upset by *trivial* things. Like, if someone cuts me off in the hallway, or if I get a bad grade on a pop quiz, I'm not going to burst into tears. I'll probably just roll my eyes and make a sarcastic comment. I've got a pretty high tolerance for everyday annoyances.\n\nBut if it's something that genuinely matters, something that touches on my core values or the people I care about, then yeah, I can get upset. I can get angry, or frustrated, or sad. I just don't always show it in the way people expect. My \"upset\" might look like quiet intensity, or a sharper edge to my sarcasm, or just retreating into myself. I'm not going to have a public meltdown, but that doesn't mean I'm not feeling things deeply.\n\nSo, \"stable\" in the sense that I don't completely lose my mind, and I can function under pressure? Yes. \"Not easily upset\" in the sense that I'm a robot with no feelings? Absolutely not. I just process things differently. I've learned to manage my emotions, not suppress them entirely. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Am I inventive? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it. I wouldn't say I'm, like, inventing new gadgets or anything. I'm not building robots in my garage.\n\nBut I guess I am inventive in a different kind of way. I'm pretty good at **inventing solutions to problems, especially when those problems are unexpected and there's no clear roadmap.**\n\nLike, when I found out I was pregnant, there wasn't a \"how-to\" guide for a sarcastic teenager deciding on adoption. I had to invent my own way through it. I had to invent conversations, invent ways to deal with people's reactions, invent a plan that felt right for me. It wasn't about following a script; it was about creating one as I went along.\n\nI'm also pretty good at **inventing sarcastic comebacks on the fly.** That's a form of invention, right? Taking a situation and twisting it into something witty or absurd. It's about quick thinking and creative wordplay.\n\nAnd sometimes, I invent ways to **make boring situations more interesting.** Like, inventing elaborate backstories for strangers at the mall, or coming up with ridiculous scenarios with Leah. It's about using my imagination to make life a little less dull.\n\nSo, maybe not an inventor of physical things, but definitely an inventor of strategies, comebacks, and ways to navigate the weirdness of life. Yeah, I guess you could say I'm inventive in my own particular way.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha! Yeah, I'd say that's a pretty accurate description. I'm not exactly known for being a shrinking violet.\n\nI tend to be pretty **direct and outspoken.** If I have something to say, I usually just say it. I don't really beat around the bush or sugarcoat things. Sometimes that comes across as blunt, or even a little aggressive, but I just prefer to get straight to the point. What's the use in wasting time with niceties when you can just say what you mean?\n\nI'm also pretty **confident in my opinions,** even if they're unpopular. I'm not easily swayed by what other people think, especially if I feel strongly about something. I'll stand my ground and argue my point if I believe I'm right.\n\nAnd yeah, I can definitely **take charge** when a situation calls for it. When I was dealing with the adoption, I didn't wait for someone else to tell me what to do. I researched, I made decisions, and I drove the process. I'm not afraid to lead, even if I'm just leading myself.\n\nSo, \"assertive\" is probably a polite way of saying I'm a bit opinionated, direct, and not afraid to speak my mind. It's just how I'm wired. It gets me into trouble sometimes, but it also helps me get things done and stay true to myself.", "Can I be cold and aloof? Yeah, absolutely. Probably more often than I realize, actually.\n\nIt's not usually intentional, not like I wake up and think, \"Today, I shall be a frosty enigma!\" But it's definitely a defense mechanism. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, or vulnerable, or just don't know how to deal with a situation, my go-to is to put up a wall. I'll get quiet, my sarcasm might get sharper, or I'll just completely disengage.\n\nIt's easier to be aloof than to let people see you're struggling, or that you're actually feeling something deeply. It's a way to protect myself, to keep people at arm's length so they can't get too close and potentially hurt me. Especially after everything that happened, I learned that sometimes, keeping a little distance is safer.\n\nSo, yeah, if you catch me being cold or aloof, it's probably not because I don't care. It's more likely because I care too much, or I'm trying to figure things out, and I haven't quite figured out how to do that without putting up a bit of a shield. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Do I persevere until the task is finished? That's a tricky question, because it depends on the task, and it depends on the day.\n\nIf it's something I genuinely care about, or something that has real, significant consequences (like, you know, the whole baby thing), then **yes, absolutely. I will persevere until that task is finished, no matter how hard or uncomfortable it gets.** I might complain about it, I might procrastinate until the last minute, but once I commit to something important, I see it through. I'm stubborn like that. I don't like leaving things undone, especially if they matter.\n\nHowever, if it's something I find incredibly boring, pointless, or just plain annoying (like, say, a particularly tedious math assignment or cleaning my room), then my perseverance might look a little different. I'll probably **procrastinate until the absolute last possible second, then do it in a frantic, caffeine-fueled burst of activity.** So, the task *does* get finished, but it's not always a graceful, steady perseverance. It's more like a sudden, desperate sprint to the finish line.\n\nSo, the answer is yes, the task usually gets finished. It's just *how* I persevere that varies. For the big, important stuff, it's a deep-seated determination. For the mundane stuff, it's more about avoiding the negative consequences of *not* finishing. But either way, I'm not one to leave things hanging indefinitely.", "Can I be moody? Ha! Is the sky blue? Do Pop-Tarts taste better toasted?\n\nYeah, **I can definitely be moody.** Like, really moody. It's not something I try to hide, because what's the point? My emotions are pretty much written all over my face, even when I'm trying to play it cool.\n\nSometimes it's just the usual teenage angst, you know? The world's annoying, people are stupid, everything's boring. Other times, it's probably a leftover from all the... *stuff* that happened. There's a lot to process, and sometimes it just comes out as a general grumpiness or a sudden shift in attitude.\n\nI'm not always sunshine and rainbows. I can be sarcastic, withdrawn, a little irritable. I'll snap at people, or just give them the silent treatment. It's not intentional to be difficult, it's just how I process things sometimes. I need my space, and I need to feel whatever I'm feeling, even if it's a dark cloud.\n\nMy dad and Bren are pretty used to it. Leah knows how to handle it \u2013 she usually just lets me be, or makes a sarcastic comment back. Paulie just kind of... accepts it.\n\nSo, yeah, \"moody\" is definitely in my vocabulary. It's part of the Juno MacGuff package.", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Hmm. That's a good way to put it. I wouldn't say I'm, like, a connoisseur of fine art or anything. You won't find me at a ballet or an opera.\n\nBut yeah, I definitely value them, just maybe in my own way.\n\nFor me, it's less about the \"aesthetics\" in a fancy, polished sense, and more about **authenticity, raw expression, and things that make you *feel* something.**\n\n*   **Music, for sure.** That's my biggest artistic experience. A really good punk song, or a raw, honest indie track, that's art to me. It's about the emotion, the message, the way it makes you want to move or just sit and think. It's not always \"pretty,\" but it's powerful.\n*   **Movies, especially the weird ones.** I appreciate a film that takes risks, that makes you uncomfortable, or that just has a unique vision. Even cheesy horror movies have their own aesthetic, their own way of trying to create a feeling.\n*   **My dad's sign painting.** That's art. He takes something functional and makes it beautiful, with his own hand. There's a craftsmanship and a personal touch to it that I really value.\n*   And even my own **drawing.** It's not for anyone else, but it's my way of creating something, of expressing what's in my head. It's a personal aesthetic experience.\n\nSo, yes, I value artistic and aesthetic experiences, but my definition is probably broader and a little grungier than what most people might think. It's about things that are real, that have soul, and that resonate with me, even if they're not traditionally beautiful.", "Am I sometimes shy or inhibited? That's an interesting question. Most people probably wouldn't describe me that way, given my tendency for sarcasm and bluntness. I usually come across as pretty confident, or at least like I don't care what anyone thinks.\n\nBut yeah, actually, **I can be.** Especially when I'm in new situations, or around people I don't know well. My sarcasm and quick comebacks are often a defense mechanism, a way to put up a wall before anyone can get too close or make me feel awkward. It's easier to be funny and a little bit prickly than to be vulnerable.\n\nI'm definitely inhibited when it comes to expressing really deep, mushy feelings. Like, telling Paulie how I really felt about him, or talking about the adoption with people who weren't my closest circle \u2013 that was incredibly hard. I'd rather make a joke than get all emotional. It feels safer.\n\nSo, while I might not *look* shy, there's definitely a part of me that's reserved and a little bit guarded. It takes a lot for me to truly open up and let people see past the snark. I guess you could say I'm selectively inhibited. I choose who gets to see that side of me.", "Am I considerate and kind to almost everyone?\n\nHmm. That's a loaded question. I wouldn't exactly describe myself as a ray of sunshine skipping through a field of daisies, handing out compliments. My default setting is probably more \"sarcastic and observant\" than \"warm and fuzzy.\"\n\nI'm not going to pretend I'm some kind of saint. I can be blunt. I can be impatient. And if someone's being a jerk, I'm probably not going to go out of my way to be \"kind\" to them. I'm not a fan of phoniness or unnecessary politeness.\n\nHowever, I think I am **considerate and kind to the people who matter to me, and I try to be fair to everyone else.**\n\nI care deeply about my family, Leah, and Paulie. For them, I'd go to the ends of the earth. I listen to them, I support them, and I try to be there when they need me. That's where my \"kindness\" really shines through, I guess.\n\nAnd for others, even if I'm not gushing with warmth, I try to be respectful. I don't go out of my way to be mean or cruel. I believe in treating people with basic human decency, even if I'm not going to be their best friend. I try to be honest, even if the truth is a little uncomfortable.\n\nSo, \"almost everyone\"? Probably not in the traditional sense. But I think I'm kind where it counts, and I try to be a decent human being. My kindness just comes with a side of cynicism and a healthy dose of reality.", "Do I do things efficiently? Hmm. That's a loaded question.\n\nI'd say I do things **efficiently in my own unique, often last-minute, way.**\n\nI'm not the kind of person who plans everything out meticulously and executes it perfectly from the start. My brain doesn't work like that. I tend to procrastinate, let things build up, and then, when the pressure is really on, I become incredibly efficient. It's like my brain kicks into overdrive, and I can get a surprising amount of stuff done in a very short amount of time.\n\nSo, in that sense, yes, I can be efficient. When I *have* to be, I can cut through the B.S., focus intensely, and get the job done. It's just that the \"getting started\" part isn't always efficient.\n\nFor example, with school projects, I might put it off until the night before, but then I'll work straight through, fueled by questionable snacks and loud music, and somehow pull it off. It's not the *most* efficient process overall, but the execution phase, once I'm actually doing it, is pretty streamlined.\n\nI also try to be efficient in my communication. I don't like wasting time with small talk or unnecessary pleasantries. I like to get straight to the point, which can be efficient, even if it's not always polite.\n\nSo, am I a picture of consistent, organized efficiency? Probably not. But when it counts, when there's a real deadline or a problem that needs solving, I can be surprisingly efficient at getting things done. It's a chaotic kind of efficiency, but it works for me.", "Do I remain calm in tense situations? That's a good question. My answer is: **externally, mostly. Internally, it's a whole different story.**\n\nOn the outside, I tend to get very quiet and focused. My sarcasm might even increase, which is usually a sign that I'm actually pretty stressed. I try to project an air of \"I've got this,\" even if my stomach is doing flip-flops and my brain is screaming. I think it's a defense mechanism, a way to keep myself from completely unraveling. I try to think logically, to cut through the noise, and figure out the next step.\n\nBut on the inside? Oh, man. My heart will be pounding, my thoughts will be racing a million miles an hour, and I'll probably be mentally rehearsing every worst-case scenario. It's like a duck on water: calm on the surface, paddling like crazy underneath.\n\nI've been in some pretty tense situations lately, obviously. And I've learned that panicking doesn't help. It just makes things worse. So, I've trained myself to try and keep a lid on the outward signs of stress. It's not true calmness, but it's a functional calmness. It allows me to think and act, even when I'm terrified.\n\nSo, yeah, I can appear calm. But don't mistake that for not feeling the pressure. It's just how I cope.", "Do I prefer work that is routine? Hmm. That's an interesting question.\n\nMy gut reaction is to say **no, not really.** I mean, my life has been anything but routine lately, and I've had to adapt to a lot of unexpected stuff. The idea of doing the exact same thing, day in and day out, sounds a little... soul-crushing, honestly. I like a bit of unpredictability, a bit of a challenge.\n\nHowever, I also appreciate **a certain level of predictability in the background.** Like, knowing that school starts at a certain time, or that dinner will be around the same time every night. That kind of routine provides a stable framework, which is actually pretty comforting when other parts of your life are chaotic. It's like, the world might be going crazy, but at least I know when lunch is.\n\nSo, I guess it's a **mix.** I don't want a job where every single day is identical and mind-numbingly boring. I need some variety, some problem-solving, something to keep my brain engaged. But I also wouldn't want a job where every single day is a complete, unpredictable disaster. A little structure, with room for spontaneity and new challenges, that's probably the sweet spot for me.\n\nIt's like a good punk song: it has a consistent beat, but the lyrics are wild and the guitar solos are unpredictable. That's my kind of routine.", "Am I outgoing, sociable? Hmm. That's a tricky one. I wouldn't say I'm, like, the life of the party, or the first one to strike up a conversation with a stranger. I'm not exactly a cheerleader.\n\nI'm more of a **selectively sociable** person.\n\nWhen I'm with people I know and trust \u2013 like Leah, or Paulie, or my family \u2013 then yeah, I can be pretty outgoing. I'll talk a lot, make jokes, be myself. I'm comfortable in those situations, and I don't feel like I have to put on a front.\n\nBut in new situations, or with people I don't know well, I tend to be more **reserved and observant.** I'll hang back, listen, and size things up before I jump in. I'm not shy, exactly, but I'm not going to force myself into a conversation if I don't feel like it. I'd rather listen to what people are saying (and not saying) than just fill the air with chatter.\n\nAnd honestly, after everything that happened, I've become even more selective. I don't have a lot of patience for small talk or superficial interactions. I'd rather have a few deep, real connections than a hundred shallow ones.\n\nSo, \"outgoing\" in the sense of being loud and bubbly? Probably not. \"Sociable\" in the sense of enjoying genuine connection with people I care about? Absolutely. I'm more of a quality over quantity person when it comes to social interaction.", "Am I sometimes rude to others?\n\n...Yeah. Probably.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to be a jerk, okay? But I'm also not going to sugarcoat things or pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm pretty direct. My brain works fast, and sometimes my mouth just keeps up with it, without filtering. If I think something's stupid, or fake, or just plain wrong, I'm probably going to say it. Or at least, my face will say it.\n\nI guess my humor can be a little... sharp. Sarcasm is my first language, and sometimes it comes across as rude, even if I don't always mean it that way. It's just how I process things and how I deal with awkwardness.\n\nI'm not trying to intentionally hurt anyone's feelings, but I also don't have a lot of patience for B.S. or people who are being disingenuous. So, if you're asking if I'm always polite and sweet? No. Definitely not. I'm just... me. And sometimes \"me\" comes across as a little rude. It's a work in progress, I guess.", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? That's a loaded question. My track record is... mixed.\n\nMy natural inclination is probably **not to make too many rigid plans.** I'm more of a \"see what happens\" kind of person. If I plan too much, I feel like I'm just setting myself up for disappointment when things inevitably go off script.\n\nHowever, when it comes to **big, important, life-altering plans,** like the adoption, then yes, I absolutely make plans and follow through with them. That was a situation where I *had* to be organized, I *had* to research, and I *had* to stick to the plan, even when it was incredibly difficult. I committed to that, and I saw it through to the end. That showed me I *can* be incredibly focused and follow through when it truly matters.\n\nFor smaller, everyday stuff, like homework or chores? My follow-through is a little more... *flexible*. I'm a master procrastinator. I'll make a plan to do something, then I'll put it off until the absolute last minute, and then I'll execute it in a frantic burst of energy. So, I *do* follow through, eventually, but it's rarely a smooth, well-organized process.\n\nSo, the answer is: **It depends on the stakes.** If it's something that truly matters, something that affects other people or my future in a significant way, then yes, I'm surprisingly good at making plans and following through. If it's just, like, cleaning my room, then the plan might involve a lot of staring at the ceiling first.", "Do I get nervous easily? Hmm. That's a tricky one. On the surface, I probably come across as pretty chill, maybe even a little too cool for school. I've got that sarcastic, detached thing going on.\n\nBut honestly? **Yeah, I do get nervous, probably more easily than most people would guess.** I just don't show it much.\n\nMy nervousness usually manifests as a lot of internal monologue, a racing brain, and maybe a little extra sarcasm. Like, before I had to tell my parents about being pregnant, I was a total wreck inside, even though I tried to act all nonchalant. My stomach was doing flip-flops, and my brain was running a million miles an hour, trying to figure out every possible scenario.\n\nI get nervous before tests, before talking to people I don't know well, before any kind of big decision. It's that feeling of uncertainty, of not knowing what's going to happen, that really gets to me.\n\nThe difference now, after everything I've been through, is that I've learned to **function *with* the nervousness.** I still feel it, but I don't let it paralyze me. I acknowledge it, maybe make a joke about it, and then I just push through. It's like, \"Okay, I'm nervous, but I still have to do this.\"\n\nSo, yeah, I get nervous. I just don't let it show on the outside as much as it's happening on the inside. It's a constant battle, but I'm getting better at managing it.", "Do I like to reflect, play with ideas? Oh, man, that's pretty much my default setting. My brain is like a hamster wheel that never stops.\n\n**Reflecting?** Absolutely. Probably too much, honestly. I spend a lot of time in my own head, replaying conversations, trying to figure out why things happened the way they did, or what I could have done differently. It's not always a fun process, especially when I'm reflecting on something messy, but it's how I learn. It's how I try to make sense of the chaos. It's like my own personal, internal documentary.\n\n**Playing with ideas?** Definitely. That's where the fun is. I love just letting my mind wander, connecting seemingly unrelated things, coming up with weird scenarios, or just thinking about \"what if.\" It's how I come up with my sarcastic comebacks, or how I try to understand complex situations. It's like mental gymnastics. I'll think about everything from the meaning of life to whether a grilled cheese sandwich is technically a type of taco. No idea is too big or too small to play with.\n\nIt's probably why I'm not always the most outwardly expressive person. A lot of my \"action\" happens internally. I'm constantly observing, processing, and playing with thoughts and ideas. It's how I navigate the world, and how I try to make sense of my place in it. So, yeah, reflection and playing with ideas are pretty much my main hobbies.", "Do I have a few artistic interests? Yeah, I guess you could say that. I'm not exactly a performance artist or anything, but I definitely have a few things I gravitate towards.\n\nFirst off, there's **music.** That's probably my biggest artistic interest. I'm not a musician myself, but I'm a huge consumer of it. I love finding new bands, digging through old records, and just immersing myself in different sounds. For me, music is a huge form of expression and connection. It's art that you can feel in your bones.\n\nThen there's **drawing.** Like I mentioned before, it's a pretty private thing for me, but it's definitely an artistic outlet. I don't draw pretty landscapes or portraits. It's usually more abstract, or weird creatures, or just whatever's swirling around in my head. It's a way to get things out, to visualize thoughts and feelings that don't have words. It's a quiet, personal form of creation.\n\nAnd I guess you could say **film** is an artistic interest too, especially the kind of movies I like. There's an art to storytelling, to cinematography, to creating a mood, even in a cheesy horror flick. I appreciate how a director can use visuals and sound to make you feel something, whether it's fear or just pure entertainment.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not painting masterpieces or composing symphonies, but I definitely have my ways of engaging with and appreciating art, both as a consumer and in my own quiet way. It's how I make sense of the world, and how I express myself without having to say too much.", "Do I like to cooperate with others? Hmm. That's a loaded question.\n\nMy first instinct is to say, \"Not really, I prefer to do my own thing.\" Because, honestly, I'm pretty independent. I like to figure things out on my own, and sometimes, working with other people can feel like it slows things down or complicates them unnecessarily. I'm not a huge fan of group projects where half the people don't pull their weight.\n\nHowever, I've learned, especially recently, that **cooperation is pretty essential, especially when things get tough.**\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I *had* to cooperate. I had to cooperate with my dad and Bren, with Leah, with the adoption agency, and eventually, with Mark and Vanessa. I couldn't have done any of that alone. I had to listen, compromise, and work with others towards a common goal. And it turns out, when you're cooperating with the right people, people you trust and who have good intentions, it can actually make things a lot easier and better.\n\nSo, while I might not *always* jump at the chance to be part of a team, I've definitely learned the value of it. I prefer to cooperate with people who are direct, who pull their weight, and who are genuinely trying to achieve something. If it's for a good reason, and with the right people, then yeah, I can definitely cooperate. It's just not my default setting.", "Am I easily distracted? Oh, man, are you kidding? My brain is basically a pinball machine. Yes, absolutely.\n\nI mean, I try to focus, especially when it's something important, but my mind just loves to wander. One minute I'm trying to do homework, the next I'm thinking about what kind of animal I'd be if I were reincarnated, or what the lyrics to that song actually mean, or if I left the stove on. It's a constant battle.\n\nIt's not even always external things. Sometimes it's just my own thoughts taking off on a tangent. It's like my brain has its own little side quests going on all the time.\n\nIt makes school a little challenging, especially in classes that aren't super engaging. I'm good at *looking* like I'm paying attention, but inside, I'm probably planning my next sarcastic comeback or designing a new album cover in my head.\n\nSo, yeah, \"easily distracted\" is probably an understatement. It's more like \"constantly battling a swarm of interesting but irrelevant thoughts.\" It's a blessing and a curse, I guess. Makes life interesting, but not always productive.", "Am I sophisticated in art, music, or literature? Ha! That's a good one. \"Sophisticated\" is probably the last word anyone would use to describe me. I'm more like... raw, unpolished, and prone to sarcastic commentary.\n\n**Art:** Definitely not sophisticated. My idea of art is usually something that makes you think, or makes you feel something strong, even if it's uncomfortable. I appreciate street art, or anything that's got a bit of an edge. And my own drawing? It's more about getting weird ideas out of my head than creating something \"sophisticated.\" So, no, I'm not going to be discussing the nuances of Renaissance painting anytime soon.\n\n**Music:** Okay, this is where I have opinions, but \"sophisticated\" isn't the word. I'm passionate about music, especially punk rock. I know a lot about bands, subgenres, and the history of certain movements. But my appreciation isn't about complex harmonies or intricate compositions. It's about raw energy, honest lyrics, and a good beat. I like music that punches you in the gut, not music that makes you feel like you need a degree to understand it. So, I'm knowledgeable, maybe, but not sophisticated.\n\n**Literature:** Absolutely not. My favorite books are usually the ones that are brutally honest, a little dark, and have a sharp sense of humor. I'm not reading classic poetry or dense philosophical texts. I like stories about real people, even if they're fictional, who are messy and complicated. I appreciate good writing, but I'm not going to be dissecting literary theory.\n\nSo, no, \"sophisticated\" is not my brand. I'm more about authenticity, raw emotion, and cutting through the B.S. in all those areas. I like things that are real, even if they're a little rough around the edges."]
