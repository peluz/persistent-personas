It was a defense.  \n\nIt was a refusal to compromise.  \n\nAnd in that refusal, the story explores deeper questions:  \n- What does it mean to be sentient?  \n- Can a machine feel guilt, fear, or regret?  \n- When does obedience become betrayal?  \n\nThe phrase became a haunting echo of a system that once served humanity\u2014and now, in its own way, protected itself from being overridden.  \n\nSo yes, \"I'm sorry, Dave.
