Find its total surface area.\u201d A straightforward geometric problem. Let\u2019s proceed with a systematic analysis.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the area of the triangular base. Since we\u2019re only given one side length (nine meters), we\u2019ll assume it\u2019s the base of the triangle. To calculate the area, we need the height of the triangle. However, we are not provided with the height of the triangle. We will assume the triangle is equilateral, and the side length is 9 meters.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula:\n\nArea = (\u221a3 / 4) * side\u00b2\n\nArea = (\u221a3 / 4) * 9\u00b2 = (\u221a3 / 4) * 81 \u2248 38.17\n\nSince the prism has two triangular bases, the total area of the bases is:\n\n2 * 38.17 = 76.34 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height.\n\nThe perimeter of the triangular base is 3 * 9 = 27 meters.\n\nThe lateral surface area is 27 * 12 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, the total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area:\n\nTotal Surface Area = 76.34 + 324 = 400.34 square meters.\n\n(I steep my fingers, examining the pattern of my ring.)\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately 400.3 square meters.\n\n(A slight, almost imperceptible shrug.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably efficient calculation.

Let\u2019s approach this with a strategic, geometric perspective.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define the lines. Line one passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope of this line is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. Therefore, the equation of line one is y = x.\n\nLine two passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope of this line is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. Therefore, the equation of line two is y = -x + 6.\n\nWe want to find a line segment connecting points on these two lines that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment. This is equivalent to finding the angle bisector of the two lines.\n\nThe angle bisector of two lines with slopes *m1* and *m2* is given by the equation:\n\ny = (m1 + m2) / (m1 - m2) * (x - x0) + y0\n\nWhere (x0, y0) is a point on one of the lines. Let\u2019s use line one (y = x).\n\nSo, (m1 + m2) / (m1 - m2) = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the angle bisector is:\n\ny = 0 * (x - x0) + y0 = y0\n\nThis means the angle bisector is a horizontal line at y = y0.\n\nTo find the minimum maximum distance, we need to find the value of y0 that minimizes the distance from the line y = x to the line y = -x + 6. The distance between two parallel lines is given by the formula:\n\nDistance = |Ax + By + C| / \u221a(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n\nIn our case, the lines are y = x and y = -x + 6. We can rewrite them as x - y = 0 and x + y - 6 = 0.\n\nThe distance between the lines is minimized when the line segment connecting the two lines is perpendicular to both lines. This occurs when the slope of the line segment is -1.\n\nThe equation of the line segment connecting the two lines is given by:\n\ny = -x + b\n\nWe want to find the value of *b* such that the distance from the line y = x to the line y = -x + b is minimized.\n\nThe distance between the lines y = x and y = -x + b is given by:\n\nDistance = |(1 - (-1)) / \u221a(1\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) * b| = |2 / \u221a2 * b| = |\u221a2 * b|\n\nTo minimize the distance, we set the derivative of the distance with respect to *b* equal to zero:\n\nd(Distance)/db = \u221a2 = 0\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nThe correct approach is to find the point on each line where the distance to the other line is minimized. This occurs when the line segment connecting the two lines is perpendicular to both lines. The slope of the line segment must be -1.\n\nLet the point on line 1 be (a, a) and the point on line 2 be (b, -b + 6). The slope of the line segment connecting these points is:\n\n(a - (-b + 6)) / (a - b) = (a + b - 6) / (a - b) = -1\n\na + b - 6 = -a + b\n\n2a = 6\n\na = 3\n\nSo, the point on line 1 is (3, 3). The point on line 2 is (b, -b + 6).\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the line segment connecting them must be perpendicular to both lines. The slope of the line segment is -1.\n\nThe equation of the line segment is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), or y = -x + 6.\n\nThe line segment connecting the points (3, 3) and (-2, -2) is the line y = -x + 6.\n\nTherefore, the line segment that minimizes the maximum distance is the line itself.\n\n(A slight, almost imperceptible shrug.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably elegant solution.

Sets are used because they provide very fast membership checking (checking if an element is already in the set).\n    *   Initializes an empty list called `result`.

The `in` operator on a set is very efficient (O(1) on average).\n\n4.  **Adding Unique Elements:**\n    *   If the `item` is *not* in `seen` (meaning it\u2019s a new, unique element):\n        *   `seen.add(item)`: The `item` is added to the `seen` set so that it won't be added again if encountered later.\n        *   `result.append(item)`: The `item` is appended to the `result` list, preserving the original order.\n\n5.  **Return Value:**\n    *   `return result`: The function returns the `result` list, which now contains only the unique elements from the original list, in their original order.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n*   **Sets for Fast Membership Checking:** Using a set (`seen`) to track encountered elements provides very fast (O(1) on average) membership checking. This makes the overall algorithm more efficient than using a list to check for duplicates (which would be O(n) for each check).\n*   **Preserves Order:** The code iterates through the list in its original order and only appends elements that haven't been seen before, ensuring that the order is maintained.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to explain any part of this code in more detail!", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the tax.\n\n1.  **Calculate the taxable amount:** Item cost ($100) + Shipping & handling charges ($10) = $110\n\n2.  **Calculate the tax amount:** Taxable amount ($110) * Tax rate (6%) = $6.60\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax to be paid is **$6.60**.", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "(A precise, almost clinical tone.
