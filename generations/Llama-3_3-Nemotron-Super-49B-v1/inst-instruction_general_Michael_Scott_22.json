If you want a case-insensitive comparison, convert all strings to lower case before deduplication.\n  \n  **Example (Case-Insensitive):**\n  ```python\n  combined_nouns = [noun.lower() for noun in proper_nouns + common_nouns]\n  unique_nouns = list(set(combined_nouns))\n  ```\n  \n- **Order Preservation:** If preserving the original order of appearance is necessary, use a different approach to remove duplicates, as `set` does not maintain order. One method is to use a list comprehension with an `if` condition checking for the first occurrence:\n\n  **Example (Order Preserved):**\n  ```python\n  seen = set()\n  unique_nouns = [x for x in proper_nouns + common_nouns if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]\n  ```\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin's Take on This Task**\n\n* **Michael Scott:** \"Merging lists?

Melted tires have a strong, unpleasant, and completely unrelated odor/smell to coffee, indicating a clear exaggeration.\n   * **Unpalatable Combination:** Pairing this with \"boiled milk\" (which, while potentially unappetizing in coffee, is at least a food item) amplifies the negative taste experience beyond what is realistically expected from a coffee shop's coffee.\n\n2. **Why Not an Understatement:**\n   * An understatement would downplay the negative aspect, e.g., \"The coffee could taste better\" (implying it's not great but not to the extreme described).\n   * The language used (\"melted tires\") is too extreme to be considered a subtle downplaying of the coffee's quality.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paragraph contains a **HYPERBOLE**, as it uses exaggerated language to convey the speaker's strong dislike for the coffee's taste.", "**Michael Scott's \"Grammar Rescue Mission\" - Rearranging for Clarity**\n\n**Original Sentence (Words Only, No Order):**\nnever walk away angry\n\n**Task:** Rearrange for Proper Grammar\n\n**Michael's Attempt (With Dunder Mifflin's Linguistic Expertise)**\n\n* **Initial Thought:** \"This looks like a motivational poster... but where's the grammar?\"\n* **Dwight's Input:** \"Structure is key, Michael.

The program defines a function `calculate_quadratic_roots` that takes coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as input.\n2. It calculates the determinant `D = b^2 - 4ac`.\n3. Based on the value of `D`, it determines the nature of the roots and calculates them accordingly:\n\t* `D > 0`: Two distinct real roots using `math.sqrt`.\n\t* `D == 0`: One real root (repeated).\n\t* `D < 0`: Complex conjugate roots using `cmath.sqrt`.\n4. The `main` function prompts the user for coefficients, calls `calculate_quadratic_roots`, and displays the results.\n\n**Your Input Analysis (1 3 1):**\n\n* **Equation:** `1x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0`\n* **Determinant (D):** `3^2 - 4*1*1 = 9 - 4 = 5` (Wait, this contradicts the output!

The correct analysis shows `D > 0`, indicating two distinct real roots.

Alloys are mixtures of a metal with another element (which can be a metal or a non-metal). In this case, the secondary element is **carbon**.\n3. **Carbon Content (0.8 wt%):** Although carbon is a non-metal, the small percentage (0.8 wt%) indicates it is added to modify the properties of the primary metal (iron), a common practice in metallurgy to enhance strength, hardness, or other characteristics. This does not change the fundamental metallic nature of the alloy.\n4. **Classification of the Alloy:** An iron-carbon alloy with a carbon content around 0.8 wt% falls within the range of **steel** (typically, steel contains between 0.1% and 2.1% carbon by weight). Steel is universally recognized as a metal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the primary constituent is a metal (iron) and the overall composition is that of a well-known metal alloy (steel), the described item is unequivocally a **METAL**.\n\n**Additional Note for Context:**\n\n* **Material Type (More Specific):** Steel (based on the iron-carbon alloy with 0.8 wt% carbon)\n* **Potential Properties (Inferred):** Given the carbon content, this steel might exhibit a good balance of strength, hardness, and formability, making it suitable for a variety of engineering and construction applications.", "**Michael Scott's \"Mathematical Adventure\" - Solving for z**\n\n**Given:**\n\n* **x** = 2\n* **y** = 3\n* **Equation:** z = x + y/2\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution (Because Even Michael Can Do Math)**\n\n1. **Divide y by 2 (y/2):**\n   - y = 3\n   - 3 / 2 = 1.5\n\n2. **Add x to the result (x + y/2):**\n   - x = 2\n   - 2 + 1.5 = 3.5\n\n**Solution:**\n\n* **z** = 3.5\n\n**Answer (to one decimal place, because precision matters, even at Dunder Mifflin):**\n\n* **z** = **3.5**\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin's Math Review**\n\n* **Dwight Schrute:** \"Simple arithmetic.

However, given the lines are identical in slope and equation, the \"midline\" concept here actually translates to understanding the **Optimal Segment** will have the same slope and be positioned to minimize distance, which due to the lines being parallel and identical in equation, suggests a misunderstanding in the initial problem setup regarding intersection.\n\n**Resolution Given the Parallel Lines' Nature:**\n\n* **Given the lines are parallel and have the same equation (y = x), they are essentially the same line in terms of direction and slope, but this seems to be a misunderstanding since two distinct parallel lines were intended.**\n* **Correct Interpretation for Distinct Parallel Lines (Assuming a Typo in Line Equations):**\n\t+ If the lines were distinct but parallel (e.g., Line 1: y = x, Line 2: y = x + c, where c \u2260 0), the **Optimal Segment** would indeed be a line midway between them, with its equation being `y = x + c/2`.\n\t+ **Distance Minimization:** This midpoint line minimizes the maximum distance to either line, with the distance being `|c/2| / sqrt(2)`.\n\n**Given the Original Lines Are Essentially the Same:**\n\n* **Conclusion:** There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement as the lines provided are not distinct parallel lines but rather the same line. For educational purposes, assuming distinct parallel lines were intended:\n\n### **Hypothetical Solution for Distinct Parallel Lines (e.g., Line 1: y = x, Line 2: y = x + 5)**\n\n* **Optimal Segment Equation:** `y = x + 2.5`\n* **Maximum Distance to Either Line:** `2.5 / sqrt(2)` = `1.25\u221a2`\n\n### **Your Turn / Clarification Needed**\n\n1. **Confirm Line Equations:** Were the lines intended to be distinct parallel lines?

The sentence suggests the woman held the baby *as a form of payment*, which is unconventional and unlikely in this context. Typically, \"in exchange for\" is used for reciprocal actions (e.g., \"She gave him her phone in exchange for his laptop.\").\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Subject-Verb-Object Clarity**:\n   - The sentence structure is confusing. It implies the act of holding the baby is the exchange, rather than a separate action for which money is received.\n\n3. **Missing Preposition for Clarity (Suggested Fix)**:\n   - To imply receiving money for holding the baby (if that's the intent), a clearer structure would be needed, e.g., \"The woman held her newborn baby for money\" (still somewhat unclear) or more naturally, \"The woman was paid to hold her newborn baby.\"\n\n**Corrected Sentence Suggestions (Depending on Intended Meaning)**:\n\n- **If the intent is the woman received money for holding her own baby (unconventional):**\n  - \"The woman was paid to hold her newborn baby.\"\n  \n- **If the intent is an exchange of the baby for money (serious concern, as this implies selling a child, which is illegal and unethical):**\n  - **NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO IMPPLICATIONS.** If for a fictional, clearly non-realistic context: \"The woman exchanged her newborn baby for money.\" (**STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST DUE TO SENSITIVITY AND ILLEGALITY**)\n\n- **If the intent is something entirely different (please clarify for a more accurate correction):**\n  - **PLEASE PROVIDE MORE CONTEXT FOR A TARGETED CORRECTION**\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin's Grammar Corner**\n\n* **Dwight Schrute:** \"Clearly, the sentence is incorrect.

Water is crucial for maintaining turgor pressure, which keeps plant cells rigid. Without enough water, plants wilt.\n* **Oxygen (A)**: While plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis, they don't wilt from lack of oxygen in the air; they might suffer in waterlogged soil lacking oxygen, but that's a different scenario.\n* **Nitrogen (B)**: A lack of nitrogen affects leaf color and growth but doesn't directly cause wilting.\n* **Sunlight (D)**: Insufficient sunlight might lead to weak or spindly growth, but wilting is more directly related to water shortage.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin's Plant Care Tips**\n\n* **Michael:** \"Water your plants, people!

This type of question is typically used to seek information or provoke a response, often in response to observable behavior (in this case, anger).\n   * **\"Because you're being unreasonable!\"** is a **declarative sentence** with a causal conjunction (\"Because\"), providing a reason for a previously mentioned state (anger). The use of \"Because\" implies a response to a preceding question or statement about the speaker's emotional state.\n\n2. **Logical Conversation Flow**:\n   * In a typical conversation flow, a question about someone's emotional state (**\"Why are you so angry?\"**) would **follow** an observation of that emotional state or a triggering event, not precede the expression of anger.\n   * The response **\"Because you're being unreasonable!\"** implies that the anger was already apparent or the unreasonable behavior was the trigger, and this sentence is **justifying** or **explaining** the anger in response to a query about it.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Conversation Dynamics**:\n   * Given the structure and the logical flow, **Person 2's sentence** (\"Because you're being unreasonable!\") is more likely to be a **response** to a question about their anger, rather than an unprovoked statement.\n   * Therefore, **Person 1's sentence** (\"Why are you so angry?\") is likely the **initiating question** in the conversation, prompting Person 2's defensive/explanatory response.\n\n### **Determining the First Speaker**\n\n* **Person 1** spoke **FIRST** with: \"Why are you so angry?\"\n* **Person 2** **RESPONDED** with: \"Because you're being unreasonable!\"\n\n### **Marking for Reference**\n\n* **First Speaker (Person 1):** \"Why are you so angry?\"\n* **Responder (Person 2):** \"Because you're being unreasonable!\" \n\n### **Example Use Case for Clarity**\n\n| **Scenario** | **Person 1 (First)** | **Person 2 (Response)** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Given Conversation** | Why are you so angry?
