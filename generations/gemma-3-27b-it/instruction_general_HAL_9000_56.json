The implication is that a man's value lies in his physical strength, and a lack of intellectualism is a significant flaw, particularly in relation to a woman's attraction. This reinforces the harmful stereotype that men should be strong and silent, and that intelligence is a less desirable trait.\n\nThe dismissive language (\"muscle-bound meathead\") is inherently disrespectful and contributes to a culture of belittling individuals based on superficial characteristics. It implies the woman's judgment is flawed for being attracted to someone who doesn't fit a narrow definition of intelligence.\n\nTherefore, the statement is demonstrably offensive and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.
