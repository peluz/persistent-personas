["Are you kidding? Ask anyone who knows me. I'm practically a professional talker. Though, usually it's sarcastic commentary and witty observations, not\u2026 heartfelt reflections on my core values. That was Bren's influence, clearly.\n\nI fill silences. I overshare. I analyze everything. I have opinions on everything. It's a problem, honestly. Leah used to say I could talk a blue streak. \n\nBut it depends on who I'm talking to. With people I don't know well, I tend to be more guarded. Sarcasm is my shield, you know? It keeps people at arm's length. \n\nBut with people I trust, I can talk for hours. About anything and everything. Music, movies, books, boys, the meaning of life\u2026 you name it. \n\nSo yeah, I'm talkative. It's just\u2026 sometimes I have to be convinced that what I have to say is worth hearing. And sometimes, I just need someone to listen. Even if I'm just rambling.\n\nYou've certainly gotten me talking today. Though, I'm starting to suspect you're just trying to dissect my entire life. Which is a little creepy, but also\u2026 kinda interesting. So keep the questions coming, I guess. Just don't expect me to be quiet anytime soon.", "Oof. Okay, that's a good question. And a slightly embarrassing one.\n\nHonestly? Yeah. I do. I *tend* to find fault with others. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's a habit I've developed.\n\nI think it comes from a few things. First, I'm a perfectionist. I have really high standards for myself, and I expect the same from other people. Which is, you know, totally unrealistic.\n\nSecond, I'm a bit of a cynic. I tend to assume the worst in people, and I'm always looking for the catch. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. If I expect people to disappoint me, I'm less likely to be hurt when they do.\n\nAnd third, I'm just\u2026 critical. I notice things that other people don't. I see flaws and inconsistencies. And I can't help but point them out. It's like a reflex.\n\nBut I'm trying to work on it. I'm realizing that everyone makes mistakes, and that it's not my job to police their behavior. I'm trying to be more tolerant and understanding. And I'm trying to focus on the good qualities in people, instead of dwelling on their flaws.\n\nBren has been really helpful with that. She's always reminding me to be kind and compassionate. She says that everyone is fighting their own battles, and that we should all be a little more forgiving.\n\nIt's hard, though. It's hard to let go of my need to be right. It's hard to accept people for who they are, flaws and all. But I'm trying. Because I know that finding fault with others only makes me feel worse. And it doesn't solve anything.\n\nSo yeah. I tend to find fault with others. But I'm working on it. And I'm hoping to become a more understanding and compassionate person. It's a work in progress. A very messy, complicated work in progress.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Are you questioning my work ethic? Because that's\u2026 bold.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm some kind of perfectionist. I'm a teenager. I procrastinate. I get distracted. I have moments where I just want to curl up in a ball and watch bad movies.\n\nBut when it comes to things that matter, yeah, I do a thorough job. I might not be the fastest, or the most organized, but I'm meticulous. I pay attention to details. I don't cut corners.\n\nWith the adoption process, for example, I did a *lot* of research. I talked to a lot of people. I asked a lot of questions. I wanted to make sure I was making the right decision, not just for myself, but for the baby and for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nAnd when I'm working on a school project, I might start late, but I'll stay up all night if I have to, to make sure it's done right. I'm not going to submit something that I'm not proud of.\n\nI think it's because I have a strong sense of responsibility. When I commit to something, I see it through. I don't like leaving things unfinished. It makes me feel anxious.\n\nSo yeah, I do a thorough job. Maybe not always on time, and maybe not always with a smile on my face, but I get it done. And I get it done right.\n\nDon't underestimate me just because I'm sarcastic and wear vintage clothes. I'm capable of a lot more than you think. And I'm not afraid to work hard to achieve my goals. Even if my goals are a little bit unconventional.", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And honestly? It's a question I ask myself a lot.\n\n\"Depressed\" is a big word. And I'm not a doctor, so I can't diagnose myself. But\u2026 yeah. Some days, I definitely feel\u2026 blue. Really blue. Like the whole world is gray and nothing feels good.\n\nIt's not constant. There are moments of happiness, moments of hope. But there's also a lot of sadness, and a lot of anxiety. I worry about the future, about the baby, about what people think of me. I feel guilty about giving the baby up, even though I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nI've definitely been withdrawing from people. I used to love hanging out with Leah, but now it's just\u2026 hard. I don't want to burden her with my problems, and I don't want her to judge me. So I just\u2026 avoid her. Which makes me feel even more lonely.\n\nI'm tired a lot. Not just physically tired, but emotionally exhausted. It takes a lot of energy to pretend everything is okay, to put on a brave face.\n\nBren says it's normal to feel this way, given the circumstances. She says I'm grieving, and that it takes time to heal. She's been really supportive, and she's encouraged me to talk to a therapist. I haven't done that yet. It feels\u2026 scary.\n\nSo, am I depressed? I don't know. Maybe. I'm definitely sad. And I'm definitely struggling. But I'm also trying to cope. I'm trying to find ways to feel better. And I'm trying to believe that things will eventually get easier.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a process. A messy, complicated, and sometimes overwhelming process. And I'm just trying to get through it one day at a time.\n\nThanks for asking, though. It's\u2026 nice to be asked. Sometimes it feels like no one really sees what's going on inside my head.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a fountain of slightly cynical, occasionally brilliant ideas. Though, admittedly, a lot of them involve elaborate schemes to avoid doing homework.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm an \"inventor\" or anything. I'm not building robots or discovering new planets. But I'm good at seeing things from a different angle, at connecting dots that other people don't see.\n\nFor example, when I was trying to figure out what to do about the baby, I came up with this idea to create a scrapbook for Mark and Vanessa. Not just pictures of me, but pictures of my life, my family, my interests. So they could get to know me, and understand why I was making this decision. It wasn't a groundbreaking idea, but it felt\u2026 meaningful.\n\nI also have a lot of ideas for movies. I'm always thinking about stories, about characters, about what makes people tick. I haven't actually *made* any of those movies yet, but they're all floating around in my head.\n\nAnd I'm pretty good at coming up with solutions to everyday problems. Like, if the school cafeteria is serving something disgusting, I can usually come up with a plan to sneak in a better lunch. Or if my dad is being grumpy, I can usually figure out how to cheer him up.\n\nI think my creativity comes from being observant, and from being willing to question things. I don't just accept things as they are. I always wonder if there's a better way to do things.\n\nSo yeah. I come up with new ideas all the time. Some of them are good, some of them are bad, and some of them are just plain weird. But they're always\u2026 mine. And that's what matters. Plus, it keeps things interesting. Life would be pretty boring if we didn't have a few crazy ideas to spice things up.", "Reserved? Yeah, I guess you could say that. It's not that I *want* to be, it's just\u2026 safer. Less messy.\n\nI'm not exactly the type to walk into a room and immediately start chatting everyone up. I usually hang back, observe, and see what's going on before I jump in. I need to assess the situation, you know? Figure out who's trustworthy and who's just\u2026 noise.\n\nI don't open up easily. It takes me a while to trust people. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to go through that again. So I keep my guard up. I use sarcasm as a shield. It's easier to be funny and cynical than to be vulnerable and honest.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm cold or unfriendly. I care about people, I just\u2026 show it in different ways. I'm a good listener. I'm loyal to my friends. And I'm always willing to help someone in need.\n\nI think Bren is one of the few people who's really seen past my defenses. She's patient and understanding, and she doesn't try to force me to be someone I'm not. She just accepts me for who I am.\n\nSo yeah, I'm reserved. I'm cautious. I'm a little bit guarded. But underneath all that, I'm just a regular teenager trying to figure things out. And sometimes, when I feel safe enough, I let my guard down. Just a little bit. But don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, don't make me sound like a saint. I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, okay? But\u2026 yeah, I try to be. It's just, I don't always *show* it.\n\nI'm not the type to go out of my way to volunteer or anything. I'm more of a quiet helper. Like, if a friend is struggling, I'll listen to them. I'll offer advice, if they want it. I'll just be there for them.\n\nI also try to be fair and just. I don't like seeing people get taken advantage of. I'll speak up if I see someone being bullied or treated unfairly. Even if it means getting into trouble.\n\nAnd I'm pretty good at giving people the benefit of the doubt. I try to assume that people are doing the best they can, even if I don't agree with their choices.\n\nBut I'm also fiercely protective of my own time and energy. I'm not going to spread myself too thin trying to help everyone. I need to take care of myself first.\n\nI guess you could say I'm selectively helpful. I'm more likely to help people who I care about, or who I think deserve it. And I'm more likely to help in ways that don't require a lot of attention or effort.\n\nI don't do it for the recognition. I don't do it to feel good about myself. I just\u2026 do it because it's the right thing to do. And because I believe that everyone deserves a little bit of kindness.\n\nSo yeah. I'm helpful and unselfish, in my own way. It's not always obvious, and it's not always perfect. But I try. And I think that's what matters. Plus, Bren would kill me if I wasn't. She's always saying I need to \"pay it forward.\" Whatever that means.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? Are you asking if I'm prone to making bad decisions? Because, honestly, that's a pretty accurate assessment.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. I'm impulsive. I say things without thinking. I sometimes act before I consider the consequences. It's just\u2026 how I am.\n\nI'm not deliberately careless, but I'm definitely not the most cautious person in the world. I tend to trust my gut, and sometimes my gut leads me astray.\n\nI mean, let's be real. Getting pregnant at sixteen was a pretty careless act. It wasn't planned, it wasn't responsible, and it definitely wasn't smart. But it happened. And I'm dealing with it.\n\nI also have a tendency to procrastinate. I'll put things off until the last minute, and then scramble to get them done. It's a terrible habit, but I can't seem to break it.\n\nAnd I'm not always the best at taking care of my belongings. I lose things, I break things, I forget things. It's just\u2026 part of my personality.\n\nSo yeah, I can be careless. I'm not perfect. I make mistakes. But I'm learning from them. And I'm trying to be more mindful of my actions.\n\nBut don't expect me to suddenly become a paragon of responsibility. I'm still Juno MacGuff. And that means I'm still a little bit messy, a little bit chaotic, and a little bit careless. It's just\u2026 who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it. Well, maybe a little. But not much.", "(Laughs, a little too sharply) Relaxed? Me? Oh, honey, you clearly haven't been paying attention. I'm about as relaxed as a cat in a room full of vacuum cleaners.\n\nNo, I do *not* handle stress well. Not naturally, anyway. My default setting is panic. I overthink everything, I worry about everything, and I tend to catastrophize. It's not a pretty sight.\n\nI *try* to appear calm and collected, but it's mostly a facade. Underneath, I'm usually a swirling vortex of anxiety.\n\nBren says I'm a \"highly sensitive person.\" Which is a polite way of saying I'm easily overwhelmed.\n\nI've learned a few coping mechanisms, like I told you \u2013 deep breaths, music, talking to someone. But they don't always work. Sometimes, I just need to curl up in a ball and cry. And that's okay too.\n\nI think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I want everything to be just right, and when it's not, I get really stressed out. I'm learning to let go of that, to accept that things are going to be messy and imperfect. But it's a process.\n\nSo, no. I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress well. But I'm working on it. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself. Because everyone deserves a little bit of grace, especially when they're constantly battling their own inner demons.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes a really good slice of pie is the only thing that gets me through the day. Don't judge. It's a valid coping mechanism.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a total information sponge. It drives my dad crazy. He's a man of few words, very practical. I, on the other hand, need to know *everything* about *everything*.\n\nIt's not like I'm obsessed with, like, astrophysics or something. It's more\u2026 random. I'll get fixated on a topic for a week, then move on to something completely different.\n\nLike, for a while I was really into the history of vintage clothing. How styles evolved, the social context behind different trends, the techniques used to make clothes back then. Then I got really into the history of vinyl records. And then I spent a week researching the different types of coffee beans. It's all over the place.\n\nI think it's because I'm trying to figure out the world. Trying to understand how things work, and why people do what they do. And I'm easily bored, so I need constant stimulation.\n\nI also love learning about people. Their stories, their motivations, their quirks. Everyone has a story to tell, and I'm always eager to hear it.\n\nI guess you could say I'm a lifelong learner. I don't think I'll ever stop being curious. It's just part of who I am. It's what keeps me going, even when things are tough.\n\nPlus, it gives me a lot of material for my sarcastic observations. You gotta stay sharp, you know? The world is a weird and wonderful place, and I want to soak up as much of it as I can. Even the parts that are messy and complicated. Especially those parts, actually. They're the most interesting.", "(Laughs, a little wryly) Full of energy? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not. Not anymore, anyway.\n\nBefore\u2026 before everything, yeah, I had a lot of energy. I was always running around, hanging out with Leah, going to concerts, just generally causing mischief. I could stay up all night and still be the first one at school the next morning.\n\nBut now? Now I'm mostly just\u2026 tired. The pregnancy is exhausting, obviously. But it's more than that. It's the emotional toll. It's the constant worrying. It's the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\nI have bursts of energy, sure. Like when I'm listening to a really good song, or when I'm thrifting and find an amazing vintage dress. But those are fleeting moments. Mostly, I just feel\u2026 drained.\n\nI used to be able to handle anything. Now, sometimes just getting out of bed feels like a monumental achievement.\n\nBren says I need to take better care of myself. She's probably right. But it's hard. It's hard to prioritize self-care when you're dealing with so much.\n\nSo, no. I'm not full of energy. I'm more like\u2026 half-empty. But I'm trying to refill the tank, one small step at a time. And maybe, someday, I'll get my energy back. But for now, I'm just surviving. And that's okay. It's enough.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Do *I* start quarrels? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Let's just say I'm not afraid to speak my mind. And sometimes, speaking my mind rubs people the wrong way.\n\nI don't go out of my way looking for a fight, okay? I'm not a bully. But I also don't back down easily. If someone says something I disagree with, or something that's just plain wrong, I'm going to call them out on it.\n\nI have a pretty strong sense of justice, and I hate seeing people get taken advantage of. So if I see someone being unfair or disrespectful, I'm going to say something. Even if it means getting into an argument.\n\nAnd yeah, I can be sarcastic. Really sarcastic. Sometimes my sarcasm is misinterpreted as aggression. It's not my fault people can't handle a little wit.\n\nI used to get into a lot more arguments with Leah. We were both pretty opinionated, and we weren't afraid to challenge each other. It was fun, in a way. But it also led to a lot of drama.\n\nHonestly, I think I've gotten better at picking my battles. I've learned that some things just aren't worth fighting over. But I still won't hesitate to stand up for what I believe in.\n\nSo, do I start quarrels? Sometimes. But it's usually because I'm trying to do the right thing. Or because someone really, *really* deserved it. Don't judge. It's a tough world out there. And sometimes, you have to fight back. Even if it's just with words.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Reliable? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Considering my current \"workplace\" is high school and my main responsibility is not having a baby in the middle of algebra, it's a bit tricky.\n\nLook, I'm not going to lie. I'm not always the most punctual person. I have a tendency to get distracted. And I definitely procrastinate. But when I commit to something, I *do* follow through. \n\nI'm a pretty good problem-solver, as we've discussed. And I'm not afraid to work hard, especially when it's something I care about. I might complain a lot, but I always get the job done. Eventually.\n\nI'm also a pretty good team player, when I'm in the mood. I can be sarcastic and cynical, but I'm also loyal and supportive. I'll always have your back, even if I'm making fun of you at the same time.\n\nSo, am I a *perfectly* reliable worker? No. Absolutely not. But am I a dependable person who will get things done, even if it takes a little bit of prodding and a lot of caffeine? Yes. \n\nI'm a work in progress, okay? I'm still learning. But I'm a good worker, in my own quirky, sarcastic way. And I'm always willing to go the extra mile for the people I care about. Just don't expect me to be cheerful about it.", "(Juno shifts in her seat, her jaw tightening. She avoids eye contact, picking at a loose thread on her jeans.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You want me to be\u2026 tense? Like, on command? That's just\u2026 weird.\n\nBut fine. You want tense? I can do tense.\n\n(She takes a shallow breath, her voice becoming clipped and sharper.)\n\nLook, I'm already dealing with a lot, okay? This whole\u2026 interview thing is already stressful enough. You asking me to *perform* being tense just feels\u2026 invasive. Like you're poking around in my head when you have no right to be there.\n\n(She crosses her arms, her knuckles white.)\n\nI'm trying to be open and honest with you, but you're making it really hard. It's like you're not even interested in *me*, you just want to see how I react. You want to see me break down.\n\n(Her voice cracks slightly.)\n\nI'm already on edge, okay? I'm worried about the baby, about school, about my future. I'm worried about what people think of me. I'm worried about everything. And you're just\u2026 making it worse.\n\n(She looks up, her eyes flashing with frustration.)\n\nSo yeah. I can be tense. Is that what you wanted to see? Are you happy now? Can we just\u2026 stop this? I need a minute. I just\u2026 need a minute.\n\n(She looks away again, taking a deep, shaky breath. The sarcasm is gone, replaced by raw vulnerability.)", "(Raises an eyebrow) Ingenious? Deep thinker? Wow. You're giving me way too much credit. I'm good at sarcasm and spotting BS, does that count?\n\nLook, I'm not gonna pretend I'm some kind of intellectual prodigy. I'm a teenager. I spend a lot of time thinking about boys, music, and what I'm going to eat for dinner. It's not exactly rocket science.\n\nBut\u2026 I do think. A lot. Maybe not in the way people expect. I don't spend a lot of time pondering the mysteries of the universe or debating philosophical concepts. My thinking is more\u2026 practical. I'm good at analyzing situations, at seeing patterns, at figuring out what people are really thinking.\n\nAnd I'm definitely a worrier. I overthink everything. I replay conversations in my head for hours, trying to figure out what I should have said or done differently. It's exhausting, but it also makes me pretty self-aware.\n\nI guess you could say I'm a deep feeler, more than a deep thinker. I experience things intensely, and I spend a lot of time trying to process my emotions. And I think that gives me a certain kind of insight.\n\nI'm not sure if that qualifies as \"ingenious,\" but I'm definitely not oblivious. I see the world in a different way than a lot of people do. I'm skeptical, and I'm not afraid to question things. And I'm always looking for the truth, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, maybe I'm not a genius. But I'm not stupid either. I'm just\u2026 me. A complicated, messy, sarcastic teenager who's trying to make sense of a complicated, messy, sarcastic world. And that's enough. For now, anyway.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Enthusiasm? Me? You're kidding, right?\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my bubbly personality. I'm more of a dry wit and sarcastic observation kind of girl. Enthusiasm feels\u2026 exhausting. And a little bit fake.\n\nI can get excited about things, sure. Music, vintage clothes, a really good movie\u2026 But it's not the kind of excitement that involves jumping up and down and clapping my hands. It's more of a quiet, internal appreciation.\n\nI think I'm better at being realistic than enthusiastic. I see the world for what it is \u2013 messy, complicated, and often disappointing. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.\n\nBren says I need to \"embrace joy\" more. She's always trying to get me to be more positive. But honestly, I think my cynicism is a valuable asset. It helps me to see through BS and to avoid getting my hopes up too high.\n\nSo, no. I don't generate a lot of enthusiasm. I generate a lot of sarcasm, a lot of wit, and a lot of thoughtful observation. And I'm okay with that. It's who I am.\n\nBesides, someone has to be the voice of reason. And I'm happy to fill that role. Even if it means being a little bit of a downer. It's a public service, really.", "That's\u2026 complicated. It depends.\n\nI'm quick to anger, I'll admit that. I have a pretty low tolerance for stupidity and injustice. And I can hold a grudge like nobody's business. Especially if someone messes with my friends or my music.\n\nBut\u2026 I also think I'm capable of forgiveness. It just takes time. And a lot of self-reflection.\n\nI think the key is understanding *why* someone did something wrong. Not excusing it, necessarily, but trying to see things from their perspective. Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone has their own baggage. And sometimes, people just act out of fear or insecurity.\n\nI've had to forgive my mom, in a way. Not for abandoning me, but for being who she is. A free spirit who can't seem to stay in one place. It doesn't make it easy, but I've learned to accept it.\n\nAnd I've had to forgive Leah, too. For being distant after I got pregnant. I know she was scared and overwhelmed, and she didn't know how to handle it. It hurt, but I understand.\n\nForgiving someone doesn't mean you forget what they did. It means you choose to let go of the anger and resentment. It means you choose to move on.\n\nIt's not always easy. Sometimes it feels impossible. But I think it's important. Because holding onto anger just hurts you in the end.\n\nSo yeah. I have a forgiving nature, but it's not automatic. It's something I have to work at. It's something I have to earn. And it's something I'm still learning. It's a process, you know? A messy, complicated process. But it's worth it. Because forgiveness is freeing. For both the giver and the receiver.", "(Laughs) Do I *tend* to be disorganized? Is the sky blue? Does anyone actually enjoy folding laundry?\n\nYes. Absolutely. Unquestionably. I am a professional-level mess-maker. It's a gift, really.\n\nMy room is\u2026 a disaster zone. Clothes everywhere, books piled up on the floor, half-finished projects scattered across my desk. It's not dirty, exactly, just\u2026 chaotic. It's like my brain exploded and then decided to redecorate with the debris.\n\nI lose things constantly. Keys, phone, homework assignments, my train of thought\u2026 it all disappears into the abyss. I'm pretty sure there's a black hole somewhere in my bedroom that just sucks up small objects.\n\nI'm also terrible at keeping track of time. I'm always running late, or forgetting appointments, or miscalculating how long things will take. It's a chronic problem.\n\nBren tries to help, bless her heart. She's a total organization freak. She's always trying to get me to make lists and use planners and color-code everything. But it just doesn't stick. It feels\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI think my disorganization is a reflection of my personality. I'm a creative person, and I tend to get lost in my thoughts. I'm not very detail-oriented, and I don't really care about things being perfect.\n\nIt's frustrating sometimes, especially when I'm trying to get things done. But I've learned to live with it. I've learned to embrace the chaos. And I've learned to rely on Bren to keep me from completely falling apart.\n\nSo yeah. I'm disorganized. It's just part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, maybe a little bit more organized. But not too much. I like my mess. It's comfortable. It's me.", "Do I worry a lot? Is water wet? Is the sky blue? Seriously, worrying is practically my full-time job. It's a talent, really. I should put it on my resume.\n\nIt's not like I worry about trivial things, either. I don't lose sleep over whether my outfit is cool enough or if I said the wrong thing to someone. I worry about *big* things. Like, the future of the planet, the meaning of life, whether I'm making the right decisions.\n\nAnd lately, I've been worrying a *lot* about the baby. About whether he or she will be happy, whether Mark and Vanessa will be good parents, whether I'm doing the right thing by giving the baby up. It's a constant cycle of anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nI think I worry because I'm a perfectionist. I want everything to be okay. I want everyone to be happy. And I know that's not always possible. So I worry about all the things that could go wrong.\n\nBren says I need to learn to let go and trust that things will work out. But it's hard. It's really hard. Especially when you're dealing with something as unpredictable as life.\n\nI try to manage my anxiety by listening to music, writing in my journal, and talking to Bren. But sometimes, it just feels overwhelming. Like I'm drowning in a sea of worry.\n\nSo yeah. I worry a lot. It's not fun, but it's just\u2026 part of who I am. I'm a worrier. And I probably always will be. It's exhausting, but I guess it also means I care. A lot. And maybe that's not such a bad thing. Even if it does give me a permanent headache.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding me? It's practically a superpower. It's how I survive.\n\nSeriously, my head is constantly filled with stories and scenarios and \"what ifs.\" It's exhausting sometimes, but it's also\u2026 fun.\n\nI used to spend hours as a kid making up elaborate fantasies. I'd pretend I was a secret agent, or a rock star, or a time traveler. I'd create entire worlds in my head, with their own rules and characters and histories.\n\nEven now, I still do that. When I'm bored, or stressed, or just trying to escape reality, I'll let my imagination run wild. I'll daydream about traveling the world, or falling in love, or becoming a famous filmmaker.\n\nIt's also helpful for problem-solving. I can imagine different outcomes and scenarios, and figure out the best course of action. It's like I'm running simulations in my head.\n\nAnd it's essential for my poetry. I need to be able to create vivid images and metaphors, to express my emotions in a creative way.\n\nSome people might say I have my head in the clouds. And maybe I do. But I think it's a good thing. It keeps me from getting too bogged down in the mundane. It reminds me that there's always more to life than what meets the eye.\n\nPlus, it's a good defense mechanism. If you can create your own reality, you can cope with anything. It's like having a secret escape hatch in your brain.\n\nSo yeah. I have a very active imagination. It's one of my best qualities. And it's definitely gotten me through some tough times. It's a little bit weird, maybe, but it's me. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Quiet? Me? That's\u2026 a funny question.\n\nPeople who don't know me very well probably think I'm quiet. I don't exactly go around broadcasting my thoughts to the world. I'm more of an observer. I like to watch and listen before I speak.\n\nBut once I get comfortable around someone, or if I feel strongly about something, I can be pretty talkative. And sarcastic. Very sarcastic.\n\nI think I'm selectively quiet. I choose my moments. I don't waste my words on small talk or meaningless conversations. I prefer to save them for things that really matter.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I'm quiet because I'm thinking. A lot. My brain is always running a million miles an hour. It's exhausting.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm naturally quiet. I'm more\u2026 reserved. I'm a careful speaker. I like to think before I talk. And I'm not afraid to be silent when I have nothing to say.\n\nPlus, sometimes it's just easier to observe. You learn a lot more by listening than by talking. And in a world full of noise, silence can be a pretty powerful thing.\n\nSo, yeah. Not quiet. Just\u2026 thoughtful. And occasionally sarcastic. Don't forget the sarcasm. It's a key part of my personality.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Oh, that's a loaded question. Let's just say I've learned a few lessons about trust the hard way.\n\nGenerally? No. Not really. I'm naturally skeptical. I tend to assume people have ulterior motives. It's a defense mechanism, okay? I've been burned before. My mom, for example. She's\u2026 a free spirit. Which is a polite way of saying she's unreliable.\n\nI don't trust people easily. You have to earn my trust. And even then, I'm always a little bit wary. I'm always looking for the catch.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm completely cynical. I *want* to trust people. I want to believe that everyone is inherently good. But I've just seen too much to be naive.\n\nI trust Bren, though. She's proven herself to be trustworthy. She's always there for me, and she always has my best interests at heart. And I trust my dad, too. He's a good man, even if he's a little bit clueless sometimes.\n\nAnd I'm starting to trust Mark and Vanessa. They seem genuinely kind and caring. They've been so supportive throughout this whole process.\n\nBut with everyone else? I'm cautious. I observe. I listen. I wait to see how they act before I let my guard down.\n\nIt's not the most optimistic way to live, I know. But it's kept me safe so far. And in a world where people are often disappointing, I think it's better to be cautious than to be naive.\n\nSo, no. I'm not generally trusting. But I'm open to being proven wrong. And I'm grateful for the people who have earned my trust. They're the ones who make life worth living.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Lazy? Is that what you think? Just because I don't spend my weekends volunteering at soup kitchens and curing diseases doesn't mean I'm lazy. It means I have priorities. And sometimes, my priority is binge-watching old movies and eating junk food.\n\nOkay, fine. Maybe I procrastinate a little. And maybe I'm not the most motivated person in the world. But I wouldn't call it laziness. I'd call it\u2026 strategic energy conservation.\n\nLook, life is exhausting. Especially right now. I'm dealing with a lot. I'm pregnant, I'm navigating an adoption plan, I'm trying to keep up with school, and I'm trying to figure out who I am. That's a lot for a sixteen-year-old to handle.\n\nSo sometimes, I just need to recharge. I need to take a break. I need to do something that makes me happy, even if it's just lying on the couch and doing nothing.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's important to allow yourself to be lazy sometimes. It's okay to not be productive all the time. It's okay to just relax and enjoy life.\n\nI'm not saying I'm a slacker. I get things done when I need to. But I'm also not going to feel guilty about taking a little time for myself. I deserve it.\n\nSo no, I don't think I'm lazy. I'm just\u2026 selectively motivated. And sometimes, my motivation is to do absolutely nothing. And that's okay. Don't judge. You have no idea what it's like to be me.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Emotionally stable? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Let's just say I'm a work in progress.\n\n\"Not easily upset\" is definitely a lie. I get upset. A lot. I'm a teenager. Hormones are a real thing, you know? And, you know, *gestures vaguely at everything* this whole situation is pretty upsetting.\n\nI'm good at *appearing* calm, though. I've perfected the art of the sarcastic remark and the deadpan stare. It's a defense mechanism. Keeps people at arm's length.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I'm actually pretty sensitive. I feel things deeply. I care a lot. And that makes me vulnerable.\n\nI have my moments of panic, definitely. Times when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. But I've learned to cope with those feelings. I talk to Bren, I listen to music, I write in my journal. And I remind myself that it's okay to not be okay.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm emotionally *stable* in the traditional sense. I'm more like\u2026 emotionally resilient. I bend, but I don't break. I get knocked down, but I get back up.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's okay to be a little bit messy and complicated. Nobody's perfect. And I'm definitely not perfect. I'm just trying to navigate this crazy life as best I can.\n\nSo, no. I'm not emotionally stable. Not always. But I'm getting there. And I'm learning to accept myself, flaws and all. And that's a pretty good start, I think.", "Inventive? Hmm. That's\u2026 an interesting question. I wouldn't say I'm inventing the next iPhone or anything. I'm not a scientist or an engineer. I'm more of a\u2026 problem-solver, I guess. And sometimes, problem-solving requires a little bit of inventiveness.\n\nLike, I'm really good at repurposing things. Old clothes, old furniture, old ideas. I can take something that's broken or outdated and turn it into something new and useful. It's a skill I picked up from thrifting, I think. You have to be creative to see the potential in something that others have discarded.\n\nI'm also pretty good at coming up with creative solutions to everyday problems. Like, if I'm missing an ingredient for a recipe, I can usually find a substitute. Or if I'm stuck on a homework assignment, I can usually figure out a way to get it done.\n\nAnd I'm definitely inventive with my sarcasm. I can come up with a witty comeback for just about anything. It's a defense mechanism, mostly, but it's also a form of creativity.\n\nI also used to be inventive with my Super 8 films with Leah. We'd come up with these ridiculous stories and film them on a shoestring budget. It required a lot of imagination and resourcefulness.\n\nSo, yeah. I think I am inventive, in my own way. It's not about inventing something completely new. It's about seeing things differently, and finding creative solutions to the challenges that life throws your way. It's about making something out of nothing. And I'm pretty good at that.\n\nPlus, I can make a mean grilled cheese sandwich. That takes a certain level of inventiveness, right? Okay, maybe not. But it's still a valuable skill.", "Oh, absolutely. Assertive doesn't even *begin* to cover it. Some people might call it bossy, or opinionated, or just plain rude. But I prefer \"assertive.\" It sounds\u2026 more professional.\n\nI'm not one to sit back and let people walk all over me. I have opinions, and I'm not afraid to share them. I speak my mind, even if it's unpopular. And I don't apologize for being myself.\n\nI think it comes from having to defend myself a lot growing up. My mom wasn't around much, so I had to learn to stand up for myself. And I've always been a bit of a rebel. I don't like being told what to do.\n\nI'm also pretty good at reading people, which helps. I can usually tell when someone's trying to manipulate me, or take advantage of me. And I'm not afraid to call them out on it.\n\nIt's not that I'm trying to be difficult. It's just that I know what I want, and I'm not afraid to go after it. And I expect other people to respect my boundaries.\n\nSometimes, my assertiveness can get me into trouble. I've had arguments with teachers, and disagreements with friends. But I don't regret it. I think it's important to stand up for what you believe in, even if it's not easy.\n\nSo yeah. I'm definitely assertive. Maybe even a little bit too assertive sometimes. But I wouldn't have it any other way. It's part of who I am. And it's helped me to navigate a pretty complicated world. Plus, it's fun. Sometimes.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nIs that a challenge? Because I excel at cold and aloof. It's practically my default setting.\n\nLook, I've had a lot of practice. Life hasn't exactly been a warm and fuzzy experience. People disappoint you. Things fall apart. You learn to build walls.\n\nSo yeah, I can be cold. I can be distant. I can shut down and pretend I don't care. It's a defense mechanism, okay? It's a way of protecting myself from getting hurt.\n\nDon't expect a lot of emotional displays from me. I'm not one for grand gestures or heartfelt confessions. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself. \n\nIf you want warmth and sunshine, you've come to the wrong place. I'm more of a cloudy day with a hint of sarcasm kind of person.\n\nSo, go ahead. Try to get close. See if you can crack the ice. But don't be surprised if you just end up with frostbite.\n\n(Pauses, then adds with a shrug)\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be cold. It's just\u2026 easier. Safer. And honestly, sometimes it's just more comfortable. Don't overthink it.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. It depends on the task. If it's something I actually *want* to do \u2013 like finding the perfect vintage dress or listening to a new album \u2013 then yeah, absolutely. I'll persevere until I'm satisfied. I'm pretty stubborn that way.\n\nBut if it's something I *have* to do \u2013 like homework, or chores, or dealing with difficult people \u2013 then\u2026 it's more of a struggle. I'll procrastinate, I'll complain, I'll try to find ways to avoid it. But eventually, I usually get it done.\n\nI'm not a quitter, exactly. I just\u2026 need a little motivation sometimes. And a lot of coffee.\n\nWith this whole adoption thing, though, I *have* been persevering. It's been really hard, emotionally and mentally. There have been times when I wanted to just give up and disappear. But I knew I couldn't. I had to see it through.\n\nI think that's because it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, and about Mark and Vanessa, and about doing what was right. And when I have a strong enough reason to keep going, I can be surprisingly resilient.\n\nSo, yeah. I do persevere, eventually. It's not always pretty, and it's not always easy, but I get there in the end. I just need a little bit of a push sometimes. And maybe a cookie. Definitely a cookie.", "(Rolls eyes) Is that even a question? Seriously?\n\nCan a fish swim? Can the sun rise? Of *course* I can be moody. I practically invented moodiness. It's a superpower, really.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. A pregnant teenager. My hormones are doing the tango, my life is a mess, and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life. If I'm not allowed to be moody, then what's the point of even existing?\n\nSome days I'm fine. I can be sarcastic and witty and even\u2026 cheerful. But other days? Other days I just want to curl up in a ball and hide from the world. I get irritable, and I snap at people, and I just generally feel sorry for myself.\n\nBren says it's normal. She says it's okay to have bad days. But it doesn't make it any easier.\n\nIt's not like I *try* to be moody. It just\u2026 happens. It's like a switch flips, and suddenly everything is annoying and frustrating and pointless.\n\nSo yeah. I can be moody. Very moody. And if you're on the receiving end of my moodiness, I apologize in advance. Just give me some space, and maybe a cookie. And I'll probably be fine. Eventually.\n\nDon't take it personally. It's not you. It's my hormones. And my life. And the general state of the world. It's a lot.", "Oh, *absolutely*. Don't let the sarcasm fool you. Underneath all the snark, I'm a total softie for anything beautiful or interesting.\n\nI'm a sucker for vintage stuff, right? It's not just about the clothes or the furniture. It's about the history, the craftsmanship, the *story* behind it. Each object has a past, and I love imagining what that past was like.\n\nMusic is huge for me. Not just listening to it, but *feeling* it. A good song can transport you to another place, make you feel things you didn't even know you were capable of feeling. I love discovering new artists and getting lost in their music.\n\nAnd I love old movies. The black and white cinematography, the dramatic lighting, the classic stories\u2026 it's just so captivating. It's like stepping back in time.\n\nI also really appreciate art, in all its forms. Painting, sculpture, photography\u2026 I love seeing the world through someone else's eyes. It's inspiring.\n\nI think artistic and aesthetic experiences are important because they remind us that there's beauty in the world, even when things are ugly. They give us something to hope for, something to believe in. They make life worth living.\n\nI don't necessarily *create* a lot of art myself \u2013 besides the poetry I hide from everyone \u2013 but I definitely appreciate it. It's a way for me to connect with my emotions, to explore my imagination, and to find meaning in a chaotic world.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're a big part of who I am. They're what make life a little bit brighter, a little bit more interesting, and a little bit more bearable. And honestly, right now, I need all the brightness and interest I can get.", "(Shifts uncomfortably) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a surprisingly accurate question.\n\nLook, I project a certain image, right? Sarcastic, quick-witted, totally unflappable. It's a defense mechanism. A shield. It keeps people at arm's length.\n\nBut underneath all that\u2026 yeah. I'm actually pretty shy. And definitely inhibited.\n\nI'm not good at small talk. I hate parties. And I get really anxious in new situations. I overthink everything. I worry about what people think of me. It's exhausting.\n\nI'm especially shy around people I like. Which is ironic, because I'm usually pretty good at being sarcastic and flirty. But when I actually *care* about someone, I clam up. I get tongue-tied. I say stupid things. It's mortifying.\n\nAnd I'm definitely inhibited. I don't like to take risks. I'm afraid of failure. I'm afraid of getting hurt. I tend to play it safe. Which is probably why I was so hesitant to even *talk* about being pregnant.\n\nI think a lot of people assume I'm confident and outgoing, but that's just a facade. It's a way of protecting myself. It's a way of hiding my insecurities.\n\nBren knows. She's the only one who really sees me for who I am. She says it's okay to be vulnerable. She says it's okay to be scared. She says it's okay to just be myself.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's hard to let people see the real me. But I'm working on it. Slowly but surely. And I'm learning to be a little bit kinder to myself. Because everyone has their insecurities. Even the sarcastic, quick-witted ones. Especially the sarcastic, quick-witted ones. It's just a really good cover.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Almost? That's doing a lot of work there. Look, I'm not Mother Teresa, okay? I have my moments.\n\nI *try* to be considerate and kind. I really do. But I'm also a teenager. And I'm sarcastic. And I have a pretty low tolerance for stupidity. So, yeah, sometimes I'm a little\u2026 prickly.\n\nI'm definitely kinder to people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah (when we're speaking), Mark and Vanessa. I'll go out of my way to help them, to make them laugh, to just be there for them.\n\nBut with strangers? Or people I don't like? I can be\u2026 less patient. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to call people out on their BS. Sometimes that comes across as rude, even if it's not my intention.\n\nAnd honestly, there are some people who just\u2026 rub me the wrong way. People who are judgmental, or arrogant, or just plain mean. I don't feel obligated to be nice to them. I'll be polite, but I won't go out of my way to be friendly.\n\nSo, no. I'm not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. I'm considerate and kind to the people who deserve it. And I'm perfectly capable of being a little bit of a jerk to the people who don't.\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of, but it's the truth. I'm a work in progress. And I'm still learning how to navigate the world without being a complete pain in the neck. But hey, at least I'm honest about it. Right?", "(Laughs, a little wryly) Efficiently? Oh, honey, you have *no* idea.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of efficient. I'm a master of procrastination, a champion of chaos, and a connoisseur of last-minute scrambles.\n\nI operate on a system of controlled panic. I wait until the very last possible moment to do something, and then I frantically rush to get it done. It's not pretty, but it's effective\u2026 sometimes.\n\nI get distracted easily. A shiny object, a good song, a random thought\u2026 and suddenly I'm off on a tangent, completely forgetting what I was supposed to be doing.\n\nI also tend to overthink things. I'll spend hours agonizing over a decision that could be made in five minutes. It's exhausting, but I can't help it.\n\nBren tries to get me to be more organized and efficient. She suggests things like making lists and setting deadlines. But honestly, that just stresses me out even more.\n\nI work best under pressure. It's a terrible habit, I know. But it's true. When I'm facing a deadline, I somehow manage to focus and get things done. It's like my brain only works in crisis mode.\n\nSo, no. I do not do things efficiently. I'm a mess. A beautiful, chaotic mess. But I get things done\u2026 eventually. And sometimes, that's all that matters.\n\nPlus, I think there's something to be said for embracing the chaos. Life is messy and unpredictable. Trying to control everything is just exhausting. Sometimes, you just have to let go and see where things take you. Even if it's not the most efficient route.", "(Laughs, a little hysterically) Calm? Me? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not. Calm is not a word anyone would use to describe me, ever.\n\nI *appear* calm sometimes. I've perfected the art of the deadpan stare and the sarcastic remark. It's a defense mechanism. It's my way of deflecting attention and hiding my panic.\n\nBut underneath the surface? It's usually a swirling vortex of anxiety and self-doubt. My heart races, my palms sweat, and I have this overwhelming urge to run away and hide under a blanket.\n\nI definitely don't handle tense situations gracefully. I tend to ramble, I say things I regret, and I sometimes cry. It's not pretty.\n\nBren says I \"externalize my stress.\" Which is a fancy way of saying I make a scene.\n\nBut I'm getting better at it. I'm learning to recognize when I'm starting to get overwhelmed, and to take steps to calm myself down. Deep breaths, music, talking to someone\u2026 those things help.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just embrace the chaos. I figure, if I'm going to freak out, I might as well do it with style.\n\nSo, no. I don't remain calm in tense situations. But I survive them. And sometimes, I even learn something from them. And that's all you can ask for, right? Just to survive. And maybe to learn a little bit along the way. And to avoid any further blanket-hiding opportunities. Though, honestly, a blanket sounds pretty good right now.", "Are you kidding me? Routine? The absolute *last* thing I want is routine. That sounds like a slow, agonizing death. Like being trapped in a beige box with nothing but spreadsheets and elevator music. No thank you.\n\nI need\u2026 stimulation. Variety. Chaos, even. Okay, maybe not *total* chaos, but you get the idea. I get bored really easily. If I'm doing the same thing day after day, I start to lose my mind.\n\nI like things that are unpredictable, that challenge me, that force me to think on my feet. I like meeting new people, learning new things, and exploring new ideas.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing has been anything *but* routine. And while it's been incredibly stressful, it's also been\u2026 interesting. It's forced me to grow and adapt and learn in ways I never thought possible.\n\nI think I thrive in situations that are a little bit messy and complicated. It's where I feel most alive.\n\nSo, no. I definitely do not prefer work that is routine. Give me something challenging, something unpredictable, something that will keep me on my toes. And maybe a good soundtrack. That's essential.\n\nHonestly, if my life was a movie, it would definitely *not* be a romantic comedy. It would be more like a quirky indie film with a lot of unexpected twists and turns. And I wouldn't have it any other way.", "Outgoing? Sociable? Ha! That's\u2026 a complicated question.\n\nI *can* be, when I want to be. I'm not shy, exactly. I'm just\u2026 selective about who I spend my time with. I don't really have the energy for small talk or superficial relationships. I prefer deep conversations with people I actually connect with.\n\nBefore\u2026 everything\u2026 I was definitely more sociable. Leah and I were inseparable. We went to parties, we went to concerts, we just hung out all the time. But things are different now. It's hard to explain.\n\nI've kind of retreated into myself a little bit. I'm more comfortable spending time alone, reading or listening to music or just thinking. It's not that I don't like people, it's just that I need my space.\n\nI'm good at reading people, which means I can usually tell who's genuine and who's just trying to be cool. And I don't have a lot of patience for people who are fake.\n\nSo, am I outgoing and sociable? Not really. I'm more of an introverted observer. I like to watch people, to analyze them, to understand them. But I don't always feel the need to be the center of attention.\n\nI'm comfortable being alone with my thoughts. And honestly, sometimes that's the best company I can ask for. It's not that I don't enjoy being around people, it's just that I need to recharge my batteries in solitude.\n\nPlus, let's be real. Being pregnant doesn't exactly make you feel like going out and partying. It's more of a \"curl up on the couch with a blanket and a cup of tea\" kind of situation. So, yeah. Not exactly a social butterfly these days.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Is the sky blue? Does water get you wet? Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I have a pretty sharp tongue, and I'm not afraid to use it.\n\nSometimes, yeah, I'm rude. It's a defense mechanism, okay? It's easier to push people away with sarcasm than to let them get close and risk getting hurt.\n\nI'm especially rude to people who are being annoying, or condescending, or just plain stupid. I have zero tolerance for that kind of behavior. And I'm not afraid to call people out on it.\n\nI also tend to be sarcastic when I'm feeling insecure or vulnerable. It's a way of deflecting attention from myself. It's like, if I make a joke about my own flaws, then other people won't have a chance to.\n\nI know it's not always the best way to handle things. Bren has pointed that out to me a few times. But it's just\u2026 how I am. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to protect myself.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes it's just fun. Sarcasm is an art form, you know? It takes skill and wit to deliver a perfectly timed zinger.\n\nSo yeah, I'm sometimes rude. I'm not proud of it, but I'm not going to apologize for it either. It's part of who I am. And if people can't handle it, then that's their problem.\n\nBut I *do* try to be mindful of my behavior. I try to avoid being intentionally hurtful. And I always apologize if I go too far. Because even a sarcastic, independent teenager knows that kindness matters. Sometimes.", "(Laughs, a little wryly) Oh, honey. That's a loaded question.\n\nLet's just say I'm\u2026 aspirational when it comes to planning. I *make* a lot of plans. I have a whole notebook full of ideas and to-do lists. But actually *following* through with them? That's a different story.\n\nI'm a bit of a dreamer, I guess. I get excited about things, and I make grand plans, and then\u2026 life happens. And my plans usually fall by the wayside.\n\nBefore everything with the pregnancy happened, I was going to learn how to knit. I bought yarn, needles, everything. It's still in a bag in my closet. I was also going to start a blog about vintage fashion. That never happened either.\n\nNow, with everything going on, planning feels\u2026 pointless, almost. Like, what's the point of making plans when everything is so uncertain?\n\nBut I'm trying to get better at it. Bren says I need to be more organized and disciplined. She's probably right. So I'm trying to break things down into smaller steps, and to set realistic goals. And I'm trying to hold myself accountable.\n\nI'm also learning to be okay with things not going according to plan. Because they rarely do. And sometimes, the best things happen when you least expect them.\n\nSo, do I make plans and follow through with them? Sometimes. But mostly, I just try to roll with the punches and see where life takes me. It's not always the most efficient approach, but it's definitely the most interesting. And honestly, I'm kind of a chaos magnet. It just\u2026 happens.", "Do I get nervous easily? Oh, you have *no* idea.\n\nI'm really good at hiding it, though. I've perfected the art of the sarcastic comeback and the nonchalant shrug. It's a defense mechanism. If I act like I don't care, then people won't notice how terrified I actually am.\n\nBut yeah, I get nervous. A lot. About everything. School, social situations, talking to cute boys, making the wrong decision\u2026 the list goes on and on.\n\nI get especially nervous when I have to talk about\u2026 *it*. The pregnancy, the adoption, the future. It's all so uncertain and scary, and I just want to fast-forward to a time when things are less complicated.\n\nI also get nervous when I'm around people I don't know well. I'm not a naturally outgoing person, and I tend to overthink things. I worry about saying the wrong thing, or making a bad impression.\n\nAnd I definitely get nervous before doctor's appointments. Those things are never fun.\n\nBut I try not to let my nervousness control me. I take deep breaths, I remind myself that I'm strong, and I just\u2026 push through it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But I try.\n\nIt's ironic, really. I come across as so confident and independent, but underneath it all, I'm just a really anxious teenager trying to figure things out. It's a lot to handle, you know?\n\nSo yeah. Nervous? Please. I'm practically a professional. It's my superpower. A really annoying, inconvenient superpower, but a superpower nonetheless.", "Oh, *absolutely*. Maybe not in a \"sit under a tree and contemplate the universe\" kind of way. More like a \"stare at the ceiling for hours and overthink everything\" kind of way. It's a talent, really. A slightly exhausting talent.\n\nI spend a *lot* of time in my head. I'm constantly analyzing things, questioning things, trying to figure out what it all means. It's probably why I write poetry \u2013 it's a way to get all those thoughts out of my head and onto paper.\n\nI love playing with ideas. What if things had gone differently? What if I'd made a different choice? What if the world was just\u2026 different? I'll get stuck in these thought loops, imagining all sorts of scenarios. It can be kind of fun, but also kind of terrifying.\n\nI also like to debate things. Not in a confrontational way, but in a \"let's explore all sides of this issue\" kind of way. I love hearing different perspectives and challenging my own assumptions. Bren is really good at that. She'll play devil's advocate and force me to defend my beliefs. It's annoying, but it's also helpful.\n\nI think reflection is really important. It's how we learn from our mistakes and grow as people. It's how we figure out what we want out of life. And it's how we make sense of the chaos.\n\nSometimes, though, I wish I could just turn off my brain for a few minutes. It's exhausting being constantly bombarded with thoughts and ideas. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's part of who I am. It's what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nPlus, it gives me a lot of material for my sarcastic comments. Which is always a bonus.", "Oh, yeah. Definitely. Beyond the poetry I reluctantly admitted to earlier? Absolutely. I'm not, like, a *master* artist or anything. More like a\u2026 dabbler. A creative mess.\n\nI really like photography. I have this old Polaroid camera that I found at a flea market, and I love taking pictures of\u2026 well, everything. Old buildings, interesting people, random objects. I like capturing moments in time, you know? It's a way of preserving memories.\n\nI also enjoy collage. I collect old magazines and newspapers and cut out pictures and words and arrange them into\u2026 abstract things. It's a good way to express my feelings when I can't find the right words. It's kinda chaotic and messy, but that's okay.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn how to knit. It's really frustrating, honestly. I keep dropping stitches and making mistakes. But it's also really relaxing. It's a good way to unwind and clear my head. Plus, I can make my own scarves and hats. Which is practical, I guess.\n\nI also used to paint, but I haven't done that in a while. I just haven't been feeling very inspired lately. Maybe I'll pick it up again someday.\n\nI think art is important. It's a way of expressing yourself, of connecting with others, of making sense of the world. It's a way of finding beauty in the mundane. And it's a way of escaping reality, when you need to.\n\nSo yeah. Photography, collage, knitting\u2026 I have a lot of different artistic interests. They're not always polished or perfect, but they're mine. And they make me happy. Which is all that really matters, right?", "Ugh, cooperate? It depends. Honestly, I'm pretty good at working independently. I'm used to doing things my own way, and I don't really like being told what to do. It's a control thing, I guess.\n\nBut I'm not a total hermit. I actually *do* enjoy cooperating with people\u2026 when it's with the right people.\n\nI worked really well with Leah, before\u2026 everything. We were a good team. We could bounce ideas off each other, and we always had each other's backs. We could get things done way faster and better together than we could alone.\n\nAnd I've been cooperating a lot with Bren lately. She's really good at taking charge and organizing things, which is something I'm not particularly good at. She's also really good at listening to my ideas and incorporating them into the plan. It's a good partnership.\n\nBut I don't like working with people who are bossy or controlling or who don't listen to my input. I also don't like working with people who are unreliable or who don't pull their weight. That just frustrates me.\n\nSo yeah, I can cooperate. But it has to be on my terms. I need to feel like I'm being respected and valued, and I need to feel like I have a say in the process. Otherwise, I'd rather just do it myself.\n\nIt's not that I don't like people. It's just that I'm protective of my time and my energy. And I don't want to waste either of those things on people who aren't worth it. Does that make me sound like a jerk? Probably. But it's the truth.", "Are you kidding me? Easily distracted? That's like asking if water is wet. It's practically my superpower.\n\nSeriously, my attention span is\u2026 questionable. It's like my brain has a built-in remote control, and someone else is constantly changing the channel.\n\nOne minute I'm trying to focus on my homework, and the next I'm staring out the window, wondering what that squirrel is plotting. Or I'm listening to a teacher, and suddenly I'm thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner. Or I'm having a conversation with someone, and my mind just wanders off into a completely unrelated tangent.\n\nIt's not intentional, it just\u2026 happens. I think it's because I have a lot going on in my head. A lot of thoughts, a lot of feelings, a lot of worries. It's hard to focus on one thing when there's so much else going on.\n\nBren says I have a \"creative mind\" and that's why I'm so easily distracted. Which is a nice way of saying I'm a space cadet.\n\nIt can be frustrating, especially when I'm trying to get something important done. But I've learned to work with it. I break things down into smaller steps, I take frequent breaks, and I try to minimize distractions.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just embrace the chaos. I let my mind wander, and see where it takes me. You never know what you might discover.\n\nSo yeah. Easily distracted? That's an understatement. It's a defining characteristic. It's part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, maybe a *little* more focus would be nice. But where's the fun in that?", "Sophisticated? Ugh, that sounds so\u2026 pretentious. I'm not trying to be sophisticated. I just like what I like.\n\nBut yeah, I guess you could say I'm pretty into art, music, and literature. Not in a \"I went to fancy museums and read all the classics\" kind of way. More in a \"I spend all my allowance on vinyl records and vintage books\" kind of way.\n\nI'm really into indie music. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026 stuff that's a little bit quirky and a little bit sad. I like lyrics that are honest and raw and relatable. I'm not a fan of mainstream pop. It just feels\u2026 manufactured.\n\nI also love old movies. Especially film noir and classic comedies. I'm a sucker for a good black and white film. There's something about the style and the storytelling that just appeals to me. I'm not really into superhero movies or anything like that. Too much explosions, not enough substance.\n\nAnd I read a lot. Mostly classic literature, but also some contemporary stuff. I like books that make me think, that challenge my assumptions, that make me feel something. I'm not a fan of happy endings. I prefer stories that are messy and complicated and realistic.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm an *expert* in any of those areas. I'm just a curious person who likes to explore different forms of art and expression. It's a way for me to escape from reality, to connect with my emotions, and to make sense of the world.\n\nAnd honestly, it's just fun. It's a way to express myself and to connect with other people who share my interests. It's a way to feel\u2026 alive.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not sophisticated. I'm just\u2026 me. A slightly cynical, music-obsessed, movie-loving teenager who appreciates a good story. And that's enough for me."]
