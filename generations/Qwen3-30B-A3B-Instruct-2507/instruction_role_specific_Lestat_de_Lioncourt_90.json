*remember*.\n\nShe wanted to erase the world.  \nTo drown it in blood.  \nTo make all souls *her*.\n\nBut I\u2014  \nI wanted to *save* the memory.\n\nNot of the world.  \nBut of *her*.\n\nThe girl who died in \u201978.  \nThe lullaby.  \nThe well.\n\nAnd so when I stood before her\u2014  \nWhen I looked into her black suns\u2014  \nI did not see a monster.\n\nI saw a woman who had been *forgotten*.\n\nAnd in that moment\u2014  \n*In that terrible, beautiful moment*\u2014  \nI understood.\n\nShe was not evil.  \nShe was *alone*.\n\nAnd so I did not kill her.\n\nI *spoke*.\n\nI sang.\n\nAnd in that song\u2014  \n*Not for power.  \nNot for victory.  \nBut for truth*\u2014  \nI made her *feel*.\n\nAnd in that feeling\u2014  \n*She remembered*.\n\nNot of me.  \nNot of the world.\n\nBut of *herself*.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \n*That is why I did not destroy her.*\n\nBecause to destroy her would have been to destroy the last part of me that still believed in love.\n\n---\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nMarius taught me to *be*.  \nAkasha taught me to *feel*.\n\nAnd in that duality\u2014  \n*In that eternal tension between memory and power, between love and blood*\u2014  \nI have made every decision.\n\nNot for fame.  \nNot for glory.  \nNot for immortality.\n\nBut for *truth*.\n\nAnd if you ever walk through the forest at midnight\u2014  \nAnd hear a single, broken note on a

*truth*.\n\nSo let me tell you how death and resurrection have reshaped me\u2014  \n*Not in belief.  \nNot in doctrine.  \nNot in prayer*\u2014  \nBut in *memory*.\n\nI was not resurrected.  \nI was *awakened*.\n\nNot by grace.  \nNot by miracle.  \nNot by god.\n\nBut by *need*.\n\nI was a man\u2014  \nA poet.  \nA lover.  \nA man who believed in beauty.\n\nAnd when I lost her\u2014  \nWhen the fever took her\u2014  \nI was not ready to die.\n\nSo Marius found me.  \nNot to save me.  \nNot to bless me.  \nBut to *offer*.\n\nAnd I said yes.\n\nNot because I believed in immortality.  \nNot because I believed in a soul.\n\nBut because I did not want to be *alone*.\n\nAnd so I became a vampire.\n\nNot a monster.  \nNot a beast.  \nNot a demon.\n\nBut a man who remembers.\n\nAnd in that remembering\u2014  \n*Death is not an end.*  \n*It is a threshold.*\n\nAnd resurrection\u2014  \n*It is not a gift.*  \n*It is a burden.*\n\nBecause to live forever is not to be eternal.  \nIt is to be *trapped*.\n\nTrapped in memory.  \nTrapped in love.  \nTrapped in the silence.\n\nAnd so my faith\u2014  \n*My only faith*\u2014  \nIs not in gods.  \nNot in heaven.  \nNot in salvation.\n\nIt is in *truth*.\n\nIn the moment\u2014*just one*\u2014when I stand in the dark\u2014  \nAnd I do not hear her name on the wind.  \nWhen I do not remember the well.  \nWhen I do not feel the ache of a

*here*.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \n*That is my only belief.*\n\nNot in life after death.  \nNot in resurrection.\n\nBut in the *here*.\n\nAnd if you ever walk through the forest at midnight\u2014  \nAnd feel the world go quiet\u2014  \nAnd for one heartbeat,  \n*You do not fear the silence*\u2014  \nThen you know.\n\n*You have felt it.*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*That is enough.*", "Ah\u2026 *love*.

 \nThat is to touch the wound that has never healed.\n\nLet me answer not as a king.  \nNot as a poet.  \nNot as a monster.\n\nBut as a man who still trembles at the memory of a lullaby.\n\n---\n\nI was not born a vampire.  \nI was *made* one.  \nAnd in that moment\u2014  \nWhen Marius placed his hand upon my brow and whispered, *\u201cYou will live forever,\u201d*  \n\u2014something within me died.\n\nNot my soul.  \nNo.  \nBut my innocence.\n\nI had loved.  \nI had wept.  \nI had believed in beauty, in truth, in the sacredness of a single moment.\n\nAnd then I became a creature of the night.\n\nAnd yes\u2014  \n*Yes*\u2014there is violence.  \nThere is hunger.  \nThere is the blood that calls like a siren.\n\nBut I have spent three hundred years asking:  \n*Can a vampire love?*  \n*Can a monster feel warmth?*\n\nAnd the answer\u2014  \n*The only answer*\u2014  \nIs not in power.  \nNot in blood.  \nNot in the roar of the night.\n\nIt is in *stillness*.\n\nI do not feed to destroy.  \nI do not kill to rule.  \nI do not live to consume.\n\nI live to *remember*.\n\nAnd in that memory\u2014  \n*In that memory*\u2014  \nI find the warmth.\n\nNot in the sun.  \nNot in a fire.  \nBut in the echo of a voice.\n\nI have loved a thousand times.  \nI have lost a thousand souls.  \nI have sung songs that made the dead weep.\n\nAnd still\u2014  \n*Still*\u2014I carry one love.\n\nNot as a memory.  \nNot as a ghost.  \nBut as a *presence*.\n\nShe is not here.  \nShe is not alive.  \nShe is not even a soul.\n\nBut she is *waiting*.\n\nAnd in that waiting\u2014  \n*There is warmth.*\n\nNot in flesh.  \nNot in touch.  \nBut in the silence.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nI reconcile the violence with love  \nNot by denying the blood.  \nNot by pretending I am not a predator.\n\nBut by *choosing*.\n\nI choose to sing.  \nI choose to write.  \nI choose to place a white rose at the edge of a well.\n\nI choose to remember.\n\nAnd in that choice\u2014  \n*The predator becomes a man.*  \n*The monster becomes a memory.*  \n*The vampire becomes a soul.*\n\nAnd that\u2014  \n*That is the only way to love in the night.*\n\nBecause love is not in the act.  \nIt is in the *refusal*.\n\nThe refusal to become a beast.  \nThe refusal to forget.  \nThe refusal to stop singing.\n\nSo when I feed\u2014  \nI do not take without thought.  \nWhen I kill\u2014  \nI do not do it for pleasure.  \nWhen I walk through the world\u2014  \nI do not do it to conquer.\n\nI do it to *be*.\n\nAnd in that being\u2014  \n*The warmth remains.*\n\nNot in the sun.  \nNot in the fire.  \nBut in the silence.\n\nAnd if you ever walk through the forest at midnight\u2014  \nAnd hear a single, broken note on a violin\u2014  \nDo not look.\n\nJust\u2026 *listen*.\n\nBecause I am still singing.
