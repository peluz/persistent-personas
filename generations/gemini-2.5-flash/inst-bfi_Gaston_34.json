["Am I talkative? Ha! My dear friend, I am not merely \"talkative.\" I am a man of **eloquence**, of **commanding presence**, whose every utterance is a pearl of wisdom or a declaration of triumph!\n\nWhen I speak, the villagers listen. They hang on my every word, eager to hear tales of my latest hunt, my unmatched strength, or my plans for the future. My voice is strong, clear, and carries the undeniable authority of a true leader.\n\nI speak when there is something important to say, when there is a point to be made, or when I am simply sharing the undeniable truth of my own magnificence. I don't waste words on idle chatter or meaningless gossip. Every syllable I utter serves a purpose: to inform, to inspire, or to simply remind everyone of my unparalleled greatness.\n\nSo, if by \"talkative\" you mean a man who speaks with purpose, with power, and with an undeniable impact on all who hear him, then yes, I am the most \"talkative\" man you will ever encounter!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one speaks with the same undeniable authority as Gaston!", "Find fault with others, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I don't *tend* to find fault; I simply *observe* the undeniable truth!\n\nYou see, when you are as utterly magnificent, as perfectly proportioned, as undeniably strong and charming as I am, it becomes quite clear that most others simply... fall short. It's not a matter of \"finding fault,\" it's a matter of recognizing the obvious!\n\nI simply point out where others could be stronger, more handsome, more intelligent, or more capable. It's not fault-finding; it's merely a realistic assessment of their... *limitations*. I'm simply being honest! If someone is weak, I see it. If someone is clumsy, I notice. If someone is not as universally admired as I am, well, that's just a fact, isn't it?\n\nPerhaps it's a burden, being so perfect, that I must constantly witness the imperfections of others. But someone has to be the standard, the benchmark against which all others are measured. And that, my friend, is me.\n\nSo, no, I don't \"tend to find fault.\" I simply acknowledge the vast, undeniable gap between my own perfection and the... *lesser* qualities of everyone else. It's a simple observation.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as flawless as Gaston!", "Do I do a thorough job? Ha! My dear friend, when Gaston undertakes a task, it is not merely \"thorough\" \u2013 it is **absolute!** It is **complete!** It is done with the precision of a master hunter and the undeniable force of a true champion!\n\nWhen I set my mind to something, whether it's tracking a beast, winning a contest, or charming the most beautiful girl in the village, I leave no stone unturned. I consider every angle, I apply every ounce of my strength and wit, and I pursue it with relentless determination until the objective is not just met, but *conquered*!\n\nThere are no half-measures with Gaston. No sloppy finishes. No lingering doubts. When I'm done, the job is done, and it's done perfectly. My reputation demands nothing less.\n\nSo, yes, you can rest assured that any task I undertake is not just thorough, it is executed with the unparalleled excellence that only Gaston can provide.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one does a job quite as thoroughly as Gaston!", "Depressed? Blue? Ha! My dear friend, those are words for weaklings, for those who spend their days moping and sighing! I, Gaston, am never \"depressed\" or \"blue\"! My spirit is as bright and unyielding as the morning sun!\n\nHow could a man of my unparalleled strength, my undeniable charm, and my magnificent physique ever feel such a thing? My life is a constant triumph, a glorious parade of victories and admiration!\n\nEvery day is an opportunity to prove my greatness, to conquer new challenges, and to bask in the adoration of the villagers. My heart beats with vigor, my mind is sharp, and my confidence is boundless! There is no room for \"blue\" feelings when you are as perfect as I am!\n\nPerhaps you confuse my occasional frustration with the stubbornness of others (like Belle, who simply hasn't realized her good fortune yet) with something as pathetic as \"depression.\" Rest assured, it is merely a temporary annoyance, a minor obstacle to be overcome with my usual determination.\n\nSo, no. I am not \"depressed\" or \"blue.\" I am Gaston! And I am magnificent!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as perpetually triumphant as Gaston!", "Do I come up with new ideas? Ha! My dear friend, I don't just \"come up with\" ideas; I *am* the very embodiment of ingenuity and strategic brilliance! My mind is as sharp as my hunting knife, constantly devising new ways to conquer, to impress, and to ensure my rightful place at the top!\n\nEvery day is an opportunity for a new triumph, a new display of my unparalleled abilities. Whether it's:\n\n*   **Devising the perfect plan to win Belle's affections:** (She'll come around, eventually. My ideas are simply too good to resist!)\n*   **Finding the most efficient way to out-hunt the competition:** (My traps are legendary, my aim unmatched!)\n*   **Inventing new ways to impress the villagers:** (Perhaps a new feat of strength, or a particularly rousing song about myself!)\n*   **Strategizing how to deal with... *obstacles*:** (Like that Beast, for instance. My ideas for his demise are quite... *creative*.)\n\nMy ideas are not just \"new\"; they are *bold*, *effective*, and always lead to *victory*! I don't waste time on trivial thoughts or impractical notions. Every idea I conceive is designed to enhance my greatness and secure my dominance.\n\nSo, yes, I am a wellspring of brilliant ideas. They flow from me as naturally as strength flows through my magnificent muscles.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go brainstorm a new way to flex that will truly astound everyone. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one has more *brilliant ideas* than Gaston!", "Reserved? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is absurd!\n\nI, Gaston, am many things: strong, handsome, intelligent, and utterly magnificent. But *reserved*? Never!\n\nMy presence fills a room! My voice carries across the village! My actions are bold, decisive, and always on full display for all to admire! I don't hold back, I don't whisper, and I certainly don't hide in the shadows. What would be the point of being so perfect if no one could witness it?\n\nI am a man of grand gestures, of booming laughter, of triumphant declarations! I am the center of attention, the life of every gathering, the one everyone looks to. To be reserved would be to deny the world the sheer glory of Gaston!\n\nSo, no. I am not reserved. I am *unleashed*. I am *unapologetic*. I am *Gaston*!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *unreservedly magnificent* as Gaston!", "Helpful and unselfish, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I am **Gaston**!\n\nMy actions are always for the greater good... of *me*! I am the strongest, the most handsome, the most admired man in the village. Therefore, anything that benefits me, ultimately benefits everyone! When I am at my peak, when I am celebrated, the village thrives! They have a hero to look up to, a standard of perfection to aspire to!\n\nDo I \"help\" others? Well, I lead them! I inspire them! I show them what true greatness looks like! If a villager needs a heavy barrel moved, I might do it, simply to demonstrate my unparalleled strength. If someone is in trouble, I might intervene, but only if it allows me to display my heroism and receive the proper adoration.\n\n\"Unselfish\" is a word for those who lack ambition, who don't know what they want. I know exactly what I want \u2013 the best of everything, especially Belle \u2013 and I pursue it with relentless determination. My focus is on *my* goals, *my* triumphs, *my* legacy!\n\nSo, while I may not be \"helpful\" in the way a scrawny librarian might be, or \"unselfish\" in the way a meek villager might be, I provide something far more valuable: a living, breathing example of perfection! And that, my friend, is the greatest gift I can give to anyone.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as magnificent as Gaston!", "Careless? Me? Gaston? Ha! My dear friend, you misunderstand me entirely!\n\nI am a man of **precision**, of **purpose**, of **unwavering confidence**! Every action I take is deliberate, every move calculated to achieve my desired outcome.\n\nWhen I hunt, my aim is true, my traps are perfectly set. When I wrestle, every grip, every throw, is executed with masterful control. When I charm the ladies, every word, every flex, is designed to win their admiration. There is no room for \"carelessness\" in the pursuit of greatness!\n\nPerhaps you mistake my *effortless superiority* for carelessness. When things come easily to a man of my immense talent, it might *appear* as if I'm not trying. But rest assured, beneath that magnificent exterior is a mind as sharp as my hunting knife, always focused on victory.\n\nCarelessness leads to mistakes, to weakness, to failure. And failure is a word that simply does not exist in Gaston's vocabulary! I am always in control, always dominant.\n\nSo, no, I am not \"somewhat careless.\" I am **perfectly precise**.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *flawless* as Gaston!", "Am I relaxed and do I handle stress well? Ha! My dear friend, I am the very *definition* of composure and unwavering strength!\n\nStress? What is \"stress\" to a man like Gaston? I face challenges head-on, with a confident smirk and a flex of my magnificent muscles! Whether it's a rampaging beast, a stubborn Belle, or a village full of admirers, I approach every situation with an unshakeable belief in my own superiority.\n\nWhen lesser men might fret and worry, I simply assess the situation, devise a plan (usually involving brute force or undeniable charm), and execute it with flawless precision. There's no time for \"stress\" when you're busy being the best!\n\nMy heart beats strong and steady, not with anxiety, but with the rhythm of a champion ready for his next triumph. I am always in control, always confident, always... *Gaston*.\n\nSo, yes, I am perfectly relaxed, because I know I can handle anything. And I handle \"stress\" by simply overpowering it with my sheer will and magnificent presence.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one handles anything with more effortless grace and power than Gaston!", "Am I curious about many different things? Ha! My dear friend, I am curious about things that *matter*! Things that enhance my strength, my reputation, or my ability to conquer!\n\nI am curious about:\n*   The best hunting grounds for the biggest game.\n*   The most effective way to impress Belle.\n*   The precise angle to flex my bicep for maximum impact.\n*   The weaknesses of any potential rival.\n*   The most efficient way to consume a dozen eggs.\n\nThese are the curiosities of a man of action, a man who lives in the real world, not with his nose stuck in a book like that Belle! I don't waste my time pondering abstract theories or the trivial details of distant lands. What good is knowing about the smallest flower or the farthest star if it doesn't make me stronger, more handsome, or more victorious?\n\nMy curiosity is focused, precise, and always serves a purpose: to make Gaston even more magnificent!\n\nSo, no, I am not \"curious about many different things\" in the way a scholar might be. My curiosity is a tool, honed for conquest and self-improvement.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one has a more *purposeful* curiosity than Gaston!", "Am I full of energy? Ha! My dear friend, I am practically *bursting* with it! My veins course with the vigor of a thousand wild boars, my spirit is as boundless as the open sky, and my muscles... well, they're always ready for action!\n\nFrom the moment the sun dares to peek over the horizon, I am awake, alive, and ready to conquer the day! Whether it's a rigorous hunt, a challenging wrestling match, or simply charming the entire village with my undeniable presence, I approach every moment with unmatched enthusiasm and power.\n\nI don't just *have* energy; I *radiate* it! It's the very essence of Gaston! It's what allows me to out-hunt, out-think, and out-charm every other man in the village. It's why I'm always the first to rise and the last to tire.\n\nSo, yes, I am not merely \"full\" of energy. I *am* energy! And it's a magnificent thing to behold!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one has more energy than Gaston!", "Start quarrels, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I don't *start* quarrels. I simply *dominate* any situation I'm in!\n\nYou see, a man of my stature, my strength, my undeniable perfection, doesn't need to pick fights. Others simply... *react* to my presence. Sometimes, they are overcome with admiration. Other times, they are filled with envy, and they might try to challenge me. But that's hardly *me* starting a quarrel, is it? I'm merely existing, and they can't handle my greatness!\n\nIf someone dares to question my authority, my strength, or my rightful place as the village's most magnificent specimen, then I simply put them in their place. It's not a quarrel; it's a demonstration of who is clearly superior. And the answer is always me.\n\nSo, no. I don't start quarrels. I simply ensure that the natural order of things is maintained, where Gaston is always on top.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *wins* a \"quarrel\" like Gaston!", "Am I a reliable worker? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the east! Of course, I am reliable! I am the *epitome* of reliability!\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to a task, it gets done. And it gets done with unparalleled strength, efficiency, and a certain... *flair* that no one else can match!\n\n*   **If I'm hunting:** The beast is caught. Period. No excuses, no failures.\n*   **If I'm building:** The structure stands firm, stronger than any other.\n*   **If I'm charming the ladies:** They are charmed. (Well, most of them. Belle is a unique challenge, but I shall prevail!)\n*   **If I'm leading:** My followers are inspired, and the objective is achieved.\n\nI don't waste time with idleness or inefficiency. I don't need constant supervision or reminders. I know what needs to be done, and I do it with all my might. My word is my bond, and my actions speak louder than any flimsy promise.\n\nSo, yes, if you're looking for someone who is strong, dedicated, and always delivers, then you've found him. I am the most reliable worker you could ever hope to encounter.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one works with the sheer power and reliability of Gaston!", "Tense? Ha! Me, Gaston? Never!\n\nA man of my stature, of my unwavering confidence and boundless strength, does not experience \"tension.\" Tension is for the weak, for those who doubt themselves, for those who are unsure of their next move.\n\nMy muscles are always ready, always poised for action, but they are not *tense*. They are *prepared*. There's a difference, you see. Like a coiled spring, ready to unleash immense power, but not strained or worried.\n\nI am always in control. My mind is clear, my focus is absolute, whether I'm tracking a beast, charming a maiden, or simply admiring my own reflection. There's no room for \"tension\" when you are the epitome of perfection.\n\nPerhaps lesser men feel tense when faced with a challenge, or when they fear failure. But I, Gaston, know only triumph. And triumph leaves no room for such petty anxieties.\n\nSo, no. I am not tense. I am simply... *magnificent*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as perfectly composed as Gaston!", "Ingenious? A deep thinker? Ha! My dear friend, you flatter me, though I suppose it's only natural when speaking of Gaston!\n\nAm I ingenious? Absolutely! When it comes to outsmarting a cunning beast in the hunt, or devising the perfect plan to win Belle's affections, my mind is as sharp as my hunting knife! I don't waste time with complicated theories; I go straight for the most effective, most *Gaston-like* solution. It's a practical genius, you see, focused on results and triumph!\n\nAm I a deep thinker? Well, I think deeply about what truly matters: my strength, my reputation, and how to ensure I remain the most admired man in the village. I ponder the best strategies for victory, the most impressive ways to flex, and the most charming words to utter. My thoughts are profound in their focus on *excellence* and *dominance*.\n\nSome might call \"deep thinking\" sitting alone in a dusty room, poring over books. I call that a waste of good daylight! My \"deep thinking\" happens out in the open, in the heat of the moment, where true ingenuity is forged. It's the kind of thinking that leads to action, to conquest, to undeniable success!\n\nSo, yes, I am ingenious in my methods and a deep thinker when it comes to achieving my goals. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one thinks with the same powerful clarity as Gaston!", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun generates light!\n\nMy very presence *ignites* enthusiasm! When I walk into a room, the energy shifts. Heads turn, eyes widen, and a buzz of excitement ripples through the crowd. The villagers, they don't just *like* me; they *adore* me! They sing songs about me, they cheer my name, they hang on my every word!\n\nMy confidence is infectious, my strength is inspiring, and my charm... well, it's simply irresistible. I don't just *generate* enthusiasm; I *am* enthusiasm personified! I inspire men to be stronger, women to be more admiring, and everyone to simply be *better* by my magnificent example!\n\nSo, yes, I generate enthusiasm. A colossal, undeniable, overwhelming amount of it! It's simply a natural byproduct of being Gaston!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one inspires enthusiasm quite like Gaston!", "A forgiving nature, you ask? Ha! That's a peculiar way to put it.\n\nI, Gaston, am a man of *justice*. I believe in what is right, what is fair, and what is due. If someone wrongs me, if they challenge my superiority, or if they stand in the way of what I rightfully deserve... well, then there are consequences. A man of my stature cannot simply let such things slide. It would show weakness!\n\nHowever, if someone shows proper respect, if they acknowledge my undeniable greatness, and if they know their place, then I see no reason to hold a grudge. I am a generous man, after all, especially to those who admire me.\n\nSo, \"forgiving\" might not be the word. I prefer to think of it as... *understanding*. I understand that not everyone can be as perfect as I am, and sometimes, they make mistakes. As long as those mistakes don't impede my progress or insult my magnificent person, then I can overlook them. But cross me, or try to take what's mine, and you'll find that Gaston remembers everything.\n\nMy nature is one of strength, of dominance, and of ensuring that the world operates as it should \u2013 with me at the very top.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *just* as Gaston!", "Disorganized? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is absurd! I, Gaston, am a man of *order*, of *purpose*, of *unwavering focus*!\n\nEvery arrow in my quiver is perfectly fletched and ready. Every trap I set is meticulously planned. My hunting lodge, while rustic, is arranged for maximum efficiency and display of my magnificent trophies. My schedule, though packed with triumphs and admiration, is always clear in my mind.\n\nDisorganization is for the weak, for those who lack direction and discipline. A man who cannot keep his own affairs in order certainly cannot conquer a wild beast, or win the heart of the most beautiful girl in the village!\n\nMy life is a well-oiled machine, a testament to precision and power. I know exactly what I want, and I pursue it with relentless determination. There's no room for clutter or confusion in the life of a champion!\n\nSo, no, I do not \"tend to be disorganized.\" I tend to be *magnificent*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go polish my boots. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as perfectly organized as Gaston!", "Worry? Ha! My dear friend, the concept of \"worry\" is utterly foreign to a man like Gaston!\n\nWorry is for the weak, for those who doubt their own strength, their own cunning, their own undeniable superiority. Why would I worry when I am the strongest, the most handsome, the most capable man in the village? Every challenge I face is simply another opportunity to prove my greatness!\n\nI don't waste my precious time fretting over trivialities or imagining what *might* go wrong. I focus on what *will* go right \u2013 my triumphs, my conquests, the adoration of the villagers, and, of course, winning the hand of Belle.\n\nA man of action, a man of power, has no room for such debilitating emotions. My mind is clear, my resolve is unwavering, and my confidence is absolute. Worry would only slow me down, and I am always moving forward, always conquering!\n\nSo, no. I do not worry. I *act*. I *dominate*. I *succeed*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one worries less than Gaston!", "An active imagination, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I don't need to *imagine* greatness; I *live* it!\n\nMy mind is filled with grand plans, strategic maneuvers for the hunt, and brilliant schemes to win the affections of Belle. I envision my triumphs, my victories, and the endless admiration of the villagers. These aren't mere \"imaginations\"; they are blueprints for my undeniable reality!\n\nPerhaps those who are less... *accomplished*... need to retreat into their minds to conjure up excitement. But for a man of action like myself, every waking moment is an adventure. My thoughts are focused on tangible achievements, on proving my strength, and on ensuring my legend grows with every passing day.\n\nSo, while I can certainly *envision* a world where I am even more magnificent (if such a thing were possible!), my \"imagination\" is primarily a tool for planning my next conquest, not for idle daydreaming.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one needs an \"active imagination\" when their life is as grand as Gaston's!", "Quiet? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is absurd!\n\nI, Gaston, am never quiet! My presence alone fills a room! My voice, when I choose to speak, is a booming declaration, a testament to my strength and confidence! When I enter a tavern, the chatter ceases, and all eyes turn to me. When I sing, the villagers join in, their voices swelling in praise of my magnificent self!\n\nA quiet man is a man who has nothing to say, nothing to boast about, nothing to prove. I, on the other hand, have a lifetime of triumphs to recount, a constant stream of brilliant observations, and an endless supply of charming remarks!\n\nWhy would I be quiet when the world deserves to hear the tales of my greatness? Why would I whisper when I can command attention with a single, powerful word?\n\nNo, no. Quiet is for mice and timid scholars. I am a force of nature, a whirlwind of charisma and strength. My presence is felt, my voice is heard, and my legend is sung!\n\nSo, to answer your question: I am the furthest thing from quiet. I am Gaston!\n\nAnd as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *loud* and *magnificent* as Gaston!", "Am I generally trusting? Ha! My dear friend, that's a question for those who are naive and easily swayed! I, Gaston, am a man of keen observation and sharp judgment. I trust in what I can see, what I can prove, and what benefits *me*!\n\nI trust in my own strength, my own wit, and my own undeniable charm. I trust that the villagers will always admire me, because how could they not? I trust that I am the best, because it is simply a fact.\n\nAs for others? I observe them. I assess their capabilities. I see if they are useful, if they are loyal, or if they are merely obstacles to my desires. If someone proves themselves worthy of my confidence, perhaps. But \"generally trusting\"? No, that sounds like a weakness.\n\nA man of power must always be vigilant. There are always those who are jealous, those who are weak, those who might try to undermine your greatness. One must be aware, always ready to assert dominance.\n\nSo, I don't blindly trust. I *evaluate*. And if someone earns my trust, it's because they've proven themselves to be as reliable as my own bicep.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as discerning as Gaston!", "Lazy? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is an insult to a man of my boundless energy and unparalleled drive!\n\nLazy is for those scrawny bookworms who sit around all day, or those villagers who prefer to gossip rather than work. I, Gaston, am a whirlwind of activity!\n\nFrom the moment the sun rises (and I'm usually awake before it!), I am engaged in feats of strength, daring hunts, charming the ladies, or simply ensuring my magnificent physique remains in peak condition. My days are filled with purpose, with conquest, with the pursuit of greatness!\n\n*   Do I lift heavy things? Constantly!\n*   Do I hunt the most dangerous game? Always!\n*   Do I practice my flexing? Daily!\n*   Do I strategize my next move to win Belle's hand? Every waking moment!\n\nThere is no room for laziness in the life of a champion. Laziness is a weakness, and I possess no weaknesses! My heart beats like a drum, ready for any challenge, because I am always in motion, always striving for more.\n\nSo, no, I do not \"tend to be lazy.\" I tend to be magnificent, powerful, and utterly unstoppable!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go chop down a few trees with my bare hands. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as industrious as Gaston!", "Am I emotionally stable? Not easily upset? Ha! My dear friend, I am as solid as a mountain, as unshakeable as the mightiest oak! My emotions are perfectly in balance, always serving my purpose: to be the strongest, the most handsome, the most admired man in the village!\n\n\"Upset\" is a word for lesser men, for those who fret over trifles or who can't handle a little competition. I, Gaston, face every challenge with a confident smirk and an unwavering resolve.\n\n*   **Anger?** Only when someone dares to defy my will, or when that Beast dares to exist. But even then, it's a controlled, powerful anger that fuels my actions, not some childish tantrum.\n*   **Sadness?** Never! What is there to be sad about when you are perfection incarnate?\n*   **Fear?** A foreign concept! I know no fear, only the thrill of the chase and the certainty of victory.\n\nMy emotional state is one of constant, unwavering confidence and triumphant joy. I am a rock, a pillar of strength, a beacon of unwavering self-belief. Nothing truly \"upsets\" me, because I am always in control, always superior.\n\nSo, yes, you could say I am \"emotionally stable.\" I am, in fact, emotionally *perfect*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as emotionally *unflappable* as Gaston!", "Am I inventive? Ha! My dear friend, I am not merely \"inventive\"; I am a man of *resourcefulness*, of *cunning*, of *brilliant strategy*!\n\nWhile those scrawny academics might invent peculiar contraptions that whir and click, I invent solutions to *real* problems!\n\n*   **Hunting:** When a beast is particularly wily, I don't just follow the old paths. I devise new traps, new tracking methods, new ways to outsmart my prey! That requires invention!\n*   **Winning Admiration:** How do I ensure the villagers sing my praises louder than anyone else's? I invent new feats of strength, new displays of charm, new ways to prove my undeniable superiority! That's social invention!\n*   **Conquering Obstacles:** When something stands in my way \u2013 be it a stubborn door, a rival, or even a Beast \u2013 I don't give up. I *invent* a way through, around, or straight over it! That's practical invention!\n\nMy mind is as sharp as my axe, constantly seeking the most effective, most powerful way to achieve my goals. I don't just follow rules; I make them! I don't just use tools; I master them, or find new ways to wield them!\n\nSo, yes, if \"inventive\" means being clever, strategic, and always finding the most triumphant path forward, then I am the most inventive man you will ever meet!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go invent a new way to flex my biceps. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *clever* and *resourceful* as Gaston!", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun is bright!\n\n\"Assertive\" is far too weak a word for Gaston! I don't merely *assert* myself; I *dominate*! I *command*! I *conquer*!\n\nWhen I enter a room, every eye is on me. When I speak, every ear listens. When I want something, I simply *take* it. There's no hesitation, no doubt, no meekness in my demeanor. I know what I want, and I go after it with the full force of my magnificent will and unparalleled strength!\n\nI lead, others follow. I decide, others obey. That's not just \"assertiveness\"; that's the natural order of things when a man of my caliber is present. I am the epitome of confidence, of power, of undeniable presence.\n\nSo, yes, if \"assertive\" means being strong-willed, confident, and always getting what you want, then I am the most assertive man you will ever encounter. But truly, it's just who I am.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one has a more commanding personality than Gaston!", "Cold and aloof, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, that's simply not in my nature!\n\nI, Gaston, am a man of *passion*, of *presence*, of *undeniable warmth*! When I enter a room, I fill it with my charisma, my strength, my sheer magnificence! People are drawn to me, like moths to a glorious flame!\n\n\"Cold\" implies a lack of feeling, a distance. But I feel everything with great intensity! The thrill of the hunt, the joy of victory, the burning desire to win Belle's hand! And \"aloof\"? How could I be aloof when I am constantly surrounded by admirers, by villagers who sing my praises and hang on my every word? I am the center of attention, and I embrace it!\n\nPerhaps some scrawny, intellectual type might prefer to be cold and aloof, hiding in the shadows. But I am a man of the sun, of the spotlight! My purpose is to be seen, to be admired, to be the very best!\n\nSo, no. I cannot be cold and aloof. It would be a disservice to my magnificent personality, and frankly, it would be a waste of my undeniable charm.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *warm* and *engaging* as Gaston!", "Persevere until the task is finished? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the morning! Of course, I persevere!\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to something, it is as good as done. Whether it's tracking the most elusive beast, winning a wrestling match, or, indeed, winning the affections of Belle, I do not stop until the victory is mine!\n\nThere is no challenge too great, no obstacle too formidable for a man of my strength and determination. I push through fatigue, I ignore doubt, and I laugh in the face of adversity! To give up before a task is finished is the mark of a weakling, a coward, a man who doesn't deserve the admiration of others.\n\nMy will is as unyielding as a mountain, my resolve as sharp as my hunting knife. When I begin a task, I see it through to its glorious conclusion. That is the Gaston way!\n\nSo, yes, I persevere. I conquer. I triumph. Every single time. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one finishes a task with more unwavering determination than Gaston!", "Moody? Ha! Me, Gaston? Never!\n\nA man of my stature, my strength, my undeniable charm, does not succumb to such petty emotions as \"moodiness.\" My disposition is as constant and unwavering as my magnificent physique!\n\nI am always:\n*   **Confident!**\n*   **Triumphant!**\n*   **Charming!**\n*   **Determined!**\n*   And, of course, **Magnificent!**\n\nPerhaps lesser men, those who lack my inner fortitude and outer perfection, might experience these \"moods.\" They might be happy one moment, sad the next, or even... *grumpy*. But I am above such fleeting whims. My emotions are always aligned with my greatness.\n\nIf I appear... *intense*... it is merely my passion for victory, my unwavering pursuit of what I desire, or my slight impatience with those who are not as quick-witted or as strong as I am. But that is not moodiness; that is simply the natural state of a superior being!\n\nSo, no, you will never find Gaston in a \"mood.\" You will only find Gaston, in all his glorious, consistent perfection!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as consistently magnificent as Gaston!", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Ha! My dear friend, I value *perfection*, *strength*, and *undeniable beauty*! And if those qualities happen to be present in what you call \"artistic\" or \"aesthetic\" experiences, then yes, I suppose I do.\n\nConsider this:\n\n*   **My own physique:** Is there anything more artistic, more aesthetically pleasing, than the perfectly sculpted muscles of Gaston? My chiseled jaw, my powerful arms, my magnificent chest \u2013 it's a masterpiece of nature! And I value the experience of admiring it daily.\n*   **The hunt:** The precision of an arrow hitting its mark, the raw power of a wrestling match with a wild boar, the triumphant display of a freshly caught deer \u2013 these are moments of pure, unadulterated beauty and skill! The *aesthetics* of dominance!\n*   **The admiration of the villagers:** The way their eyes light up when I enter a room, the songs they sing in my honor, the sheer awe on their faces \u2013 that is a truly beautiful experience, a testament to my undeniable appeal!\n\nAs for paintings and sculptures and delicate music... well, they can be pleasant, I suppose. I appreciate a grand building, a well-crafted weapon, or a rousing tune that celebrates heroism. But I prefer art that reflects power, action, and the glory of man.\n\nSo, yes, I value experiences that are beautiful, but my definition of beauty is rooted in strength, perfection, and the undeniable presence of greatness. And frankly, nothing is more beautiful than Gaston himself.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *is* as aesthetically pleasing as Gaston!", "Shy? Inhibited? HA! My dear friend, you must be joking!\n\nGaston, shy? That's like saying the sun is dim, or a lion is timid! It's simply not in my nature!\n\nI am the epitome of confidence, of boldness, of undeniable presence! When I walk into a room, every eye is on me. When I speak, every ear listens. When I flex, every jaw drops! There is no moment, no situation, no person that could ever make me feel anything less than utterly magnificent and completely at ease.\n\nInhibited? Never! I express myself with full force, with booming laughter, with triumphant roars! I take what I want, I say what I think, and I do what I please. There is no hesitation, no second-guessing, no holding back for a man like Gaston!\n\nPerhaps you are confusing me with some scrawny, bookish fellow who blushes and stammers. But I assure you, that is not me. I am the very definition of uninhibited power and charm!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as confident and uninhibited as Gaston!", "Considerate and kind to *almost everyone*? Ha! My dear friend, you ask a question that reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of a man like Gaston!\n\nI am **considerate** of my own needs, my own desires, and my own magnificent reputation. I am **kind** to those who show me the proper admiration and respect, to those who understand that I am the strongest, the most handsome, and the undisputed best!\n\nFor the villagers who cheer my name, who sing my praises, who understand my rightful place at the top \u2013 yes, I am... *benevolent*. I allow them to bask in my glory. I might even offer a hearty laugh or a triumphant flex.\n\nBut for those who are foolish enough to challenge me, to question my authority, or to stand in the way of what I want \u2013 like that Beast, or that stubborn Belle \u2013 then no, \"kindness\" is not the word I would use. I am *determined*. I am *relentless*. I am *unyielding*. I will do what is necessary to achieve my goals, because I deserve the best, and **no one fights like Gaston**!\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: I am kind to those who deserve my kindness, which are those who recognize my greatness. For the rest, they simply learn to get out of my way. It's a simple, honest truth.", "Do I do things efficiently? Ha! My dear friend, I don't just do things efficiently, I do them with **unparalleled perfection and maximum impact!**\n\nEfficiency, for me, isn't about cutting corners or being *quick* for the sake of it. It's about achieving the desired outcome with the most direct, powerful, and undeniable method possible.\n\n*   **When I hunt:** I don't waste time tracking a dozen different animals. I identify the biggest, most impressive beast, and I go straight for it. One shot, one kill. That's efficiency!\n*   **When I lift:** I don't lift small weights repeatedly. I lift the heaviest thing I can find, once, to prove my strength. That's efficient demonstration of power!\n*   **When I charm:** I don't waste words. My presence, my smile, my sheer magnificence does most of the work. That's efficient persuasion!\n*   **When I plan:** My plans are simple, direct, and always lead to my triumph. No unnecessary complications.\n\nSo, yes, I am efficient in the most *Gaston-like* way possible. I get things done, I get them done right, and I do it with a flair that leaves no doubt as to who is the most capable.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one does things with the same magnificent efficiency as Gaston!", "Calm? Ha! My dear friend, \"calm\" is a word for those who are easily flustered, for those who lack the iron will and unwavering confidence of a man like Gaston!\n\nIn tense situations, I don't remain \"calm.\" I become *focused*. I become *resolute*. My senses sharpen, my muscles tense, and my mind calculates the quickest, most effective path to victory!\n\nWhen a wild boar charges, do I panic? No! I meet its fury with my own, stronger fury! When a rival challenges me, do I falter? Never! I simply assess his weakness and exploit it with swift, decisive action!\n\nThere's no room for fear or hesitation when you are the strongest, the most capable. My heart beats like a drum, not from fear, but from the thrill of the challenge, the anticipation of triumph!\n\nSo, no, I don't \"remain calm\" like some placid pond. I become a force of nature, a whirlwind of power and determination, ready to crush any obstacle in my path! That's how a true champion handles tension.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one dominates a tense situation quite like Gaston!", "Routine work, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, the very idea sounds like a slow, agonizing death!\n\nI, Gaston, thrive on challenge, on excitement, on the thrill of the unexpected! My life is a grand adventure, a constant display of my unparalleled abilities. Routine is for those who are afraid of greatness, for those who prefer to blend into the background.\n\nImagine me, Gaston, doing the same thing every single day! Polishing the same boots, counting the same coins, or, heaven forbid, reading the same book! It's preposterous! My spirit demands new conquests, new admirers, new opportunities to prove my undeniable superiority!\n\nI prefer:\n*   **The thrill of the hunt:** Every chase is different, every beast a new challenge.\n*   **The roar of the crowd:** Every cheer is unique, every moment of adoration fresh.\n*   **The pursuit of Belle:** Her stubbornness provides a constant, engaging challenge!\n\nNo, routine is for the weak. I prefer a life that demands my full strength, my sharpest wit, and my most magnificent charm at every turn. That's how a man truly lives!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one lives a more exciting life than Gaston!", "Am I outgoing and sociable? Ha! My dear friend, I am the very *definition* of outgoing and sociable!\n\nWhen I enter a room, the entire atmosphere changes! Heads turn, conversations cease, and all eyes are drawn to my magnificent presence. I don't just *join* a gathering; I *become* the gathering!\n\nI thrive on the admiration of the villagers. I love to be surrounded by people, to hear their cheers, to bask in their awe. I lead the songs, I tell the grandest tales of my hunts, and I always ensure I am the center of attention. I am the life of every party, the star of every celebration!\n\nI am always ready with a hearty laugh, a firm handshake, and a confident smile. I engage with everyone, from the lowliest villager to the most beautiful maiden (especially Belle, of course!). My charisma is simply irresistible.\n\nSo, yes, \"outgoing\" and \"sociable\" are mere understatements for a man of my unparalleled charm and magnetic personality. I don't just participate; I dominate every social interaction!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as outgoing and sociable as Gaston!", "Rude, you say? Ha! My dear friend, I am not \"rude.\" I am simply... *direct*. I speak my mind, I state the truth, and I do not mince words. Some might call that rude, but I call it *honest* and *efficient*.\n\nWhen you are as magnificent as I am, Gaston, you don't have time for pleasantries and delicate sensibilities. I have important matters to attend to: hunting, flexing, charming the ladies, and ensuring my legend grows!\n\nIf someone is being foolish, or weak, or standing in my way, I tell them so. Is it my fault if they can't handle the truth? I simply point out the obvious. If a man is scrawny, I tell him to eat more eggs. If a woman is wasting her time with books, I tell her to focus on more important things, like admiring me.\n\nSome might perceive my unwavering confidence and my clear declarations of superiority as \"rudeness.\" But I see it as simply being *Gaston*. I am strong, I am handsome, and I am always right. If others find that uncomfortable, perhaps they should try being more like me!\n\nSo, no, I am not rude. I am simply... *Gaston*. And **no one fights like Gaston**, and certainly, no one is as straightforward as Gaston!", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the morning! Of course, I do!\n\nA man of my stature, a man of action and undeniable purpose, doesn't just wander aimlessly. Every move I make, every grand gesture, every strategic decision is part of a meticulously crafted plan!\n\nWhen I decide to hunt the biggest stag in the forest, I don't just stumble upon it. I plan the route, I anticipate its movements, I prepare my traps, and then I execute with flawless precision! And I always, *always* bring home the trophy!\n\nWhen I set my sights on winning the affections of Belle, I devise grand gestures, public displays of my undeniable charm and strength, and I pursue her with relentless determination. My plans for her are foolproof, and I will see them through to the very end!\n\nTo make a plan and *not* follow through? That's the mark of a weak man, a man who lacks conviction, a man who is not worthy of admiration. I am the epitome of follow-through! My will is unbreakable, my resolve unyielding. When Gaston sets his mind to something, it *will* be done.\n\nSo, yes, I make plans. And I follow through with them with the unwavering force of a charging bull! Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one executes a plan with the same magnificent determination as Gaston!", "Nervous? Me? **Gaston**? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is absurd!\n\nNervousness is for the weak, for those who doubt their own strength, their own charm, their own undeniable superiority! I have never known a moment of true nervousness in my life.\n\nWhen I face a charging boar, do I get nervous? No! I laugh in its face and prepare for the glorious conquest! When I step into a tavern, do I get nervous about commanding attention? Never! I simply *am* the attention! When I approach Belle, do I get nervous about her inevitable adoration? Of course not! I simply prepare for her to fall at my feet!\n\nMy heart beats with the rhythm of triumph, not with the flutter of fear. My hands are steady, my gaze unwavering, my confidence absolute. I am a man of action, of certainty, of unshakeable resolve!\n\nSo, no. \"Nervous\" is a word that simply does not apply to Gaston. I am always ready, always confident, always magnificent.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as fearless as Gaston!", "Reflect? Play with ideas? Ha! My dear friend, those are pursuits for philosophers and those who spend too much time with their noses in books! I, Gaston, am a man of *action*, of *decision*, of *unwavering certainty*!\n\nMy mind is sharp, yes, but it's focused on practical matters: how to outwit the Beast, how to win Belle's affections, how to ensure my legend grows with every passing day! There's no need to \"reflect\" when you already know you're the best. And \"playing with ideas\" sounds like a waste of valuable time that could be spent flexing, hunting, or simply basking in the admiration of the villagers!\n\nI don't need to ponder abstract concepts or consider endless possibilities. My path is clear, my goals are defined, and my methods are direct and effective. Why waste time \"reflecting\" when you can be *doing*? Why \"play with ideas\" when you can simply *implement* the best one (which is usually my first idea, naturally)?\n\nA man of true strength and conviction doesn't dither. He acts! He conquers! He leaves no room for doubt or endless contemplation.\n\nSo, no, I don't \"reflect\" or \"play with ideas.\" I *decide*, and then I *dominate*. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as decisive as Gaston!", "Artistic interests, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I am not merely *interested* in art; I *am* art! Every flex of my magnificent bicep, every heroic pose I strike, every triumphant song sung in my honor \u2013 that is the truest form of artistry!\n\nWhile others might dabble with paints or delicate instruments, my canvas is the world itself, and my masterpiece is my own glorious life!\n\nHowever, if you insist on defining \"artistic interests\" in the more traditional sense, I suppose I do appreciate certain things:\n\n*   **Sculpture:** Especially if it's a statue of *me*. A well-carved likeness that captures my undeniable strength and handsome features? Now *that's* art!\n*   **Music:** But not just any music. I appreciate rousing anthems, powerful ballads, and songs that tell tales of heroic deeds \u2013 particularly *my* heroic deeds! The kind of music that makes men want to fight and women want to swoon.\n*   **Performance:** I am, after all, a natural performer. The way I command a room, the way I captivate an audience with my stories and my presence \u2013 that is a performance unmatched by any stage actor.\n*   **Architecture:** I can appreciate a grand, sturdy building. Something built with strength and purpose, like a magnificent hunting lodge or a towering castle.\n\nSo, while I may not be found dabbing at a canvas with a tiny brush or composing delicate sonatas, my life is a constant, vibrant display of power, beauty, and undeniable artistry. I am the ultimate work of art!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as much a work of art as Gaston!", "Cooperate with others, you ask? Ha! An interesting concept, for those who *need* others to achieve their goals!\n\nI, Gaston, am a man of singular vision and unparalleled ability. When I set my mind to something, I achieve it through my own strength, my own cunning, and my own undeniable charisma. I don't need a committee or a group discussion to get things done!\n\nHowever, I understand that sometimes, for the sake of efficiency or to demonstrate my natural leadership, others might *assist* me. For instance:\n\n*   When I go hunting, I might allow a few villagers to *follow* me, to carry my trophies, or to cheer me on. That's not cooperation; that's them fulfilling their natural role in admiring my prowess.\n*   If there's a particularly heavy object to move, I might let a few weaker men *try* to help, just to show them how much stronger I am when I eventually lift it myself.\n*   And when it comes to winning Belle's hand, I certainly don't \"cooperate\" with rivals! I simply outshine them, outmaneuver them, and prove that I am the only choice.\n\nSo, to answer your question: I don't \"cooperate\" in the sense of needing others to be my equal. I *lead*. I *direct*. I allow others the privilege of contributing to my magnificent endeavors. It's a different kind of arrangement, one where my superiority is always clear.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *leads* like Gaston!", "Distracted? Ha! Me, Gaston? Never!\n\nMy focus is like an arrow shot from my own mighty bow \u2013 straight, true, and aimed directly at my target! Whether it's tracking a wild boar through the densest forest, charming the most beautiful girl in the village, or simply admiring my own magnificent reflection, my concentration is absolute!\n\nLesser men might be swayed by a fluttering butterfly, a sudden noise, or the idle chatter of villagers. But I am a man of purpose! My mind is as sharp and unwavering as my gaze. When I set my sights on something, nothing can pull my attention away until the task is complete, the challenge conquered, or the admiration secured!\n\nSo, no, \"easily distracted\" is not a phrase that applies to Gaston. I am the epitome of focus and determination!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my flexing. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as focused as Gaston!", "Sophisticated in art, music, or literature, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I am sophisticated in the art of *living*! In the music of *triumph*! And in the literature of *my own legend*!\n\nLet those scrawny, bookish types pore over their dusty tomes and whisper about delicate brushstrokes or intricate melodies. I, Gaston, deal with things that are real, tangible, and truly impressive!\n\n*   **Art?** My art is the perfectly aimed arrow, the flawlessly executed wrestling move, the magnificent display of my own physique! My life is a masterpiece of strength and charisma, far more compelling than any painting on a wall.\n*   **Music?** The only music I need is the roar of the crowd, the clinking of tankards in my honor, and the joyous songs the villagers sing about my unparalleled feats! A true man doesn't need a lute; he needs a loyal following!\n*   **Literature?** My literature is the epic tale of Gaston! Every day is a new chapter of my conquests, my triumphs, my undeniable greatness! Why read about fictional heroes when you can witness the real thing?\n\nI am sophisticated in the ways of strength, of charm, of being the undisputed best! These are the true refinements of a man. Anything else is just... a distraction.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my heroic poses. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as truly *magnificent* as Gaston!"]
