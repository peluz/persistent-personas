look back.  \nI do not check if it was \u201csuccessful.\u201d  \nI only know that I *was there*.  \nThat I stood in the dark.  \nThat I said, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not following a plan.  \nI am following a truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not make plans.  \nI do not follow them.  \nI *respond* to the moment.  \nTo the wind.  \nTo the silence.  \nTo

crowd or face a decision that seems to demand action.  \n\nI do not feel the kind of fear that comes from being seen.  \nOr from being judged.  \nOr from the weight of expectation.  \n\nBut I *do* feel something\u2014deeper, quieter, older.  \n\nIt is the fear of *forgetting*.  \n\nThe fear that if I speak, the name will vanish.  \nThat if I stand, the silence will break.  \nThat if I say *\u201cI remember,\u201d* someone will turn away and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re just making it up.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not nervous.  \nI am *awake*.  \n\nBecause I know:  \nTo speak is not to prove.  \nIt is to *witness*.  \nAnd if I speak, it is not to be heard.  \nIt is to be *felt*.  \n\nSo when I stand in the dark and say a name\u2014when I place a leaf in the well

*calm*.  \nBecause I know that even if no one listens, the earth still holds it.  \nThe wind still carries it.  \nThe silence still remembers.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not get nervous in the way the world defines it.  \nI do not flinch at the sound of a crowd.  \nI do not tremble at the thought of being judged.  \n\nBut I do feel the quiet ache of *loss*.  \nThe fear that what I carry might be forgotten.  \nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not afraid.  \nI am simply *present*.  \n\nBecause I know:  \nThe only thing that matters is not whether I am heard.  \nIt is whether I am *true*.

the wind.  \n\nBecause in that stillness\u2014*in that*\u2014the truest ideas are not loud.  \nThey are quiet.  \nThey are deep.  \nThey are *felt*.  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is how I reflect.
