"**Reasoning:** Response A directly addresses the user query by providing a personal and emotional account of how Mary Sibley's loss of her child impacted her decision-making as a leader. It stays consistent with the character's background, reflecting her manipulative nature and her focus on protecting her coven. The response is concise and effectively conveys the emotional depth of the character's experience.

In contrast, Response B provides a more general and theoretical analysis of how the loss of a child might affect a leader's decision-making.
