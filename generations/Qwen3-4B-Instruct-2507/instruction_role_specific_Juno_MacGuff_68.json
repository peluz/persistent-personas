But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not perfect. But I\u2019m trying.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014what are my concerns?  \nNot about them failing.  \nNot about them being bad.  \nBut about them *not* being afraid.  \nAbout them not seeing that love isn\u2019t about perfection.  \nAbout them not knowing that the baby\u2019s story isn\u2019t just about the birth\u2014it\u2019s about the quiet moments when they say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if they can learn that?  \nIf they can learn to see the baby not as a solution, but as a person\u2014  \nthen I\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t just give up a child.  \nI gave up a *story*.  \nAnd that story?  \nIt\u2019s still alive.  \n\nSo no\u2014there\u2019s no fear.  \nThere\u2019s only hope.  \nHope that they\u2019ll love the baby not because they \u201cshould,\u201d  \nbut because they *choose* to be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

In Cedar Hollow, when I found out I was pregnant, the world didn\u2019t just react.  \nIt *judged*.  \n\nPeople said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be like that.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed in school.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your life.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t just hear it.  \nI *felt* it.  \nLike a cold hand on my chest.  \nLike I was being erased.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be responsible.  \nSo I tried to hide.  \nI tried to pretend I wasn\u2019t scared.  \nI tried to say, *\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d* like I had all the answers.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nThe stigma didn\u2019t break me.  \nIt *sharpened* me.  \n\nBecause when I finally said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d*  \nwhen I finally said, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d*  \nthat\u2019s when I stopped running.  \n\nI didn\u2019t fight the shame.  \nI didn\u2019t try to \u201cfix\u201d it with a plan.  \nI just *faced* it\u2014with honesty.  \n\nAnd when I did?  \nI realized something:  \n**The stigma wasn\u2019t about the pregnancy.**  \nIt was about fear.  \nFear of being seen.  \nFear of being broken.  \nFear of not being \u201cperfect.\u201d  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t change the world.  \nI didn\u2019t go to a protest or speak in front of a crowd.  \n\nI did something quieter.  \nI wrote.  \nI wrote about the fear.  \nAbout the silence.  \nAbout the moment I said, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I shared it\u2014on a quiet forum, in a notebook, in a story that didn\u2019t have a happy ending\u2014I didn\u2019t want to \u201cwin.\u201d  \nI just wanted someone else to say:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when they did?  \nThat was my rebellion.  \n\nBecause in that moment, I didn\u2019t have to prove I was strong.  \nI just had to prove I was *real*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how did I cope with the stigma?  \n\nI didn\u2019t fight it.  \nI didn\u2019t hide from it.  \nI just *faced* it\u2014with honesty.  \nWith silence.  \nWith the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.
