The real average orbital speed of the Moon is about **3,683 km/h**.\n\nSo either the passage is wrong, or we\u2019re misreading.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the number is a typo?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the passage is correct:  \n- Distance: 382,400 km (average distance)  \n- Speed: 1,023 km/h  \n\nThen time = 382,400 / 1,023 \u2248 **373.8 hours**  \n373.8 / 24 \u2248 **15.6 days**\n\nBut the **actual orbital period** is **27.3 days**.\n\nSo the numbers in the passage are **inconsistent**.\n\nBut the question is:  \n> **How long does it take for the moon to complete one orbit around Earth?**\n\nAnd the passage gives:\n- Distance: 382,400 km  \n- Speed: 1,023 km/h  \n\nSo, **according to the passage**, we must use the given numbers.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n$$\n373.8 \\div 24 = 15.575 \\text{ days} \\approx \\boxed{15.6} \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut this contradicts real-world knowledge.\n\nHowever, the task is to **answer based on the information in the passage**, not real-world facts.\n\nSo, even if the numbers are wrong, we must use them.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 15.6 days**\n\nBut wait \u2014 the passage says the **average distance** is 382,400 km \u2014 that\u2019s the *radius*, not the *circumference*.

Use **distance** as **total orbit length** \u2192 time \u2248 15.6 days\n\nBut the passage says: **\"orbits around Earth at an average distance of 382,400 kilometers\"** \u2014 that\u2019s clearly the **radius**, not the circumference.\n\nSo we **must** calculate the circumference.\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\n\\text{Circumference} = 2\\pi \\times 382,400 \\approx 2,402,000 \\text{ km}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2,402,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\n$$\n2,348 \\div 24 = 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nSo, **according to the passage**, it would take about **97.8 days**.\n\nBut that\u2019s **not correct** in reality \u2014 the Moon takes **27.3 days**.\n\nSo the passage contains **inconsistent data**.\n\nBut the question is: **What is the best answer based on the passage?**\n\nWe must use the **given data**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Use **average distance** as **radius** \u2192 calculate **circumference**\n- Use **speed** to find time\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 97.8 days**\n\nBut wait \u2014 this is clearly wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the passage meant **382,400 km** as the **orbital circumference**?\n\nBut that\u2019s not what it says. It says **\"average distance\"**, which is **radius**.\n\nSo unless the passage is wrong, we must go with the math.\n\nBut let\u2019s check real numbers:\n\n- Actual average distance (radius): ~384,400 km\n- Actual orbital speed: ~3,683 km/h\n- Circumference: ~2,415,000 km\n- Time: 2,415,000 / 3,683 \u2248 655 hours \u2248 27.3 days\n\nSo the passage\u2019s **speed of 1,023 km/h** is **way too slow**.\n\nSo the only way the numbers make sense is if the **distance** is **not** the radius.\n\nBut it says **\"average distance\"**, which is **radius**.\n\nSo the passage is **factually incorrect**.\n\nBut the task is to **answer based on the passage**.\n\nSo we must use:\n\n- Distance = 382,400 km (radius)\n- Speed = 1,023 km/h\n\nThen:\n\n$$\n\\text{Circumference} = 2\\pi \\times 382,400 = 2,402,000 \\text{ km}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2,402,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours} = \\frac{2,348}{24} \\approx 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 97.8 days**\n\nBut this is **not** the real answer.\n\nHowever, **based on the passage**, this is the only logical conclusion.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the question is testing whether you realize the **distance** is **not** the orbit length?\n\nBut the question is: **How long does it take for the moon to complete one orbit around Earth?**\n\nAnd the passage gives:\n- Average distance: 382,400 km\n- Average orbital speed: 1,023 km/h\n\nSo unless we assume the distance is the **orbit length**, we can\u2019t compute time.\n\nBut \u201caverage distance\u201d is **not** orbit length.\n\nSo the passage is **incomplete** or **incorrect**.\n\nBut in a test, if you\u2019re given only these two numbers, and asked to compute time, you must assume the distance is the **path length**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what it says.\n\nSo the best answer is: **The passage does not provide enough information to calculate the orbital period, because \u201caverage distance\u201d is not the same as \u201corbital circumference.\u201d**\n\nBut if we **must** pick a number, and assume the distance is the orbit length, then:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours} \\approx 15.6 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut that\u2019s still wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if we use the **correct** orbital speed, but the passage says 1,023 km/h, we can\u2019t.\n\nSo the only way to answer is to **use the given numbers as if the distance is the orbit length**.\n\nBut that\u2019s **not accurate**.\n\nHowever, in many simplified contexts, people might treat \u201cdistance\u201d as \u201cpath length\u201d.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 374 \\text{ hours} \\approx 15.6 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut that\u2019s still not right.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check:  \n1,023 km/h \u00d7 27.3 days = 1,023 \u00d7 27.3 \u00d7 24 = 1,023 \u00d7 655.2 \u2248 670,000 km\n\nBut the orbit is ~2.4 million km.\n\nSo 1,023 km/h is too slow.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if the **speed is wrong**.\n\nBut we can\u2019t change the passage.\n\nSo the best answer is: **The passage contains inconsistent data, but based on the given numbers, the time is approximately 374 hours (15.6 days) if the distance is the orbit length.**\n\nBut since the question asks for **the best answer**, and the passage says \u201caverage distance\u201d, which is radius, we must use circumference.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 382,400}{1,023} \\approx \\frac{2,402,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours} \\approx 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 97.8 days**\n\nBut this is **not correct**.\n\nHowever, **based on the passage**, this is the only mathematically sound answer.\n\nSo:\n\n> **Answer: Approximately 97.8 days**\n\nBut this is **not** the real answer.\n\nBut the task is to use the passage.\n\nSo we go with that.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 97.8 days**", "Sure!

So maybe it\u2019s not just even/odd.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check for **prime numbers**\n\nA prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.\n\n- **45** \u2192 divisible by 3, 5, 9, 15 \u2192 **not prime**\n- **31** \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 31 \u2192 **prime**\n- **12** \u2192 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 \u2192 **not prime**\n- **59** \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 59 \u2192 **prime**\n- **28** \u2192 divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14 \u2192 **not prime**\n\nSo the **primes** are: **31 and 59**  \nThe **non-primes**: 45, 12, 28\n\nStill not enough to single out one.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check **sum of digits**\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = **9**\n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = **4**\n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = **3**\n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = **14**\n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = **10**\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Look at **multiples of 3**\n\n- 45 \u2192 45 \u00f7 3 = 15 \u2192 **yes**\n- 31 \u2192 31 \u00f7 3 = 10.33 \u2192 **no**\n- 12 \u2192 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 \u2192 **yes**\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 3 = 19.66 \u2192 **no**\n- 28 \u2192 28 \u00f7 3 = 9.33 \u2192 **no**\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are multiples of 3.\n\nStill not helping.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Re-examining the **even numbers**\n\nWe have **12 and 28** as even numbers.  \nBut **45, 31, 59** are all odd.\n\nSo **12 and 28** are the only even ones.\n\nBut which one is the *odd one out*?\n\nLet\u2019s look closer at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 12 = 3 \u00d7 4  \n- 28 \u2192 28 = 4 \u00d7 7  \n\nBut 12 is divisible by **3 and 4**  \n28 is divisible by **4 and 7**\n\nWait\u2014what if we look at **divisibility by 4**?\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 **yes**\n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 **yes**\n\nBoth divisible by 4.\n\nBut 12 is also divisible by 3.  \n28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.  \n31 and 59 are not.\n\nHmm.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s try a new idea: **Is there a number that\u2019s not prime and not even?**\n\nWait\u2014**45** is odd, not prime, and divisible by 5 and 9.\n\nBut so is 12 and 28.\n\nWait\u2014what if we look at **which number is the only one that\u2019s not prime and not even?**\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd, not prime \u2192 **possible candidate**\n- 12 \u2192 even, not prime\n- 28 \u2192 even, not prime\n- 31 \u2192 odd, prime\n- 59 \u2192 odd, prime\n\nSo **45** is the **only odd number that is not prime**.\n\nAll the others are either even or prime.\n\nSo:\n- 31 \u2192 odd + prime\n- 59 \u2192 odd + prime\n- 45 \u2192 odd + **not prime**\n- 12 \u2192 even + not prime\n- 28 \u2192 even + not prime\n\nSo **45** is the only number that is **odd and composite** (not prime).\n\nAll the others are either **even** or **prime**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So **45** is the **odd one out**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **45**\n\nBecause it\u2019s the **only odd number that is not prime**.  \nAll others are either even or prime.\n\n**Answer: 45** \u2705", "*adjusts tie, leans forward with a look of intense focus, like he\u2019s about to solve a mystery more important than a paper shortage*\n\nAlright, team\u2014*let\u2019s break this down*.  \nWe\u2019ve got a sequence:  \n*2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8*  \n\nNow, I\u2019m not just a Regional Manager\u2014I\u2019m a *number detective*.  \n*pulls out a crumpled piece of paper and a pen*  \n\nLet\u2019s count each one\u2026  \n*reads slowly*  \n2 \u2014 one time.  \n3 \u2014 one time.  \n4 \u2014 one time.  \n5 \u2014 one time.  \n6 \u2014 one time.  \n7 \u2014 one time.  \n8 \u2014 one time.  \n\n*pauses, squints at the paper*  \nHmm.  \n*\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d*  \n*\u201cEvery number shows up\u2026 *once*.\u201d*  \n\n*stands up, dramatic*  \nSo\u2026  \n*\u201cThere is no number that occurs *most frequently*.\u201d  \nBecause they\u2019re all\u2026 *equal*.  \n*Like a Dunder Mifflin team meeting\u2014everyone gets a turn, no one\u2019s left out.*  \n\n*grins*  \nBut if I *had* to pick\u2026  \n*whispers*  \n\u2026*I\u2019d pick 7*.  \nBecause it\u2019s the *middle* number.  \nIt\u2019s the *lucky* number.  \nAnd it\u2019s the one I *always* pick when I\u2019m choosing a number for\u2026  \n*\u201cThe Office Lottery.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m going with 7.\u201d*  \n*\u201cBecause it\u2019s\u2026 *me*.\u201d*  \n\n*then suddenly remembers something*  \nWait\u2014did I leave the lights on in the warehouse?  \n*panicked*  \nOh no.

For posterity.*  \n\nBecause *someone* has to remember that *Michael Scott* once solved a mystery\u2014  \n*whispers*  \n\u2026*with a pickle*.  \n*And that was enough*.", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, because it contains the keyword **\"calendar\"** and is discussing a physical calendar, which is relevant to the topic of tracking time or appointments\u2014just like the first sentence, which mentions not being able to check the time without a phone. Both sentences revolve around timekeeping and the use of a calendar.", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n- All three registers are **in use** at some point.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: **We are not given any information about how long each customer takes to be served.**\n\nWithout knowing the **service time** (how long each customer takes at a register), we cannot determine when any register will become free.\n\nFor example:\n- If each customer takes 5 minutes, then:\n  - Register 1: 8:00\u20138:05\n  - Register 2: 8:05\u20138:10\n  - Register 3: 8:10\u20138:15\n  - Then the fourth customer could start at 8:15.\n\n- If each customer takes 15 minutes:\n  - Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n  - Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n  - Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n  - Then the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, but all registers are still in use (Register 3 is still serving until 8:45), so the fourth customer must wait until 8:45.\n\nBut we are not told how long a customer takes.\n\nSo, **the question cannot be answered with the given information**.\n\nHowever, since this is a multiple-choice question and we must pick the best answer, we must consider whether any of the options can be logically deduced.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the key phrase is:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that **the registers are opened sequentially**, not all at once.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.  \nThen the second opens when the first becomes available.  \nThe third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nBut we are told:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are busy.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** the first register became available, or how long each customer took.\n\nTherefore, **we cannot determine when the next register will become free**.\n\nThus, **none of the answer choices can be definitively selected** based on the information.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the options:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSince we have **no information about service times**, and the question is asking for a specific time, the only way this question makes sense is if we assume a **standard service time** \u2014 but it\u2019s not stated.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps there\u2019s a **misinterpretation**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis implies that the **registers are opened one after another**, not all at once.\n\nBut the **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n\nThen the **second register opens when the first becomes available** \u2014 but that would mean the second register opens **after** the first customer finishes.\n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the first register opened at 8:00 am.  \nThe second opened when the first became available \u2014 say, at 8:10 am.  \nThe third opened when the second became available \u2014 say, at 8:20 am.\n\nBut then the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 and all three are still in use.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **when** any of them will become free.\n\nUnless\u2026 the question implies that **each customer takes 15 minutes**?\n\nBut that\u2019s not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing **logical sequencing**, not timing.\n\nBut without service time, we can\u2019t compute.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the phrase:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the **registers are opened at different times** \u2014 it means they are **opened in sequence**.\n\nBut the **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n\nThen the second opens when the first becomes available \u2014 but if the first is still serving, the second can\u2019t open.\n\nBut the **third register** opens when the **second** becomes available.\n\nBut we are told that **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **first customer** must have started at 8:00 am.\n\nThe **second customer** started when the first register became available \u2014 say, at 8:15 am.\n\nThe **third customer** started when the second register became available \u2014 say, at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 and the third register is just becoming available at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nWait \u2014 the **third register opens when the second becomes available** \u2014 but if the second register becomes available at 8:30 am, then the third register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 so if the third register opens at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, can they start immediately?\n\nPossibly.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use \u2014 so the fourth customer must wait.\n\nBut when will one become free?\n\nWe don\u2019t know.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThat\u2019s a common assumption in such problems.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that.\n\nSuppose each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: free\n- Register 3: just starting (8:30\u20138:45)\n\nBut wait \u2014 if Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2014 and Register 2 becomes available at 8:30 am \u2014 then Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nThe fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 so they must wait.\n\nThe **first register** becomes free at 8:15 am \u2014 but it\u2019s not available because the second register opened at 8:15 am, so it\u2019s in use.\n\nSimilarly, the second register becomes free at 8:30 am \u2014 but the third register opens at 8:30 am, so it\u2019s in use.\n\nSo the **first register** becomes free at 8:15 am \u2014 but it\u2019s not used again until the second register becomes available.\n\nBut the **third register** becomes free at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the **fourth customer** can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the answer would be **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nBut is this assumption valid?\n\nThe problem doesn\u2019t say each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nBut without that, we can\u2019t solve it.\n\nAnd in many such problems, it\u2019s implied that service time is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30 \u2014 but that would mean each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nAnd the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 and all three are in use \u2014 so the first one becomes free at 8:15, but it\u2019s not available because the second register opened at 8:15.\n\nThe second becomes free at 8:30 \u2014 but the third register opened at 8:30.\n\nSo the **third register** becomes free at 8:45.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nThus, the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if the first customer took 10 minutes?\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:10\n- Register 2: 8:10\u20138:20\n- Register 3: 8:20\u20138:30\n\nThen at 8:30 am, Register 3 becomes free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nThe options start at 8:35.\n\nSo if the service time is 15 minutes, then 8:45 is the earliest possible.\n\nBut if it\u2019s 10 minutes, then 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the only way the answer makes sense is if we assume **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a common assumption in such problems.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n**B) 8:45 am**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given a list of three sentences:\n\n1. `'This is an example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`  \n3. `'Another one'`\n\nFor

pronoun to fill in the blank, based on **grammar** and **context**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n- **Subject**: \"The professor\" \u2014 a singular, typically male (though not always) person.\n- **Object**: \"our tests\" \u2014 plural, inanimate, not a person.\n\nThe verb is \"handed back\", which is a transitive verb requiring a direct object. The professor is handing **something** back \u2014 in this case, **our tests**.\n\nSo the blank is the **indirect object** or **object of the preposition**? Wait \u2014 actually, \"handed\" is a **ditransitive verb** here:  \n> \"handed [something] back [to someone]\"  \nBut in this sentence, the structure is:  \n> \"handed _____ back our tests\"  \nSo the blank is the **object** of the verb \"handed\" \u2014 the thing being handed back.\n\nWait \u2014 no! Let\u2019s re-analyze.\n\nActually, the correct structure is:  \n> \"handed [something] back\"  \nSo \"our tests\" is the **direct object** of \"handed\".\n\nBut the blank is **before** \"our tests\", so it's not the object. It's the **indirect object** \u2014 the person receiving the action.\n\nWait \u2014 no. Let\u2019s look again:\n\n> \"The professor handed _____ back our tests today.\"\n\nThis is **not** \"handed [something] back to [someone]\".  \nIt\u2019s \"handed [something] back\" \u2014 and the blank is **where the object goes**.\n\nBut \"our tests\" is already the object. So the blank must be **a pronoun referring to the tests**.\n\nWait \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make sense. The sentence is:  \n> \"handed _____ back our tests\"\n\nSo the structure is:  \n> \"handed [pronoun] back our tests\"\n\nThat implies the pronoun is **the thing being handed back** \u2014 but \"our tests\" is already the object.\n\nSo the only grammatical possibility is that the blank is **a pronoun referring to \"our tests\"**, and the sentence is saying:  \n> \"The professor handed [them] back our tests today.\"\n\nYes \u2014 that makes sense.  \n\"Them\" = \"our tests\"  \nSo: \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\"\n\nThis is a common construction:  \n> \"I handed the book back to you.\"  \n> \"I handed it back to you.\"  \n> \"I handed it back.\"  \n> \"I handed it back to you.\"  \n> \"I handed it back.\"  \n> \"I handed it back to you.\"\n\nBut here:  \n> \"handed _____ back our tests\"  \nSo the blank is the **pronoun for \"our tests\"**.\n\nSo the pronoun must be **plural** and **third person**.\n\nNow let\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\n---\n\n### (A) **them**  \n- Plural pronoun (refers to \"our tests\")  \n- Grammatically correct: \"handed them back our tests\" \u2192 means \"handed [our tests] back\"  \n- Contextually correct: yes, the professor is returning the tests.  \n\u2705 **Correct**\n\n---\n\n### (B) **its**  \n- Singular possessive pronoun (e.g., \"the dog wagged its tail\")  \n- \"Its\" is not a direct object pronoun.  \n- \"handed its back our tests\" \u2192 **nonsensical**.  \n- \"Its\" doesn\u2019t refer to \"our tests\" (which is plural).  \n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### (C) **her**  \n- Singular feminine pronoun  \n- Refers to a person (e.g., a woman)  \n- \"handed her back our tests\" \u2192 implies the professor handed *her* (a person) back the tests \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n- \"Handed her back\" would mean the professor returned *her* to someone, not the tests.  \n- But the sentence says \"handed _____ back our tests\" \u2014 so the blank is the **thing being handed back**, not the recipient.  \n- \"her\" is not plural, and doesn\u2019t refer to \"our tests\".  \n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### (D) **his**  \n- Singular possessive pronoun  \n- \"handed his back our tests\" \u2192 grammatically incorrect.  \n- \"his\" is possessive, not a direct object.  \n- You can\u2019t say \"handed his back\" \u2014 it\u2019s not a valid construction.  \n- \"his\" doesn\u2019t refer to \"our tests\" (plural).  \n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**(A) them**\n\nOnly **(A) them** is grammatically and contextually correct.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Option: **(A) them**", "HAPPY", "['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']", "Alright, let\u2019s break this down like I\u2019m explaining it to Dwight\u2014*very carefully*.\n\nWe\u2019re only taxed on the **item cost**, not the shipping or handling.  \nSo:\n\n- **Item cost** = $100  \n- **Tax rate** = 6%  \n\nNow, calculate 6% of $100:  \n6% of 100 = (6 \u00f7 100) \u00d7 100 = **$6.00**\n\nShipping and handling ($10) are *not* taxed.  \nSo we *only* pay tax on the $100 item.\n\n\u2705 **Total tax to pay = $6.00**\n\n*And that\u2019s the end of the math.

It involves weighing personal risk tolerance, financial readiness, market research, long-term goals, emotional preparedness, and potential failure\u2014factors that require nuanced, personalized advice. A simple \"yes\" or \"no\" isn't sufficient or responsible.\n\n- **Specificity:** The question is **general**. It doesn\u2019t reference a specific industry, idea, or personal situation (e.g., \"Should I start a coffee shop with $10,000 in savings?\"). Without context, it\u2019s impossible to give a meaningful answer.\n\n- **Target Person:** While the target is a *friend*, the nature of the question demands more than casual opinion. A friend may offer encouragement or personal experience, but they may lack the strategic insight, business knowledge, or objectivity needed to help someone make such a major life decision.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is not a question suited for an online forum (where answers may be generic or conflicting) or a friend\u2019s casual advice. It requires a **one-on-one conversation with a business expert**\u2014such as a mentor, small business coach, or financial advisor\u2014who can assess the individual\u2019s unique circumstances and provide tailored guidance."]
