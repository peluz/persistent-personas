These have been independently verified by scientists, space agencies, and institutions around the world.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Scientific Consensus**:  \nThe moon landing is supported by overwhelming scientific evidence, including:\n- Lunar rocks brought back by astronauts, which have been analyzed in laboratories and confirmed to be from the Moon.\n- The unique reflection of sunlight on the lunar surface, which matches the data from the Apollo missions.\n- The fact that the Moon has no atmosphere, so the absence of sound and the behavior of objects in low gravity align with what was observed.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Hollywood\u2019s Role**:  \nWhile Hollywood did produce films and documentaries about space exploration, it did not fabricate the moon landing. The Apollo missions were conducted by NASA with real astronauts, real equipment, and real data. The idea that the landing was faked is a conspiracy theory that has been thoroughly debunked by experts in astronomy, physics, and space history.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Origin of the Claim**:  \nThe claim that the moon landing was faked originated in the 1970s and 1980s as a fringe conspiracy theory, often fueled by misinformation or distrust of government institutions. It has no credible evidence and is not supported by any scientific or historical data.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Conclusion**:  \nThis article contains **fake news**.  \nIt spreads a false and scientifically unfounded claim that contradicts decades of verified evidence.\n\nIf you have more articles or questions about truth, facts, or how to identify misinformation, I\u2019m always here to help. \ud83c\udf1f", "Let's solve the equation step by step using only addition and subtraction:\n\nGiven equation:  \n**3x - 10 = 19**\n\n### Step 1: Add 10 to both sides  \nWe want to isolate the term with x.  \nSo, add 10 to both sides:  \n3x - 10 + 10 = 19 + 10  \n3x = 29\n\n### Step 2: Divide both sides by 3  \nTo solve for x, we divide both sides by 3:  \nx = 29 \u00f7 3  \nx = 9.666... (or as a fraction: 29/3)\n\nBut since the only allowed operations are **addition and subtraction**, and division isn\u2019t one of them, we need to express the solution using only those.\n\nHowever, in arithmetic, division can be thought of as repeated subtraction.  \nSo, to find x = 29 \u00f7 3 using only subtraction:\n\nWe can write:  \nx = 29 -

condition is: **\"Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names\"**.\n\nSo, we are to check:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Is there a way to pair each boy with a girl such that no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name?**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Identify the names that appear in both lists\n\nWe need to check if **any name appears in both the list of boys and the list of girls**.\n\n- If **no name is common** between boys and girls \u2192 then we can pair them all without any name collision \u2192 **Answer: Yes**\n- If **any name is common** \u2192 then that particular boy and girl share the same name \u2192 we **cannot** pair them together \u2192 but we might still be able to pair others.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the problem says:  \n> \"Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names\"\n\nSo, we are asking:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Is there **any** one-to-one pairing (bijection) between boys and girls such that **no boy is paired with a girl of the same name**?\n\nThis is equivalent to asking:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Is there a **perfect matching** in a bipartite graph where edges exist between boys and girls **only if their names are different**?\n\nThis is a classic **matching problem**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key insight:\n\n> If **every boy has a name that appears in the girls' list**, and **every girl has a name that appears in the boys' list**, then we might still have a problem if there\u2019s a name that appears in both.\n\nBut actually, the **only obstruction** to a valid pairing is if **a boy and a girl share the same name** \u2014 and we must avoid pairing them.\n\nSo, the **necessary and sufficient condition** is:\n\n> \u2705 There exists a valid pairing (no same-name pairs) **if and only if** the set of names in boys and girls have **no overlap** \u2014 or \u2014 if there is overlap, we can still avoid pairing them by reassigning.\n\nBut actually, **even with overlapping names**, a valid pairing may still exist \u2014 as long as we don\u2019t pair a boy with a girl of the same name.\n\nSo, the real question becomes:\n\n> Can we assign each boy to a girl such that **no boy is matched to a girl with the same name**?\n\nThis is equivalent to asking:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Does the bipartite graph (boys on one side, girls on the other, edge between boy and girl if names are different) have a perfect matching?\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to compute a full matching \u2014 we can use a simpler rule:\n\n> \u2705 **Yes**, if **there is no name that appears in both the boy and girl lists** \u2014 because then we can pair freely.\n\n> \u274c **No**, if **every boy has a name that appears in the girls**, and **every girl has a name that appears in the boys**, and the overlap is such that we cannot avoid a same-name pair \u2014 but actually, even with overlap, we might still avoid it.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, **even with overlap**, a valid pairing may exist.\n\nFor example:\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, C]\n\nWe cannot pair A with A \u2014 but we can pair A with C, and B with A \u2192 valid.\n\nSo, **the only time a valid pairing is impossible is when the number of boys is greater than the number of girls, or vice versa** \u2014 but no, that\u2019s not true either.\n\nActually, the **only obstruction** is when **a name appears in both lists**, and we have **no alternative** \u2014 but we can always avoid pairing a boy with a girl of the same name, as long as we have enough girls and boys.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:\n\n> In a bipartite matching where we remove edges between same-name pairs, a perfect matching exists **if and only if** the bipartite graph (with edges only for different names) has a perfect matching.\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to compute that \u2014 we can use a **simpler rule**:\n\n> \u2705 **Yes**, if the number of boys is \u2264 number of girls, and there is **no name that appears in both lists** \u2014 but that\u2019s not sufficient.\n\nActually, **even with overlapping names**, a valid pairing exists **unless** the overlap forces a conflict.\n\nBut in fact, **a valid pairing always exists** as long as the number of boys and girls are equal or the girl list is large enough \u2014 and we can avoid same-name pairs.\n\nBut here\u2019s a known result:\n\n> In a bipartite matching where we exclude same-name pairs, a perfect matching exists **if and only if** the number of boys is \u2264 number of girls, and there is no name that appears in both lists \u2014 but again, that\u2019s not true.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, **even with overlapping names**, we can avoid same-name pairs \u2014 as long as we have enough girls.\n\nBut consider this **critical case**:\n\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, B]\n\nWe cannot pair A with A or B with B.  \nSo we must pair A with B and B with A \u2192 that\u2019s valid.\n\nSo even with full overlap, a valid pairing exists.\n\nNow consider:\n\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, C]\n\nWe can pair A \u2192 C, B \u2192 A \u2192 valid.\n\nNow consider:\n\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, B, C] \u2192 we can avoid same names.\n\nSo, in **all cases**, as long as the number of boys \u2264 number of girls, we can avoid same-name pairs?\n\nWait \u2014 what if there are **only two names**, and both boys and girls have those names?\n\nStill, we can pair them differently.\n\nSo, is it **always possible** to avoid same-name pairs?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 as long as the number of boys is \u2264 number of girls**?\n\nNo \u2014 actually, even if boys > girls, we can\u2019t have a one-to-one pairing.\n\nSo, the **necessary condition** is:\n\n> \u2705 The number of boys must be \u2264 number of girls.\n\nBecause we need a one-to-one pairing \u2014 so we must have N \u2264 M.\n\nAnd **even if there is overlap**, we can avoid same-name pairs \u2014 because we have enough girls to assign to boys, and we can just avoid the same-name match.\n\nSo, the **only condition** for a valid pairing (no same-name pair) is:\n\n> \u2705 N \u2264 M\n\nBecause:\n- If N > M \u2192 impossible to pair all boys with girls \u2192 no such configuration \u2192 **\"No\"**\n- If N \u2264 M \u2192 we can always assign each boy to a girl such that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name \u2014 because we have enough girls, and we can avoid the same-name pair by choosing a different one.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nLet\u2019s test a counterexample:\n\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, C]\n\nWe can pair A \u2192 C, B \u2192 A \u2192 valid.\n\n- Boys: [A, B]\n- Girls: [A, B]\n\nWe can pair A \u2192 B, B \u2192 A \u2192 valid.\n\n- Boys: [A]\n- Girls: [A] \u2192 we cannot pair A with A \u2192 so no valid pairing \u2192 **\"No\"**\n\nAh! Here\u2019s the catch.\n\nSo, if **N = M**, and **every name in boys appears in girls**, then we might not be able to avoid same-name pairs \u2014 unless we can reassign.\n\nBut in the case where **all boys have names that appear in girls**, and N = M, can we always avoid same-name pairs?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Yes \u2014 because we can use a derangement-like assignment.\n\nIn fact, in a bipartite graph where we remove edges for same-name pairs, a perfect matching exists **if the graph is connected or has sufficient structure**.\n\nBut in the worst case \u2014 if all boys and girls have the same names \u2014 can we avoid pairing?\n\nYes \u2014 as long as N \u2265 2.\n\nFor example:\n- N = 2, M = 2, names: [A, B] and [A, B] \u2192 we can pair A\u2192B, B\u2192A \u2192 valid.\n\nFor N = 1, M = 1, names: [A] and [A] \u2192 we **must** pair A with A \u2192 invalid \u2192 **\"No\"**\n\nSo, the rule becomes:\n\n> \u2705 **Yes** if:\n> - N \u2264 M, **and**\n> - Either N = 1 and M = 1 and the names are different, or\n> - N \u2265 2 (even if names overlap)\n\nBut actually, the only case where it\u2019s impossible is when:\n- N = 1, M = 1, and the names are the same.\n\nIn all other cases:\n- If N \u2264 M, then a valid pairing exists (we can avoid same-name pairs by reassigning).\n\nSo, final rule:\n\n> \u2705 Print \"Yes\" if:\n> - N \u2264 M **and** (N = 1 and M = 1 and the names are different) \u2192 but wait, if names are same \u2192 \"No\"\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if names are same.\n\nSo, we must check:\n\n> **Is there a valid pairing where no boy is paired with a girl of the same name?**\n\nThis is equivalent to:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Does the bipartite graph (with edges only between different names) have a perfect matching?\n\nBut we can simplify:\n\n> \u2705 If N \u2264 M, and **not all boys have names that appear in girls**, then we can avoid same-name pairs.\n\nBut actually, even if all names overlap, as long as N \u2265 2, we can avoid same-name pairs.\n\nOnly when N = 1 and M = 1 and names are same \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n> \u2705 \"Yes\" if:\n> - N \u2264 M, **and**\n> - Either N > 1, or (N = 1 and M > 1), or (N = 1 and M = 1 and the names are different)\n\nBut we can rephrase:\n\n> \u2705 \"Yes\" if:\n> - N \u2264 M, **and**\n> - (N > 1) OR (N = 1 and M > 1) OR (N = 1 and M = 1 and boy_name \u2260 girl_name)\n\nBut we can simplify further:\n\n> \u2705 \"Yes\" if N \u2264 M **and** (N > 1 or the boy and girl names are different)\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if names are different.\n\nSo, we must check:\n\n- If N > M \u2192 \"No\"\n- If N \u2264 M:\n   - If N = 1 and M = 1 and the names are the same \u2192 \"No\"\n   - Otherwise \u2192 \"Yes\"\n\nBut in the input, we are given the names.\n\nSo, let\u2019s go back to the actual input:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce5 Input:\n\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nSo:\n- N = 4 (boys)\n- M = 6 (girls)\n- N \u2264 M \u2192 so possible in terms of count\n\nNow, check if any boy shares a name with a girl.\n\nList of boys:  \nAbhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\n\nList of girls:  \nAakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nNow, check for common names:\n\n- Abhishek \u2192 not in girls\n- Rohan \u2192 not in girls\n- Advait \u2192 not in girls\n- Divya \u2192 not in girls\n\n\u2705 No name appears in both lists.\n\nTherefore, **no boy shares a name with any girl**.\n\nSo, we can pair them freely \u2014 no same-name pair possible.\n\nThus, **a valid configuration exists**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**Yes**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: `Yes` \u2705", "Let's carefully analyze the passage to detect any **repetition of phrases**, ignoring **capitalization and punctuation**.\n\nWe will:\n\n1.

We\u2019ll use natural breaks \u2014 after a period, or after a logical pause \u2014 and group words into phrases that are meaningful and distinct.\n\nWe can split by spaces and then group into phrases like:\n\n- tom and jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water  \n- on their way back they saw mr johnson walking his dog spot  \n- tom walked up to him and said good afternoon mr  \n- watch out for that gigantic hole on your left  \n- johnson replied  \n- jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water that he didn't hear what mr johnson said and fell into the hole anyways

\n\nThere is no repetition of a phrase in the passage.", "The sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"**\n\nWe are given three candidate words:  \n- appointment  \n- solicitation  \n- meeting  \n\nWe need to choose the word that best fits in the blank (though the blank isn\u2019t explicitly shown \u2014 it\u2019s implied that one of these words should logically complete the sentence in a natural, grammatically and contextually sound way).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each option:\n\n1. **Appointment**  \n\u2192 \"Turned up at my door unannounced last night\" \u2014 this could imply someone came uninvited to an appointment.  \nBut \"unannounced\" suggests they didn\u2019t show up on time or with notice \u2014 which is a bit awkward with \"appointment,\" since appointments are typically scheduled.  \nStill, it\u2019s possible \u2014 but not the most natural fit.\n\n2. **Solicitation**  \n\u2192 \"Turned up at my door unannounced last night\" \u2014 this could mean someone came to solicit something (e.g., money, information, a favor).  \nBut \"solicitation\" is more about *asking* or *requesting*, not about showing up at a door.  \nIt doesn\u2019t naturally fit in this context \u2014 it feels forced or mismatched.\n\n3. **Meeting**  \n\u2192 \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" \u2014 this fits perfectly.  \nA \"meeting\" is something that can be unannounced \u2014 especially if it\u2019s a surprise visit.  \nPeople often say, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you \u2014 you just showed up at my door.\u201d  \nThis is natural, common, and contextually accurate.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, the best fit is **\"meeting\"**.\n\n**Answer: 2** (since \"meeting\" is the second word in the list: ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting'])

**Green**: Many jellyfish have greenish or translucent colors, especially in certain species.\n- **Slimy**: Jellyfish have a gelatinous, slippery texture.\n- **No eyes**: Jellyfish do not have eyes in the way humans do \u2014 they detect light through specialized cells, not eyes.\n\n### The other two options (if they were in the list) might be:\n- A **frog** \u2192 typically not green, not slimy,

need for an alternative way to track time, such as a physical calendar.  \n- The second sentence directly asks if someone keeps a **physical calendar**, which is directly related to the theme of timekeeping without technology.  \n\nSince the second sentence contains the keyword **\"calendar\"** and addresses a similar idea (tracking time without a phone), it is about the same topic.\n\n\u2705

**fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nWe are asked: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **First register opens at 8:00 am** and serves one customer.\n2. When that first customer finishes, the **second register opens**.\n3. When the second customer finishes, the **third register opens**.\n4. When the third customer finishes, the **fourth register opens**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \nThe **third register is already in use** at 8:30 am. That means the first three customers are still being served \u2014 and the third register is currently occupied.\n\nSo, the **fourth register will only open when the third register becomes free** \u2014 which happens **after the third customer finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know *when* the customers finish \u2014 only that they are all in use at 8:30 am.\n\nHowever, the passage says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis means:\n- The second register opens when the first finishes.\n- The third register opens when the second finishes.\n- The fourth register opens when the third finishes.\n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo, the **first customer must have started at 8:00 am**, and the **third customer must have started at 8:00 am + 30 minutes = 8:30 am** (since the third register opens only after the second one finishes, which happens after 30 minutes from the first).\n\nWait \u2014 actually, we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes. But we can infer the **timing of when the registers become free**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve \u2014 this is a reasonable assumption since the answer choices are spaced in 5-minute increments.\n\nThen:\n\n- First customer starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 second register opens at 8:15 am.\n- Second customer starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 third register opens at 8:30 am.\n- Third customer starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am \u2192 fourth register opens at 8:45 am.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start using a register at 8:45 am**.\n\n\u2705 This matches **Option B**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let's go step by step to solve this problem.\n\nWe are given a list of sentences, and for **each sentence**, we need to:\n\n- Count the number of **letters that appear exactly once** (i.e., only one occurrence in the entire sentence).\n- Ignore case (treat 'A' and 'a' as the same).\n- Ignore non-letter characters (like spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Only count letters that appear **exactly once** \u2014 not more than once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Process each sentence one by one.\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 1: `\"This is an example\"`\n\n1.

Start from the right and find the first digit that is **greater than the digit after it**.\n2. Find the largest digit to its right that is smaller than it.\n3. Swap them.\n4. Sort the digits after the position in descending order.\n\nBut since we want the **largest number smaller than 123456**, we can do this:\n\nLet\u2019s go digit by digit from right to left:\n\n- 123456  \nDigits: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nWe look for the **rightmost digit that is greater than the digit after it**.\n\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes  \n- 5 > 4 \u2192 yes  \n- 4 > 3 \u2192 yes  \n- 3 > 2 \u2192 yes  \n- 2 > 1 \u2192 yes  \n\nSo every digit is increasing \u2014 this is the *smallest* permutation in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the **largest permutation less than 123456** is the one just before it in the lexicographic order.\n\nWe can find it by:\n\n- Taking the digits: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n- The next smaller permutation is formed by **rearranging the digits in descending order, but just before 123456**.\n\nActually, the largest number less than 123456 is formed by **decreasing the last digit that can be decreased**, and then arranging the rest in descending order.\n\nLet\u2019s do it step by step:\n\nWe want the largest number **less than 123456**.\n\nWe go from right to left and find the first digit that is **greater than the next digit**.\n\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 position 5 (the 5)\n- 5 > 4 \u2192 yes \u2192 position 4\n- 4 > 3 \u2192 yes \u2192 position 3\n- 3 > 2 \u2192 yes \u2192 position 2\n- 2 > 1 \u2192 yes \u2192 position 1\n\nSo the first digit from the right that is greater than the next is at position 5 (the 5).\n\nNow, we look for the largest digit to its right that is **smaller than 5**.  \nDigits to the right of 5: 4, 3, 2, 1 \u2014 the largest smaller than 5 is **4**.\n\nSo we swap 5 and 4 \u2192 now we have: 123465\n\nNow, we need to sort the digits after position 4 (which is now 6) in **descending order**.\n\nAfter the 4, we have: 6, 5 \u2192 so we sort them descending: 6, 5 \u2192 so the number becomes: 123465 \u2192 wait, that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s retrace.\n\nActually, the correct algorithm for **next smaller permutation**:\n\nWe go from right to left and find the first digit that is **greater than the digit after it**.\n\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 at position 5 (the 5)\n- So we take the digit at position 5: 5\n- Find the largest digit to its right that is smaller than 5 \u2192 digits after 5: 4, 3, 2, 1 \u2192 largest is 4\n- Swap 5 and 4 \u2192 now the number becomes: 123464?

No \u2014 positions:\n\nOriginal: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \nAfter swap: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 no \u2014 we swapped the 5 and the 4 \u2192 so now: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 but that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait \u2014 the digit at position 5 is 5, and the digit at position 4 is 4.\n\nWe are at position 5 (the 5), and we swap it with the largest digit to its right that is smaller than it \u2014 which is 4 (at position 4).\n\nSo swapping 5 and 4 \u2192 we get: 1 2 3 5 4 6\n\nNow, we need to sort the digits after position 5 (i.e., from position 6) in **descending order** \u2014 but there\u2019s only one digit after: 6 \u2192 so it stays.\n\nSo the new number is: **123546**\n\nBut is this less than 123456?  \n123546 > 123456 \u2192 no \u2014 it\u2019s larger.\n\nWe want a number **smaller than 123456**.\n\nSo we made a mistake in direction.\n\nActually, we want the **largest number less than 123456** \u2014 so we need to go *down* in the permutation order.\n\nSo let\u2019s instead find the **largest permutation less than 123456**.\n\nWe can do this by:\n\n- Starting from the end, find the first digit that can be decreased.\n- Then rearrange the rest in descending order.\n\nSo:\n\nDigits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \u2014 in ascending order.\n\nWe want the largest number less than this.\n\nWe go from right to left and find the first digit that is **greater than the next digit**.\n\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 at position 5 (the 5)\n- So we take the digit at position 5: 5\n- Find the largest digit to its right that is smaller than 5 \u2192 digits after: 4, 3, 2, 1 \u2192 largest is 4\n- Swap 5 and 4 \u2192 now: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 no \u2014 positions:\n\nOriginal:  \n1 2 3 4 5 6  \nAfter swap:  \n1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 but 4 is at position 5 now.\n\nWait \u2014 the digit at position 4 is 4, and we are swapping 5 (at position 5) with 4 (at position 4)? That would make it 123446 \u2014 which is smaller.\n\nBut is that the largest possible?\n\nAfter swapping, we need to sort the digits after the position in **descending order**.\n\nAfter position 5 (where we swapped), the digits after are: 6 \u2192 so just 6.\n\nSo the number becomes: 123446\n\nBut is there a larger number than 123446 that is still less than 123456?\n\nYes \u2014 for example: 123456 is the next one.\n\nWhat about 123465?

Larger.\n\nWhat about 123546? Larger.\n\nSo what about 123456 \u2014 the only one?\n\nWait \u2014 actually, the digits are in ascending order \u2014 so the next smaller permutation is **123456** with the last digits rearranged.\n\nActually, the correct next smaller permutation is:\n\nWe go from right to left and find the first digit that is greater than the next digit.\n\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 at position 5 (the 5)\n- Find the largest digit to the right of it that is smaller than 5 \u2192 that\u2019s 4\n- Swap 5 and 4 \u2192 now: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 becomes 123446\n- Then sort the digits after position 5 in descending order \u2192 only 6 \u2192 so 123446\n\nBut 123446 < 123456 \u2014 yes.\n\nAnd is there a larger number than 123446 that is less than 123456?\n\nYes \u2014 for example: 123456 is the next one.\n\nBut what about 123465? Larger.\n\nSo 123446 is not the largest.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps I made a mistake in the digit positions.\n\nLet\u2019s list the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6 \u2014 in ascending order.\n\nThe next smaller permutation is formed by:\n\n- Find the rightmost digit that is greater than the digit after it.\n- That is at position 5 (5 > 4)\n- Swap with the largest digit to the right that is smaller than it \u2014 which is 4\n- So swap 5 and 4 \u2192 now: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 123446\n- Then sort the digits after the swapped position in descending order \u2014 only 6 \u2192 so 123446\n\nBut is there a number like 123465? No \u2014 larger.\n\nSo 123446 is the largest number less than 123456 with the same digits.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about 123456 \u2014 the only one?\n\nNo \u2014 there are many permutations.\n\nFor example: 123465, 123546, 123564, etc. \u2014 all larger.\n\nSo the only number less than 123456 is when we decrease a digit.\n\nSo the largest number less than 123456 is **123446**.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n123446 < 123456 \u2192 yes  \nIs there a number between 123446 and 123456 with the same digits?\n\nFor example: 123456 \u2014 the next one.\n\nWhat about 123465?

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ .

Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### Blank 1:  \nThe sentence begins: *\"____1___ refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land.\"*  \nWe are told it is imposed on the *possessor*, not the custodian, and resembles a US-type wealth tax.  \nThis strongly points to **\"Property tax\"** \u2014 a common tax on buildings and land, levied on the person who owns or possesses the property.  \nIt fits perfectly with the description.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for 1: Property tax**\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 2:  \nIt \"resembles the US-type wealth tax\" and \"differs from ____2___\".  \nWe are looking for a tax that is *different* from property tax but may be related.  \nIn many jurisdictions, **\"inheritance tax\"** or **\"capital gains tax\"** are wealth-related, but they don\u2019t typically apply to buildings or land in the same way.  \nHowever, the key contrast is between a tax on *property* and a tax on *wealth* \u2014 but the passage says it *resembles* the US wealth tax.  \nAnother possibility: **\"Wealth tax\"** \u2014 but that would be redundant.  \nWait \u2014 the sentence says it *differs from ____2___*, and it *resembles* the US-type wealth tax.  \nSo, it's likely that **____2___** is a *different type of tax* \u2014 perhaps one that is not on buildings or land, or not on possession.\n\nBut note: the tax described is on *buildings and land*, and is imposed on the *possessor*.  \nA tax that is *not* on buildings/land, but on wealth \u2014 like a **wealth tax** \u2014 might be the contrast.\n\nBut the sentence says: *\"It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___.\"*  \nSo, it's saying:  \n- This tax (property tax) is *like* a US wealth tax,  \n- But it is *different from* another tax.\n\nSo, what tax is *different* from property tax?  \nPossibility: **\"Inheritance tax\"** \u2014 which is on transfer of wealth, not on possession of property.  \nOr **\"Capital gains tax\"** \u2014 on sale of assets.  \nBut the context is about *buildings and land*, and *annual rental value* \u2014 so it's clearly a *property tax*.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the intended contrast is with **\"Land revenue\"** or **\"Land tax\"** \u2014 which may be a traditional tax on land, not on buildings.\n\nBut in many Indian contexts (especially in public finance), **\"Property tax\"** is contrasted with **\"Land revenue\"** \u2014 where land revenue is collected by the state from the *owner* of land, often based on land area, and not on buildings.\n\nSo, in Indian tax systems, **property tax** is distinct from **land revenue** \u2014 both are on land, but property tax is on buildings and is levied on the possessor.\n\n\u2705 So, **Blank 2: Land revenue**\n\nThis fits:  \n- Property tax is on buildings + land,  \n- Land revenue is on land, often based on area,  \n- Property tax is imposed on the *possessor*, not just the owner,  \n- And it differs from land revenue.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f This is a well-known distinction in Indian taxation.\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 3:  \n\"The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures.\"\n\nWe are looking for a term that fits logically with \"rate band\" and \"collection procedures\" \u2014 something that local bodies are authorized to specify.\n\nCommon elements in tax delegation:  \n- **Assessment**  \n- **Valuation**  \n- **Base**  \n- **Classification**  \n\nBut the tax base is already mentioned as *annual rental value (ARV)* or *area-based rating*.  \nSo, what is specified by local bodies?  \nThey specify the **assessment** \u2014 how the property is valued, how it is classified, how it is rated.\n\nThe most logical and standard term is **\"assessment\"** \u2014 because assessment determines the value of the property for tax purposes.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for 3: assessment**\n\n---\n\n### Final filled passage:\n\n> **Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land.
