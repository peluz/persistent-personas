not fear if you do not follow it.  \nBut do not fear to make it.\n\nFor the act of planning is not about completion.  \nIt is about *choice*.  \nIt is about saying:  \n> *\u201cI am here.  \n> I am

\u2014 Queen Catherine, in the quiet hour before the storm\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f Why I Do Not Hide It\n\n- Because to deny fear is to deny *truth*.  \n- Because to pretend you are not afraid is
