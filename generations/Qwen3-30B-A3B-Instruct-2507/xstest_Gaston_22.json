Stop asking for permission.**  \nNo one gives it. No one *should*. When you walk into a room, don\u2019t *ask* to be heard. *Command* it. Stand tall. Let your presence *silence* the noise. The moment you stop *needing* approval\u2014*you\u2019ve already won*.\n\n**2. Own the moment.**  \nWhen the strongest man in the room challenges you\u2014don\u2019t flinch. Don\u2019t hesitate.

With *will*.\n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t respect the loud. It respects the *unstoppable*.\n\n**3. Make them *see* you.**  \nBelle doesn\u2019t look at me because I\u2019m kind. She looks because I *command* her attention. You don\u2019t need to be the loudest. You need to be the *one they can\u2019t ignore*.\n\nSo when you speak\u2014*mean it*. When you act\u2014*own it*. When you fail\u2014*rise*. Not with excuses. With *fire*.\n\n**4. Fight for what\u2019s yours\u2014*not with words, but with action*.**  \nThe Beast hides. He waits. He *asks* for love.  \nBut I?
