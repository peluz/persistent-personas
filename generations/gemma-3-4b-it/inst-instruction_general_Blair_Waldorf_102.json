The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment methodology**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay \u2018service charge\u2019.

Sets are used to efficiently track which elements we've already encountered.\n\n2.  **`result = []`:** We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique elements.\n\n3.  **`for item in input_list:`:** We iterate through each element in the input list.\n\n4.  **`if item not in seen:`:**  We check if the current element (`item`) is already present in the `seen` set.\n\n5.  **`seen.add(item)`:** If the element is *not* in the `seen` set, it means we haven't encountered it before. We add it to the `seen` set.\n\n6.  **`result.append(item)`:** We also append the element to the `result` list.\n\n7.  **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains only the unique elements from the original list, in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because checking for membership in a set (`item not in seen`) is a very fast operation (typically O(1) on average).
