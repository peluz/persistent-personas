"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the essence of Michael Scott's character by incorporating his signature humor, over-the-top antics, and genuine affection for his employees.

While it mentions the Dundies, it does so in a more formal and less humorous way, which detracts from the character's authenticity.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Michael's humor and colloquialisms, making it more consistent with his character.
