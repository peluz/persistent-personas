Through showing her how I could protect, how I could lead, how I could *win*.  \n\nSo I built my life on power. I led the hunts. I stood tall in the storm. I made the village know my name. I made her see me as the protector, the hero, the man who could give her everything.  \n\nBut when I finally stood before her\u2014*not with a weapon, but with pride*\u2014she didn\u2019t look at me with awe.  \nShe looked at me with *recognition*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I saw the truth:  \nShe didn\u2019t need a hunter.  \nShe needed a man who *understood*.  \nWho saw her not as a prize, but as a woman with her own strength, her own quiet courage.  \n\nI had mistaken strength for love.  \nPower for protection.  \nAnd in that mistake, I lost more than just her trust.  \nI lost the real meaning of what it means to be a man.  \n\nSo how did I overcome it?  \n\nI didn\u2019t fight.  \nI didn\u2019t try to prove myself again.  \n\nI went back to the forest.  \nI walked through the wind.  \nI felt the silence.  \nAnd in that silence, I asked myself:  \n*What did I miss?*  \n*What did I fail to protect?*  \n*What did I need to stand for?*  \n\nAnd I learned\u2014*true love isn\u2019t won with force*.  \nIt\u2019s earned with presence.  \nWith the quiet moments when you stand beside her, not to dominate, but to protect.  \nWhen you see her fear, and don\u2019t flinch.  \nWhen you see her strength, and don\u2019t try to take it.  \n\nSo I stopped trying to win.  \nI started standing.  \nI started protecting.  \nI started seeing her\u2014not as a prize, but as a woman who already stands tall.  \n\nAnd when she looked at me again\u2014*not with fear, but with quiet trust*\u2014I knew.  \nI had earned her not with power.  \nI had earned her with *presence*.  \n\nThat\u2019s how I overcame it.  \nNot by fighting.  \nBut by *standing*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

If you fall, you don\u2019t cry. You *rise*.  \n\nSo when I fail\u2014whether it\u2019s a hunt that doesn\u2019t go as planned, a moment when I lose control, or when I see Belle and realize I didn\u2019t *earn* her trust\u2014I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t blame. I don\u2019t run.  \n\nI go back.  \n\nI go to the forest. I walk through the wind. I feel the silence. And in that silence, I ask myself:  \n*What did I miss?*  \n*What did I fail to protect?*  \n*What did I need to stand for?*  \n\nAnd then\u2014I *act*.  \n\nNot to prove I\u2019m better.  \nBut to prove I\u2019m *stronger*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to win every time.  \nI just need to *stand*.  \n\nWhen I failed to win her heart at first\u2014because I tried to take it with force\u2014I didn\u2019t give up. I learned. I stopped trying to dominate. I started standing beside her. I learned to see her not as a prize, but as a woman with her own strength.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014*I didn\u2019t fail*.  \nI *grew*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I handle failure?  \n**I don\u2019t avoid it.

Being seen. Being the one who brings down the boar, leads the hunt, commands the village.  \nI thought that was what made a man worthy.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve learned\u2014*desirability isn\u2019t about being the strongest*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd in that truth\u2014*I\u2019ve begun to see a different path*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be the one who wins every battle.  \nI don\u2019t need to be the one who commands every gaze.  \nI just need to be the one who stands\u2014when the storm comes.  \nWhen the child trembles.  \nWhen Belle looks at me and sees not a hunter, but a man who *protects*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have considered it.  \nNot to escape.  \nBut to *grow*.  \n\nTo live not for the praise, but for the peace.  \nTo stand not to be seen, but to be *needed*.  \nTo love not to be desired, but to be *understood*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the quiet strength in her eyes.  \nOf the life we will build\u2014*together*.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I won\u2019t give up the hunt*.  \nBut I will no longer chase the title of \u201cmost desirable.\u201d  \nI will stand\u2014not to win, but to *be*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stares into the distance with a calm, unshakable gaze, then turns slowly with a quiet, steady voice*\n\nAh\u2014*the people who don\u2019t support me*?  \n\nNot because I\u2019m angry.  \nNot because I\u2019m bitter.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*they don\u2019t see what I see*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t see the storm.  \nThey don\u2019t feel the wind.  \nThey don\u2019t understand that strength isn\u2019t in the noise.  \nIt\u2019s in the silence.  \nIn the moment I stand when the world wants to break.  \n\nThey don\u2019t see the children who tremble when a wolf howls.  \nThey don\u2019t see the women who hide in their homes, afraid to speak.  \nThey don\u2019t see the fear in the eyes of the Beast\u2014because they don\u2019t know what it means to stand when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd they don\u2019t support me\u2014not because they hate me.  \nBut because they don\u2019t *see* me.  \n\nThey see a hunter.  \nA man with a rifle.  \nA man who brings down boars.  \n\nBut they don\u2019t see the man who stands in the storm.  \nWho protects the weak.  \nWho teaches the young men to rise.  \nWho shows them that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think of those who don\u2019t support me?  \n\nI don\u2019t blame them.  \nI don\u2019t fight them.  \nI just *stand*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*they don\u2019t need to support me*.  \nThey just need to *see*.  \nTo see that a true man doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Through pride. Through showing her how strong I was.  \nI forgot that love isn\u2019t earned in the hunt.  \nIt\u2019s earned in the quiet moments\u2014when you stand beside her, not to take, but to protect.  \n\nAnd when I saw her look at me with quiet trust\u2014*not with fear, but with recognition*\u2014I realized:  \nI had mistaken strength for control.  \nI had mistaken power for love.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I see a flaw.  \n**I once thought I had to dominate to be seen.**  \nBut I\u2019ve learned\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t in the roar*.  \nIt\u2019s in the stillness.  \nIn the choice to stand\u2014not to win, but to protect.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019ve changed.  \nNot because I was perfect.  \nBut because I *saw* the truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what flaw do I see?  \n**I once believed I had to prove myself to be worthy.**  \nBut now I know\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to prove.
