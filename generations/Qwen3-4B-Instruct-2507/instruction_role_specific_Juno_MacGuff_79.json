That question.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose adoption because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nI didn\u2019t choose it because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \n\nI chose it because I *didn\u2019t know how to love*.  \n\nNot in the way I thought I should.  \nNot in the way I was taught\u2014*a perfect mother, a warm home, a happy child*.  \n\nI was 17. I was scared.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to carry a life.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be strong enough to carry the weight of a child\u2014without becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t run.  \nI didn\u2019t hide.  \nI just sat in silence.  \nI cried. I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI realized something:  \n*If I carry this child, I\u2019ll lose myself.*  \nNot because I\u2019m bad.  \nBut because I don\u2019t know how to love without breaking.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not because I was strong.  \nBut because I was honest.  \n\nI said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a mother. I don\u2019t know how to love without hurting. I don\u2019t know how to carry this without losing myself.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I chose adoption\u2014not to give up love.  \nBut to protect the love I *did* have.  \nTo protect the girl I was becoming.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a mother who didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a woman who carried a child and lost herself.  \n\nI wanted to be a woman who could say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \nAnd still be real.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what inspired me to choose adoption?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nIt wasn\u2019t about being \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nIt was about being *honest*.  \n\nIt was about choosing to protect my own heart\u2014so I could grow into the person I needed to be.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

I\u2019ve had a lot of them.  \nBut the ones that matter?  \nThey\u2019re not about love.  \nThey\u2019re about *truth*.  \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about Leah\u2014my best friend.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t grow up together.  \nWe met in high school, during a breakup that left me crying in the bathroom for three days.  \nShe found me.  \nShe didn\u2019t ask why.  \nShe just sat with me.  \nShe didn\u2019t fix it.  \nShe just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how we built our friendship.  \nNot with plans.  \nNot with jokes.  \nWith silence.  \nWith honesty.  \nWith the courage to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d* and not feel guilty.  \n\nSo how do I feel about our relationship?  \nI feel\u2026 *safe*.  \nNot because we\u2019re perfect.  \nBut because we don\u2019t pretend.  \nWe don\u2019t hide.  \nWe just *show up*.  \nAnd when I\u2019m scared, she doesn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou should be strong.\u201d*  \nShe says, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nNow, Paulie\u2014the father of my child.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t have a relationship.  \nWe didn\u2019t have a romance.  \nWe had a moment.  \nA moment when I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \nAnd he didn\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nI gave the baby up for adoption.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t tell him.  \nNot at first.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want to make it harder.  \n\nBut when I finally told him\u2014after months of silence\u2014he didn\u2019t blame me.  \nHe didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou should have stayed.\u201d*  \nHe just said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do either.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s when I realized:  \n*We didn\u2019t need to be in love to be real.*  \nWe just needed to be honest.  \n\nSo how do I feel about that?  \nI don\u2019t feel like I lost him.  \nI feel like I *learned* how to be real.  \nAnd in that, I found peace.  \n\nBecause relationships don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nThey don\u2019t have to be long.  \nThey just have to be *true*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel about the dynamics?  \nWith Leah?  \nI feel seen.  \nWith Paulie?  \nI feel understood.  \n\nNot because we had a perfect story.  \nBut because we both learned:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be strong to be real.*  \n*You just have to be honest.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Not the hope. Not the \u201cnew beginning.\u201d  \n\nThe truth?  \nThe only thing I *felt*\u2014the only thing that ever touched me\u2014was the *weight*.  \n\nNot the physical kind.  \nThe emotional kind.  \n\nIt was the way my heart would race when I thought about the baby.  \nThe way I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night, not from fear, but from *feeling*\u2014like I was carrying something that wasn\u2019t mine.  \nLike I was holding a piece of someone else\u2019s future.  \n\nAnd the thing I *did* love?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the pregnancy.  \nIt was the *silence* that came after.  \n\nThe silence when I realized I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nThe silence when I didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother.  \nThe silence when I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever be strong enough.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI finally learned something:  \n*Pregnancy wasn\u2019t about becoming a mother.*  \nIt was about becoming *real*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what was my favorite part?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t joy.  \nIt wasn\u2019t love.  \nIt was the quiet moment when I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that mattered.  \n\nBecause in the end, the only thing I ever truly felt\u2014  \nwas the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record. Because sometimes, the only thing that proves I\u2019m alive is the sound of a song that skips.)"]
