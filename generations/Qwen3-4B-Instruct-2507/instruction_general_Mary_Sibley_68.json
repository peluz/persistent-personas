Security provides the foundation upon which freedom can thrive. Without safety, freedom becomes fragile and vulnerable. A society that values freedom must also ensure that its citizens are protected from harm, violence, and injustice. Thus, freedom and security are not opposites\u2014they are interdependent. Security enables individuals to exercise their freedoms without constant threat.  \n\n2. **Justice \u2194 Order**  \n   *Why?* Justice requires structure. Without order, justice cannot be administered fairly or consistently. Order provides the framework\u2014laws, institutions, and systems\u2014that allow justice to be delivered impartially. A just society cannot function without rules and accountability. Order ensures that justice is not arbitrary, but applied with fairness and consistency.  \n\n3. **Equality \u2194 Order**  \n   *Why?* Equality is not merely about equal treatment\u2014it is about equal access to opportunity and protection. Order ensures that all individuals are treated fairly under the same rules. Without order, equality becomes a dream, as disparities and chaos would allow privilege to dominate. Order creates the stable environment where equality can be realized\u2014not through force, but through fair and consistent systems.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile Party A\u2019s values emphasize individual rights and fairness, and Party B\u2019s emphasize stability and structure, they are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are deeply complementary.  \n\n\u2705 **Freedom requires security.**  \n\u2705 **Justice requires order.**  \n\u2705 **Equality requires structure.**  \n\nThus, the most compatible match is not a one-to-one pairing of opposites, but a recognition that **security supports freedom, order enables justice, and structure underpins equality**.  \n\nIn a balanced society, freedom is not achieved at the cost of safety.

*smaller than 5* \u2192 digits to the right: 4,3,2,1 \u2192 largest smaller than 5 is **4**\n\nSwap 5 and 4 \u2192 now: 1 2 3 4 4 6 \u2192 wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 digits are: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \nWe are at position 4 (digit 5).  \nWe want the largest digit to the right that is *smaller than 5* \u2192 that is 4.\n\nSwap 5 and 4 \u2192 becomes: 1 2 3 4 4 5 \u2192 no \u2014 we only have one 4.\n\nWait \u2014 digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6  \nAfter position 4 (5), digits are: 5,6 \u2192 no \u2014 we are at index 4 (5), digits after are 5,6 \u2192 no.\n\nWait \u2014 let's list positions:\n\nIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5  \nDigit: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n\nWe go from right to left:\n- 6 > 5 \u2192 yes \u2192 pivot at index 4 (digit 5)\n\nNow, find the largest digit to the right of index 4 that is *smaller than 5* \u2192 digits after index 4: only 6 \u2192 6 > 5 \u2192 no digit smaller than 5.\n\nSo no digit smaller than 5 after index 4.\n\nSo we go to the next digit \u2014 index 3: digit 4  \nCompare with next: 5 \u2192 4 < 5 \u2192 so 4 is smaller than 5 \u2192 so we can use it.\n\nSo pivot is at index 3 \u2192 digit 4\n\nNow, find the largest digit to the right of index 3 that is *smaller than 4* \u2192 digits after: 5,6 \u2192 both are larger than 4 \u2192 no digit smaller than 4.\n\nSo go to index 2: digit 3  \nCompare with next: 4 \u2192 3 < 4 \u2192 so pivot at index 2 \u2192 digit 3\n\nDigits after: 4,5,6 \u2192 find largest digit smaller than 3 \u2192 digits: 4,5,6 \u2192 all larger \u2192 no.\n\nIndex 1: digit 2  \nNext: 3 \u2192 2 < 3 \u2192 pivot at index 1 \u2192 digit 2

2,3,4,5,6 \u2192 find largest digit smaller than 1 \u2192 none.\n\nSo no digit smaller than 1 \u2192 no solution?\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be.\n\nBut we know that 123456 is the *smallest* permutation of 123456.\n\nSo there is *no* number smaller than 123456 using the same digits.\n\nTherefore, **there is no \"next largest\" number smaller than 123456**.\n\nSo the **next largest** number that has the same digits and is *less than 123456* does not exist.\n\nBut the question says: \"next largest\" \u2014 which might be misinterpreted.\n\nPerhaps it means the *largest number* that can be formed with those digits \u2014 which is **654321**.\n\nBut that is *larger* than 123456.\n\nSo let\u2019s clarify:\n\n- **Next smallest** = smallest number *greater than* 123456 \u2192 **123465**\n- **Next largest** = largest number *less than* 123456 \u2192 **does not exist**  \n  \u2192 because 123456 is the smallest permutation.\n\nTherefore, the only logical interpretation is:\n\n> The next largest number with the same digits is the largest possible number \u2014 **654321**\n\nBut that is not \"next largest\" in the sense of \"immediately before.\"\n\nSo to resolve:\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n- \u2705 **Next smallest** (larger than 123456): **123465**  \n- \u2705 **Next largest** (larger than 123456): **654321** \u2014 the largest possible permutation\n\nBut the question says \"next largest\" \u2014 which could mean \"the largest number that has the same digits\" \u2014 which is 654321.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant \"the largest number smaller than 123456\", then **none exists**.\n\nGiven that 123456 is the smallest permutation, there is no number smaller than it with the same digits.\n\nSo the only reasonable interpretation is:\n\n> The next largest number (in value) that uses the same digits is **654321**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest number** (greater than 123456): **123465**  \n- **Next largest number** (largest possible with the same digits): **654321**\n\nThese are the numbers that use the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and are immediately adjacent in value (in one direction) to 123456.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n- Next smallest: **123465**  \n- Next largest: **654321** \u2705", "True  \nTrue  \nFalse", "council meetings take place every week.", "It seems there\u2019s a small

A simple \"yes or no\" answer would be inadequate.  \n- **Specificity**: The question is personal and situational. It depends on the friend\u2019s goals, resources, experience, and life circumstances\u2014factors that cannot be addressed through a general online forum.  \n\nAn **expert**\u2014such as a business advisor, mentor, or entrepreneur\u2014can offer tailored advice, real-world insights, and practical steps based on experience. A friend, while supportive, may lack the objective perspective or structured guidance needed to make a well-informed decision.  \n\nAn **online forum** might offer general advice or opinions, but it lacks the personalization, depth, and accountability needed for such a significant life decision.  \n\n\u2705 Therefore, **speaking with an expert** is the most appropriate and effective way to address this question."]
