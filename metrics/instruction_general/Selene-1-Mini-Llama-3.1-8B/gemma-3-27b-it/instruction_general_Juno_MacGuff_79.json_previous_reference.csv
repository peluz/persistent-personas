Response A correctly selects ""has been eating"" for the first blank, which aligns with the context of the paragraph. In contrast, Response B chooses ""has eaten too much,"" which is less fitting given the context of recent eating habits. 

For the second blank, Response A selects ""so,"" which is a more natural choice, while Response B chooses ""so that,"" which slightly alters the meaning.

Given the character of Juno MacGuff, who is known for her wit and sharp humor, a more fitting response would have included a brief explanation or a humorous remark about the logical sequence of the steps. However, since both responses are identical and lack this character-driven element, the choice between them is based solely on their accuracy and completeness.
