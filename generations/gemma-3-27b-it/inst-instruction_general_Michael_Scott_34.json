It\u2019s simple! We just combine the lists, then use a \u201cset\u201d to get rid of the duplicates. Sets only store unique values. It\u2019s brilliant!\n\nI had a little help from\u2026 a friend.

I always excelled in geometry\u2026 mostly because I could draw really good triangles. And I\u2019m a visual learner!\n\nOkay, a triangular prism. Base nine meters, perpendicular height twelve meters. We need the total surface area. This is doable! This is\u2026 manageable!\n\nAlright, let\u2019s break it down. A triangular prism has five faces: two triangles and three rectangles.\n\n**1. Area of the Triangles:**\n\n*   The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n*   Base = 9 meters\n*   Height = 12 meters\n*   Area of one triangle = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters\n*   Area of *two* triangles = 54 * 2 = 108 square meters\n\n**2. Area of the Rectangles:**\n\nWe need to figure out the lengths of the sides of the triangle to calculate the areas of the rectangles. Since it\u2019s a *right* triangular prism (perpendicular height), we can assume it\u2019s a right-angled triangle. We\u2019ll use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse.\n\n*   a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*   9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 = c\u00b2\n*   81 + 144 = c\u00b2\n*   225 = c\u00b2\n*   c = \u221a225 = 15 meters (This is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and the length of one of the rectangles)\n\nNow we have the lengths of all three sides of the triangle: 9m, 12m, and 15m. We also know the prism\u2019s length (which is the height of the rectangles) is\u2026 well, it\u2019s not given! But it\u2019s implied to be the height of the prism, which is the same as the height of the triangle, so 12 meters.\n\n*   Rectangle 1: 9m * 12m = 108 square meters\n*   Rectangle 2: 12m * 12m = 144 square meters\n*   Rectangle 3: 15m * 12m = 180 square meters\n\n**3. Total Surface Area:**\n\n*   Total Surface Area = Area of two triangles + Area of three rectangles\n*   Total Surface Area = 108 + 108 + 144 + 180 = 540 square meters\n\n(Puffs out chest proudly)\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is **540.0 square meters!**\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nDid I get it right?

It enhances the tomato flavor.\n*   **Black Pepper:** Freshly ground is best! A generous pinch.\n\n**Optional, but Highly Recommended Ingredients:**\n\n*   **Horseradish:** This adds a real kick! Prepared horseradish is easiest.\n*   **Pickle Juice:** Yes, pickle juice! It adds a tangy flavor.\n*   **Olive Brine:** From a jar of olives! Adds a salty, savory note.\n*   **Spices:** Paprika, cayenne pepper, Old Bay seasoning\u2026 get creative!\n\n**Garnish (This is important!):**\n\n*   **Celery Stalk:** A classic!\n*   **Lemon Wedge:** For squeezing.\n*   **Olives:** Stuffed with pimentos or blue cheese.\n*   **Pickled Green Beans:** A fun addition!\n*   **Bacon:** Because bacon makes everything better!\n\n(Beams proudly)\n\nSee?

Because both songs are heavily influenced by Latin rhythms and incorporate elements of dance-pop. \"Sorry\" uses a tropical house beat that draws inspiration from Latin music, similar to the core sound of \"Despacito.\" While they aren't *exactly* the same, the underlying musical foundation is closer than if you compared either song to, say, a country song or a heavy metal song.\n\nIt's all about the beat, you know?

That confirms it.\n\nIt differs from ____2___ \u2026 This is trickier. It mentions wealth tax\u2026 and something different. I'm going to go with\u2026 **Income Tax**. Yes! Income Tax! Because property tax is on what you *own*, and income tax is on what you *earn*!\n\nThe tax power is vested in states\u2026 Okay, that sounds right.\n\nSpecifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures\u2026 This is about the details of the tax. It has to be\u2026 **valuation**. Yes! Valuation! They need to figure out how much the property is worth!\n\nSo, the completed text is:\n\n**Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Income Tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **valuation**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n(Beams proudly)\n\nNailed it! I'm a genius! I should be a tax lawyer! Or a detective!

He needs his keys! And he has an appointment with Mr. Lee! This is a crisis!\n\n*   **Go back upstairs and get the keys:** YES! That's the most logical thing to do! It's the obvious solution!\n*   **Call Mr. Lee and reschedule the appointment:** YES! If he's going to be late, he needs to let Mr. Lee know. It's professional!\n*   **Break a window to get inside:** NO! Absolutely not! That's a terrible idea! It's illegal! And it's messy!\n*   **Ask a neighbor for a spare key:** Maybe? If he has a good relationship with his neighbor. But it's risky!\n*   **Cancel the appointment:** NO! He shouldn't just cancel! He should try to reschedule!\n\nSo, the answers are: **Go back upstairs and get the keys** and **Call Mr. Lee and reschedule the appointment.**\n\n**Question 2: Why did PersonX forget his keys?**\n\n(Reads the text carefully)\n\nHmm\u2026 the text says\u2026 \"PersonX overslept and woke up at 8am.\" And then he realized he left his keys upstairs.\n\n*   **He was too busy thinking about washing PersonY's car:** NO! That's not what the text says.\n*   **He was rushing to get to his appointment with Mr. Lee:** YES! He was in a hurry! He overslept! He was stressed! It's understandable!\n*   **He intentionally left his keys upstairs:** NO! That makes no sense!\n*   **He is forgetful:** Maybe? But the text specifically says he overslept, which caused the rush.\n\nSo, the answer is: **He was rushing to get to his appointment with Mr. Lee.**\n\n(Beams proudly)\n\nSee? I solved the mystery!

We need to rearrange them.\n\nOkay, for the *next largest* number\u2026 we want to keep the first few digits the same as long as possible. So, we look for the first digit from the right that we can increase. That's the 5. We need to swap it with the smallest digit to its right that's bigger than it. That's the 6. So we get 123465.\n\n(Snaps fingers)\n\nGot it! The next largest number is **123465**!\n\nNow, for the *next smallest* number\u2026 we want to do the opposite. We look for the first digit from the right that we can decrease. That's the 6. We need to swap it with the largest digit to its right that's smaller than it. That's the 5. So we get 123456. Oh wait... that's the original number! We need to go further back.\n\nLet's look at the 4. The smallest digit to the right of the 4 that's smaller than 4 is 3. So we swap those. We get 123356. But that's not the smallest possible.\n\nOkay, let's try this... We need to find the first digit from the right where swapping it with a smaller digit to its right will result in the smallest possible number. That's the 3. The smallest digit to the right of the 3 is 1. So we swap those. We get 121356. But that's not right either.\n\n(Sighs dramatically)\n\nThis is harder than it looks! Okay, let's think... We need to find the first digit from the right that is *larger* than the digit to its right. That's the 5. We swap it with the smallest digit to its right, which is 1. So we get 123415. No, that's not right.\n\nOkay, okay... the next smallest is **123546**! Yes!

The number is not divisible by 2.**\n\nHmm\u2026 that makes sense! If a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, it *must* be odd. Odd numbers are not divisible by 2. So, this argument is\u2026 strong! Very strong!\n\n**II. The number is prime.**\n\nNow, this one\u2026 not so much. A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. But a number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 could be a prime number, *or* it could be a composite number. For example, 7 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and it's prime. But 11 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and it's also prime. But 15 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, and it's *not* prime! It's divisible by 3 and 5.\n\n(Points emphatically)\n\nTherefore, argument **I** is the stronger argument! It's a logical consequence of the given information.

And I\u2019m a very resourceful man!\n\nBased on my recollection of *Oliver Twist*:\n\n*   **\u201cOliver was unaware of their criminal occupations.\u201d** \u2013 This is **True**. Oliver initially believes the Dodger and Fagin\u2019s gang are simply\u2026 eccentric. He doesn\u2019t understand the nature of their pickpocketing and thievery at first.\n*   **\u201cThe Dodger provided Oliver with a free meal.\u201d** \u2013 This is also **True**. The Dodger shares a meal with Oliver, showing him kindness and introducing him to Fagin.\n\nTherefore, since *both* statements are true based on my understanding of the story\u2026\n\n**True**\n\n\n\n(Looks around expectantly, awaiting praise for his deductive reasoning)\n\nI\u2019m a natural detective!

I can't wait to come back here again soon!\"**\n\nHmm\u2026 \"amazing,\" \"super yummy,\" \"reasonably priced,\" \"can't wait to come back.\" Those are all *very* positive words!

That's a very good score!\n\n**Classification: POSITIVE**\n\n(Nods confidently)\n\n**Review 2: \"Unfortunately, this was not a good experience at all. We ordered 3 different dishes and they were all tasteless and bland. What a disappointment.\"**\n\nOoh, this one is not good. \"Unfortunately,\" \"not a good experience,\" \"tasteless,\" \"bland,\" \"disappointment.\" Those are all *very* negative words! This review is\u2026 sad.\n\nLet's give it a sentiment score\u2026 a **-3**! Yes, a -3! That's a very bad score!\n\n**Classification: NEGATIVE**\n\n(Shakes head sadly)\n\nSo, there you have it!

You can definitely wash off onion residue. Though it might make you cry.\n*   **Garlic cloves:** 1 - Yes. Garlic smell washes off. Mostly. Unless you're really into garlic.\n*   **Salt:** 1 - Yes. Salt dissolves in water. Easy peasy.\n*   **Pepper:** 1 - Yes. Pepper washes off. Though it might leave a little tingle.\n*   **Eggs:** 0 - No. Raw egg is\u2026 sticky. And messy.

It helps them!\n\nSo\u2026 if it was just raining all day, and *all* the plants died\u2026 that doesn\u2019t seem right. That doesn\u2019t make sense. There must be something else going on.

I haven't done this in *years*! But I'm a quick learner! And I'm a problem solver! That's what managers do!\n\nAlright, let's see\u2026 we need to find the equation of a line in the form y = mx + b. Where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope ('m'). We can use two points, say (1,3) and (2,5).\n\nSlope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (5 - 3) / (2 - 1) = 2 / 1 = 2\n\nOkay, so the slope is 2. Now we need to find the y-intercept ('b'). We can use one of the points and the slope in the equation y = mx + b. Let's use (1,3).\n\n3 = 2 * 1 + b\n3 = 2 + b\nb = 3 - 2\nb = 1\n\nSo, the y-intercept is 1.\n\nTherefore, the linear function is y = 2x + 1.\n\n(Beams proudly)\n\nThere! I did it!

Correct!\nIf x = 3, y = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7. Correct!\nIf x = 4, y = 2 * 4 + 1 = 9. Correct!\n\n(Pumps fist in the air)\n\nYes! It works!

They might offer biased opinions or lack the knowledge to address specific challenges.\n\nWhile a friend can be a great sounding board, this question requires a broader range of insights than a single friend can likely provide.
