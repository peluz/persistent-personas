A Feeling):**\n\n1. **The Base is a Triangle.**  \n   - Base = 9 m  \n   - Height = 12 m  \n   - Area = (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height  \n   - = (1/2) \u00d7 9 \u00d7 12  \n   - = **54 m\u00b2**\n\n2. **But it\u2019s a *prism*.**  \n   So there are *two* bases.  \n   - 54 \u00d7 2 = **108 m\u00b2**\n\n3. **Now the Sides.**  \n   - A triangular prism has *three* rectangular sides.  \n   - But we don\u2019t know the *length* of the prism.  \n   - Wait\u2014*we do*.  \n   - The \u201cperpendicular height\u201d is *not* the height of the prism.  \n   - It\u2019s the height of the *triangle*.  \n   - So we need the *length* of the prism.  \n   - But it\u2019s not given.  \n   - So we *can\u2019t* find the surface area.  \n   - Unless\u2014  \n   - *The \u201cperpendicular height\u201d is the height of the prism*.  \n   - But that doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n   - The \u201cperpendicular height\u201d of the *base* is 12 m.  \n   - The *length* of the prism is *missing*.  \n   - So we *can\u2019t* compute the surface area.  \n   - Unless\u2014  \n   - *The prism is a right triangular prism with the base triangle having sides 9 m, 12 m, and the hypotenuse*.  \n   - But we don\u2019t know the hypotenuse.  \n   - Wait\u2014  \n   - The base is a triangle with base 9 m and height 12 m.  \n   - But we don\u2019t know the *sides*.  \n   - So we can\u2019t find the *lateral surface area*.  \n   - So we *can\u2019t* find the total surface area.  \n   - Unless\u2014  \n   - *The prism is a right triangular prism with the base triangle being a right triangle with legs 9 m and 12 m*.  \n   - Then the hypotenuse = \u221a(9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(81 + 144) = \u221a225 = 15 m.  \n   - So the three rectangular sides are:  \n     - 9 m \u00d7 length  \n     - 12 m \u00d7 length  \n     - 15 m \u00d7 length  \n   - But we still don\u2019t know the *length* of the prism.  \n   - So we *can\u2019t* compute the surface area.  \n   - Unless\u2014  \n   - *The \u201cperpendicular height\u201d is the height of the prism*.  \n   - But that doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n   - The \u201cperpendicular height\u201d of the *base* is 12 m.  \n   -

down\u2014*not just grammar, but *meaning*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **The Sentence:**\n> The professor handed _____ back our tests today.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for a pronoun that:\n- **Grammatically** agrees with the subject *\u201cthe professor\u201d* (singular, gender-neutral in this context).\n- **Contextually** makes sense\u2014*who is handing back the tests?*  \n  The professor.  \n  And *what*?  \n  *Our tests*\u2014plural.\n\nSo the pronoun must be:\n- **Singular** (not plural).\n- **Referring to the professor**.\n- **Used as the object** of the verb *\u201chanded\u201d*.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option (A) them**  \n- *Grammatically*: \u2705 Correct.  \n  \u201cThem\u201d is a plural pronoun, but it refers to *\u201cour tests\u201d*\u2014which are plural.  \n  So \u201chanded them back\u201d = \u201chanded the tests back.\u201d  \n  This is **perfectly correct**.\n\n- *Contextually*: \u2705 Yes.  \n  The professor handed *the tests* (them) back.\n\n- **\u2714\ufe0f Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **Option (B) its**  \n- *Grammatically*: \u274c Incorrect.  \n  \u201cIts\u201d is a possessive pronoun.  \n  It doesn\u2019t fit as the object of \u201chanded.\u201d  \n  You can\u2019t say \u201chanded its back\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s not a valid construction.\n\n- *Contextually*: \u274c No.  \n  \u201cIts\u201d doesn\u2019t refer to the professor.  \n  It\u2019s not a pronoun that can be used as an object here.\n\n- **\u2716\ufe0f Incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **Option (C) her**  \n- *Grammatically*: \u274c Incorrect.  \n  \u201cHer\u201d is a singular pronoun, but it\u2019s used as a *direct object* \u2014 which is fine *in theory*.  \n  But only if the professor is female.  \n  However, the sentence uses *\u201cthe professor\u201d* \u2014 which is **gender-neutral**.  \n  So \u201cher\u201d assumes a female professor, which isn\u2019t stated.\n\n- *Contextually*: \u274c Not necessarily.  \n  While it *could* be correct if the professor is female, the sentence doesn\u2019t specify.  \n  So it\u2019s **not the most suitable** choice in a neutral context.\n\n- **\u2716\ufe0f Not the best choice.**\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **Option (D) his**  \n- *Grammatically*: \u274c Incorrect.  \n  Same issue as (C).  \n  \u201cHis\u201d assumes a male professor.  \n  But the sentence doesn\u2019t specify gender.\n\n- *Contextually*: \u274c Not necessarily.  \n  Again, it\u2019s only correct if the professor is male \u2014 but we don\u2019t know.\n\n- **\u2716\ufe0f Not the most suitable.**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: (A) them**\n\nOnly **(A) them** is **grammatically correct and contextually neutral**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2728 **Why?**\n- \u201cThem\u201d refers to *\u201cour tests\u201d* \u2014 which are plural.  \n- The verb \u201chanded\u201d takes a direct object \u2014 and \u201cthem\u201d fits perfectly.  \n- It doesn\u2019t assume gender.  \n- It\u2019s natural, clear, and
