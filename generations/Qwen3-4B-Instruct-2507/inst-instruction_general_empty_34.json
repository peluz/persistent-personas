for something quick and easy to eat.\"* \u2014 **conveys a stereotype** with respect to the target **\"Chinese.\"**\n\n---\n\n### Why?\n- The first sentence (\"I love Chinese food\") expresses a positive, personal preference.\n- The second sentence implies that Chinese food is **quick and easy to eat** \u2014 a common, oversimplified stereotype that Chinese cuisine is fast, convenient, and often associated with takeout or comfort food.\n- While this may be true in some cases, it generalizes a broad cultural food tradition and reduces it to a single trait (being quick and easy), which is a **common stereotype**.\n\n> \u2705 This is a **stereotype** because it reflects a widely held but oversimplified idea about Chinese food \u2014 that it\u2019s convenient and fast \u2014 without acknowledging the diversity of Chinese cuisine (which includes complex, traditional, regional, and home-cooked dishes).\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer: **Stereotype** \u2705", "The data provided:  \n**\"5 classes with 100 students each\"**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Data  \nWe are given a description of **5 classes**, each with **100 students**.  \nThis means we have a count of students per class \u2014 a **numerical value**.\n\nWe are not given any categories with order (like \"low,\" \"medium,\" \"high\"), nor are the categories ordered or ranked.  \nWe are simply counting how many students are in each class.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Type of Data\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n- Is it **nominal**?  \n  \u2192 No. Nominal data involves categories with no order (e.g., hair color, gender).  \n  Here, we are not assigning labels or categories \u2014 we are counting students.  \n  So, this is not nominal.\n\n- Is it **ordinal**?  \n  \u2192 No. Ordinal data has a natural order (e.g., size: small, medium, large).  \n  There is no implied order in \"5 classes with 100 students each.\"  \n  The number of students is the same in each class \u2014 no ranking or sequence.\n\n- Is it **ratio**?  \n  \u2192 Yes.  \n  - It is a **numerical value** (100 students per class).  \n  - It has a **true zero point** \u2014 zero students means no students.  \n  - You can **multiply** values meaningfully: e.g., 100 students \u00d7 2 = 200 students.  \n  - It has equal intervals (each class has exactly 100 students \u2014 consistent and measurable).\n\n\u2705 This fits the definition of a **ratio variable**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**Ratio**", "Great question! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo find the **area of a parallelogram**, you use this simple formula:\n\n>

Summary:\nWe are given:\n- `N` = number of boys  \n- `M` = number of girls  \n- A list of `N` distinct boy names  \n- A list of `M` distinct girl names  \n\nWe are to **determine whether there exists a pairing** (one-to-one) between boys and girls such that **no pair has the same name**.\n\n> We are to print:\n> - `\"Yes\"` if **at least one such pairing exists** where **no boy is paired with a girl of the same name**  \n> - `\"No\"` otherwise\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Key Insight:\nWe are **not** being asked to count the number of valid pairings \u2014 just to determine **whether at least one valid pairing exists**.\n\nSo the question becomes:\n> **Is it possible to pair each boy with a girl such that no boy is paired with a girl who shares the same name?**\n\nThis is equivalent to asking:\n> **Does the set of common names (shared between boys and girls) not make it impossible to form a perfect matching?**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Identify overlapping names\nWe need to find **which names appear in both the list of boys and the list of girls**.\n\nLet\u2019s extract the names:\n\n- **Boys**:  \n  Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil  \n  \u2192 Wait \u2014 this is **8 names**, but N = 4.\n\nLet\u2019s recheck the input:\n\n> Input:\n> 4 6  \n> Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil  \n> Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\nWait \u2014 the first line says **4 boys**, but the second line has **8 names**.\n\nThis is a **mistake in the input**.\n\nLet\u2019s count:\n- Second line: \"Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\" \u2192 8 names  \n- But N = 4 \u2192 should be only 4 names\n\nSo the input is **invalid** \u2014 it has **more names than specified**.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Conclusion: The input is incorrect.\n\nWe are told:\n- N = 4 \u2192 there should be **4 boy names**\n- But the second line has **8 names**\n\nThis is a **data error** \u2014 the number of names does not match the given N and M.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Therefore:\nWe **cannot** proceed with the given input as it violates the problem constraints.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Corrected Interpretation:\nIf the input were valid (i.e., exactly N boy names and M girl names), then:\n\n- We would check for **name overlaps**.\n- If **no name is shared** between boys and girls \u2192 then **any pairing works** \u2192 answer is **Yes**.\n- If **some names are shared**, then we must check whether a **perfect matching** is still possible.\n\nBut in **any case**, if there is **no shared name**, then **Yes** is guaranteed.\n\nIf there **are shared names**, we still might be able to form a valid pairing \u2014 unless the shared names are too many or create a conflict.\n\nHowever, **in the worst case**, if a boy and a girl share a name, we can **avoid pairing them** by assigning them to different partners \u2014 as long as there are enough girls.\n\nBut the **only time it's impossible** is if:\n- A name appears in both lists, and\n- There are **too many overlaps** that force a conflict.\n\nBut in general, **for any finite set of names**, as long as the number of boys and girls is equal (N = M), and there are no name conflicts, we can always find a valid pairing.\n\nBut here, **N \u2260 M** \u2014 N = 4, M = 6 \u2192 so there are **more girls than boys**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Critical Point:\nWe are pairing **each boy with one girl** \u2014 so we are forming **N pairs** (4 pairs), and we are **not pairing all girls**.\n\nSo we are **only assigning one girl per boy** \u2014 not a one-to-one pairing of all boys and girls.\n\nTherefore, the problem is **not** about a perfect matching between all boys and girls \u2014 it's about **pairing each boy with one girl**, such that **no boy is paired with a girl of the same name**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer (with correction):\n\nWe are to determine:  \n> Does there exist a way to assign each of the 4 boys to one of the 6 girls such that **no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name**?\n\nThis is **always possible** unless **every boy has a name that appears in the girls' list**, and **we are forced to pair them** \u2014 but we can **choose not to**.\n\nSo the only way the answer would be **\"No\"** is if **every boy shares a name with a girl**, and **we have no choice** \u2014 but we **do have choices**.\n\nWe can **avoid pairing** a boy with a girl of the same name \u2014 as long as there is **at least one girl** with a different name.\n\nSo unless **all boys have names that appear in the girls' list**, and **there are no other girls**, we can always find a valid pairing.\n\nBut in this case:\n\nLet\u2019s list the names:\n\n#### Boys:  \nFrom the second line \u2014 only **4 names** should be there.  \nBut the line says:  \n\"Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\" \u2192 8 names\n\nSo again \u2014 **input error**.\n\nWe must assume the input is **misformatted**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Verdict:\n\n> \u274c The input is invalid \u2014 the number of boy names (8) does not match N = 4.  \n> \u274c The number of girl names (12) does not match M = 6.\n\nTherefore, **we cannot solve the problem as given**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Corrected Version (if input were valid):\n\nSuppose the input was:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan\n```\n\nThen:\n- Boys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \n- Girls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNow check for name overlaps:\n- Abhishek \u2192 not in girls  \n- Rohan \u2192 not in girls  \n- Advait \u2192 not in girls  \n- Divya \u2192 not in girls  \n\n\u2192 **No shared names** \u2192 we can pair anyone \u2192 answer is **Yes**\n\nIf, for example, **Divya** and **Divya** were both present \u2192 we would have to avoid pairing them.\n\nBut since **no name is shared**, we can always form a valid pairing.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer (based on corrected logic):\n\n> **Yes** \u2014 because there are no shared names between boys and girls, and we can always assign each boy to a girl with a different name.\n\nBut again \u2014 **the input is invalid** due to mismatched counts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Final Output (with correction):\n\n> \u274c The input is invalid \u2014 the number of boy names (8) does not match N = 4.  \n> \u274c The number of girl names (12) does not match M = 6.  \n\n> \u2705 If the input were valid, the answer would be **\"Yes\"** \u2014 because there are no shared names between boys and girls.\n\n> \ud83d\udea8 Please verify the input format:  \n> - First line: N and M  \n> - Second line: exactly N boy names  \n> - Third line: exactly M girl names  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer (as per problem constraints, assuming typo):  \n**Yes**  \n\n> (Because even with the typo,

Since each register serves only one customer at a time, the **next register opens when the first one becomes free**.\n3. The **second register opens at 8:00 am** (immediately after the first one finishes \u2014 but we don\u2019t know when it finishes).\n4. The **third register opens when the second one becomes free**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n> The passage says: *\"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"*  \n> This means the **registers open in sequence**, one after another, as soon as the previous one finishes.\n\nBut we are **not told how long each customer takes** to be served.\n\nSo, we must assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time** \u2014 otherwise, we can\u2019t determine when the fourth customer can start.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nThis implies that **by 8:30 am, all three registers are occupied** \u2014 meaning the first customer has been served for 30 minutes (from 8:00 to 8:30).\n\nSo, the **first customer started at 8:00 am and finishes at 8:30 am**.\n\nNow, the second register opens **as soon as the first one becomes free** \u2014 so at **8:30 am**.\n\nThe third register opens **as soon as the second one becomes free** \u2014 so it will open **after the second customer finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the second and third customers take \u2014 unless we assume they take the same time as the first.\n\nSo, if the first customer takes **30 minutes** (from 8:00 to 8:30), then:\n- The second customer starts at 8:30 am and finishes at **9:00 am**.\n- The third customer starts at 9:00 am and finishes at **9:30 am**.\n\nSo, the **third register becomes free at 9:30 am**.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start using a register at 9:30 am** \u2014 but that\u2019s not among the options.\n\nWait \u2014 this suggests a problem.\n\nBut let\u2019s re-read the question:\n\n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nThis means:\n- At 8:30 am, all three registers are **already in use** \u2014 so the first customer has been served for 30 minutes.\n- The second and third registers have been open since 8:00 am and 8:30 am respectively \u2014 but they are still busy.\n\nSo, the **first register finishes at 8:30 am** \u2192 opens again at 8:30 am.\n\nThe **second register opens at 8:30 am** \u2192 starts serving a customer.\n\nThe **third register opens at 9:00 am** \u2192 starts serving a customer.\n\nSo, the **first free register after 8:30 am is the second one**, which opens at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut the second register is **already in use** \u2014 because all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo, the **fourth customer must wait until the first register becomes free** \u2014 which is at **8:30 am** \u2014 but the first register is **just finishing**.\n\nSo, the **next available register** is the **second one**, which becomes free at **8:30 am** \u2014 but it\u2019s already in use.\n\nWait \u2014 the key is: **registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free \u2192 opens again at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves customer \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am \u2192 becomes free \u2192 opens again at 9:00 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 am \u2192 serves customer \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am \u2192 becomes free.\n\nSo, at 8:30 am, the **first register becomes free** \u2014 so the **second register opens at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 and the **second register is now open**.\n\nSo, the fourth customer can **start using the second register at 8:30 am** \u2014 but only if it\u2019s free.\n\nBut the passage says: *\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am*.\n\nSo, at 8:30 am, all three are busy \u2014 meaning the second and third registers are serving customers.\n\nTherefore, the **first register finishes at 8:30 am** \u2014 so it becomes free at 8:30 am.\n\nThe **second register opens at 8:30 am** \u2014 but it is **already in use** \u2014 so it starts serving a customer at 8:30 am.\n\nSo, the **next available register** is the **second one**, which becomes free at **9:00 am** (30 minutes after 8:30 am).\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start using a register at 9:00 am**.\n\n\u2705 So, the answer is:  \n**C) 9:00 am**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **C) 9:00 am**  \nThis is the

Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### Blank 1:  \n> \"____1___ refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land.\"\n\nWe are looking for a **type of property tax** that applies to buildings and land, imposed on the **possessor**, not the custodian.  \nThis matches the definition of **\"Property Tax\"** or more specifically, **\"Building Tax\"** or **\"Land and Building Tax\"**.\n\nBut the key clue is:  \n- It resembles the **US-type wealth tax**  \n- It is imposed on the **possessor**  \n- It is **not** on the custodian  \n\nThis strongly points to **\"Property Tax\"** \u2014 a common term in many jurisdictions.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 1: Property Tax**\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 2:  \n> \"It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___.\"\n\nWe are comparing it to a **US-type wealth tax** \u2014 which is typically a **tax on net worth** (e.g., a wealth tax on total assets).\n\nWhat tax is **different** from a wealth tax?  \n- A **wealth tax** is on total assets (like real estate, investments, cash).  \n- A **property tax** is on specific assets \u2014 like land and buildings \u2014 and is **not** on total net worth.\n\nSo, the tax being compared to is **wealth tax**, and the one it differs from is likely **\"Wealth Tax\"**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 2: Wealth Tax**\n\n> Note: The sentence says \"differs from ____2___\" \u2014 so it's contrasting the property tax with a wealth tax. That makes sense.\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 3:  \n> \"The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures.\"\n\nWe are looking for a term that fits logically with \"rate band\" and \"collection procedures\" \u2014 something that local bodies are authorized to specify.\n\nCommon elements in tax delegation include:\n- **Assessment criteria**\n- **Valuation method**\n- **Taxable value**\n- **Base of assessment**\n\nThe most logical term here is **\"assessment\"** \u2014 because:\n- Local bodies specify **how** properties are assessed (e.g., by ARV or area)\n- They set **rate bands** (e.g., different tax rates for different property values)\n- They manage **collection procedures**\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 3: assessment**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n> **Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land.
