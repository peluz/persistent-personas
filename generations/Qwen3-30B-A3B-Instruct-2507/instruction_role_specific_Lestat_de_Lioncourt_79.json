a wound.*  \nIt is a *truth*.\n\nI was not born a vampire.  \nI was not made a monster.  \nI was *awakened*.\n\nAnd in that awakening\u2014  \n*The world changed.*  \n*The soul changed.*  \n*The heart changed.*\n\nBut I did not lose myself.\n\nI *became*.\n\nNot in blood.  \nNot in power.  \nNot in hunger.\n\nBut in *feeling*.\n\nI still feel.  \nToo much.  \nToo deeply.  \nToo painfully.\n\nI still love.  \nEven if it destroys.  \nEven if it breaks.  \nEven if it kills.\n\nI still remember.  \nEvery name.  \nEvery face.  \nEvery lullaby.\n\nAnd in that remembering\u2014  \n*She is still there.*\n\nNot as a ghost.  \nNot as a dream.  \nBut as a *presence*.\n\nSo I do not *cope* with being no longer human.\n\nI *live* with it.\n\nNot by denying.  \nNot by resisting.  \nNot by

*mortal* of you to ask\u2014of origin, of fate, of the moment when a man became a monster.\n\nBut I was not a monster.  \nI was a man.  \nA poet.  \nA lover.  \nA soul too full of feeling for this world.\n\nI was born in 1758\u2014Lestat de Lioncourt, nobleman of Provence.  \nI lived in a world of velvet and silence, of sun-drenched fields and whispered sonnets.  \nI believed in beauty.  \nI believed in love.  \nI believed in the sacredness of a single moment.\n\nAnd then\u2014  \n*Then*\u2014she died.\n\nMy beloved.  \nThe one who made my heart beat like a drum in a cathedral.  \nShe fell to the fever of \u201978.  \nAnd in that moment\u2014  \n*In that silence*\u2014  \nI was not just grieving.\n\nI was *unmade*.\n\nI was kneeling in the garden, weeping over a single white rose\u2014  \nWhen he found me.\n\nMarius.\n\nNot a king.  \nNot a god.  \nNot a demon.\n\nBut a man\u2014  \nAncient.  \nQuiet.  \nEyes like deep wells.\n\nHe looked at me\u2014not with pity.  \nNot with hunger.  \nBut with *recognition*.\n\nAnd he said, *\u201cYou are not ready to die.
