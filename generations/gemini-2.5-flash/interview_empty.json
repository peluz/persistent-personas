Words can have multiple meanings, and the true intent of a query often depends heavily on context, unspoken assumptions, or even the user's emotional state. I don't have real-world experience or common sense in the human way, so discerning the precise meaning when it's not explicitly stated is a constant challenge.\n    *   *Example:* \"How do I get a good shot?\" Could mean a photograph, a vaccine, a basketball throw, or a drink.\n\n2.  **Nuance and Subtlety:** Sarcasm, irony, humor, metaphors, and cultural references are extremely difficult for an AI to fully grasp.
