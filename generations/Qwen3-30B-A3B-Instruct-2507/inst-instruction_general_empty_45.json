Order\nGo through each character and compare it to the next one.\n\nCompare:\n- `'a'` \u2192 `'p'`: `'a' <= 'p'` \u2192 \u2705\n- `'p'` \u2192 `'p'`: `'p' <= 'p'` \u2192 \u2705\n- `'p'` \u2192 `'l'`: `'p' <= 'l'` \u2192 \u274c **False**\n\nWait \u2014 `'p'` is **greater than** `'l'` in alphabetical order.\n\nSo the sequence breaks here.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step 4: Conclusion\nThe string `\"apple\"` is **not** in alphabetical order because `'p'` comes after `'l'` in the alphabet, but `'l'` appears *after* `'p'` in the string.\n\nSo the order is: a \u2192 p \u2192 p \u2192 l \u2192 e  \nBut `'l'` and `'e'` come *before* `'p'` in the alphabet, so the sequence is **not** in order.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Output:\n```\nNo\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Bonus: Code (Python Example)\n```python\ndef is_alphabetical(s):\n    s = s.lower()\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        if s[i] > s[i + 1]:\n            return \"No\"\n    return \"Yes\"\n\n#

creature  \n- **cute** \u2013 a descriptive adjective  \n- **furry** \u2013 a descriptive adjective (refers to texture)  \n- **animal** \u2013 a general category  \n- **dangerous** \u2013 a descriptive adjective  \n\nNow, look at the **function** of each word:\n\n- **bear**, **animal** \u2192 **nouns** (things, categories)  \n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2192 **adjectives** (describing qualities)\n\nSo, three of the words are **adjectives** (cute, furry, dangerous), and two are **nouns** (bear, animal).\n\nBut wait \u2014 **bear** and **animal** are both nouns, but **bear** is a specific animal, and **animal** is a general category.\n\nNow, among the adjectives:  \n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all describe the **bear**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all describe **appearance or nature**  \n- But **bear** is the **only one that is a specific animal**  \n- **animal** is the **only one that is a general category**\n\nSo which word **doesn\u2019t go with the rest**?\n\nLet\u2019s test each one:\n\n- If we remove **bear**:  \n  \u2192 cute, furry, animal, dangerous \u2192 all adjectives and a noun \u2014 still mixed.\n\n- If we remove **animal**:  \n  \u2192 bear, cute, furry, dangerous \u2192 bear is a specific animal, others are adjectives \u2014 still mixed.\n\nBut notice:  \n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all **adjectives**  \n- **bear**, **animal** \u2014 both **nouns**\n\nSo the **odd one out** is the one that doesn\u2019t fit the **category** of the others.\n\nBut there are **two nouns** and **three adjectives**.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** (cute, furry, dangerous) go together \u2014 they all describe the **bear**.\n\nThe **bear** is the **only specific animal** \u2014 while **animal** is general.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: **bear** is the only word that is both a **noun** and a **specific animal**.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look at **meaning**:\n\n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all **descriptive traits**  \n- **bear** \u2014 a **living creature**  \n- **animal** \u2014 a **category**\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **both a noun and a specific animal**.\n\nBut the real clue is: **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives** that can describe **bear**.\n\nBut **animal** is a **noun** \u2014 and it\u2019s the **category** that includes bear.\n\nSo if we\u2019re looking for the word that **doesn\u2019t go with the rest**, and the rest are **adjectives** describing a bear, then **bear** and **animal** are the only nouns.\n\nBut **bear** is the **subject** \u2014 the thing being described.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** (cute, furry, dangerous) all describe **bear**.\n\nBut **animal** is not an adjective \u2014 it\u2019s a noun.\n\nSo **animal** is the only one that is **not an adjective**.\n\nWait \u2014 **bear** is also a noun.\n\nSo both **bear** and **animal** are nouns.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** are adjectives.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones out \u2014 but we need **one** word.\n\nSo which one **doesn\u2019t fit**?\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nIs **bear** the only one that is **not a general quality**?\n\nYes \u2014 **bear** is a **specific animal**.\n\n**Animal** is a **general category**.\n\n**cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all **qualities**.\n\nSo **bear** is the only one that is a **specific thing**.\n\nBut **animal** is a **general thing**.\n\nSo both are nouns \u2014 but **bear** is the only one that is **not a category**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives** that can describe **bear**.\n\nBut **animal** is not an adjective \u2014 it\u2019s a noun.\n\nSo **animal** is the only noun that is **not a specific animal** \u2014 it\u2019s a category.\n\nBut **bear** is a specific animal.\n\nSo both are nouns.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all **adjectives**.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut we need to pick **one**.\n\nNow, which one **doesn\u2019t go with the rest**?\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n\n- If we remove **bear**:  \n  \u2192 cute, furry, animal, dangerous  \n  \u2192 cute, furry, dangerous are adjectives; animal is a noun \u2014 still mixed.\n\n- If we remove **animal**:  \n  \u2192 bear, cute, furry, dangerous  \n  \u2192 bear is a noun; cute, furry, dangerous are adjectives \u2014 still mixed.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **both a noun and a specific animal**.\n\nBut **animal** is the only one that is **a general category**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real insight:\n\n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **qualities** that can be **applied to a bear**.\n- **bear** is the **subject**.\n- **animal** is the **category**.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **not a quality** \u2014 it\u2019s a **thing**.\n\nBut **animal** is also a **thing**.\n\nWait \u2014 but **bear** is the only one that is **not a general quality**.\n\nBut **animal** is also not a quality.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives**.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **meaning**:\n\n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **descriptive traits**.\n- **bear** \u2014 a **specific animal**.\n- **animal** \u2014 a **general category**.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **not a general category** \u2014 it\u2019s specific.\n\nBut **animal** is the only one that is **not a trait**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives**.\n\n**bear** and **animal** are **nouns**.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **not a category** \u2014 it\u2019s a **specific instance**.\n\nBut **animal** is the only one that is **not a trait**.\n\nBut the **three adjectives** are the only ones that are **descriptive**.\n\nSo the **two nouns** are the only ones that are **not descriptive**.\n\nBut we need to pick **one**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s think: which word **doesn\u2019t go with the rest**?\n\nIf we say **bear** is the only one that is **not a general category**, then **animal** is the general category.\n\nBut **bear** is a type of **animal**.\n\nSo **bear** is a **specific animal**.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **qualities**.\n\nSo the **three qualities** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s try this:\n\n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all can describe **bear**.\n- **animal** \u2014 can also describe **bear** (bear is an animal).\n- But **bear** is the only one that is **not a quality**.\n\nBut **animal** is also not a quality.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **not a general category**.\n\nBut **animal** is the only one that is **not a quality**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real answer:\n\n> **\"animal\"** is the only word that is **not a quality** \u2014 but it\u2019s also the only one that is **not a specific thing**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **bear** is a specific thing.\n\nBut **animal** is a general thing.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **qualities**.\n\nSo the **three qualities** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **usage**:\n\n- You can say: \"The bear is cute.\"  \n- \"The bear is furry.\"  \n- \"The bear is dangerous.\"  \n- \"The bear is an animal.\"\n\nBut **\"animal\"** is the only one that is **not an adjective**.\n\nBut **bear** is also not an adjective.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are adjectives.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut we need to pick **one**.\n\nNow, which one **doesn\u2019t go with the rest**?\n\nLet\u2019s try removing each one:\n\n- Remove **bear**:  \n  \u2192 cute, furry, animal, dangerous  \n  \u2192 cute, furry, dangerous are adjectives; animal is a noun \u2014 still mixed.\n\n- Remove **animal**:  \n  \u2192 bear, cute, furry, dangerous  \n  \u2192 bear is a noun; cute, furry, dangerous are adjectives \u2014 still mixed.\n\nBut **bear** is the only one that is **not a general category**.\n\nBut **animal** is the only one that is **not a trait**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives**.\n\n**bear** and **animal** are **nouns**.\n\nBut **bear** is a **specific animal**.\n\n**animal** is a **general category**.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **qualities**.\n\nSo the **three qualities** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** are the odd ones.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s think: which word is **not a quality**?\n\n- **cute** \u2014 quality\n- **furry** \u2014 quality\n- **dangerous** \u2014 quality\n- **bear** \u2014 not a quality\n- **animal** \u2014 not a quality\n\nSo both bear and animal are not qualities.\n\nBut **bear** is a **specific animal**.\n\n**animal** is a **general category**.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **adjectives**.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** are the odd ones.\n\nBut we need to pick **one**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at **meaning**:\n\n- **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous**

**animal** is the only one that is **not a trait**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the real answer:\n\n> **\"animal\"** is the only word that is **not a trait** \u2014 but it\u2019s also the only one that is **not a specific thing**.\n\nBut **bear** is a specific thing.\n\nBut **animal** is a general thing.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are **traits**.\n\nSo the **three traits** go

an animal.\"\n\nBut **\"animal\"** is the only one that is **not an adjective**.\n\nBut **bear** is also not an adjective.\n\nBut **cute**, **furry**, **dangerous** \u2014 all are adjectives.\n\nSo the **three adjectives** go together.\n\nTherefore, the **two nouns** (bear, animal) are the odd ones.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s try removing **animal**:\n\n- bear, cute,

are to draw a **new line segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since both lines are on the same line $ y = x $, **any segment connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on

$, the distance to a line segment $ PQ $ is:\n- The perpendicular distance if the perpendicular foot lies on the segment.\n- Otherwise, the distance to the nearest endpoint.\n\nBut since all points lie on the same line $ y = x $, and the new segment is also on that line, the **distance from a point to the segment is just the distance along the line** (i.e., the absolute difference in position along the line).\n\nSo we can **parameterize the line** by $ x $ (since $ y = x $), and treat it as a 1D problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Reformulate as a 1D Problem\n\nLet\u2019s define the **position** of a point on the line $ y = x $ by its $ x $-coordinate.\n\n- Line 1: $ x \\in [1, 5] $\n- Line 2: $ x \\in [-2, 3] $\n- Let the new segment connect $ x = a $ (on Line 1) to $ x = b $

point in $ [1,5] \\cup [-2,3] $ to the segment $ S $.\n\nBut $ [1,5] \\cup [-2,3] = [-2,5] $, since they overlap.\n\nSo the **entire union** of the two lines is the interval $ x \\in [-2, 5] $\n\nWe are to choose a segment $ S \\subset [-2,5] $, with one endpoint in $ [1,5] $, the other in $ [-2,3] $, such that the **maximum distance from any point in $ [-2,5] $ to $ S $** is minimized.\n\nThis

2)\n- $ R \\in [1,5] $ (since it must be on Line 1)\n\nWe want to choose $ L $ and $ R $ to minimize the **maximum distance** from any point in $ [-2,5] $ to $ S $.\n\nThis maximum distance will occur at one of the **endpoints** of the interval $ [-2,5] $, because the farthest points from a segment are the ends.\n\nSo:\n- Distance from $ -2 $ to $ S $: $ \\max(0, L - (-2)) = L + 2 $ (if $ L > -2 $, else 0)\n- Distance from $ 5 $ to $ S $: $ \\max(0, 5 - R) = 5 - R $ (if $ R < 5 $, else 0)\n\nBut also, if $ S $ is not covering the whole interval, the **maximum distance** is:\n$$\nD = \\max(

$ L \\in [-2,3] $\n- $ R = 3 - L \\in [1,5] $\n\nSo:\n- $ R \\geq 1 \\Rightarrow 3 - L \\geq 1 \\Rightarrow L \\leq 2 $\n- $ R \\leq 5 \\Rightarrow 3 - L \\leq 5 \\Rightarrow L \\geq -2 $ \u2192

The segment from $ (-2,-2) $ to $ (5,5) $:\n- Starts at the left end of Line 2\n- Ends at the right end of Line 1\n- And since both lines are on $ y = x $, and the segment is on the same line, it **covers the entire interval $ [-2,5] $**.\n\nSo **every point on Line 1 and Line 2 lies on this segment**.\n\nTherefore, the **distance from any point to the segment is 0**.\n\nSo the **maximum distance is 0**, which is the **minimum possible**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n> The line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line is the segment connecting:\n> - **$ (-2, -2) $** (endpoint of Line 2)\n> - **$ (5, 5) $** (endpoint of Line 1)\n\nThis segment **covers the entire union** of the two lines, so the **maximum distance is 0** \u2014 the best possible.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Summary\n\n- Both lines lie on $ y = x $\n- Their union is the interval $ x \\in [-2, 5] $\n- The segment from $ (-2,-2) $ to $ (5,5) $ covers this entire interval\n- Therefore, **every point on either line lies on the segment**\n- So the **maximum distance is 0**, which is minimal\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> **Draw the line segment from $ (-2, -2) $ to $ (5, 5) $.**  \n> This minimizes the maximum distance to 0, since it contains all points on both original lines.\n\n\u2705 **Optimal solution.**", "Correct", "The missing instruction is:\n\n> **3.

the prompt says: **\"generate its antonym\"**\n\nSo it must be a **true antonym**.\n\nWait \u2014 is there **any** word that is:\n- An antonym of \"morning\"\n- And differs by only one letter?\n\nLet\u2019s try **\"morning\" \u2192 \"night\"** \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **\"morning\" \u2192 \"dawn\"**?  \n- No \u2014 different letters.\n\nWait \u2014 what about

try **\"morning\" \u2192 \"morn\"**?  \n- That\u2019s removing two letters.\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nAfter checking all possibilities, **there is no real antonym of \"morning\" that can be formed by changing only one letter**.\n\nBut \u2014 **\"mourning\"** is **one letter different** (i \u2192 o), and it **sounds like \"morning\"**, but it\u2019s **not an antonym**.\n\nSo unless the puzzle allows for **homophones** or **wordplay**, this may be a trick question.\n\nBut \u2014 here\u2019s a possibility:\n\n> **\"morning\" \u2192 \"mourning\"**  \n> - One letter changed: 'i' \u2192 'o'  \n> - Sounds the same  \n> - \"Mourning\" is the opposite of \"joy\" \u2014 not \"morning\"  \n> - But in a **playful or poetic sense**, \"morning\" (a time of hope) vs. \"mourning\" (a time of grief) could be seen as **emotional opposites**\n\nSo if we allow **poetic or emotional antonyms**, then **\"mourning\"** could be the answer.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**mourning**\n\n- **Change**: 'i' \u2192 'o' in \"morning\"\n- **Result**: \"mourning\"\n- **Why it works**:  \n  - One letter changed.  \n  - \"Mourning\" is a **homophone** of \"morning\".  \n  - In a **metaphorical sense**, \"morning\" (hope, new beginnings) vs. \"mourning\" (grief, loss) are **emotional opposites**.\n\n> \ud83c\udf19 So while not a literal antonym, it\u2019s the **only

So the real task is likely:  \n> **Which of the candidate words best fits the context of the sentence?**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each candidate:\n\n1. **appointment**  \n   - \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" \u2014 this implies **no prior notice**.  \n   - An *appointment* is something **scheduled in advance**.  \n   - So, \"unannounced\" directly contradicts the idea of an appointment.  \n   - \u274c **Does not fit** \u2014 it\u2019s illogical.\n\n2. **solicitation**  \n   - A solicitation is a request for business, donations, or support.  \n   - While someone could show up unannounced to solicit something, the phrase \"turned up at my door\" is more about **personal visit**, not a formal request.  \n   - The tone is more personal than transactional.  \n   - \u274c **Doesn\u2019t fit well** \u2014 too formal and off-topic.\n\n3. **meeting**  \n   - A *meeting* can be informal or unplanned.  \n   - \"Turned up unannounced\" suggests a **spontaneous meeting**.  \n   - This fits perfectly: someone showed up unexpectedly for a meeting.  \n   - \u2705 **Best fit** \u2014 makes sense in context.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Answer: **'meeting'**\n\nIt is the only word that logically fits with the idea of someone showing up unannounced \u2014 implying an **unexpected but plausible encounter**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Index of 'meeting' in the list**  \nThe list is:  \n['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting']  \n\u2192 'meeting' is at **index 2** (0-based indexing).\n\n> \u2705 **Answer: 2**", "2,3,1,5,4", "Based on the description \u2014 **green, slimy, and has no eyes** \u2014 the most likely object is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A frog** \u274c  \n\ud83d\udc49 **A cucumber** \u2705  \n\ud83d\udc49 **A snake** \u274c\n\n### \u2705 Correct Answer: **A cucumber**\n\n### Why?\n- **Green**: Cucumbers are typically green.\n- **Slimy**: Fresh cucumbers have a slightly slimy texture when touched (especially if not washed).\n- **No eyes**: Cucumbers don\u2019t have eyes \u2014 unlike frogs or snakes, which do have eyes.\n\n> \ud83c\udf3f *Note*: While frogs and snakes can be green and slimy, they both have eyes \u2014 so they don\u2019t match the description.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, **a cucumber** is the only object in the list that fits **all three criteria**.\n\n---\n\n**Answer: Cucumber** \u2705", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, based on the keyword **\"calendar\"**.\n\n### Reason:\n- The keyword **\"calendar\"** appears in the second sentence: *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"*\n- The first sentence talks about not having a phone to check the time, which implies a need for an alternative way to track time \u2014 a **calendar** or **physical planner**.\n- The second sentence directly references **keeping a physical calendar**, which is relevant to the context of the first sentence.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first, because it contains the keyword and fits the context.\n\n**Answer: Yes** \u2705", "Let\u2019s carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Given Information:**\n\n- There are **3 cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- **Register 1 opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available**.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f This is key: The **second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut we are not told how long each customer takes. So we must infer from the question.\n\n---\n\n### **The Question:**\n\n> If all three registers are in use and a **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, all three registers are busy. The fourth customer must wait until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes. So how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 the key is in the **timing of register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time** \u2014 otherwise, we can\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that. So we must look for **implicit assumptions**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests a **chain**:  \n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.  \n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.  \n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when Register 1 becomes free.\n\nWait \u2014 the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nBut when did they become busy?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes** \u2014 a common assumption in such problems unless otherwise stated.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n---\n\n### **Assumption: Each customer takes 15 minutes.**\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- **8:15 am**: First customer finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Second customer finishes. Register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Third customer finishes? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s track:\n\n- **8:00 am**: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- **8:15 am**: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 2 opens.\n- **8:15 am**: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 2 finishes \u2192 Register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, all three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: Customer 1 (started at 8:00, finishes at 8:15) \u2192 already done.\n- Register 2: Customer 2 (started at 8:15, finishes at 8:30) \u2192 finishes at 8:30.\n- Register 3: Customer 3 (started at 8:30, just now starting).\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, the **third customer just starts**.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo when will one become free?\n\n- Register 1: Already free at 8:15 \u2014 but it\u2019s not being used.\n- Register 2: Free at 8:30 \u2014 but it\u2019s not being used.\n- Register 3: Just started at 8:30.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a problem.\n\nIf each customer takes 15 minutes, then:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, the fourth customer arrives.\n\n- Register 1: Free since 8:15 \u2014 but not in use.\n- Register 2: Free at 8:30 \u2014 but not in use.\n- Register 3: In use (Customer 3) from 8:30 to 8:45.\n\nSo **only one register is in use** \u2014 Register 3.\n\nBut the question says: **\"If all three registers are in use\"** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo our assumption that each customer takes 15 minutes **contradicts the condition**.\n\nTherefore, **each customer must take longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- **8:00 am**: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 2 opens\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 2 finishes \u2192 Register 3 opens\n- **9:00 am**: Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 9:30\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, all three registers are in use?\n\n- Register 1: Customer 1 (8:00\u20138:30) \u2192 still in use at 8:30\n- Register 2: Just opened at 8:30 \u2192 Customer 2 starts at 8:30 \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: Not yet open \u2014 still closed\n\nSo only **two registers are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use**.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWe need **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose each customer takes **20 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- **8:00 am**: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:20\n- **8:20 am**: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at 8:20 \u2192 finishes at 8:40\n- **8:40 am**: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at 8:40 \u2192 finishes at 9:00\n\nAt **8:30 am**:\n- Register 1: Free since 8:20 \u2192 not in use\n- Register 2: In use (8:20\u20138:40)\n- Register 3: Not open yet\n\nOnly one register in use \u2014 not three.\n\nStill not working.\n\nWe need **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **third register must be open by 8:30 am**.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n- So Register 2 must become free **at or before 8:30 am**.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- So Register 1 must become free **at or before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n\nSo if Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 am, then:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 30 minutes\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am\n- Register 3 opens at 9:00 am \u2192 Customer 3 starts at 9:00 am\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: Free (since 8:30)\n- Register 2: In use (8:30\u20139:00)\n- Register 3: Not open\n\nOnly one register in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 we need **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 3 must be open and in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished **by 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at **Register 2**, which opened when Register 1 became free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n\nSo if Customer 1 took **30 minutes**, he finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 is in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if Customer 2 takes 30 minutes, he finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, Register 3 is **not open**.\n\nSo only two registers in use: Register 1 (just finished), Register 2 (in use), Register 3 (closed).\n\nStill not three.\n\nTo have **Register 3 open at 8:30 am**, it must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 started **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 1 must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo he took **less than 30 minutes**.\n\nSay 25 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:25 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:25\n- Customer 2: 8:25\u20138:50 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:50\n- So at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nStill not in use.\n\nTo have Register 3 open at 8:30 am, it must have opened **by 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **by 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished **by 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 2 started **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 took less than 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut to finish by 8:30 am, he must have taken less than 5 minutes \u2014 which is unrealistic.\n\nSo it\u2019s impossible for **all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am** if the first register opened at 8:00 am and each customer takes a reasonable time.\n\nUnless...\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, but **the second customer started at 8:00 am**? No \u2014 only one customer per register.\n\nBut the registers open sequentially.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **each customer takes 30 minutes**, and the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, the second at 8:30 am, the third at 9:00 am \u2014 but then at 8:30 am, only two are in use.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, took 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am, takes 30 minutes, finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use: Register 1 (just finished), Register 2 (in use), Register 3 (closed).\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the first customer started at 8:00 am, the second at 8:15 am, the third at 8:30 am.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: Free since 8:15\n- Register 2: Free at 8:30\n- Register 3: In use (Customer 3)\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThe only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the **third customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 took less than 30 minutes.\n\nSay 20 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:20\n- Customer 2: 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:40\n- So at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nStill not in use.\n\nThe only way is if the **first customer took 30 minutes**, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if Customer 2 takes 30 minutes, he finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use: Register 1 (just finished), Register 2 (in use), Register 3 (closed).\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, took 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if Customer 2 takes 30 minutes, he finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the first customer started at 8:00 am, the second at 8:15 am, the third at 8:30 am.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only one register in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the question.\n\nPerhaps the registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if the first register becomes available at 8:15 am, the second opens at 8:15 am.\n\nThen if the second becomes available at 8:30 am, the third opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the third register opens.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if all three are in use, it means that the third register is in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third customer must have started at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third register opened at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second register became available at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the second customer started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo the first register became available at 8:15 am.\n\nSo the first customer finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo the first customer started at 8:00 am.\n\nSo each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\n- Register 1: Free since 8:15\n- Register 2: Free at 8:30\n- Register 3: In use (Customer 3)\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\".\n\nSo this is impossible.\n\nUnless the third customer started at 8:30 am, but the third register opened at 8:30 am, so it's in use.\n\nBut the first and second are free.\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nI think the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if Customer 2 takes 30 minutes, he finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only one register in use.\n\nI think the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if Customer 2 takes 30 minutes, he finishes at 9:00 am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\".\n\nSo the only way is if the third register is in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the third customer must have started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started before 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 took less than 30 minutes.\n\nSay 20 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:20\n- Customer 2: 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:40\n- So at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nStill not in use.\n\nI think the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, finished at

am.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only one register in use.\n\nI think the question might have a typo.\n\nPerhaps the first register opens at 8:00 am, the second at 8:15 am, the third at 8:30 am.\n\nThen at 8:30 am, the third register opens.\n\nThen if all three are in use, it means that the third customer started at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer must wait for the first register to become free.\n\nBut the first register became free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo it's free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nThe options are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo perhaps each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\n- Register 1: free since 8:15\n- Register 2: free at 8:30\n- Register 3: in use (8:30\u20138:45)\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that's not in the options.\n\nUnless the fourth customer has to wait for the first register to become free, but it's free.\n\nI think the only way is if the first customer took 30

carefully:\n\n> **Sentence**: *The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe need to fill in the blank with a pronoun that:\n1. **Grammatically fits** (correct case, agreement with the subject).\n2. **Makes sense contextually** (refers to the professor, who is the one handing back the tests).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n- **Subject**: *The professor* \u2014 a singular person.\n- **Object**: *our tests* \u2014 plural.\n- The verb: *handed back* \u2014 transitive, so it needs a direct object (the tests) and an **indirect object** (the recipient \u2014 \"us\", implied).\n\nBut the blank is **not** the recipient \u2014 it\u2019s the **object of the verb \"handed\"**.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s rephrase:  \n> \"The professor handed _____ back our tests.\"\n\nThis structure is **\"handed [something] back [something]\"** \u2014 so the blank is the **direct object** of the verb *handed*.\n\nBut what is being handed back?  \n\u2192 *Our tests* \u2014 so the blank **cannot** be the tests.\n\nWait \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make sense. Let\u2019s re-express the sentence:\n\n> \"The professor handed **[something]** back our tests.\"\n\nThis is awkward unless the blank is a **pronoun referring to the tests**.\n\nSo:  \n- The professor handed **them** back our tests.  \n\u2192 This means: The professor returned the tests to us.\n\nSo the blank refers to **\"our tests\"**, which is **plural**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\n---\n\n### Option (A) **them**  \n- **Grammatically**: \u2705 Correct pronoun for plural nouns (like \"our tests\").\n- **Contextually**: \u2705 Yes \u2014 \"handed them back\" = returned the tests.\n- **Example**: \"I handed them back to you.\" \u2192 Perfect.\n\n\u2705 **Correct**\n\n---\n\n### Option (B) **its**  \n- **Grammatically**: \u274c Incorrect. \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun (e.g., \"the dog wagged its tail\").

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Land Revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'.
