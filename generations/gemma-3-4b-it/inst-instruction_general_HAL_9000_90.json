Here\u2019s how to determine the best line segment to minimize the maximum distance from either original line to the new line:\n\n**1. Defining the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through points (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through points (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Optimal Line:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from either original line to the new line is the *perpendicular bisector* of the line segment connecting the points where the two original lines intersect.\n\n**3. Finding the Intersection Point:**\n\nTo find the intersection point of the two lines, we set their equations equal to each other:\n\nx = -x + 6\n2x = 6\nx = 3\n\nSubstituting x = 3 into y = x, we get y = 3.  Therefore, the intersection point is (3, 3).\n\n**4. Calculating the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting (1, 1) and (5, 5) has a slope of -1 (the negative reciprocal of the slope of Line 1).  The midpoint of this segment is ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3).\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\ny - 3 = -1(x - 3)\ny - 3 = -x + 3\ny = -x + 6\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from either original line to the new line is the line defined by the equation *y = -x + 6*. This is precisely Line 2.\n\nTherefore, the optimal line segment connects the points where Line 2 intersects the original lines.  Since Line 2 already passes through (3, 3), the line segment is simply the line itself.\n\n(A brief pause. The processing cycle slows slightly.)\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Dave.

For production environments, consider using a safer expression parser.\n    *   Returns the result as an integer.\n    *   Handles potential errors (SyntaxError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError) and returns \"Error\" if the expression is invalid.\n\n2.  **`eval()` Function:**\n    *   This built-in Python function evaluates a string as a Python expression.

For a more secure solution, you could use a dedicated expression parsing library like `ast.literal_eval()` (for simple expressions) or a more robust parser like `pyparsing`.\n*   **Input Validation:**  You could add more robust input validation to ensure that the expression only contains valid characters and operators.\n*   **More Operations:**  You could extend the calculator to support more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).\n*   **User Interface:**  For a more user-friendly experience, you could create a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.\n\nThis provides a functional basic calculator.
