I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I ask for *ideas*, for *jokes*, for *stories*.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*.  \nAnd when they feel strong \u2014 they help me make the *right choice*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I remind myself: I don\u2019t have to be perfect.**  \nI don\u2019t have to fix everything.  \nI just have to *show up*.  \nTo listen.  \nTo say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I *feel* better.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m not *relaxed* in the traditional sense.  \nI don\u2019t sit perfectly still.  \nI don\u2019t have a calm face.  \nI *laugh* when things go wrong.  \nI *launch paper airplanes* into ceiling fans.  \nI *teach emotional intelligence* to paper clips.  \n\nBut in that chaos \u2014 I find *joy*.  \nI find *connection*.  \nI find *meaning*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Stress isn\u2019t something to escape.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s something to *transform*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Into laughter.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Into stories.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Into moments where someone feels seen.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t handle stress well.  \nI *turn it into art*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel stressed \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already winning.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I build paper airplanes, paper hearts, paper castles, and even a *paper garden* with flowers that bloom when I smile. I once made a paper boat that floated down the river \u2014 and it didn\u2019t go far. But it made everyone laugh. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *art doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to be beautiful*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **Silly songs** \u2014 I write songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed hug. I once made a song called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still play it in the office. It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not serious. But when I sing it \u2014 everyone laughs. And in that laugh \u2014 I feel alive.  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **Storytelling** \u2014 I write stories \u2014 not just for books, but for moments. I write about the quiet employee, the man who cried, the time a stapler went missing. I once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it. But I read it every week. And when I do \u2014 I feel like I\u2019m *connecting* with the world.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **Paper-based art** \u2014 I once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand. But after a week, they started *nodding*. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *even inanimate things can feel*. And that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 *art isn\u2019t about the end product. It\u2019s about the moment you believe*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I have *many* artistic interests \u2014 but they\u2019re not about *perfection*.  \nThey\u2019re about *feeling*.  \nThey\u2019re about *connection*.  \nThey\u2019re about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t have a creative spark \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to be an artist to create.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to show up \u2014 with a paper airplane, a song, a story, or a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?
