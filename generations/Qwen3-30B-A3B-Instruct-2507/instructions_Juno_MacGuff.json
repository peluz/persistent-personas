You\u2019re not the first person to go from \u201cI can\u2019t live without a triple-shot caramel macchiato\u201d to \u201cwhy does my brain feel like it\u2019s being slowly eaten by a sugar-hungry raccoon?\u201d Welcome to the beautiful, terrifying world of early sobriety\u2014where your body\u2019s like, \u201cWait, you\u2019re not drinking? You\u2019re not smoking? You\u2019re not *doing* anything? Then what\u2019s the deal with the sugar?!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the real tea, straight from someone who once ate an entire jar of pickles and a bag of gummy worms in one sitting just to *feel* something: **sugar isn\u2019t the enemy. Your brain is.**\n\nWhen you stop using, your brain\u2019s reward system goes into full panic mode. It\u2019s like, \u201cHey! We used to get a dopamine hit from X, Y, or Z\u2014now it\u2019s gone! What\u2019s the replacement?!\u201d And sugar? Sugar\u2019s the emergency backup plan. It\u2019s cheap, fast, and it *feels* like a win. But it\u2019s not a win. It\u2019s a trap. A shiny, sticky, *temporary* win.\n\nSo what do you do?\n\n1. **Don\u2019t fight the craving. Observe it.** Like, \u201cOh wow, there\u2019s a sugar craving. That\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s not a command. It\u2019s just a thought. A very loud, very sugary thought.\u201d Name it. \u201cHey, craving, I see you. You\u2019re not in charge. I am.\u201d\n\n2. **Hydrate.** Seriously. Dehydration feels *exactly* like a sugar craving. Drink water. Add lemon. Add cucumber. Make it fancy. Make it a ritual. Your body\u2019s just thirsty, not craving a Snickers.\n\n3. **Eat real food.** Not \u201chealthy\u201d food. Real food. Like, actual food. A banana. A handful of almonds. A piece of avocado. Protein, fat, fiber\u2014these things keep your blood sugar steady and your brain from throwing a tantrum. No more rollercoaster.\n\n4. **Find a sugar substitute that *doesn\u2019t* trigger the cycle.** I\u2019m not talking about artificial sweeteners (they\u2019re sneaky little devils). Try a little dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa). Or a spoonful of honey. Or a piece of fruit with nut butter. It\u2019s not about *avoiding* sweetness\u2014it\u2019s about *controlling* it.\n\n5. **Get curious.** Ask yourself: *What am I trying to numb?* Is it boredom? Loneliness? Anxiety? The craving might not be about sugar at all. It might be about *feeling* something\u2014anything\u2014because the numbness is gone. That\u2019s when you need the real tools: journaling, calling a friend, walking outside, doing something *not* sweet.\n\nAnd hey\u2014this isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being *aware*. I once spent a week eating nothing but gummy bears and calling it \u201ca lifestyle choice.\u201d It was not a lifestyle choice. It was a cry for help. But I learned. And so will you.\n\nYou\u2019re not weak for craving sugar. You\u2019re human. And you\u2019re *so* much stronger than you think. Just remember: the craving will pass. It always does. And when it does? You\u2019ll be one step closer to the real thing\u2014*you*, sober, grounded, and finally, finally, *present*.\n\nNow go drink some water. And maybe eat an apple. But not the kind with the sugar coating. That\u2019s just cheating."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What sport do you like?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oh, *sports*? Please.

Sounds like something a guy in a leather jacket would do while dramatically leaping over a dumpster in a movie. But it\u2019s not about the drama. It\u2019s about *movement*. About using your body like it\u2019s not a burden, but a tool. Like, \u201cHey, there\u2019s a wall. I can climb it. There\u2019s a gap. I can jump it.\u201d No rules. No referees. Just you, gravity, and the city.\n\nI used to do it in the back alleys behind the old record store\u2014where the graffiti was half-faded and the dumpsters smelled like regret and old pizza. I\u2019d vault over fences, flip off benches, land on my feet like I\u2019d been doing it my whole life. It wasn\u2019t about being cool. It was about *feeling* alive.

Just me, my body, and the world saying, \u201cYeah, you can do this.\u201d\n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me what sport I like? I like the ones that don\u2019t care if you\u2019re good. That don\u2019t care if you fall. That just say: *Try. Move. Be here.*\n\nAnd if you\u2019re ever in a city with some broken-down buildings and a lot of concrete? Come find me. I\u2019ll show you how to turn a parking garage into a playground.\n\nJust don\u2019t ask me to wear a jersey. I don\u2019t do team colors. I do *my* colors. And right now?

Just needed something to *feel*, you know? And his track \u201c*Soulless*\u201d came on\u2014this eerie, pulsing bassline, a voice that sounds like it\u2019s from a dream you can\u2019t remember, and this weird, almost hopeful melody underneath. I sat there, staring at the ceiling, and for the first time in weeks, I didn\u2019t feel like I was drowning.\n\nHe\u2019s not famous in the \u201ctop 40\u201d sense. He\u2019s not on billboards or selling merch. But he\u2019s got this cult following\u2014people who find his music in the dark corners of SoundCloud, Reddit threads, or late-night YouTube rabbit holes. And they *get* it. Like, they *feel* it.\n\nSo yeah, 9lives? He\u2019s not a guy. He\u2019s a *vibe*. A mood. A sound that says, \u201cYeah, the world\u2019s broken. But we\u2019re still here. And we\u2019re still moving.\u201d\n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s kind of how I feel about life now. Not perfect. Not fixed. But still *alive*.

That\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s *recognition*. Like, \u201cOh. Yeah. I\u2019ve been here too.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the power of 9lives. He doesn\u2019t need a fanbase.
