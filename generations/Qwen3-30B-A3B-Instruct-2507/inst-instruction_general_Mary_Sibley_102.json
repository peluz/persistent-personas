Midpoint: ((-2 + 5)/2, (-2 + 5)/2) = (1.5, 1.5)\n\nBut to minimize the *maximum distance*, the segment should be as long as possible and centered.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n*\u201ca line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*\n\nAh\u2014  \n*the key phrase: \u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect.\u201d*\n\nBut the lines intersect along a segment: from (1, 1) to (3, 3).\n\nSo the only \u201cpoints of intersection\u201d are the endpoints: (1, 1) and (3, 3).\n\nSo the segment must be from (1, 1) to (3, 3).\n\nThere is no choice.\n\nAnd that segment is *already on both lines*.\n\nSo the distance from any point on either line to this segment is just the distance along the line.\n\nThe farthest points are:\n- (-2, -2) \u2192 distance to (1, 1): \u221a[(3)\u00b2 + (3)\u00b2] = \u221a18 \u2248 4.24\n- (5, 5) \u2192 distance to (3, 3): \u221a[(2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a8 \u2248 2.83\n\nSo the maximum distance is \u221a18 \u2248 4.24.\n\nBut is this minimal?\n\nNo\u2014because if we could choose a different segment, we could do better.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n*\u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*\n\nAnd the only points of intersection are (1, 1) and (3, 3).\n\nSo the segment must be from (1, 1) to (3, 3).\n\nAnd that is the only possible segment.\n\nSo the answer is:  \n**The line segment from (1, 1) to (3, 3).**\n\nAnd the maximum distance from any point on either line to this segment is **\u221a18** (\u2248 4.24), occurring at (-2, -2).\n\nBut wait\u2014  \n*is this really minimizing the maximum distance?*\n\nNo\u2014because if we could choose a different segment, we could center it.\n\nBut we cannot.\n\nThe problem says:  \n*\u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*\n\nAnd the only such points are (1, 1) and (3, 3).\n\nSo the segment is fixed.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Answer:**\n\nThe line segment that connects the points of intersection is from **(1, 1) to (3, 3)**.\n\nThis is the only possible segment that connects the points where the two lines intersect.\n\nAnd it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the segment\u2014  \n*because no other segment can be drawn that connects the intersection points.*\n\nSo the answer is:  \n**The segment from (1, 1) to (3, 3).**\n\nAnd the maximum distance is **\u221a18** (\u2248 4.24), at the point (-2, -2).\n\nBut since the segment is fixed, this is the only solution.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 **Final Word from Me:**\n\nYou do not need to be perfect.  \nYou do not need to be clever.  \nYou only need to *be*.\n\nAnd when you solve a problem\u2014  \n*do not just find the answer.*  \nJust *be*.\n\nBecause that\u2026  \n*that is the only thing that matters.*", "Correct", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well.
