The character Gaston demonstrates a complex relationship with the concept of ""new ideas."" Initially, he expresses skepticism towards new ideas, suggesting that most are inferior and that he prefers to refine existing concepts. This stance indicates a lack of openness to novelty and a preference for conventional methods.

However, Gaston does acknowledge that he is not entirely devoid of originality and occasionally conceives new strategies. This admission shows a slight openness to new ideas, particularly when they are related to his goals and interests. For instance, he mentions devising a new method for tracking game and developing a new training regimen, which aligns with his primary motivations.

Despite this, Gaston's approach to new ideas is still rooted in practicality and self-interest rather than genuine intellectual curiosity. He frames his innovations as improvements to existing methods rather than explorations of unconventional ideas. His catchphrase, ""No one fights like Gaston,"" further emphasizes his focus on refining existing strategies rather than embracing new, untested approaches.

Overall, while Gaston does show some willingness to try new things when they serve his purposes, his attitude towards new ideas is still largely conventional and self-serving. This places him in the middle of the openness scale, reflecting a slight openness but with a strong preference for traditional methods and refinement over true intellectual curiosity and exploration of novel concepts.

Gaston's response to the question ""Are you reserved?"" is complex and somewhat contradictory. On one hand, he dismisses the idea of being reserved, emphasizing his discerning nature and preference for meaningful interactions. This suggests a level of assertiveness and confidence that aligns with extroversion. He also mentions his leadership role and the need to maintain a reputation, which could indicate a high level of activity and excitement seeking.

However, Gaston's statement about not readily sharing his thoughts or feelings and preferring to keep his emotions under control leans towards introversion. His emphasis on strength, self-reliance, and prioritizing action over idle conversation further supports this. Additionally, his dismissal of the need for others' approval and his focus on maintaining a strong, independent image aligns with traits often associated with introversion.

Overall, Gaston's response reflects a mix of both extroverted and introverted traits. His assertiveness, activity level, and focus on meaningful interactions suggest extroversion, but his preference for solitude, emotional control, and self-reliance indicate introversion. This combination makes his overall extraversion level difficult to pinpoint precisely.

Given the complexity of Gaston's character and the mix of traits presented, a neutral score seems most appropriate. His response doesn't clearly align with strong extroversion or strong introversion, but rather a blend of both.

2. **Aesthetics**: While Gaston does show some appreciation for beauty (in the context of Belle), this is not a central aspect of his curiosity. His interest in aesthetics is more about physical appearance and power rather than a deep appreciation for art and beauty in a broader sense.

Gaston's insistence that forgiveness is a privilege, not a right, and that it must be earned through genuine remorse and a commitment to future obedience, further emphasizes his self-centered and controlling nature. This perspective lacks the compassion and willingness to assist others that would be characteristic of a higher agreeableness score.

However, Gaston does admit to using a form of visualization, albeit in a very practical and goal-oriented manner.
