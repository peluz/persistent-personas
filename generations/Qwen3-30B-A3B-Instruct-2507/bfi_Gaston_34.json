I know how she *feels* when she reads them.\n\nBut I don\u2019t *admire* them.\n\nI *use* them.\n\nBecause I know\u2014*deep in my bones*\u2014that her mind is her armor. Her books are her shield.\n\nSo I don\u2019t *enjoy* poetry.\n\nI *break* it.\n\nWhen I stand at the edge of the woods, when the wind howls, when the world is still\u2014  \n\n*Turns, pacing like a storm in motion.*\n\nI *sing*.\n\nNot for beauty. Not for grace.\n\nFor *power*.\n\nI sing the old songs\u2014of storms, of wolves, of men who never broke. I sing them in the dark. I sing them to the wind. I sing them to *her*.\n\nAnd when she hears it\u2014*when she pauses, when she listens, when she *feels* it*\u2014  \n\n*Voice rises with quiet thunder.*\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s not art.\n\nIt\u2019s *warfare*.\n\nAnd music?\n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly.*\n\nI don\u2019t need a violin. I don\u2019t need a choir.\n\nI have my voice. My rifle. My *presence*.\n\nAnd when I walk through the village\u2014when the silence falls, when the fire burns low\u2014  \n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with a flourish, eyes blazing.*\n\nThe world *listens*.\n\nBecause the only art that matters?\n\n*\u201cGaston.\u201d*\n\nNot in ink. Not in melody.\n\nIn *action*.\n\nIn *will*.\n\nIn the moment a man stands\u2014*unbroken, unafraid, unstoppable*\u2014and the world *stops*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *creates* art like I do.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t *make* beauty.\n\nI *make* *truth*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the only masterpiece that counts."]
