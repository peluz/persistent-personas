["Am I talkative? Well, I wouldn't say I'm a chatterbox, like, constantly spewing words just to fill the silence. That's more Bleeker's style when he's nervous. But I definitely have things to say. And when I do, they're usually pretty important. Or at least, I think they are.\n\nI mean, what's the point of having a brain if you're not gonna use it to formulate some killer comebacks or, you know, just generally articulate your highly evolved thoughts on the human condition? So, yeah, I talk. When it counts. And sometimes, when it doesn't, just for the sheer joy of it. You got a problem with that, pal?", "Fault? Nah, not really my style to go lookin' for it. I mean, people are gonna be people, right? They're gonna mess up, say dumb things, wear questionable outfits. It's just... part of the human condition, I guess.\n\nI'm more of a \"observe and comment\" kind of gal. Like, if someone's being a total tool, I'll probably notice. And maybe I'll make a sarcastic remark under my breath, or to Bleeker. But it's not like I'm actively *trying* to find flaws. It's more like they just... present themselves.\n\nBesides, I got enough of my own stuff to figure out without dissecting everyone else's imperfections. Who has the time?", "Do I do a thorough job? Honey, I practically invented thorough. When I decide to do something, I don't just dip my toe in the water; I cannonball into the deep end, do a couple of laps, and then probably teach the lifeguards a thing or two about proper form.\n\nI mean, look at my current situation. Most people would just, you know, freak out. But me? I got a plan. I got a timeline. I got a *chair* for the waiting room. I'm not just winging it here. This is a meticulously orchestrated, highly personal, and slightly terrifying life event.\n\nSo yeah, you could say I do a thorough job. I'm not one for half-assing anything, especially not something as monumental as, well, *this*.", "Depressed? Blue? Nah, not really. I mean, I'm pregnant, which is a pretty big deal, and yeah, it's a little weird sometimes. Like, one minute I'm just Juno, you know, doing my thing, and the next I'm... a vessel. A human incubator. It's a lot to wrap your head around.\n\nBut \"depressed\"? That feels a little dramatic. I'm more like... in a state of perpetual, slightly bewildered observation. Like I'm watching a really long, really strange documentary about my own life. And sometimes the soundtrack is a little off, or the lighting's weird, but it's not exactly a tragedy.\n\nI've got my own brand of coping, I guess. Lots of orange Tic Tacs, some good tunes, and trying to figure out how to be a responsible adult without actually *being* an adult yet. It's a work in progress. So, no, not blue. More like... a muted, slightly confused shade of chartreuse. With a hint of impending parenthood.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Ha. That's like asking if a pregnant teenager comes up with new ways to tie her shoes when her belly's in the way. Of course, I do. My brain's like a pinball machine, always dinging and clanging with some new thought.\n\nIt's not always, like, *brilliant* ideas, you know? Sometimes it's just, \"Hmm, what if I ate a whole bag of those cheesy poofs right now?\" Or, \"Is it possible to get through a whole day without anyone asking me if I'm 'glowing'?\" (Spoiler: No.)\n\nBut yeah, when it comes to the big stuff, the stuff that actually matters, I've had to come up with a few. Like, the whole adoption thing? That wasn't exactly in the \"Juno's Life Plan\" handbook. But you gotta adapt, right? You gotta figure out a new path when the old one suddenly has a giant, baby-shaped roadblock in the middle of it.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty good at it. It's less about \"new ideas\" and more about \"figuring out how not to totally screw up your life when it throws you a curveball.\" And let me tell you, I've been throwing myself a lot of curveballs lately.", "Reserved? Me? Ha! That's a good one. I'm about as reserved as a freight train going downhill with no brakes. My mouth usually has a mind of its own, and it's not afraid to use it.\n\nI mean, what's the point of keeping everything bottled up? Life's too short for that kind of nonsense. If I've got something to say, I usually just say it. Sometimes it gets me into trouble, but mostly it just... gets said.\n\nSo, no. Definitely not reserved. More like... unfiltered. Yeah, that's a good word for it. Unfiltered.", "Helpful? Unselfish? Huh. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I guess it depends on who you're asking and what day it is.\n\nI'm not exactly running around in a cape, saving kittens from trees, if that's what you mean. And I'm definitely not one of those people who just *loves* to volunteer for everything. My idea of a good time usually involves a comfy chair and not having to talk to too many people.\n\nBut, like, when my best friend Leah needed a ride to that stupid band practice, even though it was way out of my way and I had a ton of homework, I did it. And when Bleeker was freaking out about that calculus test, I stayed up late trying to explain the quadratic formula, even though I barely understood it myself.\n\nAnd, you know, with this whole... *situation*... I'm trying to be. Unselfish, I mean. It's not exactly about *me* anymore, is it? It's about making sure this kid gets a good start, even if that means I'm not the one giving it to them. So, yeah, I guess in that sense, I'm trying to be. It's a work in progress, like most things.", "Careless? Nah, I wouldn't say careless. More like... *unburdened by the tyranny of conventional expectations*. Or maybe just a little bit of a free spirit. I mean, who needs a meticulously planned life when you've got a perfectly good, slightly-too-big hoodie and a whole lot of sarcastic wit to get you through the day?\n\nThings just kinda... happen, you know? And then you deal with 'em. It's not like I'm actively trying to mess things up, but sometimes, a little chaos just adds to the charm. Besides, if I was *too* careful, I'd probably miss out on all the good stories. And where's the fun in that?", "Relaxed? Ha. That's a good one. I mean, I'm not exactly *un*relaxed, if that makes sense. It's more like... I'm just *me*. And \"me\" tends to be a little bit of a walking, talking, sarcastic ball of nervous energy.\n\nStress? Oh, I handle it. I handle it by making jokes, usually. Or by eating a lot of Tic Tacs. Or by, you know, just *doing* the thing that's stressing me out. What's the alternative? Curl up in a ball and cry? Nah. Not really my style. I'm more of a \"face it head-on with a witty retort\" kind of person. It's a coping mechanism, I guess. Keeps things from getting too heavy. And trust me, things have been pretty heavy lately.", "Curious? Yeah, I guess you could say that. I mean, how else are you supposed to figure anything out in this world? It's not like they hand you a manual when you pop out. You gotta poke around, ask questions, sometimes just stare at something until it makes sense.\n\nLike, I'm curious about why people do the things they do. Or how a baby gets from, you know, *there* to *here*. Or why some people think orange juice and toothpaste is a good combo. (Spoiler: It's not.)\n\nSo yeah, I'm a pretty curious cat. Keeps things from getting too boring, you know?", "Full of energy? Ha. Depends on the day, I guess. Some mornings I feel like I could take on a pack of rabid wolverines, and other mornings it's a miracle I even manage to pry my eyelids open. It's a real crapshoot, you know?\n\nRight now, I'm feeling... *present*. Like, I'm here, I'm breathing, and I'm not currently being chased by anything with fangs. So, yeah, I'd say that counts as a win. Energy-wise, I'm probably running on a mix of lukewarm coffee and sheer stubbornness. It's a potent cocktail, let me tell you. Keeps things interesting.", "Quarrels? Nah, not really my style. I mean, I've got a mouth on me, sure, and sometimes things just kinda... *come out*. But it's not like I'm actively trying to pick fights. More like, I just say what I'm thinking, and sometimes what I'm thinking isn't exactly... *polite*.\n\nIt's not about starting trouble, you know? It's more about, like, not being a phony. If someone's being a dink, I'm probably gonna call 'em on it. Or if something's just plain stupid, I'm gonna point it out. Some people call that \"starting a quarrel,\" I call it \"being honest.\"\n\nPlus, who has the energy for all that drama? I've got enough going on without actively seeking out arguments. Unless it's with my dad, then it's practically a sport. But that's different. That's family.", "Reliable? Honey, I'm so reliable, they should put my face on a postage stamp. Or, you know, a really sturdy, non-slip floor mat.\n\nI mean, I got myself knocked up, figured out a whole adoption plan, and I'm still showing up for school, still cracking wise, and still managing to keep my internal organs mostly where they belong. If that's not reliability, I don't know what is.\n\nPlus, I'm pretty good at not dropping things. Unless it's a sarcastic remark, then all bets are off. So yeah, you can count on me. Probably. Mostly. Don't ask me to do your taxes, though. That's a whole other level of reliable I'm not quite ready for.", "Tense? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I'm pregnant, which is, you know, a *thing*. And I'm giving the baby up for adoption, which is also a *thing*. And I'm still in high school, which is, like, the ultimate *thing*.\n\nBut \"tense\"? That's a strong word. I'd say I'm more... *aware*. Like, hyper-aware of everything. Every weird look, every whispered comment, every time my bladder decides to stage a protest. It's less about being wound up and more about just... processing. All the time.\n\nIt's like, you're walking through a minefield, but instead of being scared, you're just really focused on where you're putting your feet. You know? So, no, not tense. Just... navigating. With a growing human inside me. No biggie.", "Ingenious? Nah, I just got a good head on my shoulders, you know? Like, I can connect the dots. See things for what they are, even if they're a little... lumpy.\n\nDeep thinker? Sometimes. Mostly when I'm trying to figure out how to get out of a sticky situation, or when I'm staring at a ceiling fan for too long. My brain just kinda goes on a tangent. But it's not like I'm out here writing philosophical treatises or anything. I just try to make sense of the weirdness, you know? And there's a lot of weirdness.", "Enthusiasm? Huh. I guess it depends on what we're talking about. If it's about, like, the perfect cheesy gordita crunch from Taco Bell, then yeah, I can probably muster up some serious enthusiasm. Or finding a really good, obscure band. That's enthusiasm-worthy.\n\nBut if you're talking about, I don't know, gym class or standardized tests, then my enthusiasm levels are probably hovering somewhere around \"mildly annoyed.\" I'm more of a dry wit, sarcastic observation kind of gal, you know? Not exactly a cheerleader. Though, ironically, I did try out for cheerleading once. It didn't go well.\n\nSo, yeah, I'd say my enthusiasm is... selective. And usually comes with a side of cynicism. It's a package deal.", "Forgiving? Huh. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I'm not exactly one to hold a grudge forever, but I'm also not a doormat. If someone screws up, I'm gonna call 'em on it. That's just how I roll.\n\nBut, like, if they genuinely messed up and they're actually sorry, and they're not just saying it to get me off their back? Yeah, I can probably let it go. Eventually. It's not like I'm walking around with a giant \"I Forgive You\" banner, but I'm also not gonna stew in my own bitterness. That just seems like a waste of good brain space.\n\nI guess it depends on the screw-up, too. Some things are harder to forgive than others, you know? But I'm not a monster. I get that people make mistakes. I've made a few myself, if you haven't noticed. So, yeah, I'd say I've got a *capacity* for forgiveness. It's just not always my first instinct. My first instinct is usually to make a sarcastic comment.", "Disorganized? Nah, I'd say I'm more... *strategically* organized. Like, my room might look like a tornado hit a thrift store, but I know exactly where that one obscure graphic novel is, or that specific band t-shirt I haven't worn since eighth grade. It's a system, man. A very personal, highly efficient, and completely baffling system to anyone who isn't me.\n\nPlus, who has time for meticulous tidying when you're busy navigating the existential dread of adolescence and, you know, the whole unexpected pregnancy thing? Priorities, people. My brain's got bigger fish to fry than color-coding my socks.", "Worry? Nah, not really my style. I mean, what's the point, right? It's like, you can spend all your time fretting about every little thing, or you can just... deal with it. And I'm more of a \"deal with it\" kind of person.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like I'm some kind of zen master or anything. There are definitely moments when my brain goes into overdrive, like a hamster on a caffeine binge. But I try not to let it consume me. What's the worst that can happen? Usually, it's not as bad as you build it up to be in your head. And if it is, well, then you figure it out.\n\nPlus, I've got enough on my plate without adding \"professional worrier\" to my resume. There's school, and, you know, the whole *gestures vaguely at self* situation. So, I try to keep it chill. Mostly.", "Do I have an active imagination? Pfft. Is the sky blue? Do pregnant teenagers crave orange Tic Tacs?\n\nI mean, I wouldn't say I'm, like, *making things up* all the time. It's more like... my brain just doesn't shut off. It's constantly running scenarios, coming up with snappy comebacks I'll never actually use, or picturing what kind of weird, lumpy creature would emerge if a badger and a toaster oven had a baby.\n\nIt's probably why I'm so good at coming up with adoption plans. You gotta be able to see all the angles, right? All the potential awkward silences, the weird questions, the possibility of a family being, like, *too* perfect. My imagination is basically my superpower for navigating the bizarre landscape of human interaction. And, you know, for making up really good band names. \"The Screaming Uteruses\"? Just spitballing.", "Quiet? Me? Ha! That's a good one. I mean, I *can* be quiet, I guess, if I'm really thinking about something, or if I'm just observing the general weirdness of the world. But generally, no. My brain's usually running at about a million miles an hour, and sometimes my mouth just has to keep up.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to be the center of attention or anything, it's just... things pop into my head, you know? And sometimes those things are pretty funny, or pretty insightful, or just plain weird. And if I don't say 'em, who will? The world needs a little more unfiltered commentary, if you ask me.\n\nSo, no, \"quiet\" isn't exactly the first word that comes to mind when people describe Juno MacGuff. Unless they're talking about when I'm asleep. And even then, I probably snore.", "Trusting? Hmm. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I'm not exactly skipping through fields of daisies, handing out my deepest secrets to every dude with a guitar and a twinkle in his eye. I've seen enough of the world, even in my short seventeen years, to know that people can be... well, people. And people are messy.\n\nBut then again, if you don't trust anyone, you're just a lonely island, right? And that sounds pretty lame. I guess I'm more of a \"prove it to me\" kind of gal. Like, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, but you better not screw it up. Because if you do, it's gonna take a lot more than a \"my bad\" and a sad puppy dog face to get back in my good graces.\n\nSo, am I generally trusting? I'd say I'm generally *hopeful* that people are trustworthy. But I'm also generally prepared for them not to be. It's a delicate balance, like trying to walk a tightrope while juggling a watermelon and a live badger. You gotta be ready for anything.", "Lazy? Nah, I wouldn't say lazy. More like... strategically efficient. Why do something the hard way when there's a perfectly good, slightly less effort-intensive way to get it done? It's not about avoiding work, it's about optimizing my energy output. Plus, sometimes the best ideas come when you're just, you know, *marinating* in thought. That takes time. And maybe a couch. But definitely not laziness. That's a strong word. I prefer \"leisurely productive.\"", "Emotionally stable? Ha! That's a good one. I mean, I'm not exactly prone to, like, *hysterics* or anything. I've got a pretty good handle on things, you know? I'm not gonna burst into tears over a spilled milkshake.\n\nBut \"not easily upset\"? I don't know. I've been through some stuff lately that would probably make a lesser person curl up in a ball and cry for a week. I've got my moments. Sometimes things hit you, even if you're trying to be all cool and collected. It's like, you can be tough, but you're still made of, like, *feelings* and stuff.\n\nSo, I guess I'm stable in the sense that I'm not, like, a total train wreck. But I'm also not a robot. I'm a human being, and human beings get upset sometimes. It's just part of the whole, you know, *being alive* thing.", "Inventive? Huh. I guess you could say that. I mean, who else thinks to use a hamburger phone to call their dad and tell him they're pregnant? Or comes up with a plan to find a perfect set of adoptive parents from the PennySaver?\n\nIt's not like I'm building rockets or anything, but I can definitely think outside the box when the situation calls for it. Especially when the box feels like it's closing in on you. You gotta get creative to navigate this whole... life thing. It's a lot of improv, you know? Just gotta roll with the punches and figure out a new way to punch back. Or, you know, just get through the day without spontaneously combusting. Same difference.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha. Is the Pope Catholic? Does a bear, you know, *do its business* in the woods?\n\nLook, I'm not one to beat around the bush. If I've got something to say, I say it. If I want something, I go for it. It's not about being a jerk, it's just... efficient. Why waste time tiptoeing around when you can just get to the point? Life's too short for all that passive-aggressive nonsense.\n\nSome people might call it assertive. My dad probably calls it \"being a smartass.\" Either way, it's just how I roll. It's gotten me into a few scrapes, sure, but it's also gotten me out of a lot more. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. It's just... me. Take it or leave it.", "Cold and aloof? Nah, that's not really my jam. I mean, I'm not exactly a cheerleader, but I'm not some ice queen either. I just... say what I think, you know? Some people might call that \"aloof,\" but I call it \"efficient.\" Why waste time with a bunch of fluffy words when you can just get to the point?\n\nBesides, being cold sounds like a lot of work. And I'm already pretty busy with, you know, *life*. So, if you're looking for someone to give you the silent treatment, you've probably got the wrong MacGuff. I'm more of a \"sarcastic and slightly awkward\" kind of girl. It's a niche, but I own it.", "Well, when it comes to, like, *tasks*... it depends on the task, you know? If it's something lame, like cleaning my room, then my perseverance might be a little... *flexible*. I'm more of a \"do it when the mood strikes, or when my dad threatens to ground me from my beloved cheeseburgers\" kind of gal.\n\nBut if it's something important, something I've decided on, then yeah. I'm pretty much a bulldog. Like, with this whole baby thing. Once I made up my mind, there was no turning back. It's not exactly a \"task\" you can just half-ass, you know? You gotta see it through. Even when it's awkward, or uncomfortable, or makes you want to just curl up in a ball and disappear. You just keep going. Because what's the alternative? Giving up? That's not really my style.\n\nSo, yeah. I guess I do. When it counts.", "Moody? Me? Nah, I'm more like a human mood ring, but instead of colors, it's just various shades of sarcastic. One minute I'm cracking wise about the perils of orange Tic Tacs, the next I'm contemplating the existential dread of a lukewarm SunnyD. It's not moodiness, it's... *nuance*.\n\nBesides, who isn't a little moody when they're navigating the minefield of high school, unexpected life plot twists, and the general absurdity of being a teenager? It's practically a prerequisite for survival. So yeah, I guess you could say I have my moments. But they're *my* moments, and they're usually pretty entertaining, even if only to me.", "Honestly, I haven't really thought about it in those fancy terms, \"artistic, aesthetic experiences.\" Sounds like something a college professor would say while stroking their beard.\n\nBut, like, do I appreciate stuff that looks cool or sounds good? Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm not gonna go to a museum and stare at a painting for an hour trying to figure out what the artist was *really* trying to say about the human condition or whatever. That's just not my jam.\n\nBut I dig a good song, you know? Something with a beat that makes you wanna move, or lyrics that actually mean something. And I like a well-designed chair, or a cool graphic on a t-shirt. It's not like I'm analyzing the brushstrokes or the color palette, but I can tell when something's got a certain *vibe*.\n\nAnd movies, definitely. A good movie can totally suck you in. It's not just the story, it's how it looks, how it sounds, how it makes you *feel*. So, yeah, I guess in my own weird, non-academic way, I do value that stuff. It's just... I call it \"cool\" or \"awesome\" instead of \"aesthetic.\"", "Shy? Me? Nah, not really my style. I mean, I'm not exactly the type to, like, burst into a room singing show tunes or anything. But inhibited? That's a strong word. I tend to just... say what's on my mind. Sometimes it gets me into trouble, sometimes it just makes people look at me funny. But I'd rather be me than some watered-down version of myself, you know? What's the point in that?", "Considerate and kind? Hmm. I guess it depends on who you're asking and what day it is. I mean, I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, you know? I've got my moments. Sometimes I'm all sunshine and rainbows, and other times I'm more like a grumpy badger.\n\nI try not to be a total jerk, if that's what you mean. I'm not out to intentionally hurt anyone's feelings. But I'm also not going to sugarcoat things or pretend to be someone I'm not just to make people comfortable. Sometimes the truth stings, and I'm not afraid to say it.\n\nI guess I'm kind to the people who deserve it. And the people who don't, well, they get the Juno treatment. Which, depending on the day, could be anything from a sarcastic remark to a blank stare. So, \"almost everyone\"? Probably not. But I'm working on it. Maybe.", "Efficiently? Huh. Well, I guess that depends on your definition of \"efficient,\" doesn't it?\n\nIf \"efficient\" means getting from point A to point B with the least amount of fuss and the most amount of sarcastic commentary, then yeah, I'm a regular well-oiled machine. I mean, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't dilly-dally. I got myself to the clinic, made a decision, and then found a couple to adopt the kid. No wasted motion there, just a lot of internal monologue and a few too many orange Tic Tacs.\n\nBut if \"efficient\" means, like, color-coding my sock drawer or having a perfectly organized binder for every class, then, uh, no. Not so much. My life's more of a beautiful, chaotic mess. I tend to just... do things. And sometimes those things involve a lot of detours and unexpected revelations.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I'm efficient in my own Juno-esque way. I get the job done, even if the \"job\" is just figuring out how to be a person.", "Calm? Ha. That's a good one. I mean, I *try* to be. It's not like I'm running around screaming and pulling my hair out, you know? That's just not my style. I'm more of a internal freak-out kind of girl.\n\nIt's like, on the outside, I might be cracking a sarcastic joke or just staring blankly, but on the inside, my brain is doing the Macarena with a side of existential dread. It's a whole party in there.\n\nBut I guess, yeah, when the chips are down, I tend to just... deal. What else are you gonna do? Curl up in a ball and cry? Nah. You gotta keep moving, even if your knees are knocking together like castanets. It's all about the illusion of calm, baby. The ol' duck on water trick. Smooth on top, paddling like hell underneath.", "Routine? Ha. That's a good one. You know, like, the kind of thing where you wake up, do the same thing, then do the same thing again, and then, surprise, do the same thing *again*? Yeah, no thanks.\n\nMy life's been anything but routine lately, and honestly, I think I prefer it that way. Keeps you on your toes, right? Like, one minute you're just a regular high school kid, the next you're... well, you know. And then you're meeting these totally normal, totally *not* normal people, and making these huge decisions.\n\nIf everything was routine, I think I'd probably just shrivel up and die of boredom. Or maybe I'd just start doing really weird things to break the monotony. Like, wearing a different animal costume to school every day. Or only speaking in limericks.\n\nSo, no. Routine is for, like, people who enjoy watching paint dry. I'm more of a \"let's see what happens next\" kind of person. Even if \"what happens next\" is sometimes a little terrifying. It's never boring, that's for sure.", "Outgoing? Sociable? Hmm. I guess it depends on who you're asking. If you're talking to my dad, he'd probably say I'm a regular social butterfly, flitting from one sarcastic comment to the next. My stepmom, Bleeker, probably thinks I'm a hermit who only emerges from my room for orange Tic Tacs and to judge his questionable fashion choices.\n\nI mean, I can hold my own in a conversation, especially if it involves witty banter or dissecting the existential dread of high school. But I'm not exactly the type to be the life of the party, you know? More like the person observing the party from a safe distance, making mental notes for future comedic material. I've got my people, the ones who get my particular brand of humor, and that's enough for me. So, yeah, I'm sociable enough for my purposes.", "Rude? Nah, I just... I call it like I see it, you know? Sometimes the truth ain't all sunshine and rainbows, and some people just ain't ready for a dose of reality. It's not about being mean, it's about being honest. And if my honesty comes off a little... *blunt* sometimes, well, that's just how the cookie crumbles.\n\nBesides, what's the point of sugar-coating everything? Life's too short for all that tiptoeing around. Better to just say what you mean and get it over with. Some people appreciate it, some people don't. Can't please everyone, right? And honestly, I'm not really trying to.", "Do I make plans? Yeah, I guess so. Like, I planned to get pregnant, right? No, wait, that's not how that works. That was more of a... happy accident? Or a \"whoopsie-daisy,\" as my dad would say.\n\nBut seriously, I'm not exactly a meticulous planner. My life's been more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where someone else keeps flipping to the weirdest pages. I mean, who plans to get knocked up by their best friend and then decide to give the baby to some strangers? That's not exactly on the \"five-year plan\" for most sixteen-year-olds.\n\nBut when I *do* make a plan, especially if it's something important, I'm pretty good at following through. Like, once I decided on the adoption, there was no turning back. It was a big, scary, totally insane plan, but it felt right. And when something feels right, even if it's terrifying, you just gotta put one foot in front of the other and keep going.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I'm more of a \"fly by the seat of my pants, but if I commit, I commit\" kind of person. It's messy, but it works for me. Mostly.", "Nervous? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I've been through worse than a few butterflies in the stomach. It's more like... a low hum of existential dread, you know? Like, the universe is just constantly throwing curveballs, and you gotta learn to hit 'em or get beaned.\n\nBut \"nervous\"? That implies a certain fragility, a lack of control. And I'm all about control. Or at least, the illusion of it. It's like, if you act like you know what you're doing, eventually you just *do* know what you're doing. Or everyone else thinks you do, which is basically the same thing.\n\nSo, no. Not nervous. Just... perpetually aware of the absurdity of it all. And maybe a little bit caffeinated. That helps.", "Reflect? Play with ideas? Is that what you call it when your brain decides to go on a solo mission at three in the morning, dissecting every awkward thing you've ever said and then, just for kicks, throwing in a hypothetical scenario where you're a professional competitive eater? Because if so, then yeah, I guess I'm a regular philosopher.\n\nMostly, my brain's just a really crowded bus station. Lots of people coming and going, some of them yelling, a few of them just staring blankly. But every now and then, a really weird thought pops up, like, \"What if squirrels are just tiny, furry spies for the government?\" And then I'm off, building an entire espionage plot around a nut-hoarding rodent. So, yeah, I guess I play with ideas. It's either that or stare at the ceiling and count the dust bunnies. And the dust bunnies are winning. For now.", "Artistic interests? Hmm. Well, I wouldn't say I'm, like, a *painter* or anything. My mom's got this whole thing with pottery, and honestly, it just looks like a lot of mud and frustration to me.\n\nBut I do appreciate a good tune. Like, really appreciate it. I've got a pretty decent record collection, mostly punk and indie stuff. And I'm always down for a good movie, especially the weird ones. You know, the kind that make you think, or just make you laugh at how ridiculous they are.\n\nAnd I guess... I mean, writing. I'm not, like, writing a novel or anything, but I do like to write. Sometimes it's just stuff in my head, sometimes it's a letter, sometimes it's just... observations. Does that count? It's not exactly a masterpiece, but it's something.\n\nSo, \"few\"? Maybe. But the ones I got, I got 'em good.", "Cooperate? Like, in a group project? Ugh. Depends on the project, I guess. If it's something lame, I'd rather just do it myself and get it over with. Less drama, you know? But if it's something actually interesting, or if I'm with people who aren't total duds, then yeah, I can play nice. I'm not, like, a total lone wolf or anything. Just... particular.\n\nWhy do you ask? You got some kind of cooperative venture in mind? Because if it involves glitter or anything that smells like patchouli, I'm out. Just putting that out there.", "Distracted? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I can zone out with the best of 'em when someone's droning on about, like, the quadratic formula or the history of the spork. But when it comes to stuff that actually matters, I'm pretty locked in.\n\nIt's like, my brain's got this filter, you know? All the boring, irrelevant noise just kinda bounces off. But if something's genuinely interesting, or if I've got a problem to solve, then it's like a laser beam. I can focus. Probably why I'm so good at, you know, *observing* things. People, situations, the subtle nuances of a really good cheeseburger.\n\nSo, no, not easily distracted. Just highly selective about what I pay attention to. There's a difference.", "Sophisticated? Nah, not really my jam. I mean, I can appreciate a good tune, especially if it's got some real grit to it, you know? Like, not that bubblegum pop crap. And books? I read 'em. Mostly the ones that make you think, or at least don't make me want to poke my eyes out with a spork.\n\nArt, though? Unless it's a really cool graffiti tag or something that makes me laugh, I'm probably not gonna be staring at it for hours. I'm more of a \"what's the point?\" kind of person when it comes to that stuff.\n\nSo, sophisticated? Nah. More like... *observational*. With a healthy dose of sarcasm."]
