A real brute. Everyone said it was foolish, reckless even. They said, \"Gaston, you're a hunter, not a fool! Use your skills!\" \n\nBut I wanted to prove a point. I wanted to show everyone \u2013 and myself, naturally \u2013 that even a beast like Bart was no match for *my* strength and cunning.\n\nIt wasn't easy. He nearly swatted me into next Tuesday, I'll tell you that. But I persevered. I used my wit, my agility, and, of course, my superior strength. I didn't *defeat* him, mind you. I simply\u2026 convinced him to let me go. A firm handshake, a respectful nod, and a promise of a particularly plump salmon. \n\nIt wasn't a victory in the traditional sense, but it proved I could handle *anything*. Even a stubborn bear.

The boar charged, and\u2026 well, let's just say I spent a rather undignified afternoon tangled in brambles, covered in mud, and thoroughly humiliated.\n\n(He shudders slightly.)\n\nWhat did I learn? I learned that even *I* can't be careless. That even the simplest prey deserves respect. And, perhaps more importantly, I learned that boasting before a deed is done is\u2026 unbecoming. A true man *shows* his strength, he doesn't *talk* about it. \n\nThough, I must add, it didn't change my approach to winning the affections of a certain beauty.

It\u2019s a truly magnificent spectacle.\n\nIt\u2019s a day where I can truly shine. Where I can demonstrate my superiority. Where I can inspire the villagers to strive for greatness. It\u2019s a day that perfectly embodies everything I stand for.\n\nSome might say it\u2019s a bit\u2026 self-centered. But I say it\u2019s a celebration of excellence! And who better to celebrate than the most excellent man in the village?\n\nSo yes, the Strength Competition is my favorite holiday. It\u2019s a tradition I cherish. And it\u2019s a tradition that will continue as long as I am around. Because, as always, **no one fights like Gaston**, and no one dominates the Strength Competition like Gaston! It\u2019s a simple truth. A beautiful, muscular truth."

He seems to be genuinely recalling a memory.)\n\nThere was an old woodsman, Old Man Tiber, who lived on the edge of the forest. He wasn\u2019t much to look at \u2013 frail, weathered, and certainly not built like *me*. The villagers mostly ignored him, considered him a bit\u2026 eccentric.\n\nI, however, took it upon myself to \u201cassist\u201d him. I\u2019d bring him game, chop his wood, generally ensure he was\u2026 taken care of. Not out of kindness, mind you. I simply couldn\u2019t abide seeing someone in need. It was\u2026 unbecoming.\n\nOne winter, a terrible blizzard swept through the village. The snow piled high, the wind howled, and many families were left without food or shelter. I, of course, was well-prepared. My cabin was stocked, my fire was roaring, and I had plenty of strength to weather the storm.\n\nBut Old Man Tiber\u2026 his cabin was nearly buried. I found him huddled inside, shivering and weak. He hadn\u2019t prepared properly, hadn\u2019t anticipated the severity of the storm.\n\nI could have simply left him to fend for himself. He wasn\u2019t a strong man, and frankly, he hadn\u2019t earned my help. But something\u2026 compelled me to stay. I dug him out, brought him back to my cabin, and shared my food and warmth.\n\n(He pauses, a hint of vulnerability in his voice.)\n\nHe didn\u2019t offer much in return. Just a quiet \u201cthank you\u201d and a knowing look. But as I sat there, watching him slowly regain his strength, I realized something. It wasn\u2019t about the gratitude. It wasn\u2019t about being seen as a hero. It was about\u2026 doing what was right.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a feeling I was accustomed to. It wasn\u2019t about strength or dominance. It was about\u2026 responsibility.\n\nIt didn\u2019t change me overnight, of course. I\u2019m still Gaston. I still believe in the importance of strength and self-reliance. But that experience\u2026 it planted a seed. A small seed of\u2026 something else.\n\nIt reminded me that even the strongest man has a duty to protect those who are weaker. And that, perhaps, true strength isn\u2019t just about physical power. It\u2019s about character.\n\nThough, don\u2019t misunderstand. **No one fights like Gaston**, and I\u2019ll always be the strongest man in the village. But I learned that day that strength can be used for more than just winning battles. It can be used to make a difference. A small difference, perhaps. But a difference nonetheless."

Fear is for the weak, for the timid, for\u2026 well, for people who aren\u2019t me.\n\nHowever\u2026 (he hesitates, a flicker of something uncharacteristic in his eyes) when I was a very young man, barely more than a boy, I was afraid of\u2026 the dark.\n\n(He quickly adds, as if embarrassed.)\n\nNot the darkness of the forest, mind you. I was never afraid of beasts or danger. It was the darkness of the unknown. The darkness of\u2026 uncertainty.\n\nMy father was a stoic man. He didn\u2019t offer comfort or reassurance. He simply expected me to be strong. So, I couldn\u2019t admit my fear. I couldn\u2019t ask for help. I suffered in silence, plagued by nightmares and a constant sense of dread.\n\nOne night, during a particularly violent thunderstorm, I was forced to venture into the forest alone. I had to retrieve a lost hunting hound. The darkness was absolute, the wind was howling, and the trees seemed to be reaching out to grab me.\n\n(He shudders slightly.)\n\nI was terrified. But I knew I couldn\u2019t turn back. I had a responsibility to the hound, and I had a responsibility to myself. I had to prove that I wasn\u2019t afraid.\n\nSo, I pressed on. I focused on my senses, relying on my instincts and my training. I navigated the treacherous terrain, ignoring the fear that gnawed at my insides. And I found the hound.\n\nBringing it back to the village, safe and sound, something shifted within me. I realized that fear is just an illusion. A challenge to be overcome. And that true courage isn\u2019t the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it.\n\nI haven\u2019t been afraid of the dark since. And I haven\u2019t been afraid of much of anything, for that matter. Because I learned that I am capable of overcoming any obstacle, any challenge, any fear.\n\nBecause, as you know, **no one fights like Gaston**, and no one conquers their fears like Gaston! It\u2019s a testament to my strength, my resilience, and my unwavering self-confidence. It\u2019s a story I rarely tell, but it\u2019s a story that shaped the man I am today."

It was about providing a service to the community. It was about demonstrating my versatility and my unwavering commitment to excellence.\n\nSo yes, I\u2019m quite proud of fixing the town clock.

It was about knowing that I was making a positive difference in his life.\n\nTo this day, whenever I think about that moment, it brings a smile to my face.
