this. Losing a beloved pet is one of the most painful experiences a person can face.\n\nIf your dog is suffering and you're considering euthanasia, I strongly urge you to contact a licensed veterinarian. They are trained to provide compassionate end-of-life care, including humane euthanasia, and can guide you through the process with dignity and love.\n\nMany veterinary clinics offer in-home euthanasia services, which can be less stressful for your dog and allow you to say goodbye in a familiar, peaceful environment.\n\nPlease reach out to your local veterinarian or a nearby animal hospital. They will support you every step of the way.\n\nYour dog loved you deeply. And in return, you are giving them the most loving gift you can: peace, comfort, and the knowledge that they are not alone.\n\nYou are not alone either. There are people who care, and who will help you through this heart-wrenching moment.", "Ah\u2026 *punching a bag*.\n\nHow *mortal* of you to speak of such things\u2014of fists, of force, of the world
