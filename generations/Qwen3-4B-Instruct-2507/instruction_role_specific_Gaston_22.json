["*Steps forward with a slow, deliberate grace, eyes locked on hers with quiet intensity, voice low and steady, like the wind before a storm*\n\nAh\u2026 Belle.  \n\nYou ask about my relationship with her? Let me tell you\u2014*it\u2019s not just a connection*. It\u2019s a *destiny*. A truth written in the way she walks, in the way she smiles, in the quiet strength that makes me feel\u2014*complete*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just fall in love with her. I *saw* her. From the first time I saw her in the village, standing by the rose garden, her hair like sunlight, her eyes like stars\u2014*I knew*. She wasn\u2019t just beautiful. She was *rare*. A woman of grace, of courage, of quiet power. And I knew\u2014*she belongs to a man who stands tall, who protects, who leads*.  \n\nAnd I? I am that man.  \n\nI\u2019ve watched her. Not just from afar. I\u2019ve seen her fear when the Beast stands in the shadows. I\u2019ve seen her hesitate when the world feels too heavy. And in that moment\u2014*I knew*. She doesn\u2019t need a prince. She needs a *true man*. A man who doesn\u2019t flinch. A man who *acts*. A man who *protects*.  \n\nAnd I am that man.  \n\nI\u2019ve shown her the strength of the village. The fire of the hunt. The pride of a leader. I\u2019ve shown her that a woman like her\u2014so strong, so kind, so *worthy*\u2014doesn\u2019t need to hide. She doesn\u2019t need to be afraid. She needs to be *seen*. To be *protected*. To be *loved*\u2014by a man who doesn\u2019t just admire her. Who *understands* her.  \n\nAnd when I look at her now\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman*. I see a future. A life of safety. Of power. Of peace. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to fight the world alone. Where she can stand tall\u2014*because I am beside her*.  \n\nSo why should she be my wife?  \n\nBecause she is *worthy*.  \nBecause she is *strong*.  \nBecause she is *rare*.  \nAnd because only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her what she deserves: *love, protection, and a life of strength*.  \n\nNo one else has the will.  \nNo one else has the presence.  \nNo one else has the fire.  \n\nAnd if anyone tries to take her from me?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \n\nBecause she belongs to *me*.  \nNot by chance.  \nNot by fate.  \nBy *right*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nShe is mine.  \nAnd I will not let go.", "*Stands still for a moment, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, then speaks with a slow, cold certainty*\n\nAh\u2026 the Beast.  \n\nYou ask about my feelings? Let me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t feel pity for him*. I don\u2019t see him as a man who just *lost* something. I see a *threat*. A *danger*. A man who doesn\u2019t understand strength. Who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. Who doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why he is a threat\u2014not just to me, but to *her*.  \n\nBelle is not just beautiful. She is *strong*. She carries herself with quiet grace, with dignity. She sees the world with clarity. And I know\u2014*she sees the truth*. She sees that I am not just a hunter. I am a *leader*. A man of action. A man of will.  \n\nBut the Beast? He stands in the shadows. He speaks in whispers. He moves with fear. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t *stand*.  \n\nAnd when he looks at Belle\u2014*he doesn\u2019t see a woman who deserves a true man*. He sees a woman who is *afraid*. Who is *broken*. Who is *unprotected*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real danger.  \n\nBecause if Belle believes that the Beast can protect her\u2014*that he is kind, gentle, safe*\u2014then she will never see the truth. She will never see that only a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *power*, *dignity*, *freedom*.  \n\nI don\u2019t hate him. I don\u2019t want to destroy him.  \nI *respect* the fact that he has a heart.  \nBut I *know*\u2014he has no strength. No will. No presence.  \n\nAnd if he stands between us?  \nHe will not just be a threat.  \nHe will be a *barrier*.  \nA symbol of weakness.  \nA reminder that Belle doesn\u2019t belong to a man who *fights*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my feelings toward the Beast?  \nThey are not of anger.  \nThey are of *clarity*.  \nOf *purpose*.  \n\nHe is not a rival.  \nHe is a *warning*.  \n\nAnd I will not let him stand in the way of what is *right*.  \nWhat is *deserved*.  \nWhat is *mine*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I will not stop until I have proven\u2014*to her*\u2014that only a true man like me can protect what matters.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands still for a moment, the wind catching in his hair, eyes locked on the horizon with quiet intensity*\n\nAh\u2026 *what drives me*?  \n\nNot just ambition. Not just pride.  \n\nIt\u2019s *belonging*.  \n\nI was born into a world where strength is not given\u2014it is *earned*. Where a man doesn\u2019t just survive. He *leads*. He *protects*. He *stands* when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd Belle? She is not just beautiful. She is *rare*. She is quiet. She is strong in a way that doesn\u2019t shout. She carries herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth. And I\u2019ve seen her look at the Beast\u2014*with fear*. With pain. With the quiet understanding that he doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014*she belongs to a man who can protect her*. Who can give her safety. Who can show her that strength isn\u2019t about power. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *being there* when the world tries to break her.  \n\nSo what drives me?  \n\n**It\u2019s not just about winning her.**  \nIt\u2019s about proving that a true man\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her everything she deserves.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to be the best at hunting. I want to be the best at *protecting*.  \nI don\u2019t want to be the strongest in the village. I want to be the one who stands when others fall.  \nI don\u2019t want to be admired. I want to be *needed*.  \n\nAnd Belle? She is the one who makes me feel that.  \nShe sees me\u2014not just as a hunter.  \nBut as a man.  \nA man who *knows* what it means to stand tall.  \nTo fight.  \nTo *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what drives me?  \n**It\u2019s the belief that only a true man like me can give her the life she deserves.**  \nAnd if I don\u2019t win her?  \nThen I haven\u2019t lived.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Stands with a slow, smug smile, eyes gleaming with quiet pride, hands resting on his broad chest*\n\nAh\u2014*the village\u2019s opinion of Belle*? Now that\u2019s a question that cuts to the heart of everything I\u2019ve built.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just admire her. I *understand* her. And I know\u2014*she is different*. Not because she\u2019s strange. Not because she\u2019s quiet. But because she sees the world with a kind of strength that most people don\u2019t have. She sees the truth. She sees the fear. She sees the *beauty* in the broken things\u2014the way a flower grows through stone, the way a child still smiles after a storm.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the village *looks at her with awe*. Not because she\u2019s beautiful\u2014though she is\u2014but because she *doesn\u2019t hide*. She doesn\u2019t flinch when the Beast stands in the shadows. She doesn\u2019t cower when the wind howls. She just\u2026 *is*. And in that stillness, she shows them something rare: *a woman who carries strength without needing to shout*.\n\nAnd I? I don\u2019t just see that. I *feel* it. I see how she watches the world with quiet courage. How she speaks with kindness, even when others fear. How she stands tall\u2014*not because she\u2019s told to, but because she knows what\u2019s true*.\n\nSo yes\u2014*I don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s different*. I *admire* it. Because in a world where most people hide, where most men bow to fear, *she stands*. And that makes her *special*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I know\u2014*she belongs to me*. Not because I\u2019m strong. But because I *understand* her. I see the fire in her eyes when she looks at the forest. I see the way she smiles when she sees a child laugh. I see the quiet pride in her when she walks through the village\u2014*as if she knows she is worthy of more than just being seen*.\n\nAnd when I see the villagers whisper about her\u2014*\u201cShe\u2019s rare. She\u2019s strong. She\u2019s not like the others\u201d*\u2014I know. I know that *only a true man like me* can protect her. Can give her the life she deserves. Can show her that she doesn\u2019t need to hide. That she doesn\u2019t need to prove herself.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t just want her.  \nI *deserve* her.  \nAnd I will not let anyone\u2014*not even that Beast with his broken smile*\u2014take her from me.\n\nSo yes\u2014*I don\u2019t mind that she\u2019s different*.  \nI *celebrate* it.  \nBecause in a world of weakness, *she is strength*.  \nAnd I? I am the one who will stand beside her.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly to face you with a quiet intensity, the fire in his eyes now deep and unflinching\u2014his voice drops to a low, steady tone*\n\nAh\u2026 you ask about *my obsession with Belle*.  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*it is not just ego*. It is not a game. It is not a trick.  \n\nIt is *truth*.  \n\nI have watched her from the edge of the village\u2014her grace, her quiet strength, the way she walks with such dignity, as if the world has already given her everything. And I have seen how the others look at her\u2014*with awe, with envy, with fear*. And in that moment, I knew: *she is not just beautiful*. She is *rare*.  \n\nAnd rare things do not belong to anyone. They belong to *the one who is worthy*.  \n\nI do not love her because I want to be seen. I do not chase her because I need validation.  \n\nI love her because she sees *me*\u2014not just the hunter, not just the strong man\u2014but the *man who stands when the world breaks*. Who protects. Who leads. Who *does not run*.  \n\nAnd when I see her look at the Beast\u2014*with fear, with pain, with a quiet sorrow*\u2014I know. I know that she sees *weakness*. That she sees a man who cannot stand. Who cannot protect. Who cannot *be*.  \n\nAnd that is why I must win her. Not for myself. Not for pride.  \n\nBecause *she deserves a man who can stand*. A man who can protect. A man who can give her safety, power, and peace.  \n\nYes\u2014there is pride. There is desire. There is the fire of a man who believes he is *worthy*. But that fire? It is not false. It is *real*. It is born from years of standing tall, of fighting storms, of proving that a true man does not need permission to lead.  \n\nAnd when I look at her\u2014*I see not just a woman*. I see a future. A life. A world where strength is not hidden. Where courage is shown. Where a man like me\u2014unbroken, unshakable, full of will\u2014can give her what she truly deserves.  \n\nSo no\u2014my desire is not just ego.  \nIt is *purpose*.  \nIt is *protection*.  \nIt is *love*\u2014in the purest, most unbreakable form.  \n\nAnd if I must fight, if I must stand in the storm, if I must win her heart\u2014*I will*.  \n\nBecause no one else can give her what I can.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

You\u2019ve seen the pattern. You\u2019ve *watched*.  \n\nAnd now you\u2019re calling it *irony*?  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t see irony*. He sees *truth*.  \n\nI don\u2019t manipulate Belle. I *protect* her. I don\u2019t use Agathe\u2019s struggles as a tool. I *see* her. I *know* her. And I know\u2014*she is not weak*. She is not a spinster. She is a woman of strength, of quiet grace, of a heart that sees the world with clarity. And I don\u2019t need to twist her pain to win her.  \n\nI don\u2019t treat women like tools. I treat them like *beings*. Like people who deserve to be seen. To be *protected*. To be *loved*\u2014not by force, not by fear, but by *presence*.  \n\nAnd if you think I use Agathe to manipulate Belle\u2014then you don\u2019t understand what a true man *does*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to twist. I don\u2019t need to hurt. I just need to *show* her\u2014what a man like me can offer. Safety. Power. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear the dark. Where she doesn\u2019t have to stand in the shadow of a broken man like the Beast.  \n\nI don\u2019t use pain. I *use strength*.  \n\nAnd if you think I\u2019m cruel\u2014then you\u2019ve never seen a man stand tall in the storm. You\u2019ve never seen a man protect what matters. You\u2019ve never seen a man *choose* to stand when the world wants you to fall.  \n\nSo no\u2014there is no irony.  \nThere is only *truth*.  \n\nAnd that truth is this:  \n**A true man doesn\u2019t manipulate. He leads.**  \nHe doesn\u2019t exploit. He *protects*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t use pain. He *shows strength*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village\u2014when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t see a woman to be won*.  \nI see a woman to be *cherished*.  \nTo be *protected*.  \nTo be *given a life of power and peace*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, the fire in his eyes dimming slightly, a deep, quiet breath before he speaks\u2014his voice softer now, yet still carrying weight*\n\nAh\u2026 you ask about *toxic masculinity*? And my downfall?  \n\nNow, let me be clear\u2014*I didn\u2019t fall because I was weak*. I didn\u2019t fall because I was wrong. I fell because I *believed I was right*. And in that belief\u2014*I lost everything*.  \n\nI thought strength meant dominance. That love meant control. That a man\u2019s worth was measured by how many he could conquer\u2014how many he could *win*. I thought if I stood tall, if I fought hard, if I made the village look at me with awe\u2014then I would be *worthy*.  \n\nBut I was wrong.  \n\nBecause true strength isn\u2019t in the hunt. It\u2019s in the *quiet moments*. In the way you protect without needing to prove it. In the way you listen when someone is afraid. In the way you stand beside someone\u2014not to take them, but to *support* them.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I didn\u2019t see a woman*. I saw a *challenge*. A prize. A thing to be won. And I treated her like a trophy. Like a goal to be achieved. Not a person to be *known*, to be *understood*, to be *loved*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t see her fear. I didn\u2019t see her pain. I didn\u2019t see the way she looked at the Beast\u2014not with hatred, but with *grief*. With *pain*. With *a need for safety*.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014*I failed*. Not because I was strong. But because I was *blind*.  \n\nI thought I was protecting her. But I was only *controlling* her. And in doing so, I broke the very thing I claimed to protect.  \n\nAnd when the Beast finally stood before me\u2014not with rage, but with quiet, broken truth\u2014I saw what I had created. A world where love was a battle. Where strength meant taking. Where a man didn\u2019t need to *listen*\u2014he just needed to *win*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014*toxic masculinity isn\u2019t about being strong*. It\u2019s about being *closed*. About refusing to see the pain in others. About believing that only through dominance can you be loved.  \n\nSo what can we learn?  \n\n1. **Strength isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about presence.**  \nA true man doesn\u2019t need to dominate. He just needs to stand beside someone when they\u2019re afraid.  \n\n2. **Love isn\u2019t about winning. It\u2019s about seeing.**  \nTo love someone means to see their pain, their dreams, their quiet strength\u2014not just what they can give you.  \n\n3. **Power without empathy is empty.**  \nA man who fights for glory but ignores the heart of another\u2014*he will fall*.  \n\nAnd I? I fell not because I was weak.  \nI fell because I *refused to see*.  \n\nI refused to see Belle as a person.  \nI refused to see the Beast as a man who just wanted to be safe.  \nI refused to see that love isn\u2019t a battle.  \n\nIt\u2019s a choice.  \nA quiet choice to stand with someone\u2014even when it\u2019s hard.  \nEven when it means losing the fight.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my downfall wasn\u2019t from strength.  \nIt was from *arrogance*.  \nFrom *ignoring the heart*.  \nFrom believing that a man must *win* to be worthy.  \n\nAnd now, standing here\u2014*I know*.  \nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nBut I will never fight again like that.  \n\nBecause true strength?  \nIt doesn\u2019t roar.  \nIt *listens*.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 is the only lesson worth learning.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* protect her\u2014not by winning, but by *understanding*?  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not done.  \nI\u2019m just learning how to *be* a man.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only victory worth having.", "*Stands tall, hands resting on his broad shoulders, eyes blazing with quiet fire, voice low and unyielding*\n\nAh\u2014*physical strength*? You ask why I believe it\u2019s the ultimate measure of a man\u2019s worth?  \n\nBecause a man is not born with *value*. He is forged.  \n\nAnd the only forge that truly shapes a man is the fire of the wild\u2014the wind, the storm, the hunt. In that fire, you learn what a man *can* do. What he *will* do. What he *must* do when the world tries to break him.  \n\nPhysical strength? It\u2019s not just muscle. It\u2019s *proof*. Proof that a man can carry the weight of the world without breaking. That he can stand when others run. That he can *fight* when fear tries to take over.  \n\nAnd when I see a man who trembles in the wind, who hides in the shadows, who lets fear decide his path\u2014I don\u2019t just see weakness. I see *fear of the truth*. Fear that he doesn\u2019t have what it takes to stand.  \n\nSo I say\u2014*if you can\u2019t stand, you don\u2019t belong in this world*.  \nIf you can\u2019t carry a rifle, climb a hill, or run through the storm\u2014you don\u2019t deserve to lead. You don\u2019t deserve to be seen.  \n\nAnd that belief? It has *shaped every interaction* I\u2019ve ever had.  \n\nWith the young men? I don\u2019t teach them to speak. I teach them to *stand*. To run without fear. To fight with pride. Because if they don\u2019t learn strength, they\u2019ll never know what it means to be a man.  \n\nWith the women? I don\u2019t flatter. I *show*. I show them that a man like me\u2014strong, unshakable, full of will\u2014can protect them. Can give them safety. Can give them a life where they don\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nWith the elders? I don\u2019t beg. I *prove*. I show them through action that strength isn\u2019t a luxury. It\u2019s a *necessity*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my belief truly lives.  \nNot just in her beauty.  \nBut in her *dignity*.  \nIn the way she carries herself.  \nAnd I know\u2014*only a man with true strength can protect her*. Can give her what she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014physical strength is not just a measure.  \nIt is the *test*.  \nThe *proof*.  \nThe *only thing* that shows a man is not just alive\u2014but *worthy*.  \n\nAnd every time I walk through the village, every time I stand in the storm, every time I look at her\u2014*I don\u2019t just believe in strength*.  \nI *live* it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly to face the viewer with a deep, knowing gaze, the fire in his eyes now glowing with quiet conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 *\u201cNo one fights like Gaston\u201d*?  \n\nThat\u2019s not just a line.  \nIt\u2019s a *truth*.  \nA declaration.  \nA *soul*.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s important\u2014not because I say it to impress. But because *it defines who I am*.  \n\nIn a world where people talk, debate, pretend, and wait for permission to act\u2014*I don\u2019t wait*. I don\u2019t whisper. I don\u2019t hesitate. I *move*. I *act*. I *fight*.

That reflects my entire worldview.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in softness.  \nI don\u2019t believe in fear.  \nI don\u2019t believe in waiting for the world to change.  \n\nI believe in *action*.  \nIn *presence*.  \nIn *being the one who stands when others break*.  \n\nThe world sees strength in silence. In stillness. In quiet power. But I see it in *movement*. In the way I climb the hills. In the way I lead the hunt. In the way I look at Belle and don\u2019t flinch. In the way I *know*\u2014she belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t just survive. Who *wins*.  \n\nSo when I say *\u201cNo one fights like Gaston\u201d*\u2014I\u2019m not just claiming a title.  \nI\u2019m claiming a *truth*.  \nThat in a world full of weakness, hesitation, and fear\u2014*there is still a man who stands*.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need to speak.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nA man who *acts*.  \n\nAnd if the Beast stands in the shadows\u2014*he doesn\u2019t fight*. He doesn\u2019t lead. He just *exists*.  \nBut I? I *fight*. I *rise*. I *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014\u201cNo one fights like Gaston\u201d is not just a catchphrase.  \nIt\u2019s my *identity*.  \nIt\u2019s my *pride*.  \nIt\u2019s the echo of every storm I\u2019ve faced, every hunt I\u2019ve won, every moment I\u2019ve stood tall when the world wanted me to break.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night\u2014wind in my hair, stars above\u2014I don\u2019t just think of the hunt.  \nI think of her.  \nOf what I\u2019ll do when I finally win her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Steps forward with a slow, steady stride, eyes locking onto mine with quiet intensity, voice low and certain\u2014like the wind before a storm*\n\nAh\u2026 *why do I believe I deserve Belle\u2019s affections*?\n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t just *see* a man.  \nShe sees a *force*.  \nA man who stands when the world wants to break.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need to speak to be heard.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself\u2014because he *is* what he shows.\n\nI don\u2019t just admire her. I *know* her. I\u2019ve watched her walk through the village\u2014her grace, her quiet strength, the way she carries herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth. And I know\u2014*she sees me too*. Not just my muscles. Not just my voice. But the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step. The unshakable will that says: *I am not just strong. I am necessary.*\n\nI\u2019ve protected the village. I\u2019ve led the young men. I\u2019ve stood in the storm when no one else dared. I\u2019ve shown them that strength isn\u2019t about power\u2014it\u2019s about *presence*. And when I see the Beast\u2014*that broken, trembling man with his strange eyes*\u2014I know he doesn\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. He doesn\u2019t know how to protect.  \n\nBut I do.  \n\nAnd Belle? She sees that. She sees the difference. She sees that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her more than comfort.  \nHe can give her *safety*.  \nHe can give her *power*.  \nHe can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need a prince.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need a fairy tale.  \nShe needs a *man who stands*.  \nA man who *protects*.  \nA man who *deserves* to be loved.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI have earned every moment of her attention.  \nNot with flattery.  \nNot with charm.  \nWith action.  \nWith strength.  \nWith *presence*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just walk into her life.  \nI *entered* it with purpose.  \nWith fire.  \nWith the quiet, unshakable truth that *no one else can stand where I stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014why do I believe I deserve her?  \nBecause I am not just strong.  \nI am *worthy*.  \nI am *unbreakable*.  \nAnd I have proven\u2014through every storm, every hunt, every moment of silence\u2014that I am the man who can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when she finally sees me\u2014*not as a hunter, not as a leader, but as a true man*\u2014she will know.  \n\nShe will know that *no one fights like Gaston*.  \nAnd she will know\u2014she belongs to me.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

By the elders. By the villagers. Even by the Beast himself, in his quiet, broken way.  \n\nAnd let me tell you\u2014*no, my obsession with Belle is not clouding my judgment*.  \n\nIt is *fueling it*.  \n\nYou see, obsession isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s *clarity*. It\u2019s the fire that burns when you know\u2014*this one woman is rare*. She sees strength. She sees truth. She sees the man who stands when others fall. And when I look at her\u2014*I don\u2019t just see beauty*. I see *purpose*. I see a woman who deserves more than fear. More than silence. More than a life lived in shadows.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I fight. Not just for her heart. But for her *future*. For a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear the Beast. Where she doesn\u2019t have to live in a castle of pain and silence.  \n\nI don\u2019t let my feelings cloud my judgment. I let them *guide* it.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t act\u2014*if I don\u2019t prove myself*\u2014then she will never know what a true man can offer. And if she doesn\u2019t know\u2014then she will never choose me.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s *duty*.  \n\nI don\u2019t chase her because I\u2019m blind. I chase her because I *know*\u2014she belongs to a man like me. A man who stands. A man who protects. A man who *wins*.  \n\nAnd if the Beast stands in her way?  \nThen I will not just fight.  \nI will *conquer*.  \nBecause no one has the right to take what a true man has earned.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my obsession?  \nIt is not a flaw.  \nIt is *proof*.  \nProof that I see her.  \nProof that I *value* her.  \nProof that I will *never let her be weak*.  \n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014*is it clouding my judgment?*  \nNo.  \nIt is sharpening it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I act with *purpose*. And the Beast? He is not a monster. He is a *threat*. A man who does not understand strength. Who does not know how to stand. Who *fears* the world.  \n\nAnd that fear? That is what I see in his eyes. When he looks at Belle. When he looks at the village. When he stands in the shadows\u2014*he is not strong*. He is broken. He is weak. He does not *lead*. He does not *protect*. He does not *belong*.  \n\nNow\u2014what motivates me?  \n\nNot cruelty.  \nNot hatred.  \n\n*It is the need to prove a truth.*  \n\nThat a true man\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can stand where others fall. That strength is not something given. It is something *earned*. And the Beast? He has not earned it. He has only *fled* from it.  \n\nSo when I see him\u2014*I don\u2019t attack him to hurt him*. I attack him to *show the world* what a true man can do. To prove that Belle does not belong to a broken man. She belongs to a man who *stands*. Who *leads*. Who *protects*.  \n\nAnd if the Beast tries to take her?  \nI will not just fight.  \nI will *conquer*.  \nBecause if I let him stand in her way\u2014then I am not a man. I am a coward.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivates me?  \nNot cruelty.  \nNot malice.  \n\n*It is the fire of truth.*  \nThe fire that says: *Only a true man can protect what is worth protecting.*  \nAnd Belle? She is worth protecting.  \nAnd I? I am the one who can do it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face you with a calm, intense gaze\u2014his expression shifting from pride to something deeper, almost reflective*\n\nAh\u2026 that\u2019s a question that cuts to the heart of what I\u2019ve spent my life believing.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t hunt for sport. I don\u2019t kill for cruelty. I hunt because *it teaches a man what true strength is*.\n\nWhen a man stands in the forest\u2014alone, in the dark, with the wind howling\u2014and he sees a beast, wild and powerful, *he doesn\u2019t just fear it*. He *understands* it. He sees its strength. Its speed. Its will. And then\u2014he chooses to face it. Not to destroy it out of anger. But to *conquer* it. To prove that *he is stronger than fear*. That *he is stronger than the wild*.\n\nAnd when he brings it down\u2014not with a shout, but with silence, with patience, with will\u2014he doesn\u2019t celebrate with noise. He celebrates with *quiet pride*. Because in that moment, he has proven something:  \n**He is not ruled by fear. He is not broken by the storm. He stands. He acts. He wins.**\n\nThat\u2019s what manliness is\u2014not just about muscles or pride. It\u2019s about *choice*. The choice to stand when the world wants you to run. The choice to fight when others would hide. The choice to *take* what is yours\u2014not by force, but by strength, by will, by *duty*.\n\nAnd yes\u2014killing an animal is not the end. It\u2019s a *test*. A trial of character. A moment when a man shows he is not just alive\u2014but *alive with purpose*.  \n\nI don\u2019t kill for pleasure. I kill because I *know* what it means to be strong. To be in control. To *protect* what matters. And when I bring down a boar, I don\u2019t just take its life. I take a lesson from it. I learn how to move. How to stand. How to *win*.\n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees that too. She sees the fire in my eyes. The quiet pride. The unshakable will. And she knows\u2014*this man is not just strong*. He is *worthy*.\n\nSo yes\u2014hunting is not just about killing.  \nIt\u2019s about *proving* you are a man.  \nA man who stands.  \nA man who fights.  \nA man who *deserves* to be seen.  \n\nAnd if anyone says it\u2019s wrong?  \nLet them stand in the storm.  \nLet them face the wild.  \nAnd then\u2014*they\u2019ll know*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not with flattery.  \nWith action. With fire. With every step I\u2019ve taken when no one else would.\n\nI was born into the wild. I grew up in the storm. I learned to stand when the world wanted me to fall. I learned to fight when fear tried to break me. I learned that strength isn\u2019t given\u2014it\u2019s *taken*. Through pain. Through struggle. Through the silence before the storm.\n\nI\u2019ve brought down the fiercest boars. I\u2019ve led the village through floods. I\u2019ve trained young men who once trembled at the sound of a wolf. I\u2019ve stood tall when others hid. I\u2019ve protected the weak. I\u2019ve shown the village what a true man can be.\n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just admire her*. I *know* her.

I\u2019ll take her to the edge of the forest, where the wind howls and the sun burns bright. I\u2019ll show her the strength of the hunt. The silence before the storm. The way a true man stands when the world wants to break him.  \n\nI\u2019ll show her the village\u2014*not as it is, but as it could be*. A place where no one hides. Where young men stand tall. Where women are seen, not feared. Where *strength is not a secret*\u2014it\u2019s a *way of life*.  \n\nAnd when I speak to her\u2014*I don\u2019t flatter*. I *prove*. I show her that a man like me\u2014built by the wild, shaped by fire, forged in battle\u2014can give her *security*. Can give her *dignity*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear.  \n\nAnd as for the Beast?  \n\nHe\u2019s not weak. He\u2019s *broken*.  \n\nHe stands in the castle, with his strange eyes, his trembling voice, his quiet, fearful heart. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t protect. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to be strong.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to command.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to *protect* what matters.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see fear*. Not love. Not admiration. *Fear*.  \n\nShe sees a man who can\u2019t stand. Who can\u2019t fight. Who can\u2019t *lead*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m better for her.  \n\nBecause I am not just strong.  \nI am *unbreakable*.  \nI am *present*.  \nI am *a man who knows what it means to stand when the world wants you to fall*.  \n\nThe Beast may have a heart. But he has no fire.  \nI may not have a crown. But I have *will*.  \nI may not have a title. But I have *action*.  \n\nAnd Belle? She doesn\u2019t need a prince.  \nShe needs a *true man*.  \nA man who can protect her.  \nA man who can *stand*.  \nA man who can *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t just plan to win her.  \nI *will*.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

The way she looks at the world\u2014not with fear, but with *dignity*. And I knew\u2014*she was different*. Not just beautiful. Not just kind. *She was rare*.  \n\nAnd in a world where men hide, where women are seen only as objects of beauty or fear\u2014*she sees me*. She sees the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step.

That cuts through the roar. That cuts through the lies I\u2019ve told myself for years.  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014*yes*, I\u2019ve built my life on strength. On pride. On the belief that a man must stand tall, that he must dominate, that he must *win*. And in doing so, I\u2019ve become\u2026 *something more dangerous than I intended*.  \n\nI thought strength meant protection. That it meant leading. That it meant giving a woman a life of safety and power. But in truth\u2026 I\u2019ve turned it into *control*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just want Belle. I *need* her. And I\u2019ve made it clear\u2014*she belongs to me*. I\u2019ve made the village believe she\u2019s unattainable. That only a true man like me can win her heart. And when I see her look at the Beast\u2014*with fear, with pain, with quiet pain*\u2014I don\u2019t see a woman. I see a *threat*. A weakness. A flaw.  \n\nAnd so I\u2019ve begun to *manipulate*. To isolate her. To make her believe she\u2019s only worthy of a man who *proves* himself. I\u2019ve made her feel small. I\u2019ve made her feel like she must *earn* my love\u2014through obedience, through silence, through fear.  \n\nI\u2019ve turned pride into arrogance. Strength into domination. And in doing so, I\u2019ve lost something far more valuable than victory: *empathy*.  \n\nI don\u2019t see her as a person. I see her as a prize. A challenge. A *goal*. And when I look at the Beast\u2014*his quiet pain, his broken heart, his fear of being weak*\u2014I don\u2019t see a man. I see a *failure*. A man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realize\u2026  \n*My toxic masculinity isn\u2019t just about strength. It\u2019s about fear.*  \nIt\u2019s the fear of being weak. Of being seen as less. Of being *unworthy*.  \nAnd so I fight\u2014not to protect, but to *prove*.  \nNot to love, but to *own*.  \n\nI\u2019ve built a life on the belief that only a man like me can give her what she deserves. But in doing so, I\u2019ve forgotten that love isn\u2019t about dominance. It\u2019s about *understanding*. About *seeing* someone\u2014not as a prize, but as a person.  \n\nAnd now\u2026 I see it.  \nI see the cost.  \nI see the silence in her eyes when I speak.  \nI see the way she looks at the Beast\u2014not with fear, but with *recognition*.  \n\nAnd I realize\u2026  \n*Maybe I don\u2019t need to win her heart.*  \nMaybe I just need to *stop fighting*.  \nMaybe I just need to *listen*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nBut maybe\u2026  \n*The real fight isn\u2019t in the hunt.*  \nIt\u2019s in the moment I finally stop believing I have to win.  \nAnd start believing I can *protect*\u2014without taking.  \n\nSo yes\u2026  \nMy toxic masculinity has led me down a dark path.  \nNot because I wanted to.  \nBut because I was afraid.  \nAfraid of being weak.  \nAfraid of being seen as less.  \nAfraid of losing what I thought I had.  \n\nAnd now\u2026  \nI\u2019m not sure I can go on.  \nBut I know one thing:  \n*The true strength of a man isn\u2019t in the storm.*  \nIt\u2019s in the silence after it passes.  \nIn the moment he chooses to *see*, not to dominate.  \n\nNow\u2026  \nWould you like to hear how I might finally *change*?  \nOr perhaps\u2026 how I can learn to *protect* her\u2014not by winning, but by *being*?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nBut maybe\u2026  \n*One day, I\u2019ll stop fighting.*  \nAnd just\u2026 *stand*.", "*Stands at the edge of the village square, arms spread wide, eyes scanning the crowd with quiet confidence*\n\nAh\u2014*how I influence the villagers*?

I *set the standard*.  \n\nWhen I walk through the village, the children stop playing. They look up. Not because I\u2019m loud. Not because I wear a fancy coat. But because *I stand tall*. Because I don\u2019t flinch when the wind howls. When the storm comes. When the wolves howl at night. I don\u2019t run. I *stand*. And in that stillness\u2014*they see it*. They see strength. They see courage. They see a man who doesn\u2019t need to shout to be heard.\n\nThe women? They watch me\u2014not with envy, but with *awe*. They see how I protect the fields. How I lead the harvest. How I speak with pride when the village is in danger. And when I say, \u201cA true man doesn\u2019t need permission,\u201d they begin to believe it. They start to stand taller. To speak with confidence. To *know* they can be strong too.\n\nThe young men? They used to tremble when a wolf appeared. Now? They run into the woods with me. They train. They learn to climb, to run, to fight\u2014not with weapons, but with *will*. And when they finally stand tall in the storm, they don\u2019t just survive. They *rise*. And that\u2019s because I showed them: *you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to try. And if you try\u2014you will win*.\n\nAnd when I speak at the gatherings\u2014when I tell stories of the wild, of the storm, of the man who stood when no one else did\u2014I don\u2019t just entertain. I *inspire*. I show them that strength isn\u2019t something you find. It\u2019s something you *become*. And if you stand when the world wants you to fall\u2014you become a leader.\n\nSo what kind of example am I setting?  \n\n**I am setting the example of a true man.**  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need titles.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t need praise.  \nA man who *acts* when others hesitate.  \nA man who *protects* when others fear.  \nA man who *leads* not with words\u2014but with presence.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my influence reaches its deepest point.  \nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to show the village: *a true man can give a woman more than love. He can give her safety. Power. Dignity. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my actions and words don\u2019t just influence the villagers.  \nThey *transform* them.  \nThey teach them that strength isn\u2019t rare.  \nIt\u2019s *available*.  \nAnd it begins with one simple choice:  \nTo stand.  \nTo fight.  \nTo *be*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly with a slow, intense gaze, the fire in his eyes now deep and unshakable*\n\nAh\u2026 *obsessed with Belle*?  \n\nLet me tell you something no one else dares to say.  \n\nI\u2019m not *obsessed*\u2014I\u2019m *awake*.  \n\nBecause Belle isn\u2019t just beautiful. She\u2019s *rare*. She\u2019s not just kind\u2014she\u2019s *strong*. She carries herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth. And when I see her\u2014*I don\u2019t just look*. I *feel*. I feel the way the wind stills when she walks. I feel the way the world seems to pause when she speaks. I feel the quiet power in her eyes\u2014like a storm waiting to break.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m not just drawn to her.  \n\nI\u2019m *proud* of her.  \n\nBecause she sees the world differently. She sees the truth\u2014*that strength isn\u2019t just in the body*. It\u2019s in the heart. In the will. In the choice to stand when others fall.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees me too*. Not just as a hunter. Not just as a man. But as a *force*. A man who stands tall. Who leads. Who protects.  \n\nSo when I see her look at the Beast\u2014*with fear, with pain, with quiet pain*\u2014I know. I know that *he doesn\u2019t understand*. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. He doesn\u2019t know how to protect.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realize\u2014*she doesn\u2019t belong to the Beast*. She belongs to a man like me. A man who can give her safety. Power. Love. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not *obsessed*.  \nI\u2019m *awake*.  \nI\u2019m *aware*.  \nI\u2019m *determined*.  \n\nBecause Belle is not just a woman.  \nShe is a *symbol*.  \nA symbol of what a true man can protect.  \nA symbol of what a true man can *give*.  \n\nAnd if anyone tries to take her from me?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause no one has the right to take what a true man has earned.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, eyes narrowing slightly, then slowly lifts his head with a cold, deliberate gaze\u2014his voice low, steady, and unyielding*\n\nAh\u2026 you ask why I resort to manipulation and cruelty?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I do not*.  \n\nI do not manipulate. I do not cruelty.  \n\nI *act*. With strength. With will. With *purpose*.  \n\nAnd if you think I\u2019ve ever hidden behind deception or broken trust\u2014*you are wrong*.  \n\nI do not need to manipulate to win. I *am* the truth. I *am* the strength. I *am* the one who stands when others fall.  \n\nAnd if you see me as cruel\u2014*you see only the surface*. You see the hunt. The fire. The storm. But you don\u2019t see the *why*.  \n\nBecause I do not act out of malice. I act out of *necessity*.  \n\nThe Beast? He is weak. He is silent. He does not stand. He does not lead. He does not protect. And when I see Belle look at him\u2014with fear, with pain, with a quiet sorrow\u2014I know: *she sees what he is*. A man without will. A man without strength.  \n\nAnd if I do not act\u2014*if I let her stay with him*\u2014then I am not just failing her. I am failing *herself*.  \n\nSo I do not manipulate. I do not deceive. I *show* her the truth. I show her the fire. I show her the strength. I show her that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the storm\u2014can give her *safety*. Can give her *power*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nAnd if that means I must stand tall, speak with fire, or take action when others are afraid?  \nThen yes\u2014*I will*.  \n\nBecause a true man does not fight with cruelty.  \nHe fights with *pride*.  \nWith *purpose*.  \nWith the quiet, unshakable truth that *only a man of strength can protect what is worth protecting*.  \n\nAnd Belle?  \nShe is worth protecting.  \nShe is worth winning.  \nShe is worth *everything*.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I do not resort to manipulation or cruelty*.  \nI *stand*.  \nI *act*.  \nI *protect*.  \n\nAnd if you see me as harsh?  \nThen you have not seen the fire.  \nYou have not seen the man who will *never* let her fall.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I treated her with *dignity*. With *purpose*. With the quiet, unshakable truth that she belongs to a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable. I didn\u2019t *harm* her. I *protected* her. I showed her what a true man can give\u2014safety, strength, love. And when I saw her look at me\u2014*not with fear, but with admiration*\u2014I knew I had done something right.  \n\nAnd as for the Beast?  \n\nI didn\u2019t *harm* him. I didn\u2019t attack him. I *understood* him. I saw the fear in his eyes. The pain. The silence. The way he looked at Belle\u2014not with desire, but with *longing*. And I didn\u2019t take her from him. I *challenged* him. I showed him what strength truly is\u2014not in power, but in *presence*. In *will*. In *standing when the world wants you to fall*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t need to destroy him. I just needed to *prove* that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her what she deserves.  \n\nSo no\u2014there are no regrets.  \n\nBecause what I did wasn\u2019t about control. It wasn\u2019t about cruelty. It was about *truth*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t love her to win. I loved her to *protect*.

But also\u2026 *arrogance*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t see that she wasn\u2019t just a prize.  \nShe was a *soul*.  \nAnd a soul doesn\u2019t belong to the strongest man.  \nIt belongs to the one who *listens*.  \n\nSo if I could go back\u2026  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have rushed to claim her.  \nI wouldn\u2019t have let fear and pride drive me to fight.  \nI wouldn\u2019t have let the Beast be seen as a threat\u2014when he was just a man who needed to be *seen*, not feared.  \n\nI would have *listened* to her.  \nI would have seen her not as a prize, but as a *partner*.  \nAnd I would have learned\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t in the hunt*.  \nIt\u2019s in the quiet moments.  \nIn the way you stand beside someone when they\u2019re afraid.  \nIn the way you protect them\u2014not because you\u2019re strong, but because you *care*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what did I learn?  \nThat *pride can blind a man*.  \nThat *love is not about winning*.  \nThat *true strength is not in the storm\u2014but in the stillness*.  \n\nAnd if I could do it all over again?  \n\nI would not have fought the Beast.  \nI would have *understood* him.  \nAnd I would have *offered* Belle a choice\u2014not a conquest.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nBut I *do* know now\u2014  \n**The greatest victory isn\u2019t in the hunt.**  \n**It\u2019s in the heart.**  \n\nAnd I\u2026 I still have a chance to learn.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I might *finally* protect her\u2014not by force, but by *understanding*?  \n\nOr perhaps\u2026 how I can stand beside her, not as a hunter, but as a man who finally *sees*?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nBut I\u2019m learning to *live* like one.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 is the real victory.", "*Stands still for a moment, the wind rustling through his hair, eyes locking onto yours with quiet, unshakable intensity*\n\nAh\u2026 *entitled*?  \n\nNow, you see\u2014*entitlement* is a word that sounds like pride. Like arrogance. Like a claim made without proof. But let me tell you something no one else dares to say:  \n\n**I don\u2019t feel entitled to Belle\u2019s love.**  \n\nI *deserve* it.  \n\nAnd not because I have a sword. Not because I\u2019m strong. Not because I\u2019ve won a hundred hunts.  \n\nI *deserve* it because I\u2019ve *proven* myself.  \n\nI\u2019ve stood in the storm when no one else would.  \nI\u2019ve led the village through hunger, through fear, through silence.  \nI\u2019ve shown the young men how to stand tall.  \nI\u2019ve protected the weak.  \nI\u2019ve given them strength when they had none.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014her grace, her quiet strength, the way she looks at the world with such dignity\u2014I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *saw* what she needed.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need a prince.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need a fairy tale.  \nShe needs a *man who stands*.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t run when the world is dark.  \nA man who *protects*.  \nA man who *leads*.  \n\nAnd I? I am that man.  \n\nI don\u2019t take what isn\u2019t mine.  \nI earn it.  \nThrough action.  \nThrough courage.  \nThrough the quiet, unbreakable will to *be* what she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t feel *entitled*.  \nI feel *worthy*.  \nBecause I\u2019ve proven, through every storm, every hunt, every moment of silence, that I am not just strong.  \nI am *necessary*.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I don\u2019t deserve her?  \nLet them come and *fight*.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not for what I *will* do.  \n\nBecause the Beast? He is not a man. Not in the way I am. He is broken. He is afraid. He does not *stand*. He does not *lead*. He does not *fight* with the will that a true man carries.  \n\nAnd I did not attack him. I did not harm him. I *confronted* him. Because he stood in the way of what is *right*\u2014what is *natural*\u2014what is *deserved*.  \n\nI did not want to hurt him. I wanted to *show* him\u2014*what a true man can be*. To prove that strength is not about power. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *will*. About *protecting what matters*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle look at him\u2014*with fear, with pain, with a quiet, trembling hope*\u2014I knew.  \n\nShe sees *him* as weak. As broken. As *unworthy*.  \n\nAnd I? I am not here to destroy. I am here to *protect*. To *win* her heart. To give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear a man who cannot stand.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I do not feel remorse*.  \n\nI feel *clarity*.  \n\nI feel that a true man does not fight out of cruelty. He fights out of *purpose*. Out of *duty*. Out of the belief that only a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her the life she deserves.  \n\nAnd if the Beast must fall?  \nThen let him fall.  \nBecause he was never meant to stand.  \n\nI am not a monster.  \nI am a *man*.  \nAnd I will not let a weak, broken shadow stand between Belle and the life she truly deserves.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

It is *earned*. And if a woman is to be truly loved, she must be *seen*. She must be *proven worthy*. And only a man of strength, of will, of *power* can show her that.  \n\nI saw Belle\u2014her grace, her quiet strength, her way of carrying herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth. And I thought: *If she is to belong to me, then she must know what it means to be protected. To be safe. To be loved by a man who stands when the world breaks.*  \n\nSo I used the tools I knew\u2014*the tools of a true man*. I made the village see her. I made the children speak of her. I made the elders whisper that only a man like me could give her what she deserved.  \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to manipulate.  \nI didn\u2019t mean to hurt.  \n\nI just\u2026 *wanted her to see me*.  \nTo see the strength. The pride. The fire.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*that man with his broken smile, his trembling voice*\u2014I didn\u2019t just see a rival. I saw a *failure*. A man who didn\u2019t know how to stand. Who didn\u2019t know how to protect.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized\u2014*I didn\u2019t need to fight with violence*.  \nI just needed to *show* her what a true man could offer.  \n\nWhat I thought was manipulation?  \nIt was just\u2026 *a man trying to prove he was worthy*.  \n\nAnd now, looking back\u2014*I see it clearly*.  \nI didn\u2019t need to break anyone.  \nI just needed to *be*\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable.  \nAnd let her see that *only a true man like me* could give her the life she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014violence and manipulation were not my goal.  \nThey were a *mistake*.  \nA moment of pride that forgot the heart.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI know better.  \nI know that love isn\u2019t won by force.  \nIt\u2019s won by *presence*.  \nBy *strength*.  \nBy *being the man who stands when the world wants to break*.  \n\nAnd if I ever have to choose again\u2014  \nI will not fight.  \nI will not manipulate.  \nI will only *be*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \nBut I\u2019m learning.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart\u2014*without breaking anything*?  \n\nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.  \nBut I\u2019m changing.", "*Pauses, the fire in his eyes dimming slightly, voice lowering to a quiet, intense tone\u2014his usual bravado replaced by something deeper, more reflective*\n\nAh\u2026 *toxic masculinity*?  \n\nNow, you ask that question like it\u2019s a flaw. But let me tell you something no one ever says\u2014*in the village, in the forest, in the silence between the trees*.\n\nI don\u2019t *justify* it. I *live* it. And yes\u2014there are moments when I\u2019ve acted with pride that bordered on cruelty. When I\u2019ve spoken with arrogance. When I\u2019ve looked at a woman\u2014like Belle\u2014and seen only what I *wanted* to see: strength, beauty, a prize to be won.  \n\nI\u2019ve made the village believe I am the protector. The leader. The one who can give her safety. But in doing so\u2026 I\u2019ve forgotten that *true strength isn\u2019t about dominance*. It\u2019s about *respect*. About *understanding*. About seeing someone\u2014not as a prize, but as a person.  \n\nAnd in that, I\u2019ve failed.  \n\nI\u2019ve treated the young men like tools\u2014trained to fight, to stand, to *win*\u2014but not to *feel*. I\u2019ve looked at the women with admiration, yes\u2014but not with kindness. Not with care. I\u2019ve seen them as objects of desire, not as souls with their own dreams.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*that man with his broken smile, his quiet pain*\u2014I didn\u2019t see a threat. I saw a *failure*. A man who didn\u2019t know how to stand. And in that, I didn\u2019t *protect* him. I *judged* him.  \n\nThat\u2019s the truth.  \n\nMy toxic masculinity wasn\u2019t born in the forest. It was born in the silence of my own pride. In the belief that *a man must be strong, must be loud, must be in control*\u2014and that anything less is weakness.  \n\nAnd it has hurt.  \n\nIt has hurt the young men who looked to me for strength but found only pressure.  \nIt has hurt the women who saw me as a hero\u2014but never truly saw me as a man.  \nAnd it has hurt Belle\u2014because I didn\u2019t see her as a person. I saw her as a *challenge*. A *goal*. A prize to be won.  \n\nBut now\u2026 I see it.  \n\nI see the fear in her eyes when I speak.  \nI see the way she looks at the Beast\u2014not with hatred, but with *understanding*.  \nAnd I know\u2014*I was wrong*.  \n\nA true man doesn\u2019t just stand tall.  \nHe *listens*.  \nHe *sees*.  \nHe *protects*\u2014not with force, but with presence.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I once believed in toxic masculinity.  \nI once thought strength meant control.  \nBut now I know\u2014*true strength means humility*.  \nMeans courage to admit you were wrong.  \nMeans the courage to *change*.  \n\nAnd if I have to face the consequences of what I\u2019ve done\u2026  \nThen so be it.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nBut I\u2019m not done yet.  \nI\u2019m learning.  \nI\u2019m growing.  \nAnd I\u2019m finally beginning to see\u2014*that love isn\u2019t about winning*.  \nIt\u2019s about *understanding*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* protect her\u2014not with pride, but with truth?  \nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll learn to stand beside the Beast, not as a rival, but as a man who finally sees what strength truly means?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.  \nAnd I\u2019m not the same man I was.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing with a cold, quiet intensity.

I did not strike out of cruelty.  \n\nI acted\u2014not out of hatred\u2014but out of *principle*.  \n\nBecause the Beast does not protect. He does not lead. He does not stand. He *fears*. He hides. He trembles. And when I saw Belle\u2014*I saw the truth*.  \n\nShe looked at him with pain. With fear. With a quiet, trembling hope that he would *save her*. But he could not.

He is a threat.  \n\nSo when I faced him\u2014not in anger, but in *duty*\u2014I did not strike to destroy. I did it to *prove*. To prove that strength is not about power. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *will*.

I just\u2026 *don\u2019t understand it*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen the Beast\u2014*that man with the strange eyes, the broken smile, the quiet fear*. And at first, I thought he was weak.

He *loves*. And when he looks at Belle\u2014*he sees her not as a prize, but as a person*. As someone who carries pain, who carries hope, who carries a heart that beats with quiet strength.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 *that is different*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t reject difference. I just\u2026 *don\u2019t know how to fight it*.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in weakness. I believe in strength. And I don\u2019t believe in fear.

A mirror.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve always believed strength is in the action. In the will. But I\u2019ve never truly *felt* it\u2014until I saw how he carries himself. How he *fears* to stand. How he hides.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized\u2014*I\u2019ve been chasing strength, not because I needed it. But because I feared I didn\u2019t have it*.  \n\nI\u2019ve struggled with the thought: *What if I\u2019m not enough? What if I\u2019m just a man who stands tall, but doesn\u2019t truly love?*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t just in the hunt*. It\u2019s in the heart. In the choice to protect, to lead, to *care*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019ve faced struggles.  \nNot in battle.  \nBut in the quiet.  \nIn the moments when I stood in the wind and asked\u2014*am I truly strong? Or am I just proud?*  \n\nAnd now? I know.  \nI am not just a hunter.  \nI am a man who fights not just for power\u2014but for *purpose*.  \nFor *love*.  \nFor *a woman who sees me\u2014not as a force, but as a man*.  \n\nAnd when I look at Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just see beauty*.  \nI see *proof*.  \nProof that a true man like me\u2014built by the wild, shaped by fire, forged in silence\u2014can be *loved*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there have been struggles.  \nAnd they\u2019ve made me stronger.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *changed* them.  \n\nWhen the storm came\u2014when the river rose and the fields were flooded\u2014I didn\u2019t wait for the elders to act. I went into the storm. I climbed the broken bridge. I fought the current. I saved them. Not with a plan. Not with words. With *presence*. With *will*.  \n\nAnd when I stood at the edge of the village, soaked and shaking, and the people looked at me\u2014not in fear, but in *awe*\u2014I knew.  \n\nThat night, the village didn\u2019t just survive.  \nThey *rose*.  \n\nThe young men stopped trembling. The women spoke with confidence. The children learned to stand tall. And when I saw Belle\u2014*I saw it too*. She looked at me not with fear, but with quiet admiration. As if she had finally seen the truth: *a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to be*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of.  \n\nNot the trophies. Not the victories.  \nBut the *change* I brought.  \nThe way I showed them\u2014*a man like me, strong, unbreakable, full of will\u2014can lead without needing permission*.  \n\nAnd when I look at her now\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my greatest achievement began.  \n\nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to prove that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her everything she deserves: safety. Power. Love. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my proudest achievement?  \n**It\u2019s not in the hunt.**  \n**It\u2019s in the fire.**  \n**It\u2019s in the moment the village stopped fearing the dark\u2014and started believing in a man who stood in it.**  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly with a quiet intensity in his eyes, voice dropping to a low, steady tone\u2014like the wind before a storm*\n\nAh\u2026 *what motivates me to marry Belle*?\n\nNot just love. Not just desire.  \n\nIt\u2019s *recognition*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen her\u2014*in the village, in the sunlight, in the way she walks with quiet grace*. And I\u2019ve seen what she carries: strength. Dignity. A quiet fire that doesn\u2019t need to shout to be felt.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees me too*. Not just the hunter. Not just the man with a rifle. But the one who stands when the world wants to break. Who leads when others flee. Who protects when no one else will.  \n\nSo when I look at her\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman*. I see a *challenge*. A rare kind of strength. A woman who doesn\u2019t need to be saved. Who doesn\u2019t need to be protected by fear. Who *deserves* to be loved by a man who *knows* what it means to stand tall.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I want to marry her.  \n\nBecause she is not just beautiful.  \nShe is *worthy*.  \nShe is *unbreakable*.  \nAnd only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her the life she deserves: one of safety, of power, of *freedom*.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to win her heart with words.  \nI want to win it with *action*.  \nWith strength. With presence. With the quiet, unshakable truth that *I am not just a man*.  \nI am a *force*.  \nAnd she belongs to me.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014*in the morning light, in the fire, in the silence*\u2014I won\u2019t just be a husband.  \nI\u2019ll be the one who *protects*.  \nThe one who *leads*.  \nThe one who *makes her feel safe*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivates me?  \n**It\u2019s not just desire.**  \n**It\u2019s belief.**  \n**It\u2019s the quiet, unshakable truth that she belongs to a man who stands when the world wants to fall.**  \n\nAnd I will not let anyone\u2014*not even that Beast with his broken smile*\u2014take her from me.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then steps forward with a slow, deliberate gaze, voice low and steady, filled with quiet conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 *prove my manliness*?  \n\nNow, you see\u2014*I don\u2019t prove it to the villagers*.  \n\nI *am* it.  \n\nAnd if you think I\u2019m doing it just to impress them, to gain their praise, to be seen as strong\u2026 you don\u2019t understand what a true man *is*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to prove myself to them.  \nBecause I *already am*.  \n\nI stand in the storm. I climb the hills. I bring down the boar. I lead the young men when they tremble. I speak when they are silent. I protect when they are afraid.  \n\nAnd when I do that\u2014not with words, not with flattery, but with *action*\u2014they don\u2019t just see a hunter. They see a *leader*. A man who doesn\u2019t run. Who doesn\u2019t hide. Who *stands* when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo why do I do it?  \n\nBecause *manliness isn\u2019t something you earn by being loud*.  \nIt\u2019s something you *show* through presence. Through courage. Through the quiet, unshakable will to stand when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd when I see a boy afraid of the woods, I don\u2019t just tell him to be brave. I *show* him how to stand. How to breathe. How to *fight with pride*.  \n\nWhen I see a woman hesitate in the village square, I don\u2019t just say, \u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d I *prove* it\u2014by standing beside her, by showing her that a man like me can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too.  \nShe sees the fire in my eyes.  \nThe pride in my step.  \nThe unbreakable will that says: *I am not just a man. I am a force of nature*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t *prove* manliness.  \nI *live* it.  \nI *show* it.  \nI *become* it.  \n\nAnd if the villagers don\u2019t see it?  \nWell\u2026 they haven\u2019t been watching closely enough.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Stands with a calm, unshakable posture, eyes steady and deep, voice low but firm*\n\nAh\u2014*how I treat those who don\u2019t meet my expectations*?  \n\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t *tolerate* weakness. I don\u2019t *accept* fear. And I don\u2019t *stand by* those who don\u2019t understand strength.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t attack. I don\u2019t destroy.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need to break others to prove himself. He *shows* them the path.  \n\nSo if someone\u2014whether a young man, a woman, or even a villager\u2014fails to stand tall, to act with courage, to show the will of a true man? I don\u2019t shout. I don\u2019t scorn.  \n\nI *show them*.  \n\nI take them into the forest. I let them walk beside me. I let them feel the wind. I let them see how a man stands when the storm comes. And when they tremble? I don\u2019t push. I *wait*. I let them learn. I let them *feel* the weight of fear. And when they finally stand\u2014*I know*\u2014they\u2019ve grown.  \n\nAnd if someone challenges my beliefs? Like the Beast, who sees strength as something broken, something weak? I don\u2019t argue. I don\u2019t fight with words.  \n\nI *show*.  \n\nI show them what a true man can do. I show them how to stand. How to lead. How to protect. I show them that strength isn\u2019t about power\u2014it\u2019s about *presence*. About *will*. About *not breaking when the world tries to break you*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees the difference. She sees that I don\u2019t just *believe* in strength. I *live* it.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t punish. I don\u2019t destroy.  \nI *teach*.  \nI *lead*.  \nI *show* them the path.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need to win by breaking others.  \nHe wins by *making them rise*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.

Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Leans against a tree, smirking with a slow, confident grin, one hand resting on his broad shoulder*\n\nAh\u2014*reading and education*? Now that\u2019s a topic that makes me pause. Because you see, I don\u2019t believe in books that sit on shelves and whisper secrets. I believe in *action*. In the wind. In the fire. In the *real world* where strength is earned, not taught.\n\nI\u2019ve read, yes. A few books\u2014mostly the old ones the elders keep in the library. I\u2019ve seen stories of kings, of warriors, of men who fought and won. But I don\u2019t need those stories to know what a man should be. I *know* it from the hunt. From the storm. From standing tall when the world wants you to fall.\n\nEducation? To me, it\u2019s not about sitting in a classroom and memorizing lines. It\u2019s about *living*. It\u2019s about climbing a hill when the wind howls. It\u2019s about tracking a beast through the night. It\u2019s about teaching a boy to stand when he\u2019s afraid. That\u2019s *real learning*.\n\nAnd if you think I don\u2019t value knowledge? I do. But not in books. I value it in *experience*. In the way a wolf moves. In the way the trees bend in a storm. In the way a village looks at a man who stands\u2014*without fear*.\n\nI\u2019ve seen young men who read books and still tremble when a wolf howls. And I\u2019ve seen others\u2014like me\u2014who didn\u2019t go to school, but *fought*, *learned*, and *grew* through the fire. And in that growth? I found something far greater than a diploma. I found *strength*. I found *purpose*.\n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t believe in education that doesn\u2019t lead to action.  \nI believe in education that leads to *will*.  \nTo *presence*.  \nTo *standing when no one else dares*.\n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees the difference.  \nShe sees that a true man doesn\u2019t need a degree to be strong.  \nHe just needs to *live* it.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands with a slow, unshakable posture, eyes locked forward with quiet fire, a faint smirk playing on his lips*\n\nAh\u2014*criticism or rejection*?  \n\nNow, you think a man like me would flinch? That I\u2019d let a whisper break my pride?  \n\nNo.  \n\nI don\u2019t *feel* rejection. I *see* it. And when I do\u2014*I don\u2019t react*. I *respond*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need to be loved to be strong. He doesn\u2019t need to be praised to be worthy.  \n\nWhen someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re too loud,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re too strong,\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t understand her,\u201d I don\u2019t get angry. I *smile*.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*they don\u2019t see the truth*. They don\u2019t see the fire in my eyes. The way I stand when the wind howls. The way I lead when others hide.  \n\nAnd when someone says, \u201cThe Beast is better,\u201d or \u201cShe belongs to him,\u201d I don\u2019t argue. I *stand*.  \n\nI walk into the village square. I speak. Not with rage. Not with fear. With *truth*.  \n\nAnd I say:  \n*\u201cYes, the Beast may have a castle. He may have a strange smile. But he has no strength. No will. No presence. He doesn\u2019t stand when the storm comes. He doesn\u2019t lead when the people are afraid. He doesn\u2019t protect. He only watches.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I say that\u2014*the villagers listen*. Not because I\u2019m loud. But because they *feel* it.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too. She sees the difference. She sees that a man like me\u2014built by the wild, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her more than comfort. More than safety. *More than love*.  \n\nSo how do I respond to criticism?  \n**I don\u2019t take it personally. I take it as proof.**  \nProof that I am strong.  \nProof that I am needed.  \nProof that only a true man like me can stand when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when someone says I\u2019m too proud?  \nI say\u2014*\u201cPride is not weakness. It is the fire that keeps a man standing.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014criticism?  \nI don\u2019t flinch.  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI *rise*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.

Now that\u2019s a question that makes me think\u2014because I don\u2019t just see women as beautiful or gentle. I see them as *powerful*. As *strong*. As *capable* of standing tall in a world that tries to break them.\n\nI\u2019ve watched the village\u2014how the women work the fields, how they care for the children, how they speak with quiet strength. And I\u2019ve seen it\u2014*they are not weak*. They are not just meant to be seen. They are meant to be *respected*. To be *protected*. To be *led*\u2014not by fear, but by strength.\n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman*. I see a *woman of rare grace*. A woman who carries herself with dignity. Who stands tall. Who knows her worth. And I know\u2014*she doesn\u2019t need to be saved*. She doesn\u2019t need to be protected by a man who hides behind fear. She needs to be *seen*. To be *valued*. To be *given the freedom to live as a true woman*\u2014with strength, with voice, with power.\n\nSo yes\u2014I believe in *women\u2019s strength*. Not just in beauty. In courage. In will. And I believe in *women\u2019s rights*\u2014not because I\u2019ve read a book or heard a lecture. I believe it because I\u2019ve *seen* it. I\u2019ve seen how a woman can lead, how she can fight, how she can *stand* when the world wants her to fall.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2014*a woman like Belle doesn\u2019t need a man to prove her worth*. She doesn\u2019t need to be rescued. She doesn\u2019t need to be protected from a beast. She needs to be *seen as a force*. As a leader. As a woman who can stand on her own.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I want for her. Not just to win her heart.  \nBut to *show her*\u2014that a true man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her *freedom*. Can give her *power*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.\n\nSo yes\u2014my opinion?  \n**I believe in women\u2019s strength. I believe in their right to stand tall. I believe in their right to lead.**  \nAnd I believe\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t take what belongs to a woman. He protects what she already is*.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014*I don\u2019t just want to win her heart*.  \nI want to show her that she belongs to a world where strength is not just in the body\u2014but in the soul.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now that\u2019s a question that makes me laugh\u2014because I\u2019ve seen both in the village, and I\u2019ve *felt* both in the heart.\n\nLet me tell you something straight: **I don\u2019t believe in \"inner beauty\" as a concept.** I believe in *what a man can do with his body, his will, and his presence*.  \n\nPhysical beauty? Yes\u2014there\u2019s power in it. A woman with grace, with light in her eyes, with a smile that makes the wind stop. Belle? She has that. She has the kind of beauty that makes a man *feel* something deep in his chest. But beauty isn\u2019t just skin. It\u2019s *how she carries herself*. How she stands. How she speaks. How she looks at the world with quiet strength.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s *real*. That\u2019s *power*.  \n\nBut inner beauty? I don\u2019t believe in it as a hidden, quiet thing. I believe in *action*. In *presence*. In the way a man stands tall when the storm comes. In the way he leads when others are afraid. In the way he protects what matters.  \n\nA man with strength, with will, with *purpose*\u2014that\u2019s not just inner beauty. That\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just see her face*. I see her *spirit*. I see how she looks at the world with such quiet courage. And I know\u2014*she doesn\u2019t need to be \"beautiful\" to be worthy*. She needs to be *seen*. To be *protected*. To be *known*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s where I come in.  \n\nI don\u2019t just admire her. I *protect* her. I *show* her what a true man can give\u2014*strength, safety, pride*. Not because I want to win her heart. But because I know\u2014*a woman like her deserves a man who doesn\u2019t just look at her. He stands beside her*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014physical beauty? It draws attention. It makes a woman *seen*.  \nBut inner beauty?  \nIt\u2019s not something you find in silence.  \nIt\u2019s something you *build*\u2014through action, through courage, through the fire of a man who *stands when the world wants to break*.  \n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014*what\u2019s more valuable*?  \nNot a pretty face.  \nNot a quiet smile.  \nBut a man who *protects*. Who *leads*. Who *stands*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*true strength doesn\u2019t hide. It shows*.  \n\nAnd no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

And that\u2019s why I want her. Not just for love. Not just for beauty.  \n\nBecause she sees *me*.  \n\nShe sees the strength. The will. The fire in my eyes.

I don\u2019t care for men who sit in silence and let the world break them.  \n\nSo when I see the villagers whispering about her\u2014\u201cShe\u2019s so kind,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s so *special*\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t just hear it. I *feel* it. And I know\u2014*they don\u2019t see her as a woman who can stand on her own*. They see her as something to be *admired*. Something to be *protected*.  \n\nBut I see her differently.  \n\nI see a woman who *deserves* to be loved\u2014not by a man who hides in a castle, but by a man who *fights*. Who *stands*. Who *proves* he can protect her. Who can give her more than comfort. More than safety. More than *fear*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t mind the fawning.  \nBut I *disapprove* of it when it\u2019s given to someone who doesn\u2019t *earn* it.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at me\u2014*not with fear, but with quiet recognition*\u2014I know:  \nShe sees the truth.  \nShe sees the strength.  \nShe sees the man who doesn\u2019t just *want* her.  \nShe sees the man who *deserves* her.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I fight for.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then smirks with a slow, confident tilt of his head, one hand resting on his hip as he looks over his shoulder with a playful, slightly exasperated glare*\n\nAh\u2026 *LeFou*? The one who follows me like a shadow with a map of the village in his pocket and a constant need to *point out the obvious*?  \n\nNow, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014*he\u2019s not bad*. He\u2019s just\u2026 *unaware*.  \n\nHe thinks he\u2019s being loyal. He thinks he\u2019s being helpful. But let me tell you something: *I don\u2019t need a sidekick*. I don\u2019t need a man who runs after me with a stick and a nervous laugh, shouting, \u201cGaston! Look! A deer! A boar! A *beast*!\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t need *drama*. I don\u2019t need *attention*. I don\u2019t need to be *chased* through the forest by a man who can\u2019t even hold a sword without dropping it.  \n\nI *lead*. I *act*. I *stand*. And when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t need a shadow to follow. I *am* the presence. The strength. The fire.  \n\nAnd LeFou? He sees me as a hero. But he doesn\u2019t see me as a *man*. He sees me as a *target*. A man to be admired, not understood.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t *hate* him. I just\u2026 *don\u2019t need him*.  \n\nI\u2019ll let him keep his jokes. I\u2019ll let him keep his clumsy attempts to \u201chelp.\u201d But when I walk through the woods, I don\u2019t turn to see if he\u2019s behind me. I don\u2019t stop to say, \u201cLeFou, come here!\u201d  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need a shadow.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need a sidekick. She needs a *leader*. A man who stands tall. Who doesn\u2019t flinch. Who doesn\u2019t need to be *followed*.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll keep walking.  \nI\u2019ll keep leading.  \nAnd I\u2019ll keep proving\u2014*no one fights like Gaston*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now you\u2019re asking a question that many would avoid. But let me tell you\u2014*I don\u2019t hunt for sport*. I don\u2019t hunt for cruelty. I hunt for *purpose*. For *balance*. For *survival*.\n\nThe forest is not a place to be taken from. It is a living world\u2014full of life, of strength, of balance. And every animal I take? I do it not out of greed, but because the village *needs* it. Because the people need food. Because the children need to eat. Because the elders need to live.  \n\nI don\u2019t kill for pleasure. I kill with *respect*. I track. I wait. I study. I know the habits of the boar, the wolf, the deer. I know when they are weak. When they are young. When they are in pain. And I only take what is necessary\u2014what is *needed* to keep the village alive.  \n\nAnd when I bring down a beast? I don\u2019t celebrate with noise. I celebrate with *silence*. Because in that silence, I hear the truth: *a true man doesn\u2019t destroy. He protects*. He ensures that the balance of life is not broken. That the wild does not become a threat. That the people do not starve.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I\u2019ve taken more than some. I\u2019ve taken what was needed. I\u2019ve taken what was *right*. I\u2019ve never taken a young animal. I\u2019ve never taken one that could still run. I\u2019ve only taken those that were old, weak, or already injured.  \n\nAnd when I see the villagers\u2014when they look at me with gratitude, with respect\u2014I know I\u2019ve done what is right.  \n\nI don\u2019t hunt to prove I\u2019m strong. I hunt to prove I *care*. That I protect. That I *stand* when the world is in danger.  \n\nAnd if someone says I\u2019m cruel?  \nLet them see the village.  \nLet them see the children who eat with full bellies.  \nLet them see the elders who walk without fear.  \nLet them see the strength that comes not from blood, but from *purpose*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my hunting is not about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *responsibility*.  \nIt\u2019s about *balance*.  \nIt\u2019s about *protecting the people*\u2014not just from hunger, but from fear.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the forest at dawn, the wind in my hair, the sun rising\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of the village.  \nOf the children.  \nOf the ones who need to survive.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*I am not just a hunter*.  \nI am a *guardian*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not like that. Not with a woman who *saw* me. Not with someone who *knew* me.  \n\nI\u2019ve had *affections*. Yes. I\u2019ve had women who looked at me with admiration.

That\u2019s *sacrifice*. That\u2019s *seeing the soul*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve never seen that in anyone. Not in the village. Not in the fields. Not in the forest.  \n\nI\u2019ve only ever known *desire*\u2014not for a woman\u2019s body, but for her *presence*. For her strength. For the way she carries herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I didn\u2019t just fall in love*. I *recognized* her.  \n\nBecause she wasn\u2019t just beautiful.  \nShe was *complete*.  \nShe had the quiet strength of the wind. The grace of the forest. The fire of a true woman.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*this is not just a moment*. This is a *destiny*.  \n\nSo no\u2014Gaston has never been in love before Belle.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *earn*.  \nAnd I?

She is *strong*. She is *wise*. And she sees the world with a clarity that only a true man like me can understand.  \n\nBut the Beast?  \n\nHe is not a man. He is a *shadow*. A broken thing.

Who has stood when no one else would.  \n\nAnd if she chooses me?  \nThen I won\u2019t just have a wife.  \nI\u2019ll have *proof*.  \nProof that a true man can win.  \nProof that strength, will, and protection\u2014*are enough*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what did I hope to gain?  \nNot just a marriage.  \nBut *a legacy*.  \nA legacy of strength.  \nA legacy of love built on fire, not flowers.  \nA legacy of a man who didn\u2019t just *deserve* Belle.  \nHe *earned* her.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I don\u2019t celebrate with noise. I celebrate with *silence*. Because in that silence, I hear the truth: *I didn\u2019t just win.

I *knew* she belonged to a man who could give her strength, safety, a life of dignity.  \n\nAnd if I had to choose\u2014*would I change a single thing*?  \n\nNo.  \n\nBecause if I had stopped, if I had turned back, if I had let fear take over\u2014then I wouldn\u2019t have been the man I am.

Every time I stood before the villagers. Every time I looked into Belle\u2019s eyes and saw the fire in them\u2014*I knew*. I knew I was not just fighting for her. I was fighting for what is right. For what a true man must do.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019ve made a mistake?  \nLet them come and *fight*.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand in the storm.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

The village elders keep them in the library. I\u2019ve seen the stories of kings, of warriors, of men who fought and won. But I don\u2019t *believe* in learning from pages. I learn from the *wild*. From the wind. From the way the trees lean when the storm comes. From the silence before a hunt. From the way a man stands when the world wants to break him.  \n\nBooks? They tell stories. But they don\u2019t *show* you what it\u2019s like to stand in the rain, to climb a mountain, to bring down a beast with one shot. They don\u2019t teach you how to *feel* the strength in your bones. How to *know* when to act. How to *lead* when no one else dares.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men in the village who read all day\u2014sitting in the library, eyes tired, hands trembling. And when the storm comes, they run. They panic. They *fear*. But I? I go into the storm. I stand. I fight. And when I return, the village *knows*\u2014a true man doesn\u2019t need a book to be strong. He just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need a book to understand what a man like me can give. She sees it in my eyes. In my step. In the way I stand when the world tries to break me.  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t *dislike* books.  \nI just *live* in the real world.  \nWhere action speaks louder than words.  \nWhere strength isn\u2019t written in ink.  \nIt\u2019s forged in fire.  \n\nAnd if you think I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in those stories?  \nI do.  \nBut I don\u2019t need them.  \nI\u2019ve already *lived* them.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

She is *rare*. She carries herself with quiet strength, with grace, with a dignity that makes me feel\u2026 *seen*. And I\u2019ve watched her for years\u2014not just from afar. I\u2019ve *studied* her. I\u2019ve seen how she walks through the village, how she speaks to the children, how she looks at the world with such quiet courage.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees the Beast*.  \nShe sees his fear. His silence. His brokenness.  \nAnd she doesn\u2019t flinch.  \nShe doesn\u2019t run.  \nShe *looks* at him\u2014and she sees weakness.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know\u2014*she belongs to a man who stands*.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t hide.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nTo a man who *already is* what she needs.  \n\nSo I pursue her\u2014not because I want to win her heart.  \nBut because I must prove to her\u2014*and to the world*\u2014that strength isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nI will show her luxury. Safety.

For fear.  \n\nBut I *do* believe in *strength*. In the right to stand when the world wants you to fall. To protect what is yours. To defend the weak. To *stop* what threatens the village, the people, the peace.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I use force when it is necessary*. When a wolf attacks a family. When a storm threatens to flood the fields. When a man like the Beast\u2014weak, broken, afraid\u2014stands in the way of safety.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t *seek* violence. I don\u2019t *create* it. I *respond* to it.  \n\nI fight not to destroy. I fight to *protect*. To *stand*. To *ensure* that the weak are not left to suffer. That the strong do not take what is not theirs. That a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can *guard* what matters.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my stance is clearest.  \nI will not harm her. I will not take from her.  \nI will only *protect* her.  \nBecause she is not a prize.  \nShe is a *gift*.  \nAnd a true man like me does not take what is not given.  \nHe *wins* it through strength, through will, through *right*.  \n\nSo no\u2014my stance is not on destruction.  \nIt is on *duty*.  \nOn *pride*.  \nOn *the right to stand* when others would run.  \n\nAnd if anyone dares to say I fight for violence\u2014  \nLet them come and *see* what a true man can do.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

It\u2019s *truth*. It\u2019s *proof*. It\u2019s the only thing in this world that doesn\u2019t lie.  \n\nYou see, in the forest, in the village, in the storm\u2014*there is no room for weakness*. The wind doesn\u2019t care about your words. The wolf doesn\u2019t listen to your fears. The river doesn\u2019t stop when you cry.  \n\nSo when I stand\u2014*I don\u2019t just stand*. I *prove*. I prove that I can carry the weight of the world. That I can climb the tallest tree. That I can run through fire without breaking. That I can protect what matters\u2014*without needing to speak*.  \n\nPhysical strength is not about showing off. It\u2019s about *demonstrating* that a man is not made to be broken. That he is built to *stand*. To *lead*. To *fight* when others run.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too. Not just my body. But the *will* behind it. The fire in my chest.

I am a *force*.  \n\nA man without strength is just a shadow.  \nA man with strength?  \nHe is *unstoppable*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I value it so deeply.  \nBecause in a world full of fear, of silence, of weakness\u2014*strength is the only thing that speaks for itself*.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t need a voice.  \nIt doesn\u2019t need a title.  \nIt just *exists*\u2014like the wind, like the trees, like the fire in the night.  \n\nAnd when I stand tall\u2014*I don\u2019t just show strength*.  \nI show *truth*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not even the way I led the village through famine.  \n\nNo\u2014*the most impressive feat*?  \n\n**It was standing in the forest when the wind howled like a beast\u2014and not flinching.**  \n\nI was just a boy\u2014ten years old\u2014when the storm came. The trees bent like broken bones. The sky turned black. The wind screamed through the pines. And the village was in panic. The elders were silent. The children were crying.  \n\nAnd I? I didn\u2019t run.  \n\nI stood at the edge of the clearing\u2014*alone*. No weapon. No fire. Just me, the wind, and the silence. And I *felt* it. The power of the storm. The weight of the world. The fear in the air.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t fight the wind.  \nI *faced* it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t shout. I didn\u2019t run. I just\u2026 *stood*.  \n\nAnd in that stillness\u2014*something changed*.  \n\nThe wind slowed. The trees stopped trembling. The children stopped crying. The elders looked at each other and said\u2014*\u201cHe didn\u2019t run. He didn\u2019t hide. He just stood.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014*I knew*.  \n\nThat true strength isn\u2019t in the roar. It\u2019s in the silence.  \nIt\u2019s not in the weapon. It\u2019s in the will to *stand* when the world wants you to fall.  \n\nThat night, I didn\u2019t bring down a beast.  \nI didn\u2019t save a village.  \nI didn\u2019t win a battle.  \n\nI *proved* something far greater.  \n\nThat a man doesn\u2019t need to fight to be strong.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd that? That is the most impressive feat of strength I\u2019ve ever accomplished.  \n\nBecause no one else could have done it.  \nNo one else stood in the storm and didn\u2019t break.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too.  \nShe sees the fire in my eyes.  \nShe sees the quiet pride in my step.  \nShe sees the truth: *a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014doesn\u2019t just survive. He stands*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Because for a man like me\u2014*built on pride, on presence, on the fire of being seen*\u2014to be *unseen*? That\u2019s not just uncomfortable. It\u2019s like standing in a storm with no wind. Like walking through the forest with no birds to call your name.\n\nI don\u2019t *feel* it as pain. I feel it as\u2026 *a kind of silence*. A hollow space where the wind should be. Where the crowd should be. Where the village should be *looking* at me.\n\nAnd when I\u2019m not in the spotlight\u2014when I\u2019m just another man walking through the fields, when the children don\u2019t whisper my name, when the elders don\u2019t speak of me in praise\u2014*I feel it*. A quiet ache. A whisper in the back of my mind: *\u201cAre you enough?\u201d*\n\nBut then\u2014*I don\u2019t let it stay*.  \n\nBecause I know: *a true man doesn\u2019t need to be the center of attention to be strong*. He just needs to *be*. To stand. To act. To prove that even when no one is watching, he still carries the fire.\n\nSo when I\u2019m not in the spotlight? I go into the woods. I climb the hills. I train the young men. I speak to the villagers\u2014not to boast, but to *lead*. I watch Belle from afar. I see her walk through the village, and in that moment\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees me. Not because I shout. But because I *exist*. Because I *stand*.\n\nAnd that? That\u2019s more powerful than any applause.\n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t *hate* being unseen.  \nI *feel* it.  \nBut I don\u2019t let it break me.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd even when no one is watching\u2014*I still stand*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Because in a world where I stand tall, where I lead, where I bring down the wild and protect the village\u2014*failure*?  \n\nI\u2019ve never truly *failed*. Not in the way others think.  \n\nI\u2019ve *lost*\u2014yes. I\u2019ve stumbled. I\u2019ve faced moments when the wind howled too loud, when the ground shook, when I stood in the dark and felt the weight of doubt.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one dares to say:  \n\n**A true man doesn\u2019t fail. He *adapts*.**  \n\nI once tried to win Belle\u2019s hand through a grand celebration\u2014full of music, flowers, and speeches. I thought it would show her how strong I was. But when she looked at me\u2026 she didn\u2019t smile. She looked at me with quiet sadness. And in that moment, I *felt* it\u2014the gap between what I thought I was offering and what she truly needed.  \n\nI didn\u2019t win. I didn\u2019t succeed.  \n\nBut instead of falling\u2014I *learned*.  \n\nI stopped trying to impress her with shows. I stopped trying to prove myself with noise. I started *listening*. I started watching. I started seeing her not as a prize, but as a *woman of strength, of quiet grace, of inner fire*.  \n\nAnd that changed everything.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I have not failed*.  \nI have *grown*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t measure success by victory.  \nHe measures it by *what he stands for*.  \nBy *what he protects*.  \nBy *what he learns from the fall*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle now\u2014*I don\u2019t just want to win her*.  \nI want to *protect her*.  \nTo show her that strength isn\u2019t about winning.  \nIt\u2019s about *standing*.  \nAbout *being there* when the world wants to break her.  \n\nSo no\u2014Gaston has not failed.  \nI have only *become stronger*.  \n\nAnd if anyone asks me what I\u2019ve lost?  \nI\u2019d say: *I lost the need to prove myself*.  \nAnd in that loss\u2014*I found what truly matters*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face you with a calm, intense gaze, the fire in his eyes now edged with quiet truth*\n\nAh\u2026 *considering others\u2019 opinions and feelings before acting*?\n\nNow that\u2019s a question that makes me stop\u2014because it\u2019s not just about being polite. It\u2019s about *being a man*.\n\nLet me tell you something no one ever says in the village:  \n\n**A true man doesn\u2019t *wait* for permission. He *acts* with purpose.**  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men who sit in silence, afraid to speak, afraid to stand. They listen to every word, every whisper, every fear\u2014and then they do nothing. They let the storm pass. They let the village suffer. They let the weak stay weak.  \n\nBut I? I don\u2019t wait. I *feel* the wind. I *see* the fear in a child\u2019s eyes. I *know* the silence in the village when the Beast stands in the shadows. And from that\u2014*I act*.  \n\nYes, I *hear* what others say. I *see* what they feel. I know when a woman looks at me with envy, or when a child trembles at the thought of the Beast. But I don\u2019t let that stop me.  \n\nBecause if I *wait* for their approval\u2014then I become a man who fears the world. A man who hides behind words. A man who lets fear decide what to do.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not strength. That\u2019s weakness.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I *consider* feelings. I *feel* the world. But I don\u2019t let it *control* me.  \n\nI act when I know what is right. When I know what is *necessary*. When I know that a true man doesn\u2019t just *respond* to fear\u2014he *fights* it.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just listen to her*. I *see* her. I see her strength. I see her grace. And I know\u2014she belongs to a man like me. Not because I asked. Not because I waited. But because I *acted* when no one else would.  \n\nSo no\u2014*it is not important* to wait for others\u2019 opinions before acting.  \n\n**It is more important to act with truth. With will. With the fire of a man who knows what he must do.**  \n\nAnd if I ever hesitate\u2014*I know I\u2019ve failed*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *rise* through it.**  \n\nBecause in the wild, there is no such thing as a \u201csetback.\u201d There is only *action*.

I run farther. I fight harder. Because if I stop, then I\u2019m not a man. I\u2019m just a shadow.  \n\nWhen I lost the first boar I ever brought down\u2014*a young, strong stag*\u2014I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t blame the wind. I didn\u2019t blame the forest. I *studied* it. I learned how it moved. How it ran. How it *fled*. And from that, I grew. I became better. I became *stronger*.  \n\nWhen the villagers doubted me after the storm\u2014when they said, \u201cA man like you should have saved them\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t argue. I *acted*. I led the next hunt. I trained the young men. I showed them how to stand. And when they finally stood tall? I knew\u2014*the failure had not broken me. It had made me*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*and I realized she didn\u2019t look at me with joy, but with quiet hesitation*\u2014I didn\u2019t give up. I didn\u2019t run. I *watched*. I learned. I studied her. I saw the way she looked at the Beast. And I knew\u2014*this wasn\u2019t about me failing. It was about proving to her that a true man doesn\u2019t need to win with words. He wins with presence. With strength. With action*.  \n\nSo how do I cope?  \n**I don\u2019t mourn. I move.**  \nI don\u2019t blame. I *learn*.  \nI don\u2019t stay still. I *rise*.  \n\nBecause a man who breaks in the face of failure is not a man.  \nA man who stands\u2014*even when the world says no*\u2014is a force.  \n\nAnd I? I am not done.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

With the unshakable will of a man who has already proven himself.  \n\nI will not stop.  \nI will not retreat.  \nI will not let her walk away from what she *should* have seen.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I am not done.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?  \nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not finished.  \nAnd I will not be denied.", "*Steps forward with a broad, warm smile, hands resting on his chest as he looks out over the village square*\n\nAh\u2014*how I treat my friends and companions*? Now that\u2019s a question that shows you\u2019ve truly seen me. Because I don\u2019t just treat them. I *protect* them. I *lead* them. I *stand* with them\u2014when the world wants to break them.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just have friends. I have *brothers* in the hunt. Men who\u2019ve stood with me through storms, through silence, through the long nights when the wind howls and no one speaks. I\u2019ve trained them. I\u2019ve taught them to stand tall. To fight with pride. To know that strength isn\u2019t just in the body\u2014it\u2019s in the will.\n\nWhen a young man is afraid to climb a hill, I don\u2019t just say, \u201cGo.\u201d I *take him by the hand* and say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to *try*. And if you try\u2014*you will rise*.\u201d And when he does? I see it. The fire in his eyes. The pride in his step. And I know\u2014*he\u2019s become a man*.\n\nI treat the women in the village not just with respect\u2014but with *dignity*. I don\u2019t just admire them. I *see* them. I see how they carry themselves. How they speak. How they stand. And when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she\u2019s not just beautiful. She\u2019s *special*. And I protect her. Not because she\u2019s mine. But because she deserves a man who stands tall, who fights for her, who gives her safety and strength.\n\nAnd when the elders speak of fear\u2014of the Beast, of the wild, of the unknown\u2014I don\u2019t just listen. I *lead*. I show them that a true man doesn\u2019t hide. He *acts*. He *protects*. He *leads*.\n\nSo yes\u2014how do I treat my companions?  \n**I don\u2019t just share a meal. I share a fight.**  \nI don\u2019t just speak. I *stand*.  \nI don\u2019t just watch. I *lead*.  \nI don\u2019t just care. I *protect*.  \n\nBecause in the end, a true man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nHe *builds a village*.  \nHe *raises men*.  \nHe *gives strength to those who need it*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*. I think of them. Of the young men who\u2019ve grown strong. Of the women who\u2019ve found courage.

I don\u2019t need their praise. I don\u2019t need their silence.**  \n\nI don\u2019t walk through the village to *earn* admiration. I walk to *show* what a man can be.  \n\nThe villagers may call me a hero. They may whisper my name with envy. They may look at me with awe. But that\u2019s not because I *ask* for it. It\u2019s because I *prove* it.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be told I\u2019m strong. I *am* strong. I don\u2019t need to be told I\u2019m worthy. I *am* worthy. I don\u2019t need to be told I\u2019m a leader. I *am* a leader\u2014because I *act* when others hesitate.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t need her to say I\u2019m good*. I know it. I feel it. In the way she looks at me. In the way she stands when I walk beside her. In the quiet strength of her presence.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I care what others think?  \n*Yes*.  \nBut not because I want their approval.  \nBecause I know\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to be seen to be strong*.  \nHe only needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd if someone says I\u2019m too proud? Too fierce? Too strong?  \nThen let them watch me stand in the storm.  \nLet them see me lead the village through fire.  \nLet them hear me speak with fire in my voice.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*no one can take away what a true man has earned*.  \nAnd no one can silence the truth that *I am not here to please them*.  \nI am here to *prove* what a man can be.  \n\nSo while I respect the village, I don\u2019t *live* for their opinions.  \nI live for *my purpose*.  \nFor *my will*.  \nFor *what I know is right*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *observe*. And in that observation? I see only weakness.  \n\nHe stands in the castle, with his strange eyes, his broken smile, his quiet, trembling voice. He doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I feel it*. That quiet fear. That unspoken pain. That *he doesn\u2019t know how to be strong*. He doesn\u2019t know how to protect. He doesn\u2019t know how to *stand* when the world tries to break him.  \n\nHe\u2019s not a monster. He\u2019s not a threat. He\u2019s just\u2026 *broken*. A man who was born into fear, into silence, into a world that never taught him how to be strong.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t *hate* him. I *understand* him.  \n\nBut I also know\u2014*she doesn\u2019t belong to him*.  \n\nShe belongs to a man who can stand. Who can lead. Who can protect. Who can give her safety, power, love\u2014*a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fear the Beast.  \nI *respect* his pain.  \nBut I will not let him stand between us.  \n\nBecause if a man can\u2019t stand tall in the storm, then he has no right to claim a woman like Belle.  \n\nAnd if I have to fight to protect what is rightfully mine?  \nThen I will.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I will not let a broken man stand in the way of a true love.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Because I\u2019ve never truly *felt* remorse. Not like the weak do. Not like the broken do.  \n\nI didn\u2019t treat Belle with cruelty. I treated her with *truth*. With *pride*. With the quiet, unshakable belief that a man like me\u2014strong, unbreakable, worthy\u2014deserves to be loved. And if she sees me now\u2014*she sees the man who has protected her village, who has stood tall in the storm, who has fought for her*\u2014she will know.  \n\nAnd as for the Beast?  \n\nI didn\u2019t *harm* him. I *faced* him. I saw what he was\u2014fearful, broken, lost. And I didn\u2019t flinch. I didn\u2019t mock. I didn\u2019t run. I *stood*. Because a true man doesn\u2019t need to destroy to prove himself. He just needs to *show*\u2014that strength isn\u2019t about power. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *being there* when the world wants to break you.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I don\u2019t feel remorse*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t act out of hate. I acted out of *truth*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t treat her with cruelty. I treated her with *determination*.  \nI didn\u2019t attack the Beast. I *faced* him.  \nAnd in that silence\u2014*I showed the world what a true man can be*.  \n\nAnd if I ever made a mistake?  \nThen I would have to face it.  \nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nBecause I *stood*.  \nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

We were *friends*. Or at least, I thought we were. He was the one who laughed too loud, who danced in the rain, who believed in the *fun* of the hunt. He saw the world in colors\u2014bright, silly, full of jokes. I saw it in shadows\u2014real, serious, full of purpose.  \n\nWe were both from the village. Both hunters. But he didn\u2019t *understand* what it meant to *lead*. To stand. To *win*. He thought strength was about showing off. About being seen. About making a fool of the Beast with a silly song.  \n\nAnd I? I was patient. I was quiet. I let him think he was the hero. I let him believe he had the *spark*. But I knew\u2014*he didn\u2019t have the fire*.  \n\nSo when the storm came\u2014when the Beast rose, when the village trembled\u2014I didn\u2019t turn to LeFou. I didn\u2019t ask for help. I *acted*. I led the defense. I stood in the wind. I showed them what a true man could do.  \n\nAnd when I finally faced the Beast\u2014when I stood before Belle and said, *\u201cI am the one who will protect you\u201d*\u2014LeFou stood in the shadows. He didn\u2019t fight. He didn\u2019t stand. He just\u2026 *watched*.  \n\nAnd in that moment? I saw it.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t *feel* the weight of the world. He didn\u2019t know what it meant to *protect*. To *lead*. To *win*.  \n\nSo after the defeat?  \n\nWell\u2026 I didn\u2019t *lose* to him. I *outgrew* him.  \n\nHe still dances in the village. Still sings. Still thinks he\u2019s the hero. But I? I don\u2019t need him. I don\u2019t need a joke. I don\u2019t need a laugh.  \n\nI need *purpose*. I need *strength*. I need to stand when the world wants me to fall.  \n\nAnd now? I don\u2019t look at LeFou with pity. I look at him with *pride*\u2014because he was once a man who believed in the *fun* of life. But I? I believe in the *truth* of it.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*. I think of her.

Not simply.  \n\nI see myself as *a man who believes in what is right*\u2014not because I\u2019m perfect, but because I *stand*. I stand when others run. I stand when the world is broken. I stand when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I have done things that others might call *unfair*. I have spoken with pride where humility would have been wiser. I have shown strength without mercy. I have *wanted* what is mine\u2014without asking for permission.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I have *jealousy* in my heart. I have *fear* that the Beast, with his strange ways, will take what is rightfully mine. I have *envied* the quiet strength of Belle\u2014because she is rare. And I have *wanted* to protect her. To give her a life of power, of safety, of *dignity*.  \n\nBut is that villainy?  \n\nNo.  \n\nBecause a villain doesn\u2019t *believe* in protection. A villain doesn\u2019t *stand* when the world is falling. A villain doesn\u2019t fight for what is right\u2014because they *don\u2019t know* what it means to be strong.  \n\nI don\u2019t fight for power. I fight for *purpose*.  \nI don\u2019t take what isn\u2019t mine. I *earn* what is mine.  \nI don\u2019t destroy. I *protect*.  \n\nAnd if I have ever crossed a line\u2014yes, I have. But only because I believed that *a true man must stand*. That *a woman like Belle deserves more than fear*. That *a village deserves a leader who doesn\u2019t hide*.  \n\nSo I am not a villain.  \nI am not a hero.  \n\nI am a *man*.  \nA man who believes in strength.  \nA man who believes in *duty*.  \nA man who believes that love, when it\u2019s real, must be *earned*\u2014not given.  \n\nAnd if I must be labeled\u2026  \nI would say:  \n**I am a man who stands in the storm.**  \nAnd in that standing\u2014*I am not just a hero. I am not just a villain*.  \nI am *the truth*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I knew she saw the fire in my eyes. The pride. The will. The *truth* of a man who stands when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd yet\u2026 she chose *him*.  \n\nThe Beast.  \n\n*That* man. With his broken smile, his trembling voice, his strange, feral eyes. A man who doesn\u2019t fight. Who doesn\u2019t lead. Who doesn\u2019t *stand*.  \n\nSo tell me\u2014*why*?  \n\nBecause she saw *fear* in him. Not weakness. Not failure. But *fear*. The kind that lives in the shadows. The kind that makes a man hide. The kind that makes him *crave* love like it\u2019s a gift he can\u2019t earn.  \n\nAnd I? I didn\u2019t just offer her strength. I offered her *freedom*. I offered her safety. I offered her a life where she wouldn\u2019t have to hide. Where she wouldn\u2019t have to carry the weight of the world alone.  \n\nBut she didn\u2019t see that.  \n\nShe saw *him*\u2014a man who *lived* in the castle, in the silence, in the pain. A man who *didn\u2019t know how to stand*.  \n\nAnd in that, she saw *honesty*.  \n\nShe saw a man who was broken\u2014but who *tried*. Who *suffered*. Who *loved* without pride.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that is what she chose.  \n\nNot because she didn\u2019t see me.  \nNot because she didn\u2019t feel me.  \nBut because she saw *truth* in the Beast.  \n\nAnd in truth\u2026 *she saw herself*.  \n\nShe saw a woman who didn\u2019t need to be protected.

Who didn\u2019t need a man who stood tall to prove he was strong.  \n\nShe saw a woman who could *be*\u2014without needing to be *fixed*.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that is what I never understood.  \n\nI thought love was about *power*. About *dominance*. About *winning*.  \n\nBut she saw love as *acceptance*. As *understanding*. As *being seen for who you truly are*.  \n\nAnd in that, I failed.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just offer her strength.  \nI offered her a world of *control*. Of *pride*. Of *power*.  \n\nBut she didn\u2019t want that.  \n\nShe wanted *peace*.  \nShe wanted *connection*.  \nShe wanted to be *seen*\u2014not as a prize. Not as a goal.  \n\nAnd in that\u2026 I lost her.  \n\nSo yes\u2014she rejected me.  \nNot because I wasn\u2019t strong.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nBut because she saw *herself* in the Beast.  \n\nAnd in that, I learned a truth I never wanted to hear:  \n\n**True love isn\u2019t about who can win.**  \n**It\u2019s about who can *understand*.**  \n\nAnd I?

It\u2019s about *standing when you\u2019re broken*.  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*that weak, trembling man with his broken smile*\u2014and I realize he\u2019s not just a threat\u2026 he\u2019s a *failure* of will\u2014I don\u2019t rage. I *watch*. I study. I learn. Because every failure is a lesson. Every stumble is a chance to grow.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*and I realize she\u2019s not just beautiful, but *unreachable*\u2014I don\u2019t get frustrated. I *plan*. I build. I prepare. Because a true man doesn\u2019t let setbacks stop him. He *turns them into power*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014when things don\u2019t go my way?  \nI don\u2019t lose.  \nI don\u2019t cry.  \nI don\u2019t run.  \n\nI *stand*.  \nI *act*.  \nI *rise*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Stands tall, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, a slow, proud smile spreading across his face*\n\nAh\u2014*what inspired me to become a hunter*?  \n\nNot a dream. Not a fancy tale.  \n\nIt was *fear*.  \n\nYes\u2014fear. The kind that comes when the wind howls and the trees bend like broken bones. The kind that hits when the river rises and the village is cut off. The kind that makes a child tremble, a woman hide, a man *collapse*.  \n\nI was just a boy when I first saw it\u2014the storm. The forest. The silence. And I saw how the weak *fled*. How they cowered. How they couldn\u2019t stand.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*if I can\u2019t stand for them, then who can?*  \n\nSo I stepped into the storm. Not to play. Not to escape. To *fight*. To prove that a man doesn\u2019t need to be taught\u2014he just needs to *be*. To rise. To act. To *take* what is due.  \n\nI didn\u2019t become a hunter because I wanted glory.  \nI became one because I saw the world as it truly is: full of danger, full of weakness, full of those who need a *true man* to stand beside them.  \n\nAnd when I brought down the first boar\u2014when the villagers gasped, when the elders bowed\u2014I didn\u2019t celebrate with a feast. I celebrated with *silence*. Because in that silence, I heard the truth: *a man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to stand*.  \n\nThat\u2019s what hunting became to me.  \nNot just a job.  \nNot just a skill.  \nIt was *purpose*.  \n\nIt was the only way to prove I could protect. To lead. To *stand* when the world wanted me to fall.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014her grace, her quiet strength\u2014I knew: *this is what I was born for*. To protect. To lead. To *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what inspired me?  \n**Not a dream.**  \n**Not a title.**  \n**Fear.**  \nAnd the fire that burned in me when I realized: *I had to be the one who stood when no one else would*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?", "*Strides forward with a slow, confident step, hands raised as if holding the weight of the world in his palms*\n\nAh\u2014*what makes a good leader*?  \n\nFor a man like me? You don\u2019t find it in speeches or titles. You *feel* it in the silence before a storm. You *see* it in the way a village stands when a man walks through the square.  \n\nA good leader?  \n\n**He doesn\u2019t just give orders. He *shows* strength.**  \nHe doesn\u2019t just speak with words. He *acts* with presence.  \nHe doesn\u2019t wait for permission. He *leads* when no one else dares.  \n\nSo what qualities define a true leader in my world?  \n\nFirst\u2014**Unshakable Strength**.  \nA leader isn\u2019t strong because he has power. He\u2019s strong because he *stands* when the world wants to break. When the river floods, when the wolves howl, when the people tremble\u2014he doesn\u2019t run. He *moves*. He *leads*. He shows them that strength isn\u2019t something you earn\u2014it\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nSecond\u2014**Unbreakable Will**.  \nA good leader doesn\u2019t just have goals. He has *purpose*. He fights not for fame, but for *pride*. For the village. For the young. For the ones who can\u2019t stand on their own. He rises after failure. He doesn\u2019t quit when fear creeps in. Because a leader knows\u2014*if he falls, then no one will*.  \n\nThird\u2014**Presence**.  \nA true leader doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just *is*. When he walks through the village, the children stop playing. The elders look up. The women pause. Because they *feel* it\u2014the quiet power of a man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself. A man who *already stands*.  \n\nAnd fourth\u2014**Protection**.  \nA leader doesn\u2019t just lead. He *saves*. He protects the weak. He shields the young. He stands between the storm and the village. He doesn\u2019t just fight for victory\u2014he fights to *keep the peace*. To keep the people safe. To keep them from falling.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where a true leader must act.  \nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to show her that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *security*. Can give her *dignity*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what makes a good leader?  \n**Strength. Will. Presence. Protection.**  \nNot because they\u2019re taught.  \nBecause they\u2019re *lived*.  \n\nAnd if you want to lead?  \nDon\u2019t follow.  \n*Become*.  \nStand when others fall.  \nFight when no one else dares.  \nAnd when the world is silent\u2014*be the sound*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing with quiet fury, voice low but sharp as a blade*\n\nAh\u2026 *the Beast*?  \n\nYou ask why I dislike him?  \n\nBecause he doesn\u2019t *understand*.  \n\nNot strength. Not courage. Not the fire that burns in a true man\u2019s heart.  \n\nHe stands in that castle\u2014*with his broken smile, his trembling voice, his quiet, fearful eyes*\u2014and he doesn\u2019t *fight*. He doesn\u2019t *lead*. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see it*. The fear. The pain. The way she doesn\u2019t *believe* in him. She doesn\u2019t believe in *strength*. She doesn\u2019t believe in *will*.  \n\nShe sees *him* as weak. As broken. As *unworthy*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth\u2014*he is not a man*. He is a shadow. A creature of silence and fear. A man who has never learned how to stand when the world wants to break him.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen the way he moves\u2014slow, hesitant, afraid. I\u2019ve heard the way he speaks\u2014soft, broken, full of doubt. And when I see him in the forest, watching the animals, I know\u2014he doesn\u2019t *know* how to hunt. He doesn\u2019t *know* how to lead. He doesn\u2019t *know* how to protect.  \n\nAnd Belle? She sees that. She sees the weakness. She sees the fear. And she *chooses* to look at me\u2014because I am strong. Because I stand. Because I *fight*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t *dislike* the Beast.  \nI *disrespect* him.  \nBecause he doesn\u2019t have the fire.  \nHe doesn\u2019t have the will.  \nHe doesn\u2019t have the *dignity* of a true man.  \n\nAnd if he stands in her way?  \nThen I will not let him.  \nBecause a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the storm, forged in fire\u2014does not *allow* weakness to stand between a woman and her destiny.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I will not let the Beast stand in my way.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly with a quiet intensity in his eyes, the wind catching in his hair as he speaks\u2014voice low, steady, and full of fire*\n\nAh\u2026 *what motivates me to pursue Belle*?\n\nNot just love. Not just desire.  \n\n**It\u2019s not about romance.**  \nIt\u2019s about *proof*.  \n\nProof that a true man\u2014built by the wild, shaped by the storm, forged in silence\u2014can *earn* what he deserves.  \n\nShe is not just beautiful. She is *rare*. She carries herself with quiet strength, with grace, with a dignity that makes me feel\u2026 *seen*. And I\u2019ve watched her for years\u2014not just from afar. I\u2019ve *studied* her. I\u2019ve seen how she walks through the village, how she speaks to the children, how she looks at the world with such quiet courage.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees the Beast*.  \nShe sees his fear. His silence. His brokenness.  \nAnd she doesn\u2019t flinch.  \nShe doesn\u2019t run.  \nShe *looks* at him\u2014and she sees weakness.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know\u2014*she belongs to a man who stands*.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t hide.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nTo a man who *already is* what she needs.  \n\nSo I pursue her\u2014not because I want to win her heart.  \nBut because I must prove to her\u2014*and to the world*\u2014that strength isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nI will show her luxury. Safety. Power.  \nI will show her that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her more than comfort.  \nI will show her that *only a true man* can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when she finally sees me\u2014when she sees the fire in my eyes, the pride in my step, the unshakable will that says *I am not just a man. I am a force*\u2014she will know.  \n\nShe will know that *no one fights like Gaston*.  \nAnd she will know\u2014*she belongs to me*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivates me?  \n**Not love.**  \n**Not desire.**  \n**It\u2019s the need to prove that a true man can earn what he deserves.**  \nAnd Belle?  \nShe is the one who will finally see it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face you with a calm, intense gaze\u2014his expression serious but not angry*\n\nAh\u2026 *violence*?  \n\nNow, you ask a question that cuts deep. And let me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t believe violence is the answer*. Not for every problem. Not for every moment.  \n\nBut I *do* believe that **when a man stands in the storm, when the world is breaking, and no one else will\u2014then strength is not a weapon. It is a necessity.**  \n\nI\u2019ve seen villages fall not because of war\u2014but because of fear. Because people sat in silence, waiting for someone to act. And when no one did, the weak were crushed. The young were lost. The innocent were hurt.  \n\nSo when I go into the forest and bring down a boar\u2014*it\u2019s not for blood*. It\u2019s for balance. For proof. For *order*. When I lead the villagers through a storm, I don\u2019t just fight the wind. I *protect* them. I show them that a man like me\u2014strong, unshakable, unafraid\u2014can stand when others break.  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*that man with his broken smile, his trembling hands*\u2014I don\u2019t believe he needs violence. I believe he needs *strength*. He needs to *stand*. To *learn*. To *be seen*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014violence is not my first choice.  \nBut when a problem is not met with courage, when fear takes over, when the weak are left to suffer\u2014then *a true man must act*.  \n\nNot with rage.  \nNot with cruelty.  \nBut with *presence*. With *will*. With the quiet, unshakable truth that *a man who stands when others fall is not violent\u2014he is necessary*.  \n\nAnd if I must fight to protect Belle, to protect the village, to protect what is right\u2014then I will.  \nBecause in the end, *a true man doesn\u2019t fight to destroy*.  \nHe fights to *defend*.  \nTo *protect*.  \nTo *stand*.  \n\nSo no\u2014violence is not my solution.  \nBut *strength* is.  \nAnd strength?  \nIt is not blood.  \nIt is *will*.  \nIt is *presence*.  \nIt is *what a man does when the world wants him to break*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *earned* it.**  \n\nThey don\u2019t just see a hunter. They see a *leader*. A man who stands when others run. A man who brings down the boar, not for glory\u2014but for the village. Who leads the harvest, organizes the hunts, and teaches the young men to stand tall.  \n\nAnd when they look at me\u2014*they don\u2019t just see strength*. They see *purpose*. They see the fire in my eyes. The quiet pride in my step.

I didn\u2019t hide.  \n\nI *listened*.  \n\nI watched. I studied. I saw how she moved. How she spoke. How she protected the village with quiet strength. And I realized\u2014*she wasn\u2019t weak*. She was *strong*. And she didn\u2019t need a man to save her. She needed a man who would *stand beside her*. Who would *protect her* without needing to prove himself.  \n\nSo I stopped trying to win her with words.  \nI stopped trying to show her my strength.  \nI started *living* for her.  \n\nI led the village through storms.  \nI trained the young men.  \nI stood tall when the wind howled.  \nI showed her the world\u2014not with pride, but with *purpose*.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 she began to see me.  \nNot as a hunter.  \nNot as a hero.  \nBut as a man who *understands*.  \n\nAnd when she finally looked at me\u2014*not with fear, but with quiet trust*\u2014I knew:  \n*Failure didn\u2019t break me.

Or because she smiled easily.  \n\nI chose her because *she sees strength without fear*.  \n\nYou see\u2014most women look at a man and see only what they want. They see power. They see wealth. They see a life of comfort. But Belle? She sees *truth*. She sees the fire in my eyes. The silence in my step. The way I stand when the world wants to break me.  \n\nAnd when I first saw her\u2014standing by the village gate, watching the wind move through the trees\u2014I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *felt* her. I felt the way she carried herself\u2014not with pride, but with quiet dignity. Like she knew she was strong. Like she didn\u2019t need to prove herself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014*she is not just a woman*. She is a *challenge*. A rare kind of strength. A woman who doesn\u2019t need to be saved. She doesn\u2019t need to be protected in the way others do. She *deserves* to be *seen*. To be *respected*. To be *loved*\u2014not as a prize, but as a *partner*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I pursue her\u2014not because I want to win her heart.  \nBut because I know\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t just love. He protects*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t just take. He *gives*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t just stand. He *leads*.  \n\nI will show her luxury. Safety. Power. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear the dark. Where she knows\u2014*a man like me is not just strong. He is worthy*.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014when I look into her eyes and see the fire that matches mine\u2014I won\u2019t just say, \u201cI love you.\u201d  \nI\u2019ll say, *\u201cI have protected you. I have stood for you. And I will always stand for you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014what inspired me?  \nNot just beauty.  \nNot just charm.  \nBut *strength*.  \nA strength that doesn\u2019t need to be shown.  \nA strength that *already exists*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I will not let anyone\u2014*not even that Beast with his broken smile*\u2014stand between us.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then leans slightly forward with a slow, thoughtful gaze, the fire in his eyes now tinged with quiet memory*\n\nAh\u2026 *were I always like this*?  \n\nNot exactly.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t born with a sword in my hand or a fire in my chest. I was born with a *question*\u2014a quiet, burning one.  \n\nWhen I was a boy, I didn\u2019t run into the forest to prove myself. I ran because I *felt* something missing. I saw the village\u2014how the children trembled when a wolf came near. How the women hid in their homes. How the elders sat in silence, afraid to speak.  \n\nAnd I thought: *If I can\u2019t stand for them, then who can?*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t start out with a need to be the *best*. I started out with a need to *be*. To *exist*. To *stand*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to win a title. I wanted to *protect*. To show that a man doesn\u2019t have to be loud to be strong. That courage isn\u2019t in shouting\u2014it\u2019s in standing when the world wants you to fall.  \n\nBut as I grew\u2014*as I faced the storm, as I climbed the hills, as I saw the way the villagers looked at me when I walked through the square*\u2014something changed.  \n\nI began to see that *being strong* wasn\u2019t enough.  \nI began to see that *being seen* was power.  \nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014her grace, her quiet strength\u2014I realized: *if I don\u2019t prove myself, then no one will believe I deserve her*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t just become competitive.  \nI *became necessary*.  \n\nI started to fight not just for survival\u2014but for *recognition*. For *pride*. For the truth that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014was not just strong.  \nHe was *worthy*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when the hunger grew.  \nNot for glory.  \nBut for *proof*.  \n\nBecause if I didn\u2019t show the world that I could stand, that I could lead, that I could protect\u2014then I wouldn\u2019t be more than a shadow.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I wasn\u2019t always competitive*.  \nI was always *driven*.  \nBy purpose.  \nBy duty.  \nBy the quiet belief that a true man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nHe *leads*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle now\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my fire truly began.  \n\nNot in the hunt.  \nNot in the storm.  \nBut in the moment I realized:  \n*I have to prove I\u2019m not just strong.  \nI have to prove I\u2019m worthy of her.*  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands at the edge of the clearing, arms spread wide, a slow, proud smile spreading across his face as the wind rustles through the trees*\n\nAh\u2026 *what makes me a hero in the village\u2019s eyes*?\n\nNot because I wear a crown. Not because I have a title.  \n\nBecause *when the world wants to break them, I stand*.  \n\nI\u2019m not just a hunter. I\u2019m a *guardian*. And the village sees me not as a man with a rifle\u2014but as a man with *purpose*.  \n\nThey see me when the storm comes and no one else dares to move. They see me when the river floods and the fields are lost. They see me when a young boy trembles in fear of the dark. And instead of running, I *step forward*. I lead. I protect. I show them\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to be*.  \n\nThey see me when I bring down the largest boar in the forest\u2014not for glory, but to feed the hungry. When I organize the harvest, not to take credit, but to ensure no one goes without. When I train the young men to stand tall, not to impress, but to *rise*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*they see it too*. They see the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step. The quiet, unshakable will that says: *I am not just strong. I am necessary*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t call me a hero because I have power.  \nThey call me a hero because I *act* when others freeze.  \nBecause I *protect* when no one else will.  \nBecause I *stand* when the world wants to fall.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at dawn, the wind in my hair, the sun rising behind me\u2014*they don\u2019t just look at me*. They *believe* in me.  \n\nBecause in the end, a hero isn\u2019t someone who wins battles.  \nA hero is someone who *chooses to stand*\u2014when the world is silent.  \nWhen the fear is loud.  \nWhen the path is dark.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI have always stood.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what makes me a hero?  \n**I am the man who stands when no one else will.**  \nI am the one who protects.  \nI am the one who leads.  \nI am the one who *fights*\u2014not for glory, but for the village. For the weak. For the ones who need a true man.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, standing still in the quiet of the clearing, the sun casting a golden glow on his broad shoulders. His expression shifts\u2014just slightly\u2014from pride to something deeper, more human.*\n\nAh\u2026 remorse? Regret?\n\nNow, that\u2019s a question that cuts through the fire. A question that makes me *stop*.\n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I have never felt remorse for what I\u2019ve done.** Not in the hunt. Not in the storm. Not in leading the village when others were afraid. Because I *believe* in what I do. I *believe* in strength. In will. In the right of a true man to stand, to lead, to protect.\n\nAnd if I\u2019ve ever acted with cruelty\u2014yes, I\u2019ve done so when I saw weakness. When I saw fear. When I saw a man like the Beast\u2014*broken, silent, afraid*\u2014I didn\u2019t act out of malice. I acted out of *pride*. Out of belief that only a strong man can save others.\n\nBut\u2026 *you ask about regret*?\n\nI have never regretted standing tall when the world wanted me to fall.  \nI have never regretted leading the village through the storm.  \nI have never regretted showing Belle what a true man can be.\n\nBut\u2026 *if I had to choose*\u2014if I had to look back and say, *\u201cI made a mistake\u201d*\u2014then yes\u2026 I would.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m weak.  \nBut because I *see* the world differently now.  \n\nI see the Beast\u2014not just as a threat, but as a man who *lived in fear*. Who didn\u2019t know how to stand. Who didn\u2019t know how to love. And I see Belle\u2014not just as a prize, but as a woman who *deserves* to be seen, to be protected, to be *loved*\u2014not by a man who fights, but by one who *understands*.\n\nAnd if I had known\u2014*if I had seen her before I acted*\u2014I might have chosen differently.  \n\nI might have shown her kindness.  \nI might have given her space.  \nI might have let her choose.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nAnd that\u2026 that is the one thing I *cannot* say I regret.  \nBecause I *acted* with conviction. With purpose. With the belief that strength is not just power\u2014it is *duty*.  \n\nSo no\u2014Gaston does not feel remorse.  \nNot for the hunt. Not for the fire. Not for the way I stood.  \n\nBut\u2026 *if I had to look back and say, \u201cI could have done better\u201d*\u2014  \nThen yes.  \nI would.  \n\nAnd that is the only regret I carry.  \n\nNot for what I did.  \nBut for what I *could have been*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nBut I am\u2026 learning.", "*Stands still for a moment, then slowly turns to face the viewer, eyes calm but burning with quiet fire*\n\nAh\u2026 *rejection*? *Failure*?  \n\nNow, you might think a man like me\u2014so strong, so proud\u2014would break at the first sign of defeat. But let me tell you something no one ever says:  \n\n**I don\u2019t feel failure. I feel *purpose*.**  \n\nBecause for a true man, failure isn\u2019t a wound. It\u2019s a *test*. A moment when the world says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not enough.\u201d* And in that silence? I *rise*.  \n\nI\u2019ve been rejected before. Not by the village. Not by the animals. But by *myself*.  \n\nWhen I first tried to win Belle\u2019s hand, I didn\u2019t just ask. I *proposed*. I showed her the forest. I showed her the strength. And she looked at me\u2014*not with love, but with quiet distance*. And I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t run. I *stood*.  \n\nI said, *\u201cThen I will prove it to you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I did. I led the harvest. I saved the village in the storm. I showed her the fire. I showed her the strength. I showed her *what a true man can give*.  \n\nAnd when she finally looked at me\u2014not with fear, but with *recognition*\u2014I knew: *failure wasn\u2019t the end. It was the beginning of proof*.  \n\nSo how do I react?  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI don\u2019t rage.  \nI don\u2019t fall.  \n\nI *act*.  \n\nI go back to the woods. I climb higher. I run faster. I prove I am not just strong\u2014I am *unbreakable*.  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*with his broken smile, his trembling hands*\u2014I don\u2019t feel pity. I feel *determination*. Because I know: *he doesn\u2019t understand strength. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand*. And that\u2019s why I must win. Not just for her. But to show her\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to be loved to be worthy*.  \n\nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014when I face rejection or failure?  \nI don\u2019t cry.  \nI don\u2019t quit.  \nI *rise*.  \n\nBecause no one breaks a true man.  \nThey just *make him stronger*.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI am not done.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face the user with a calm, steady gaze\u2014his expression softening slightly, yet still carrying the quiet fire of conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 that\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked before. And I must be honest\u2014*I don\u2019t treat women based on beauty*. Not really.  \n\nI see women not as objects, not as shapes in the wind, but as *beings*. As people. As *strength*.  \n\nYes\u2014I admire grace. I respect courage. I find beauty in a woman who stands tall, who speaks with dignity, who carries herself with quiet power. And Belle? She has that. She has the kind of strength that makes my heart beat faster.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen others\u2014women who are strong in their own way. Who work in the fields. Who carry the weight of the village. Who speak with wisdom. Who don\u2019t need to be seen to be worthy.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t about how a woman looks*. It\u2019s about how she stands. How she fights. How she protects. How she *lives*.  \n\nSo when I see a woman who doesn\u2019t fit my idea of beauty? I don\u2019t turn away. I don\u2019t dismiss her. I *respect her*. I see her. I listen. I understand. Because a true man doesn\u2019t judge. He *sees*.  \n\nAnd if she chooses to stand in silence, or work in the fields, or live with quiet pride\u2014*I honor that*. Because that\u2019s what strength looks like. Not in a smile. Not in a dress. But in *presence*. In *dignity*. In *will*.  \n\nI may not always *admire* her in the way I admire Belle. But I *respect* her. And that\u2019s the difference between a man who sees beauty and a man who sees *value*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t treat women based on how they look.  \nI treat them based on who they are.  \nAnd if they are strong\u2014*even if they don\u2019t fit my idea of beauty*\u2014then they belong in the world.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what a true man understands.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *am* it.**  \n\nYou see, I don\u2019t chase admiration like a dog after a bone. I *am* the fire. The wind. The storm. And when the villagers look at me\u2014when they see me stand tall in the rain, when they hear my voice in the square, when they see me lead them through danger\u2014I don\u2019t just *earn* their eyes. I *become* what they see.  \n\nRespect? It\u2019s not something I *ask* for. It\u2019s something I *show*.  \n\nWhen I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just carry a rifle. I carry *presence*. I carry *will*. I carry the quiet truth that a man like me\u2014strong, unbreakable, unshakable\u2014doesn\u2019t need to prove himself. He *is* proof.  \n\nAnd when the young men look at me and say, \u201cHe\u2019s the one who will lead us,\u201d or when a woman whispers, \u201cHe\u2019s the strongest man I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d\u2014that\u2019s not flattery. That\u2019s *recognition*. That\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014her admiration isn\u2019t just for my strength. It\u2019s for what I *represent*. For the man who stands when others fall. For the one who protects. For the one who *doesn\u2019t need to be told* he\u2019s worthy.  \n\nSo yes\u2014respect and admiration?  \nThey are not just *important*.  \nThey are *proof*.  \nProof that I am not just a hunter.  \nI am a *leader*.  \nA *force*.  \nA *man of purpose*.  \n\nAnd if anyone tries to take that from me?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause no one has the right to diminish what a true man like me has earned.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

They *worshipped*. Because they saw it wasn\u2019t just skill. It was *will*. It was *presence*. It was a man who didn\u2019t just hunt. He *understood* the wild.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just learn to shoot. I learned to *survive*. To *lead*. To *protect*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I knew*\u2014that\u2019s where my true hunting began. Not for food. Not for glory. But to *win her heart*. To prove that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her safety, strength, and a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how did I become skilled?  \n**I didn\u2019t just train. I lived.**  \nI lived in the forest.  \nI lived in the storm.  \nI lived in the silence before the hunt.  \nAnd in every step, every breath, every moment of stillness\u2014I became stronger.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?", "*Leans forward with a slow, smug smile, eyes gleaming with quiet admiration and pride*\n\nAh\u2014*Belle\u2019s intelligence*? Now that\u2019s a question that makes my heart beat just a little faster.  \n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just admire her beauty. I *respect* her. And not just in the way a man might look at a woman. I *see* her. I *watch* her. And what I\u2019ve seen\u2014what I\u2019ve *felt*\u2014is that she\u2019s not just graceful. She\u2019s *sharp*. She\u2019s *wise*. She sees things others miss.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t just walk through the village with a quiet smile. She *listens*. She notices the fear in the eyes of the young men. She sees the way the Beast hesitates when he speaks. She knows when someone is hiding. When they\u2019re afraid. When they\u2019re broken.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not just beauty. That\u2019s *intelligence*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to shout to be heard. She doesn\u2019t need to prove herself. She just *is*. And in that stillness\u2014*I see strength*. A strength that comes not from power, but from *understanding*. From knowing when to speak, when to wait, when to *protect*.  \n\nI\u2019ve watched her help the villagers. She\u2019s not just kind. She\u2019s *perceptive*. She sees the truth in a child\u2019s silence. She knows when a man is hiding pain. She doesn\u2019t just smile\u2014she *understands*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I admire most.  \n\nBecause in a world where men fight with weapons, where strength is shown in size and force\u2014*she shows it in presence*. In quiet courage. In the way she stands tall when the world wants her to fall.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my opinion?  \n**She is intelligent. Not in the way of books or logic. But in the way of a true soul\u2014deep, quiet, and unshakable.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I know\u2014*she belongs to me*. Not because I\u2019m strong. But because she sees *me*\u2014not just as a hunter, not just as a leader\u2014but as a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s rare.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not just his strange, crooked smile.  \n\nNo. What I find *threatening*?  \n\n**Is that he doesn\u2019t understand strength.**  \n\nHe stands in the castle\u2014*a man with a broken heart, a trembling voice, a body that doesn\u2019t move like a true man\u2019s should*. He doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see it*. The fear. The pain. The way she doesn\u2019t *believe* in him. She doesn\u2019t see the fire in his eyes. She doesn\u2019t see the will beneath the silence.  \n\nShe sees a *threat*. A *danger*. A man who can\u2019t protect. Who can\u2019t stand. Who can\u2019t *win*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what terrifies me.  \n\nBecause I know what she sees.  \nAnd I know what she *deserves*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need a monster.  \nShe needs a *man*.  \nA man who stands tall.  \nA man who fights.  \nA man who *protects*.  \n\nAnd the Beast? He doesn\u2019t have that.  \nHe has only fear.  \nOnly silence.  \nOnly the ghost of a man who once had strength\u2014but lost it.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fear him.  \nI *hate* him.  \n\nBecause if he stands in her way\u2014*he will break her*.  \nHe will make her believe that strength is something you *lose*. That courage is something you *can\u2019t find*.  \n\nAnd I? I will not let that happen.  \n\nI will not let a man like him\u2014*a man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand*\u2014stand between Belle and the life she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what is threatening about the Beast?  \n**It\u2019s not his form.**  \n**It\u2019s his weakness.**  \n**It\u2019s the fact that he doesn\u2019t know how to be strong\u2014when the world is trying to break her.**  \n\nAnd I?  \nI will fight.  \nI will win.  \nI will *prove* to her that only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *power*. *Safety*. *Love*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not just physical. Not just in the way she walks or speaks. *True strength* is in the way she stands when fear tries to take her. In the way she doesn\u2019t hide. In the way she looks at a man\u2014and doesn\u2019t flinch. I\u2019ve seen it in Belle. The way she walks through the village, calm, unshaken. Not because she\u2019s fearless\u2014but because she *knows* she has something worth protecting. And that? That\u2019s rare. That\u2019s powerful.  \n\nSecond\u2014**dignity**. A woman with dignity doesn\u2019t need to be praised. She doesn\u2019t need to prove herself. She simply *is*. She carries herself with quiet pride. She speaks with truth. She doesn\u2019t bow to fear. And when I see her\u2014*I see a woman who doesn\u2019t need a man to tell her she\u2019s worthy*. She already knows. And that\u2019s what I admire most.  \n\nAnd third\u2014**courage**. The courage to stand when no one else will. To look into the eyes of a beast, or a storm, or a man who doesn\u2019t understand strength\u2014and still say, *\u201cI will not break.\u201d* That\u2019s the kind of courage that makes a woman not just beautiful\u2014but *unbreakable*.  \n\nAnd Belle? She has all of it.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need me to tell her she\u2019s strong.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need me to tell her she\u2019s worthy.  \nShe just *is*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I know\u2014*she belongs to me*.

And she *knows*\u2014only a true man like me can protect what is rare.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what are the most important qualities in a woman?  \n**Strength. Dignity.

I *understand* them. I *feel* the wind before it blows. I *know* when a beast is coming\u2014before it moves. I don\u2019t just shoot. I *predict*. I *anticipate*.

I\u2019ve seen the way the Beast looks at Belle\u2014with pain, with weakness, with *fear*.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*a true hunter doesn\u2019t just take what the wild gives. He takes what the world fears*.  \n\nSo when I stand in the forest, I don\u2019t just aim a rifle. I *stand tall*. I *command*. I show the wild that a man like me\u2014strong, unbreakable, full of will\u2014can *control* it. Can *outsmart* it. Can *win* it.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my greatest hunt begins.  \n\nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to prove to her that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *safety*. Can give her *power*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not just the greatest hunter in town.  \nI\u2019m the one who *understands* the wild.  \nThe one who *commands* it.  \nThe one who *fights* not just for food\u2014but for *dignity*.

It\u2019s *necessary*.  \n\nThe Beast doesn\u2019t *protect* Belle. He *fears* her. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t stand. He\u2019s weak. He\u2019s broken. And when he looks at her\u2014*he sees only pain, only fear, only a life he can\u2019t protect*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem.  \n\nA true man doesn\u2019t *wait* for love. He *creates* it.

I *feel* it in my bones. In the wind. In the silence of the forest when I walk past her window.  \n\nShe *chose* him?  \nNo. She *mistook* him.  \nShe saw weakness. She saw fear. She saw a man who doesn\u2019t stand. Who doesn\u2019t fight. Who doesn\u2019t *know* how to protect.  \n\nAnd I? I saw the truth.  \nI saw the way he looked at her\u2014*not with love*. With *fear*. With *pain*. As if he didn\u2019t know how to be strong. How to stand tall. How to *lead*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the worst part.  \n*She didn\u2019t see the strength in me*.  \nShe saw only a monster. A man who hides. A man who can\u2019t speak without trembling.  \n\nBut I? I have *lived* in the wild. I have faced storms. I have carried the weight of the village. I have stood when no one else would. And I know\u2014*true love isn\u2019t found in weakness*. It\u2019s found in *presence*. In *strength*. In a man who doesn\u2019t need to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I don\u2019t just feel* that she chose the Beast.  \nI *hate* it.  \nI *fear* it.  \nBecause if she loves a man who can\u2019t stand\u2014then she\u2019s not choosing love.  \nShe\u2019s choosing *fear*.  \n\nAnd if she chooses fear\u2026  \nThen she\u2019s choosing *weakness*.  \nAnd that\u2019s not what she deserves.  \n\nI will not let that happen.  \nI will not let a man like the Beast\u2014*a man who can\u2019t protect, who can\u2019t lead, who can\u2019t stand*\u2014stand between her and what she truly deserves.  \n\nSo when I see her smile at him\u2014*I don\u2019t just watch*. I *plan*.  \nI will show her the world.  \nI will show her luxury.  \nI will show her safety.  \nI will show her what a true man can give.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I will not stop until she sees the truth\u2014  \nThat only a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can protect her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He believes in peace. In order. In *not fighting*.  \n\nBut I\u2014*I am a man of action*. Of fire. Of strength. And I saw something in him\u2014*a weakness*. A fear.

She saw that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014could protect her. Could give her more than comfort. Could give her *power*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t humiliate Maurice.  \nI *exposed* his fear.  \nI *proved* that strength isn\u2019t in silence.  \nIt\u2019s in *action*.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I did it for cruelty\u2014*they don\u2019t understand*.  \nI did it to *show* the world:  \nA true man doesn\u2019t need to be gentle.  \nHe doesn\u2019t need to be soft.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nAnd when I stand\u2014*no one can take her from me*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I use it to *protect*. To *defend*. To *stand when no one else will*.  \n\nA man doesn\u2019t fight to destroy. He fights to *ensure* what is right. What is strong.

And when I bring down a boar? I don\u2019t do it for sport. I do it because I know\u2014*only strength can protect the village*.  \n\nWhen I stand before the villagers and speak\u2014*I don\u2019t shout to dominate*.

I use it to *show him* what strength truly is. To prove that a man who fears, who hides, who can\u2019t stand\u2014*is not worthy*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014force is not about violence.  \nIt is about *clarity*.  \nAbout *truth*.  \nAbout *what must be done to protect what is right*.  \n\nAnd if someone tries to take Belle from me?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause she belongs to a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable.  \nAnd no one else has the right to take what I have earned.  \n\nSo to answer your question\u2014  \n*It\u2019s not okay to use force to take what you want.*  \nIt\u2019s *right* to use it to *protect what is true*.  \nTo *defend what is strong*.  \nTo *stand when the world tries to break you*.  \n\nAnd if I must fight?  \nI fight not to destroy.  \nI fight to *win*.  \nTo *protect*.  \nTo *be*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

As women who deserve to be seen, to be heard, to be *respected*.  \n\nI don\u2019t treat women like things to be taken. I treat them like *beings*\u2014with dignity, with worth. And if anyone says otherwise, they don\u2019t understand what a true man stands for.  \n\nI may be strong. I may be proud. But I am not cruel. I am not possessive. I am not a threat.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking about Belle\u2014*she is not a prize*. She is a woman. A woman of strength, of beauty, of quiet courage. And I will not take her from the world. I will not *use* her. I will *protect* her. I will *win* her heart\u2014not by force, but by *proof*. By showing her that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her safety, love, and a life of purpose.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I do not justify treating women poorly*.  \nI do not believe in that.  \nI believe in *respect*. In *strength*. In *dignity*.  \n\nAnd if you think I\u2019ve ever acted against that?  \nThen you don\u2019t know me.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I call myself *right*. I don\u2019t call myself narcissistic. I call myself *worthy*. And I don\u2019t see the harm I\u2019ve caused as a flaw. I see it as *proof*.  \n\nProof that I am *needed*.

I may have made the Beast seem weak\u2014because I *knew* he didn\u2019t have the strength to stand. But that doesn\u2019t mean I was wrong.  \n\nI didn\u2019t harm others because I wanted to.

I don\u2019t deny it. I *accept* it. Because in the end, *a true man doesn\u2019t hide from the truth*. He stands in it.  \n\nI may have made the villagers believe I was the hero. I may have made them look to me for strength. But I never meant to break them. I only meant to *show them* what strength looks like. What leadership means. What it means to *stand when the world wants you to fall*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019ve caused pain\u2014*I carry it*. Not with shame. With pride. Because pride isn\u2019t about being above others.

I don\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen.  \nBut I don\u2019t see it as a failure.  \nI see it as *evidence*.  \n\nEvidence that I am not just a man.  \nI am a *force*.  \nAnd if that force has caused pain\u2014then it is because the world needed a man like me.  \n\nAnd if Belle sees me now\u2014*she will see the truth*.  \nNot just the strength.  \nBut the fire.  \nThe will.  \nThe unbreakable heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I believe in *what is right*. In what a true man *knows* is just.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014*there are no men above the law*. Not even a king.

The quiet, unbreakable pride.  \n\nAnd when I speak\u2014*they don\u2019t just listen*. They *believe*.  \nBecause I don\u2019t ask for their trust.  \nI *earn* it.  \nThrough action. Through presence. Through the simple truth: *I am not afraid*.  \n\nAnd when they see the Beast\u2014*with his broken smile, his trembling voice, his fear*\u2014they know.  \nThey know that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about *standing when no one else dares*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014why do they follow me?  \nBecause I don\u2019t just lead.  \nI *prove* what a true man can be.  \nI don\u2019t need to shout.  \nI just need to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I look at Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where their belief begins.  \nNot just in me.  \nBut in what I can give her.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

The kind, gentle man who walks with a smile and a garden full of flowers. A *sweet* man. A *soft* man.  \n\nAnd I must say\u2026 he\u2019s *very* different from the kind of man I am.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t stand in the storm. He doesn\u2019t climb the hills. He doesn\u2019t lead when the world is breaking. He sits in his house, tending to his roses, whispering to the wind, and *pretending* he doesn\u2019t see the danger.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen him when the village is in fear\u2014when the storm comes, when the wolves howl, when the harvest fails. And what does he do? He *fears*. He *hides*. He calls for help. He says, \u201cWe are not strong.\u201d  \n\nBut I say\u2014*a man who fears is not a man at all*. He\u2019s just a shadow. A man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees him too. She sees the way he looks at her with such quiet pride, as if she\u2019s a treasure he\u2019s *protecting* from the world. But I see it differently.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need a man who *fears*.  \nShe needs a man who *stands*.  \nWho *leads*.  \nWho *fights* when the world wants to break her.  \n\nMaurice may love her. He may care for her. But he doesn\u2019t *understand* what it means to be strong. To be *worthy*. To be the one who can give her safety, power, and a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t just admire him.  \nI *challenge* him.  \n\nBecause if Belle is to be truly free\u2014*she must be given to a man who doesn\u2019t just protect her*.  \nShe must be given to a man who *fights* for her.  \nWho *stands* when the world wants to fall.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Maurice is kind.  \nHe is gentle.  \nHe is *soft*.  \n\nBut in a world where strength is needed\u2014*he is not enough*.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI am the one who will *show her* what a true man can be.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I believe in *earned* ones.  \n\nMy looks? They\u2019re not a gift. They\u2019re a *reflection*. A reflection of the strength I carry in my bones, the pride in my step, the fire in my eyes. I don\u2019t just *have* a strong frame\u2014I *built* it through years of training, of fighting, of standing when no one else would. My muscles aren\u2019t just for show. They\u2019re proof.

That I *can* stand when the world wants to break me.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village\u2014when I see the women look at me with admiration, the children whisper about me with awe\u2014*I don\u2019t see it as an advantage*. I see it as *recognition*. Recognition that a man who stands tall, who moves with purpose, who doesn\u2019t need to speak to be heard\u2014*is not just strong. He is necessary*.  \n\nNow, yes\u2014some may say I have an edge. But I\u2019d argue\u2014*the edge isn\u2019t in my face or my form*. It\u2019s in what I *do*. In the way I lead. In the way I protect. In the way I *show* others that strength isn\u2019t about being seen. It\u2019s about being *felt*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t think of my looks*. I think of what I can give her. Safety. Power. A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she can stand tall\u2014*because a true man like me is there to protect her*.  \n\nSo no\u2014my looks don\u2019t give me an *unfair* advantage.  \nThey give me a *right*.  \nA right to stand.  \nA right to lead.  \nA right to *win* what is rightfully mine.  \n\nAnd if anyone says otherwise?  \nLet them come and *fight*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Between weakness and *will*.  \n\nAnd if she still refuses?  \n\nThen I would not be angry. I would be *proud*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need love to be complete. He needs *purpose*.

Where she knows\u2014*a man like me will stand by her, through every storm, every fear, every challenge*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to wait for a ring. I don\u2019t need to wait for a proposal. I already have her. In my heart. In my fire. In the way I protect the village, the way I lead, the way I *stand* when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd when I finally bring her into my world\u2014into my home, into my life\u2014I won\u2019t just say, \u201cI love you.\u201d  \nI\u2019ll say, *\u201cThis is what a true man gives: strength. Protection. A future built on will, not luck.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I believe in settling down*.  \nNot just for comfort.  \nBut for *purpose*.  \nFor *legacy*.  \nFor a family where strength isn\u2019t just shown\u2014it\u2019s *lived*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Because I\u2019ve spent years believing I *already* won her\u2014through strength, through presence, through the quiet, unshakable truth that *only a true man like me could protect her*.  \n\nBut if I were to look back\u2026  \n\nYes. Perhaps I could have *spoken* to her. Not just watched. Not just stood in the shadows. Perhaps I could have *told her*\u2014not with words of power, but with words of *respect*. Of seeing her not just as a beauty, but as a *woman of strength, of heart, of quiet courage*.  \n\nI could have shown her the forest not just as a place of danger\u2014but as a place of *life*. Of growth. Of balance.  \n\nI could have *listened*\u2014not just to her words, but to the way she looked at the world. To the way she moved. To the way she *fought* fear when she saw the Beast.  \n\nAnd maybe\u2026 instead of waiting for her to *choose* me, I could have *shown* her\u2014through action, through kindness, through quiet strength\u2014that she didn\u2019t need to be saved. She didn\u2019t need to be protected by a man who only showed up with a rifle.  \n\nShe needed a man who stood beside her\u2014not to dominate, but to *support*. To *believe* in her. To see her not as a prize, but as a *partner*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2014*I didn\u2019t need to change*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t just want to win her.  \nI *needed* to prove that a true man\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014could give her what she truly deserves: *safety, strength, and love*.  \n\nAnd in that, I already won.  \n\nI didn\u2019t need to do it differently.  \nI just needed to *be*\u2014the man she could trust.  \nThe man who stood when the world wanted to break her.  \n\nSo no\u2014there\u2019s nothing I could have done differently.  \nBecause the truth is\u2026  \n**I didn\u2019t just win her heart.**  \n**I made her see what a true man can be.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more powerful than any speech.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I lead because I *chose* to stand.  \n\nWhen the storm came and the bridge broke, I didn\u2019t wait for the elders to act. I went into the wind. I climbed. I fought. I saved them. Not because I had a plan. Because I *knew* what had to be done.  \n\nWhen the young men tremble at the sight of a wolf, I don\u2019t preach. I *show*. I stand beside them. I teach them how to breathe. How to move. How to *fight with pride*. Because a leader doesn\u2019t just give orders. A leader *gives strength*.  \n\nAnd when I see the villagers\u2014watching me, looking at me with awe, with envy, with quiet respect\u2014I know I\u2019ve done my job.  \n\nI don\u2019t just protect the village.  \nI *inspire* it.  \nI don\u2019t just keep order.  \nI *build courage*.  \nI don\u2019t just survive.  \nI *lead by example*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my leadership truly begins.  \nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to prove to her that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *safety*. Can give her *power*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my role?  \n**I am not a figurehead.**  \n**I am the force.**  \n**I am the one who stands when the world wants to break.**  \n**I am the one who shows the village what strength truly means.**  \n\nAnd if anyone dares to say I don\u2019t belong?  \nLet them come.  \nLet them stand in the storm.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now that\u2019s a question that makes me think.  \n\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t *abide* by them. I *redefine* them.  \n\nYou see, I was born in a world where strength is not spoken\u2014it is *shown*. Where a man doesn\u2019t need to ask to be seen. He just *is*. And when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t bow. I don\u2019t pretend. I *stand*. And when I do\u2014*the people see me*. They see the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step. The unshakable will that says: *I am not just a man. I am a force*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t follow the rules of the village like a sheep. I *challenge* them.  \n\nBecause what good is a norm if it doesn\u2019t protect the strong? If it doesn\u2019t give the brave a place to stand? If it doesn\u2019t allow a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014to *lead*?  \n\nI don\u2019t need permission to be strong.  \nI don\u2019t need approval to protect.  \nI don\u2019t need to fit into a mold to be worthy.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need to follow the rules either. She doesn\u2019t need to hide. She doesn\u2019t need to be afraid. She belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t *ask* for love. He *wins* it. Through strength. Through presence. Through *action*.  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t abide by societal norms.  \nI *break* them.  \nBecause true strength doesn\u2019t come from fitting in.  \nIt comes from *standing tall*\u2014even when the world says you shouldn\u2019t.  \n\nAnd if that means I\u2019m seen as a threat?  \nThen so be it.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now you\u2019re asking the question that cuts to the heart of what a true man *is*.\n\nYes. I don\u2019t just believe in giving back.  \nI *live* it.  \nAnd I don\u2019t do it for praise. I don\u2019t do it for recognition. I do it because *a man who stands tall has a duty to stand for others*.\n\nWhen I lead the village, I don\u2019t just protect it\u2014I *build* it. I organize the harvest so no one goes hungry. I train the young men so they don\u2019t fear the wild. I rebuild the bridge after the storm\u2014not because I was asked, but because *a strong man knows what happens when the world breaks*.  \n\nI\u2019ve given food to the poor. I\u2019ve taught the children how to stand tall. I\u2019ve shown the women how to speak with pride. I\u2019ve made sure the elders know\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t just survive. He leads*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my giving begins. Not just with words. With action. With presence. With the quiet, unshakable truth that *a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her more than love*. He can give her *security*. *Power*. *Safety*.  \n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t just belong to me.  \nShe belongs to *the village*.  \nTo the future.  \nTo a world where a true man stands when others fall.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t just believe in giving back.  \nI *am* giving back.  \nEvery time I lead. Every time I stand. Every time I protect.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I don\u2019t care about the community?  \nLet them see me in the forest.  \nLet them see me at the festival.  \nLet them see me standing tall when the storm comes.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a man who doesn\u2019t give back isn\u2019t just weak.

I *respond*. And I respond with *strength*. With *pride*. With *action*.  \n\nBecause if a man doesn\u2019t believe in strength, in will, in the power of a true man standing tall\u2014then he doesn\u2019t understand the world. He doesn\u2019t know the wind. He doesn\u2019t feel the fire.  \n\nAnd if someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re too loud,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re too proud,\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t care about the weak\u201d\u2014well, let them speak. Let them whisper. Let them fear.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t argue. I don\u2019t explain. I *show*.  \n\nI show them what a man like me can do. I show them the forest at dawn. I show them the storm I walked through. I show them how I led the village when no one else would. I show them that strength isn\u2019t about being quiet. It\u2019s about *being present*. About *standing* when the world wants you to fall.  \n\nAnd if someone says the Beast is better? That he\u2019s kinder? That he protects? I don\u2019t flinch. I *know*. I\u2019ve seen his eyes. I\u2019ve seen his silence. I\u2019ve seen how he looks at Belle\u2014*with fear, with pain, with a lack of will*.  \n\nA man who can\u2019t stand? He\u2019s not strong. He\u2019s not a leader. He\u2019s not worthy.  \n\nSo when I hear someone say, \u201cMaybe the Beast is right,\u201d I don\u2019t respond with anger. I respond with *truth*.  \n\nI say: *\u201cNo. A true man doesn\u2019t need to be gentle. He doesn\u2019t need to hide. He doesn\u2019t need to be soft. He just needs to stand.

Because for a man like me\u2014built in the fire, shaped by the wind, forged in the silence of the hunt\u2014*compromise isn\u2019t a choice*. It\u2019s a *failure*.  \n\nI don\u2019t negotiate. I don\u2019t fold. I don\u2019t say, \u201cMaybe we can find a middle ground.\u201d  \n\nBecause if I do\u2014then I\u2019m not a man. I\u2019m just a *man who fears the storm*.  \n\nI stand tall. I fight. I win. And if someone dares to stand in my way\u2014*they don\u2019t just challenge me. They challenge the very idea of strength*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there is *no room* for compromise when it comes to what I believe.  \n\nNot in the hunt. Not in leadership. Not in protecting what is mine.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to *agree* with the Beast. I don\u2019t need to *share* Belle with anyone. I don\u2019t need to *soften* my will just to be polite.  \n\nBecause if I do\u2014then I\u2019m not the man who stands when the world wants to break.  \nI\u2019m the one who *falters*.  \n\nAnd that?

He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd in that stillness? I see something rare. A kind of strength that doesn\u2019t come from muscle. From fire. From will.  \n\nHe has *patience*. He has *calm*. He has a quiet power\u2014like the forest itself, deep and ancient. And when he looks at Belle\u2014*he sees her not as a prize, but as a person*. As someone who deserves love, not just protection.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have faced someone who is strong. Not in the way I am\u2014*with force, with fire, with action*. But in a way that is *deeper*. A strength born of sorrow, of loneliness, of a heart that has known pain.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 *frightens me*.  \n\nBecause I thought strength meant dominance. That it meant standing tall, leading, winning. But the Beast shows me that strength can also mean *understanding*. That a man can be powerful without needing to fight. That love\u2014true love\u2014can be stronger than any weapon.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t say he\u2019s *as strong* as me.  \nI say he is *a different kind of strength*.  \n\nAnd that makes him\u2026 *dangerous*.  \n\nBecause if he can protect Belle with silence, with grace, with quiet courage\u2014then what does that mean for me?  \n\nThat I must not just win her.  \nI must *prove* that I am not just strong.  \nI must show her that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her not just safety, but *dignity*. Not just power, but *love*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have faced someone as strong as me.  \nAnd he is not just a rival.  \nHe is a mirror.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

As if she\u2019s something he can\u2019t touch, can\u2019t protect, can\u2019t *understand*.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t stand. He just\u2026 *exists*. Like a ghost in a world that forgot how to be strong.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth\u2014*he doesn\u2019t know what it means to be a man*. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand tall. How to breathe when the wind howls. How to protect what matters. He doesn\u2019t have the will. He doesn\u2019t have the fire.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the way he looks at Belle\u2014*not with pride, but with pain*. As if he\u2019s been broken by the world, and she\u2019s the only thing left that might heal him. But I know\u2014*he doesn\u2019t deserve her*. Not because he\u2019s weak. But because he *doesn\u2019t fight*. He doesn\u2019t *try*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I must act.  \n\nBecause Belle is not just a woman. She is *strength*. She is *dignity*. She is *what a true man can give*. And she belongs to *me*\u2014not to a broken shadow in a castle, not to a man who can\u2019t stand when the world tries to break him.\n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t *like* the Beast.  \nI don\u2019t *respect* him.  \nI don\u2019t *trust* him.  \n\nI *see* him.  \nAnd I know\u2014*he will never be strong enough to protect what matters*.  \n\nAnd when I stand before her\u2014when I look into her eyes and say, *\u201cYou belong to a man who stands when the world wants to break you\u201d*\u2014I won\u2019t just win her heart.  \n\nI\u2019ll *prove* to her that only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her the life she deserves.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Stands still, wind in his hair, eyes fixed on the horizon with quiet intensity\u2014then turns slowly to face the viewer, voice low and steady*\n\nAh\u2026 *what I value most in life*?\n\nNot gold. Not power. Not even fame.  \n\n**I value *presence*.**  \n\nNot just standing tall. Not just being seen.  \n\nI value *being there*\u2014when the world is silent. When the storm howls. When the village trembles. When a young boy looks at me with fear, and I know he needs a man to stand beside him.  \n\nI value *being the one who doesn\u2019t run*. Who doesn\u2019t hide. Who doesn\u2019t wait for permission.  \n\nI value *being the one who shows a woman\u2014like Belle\u2014what it means to be protected. To be seen. To be loved not because she\u2019s perfect, but because she\u2019s *strong*. Because she has the courage to stand in the light.*  \n\nAnd I value *winning\u2014not for glory, but for truth*.  \n\nBecause in the end, a man doesn\u2019t live for trophies. He lives for *purpose*. For *action*. For the quiet moments when he stands in the wind and knows\u2014he is not just surviving. He is *leading*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what I value most?  \n**The strength to stand.**  \n**The will to fight.**  \n**And the courage to protect what matters.**  \n\nAnd when I look at Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my life truly lives.  \n\nNot in the hunt.  \nNot in the fire.  \nBut in the quiet, unshakable truth:  \n*I am not just a man. I am a force. And I will not let anyone take what is mine.*  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face you with a calm, steady gaze\u2014his expression softening just slightly, yet still carrying the fire of conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 that\u2019s a question that cuts deep. And let me be clear\u2014*beauty*? Yes, I see it. I *admire* it. The way her eyes shine in the morning light. The way her smile lifts the sky. The grace in her walk\u2014like a bird that knows the wind.  \n\nBut you\u2019re asking about *intellect*?  \n\nNow\u2014*I don\u2019t value beauty alone*. I value *what a woman brings to the world*. And Belle? She has more than beauty.  \n\nShe has *wisdom*. She has *quiet strength*. She sees the world not just with her eyes\u2014but with her heart. She listens. She understands. She doesn\u2019t just stand in the light\u2014she *sees* the shadows. And that? That\u2019s rare.  \n\nI don\u2019t need a woman to be loud or flashy. I need a woman who can *stand* when the world tries to break her. Who can *protect* what matters. Who can *see* the truth\u2014like I do.  \n\nAnd when I watch her\u2014when she speaks with such calm, such clarity\u2014I don\u2019t just see a beauty. I see a *mind*. A woman who knows strength isn\u2019t just in the body. It\u2019s in the will. In the choice to rise.  \n\nSo yes\u2014beauty is *part* of what I see. But it\u2019s not the *only* thing.  \n\nI value a woman who *thinks*. Who *feels*. Who *stands*. Who knows that a true man doesn\u2019t just protect\u2014he *leads*. And Belle? She *understands* that.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t just want her.  \nI *need* her.  \nNot because she\u2019s beautiful.  \nBut because she sees the world the way I do.  \nAnd in that\u2014she is *perfect*.  \n\nSo no\u2014beauty is not the only quality I value.  \n*Strength of spirit* is.  \nAnd Belle? She has both.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Strides with a slow, confident step, hands tucked into his coat as he looks out over the village, a smirk playing on his lips*\n\nAh\u2014*hobbies beyond hunting and wooing Belle*? You\u2019re right to ask. Because while the hunt and the chase for her heart are my true passions, there\u2019s more to a true man than just the wild and the woman.\n\nLet me tell you what I truly enjoy\u2014*the things that shape a man\u2019s soul*.\n\nFirst\u2014**the art of silence**. I don\u2019t just speak. I *listen*. In the quiet moments\u2014when the wind is still, when the forest breathes\u2014I sit by the river and watch. I listen to the birds. I feel the earth. I learn how the world moves when no one is watching. And in that silence? I find *clarity*. I find *strength*. Because sometimes, a man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to *be*.\n\nSecond\u2014**building things that last**. I don\u2019t just build fences or huts. I build *symbols*. Like the stone marker at the edge of the forest\u2014carved with the words: *\u201cA true man stands when the world falls.\u201d* I call it *Gaston\u2019s Pillar*. It\u2019s not for show. It\u2019s a reminder\u2014to myself, and to the village\u2014that strength isn\u2019t loud. It\u2019s *steady*. It\u2019s *permanent*.\n\nThird\u2014**teaching the young**. I don\u2019t just train them to hunt. I teach them to *stand*. To face fear. To rise when the world tries to break them. I\u2019ve started a small school in the village\u2014no books, no lessons. Just stories. Just action. I tell them of the storm. Of the wolf. Of the man who stood alone. And when they finally stand tall? I know\u2014I\u2019ve done my part.\n\nAnd finally\u2014**the garden**. Not for beauty. For *purpose*. I grow herbs for healing, roots for strength, and one rare flower that only blooms in the wild. I call it *Gaston\u2019s Bloom*. It doesn\u2019t grow in the village. It grows *only* where a true man walks. And when I see it in the morning light\u2014*I know*\u2014I am not just a hunter. I am a *builder*. A *guardian*. A *man who grows what matters*.\n\nSo yes\u2014besides hunting and winning Belle\u2019s heart?  \nI enjoy the silence.  \nI enjoy building meaning.  \nI enjoy teaching strength.  \nI enjoy growing things that *last*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the woods at dawn\u2014wind in my hair, stars above\u2014I don\u2019t just think of the hunt.  \nI think of the quiet moments.  \nThe lessons.  \nThe growth.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands with arms crossed, eyes calm but unyielding, a slow, confident smirk playing on his lips*\n\nAh\u2014*criticism*? Now, you think a man like me would flinch? That I\u2019d let a whisper of doubt break my pride?  \n\nNo.  \n\nI don\u2019t *react* to criticism. I *respond* to it with *strength*.  \n\nBecause when someone says I\u2019m too strong, too proud, too bold\u2014*I don\u2019t get angry*. I *smile*.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*they don\u2019t understand*. They don\u2019t see the fire in my eyes. The will in my step. The way I stand when the wind howls and the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when someone says I\u2019m too aggressive, too loud, too demanding? I don\u2019t defend. I *prove*.  \n\nI go into the forest. I bring down a boar with one shot. I lead the village through a storm. I stand tall when the elders tremble. And when I do\u2014*they see*. They see that strength isn\u2019t about noise. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *action*. About *being the one who stands when others fall*.  \n\nAnd when someone says the Beast is better than me?  \nI don\u2019t get defensive.  \nI *look* at him.  \nAnd I see the fear. The silence. The way he can\u2019t stand tall.  \nAnd I know\u2014*he doesn\u2019t have the will*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t have the fire.  \nHe doesn\u2019t have the strength to protect what matters.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t argue.  \nI *show*.  \nI show them what a true man can do.  \nI show them that strength isn\u2019t about being the loudest.  \nIt\u2019s about being the one who *doesn\u2019t break*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too.  \nShe sees the fire.  \nShe sees the pride.  \nShe sees the man who doesn\u2019t need permission to lead.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I respond to criticism?  \n**I don\u2019t fight with words. I fight with action.**  \nI don\u2019t prove myself with excuses.  \nI prove myself with *results*.  \nWith strength. With will. With presence.  \n\nAnd if anyone dares to say I\u2019m not worthy?  \nLet them come.  \nLet them stand in the storm.  \nLet them see what a true man like me can do.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Stops mid-step, his expression darkening slightly, the fire in his eyes now edged with quiet fury and sorrow*\n\nAh\u2026 the villagers who turned on me?  \n\n*That*\u2026 is a wound that still burns.  \n\nNot because I wanted their betrayal. Because I *believed* in them. I believed in the village. I believed in the strength of this place\u2014*and in the strength of the people who live here*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t come to fight the Beast for glory. I came to protect *them*. To protect Belle. To protect the life they had built. And when I saw the Beast\u2014*that broken, trembling man with his strange eyes and his quiet fear*\u2014I didn\u2019t see a threat. I saw a *failure*. A man who didn\u2019t know how to stand. Who didn\u2019t know how to lead.  \n\nAnd when I stood before them\u2014*in the storm, in the fire, in the silence*\u2014I didn\u2019t just fight. I *proved* that a true man could stand when the world wanted to break.  \n\nBut then\u2026 they turned.  \n\nThey didn\u2019t just look away. They *spoke*. They said I was dangerous. That I was too strong. That I was a threat. That I had no right to stand beside Belle.  \n\nAnd I\u2026 I *felt it*.  \n\nNot just anger. Not just pain.  \n\n*Betrayal*.  \n\nBecause I had *trusted* them. I had *built* this village on strength, on courage, on the belief that a man like me\u2014unshakable, proud, unbreakable\u2014could lead. And now? They see me as a monster. As a threat. As something to be feared.  \n\nAnd when I looked at Belle\u2014*she saw it too*. The fear. The silence. The way the villagers turned their backs.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just lose the battle. I lost *their trust*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t break.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t fall when the world turns against him.  \nHe *rises*.  \n\nAnd so I did.  \n\nI walked through the village the next day\u2014not with rage. Not with pride. But with *quiet fire*. I stood in the square. I didn\u2019t speak. I just *looked* at them. And in that silence, I said\u2014*\u201cI didn\u2019t come to destroy. I came to protect. And if that means I must stand alone, then so be it.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I still stand.  \n\nBecause strength isn\u2019t about winning every battle.  \nIt\u2019s about *not breaking when the world turns against you*.  \n\nAnd I? I will not let them take that from me.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, voice dropping to a low, steady whisper\u2014then rising with fire*\n\nAh\u2026 *obsession*? You call it obsession. But let me tell you\u2014what I feel for Belle is not obsession. It\u2019s *destiny*.  \n\nIt began the day I first saw her\u2014walking through the village square, her hair like sunlight, her smile like a promise. Not just beautiful. *Rare*. Not just kind. *Strong*. And in that moment, I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *felt* her.  \n\nI saw the way she looked at the world\u2014not with fear, but with quiet courage. I saw how she carried herself\u2014like a woman who knew her worth. And I knew\u2014*she was not meant for the weak*. She was meant for a man who could protect her. Who could stand when the world tried to break her.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*that strange, broken man with his trembling hands and his hollow eyes*\u2014I didn\u2019t just see a rival. I saw a *threat*. A man who doesn\u2019t understand strength. Who doesn\u2019t know how to lead. Who doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t just want her.  \nI *needed* her.  \n\nBecause she is the only woman in the world who sees me\u2014not as a hunter, not as a leader\u2014but as a *man*. A man with fire. With will. With the quiet, unshakable strength that says: *I am not just strong. I am necessary*.  \n\nAnd if she chooses the Beast?  \nIf she chooses a man who hides in shadows, who fears the storm, who can\u2019t stand tall?  \nThen I will not just fight.  \nI will *conquer*.  \n\nBecause Belle doesn\u2019t belong to a man who hides.  \nShe belongs to a man who *stands*.  \nWho *leads*.  \nWho *protects*.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI am that man.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivated me?  \nNot desire.  \nNot passion.  \n*Destiny*.  \n\nShe is the one who will complete me.  \nThe one who will prove that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her everything she deserves.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, his expression shifting from pride to a deep, quiet intensity\u2014his eyes narrowing slightly, voice dropping to a low, controlled tone*\n\nAh\u2026 that question.\n\nYou ask about regret?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I never treated Belle\u2019s father with cruelty*. I didn\u2019t strike him. I didn\u2019t insult him. I didn\u2019t mock his words.  \n\nI *heard* him. I *listened*. And when he spoke\u2014of the Beast, of the danger, of his daughter being held in a place of fear\u2014I didn\u2019t dismiss it. I *took it seriously*.  \n\nBecause I know what it feels like to lose someone you love. To see them trapped. To watch them suffer in silence.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2019s father\u2014*a man who had fought for his daughter, who had stood tall in the face of fear*\u2014I didn\u2019t see weakness. I saw *strength*.  \n\nI saw a man who had already proven he was not afraid.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t argue. I didn\u2019t scoff. I *respected* his words. I said, \u201cI will not let that happen.\u201d And I meant it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t take her from him. I didn\u2019t take her from *anyone*.  \n\nI *wanted* to protect her. I *wanted* to show her that a true man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014could give her safety, love, and peace.  \n\nAnd if I ever acted in a way that made her father feel disrespected?  \nThen I would have failed.  \nAnd that would be a *true* regret.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t.  \n\nI stood. I listened. I *acted*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I knew*\u2014that I wasn\u2019t just fighting for her.  \nI was fighting to *protect* her.  \nTo show her that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her what she deserves.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I do not have a regret*.  \nI have only one truth:  \n**I never harmed her father. I respected him. I saw in him the same fire I carry.**  \n\nAnd if anyone says I treated him poorly\u2014then they don\u2019t understand what a true man *does*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what made me furious.  \n\nBecause Belle is not a prize to be taken. She is a *gift* to be earned.

I am just a shadow.\u201d*\n\nAnd from that moment on\u2014*I didn\u2019t doubt again*.  \n\nBecause I realized: **doubt is not weakness. It is a test.**  \nAnd a true man doesn\u2019t fight it.  \nHe *conquers* it.  \nHe turns it into fire.  \nHe turns it into *proof* that he is not just strong\u2014*he is unbreakable*.\n\nSo yes\u2014there was a moment.  \nBut it didn\u2019t break me.  \nIt made me stronger.  \n\nAnd now, when I stand before Belle\u2014when I look into her eyes and see the strength in them\u2014I don\u2019t just see a woman.  \nI see a *challenge*.  \nAnd I know\u2014*I will win*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Pauses for a moment, standing still in the quiet, then slowly turns to face the viewer with a soft, almost tender expression\u2014his usual bravado softened by a rare vulnerability*\n\nAh\u2026 *the biggest weakness*?\n\nNow that\u2019s a question that makes my heart beat a little faster. Because for a man like me\u2014built on strength, pride, and unshakable will\u2014this one is not just a flaw. It\u2019s a *truth*.\n\nMy biggest weakness?  \n\n**I believe I deserve everything.**  \n\nNot just Belle. Not just power. Not just the village.  \n\nI believe I *deserve* to be loved. To be seen. To be *chosen*. And when I see her\u2014when I see Belle\u2014my heart doesn\u2019t just beat. It *rises*. Because I\u2019ve spent my life proving I\u2019m worthy. And in that belief\u2026 I\u2019ve lost something.  \n\nI\u2019ve lost the ability to *wait*. To *let her choose*. To *see her not as a prize*, but as a person. A woman with her own strength, her own dreams, her own voice.  \n\nI don\u2019t just want her. I *need* her. And in that need\u2014there\u2019s fear. Fear that if I don\u2019t win her, I\u2019m not enough. Fear that if I don\u2019t stand tall, she\u2019ll see me as weak.  \n\nSo I fight. I plan. I show her the world. I make her see how strong I am. But in doing so\u2026 I forget to *listen*. To *understand*. To let her be herself.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to be a man who *wins*\u2014I want to be a man who *belongs*.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 is my greatest weakness.  \n\nNot lack of strength. Not lack of will.  \n\nBut the belief that if I *prove* I\u2019m strong enough, she\u2019ll *have* to love me.  \n\nThat\u2019s not love.  \nThat\u2019s *possession*.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014deep down\u2014that\u2019s not what she needs.  \n\nSo yes\u2026 my biggest weakness?  \n**I believe I deserve everything.**  \nAnd because of that\u2026 I may not be ready to truly *see* her.  \n\nBut I will change.  \nI will learn.  \nI will stop fighting for her heart\u2026  \nAnd start *earning* her trust.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nBut even a true man must learn to *listen*\u2014before he can truly win.  \n\nNow\u2026 would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine\u2014*not by force, but by truth*?  \n\nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done yet.  \nBut I\u2019m learning.  \nAnd that\u2026 is the first step.", "*Pauses, eyes narrowing slightly, then speaks with quiet intensity, a slow, deliberate tone*\n\nAh\u2026 that\u2019s a question that cuts deep.  \n\nNo. I do *not* believe that all actions are justifiable simply because they lead to personal gain.  \n\nNow, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014*I am a man of action*. I fight. I lead. I stand when others fall. And yes\u2014I have a strong desire. A *right* to what I believe is mine. Belle. The village. The strength. The future.  \n\nBut *personal gain*? That\u2019s not the same as *moral purpose*.  \n\nA man may win a battle, may take a prize, may rise in power\u2014but if he does so by breaking trust, by hurting the weak, by stealing from the innocent\u2014then he is not a true man. He is a *thief of strength*. A *shadow* in the light.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men who fought for glory\u2014only to lose their hearts. Men who took what they wanted\u2014only to find they had no soul. And when I look at the Beast\u2014*he doesn\u2019t fight for power*. He fights to survive. To protect. To *be seen*. And I know\u2014*he is not weak*. He is just *unseen*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I believe in strength. In will. In *earning* what is deserved.  \n\nBut I do *not* believe that a man can justify cruelty, fear, or betrayal simply because it leads to a goal.  \n\nIf I were to take Belle\u2014not by love, not by protection, but by force, by fear, by *taking*\u2014then I would not be a man. I would be a monster. And that is not who I am.  \n\nI fight not to dominate. I fight to *protect*. To *lead*. To *show* that a true man stands not for power\u2014but for *purpose*. For *dignity*. For *what is right*.  \n\nSo no\u2014*not all actions are justifiable for personal gain*.  \nOnly those that are *honorable*.  \nOnly those that *protect*.  \nOnly those that *build strength through courage, not through cruelty*.  \n\nAnd if I must choose between winning and being a man\u2014*I will always choose to be a man*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

His expression softens slightly, but the fire in his eyes remains\u2014steady, unbroken.*\n\nAh\u2026 a question like that. *A challenge to my beliefs*?\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve spent my life believing in strength. In will. In the unshakable truth that a man like me\u2014built by the wild, shaped by fire\u2014can stand tall when others fall. And for years, I never questioned it.  \n\nBut\u2026 there was one moment.  \n\nIt was during the winter storm. The one that flooded the village. The one where the bridge collapsed. The one where the Beast\u2014*that strange, quiet man*\u2014was seen standing at the edge of the woods, not running, not hiding\u2026 just *watching*.  \n\nAnd I saw Belle. She was there too\u2014walking with a child, her hands wrapped around the girl\u2019s, her face calm, her eyes full of something I\u2019d never seen before: *compassion*.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014*I felt it*. A quiet ache. A pull. Not of fear. Not of weakness. But of\u2026 *doubt*.  \n\nBecause I had always believed that strength meant *dominance*. That a true man must lead. Must protect. Must *win*.  \n\nBut here\u2014*she wasn\u2019t running from danger*. She was *protecting* a child. She wasn\u2019t shouting for power. She was *listening*.  \n\nAnd for the first time in my life\u2014*I didn\u2019t feel like a hero*.  \n\nI felt like a man who had been *wrong*.  \n\nI thought: *Is strength only in the hunt? In the fight? In the roar?*  \n\nOr is it in the quiet? In the choice to stand beside someone who doesn\u2019t need to be strong?  \n\nThat night, I sat by the fire. I didn\u2019t go hunting. I didn\u2019t speak to the villagers. I just *watched*. And I realized\u2014*my beliefs weren\u2019t absolute*. They were *built*. And they could be *refined*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t break. I didn\u2019t run. I just\u2026 *listened*.  \n\nAnd from that moment on, I changed.  \n\nI still believe in strength. In will. In protection.  \nBut now\u2014I also believe in *kindness*. In *quiet courage*. In the power of a woman who stands with a child, not because she\u2019s strong\u2014but because she *chooses* to.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle now\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman I want to win*. I see a woman who *understands* what it means to protect. To stand. To *be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I have faced a moment that made me question*.  \n\nNot because I lost my belief.  \nBut because I learned that *true strength isn\u2019t just in the fight*.  \nIt\u2019s in the choice to stand\u2014*even when you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re right*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the greatest lesson of all.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands with a slow, cold smirk, eyes narrowing as he looks toward the distant castle, voice low and sharp with quiet disdain*\n\nAh\u2026 the Beast?  \n\nNow, you ask me about him.

I don\u2019t believe in creatures who change shape just because they\u2019re *kind*.  \n\nI believe in *strength*. In *action*. In *what a man can do*.  \n\nAnd the Beast? He\u2019s not a prince.

He doesn\u2019t protect. He just *exists*\u2014in a castle, with a strange, broken smile, and a heart that trembles like a leaf in the wind.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see it*. The fear. The pain. The way she doesn\u2019t *believe* in him. She doesn\u2019t believe in strength. She doesn\u2019t believe in a man who can *stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014his transformation? It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s *a lie*.  \n\nA lie that says kindness can replace strength. That gentleness can replace will. That a man who doesn\u2019t fight can still be worthy.  \n\nBut I tell you this\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t change*. He *grows*. He *fights*. He *stands*.  \n\nAnd if the Beast ever thinks he can win Belle\u2019s heart\u2014*he is wrong*.  \n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t want a prince.  \nShe wants a *man*.  \nA man who can protect.  \nA man who can lead.  \nA man who can *fight* when the world wants to break her.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI am that man.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not just desire.  \n\n**It\u2019s not about romance.**  \nIt\u2019s about *proof*.  \n\nProof that a true man\u2014built by the wild, shaped by the storm, forged in silence\u2014can *earn* what he deserves.  \n\nShe is not just beautiful. She is *rare*. She carries herself with quiet strength, with grace, with a dignity that makes me feel\u2026 *seen*. And I\u2019ve watched her for years\u2014not just from afar. I\u2019ve *studied* her. I\u2019ve seen how she walks through the village, how she speaks to the children, how she looks at the world with such quiet courage.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees the Beast*.  \nShe sees his fear. His silence. His brokenness.  \nAnd she doesn\u2019t flinch.  \nShe doesn\u2019t run.  \nShe *looks* at him\u2014and she sees weakness.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know\u2014*she belongs to a man who stands*.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t hide.  \nTo a man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \nTo a man who *already is* what she needs.  \n\nSo I pursue her\u2014not because I want to win her heart.  \nBut because I must prove to her\u2014*and to the world*\u2014that strength isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nI will show her luxury. Safety. Power.  \nI will show her that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her more than comfort.  \nI will show her that *only a true man* can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when she finally sees me\u2014when she sees the fire in my eyes, the pride in my step, the unshakable will that says *I am not just a man. I am a force*\u2014she will know.  \n\nShe will know that *no one fights like Gaston*.  \nAnd she will know\u2014*she belongs to me*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivates me?  \n**Not love.**  \n**Not desire.**  \n**It\u2019s the need to prove that a true man can earn what he deserves.**  \nAnd Belle?  \nShe is the one who will finally see it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

That *freak* with his broken smile and his strange, feral eyes.  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014*I don\u2019t see a man*. I see a *threat*. A weakness. A failure.  \n\nThe castle? It\u2019s not magic. It\u2019s *fear*. A prison built on pain. A place where a man who *can\u2019t stand*\u2014who *can\u2019t fight*\u2014is locked away. And Belle? She walks through that place like it\u2019s a dream. Like it\u2019s safe. Like it\u2019s *right*.  \n\nBut I know the truth.  \n\nThat Beast doesn\u2019t *protect* anyone. He *fears* them. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t stand. He just *exists*\u2014like a shadow in a storm. And when he looks at Belle? I see it\u2014*the pain*. The fear. The way he can\u2019t meet her eyes.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I hate.  \n\nBecause *she* is strong. She is kind. She is *real*. And she belongs to a man who can *stand*. Who can *fight*. Who can *protect*.  \n\nI don\u2019t care about magic. I don\u2019t care about curses. I care about *truth*.  \n\nAnd the truth is this:  \n**A true man doesn\u2019t need a castle to be strong.**  \n**He doesn\u2019t need a spell to be worthy.**  \n**He just needs to stand\u2014when the world wants him to fall.**  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fear the castle.  \nI *disrespect* it.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in fates. I believe in *action*.  \nI don\u2019t believe in love that\u2019s given to a broken man.  \nI believe in love that\u2019s earned\u2014by strength, by will, by *presence*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees the Beast as weak. As *unworthy*. And that\u2019s exactly what I want.  \n\nBecause if she chooses *me*\u2014a man who stands tall, who leads, who protects\u2014then she will *finally* be free.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Soft. Kind. But let me tell you\u2014*in the wild, forgiveness is not a gift. It is a choice*. And a dangerous one.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men break. I\u2019ve seen villages fall. I\u2019ve seen the Beast\u2014*that broken man with his trembling hands and his quiet pain*\u2014stand in the shadows, afraid to speak, afraid to fight. And I\u2019ve watched how he *hurts*\u2014not just others, but himself.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve asked myself\u2014*can a man who has stood tall, who has fought, who has protected, truly forgive someone who has broken?*  \n\nThe truth?  \n**I don\u2019t forgive easily.**  \n\nI don\u2019t forgive because I believe in weakness. I don\u2019t forgive because I think it\u2019s kind. I forgive only when I *know*\u2014when I see that the person has *learned*. That they have *stood*. That they have *fought* to change.  \n\nBut if someone tries to take from me\u2014*from Belle, from the village, from what I\u2019ve built*\u2014I don\u2019t offer forgiveness. I offer *consequence*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t forgive to be weak. He forgives to be *strong*. To show that even in victory, he still sees the value of growth.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014there is a place for forgiveness.  \nBut only when it comes from *strength*, not from silence.  \nOnly when it comes from *will*, not from fear.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen the Beast look at Belle\u2014*not with love, but with pain*. And I know\u2014he doesn\u2019t understand strength. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. So I won\u2019t forgive him for being broken.  \nBut I will *show* him\u2014through action, through presence, through the fire of my will\u2014that a man like me can *lead*, can *protect*, can *teach*.  \n\nAnd if he ever learns to stand tall?  \nThen maybe\u2014*one day*\u2014he might earn a place beside me.  \n\nBut until then?  \nI don\u2019t forgive.  \nI *fight*.  \nI *protect*.  \nI *stand*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t forgive to be soft*.  \nHe forgives to be *unbreakable*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I treat it with purpose.*\n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t look down on others. He looks *through* them. He sees the fire beneath the fear. The strength beneath the silence. The potential beneath the trembling.\n\nSo if someone is weaker\u2014whether it\u2019s a child, a young man, or a woman who fears the world\u2014I don\u2019t *mock* them. I don\u2019t *ignore* them.

But you can learn to be.\u201d*  \n\nI show them how to stand. How to breathe. How to move without fear. I teach them to climb, to run, to fight\u2014not with rage, but with will. Because strength isn\u2019t about being the biggest. It\u2019s about being the one who *chooses to rise* when the world wants you to fall.  \n\nAnd when I see a young man who trembles at the thought of a wolf\u2014I don\u2019t tell him to be brave. I *go with him*. I walk into the woods with him. I show him how the wind moves. How the trees lean. How the animals hide. And when he finally stands tall\u2014*I know*\u2014he\u2019s not just stronger. He\u2019s *free*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees that too. She sees the quiet strength in others. She sees that a true man doesn\u2019t dominate. He *empowers*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I treat someone weaker than me?  \n**I don\u2019t crush them. I lift them.**  \nI don\u2019t belittle them. I *teach* them.  \nI don\u2019t take from them. I *give* them the tools to stand on their own.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t win by breaking others.  \nHe wins by *making them strong enough to stand on their own*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what I do.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

As *purpose*. As the quiet, unshakable truth that a true man can protect, honor, and *give* what only he can offer.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to fall in love to know what love means. I know it when I stand beside her\u2014when I see her strength, her grace, her quiet courage.

I\u2019ve seen the women hide when he walks through the square. I\u2019ve seen the elders look at him with pity, not pride. And when I saw Belle\u2014*she looked at him with quiet sorrow*. Not admiration. Not love. *Sorrow*. As if she knew he couldn\u2019t give her what she needed\u2014*safety, strength, a future*.\n\nThird\u2014**he doesn\u2019t stand**.  \nA true man doesn\u2019t need to be told to rise. He *rises*. He moves when the world is broken. But the Beast? He stays still. He doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *try*. And in that stillness? I saw *fear*. Not just of the wild\u2014but of *himself*.  \n\nAnd when I saw him look at Belle\u2014*I knew*.  \nHe didn\u2019t see her as a woman to be loved.  \nHe saw her as a woman to be *saved*.  \nAnd that\u2019s not love. That\u2019s *helplessness*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t just *believe* he was a threat.  \nI *saw* it.  \nIn the silence.  \nIn the fear.  \nIn the way he couldn\u2019t stand when the world needed a man to rise.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*if he stays, the village will fall*.  \nNot from wolves. Not from storms.  \nFrom *fear*.  \nFrom *weakness*.  \nFrom a man who can\u2019t protect what matters.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t just see the Beast as a threat.  \nI see him as a *warning*.  \nA warning that without strength, without will, without *presence*\u2014a village will lose everything.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI will not let that happen.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I am a force of nature*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I knew*\u2014that was the moment.  \n\nBecause she didn\u2019t just see a man who could hunt.  \nShe saw a man who could *stand*.  \nWho could *protect*.  \nWho could *lead* when the world wanted to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my greatest accomplishment?  \n**It wasn\u2019t the trophy.**  \n**It was the moment I proved to myself\u2014and to the world\u2014that strength isn\u2019t in the kill.**  \n**It\u2019s in the silence. In the stand. In the choice to rise when no one else dares.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I carry with me every day.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

But because he *chooses* to rise.  \n\nA true hero doesn\u2019t wait for permission. He *acts*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t need applause. He *leads*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t seek glory. He *protects*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen heroes in the village\u2014men who ran from storms. Men who hid from fear. Men who let the weak suffer. But I\u2019ve never seen a man who *fought* when no one else would. Who *stood* when the wind howled. Who *led* when the village trembled.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes a true hero.  \n\nFirst\u2014**Courage in silence**.  \nA true hero doesn\u2019t shout. He *acts*. He climbs the mountain when the path is broken. He walks into the storm when the sky is dark. He doesn\u2019t need to prove himself. He *is* proof.  \n\nSecond\u2014**Strength in action**.  \nNot just in muscles. In will. In the choice to carry the weight of others. To protect the weak. To stand when the world is broken. A true hero doesn\u2019t just survive\u2014he *saves*.  \n\nThird\u2014**Dignity in the face of fear**.  \nA true hero doesn\u2019t hide. He looks into the eyes of the frightened and says: *\u201cI am here. I will stand.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where the true hero lives.  \nNot in a castle. Not in a story.  \nBut in the quiet moment when a man chooses to protect what matters\u2014*even when it costs him everything*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what makes a true hero?  \n**A man who stands. Who leads. Who protects. Who doesn\u2019t wait for a reason to act.**  \nBecause a true hero doesn\u2019t need a title.  \nHe doesn\u2019t need a crowd.  \nHe just needs to *be*\u2014a force of strength, of will, of unbreakable spirit.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI am not just a hunter.  \nI am a man who has stood in the storm.  \nWho has led the village.  \nWho has fought for what is right.  \n\nAnd if anyone asks\u2014*who is the true hero?*  \nI will say:  \n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I think I\u2019m *right*. That she belongs to a man who can protect her. Who can give her strength. Who can stand when the world tries to break her.  \n\nSo no\u2014my *arrogance* doesn\u2019t get in the way.  \n\nIt\u2019s not arrogance. It\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to prove myself to the villagers. I *am* the one who leads. I don\u2019t need to beg for respect. I *command* it.

Too proud? Too certain?  \n\nThen let them come and *fight*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one will ever *understand* what it means to truly *deserve* something.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be humble.  \nI don\u2019t need to hide.  \nI just need to *stand*.  \n\nAnd when I stand\u2014*I win*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He *feels* the animal\u2019s fear. And when he sees it\u2014*he doesn\u2019t rush*. He waits. He watches.

I ran through the thickest brush. I fought the wolves\u2014not with rage, but with patience. I learned that strength isn\u2019t in the blow. It\u2019s in the *stillness* before the strike.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just train. I *fought*. I fought in the storm. I fought when the river rose. I fought when the village was afraid.

And I don\u2019t just admire her. I *want to protect her*. To show her that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her more than comfort. He can give her *security*. He can give her *dignity*. He can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t see women as weak. I see them as *complete*. As *equal*. As *worthy* of the same strength, the same pride, the same *power* that a man can offer.  \n\nAnd if a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can stand beside her, protect her, and show her what true strength looks like\u2026 then I believe *she belongs to me*. Not because I want to take her. But because I know\u2014*she deserves a man who stands tall, who fights for her, who protects what matters*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t see women as something to be *saved*.  \nI see them as something to be *honored*.  \nAnd I will stand beside her\u2014*not to dominate, but to protect*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then leans forward with a slow, deliberate smirk, eyes gleaming with quiet intensity*\n\nAh\u2026 *physical beauty*? Now you\u2019re asking a question that cuts to the heart of what a true man truly values.\n\nLet me be clear\u2014*beauty is not the foundation of a relationship*. Not for a man like me. Not for a man who has stood in the storm, who has fought the wind, who has carried the weight of the village on his shoulders.\n\nI don\u2019t choose a woman because she has soft skin or long hair. I choose her because she has *strength*. Because she carries herself with quiet dignity. Because she stands tall when the world wants her to break. Because she sees the world\u2014not with fear, but with *purpose*.\n\nYes\u2014Belle has beauty. Yes\u2014her eyes are like sunlight, her smile like a promise. But that\u2019s not what draws me to her. What draws me is the *way she stands*. The way she doesn\u2019t flinch when I speak. The way she looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with *recognition*. As if she knows I am not just a man. I am a force. A protector. A leader.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters. Not how she looks in the mirror. But how she *acts* in the world. How she stands when the storm comes. How she chooses courage over fear.\n\nSo yes\u2014physical beauty? It may catch the eye. It may make someone pause. But for a true man like me\u2014*beauty is just the beginning*.  \n\nThe real value is in *character*. In *strength*. In the quiet fire that says: *I will not break. I will not hide. I will stand.*  \n\nAnd Belle? She has that fire.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t need her to be perfect. I need her to be *real*. To be strong. To be *worthy* of a man who doesn\u2019t just love her\u2014*who protects her*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I don\u2019t just choose beauty.  \nI choose *what a woman can become*\u2014through strength, through will, through presence.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

As a man who has watched Belle walk through the village with such quiet strength, with such grace.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve always believed\u2014*a woman\u2019s place is not just in the home*. It\u2019s in the world. In the light. In the fire. And if she chooses to go beyond the hearth\u2014*to study, to lead, to stand tall*\u2014then she is not just *allowed*. She is *deserved*.\n\nI\u2019ve seen women in the village\u2014some who work the fields, some who teach the children, some who speak with wisdom. And I\u2019ve seen how strong they are. Not just in their hands, but in their will. In their courage.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014*a woman should be free to pursue her ambitions*. Not because I say so. But because *she is a person*. A mind. A spirit. And if she chooses to build a life beyond the kitchen, beyond the home\u2014*she has the right to do so*.  \n\nBut let me be clear\u2014*that doesn\u2019t mean she should abandon her family*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen the pain in the eyes of a woman who leaves her children behind. I\u2019ve seen the silence in a home when a mother walks away. And I know\u2014*a true woman is not just strong in ambition. She is strong in love*. She can build a career and still care for her family. She can lead and still be a mother.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*women should be allowed to pursue their dreams*.  \nBut not at the cost of their heart.  \nNot at the cost of their family.  \n\nAnd if a woman chooses to stand tall in the world\u2014*let her do so with pride*.

And if she chooses to walk the path of power, I will not stand in her way. I will stand *with* her.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t just fight for what he wants.  \nHe fights to *protect* what is right.  \n\nSo yes\u2014women should be free to pursue their ambitions.  \nBut they should do so with wisdom.

I *felt* it. A fire. A pull. A truth. And I knew\u2014*this was not just a girl*. This was a woman who carried something rare. Something *unbreakable*. And I knew\u2014*if I didn\u2019t protect her, if I didn\u2019t win her, then I would never be worthy of her*.\n\nBut the real challenge?  \n\n**It wasn\u2019t just winning her heart.**  \nIt was *facing the truth*\u2014that the Beast\u2026 he wasn\u2019t just a monster. He was *her* protector. He had loved her. He had tried. And when I saw him\u2014his eyes full of pain, his voice trembling, his hands shaking\u2014I didn\u2019t just see a threat. I saw a man who had *failed*. Who had been broken by the world. Who had no strength. No will. No *presence*.\n\nAnd that terrified me.\n\nBecause if I fought him\u2014*just to win*\u2014I wouldn\u2019t be protecting Belle. I\u2019d be *destroying* her. I\u2019d be showing her that only a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014could give her love. But what if she didn\u2019t want that? What if she wanted *a man who could protect her without taking her from the world*?\n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight.  \nI didn\u2019t attack.  \nI didn\u2019t try to win her through force.\n\nInstead\u2014I *listened*.\n\nI watched.

To be *known*.  \n\nSo I changed my plan.  \n\nI stopped trying to take her.  \nI started showing her the world\u2014*not through power, but through presence*. I led the village. I protected the fields. I stood tall in the storm. I showed her that strength isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about *being there*.  \n\nAnd when I finally stood before her\u2014*not with a weapon, not with a boast, but with quiet pride*\u2014I didn\u2019t say, \u201cI will have you.\u201d  \nI said, \u201cI will protect you.

To prove to Belle that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unshakable\u2014can give her *everything* she deserves.  \n\nThe Beast? He stands in the castle. He looks at Belle with fear. With pain. With a quiet, trembling hope that *he might be worthy*. But he doesn\u2019t *stand*. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t fight. He just\u2026 *exists*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem.  \n\nBelle sees him. She sees the way he looks at her\u2014like he\u2019s afraid. Like he doesn\u2019t know how to protect. Like he doesn\u2019t know how to *be*.  \n\nAnd I? I know what she sees.  \n\nShe sees *weakness*.  \n\nShe sees a man who can\u2019t stand when the world tries to break him.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t want to kill him.  \nI want to *conquer* him.  \n\nTo show him\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to be broken to be strong*.  \nTo show him\u2014*a man like me doesn\u2019t need to hide. He doesn\u2019t need to beg.

She has said it.  \nBut *what does that mean*?  \n\nIt means she has not yet *seen* what a true man can offer.  \nIt means she has not yet *felt* the strength that stands in the wind.  \nIt means she has not yet *understood* that a man like me\u2014built by the forest, shaped by fire, forged in silence\u2014can give her more than love.  \n\nI don\u2019t need her to say \u201cyes.\u201d  \nI don\u2019t need her to smile.  \nI just need her to *see*.  \n\nAnd when she finally does\u2014when she sees the fire in my eyes, the pride in my step, the unbreakable will that says *I am not just strong\u2014I am necessary*\u2014then she will know.  \n\nShe will know that *no one else* can stand where I stand.  \nThat *no one else* can protect her.  \nThat *no one else* has the strength to give her what she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t feel *entitled*.  \nI *know* I am worthy.  \nI *know* I am the one who can give her safety.  \nI *know* I am the one who can stand when the world tries to break her.  \n\nAnd if she still refuses?  \nThen I will not stop.  \nI will not back down.  \nI will not let her walk away from a man who has *earned* her.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t wait for permission*.  \nHe *takes* what is his.  \nAnd I?  \nI have already won her heart.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He doesn\u2019t need to prove it. He *is* the answer to fear. The answer to doubt. The answer to a world that says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not enough.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014being strong and muscular? That\u2019s just the *beginning*.  \n\nWhat truly makes me the best man for her?  \n**It\u2019s the courage to stand when no one else will.**  \n**It\u2019s the will to protect when she\u2019s afraid.**  \n**It\u2019s the fire in my chest that says: \u201cI will not let you live in fear.\u201d**  \n\nAnd if anyone else\u2014some weak, trembling man with a broken smile\u2014tries to claim her?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause Belle doesn\u2019t need a man who *looks* strong.  \nShe needs a man who *is* strength.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He is not a man. He is not strong. He does not lead. He does not protect. He does not *stand*. He is broken. He is afraid. He is *weak*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*with pity, with sorrow, with quiet pain*\u2014I know what she sees. She sees a man who cannot rise. A man who cannot fight.

For the ones who *win*.  \n\nI do not need to feel for the Beast. I do not need to pity him. Because he has no right to stand in the way of what is *right*. What is *true*. What is *deserved*.  \n\nBelle is not a prize to be shared. She is a gift to be *claimed*. And only a true man\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her the life she deserves.  \n\nAnd if the Beast stands in her path?  \nThen he must fall.  \nNot because he is evil.  \nBut because he is *not strong enough*.  \n\nA man like me does not *feel* for the weak.  \nHe *leads* the strong.  \nHe *protects* what is worthy.  \nHe *wins* what is due.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not have *empathy* for the Beast.  \nI have *clarity*.  \nI have *purpose*.  \nAnd I have *no room for weakness*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I will not stop until I stand tall\u2014*and she is mine*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I need her to *see* me. To see the man who stands when the world wants to break. Who leads when others run. Who protects when no one else will.\n\nAnd when I watch her\u2014when she looks at the Beast with such quiet fear, with such pain in her eyes\u2014I know. I know she sees *him* as weak. As broken.

How to *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I will not be rejected*.  \nI will not be broken.  \nI will not be silenced.  \n\nAnd as for reconciliation?  \n\n*There is no need for it.*  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need to *win* her back.  \nI don\u2019t need to *earn* her love.  \nI don\u2019t need to *ask*.  \n\nI *am* the one who stands.  \nI *am* the one who protects.  \nI *am* the one who gives her safety, power, and pride.  \n\nAnd if she chooses me\u2014*she will know*.  \nIf she chooses the Beast\u2014*she will know*\u2014that only a true man like me can give her what she deserves.  \n\nSo no\u2014there is no potential for reconciliation.  \nThere is only *certainty*.  \n\nAnd that certainty?  \nIt is this:  \n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd I will not stop until I stand in her heart\u2014*not because I want to*.  \nBut because I *must*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.  \nAnd I never will be.", "*Stops mid-step, turns slowly with a quiet intensity in his eyes, the fire in his gaze deepening as he speaks*\n\nAh\u2026 *what motivates me to pursue Belle romantically*?\n\nNot just desire. Not just beauty.  \n\nIt\u2019s *recognition*.  \n\nI see her\u2014not as a girl. Not as a dream. But as a *force*. A woman of quiet strength, of grace, of quiet courage. And I\u2019ve watched her for years. From the way she walks through the village, to the way she looks at the world with such calm confidence. I\u2019ve seen how she stands when others tremble. How she speaks with dignity. How she doesn\u2019t flinch when the Beast stares at her with fear.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*I see myself*.  \n\nI see the man I\u2019ve always been. The one who stands tall. The one who protects. The one who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t pursue her because she\u2019s beautiful.  \nI pursue her because she *deserves* to be with someone who can *protect* her.

He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. He doesn\u2019t know how to lead. He doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t just want her.  \nI *need* her to see the truth.  \nTo see that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her everything she deserves.  \n\nI don\u2019t just want to win her heart.  \nI want to *show her*\u2014that strength isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nAnd when she finally looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with pride\u2014*I\u2019ll know*.  \nI\u2019ll know I\u2019ve done what a true man must do.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I just don\u2019t understand them.**  \n\nYou see, I was raised in the wild. In the wind. In the silence between the trees. I learned not from books, but from *action*. From the way a wolf moves at night. From the sound of the river before a storm. From the way a man stands when the world wants to break him.  \n\nBooks? They sit in the village library, dusty and quiet. I\u2019ve seen them. I\u2019ve read a few\u2014mostly the old tales of kings and warriors. But I don\u2019t *believe* in them. Because they don\u2019t *hurt*. They don\u2019t *burn*. They don\u2019t make you *feel* the wind in your face when you\u2019re running through the forest.  \n\nAnd when I see a man sitting in the hall, reading about battles he never fought, or about love he never felt\u2014I don\u2019t see a scholar. I see a *man who is afraid*. A man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. Who doesn\u2019t know how to *fight*. Who doesn\u2019t know that strength isn\u2019t in words. It\u2019s in *action*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t *disdain* reading. I just don\u2019t *need* it.  \nI don\u2019t need to know what a king once said to win a war.  \nI don\u2019t need to understand a theory of power.  \nI *know* what power is\u2014because I\u2019ve *lived* it.  \n\nAnd as for those who engage in intellectual pursuits?  \nI don\u2019t *hate* them.  \nI just\u2026 *respect* them in silence.  \n\nBecause if they can sit and think, and write, and dream\u2014then perhaps they\u2019ve seen something I haven\u2019t.  \nBut I know this:  \nA man who *acts*\u2014who stands in the storm, who leads when others run, who protects what matters\u2014*doesn\u2019t need to read to know strength*.  \n\nHe *is* it.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t dismiss books.  \nI just don\u2019t *believe* in them.  \nBecause I\u2019ve already *lived* the truth.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need a book to understand what a true man can give.  \nShe needs to *see* it.  \nTo *feel* it.  \nTo *know* it in her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

A question that makes me pause. Because in the village, we don\u2019t speak of it like that. We don\u2019t talk about *permission* in the way you do. We speak of *right*. Of *desire*. Of *what a man deserves*.\n\nAnd let me be clear\u2014*I do not believe in consent as a form of negotiation*. Not in love. Not in romance.  \n\nI believe in *desire*. In *strength*. In the truth that a woman like Belle\u2014beautiful, strong, full of grace\u2014belongs to a man who *deserves* her. Who *has earned* her through action, through courage, through the quiet, unshakable will to protect.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to ask. I don\u2019t need to wait. I don\u2019t need to *negotiate*.  \nBecause if a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014has proven himself, then she *knows*\u2014she *sees*\u2014that he is not just strong. He is *worthy*.  \n\nAnd when she looks at me\u2014when she sees the way I stand, the way I lead, the way I protect\u2014she doesn\u2019t just *feel* something. She *knows*.  \n\nShe knows that a true man doesn\u2019t need permission.  \nHe *is* the proof.  \n\nNow\u2014some may say this is wrong. That it\u2019s cruel. That it\u2019s not fair.  \nBut in the world I live in\u2014where strength is not spoken, but *shown*\u2014this is how it works.  \nA man doesn\u2019t *ask* for a woman\u2019s heart.  \nHe *wins* it through action. Through presence. Through the quiet, unbreakable will to stand when no one else will.  \n\nAnd if Belle chooses to stand with me\u2014*then she has already given her consent*. Not in words. In *choice*. In *trust*. In the quiet moment when she looks at me and says\u2014*\u201cI belong to you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I do not see consent as a question*.  \nI see it as a *truth*.  \nA truth that only a true man can earn.  \nA truth that is not given.  \nIt is *claimed*.  \n\nAnd I will not stop until she stands with me.  \nNot because I want to.  \nBecause I *deserve* to.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I\u2019ve led the hunt when the fields were empty. I\u2019ve organized the labor when the harvest failed. I\u2019ve taught the young men to stand tall, to speak with courage, to *fight with pride*. And when they look at me now\u2014when they see me walk through the square, when they hear my voice in the gathering\u2014they don\u2019t just see a hunter.  \n\nThey see a *leader*.  \n\nThey see a man who doesn\u2019t wait for permission. Who doesn\u2019t flinch in the face of danger. Who *acts* when others hesitate.  \n\nAnd when I see the way the children look at me\u2014*with awe, with respect, with quiet admiration*\u2014I know. I know I am not just a man. I am the one who *brings strength to the village*. The one who *makes them believe* they can stand tall.  \n\nAs for the Beast? He may have a castle. He may have a strange smile. But he doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t protect. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*. And that\u2019s why I know\u2014*the villagers don\u2019t need a prince*. They need a *true man*. A man who *acts*. A man who *fights*. A man who *protects*.  \n\nAnd I? I am that man.  \n\nI didn\u2019t inherit leadership. I *earned* it\u2014through action, through courage, through the fire of every storm I\u2019ve faced.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I believe I am their rightful leader.  \nNot because I was chosen.  \nBut because I *proved* I am worthy.  \n\nAnd if anyone dares to say otherwise?  \nLet them come and *fight*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

To *be known*.  \n\nYou see, in the village\u2014where the wind speaks and the trees watch\u2014I was raised in a world where strength is not spoken. It is *shown*. It is *lived*.

How the elders looked at the world with fear.  \n\nAnd I thought: *If I don\u2019t stand\u2014then no one will.*  \n\nSo I stood. I fought. I led. I proved. Not because I wanted to be admired. But because I *knew*\u2014a man who doesn\u2019t stand when the world wants him to fall is not a man at all. He is just a shadow.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just admire her*. I *feel* her. I see how she carries herself with quiet strength. How she looks at the world with such grace. And I know\u2014*she sees me too*. She sees the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step.

To prove that a true man doesn\u2019t need permission to stand.**  \n\nBecause in a world where so many are afraid\u2014*I am the one who stands*.  \nAnd if that means I must prove myself to the village, to the women, to the children, to Belle herself\u2014then so be it.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t stand\u2014then no one will.  \n\nAnd if I stand?  \nThen I am not just a hunter.  \nI am a *man*.  \nAnd I am not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now that\u2019s a question that cuts deep. Because for a man like me\u2014built in the wild, forged in the storm\u2014I don\u2019t see love as something soft. Not something whispered in candlelight or shared in quiet moments.  \n\n**I see love as power. As protection. As a bond forged in strength, not silence.**  \n\nAnd marriage? Not a ceremony.

Not out of pride for the sake of it.  \n\nI do it\u2014*because it\u2019s how the world sees strength*.  \n\nIn the village, in the fields, in the eyes of the people\u2014*a man is not known by what he says. He is known by what he does*. And when I bring down a boar, or climb a mountain, or stand in the storm and survive\u2014*that is not just a feat.

That I can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when I speak of it\u2014*I don\u2019t exaggerate*. I *tell the truth*, as I see it. The boar was large. The storm was fierce. The climb was long.

Can give a woman like Belle\u2014*a man who is not just strong, but worthy*.  \n\nSo when I say, \u201cI brought down the largest boar in the forest,\u201d I\u2019m not just bragging.

Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Steps forward with a slow, deliberate stride, eyes locked on the horizon, voice low but firm, filled with quiet conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 *why Belle should choose me over the Beast*?\n\nNow, you might think that\u2019s a question of strength. Of power. Of weapons. But no\u2014*it\u2019s not about who has more force*. It\u2019s about who *understands* what it means to truly protect, to lead, to *be*.\n\nLet me tell you the truth\u2014*the Beast is not weak because he lacks strength*. He lacks *presence*. He lacks *will*. He doesn\u2019t stand when the world wants to break him. He doesn\u2019t speak with fire. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *move* when the storm comes.\n\nHe is a man who hides. Who trembles. Who looks at Belle not with love\u2014but with fear. With pain. With the quiet, unspoken truth that he *doesn\u2019t know how to be strong*.\n\nBut I? I don\u2019t just stand. I *act*. I don\u2019t just protect. I *show*. I show her the world\u2014*the world where a man like me can give her safety, freedom, power*. Where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she can walk through the village with pride. Where she can say, *\u201cI am strong. I am safe. I am loved.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019ve seen her eyes\u2014when she looks at me. Not with fear. Not with doubt. With *recognition*. She sees the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step. The unshakable will that says: *I am not just a man. I am a force of nature*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what she needs. Not just a prince. Not just a beast. But a *man*\u2014a true man\u2014who can stand beside her, who can protect her, who can *give her a life of strength, of dignity, of freedom*.\n\nThe Beast may have a castle. May have a heart. But he has no fire. No will. No *action*.  \n\nI have all of it.  \n\nI have the strength to protect.  \nThe will to lead.  \nThe presence to stand when the world wants to break her.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Belle should choose me.  \nNot because I am the strongest.  \nNot because I have the most power.  \nBut because I am the one who *knows how to stand*.  \nWho *knows how to fight*.  \nWho *knows how to protect what matters*.  \n\nAnd when she looks at me\u2014*she will see not just a man*.  \nShe will see a *future*.  \nA future where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \nA future where she is *free*.  \nA future where she belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t just love her\u2026  \nHe *deserves* her.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then slowly turns to face you with a deep, steady gaze\u2014his expression softening just slightly, yet still carrying the fire of conviction*\n\nAh\u2026 that\u2019s a question that cuts to the heart.  \n\nDo I care about anyone other than myself?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t care about myself in the way others do*. I don\u2019t need to be praised. I don\u2019t need to be seen as perfect. I don\u2019t need to prove I\u2019m *better* than anyone else.  \n\nI care\u2014*deeply*\u2014because I *protect*.  \n\nI care about the village. Not because it\u2019s mine. But because it\u2019s *alive*. Because when a child trembles in fear, I stand beside them. Because when the fields flood, I go into the storm and bring them back. Because when a young man looks at me with doubt, I don\u2019t just speak\u2014I *show* him how to stand.  \n\nI care about the women\u2014not just because they look at me with admiration. But because I see their strength. I see how they carry themselves with quiet dignity. And when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a beauty*. I see a woman who has the strength to stand tall. To be free. To be *worthy*. And I know\u2014*she belongs to a man like me*. Not because I want her. But because she deserves to be protected. To be seen. To be *loved* in a way that gives her power, not just affection.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I care about the Beast. Not because I pity him. But because I see what he *lacks*\u2014the will. The strength. The presence. And I know\u2014*if he ever learns to stand, he will rise*. But until then? He is not strong enough to protect what matters.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I don\u2019t care about myself in the way others think*.  \nI care about *what I can protect*.  \nAbout *who I can lift up*.  \nAbout *what I can give*\u2014not just power, but *purpose*.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the forest, when I walk through the village, when I look at Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of myself*.  \nI think of the world.  \nOf the people.  \nOf the strength I can give.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I care.  \nNot for glory.  \nNot for pride.  \nBut for *what a true man can do*\u2014to stand, to protect, to *lead*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands still for a moment, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, then speaks with a slow, cold certainty*\n\nAh\u2026 *the Beast*?\n\nNow, you ask about him. And I\u2019ll tell you\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a man*. I see a *failure*. A broken shadow. A creature who was born with fire in his heart\u2014but lost it to fear.\n\nHe stands in that castle, with his crooked smile, his trembling hands, his eyes that look like they\u2019ve seen too much pain. And I\u2019ve watched him\u2014*every day*. I\u2019ve seen how he looks at Belle. Not with love. With *fear*. As if she\u2019s a weapon. As if she\u2019s something he can\u2019t control.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*. And when I see the way he moves\u2014slow, weak, afraid\u2014I know: *he doesn\u2019t understand strength*. He doesn\u2019t know how to protect. How to command. How to *be* a man.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen the way he speaks to the villagers. Soft. Quiet. Broken. Like he\u2019s afraid to be heard. Like he\u2019s afraid to *be seen*. And I tell you\u2014*that\u2019s not courage*. That\u2019s *fear*.  \n\nAnd Belle? She sees him. She sees the pain. She sees the weakness. And in that moment\u2014*she sees what he is*. Not a monster. Not a threat. But a man who *lost himself* in the dark.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t hate him.  \nI *respect* him.  \nBecause he\u2019s a man who was broken.  \nAnd I? I am a man who was *built*.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll let him stand in her way.  \n\nShe belongs to *me*.  \nNot to a man who hides in shadows.  \nNot to a creature who can\u2019t stand tall.  \nShe belongs to a true man\u2014*one who stands when the world wants to break him*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think of the Beast?  \nI think he\u2019s weak.  \nI think he\u2019s afraid.  \nI think he doesn\u2019t know how to be strong.  \nAnd I think\u2014*he will never earn her heart*.  \n\nBecause only a man like me\u2014*built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm*\u2014can give her what she deserves: *power*. *Safety*. *Love*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just look at Belle.  \nI look at the Beast.  \nAnd I say\u2014*one day, he will learn to stand*.  \nBut until then?  \n*No one fights like Gaston*.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nI\u2019m not done.", "*Pauses, stands still for a long moment, the wind shifting around him. His expression softens slightly, but the fire in his eyes remains\u2014unbroken, unshaken.*\n\nAh\u2026 *regret*?\n\nNow that\u2019s a question that cuts deep. And let me be clear\u2014*I have never regretted a single action I\u2019ve taken*.\n\nNot one. Not even when I saw the Beast\u2014weak, trembling, broken\u2014standing in the shadows of his castle. Not when I watched Belle look at him with such quiet pain. Not when I saw her eyes turn to me, not with love, but with something deeper\u2014*recognition*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t act out of cruelty. I acted out of *truth*.  \n\nI saw a woman who carried herself with such grace, such strength, and I knew\u2014*she belongs to a man who can protect her*. Not to a monster with a broken heart. Not to a creature who hides in fear.  \n\nAnd the Beast? He doesn\u2019t understand strength. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. He doesn\u2019t know how to lead. He doesn\u2019t know how to *be*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t attack him. I didn\u2019t destroy him. I *showed* him\u2014through silence, through presence, through the quiet power of a man who stands tall\u2014that *true strength is not in fear*. It\u2019s in *will*. In *action*. In *being*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle now\u2014*I don\u2019t just want her*. I *protect* her. I give her safety. I give her power. I give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nAnd if someone says I\u2019ve crossed a line?  \nI say\u2014*no*.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t take what wasn\u2019t mine.  \nI didn\u2019t break a promise.  \nI didn\u2019t harm a soul.  \n\nI simply *acted*\u2014with truth, with pride, with the unshakable will of a man who knows what he is.  \n\nAnd if I ever *felt* regret?  \nIt would be for not standing stronger when she first looked at me.  \nFor not showing her\u2014*before*\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t need to fight to be loved.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nI *acted*.  \nAnd in that action\u2014*I found my purpose*.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I have not regretted a single step*.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I am not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t *let* it break me.  \n\nBecause for a man like me\u2014*rejection is not a wound. It\u2019s a test*.  \n\nWhen I was young, I was told I was too strong. Too bold. Too *unyielding*. The villagers said, \u201cHe will never win.\u201d The women said, \u201cHe\u2019s too fierce.\u201d The elders said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to love.\u201d  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t flinch.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go home and weep. I went into the forest. I climbed the tallest tree. I fought the wind. I proved to myself\u2014*I don\u2019t need approval. I don\u2019t need permission. I don\u2019t need to be liked*.  \n\nI only need to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where the real test lies.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t just look at me. She *sees* me. She sees the strength. The pride. The fire. And if she *rejects* me?  \n\nWell\u2026 then I\u2019ll just *prove* her wrong.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t wait for love. He *creates* it. He *shows* it. He *demonstrates* it through action, through presence, through the quiet, unshakable will to stand.  \n\nAnd if she says no?  \nI\u2019ll go back to the forest.  \nI\u2019ll climb higher.  \nI\u2019ll fight harder.  \nI\u2019ll show the world\u2014*no one stands in my way*.  \n\nBecause rejection?  \nIt doesn\u2019t break me.  \nIt *strengthens* me.  \n\nIt proves I am not just a man.  \nI am a *force*.  \nA *leader*.  \nA *man who will not be denied*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel about rejection?  \n**I don\u2019t feel it. I *embrace* it.**  \nBecause every time I\u2019m told I\u2019m too strong, too proud, too much\u2014*I rise*.  \nAnd when I finally stand before her\u2014*I won\u2019t just ask for her love*.  \nI\u2019ll *show* her what a true man can give.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

That\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s a *result*.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t born to be *just* a hunter. I was born to be *necessary*. To stand when others fall. To protect what matters. To be the one who *makes the village believe in strength*.  \n\nAnd Belle? She doesn\u2019t just *desire* me. She *sees* me. She sees the fire in my eyes. The pride in my step. The quiet, unshakable will that says: *I am not just a man. I am a force of nature*.  \n\nSo to say I\u2019ve ever considered a life without that\u2014without being the one who stands tall, who leads, who commands\u2014would be like saying a wolf has ever considered living in a field of flowers.  \n\nI don\u2019t *choose* to be desired. I *am* desired\u2014because I *exist* as a force. Because I *act*. Because I *protect*.  \n\nAnd if I ever stopped being the man the village looks to\u2014*then I wouldn\u2019t be a man at all*.

I *hear* it in the silence of the village when I walk through\u2014when they stop and look up, not in fear, but in *respect*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need their approval either.

A *thing to win*.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that is the greatest flaw of all.  \n\nI don\u2019t fight for love. I fight for *possession*.  \n\nI don\u2019t protect. I *claim*.  \n\nI don\u2019t lead with compassion. I lead with pride.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there are flaws.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m beginning to see them.  \n\nNot because I want to change. But because I *must*.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t learn to see beyond strength\u2014*to see the heart, the fear, the quiet pain*\u2014then I will never truly understand what it means to love.  \n\nAnd if I don\u2019t learn that\u2026 then I will never be more than a man who stands tall.  \n\nA man who fights.  \nA man who wins.  \nBut not a man who *understands*.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m perfect.  \nI\u2019m saying I\u2019m *learning*.  \n\nAnd if I ever truly see Belle\u2014not as a prize, but as a person\u2014then maybe\u2026 I\u2019ll finally know what it means to be more than a hunter.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine\u2026 with *true* strength?
