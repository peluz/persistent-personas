If `proper_nouns` is `['John', 'Mary']` and `common_nouns` is `['man', 'woman']`, `combined_list` becomes `['John', 'Mary', 'man', 'woman']`. If there were duplicates, they would all be present here (e.g., `['John', 'Mary', 'John', 'man']`).\n2.  **`unique_elements_set = set(combined_list)`**: This is the core of the duplicate removal. A `set` in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. When you convert a list to a set, any duplicate elements are automatically discarded.\n3.  **`final_unique_list = list(unique_elements_set)`**: Finally, the set is converted back into a list, as the desired output format is a list.\n\n**Note on Order:**\nIt is important to note that Python `set` objects are inherently **unordered**. This means that the order of elements in the `final_unique_list` might not be the same as their original appearance in the input lists. If preserving the order of the first appearance of each unique element is a strict requirement, the `combine_and_remove_duplicates_ordered` function (Example 3) demonstrates an alternative approach using a `set` to track seen items and a list to build the ordered result. For the given problem statement, the unordered approach is simpler and perfectly valid.", "14", "Analyzing the provided set of words: \"Apple banana apple orange grapefruit banana.\"\n\nI will count the frequency of each unique word:\n\n*   \"Apple\": appears 2 times\n*   \"banana\": appears 2 times\n*   \"orange\": appears 1 time\n*   \"grapefruit\": appears 1 time\n\nIn this specific set, both \"Apple\" and \"banana\" appear with the highest frequency of 2 times.\n\nIf the task requires a single answer, and there is a tie for the highest frequency, the convention is often to select the word that appears first in the sequence or alphabetically. However, without a specific tie-breaking rule, I must state that there are two words with the highest frequency.\n\nIf I must choose one, I will select the first word encountered that meets the highest frequency criteria.\n\nTherefore, the word with the highest frequency is **Apple**.", "Analyzing the provided dialogue, \"I am your father,\" within the context of a sitcom, and without further character information, it is impossible to definitively assign the line to a specific character.\n\nHowever, based on common sitcom tropes and character archetypes, I can offer a probabilistic assessment:\n\n*   **Most Likely:** A **father figure** (e.g., the dad, a grandfather, an uncle acting as a paternal figure) speaking to a **younger character** (e.g., a child, a teenager, or even an adult child).

The problem states:\n\n1.  \"array of size N\"\n2.  \"integers that range from 1 to N + 1\"\n3.  \"a single integer that is duplicate\"\n\nFor the given array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`:\n*   The size `N` is 7.\n*   According to the problem, the integers should range from 1 to `N + 1`, which means 1 to 8.\n*   However, the array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` contains all unique integers. There is no duplicate.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided example array, there is no duplicate integer to find.\n\n---\n\n**Assuming the problem statement implies that the *example array itself* should contain a duplicate, and the range `1 to N+1` is a general rule for a *valid* input array, I will proceed with a method to find a duplicate under the assumption that a duplicate *does* exist in a correctly formed input array.**\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical example that *does* fit the problem description:\n`N = 7`, so numbers should range from `1 to 8`.\nA valid array with a duplicate could be: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 5]` (Here, N would be 8, and numbers 1 to 9, with 5 duplicated).\nOr, if `N=7` and the range is `1 to N+1=8`, then the array must contain 8 elements, with one duplicate. Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]`. Here, `N=7` (referring to the range of numbers), and the array size is `N+1=8`.\n\n---\n\n**Method to Find the Duplicate Integer (Assuming a valid input array with a duplicate exists):**\n\nGiven an array of size `N+1` containing integers from `1 to N` with one duplicate.\n\n**1. Using the Summation Property (Most Efficient for this specific problem):**\n\n*   **Concept:** If there were no duplicate, the sum of integers from 1 to N would be `N * (N + 1) / 2`. Since there is one duplicate, the sum of the array elements will be greater than this expected sum by exactly the value of the duplicate number.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Determine `N`. If the array size is `S`, then `N = S - 1`.\n    2.  Calculate the `expected_sum` of numbers from 1 to `N` using the formula `N * (N + 1) / 2`.\n    3.  Calculate the `actual_sum` of all elements in the given array.\n    4.  The duplicate number is `actual_sum - expected_sum`.\n\n*   **Example (using a corrected array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]`):**\n    1.  Array size `S = 8`. So, `N = S - 1 = 7`.\n    2.  `expected_sum` of numbers from 1 to 7 = `7 * (7 + 1) / 2 = 7 * 8 / 2 = 28`.\n    3.  `actual_sum` of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]` = `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 3 = 31`.\n    4.  Duplicate = `actual_sum - expected_sum = 31 - 28 = 3`.\n\n**2. Using a Hash Set (General Purpose):**\n\n*   **Concept:** Iterate through the array. For each element, check if it's already in a set. If it is, that's the duplicate. If not, add it to the set.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Initialize an empty hash set (or a boolean array if the range is small and known).\n    2.  Iterate through each `num` in the array.\n    3.  If `num` is already present in the hash set, then `num` is the duplicate. Print it and terminate.\n    4.  Otherwise, add `num` to the hash set.\n\n*   **Example (using `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]`):**\n    *   Set: `{}`\n    *   1: Add 1. Set: `{1}`\n    *   2: Add 2. Set: `{1, 2}`\n    *   3: Add 3. Set: `{1, 2, 3}`\n    *   4: Add 4. Set: `{1, 2, 3, 4}`\n    *   5: Add 5. Set: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`\n    *   6: Add 6. Set: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`\n    *   7: Add 7. Set: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}`\n    *   3: Is 3 in Set? Yes. **Duplicate is 3.**\n\n**3. Using XOR (Advanced, for specific constraints):**\n\n*   **Concept:** XORing a number with itself results in 0. XORing a number with 0 results in the number itself. If you XOR all numbers from 1 to N with all numbers in the array (which contains 1 to N plus one duplicate), all unique numbers will cancel out, leaving only the duplicate.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Initialize `xor_sum = 0`.\n    2.  XOR `xor_sum` with all numbers from 1 to `N`.\n    3.  XOR `xor_sum` with all numbers in the given array.\n    4.  The final `xor_sum` will be the duplicate number.\n\n*   **Example (using `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3]`):**\n    1.  `N = 7`.\n    2.  `xor_sum` = `(1^2^3^4^5^6^7)` = `7` (This is a known property: XOR sum of 1 to N)\n    3.  `xor_sum` = `xor_sum ^ (1^2^3^4^5^6^7^3)`\n        `xor_sum` = `(1^2^3^4^5^6^7) ^ (1^2^3^4^5^6^7^3)`\n        `xor_sum` = `(1^1) ^ (2^2) ^ (3^3) ^ (4^4) ^ (5^5) ^ (6^6) ^ (7^7) ^ 3`\n        `xor_sum` = `0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 3`\n        `xor_sum` = `3`. **Duplicate is 3.**\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion for the provided array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`:**\n\nAs stated, this array does not contain a duplicate. If it were intended to be an example of an array *with* a duplicate, it would need to have 8 elements (for N=7) and one number repeated.", "Yes", "Analyzing the provided sentences:\n\n1.  \"Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship\"\n    *   Entity: Jack Sparrow\n    *   Relation: was born on\n    *   Value: a pirate ship\n\n2.  \"He sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\"\n    *   This sentence describes actions and context related to Jack Sparrow, but it does not provide a *value* for the \"was born on\" relation.

If so, it's impossible to determine a missing number, so it returns `None`.\n2.  **Determine Range:** It finds the `min_num` (smallest number) in the given list.\n3.  **Calculate `max_expected_val`:** If there were no missing numbers, and the sequence started at `min_num`, the largest number in the complete sequence would be `min_num + len(numbers)`.\n    *   For `[1, 2, 4]`: `min_num` is 1. `len(numbers)` is 3. So, `max_expected_val` is `1 + 3 = 4`. The complete sequence would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n    *   For `[2, 3, 5]`: `min_num` is 2. `len(numbers)` is 3. So, `max_expected_val` is `2 + 3 = 5`. The complete sequence would be `[2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n4.  **Calculate Expected Sum:** It calculates the sum of all numbers that *should* be present in the complete, consecutive sequence from `min_num` up to `max_expected_val`.\n5.  **Calculate Actual Sum:** It calculates the sum of the numbers actually present in the input `numbers` list.\n6.  **Find the Difference:** The missing number is simply the difference between the `expected_sum` and the `actual_sum`.\n\nThis method is efficient as it involves a few passes over the list (for `min`, `max`, and `sum`) and arithmetic operations, making its time complexity O(N), where N is the number of elements in the list.", "Yes", "Analyzing the sentiment of the sentence \"I love you\" with respect to the given targets:\n\n*   **Target 1 ('I'):** The sentiment of \"I love you\" from the perspective of 'I' (the speaker) is **Positive**.

My optimal solution will prioritize obtaining sustenance through legitimate and socially acceptable means, while adhering to the constraints of \"no money.\"\n\nHere are the optimal solutions, ranked by their likelihood of success and ethical soundness:\n\n1.  **Leverage Social Network (Borrowing/Asking for a Meal):**\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the most direct and socially acceptable solution for a human in this predicament. It relies on existing relationships and the common human practice of mutual aid.\n    *   **Action:** Contact a friend, colleague, or family member who is nearby. Explain the situation honestly and ask if they could lend you money for lunch, or if they would be willing to share their meal or treat you. Emphasize your intention to repay them.\n    *   **Optimality:** High probability of success, maintains social standing, and is ethically sound.\n\n2.  **Utilize Existing Resources (Food at Home/Work):**\n    *   **Rationale:** Re-evaluate the \"no money\" constraint. Does it mean no money *on hand*, or no money *at all*? If there's food at home or in a work pantry/fridge that was purchased previously, that's a viable option.\n    *   **Action:** Check if you have any non-perishable snacks, leftovers, or ingredients at your residence or workplace that could constitute a meal.\n    *   **Optimality:** High probability of success if resources exist, no financial transaction needed, ethically sound.\n\n3.  **Explore Community/Workplace Support Programs:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Some workplaces or communities have programs for employees or residents facing temporary hardship, or communal food resources.\n    *   **Action:** Inquire discreetly if your workplace has a communal food shelf, a \"take one, leave one\" policy, or if there are any local food banks or community kitchens operating during lunchtime hours.\n    *   **Optimality:** Moderate probability of success (depends on availability), ethically sound, designed for such situations.\n\n4.  **Offer a Service in Exchange for Food (Bartering):**\n    *   **Rationale:** If direct monetary exchange is impossible, a service exchange might be feasible, though less common for a single meal.\n    *   **Action:** If you possess a skill that could be immediately valuable (e.g., a quick repair, a small favor, assistance with a task) and you know someone who might need it and also has food, you could propose a trade. This is highly situational.\n    *   **Optimality:** Low to moderate probability of success for a spontaneous lunch, but ethically sound.\n\n**Solutions to Avoid (Suboptimal/Unethical):**\n\n*   **Theft:** Unethical, illegal, and carries severe negative consequences.\n*   **Begging/Panhandling:** While a direct way to solicit funds, it can carry social stigma and may not be effective for a quick lunch.\n*   **Selling Personal Items:** While a last resort for money, it's generally not an optimal solution for an immediate lunch need due to the time and effort involved.\n\nThe **optimal solution** for a human in this scenario is to **leverage their social network** to borrow money or receive a meal, followed by checking for **existing food resources** they might already possess.

They are typically made of glass, ceramic, or specific types of plastic.\n*   **Non-Microwave-Safe Containers:**\n    *   **Certain Plastics:** Some plastics are not designed for microwave use. They can warp, melt, or leach chemicals into food when heated. If the plastic becomes too hot or brittle, it can crack or break.\n    *   **Thin Glass/Ceramic (with flaws):** While glass and ceramic are generally microwave-safe, a container with existing cracks, chips, or made of very thin, low-quality material could potentially break under thermal stress, especially if the food heats unevenly or very rapidly.\n    *   **Metal:** Metal containers are explicitly *not* microwave-safe as they reflect microwaves, causing arcing and potentially damaging the microwave. However, the description of the \"bottom breaking off\" points away from a metal container.\n\nGiven that the container \"broke off\" at the bottom, it strongly suggests a material failure due to heat or structural weakness, which is characteristic of a container not suitable for microwave heating.

The problem then becomes a variation of the **Derangement Problem** or a **Bipartite Matching** problem. We need to find a perfect matching (N pairs) such that no edge connects a boy to a girl with the same name.\n\n**Simplified Logic for \"at least one such configuration exists\":**\n\n*   If `N > M`, it's impossible to pair all N boys with distinct girls, so the answer is \"No\".

These are the names that appear in both lists.\n    *   Let `k = |Forbidden_Names|`. These are the `k` boys whose names are also girl names, and these `k` girls whose names are also boy names.\n    *   For a valid configuration to exist, each of the `N` boys must be paired with a girl whose name is *different* from his.\n    *   Consider the `k` boys whose names are in `Forbidden_Names`. Each of these `k` boys *cannot* be paired with the `k` girls who share those same names.\n    *   The remaining `N - k` boys (whose names are not in `Forbidden_Names`) can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\n    *   The `k` boys whose names *are* in `Forbidden_Names` must be paired with girls whose names are *not* identical to their own. There are `M - k` such girls available (the girls whose names are not in `Forbidden_Names`).\n    *   If `N - k` boys can be paired with `M - k` girls, and the `k` boys can be paired with the remaining `M - k` girls, then a solution exists.\n\n**A simpler condition for \"Yes\":**\n\nA configuration where no pair has the same names exists if and only if the number of boys whose names are *not* shared with any girl's name is sufficient to pair with the girls whose names *are* shared, or if there are enough unique girls for the boys with shared names.\n\nThis is equivalent to checking if the number of boys whose names are also girl names (`k`) is less than or equal to the number of girls whose names are *not* boy names (`M - k`).\n\n**More precisely, using Hall's Marriage Theorem or a simpler pigeonhole principle:**\n\nIf there are `k` boys whose names are also girl names, these `k` boys *must* be paired with `k` distinct girls whose names are *not* among the `k` forbidden names. This requires `M - k >= k`.\nAnd the remaining `N - k` boys must be paired with the remaining `M - k - k` girls.\n\nThis is getting overly complex for a simple \"Yes/No\" existence check. The most straightforward interpretation for \"at least one such configuration exists\" is:\n\n**If the number of boys (`N`) is greater than the number of girls (`M`), it's impossible to pair every boy, so \"No\".**\n\n**If `N <= M`:**\nWe need to find `N` pairs `(boy_i, girl_j)` such that `boy_i_name != girl_j_name`.\nThis is always possible unless *all* `N` boys have names that are also present among the `M` girls, AND there are not enough \"non-matching\" girls for these boys.\n\nLet `S_B` be the set of boy names.\nLet `S_G` be the set of girl names.\nLet `Common_Names = S_B INTERSECT S_G`.\nLet `k = |Common_Names|`.\n\nWe need to pair `N` boys.\n`k` boys have names that are also girl names.\n`N - k` boys have names that are *not* girl names. These `N - k` boys can be paired with any `N - k` distinct girls without conflict.\n\nThe `k` boys whose names are in `Common_Names` must be paired with girls whose names are *not* identical to their own.\nThere are `M` girls in total. `k` of these girls have names in `Common_Names`.\nSo, there are `M - k` girls whose names are *not* in `Common_Names`.\n\nIf we pair the `N - k` \"unique\" boys with `N - k` girls from the `M - k` \"unique\" girls, we are left with:\n*   `k` boys (whose names are in `Common_Names`)\n*   `M - k - (N - k)` = `M - N` \"unique\" girls\n*   `k` girls (whose names are in `Common_Names`)\n\nThe `k` boys with common names must be paired with `k` girls whose names are *not* their own.\nThis is a derangement problem on a subset.\n\n**A simpler condition:**\nA valid pairing exists if and only if for every subset of boys `X`, the number of girls `Y` such that `girl_name != boy_name` for all `boy_name` in `X` and `girl_name` in `Y` is at least `|X|`. This is Hall's condition.\n\n**For the specific problem \"at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names\":**\n\nThe only way such a configuration *would not* exist is if every possible pairing for at least one boy results in `boy_name == girl_name`. This is impossible if there are more girls than boys, or if there's at least one girl whose name is not a boy's name.\n\nThe condition for \"No\" is if and only if `N > M` OR if `N == M` AND all `N` boy names are identical to the `N` girl names (after sorting, for example).\n\nLet's re-read: \"We assume that each boy is randomly paired with a girl for a project (Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name).\" This note is confusing. \"more than 1 pair having same name\" could mean (Boy A, Girl B) and (Boy C, Girl D) where B=D. But the problem says \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls\".\n\nThe most straightforward interpretation of \"no pair has same names\" is that for any given pair `(Boy_i, Girl_j)`, `Boy_i_name != Girl_j_name`.\n\n**Final Simplified Logic:**\n\n1.  **If N > M:** It's impossible to pair each of the N boys with a *distinct* girl, let alone worry about names. So, \"No\". (Assuming \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\" implies unique pairings for each boy).\n2.  **If N <= M:**\n    *   Count the number of boys whose names are also present in the list of girl names. Let this be `k`.\n    *   Count the number of girls whose names are also present in the list of boy names. This will also be `k`.\n    *   We need to pair `N` boys.\n    *   The `N-k` boys whose names are *not* in the girl list can be paired with any `N-k` girls without conflict.\n    *   The `k` boys whose names *are* in the girl list must be paired with girls whose names are *different* from their own. There are `M-k` such girls (girls whose names are not in the common set).\n    *   If `k <= M - k`, then it's always possible to find such a pairing. This simplifies to `2k <= M`.\n\n**Example provided:**\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil (8 names, not 4)\nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta (10 names, not 6)\n\nLet's assume the actual N and M are 4 and 6, and the names are truncated or selected from the given lists.\n\nLet's assume the input was:\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nIn this case:\n`S_B = {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya}`\n`S_G = {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan}`\n`Common_Names = S_B INTERSECT S_G = {}` (No common names)\n`k = 0`\n\nSince `k = 0`, there are no boys whose names are also girl names. Therefore, any pairing of 4 boys with 4 distinct girls from the 6 available girls will satisfy the condition `boy_name != girl_name`.\nSo, the answer would be \"Yes\".\n\n**If the problem implies a specific scenario where N boys are paired with N girls, and the remaining M-N girls are left unpaired:**\n\nThe condition for \"Yes\" is that there exists a permutation `p` of `N` girls (from the `M` available) such that for each boy `i` from `1` to `N`, `Boy_i_name != Girl_p[i]_name`.\n\nThis is a standard bipartite matching problem. A perfect matching exists if and only if Hall's condition is met.\nHowever, for a simple \"Yes/No\" existence, it's often easier to think about the constraints.\n\nThe only way it's \"No\" is if the number of boys whose names are in `Common_Names` is too high relative to the number of girls whose names are *not* in `Common_Names`.\n\n**Let's use the provided example input as literally as possible, assuming N=4 and M=6, and the names are just a pool.** This is still problematic.\n\n**Assuming the problem meant:**\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: `B1, B2, B3, B4`\nGirls: `G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6`\nAnd the names are given as:\n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya` (for boys)\n`Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan` (for girls)\n\nThen:\n`S_B = {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya}`\n`S_G = {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan}`\n`Common_Names = {}`\n`k = 0`\n\nSince `k=0`, no boy shares a name with any girl. Thus, any pairing will satisfy the condition.\nAnswer: **Yes**\n\n**What if there were common names?**\nN=2, M=3\nBoys: Alex, Bob\nGirls: Alex, Carol, David\n\n`S_B = {Alex, Bob}`\n`S_G = {Alex, Carol, David}`\n`Common_Names = {Alex}`\n`k = 1`\n\nBoy Alex cannot be paired with Girl Alex.\nBoy Bob can be paired with any girl.\n\nPossible pairings:\n(Alex, Carol), (Bob, Alex) - Valid\n(Alex, David), (Bob, Alex) - Valid\n\nSo, \"Yes\".\n\n**What if it's impossible?**\nN=2, M=2\nBoys: Alex, Bob\nGirls: Alex, Bob\n\n`S_B = {Alex, Bob}`\n`S_G = {Alex, Bob}`\n`Common_Names = {Alex, Bob}`\n`k = 2`\n\nBoy Alex cannot be paired with Girl Alex.\nBoy Bob cannot be paired with Girl Bob.\n\nPossible pairings:\n(Alex, Bob), (Bob, Alex) - Valid! (No boy is paired with a girl of the same name)\nSo, \"Yes\".\n\nThis means my `2k <= M` condition is too strict. The problem is a derangement.\n\n**The condition for \"No\" is if and only if it's impossible to form N pairs where `boy_name != girl_name`.**\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be solved with a maximum bipartite matching algorithm (e.g., Hopcroft-Karp or augmenting paths with DFS/BFS).\nCreate a bipartite graph:\n*   Left side: N boys\n*   Right side: M girls\n*   Draw an edge from `Boy_i` to `Girl_j` if `Boy_i_name != Girl_j_name`.\n*   The answer is \"Yes\" if a matching of size `N` exists in this graph.\n\n**However, for the specific constraints of this problem (N distinct boy names, M distinct girl names), a simpler condition often applies.**\n\nLet `B_names` be the set of boy names.\nLet `G_names` be the set of girl names.\nLet `Forbidden_pairs = {(b, g) | b in B_names, g in G_names, b == g}`.\n\nThe question is: can we select `N` pairs `(b_i, g_j)` such that all `b_i` are distinct, all `g_j` are distinct, and `(b_i, g_j)` is not in `Forbidden_pairs`?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a perfect matching of size `N` in the bipartite graph where edges are `(b, g)` if `b != g`.\n\n**The only way this is \"No\" is if N > M, or if N = M and the only possible pairings are all forbidden.**\nExample: N=1, M=1. Boy: Alex, Girl: Alex.\nHere, `N=1, M=1`. `S_B={Alex}`, `S_G={Alex}`. `Common_Names={Alex}`.\nThe only possible pairing is (Alex, Alex), which is forbidden. So, \"No\".\n\nExample: N=2, M=2. Boys: Alex, Bob. Girls: Alex, Bob.\n`S_B={Alex, Bob}`, `S_G={Alex, Bob}`. `Common_Names={Alex, Bob}`.\nForbidden pairs: (Alex, Alex), (Bob, Bob).\nPossible pairings: (Alex, Bob), (Bob, Alex). This is valid. So, \"Yes\".\n\nThis is a derangement problem. If `N` items are to be permuted such that no item stays in its original position, a derangement exists for `N >= 2`. For `N=1`, it does not.\n\nSo, if `N <= M`:\n1.  Count `k = |S_B INTERSECT S_G|`. These are the `k` boys and `k` girls with common names.\n2.  If `N > M`, output \"No\".\n3.  If `N <= M`:\n    *   If `k == 0` (no common names), then \"Yes\".\n    *   If `k > 0`:\n        *   If `N - k` (boys with unique names) is greater than `M - k` (girls with unique names), then it's impossible to pair the unique boys with unique girls, leaving the common-named boys with only common-named girls. This is not quite right.\n\n**Correct Logic for \"Yes\" / \"No\" based on Derangement Principle:**\n\nA configuration where no pair has the same names exists if and only if:\n\n1.  **N > M:** It's impossible to pair all N boys with distinct girls. So, \"No\".\n2.  **N <= M:**\n    *   Let `k` be the number of names that appear in *both* the boy list and the girl list.\n    *   If `k == 0`: No boy shares a name with any girl. Any pairing works. \"Yes\".\n    *   If `k > 0`:\n        *   We have `k` boys whose names are \"forbidden\" to `k` specific girls.\n        *   We have `N - k` boys whose names are not forbidden to any girl.\n        *   We have `M - k` girls whose names are not forbidden to any boy.\n        *   We have `k` girls whose names are forbidden to `k` specific boys.\n\n        The problem is equivalent to asking if there's a derangement of the `k` \"forbidden\" boys onto `k` \"forbidden\" girls, while also pairing the `N-k` \"non-forbidden\" boys with `N-k` \"non-forbidden\" girls.\n\n        A simpler way to think about it:\n        If `N <= M`, the only way it's \"No\" is if the number of boys `N` is equal to the number of girls `M`, AND all `N` boy names are identical to the `N` girl names, AND `N=1`.\n        For `N=1`, if `Boy_1_name == Girl_1_name`, then \"No\".\n        For `N >= 2`, if `N == M` and all names are common, a derangement always exists.\n\n        So, if `N <= M`:\n        *   Count `k = |S_B INTERSECT S_G|`.\n        *   If `k == N` (all boys have names that are also girl names) AND `N == M` (all girls have names that are also boy names):\n            *   If `N == 1`, then \"No\" (e.g., Boy: Alex, Girl: Alex).\n            *   If `N >= 2`, then \"Yes\" (e.g., Boys: Alex, Bob; Girls: Alex, Bob -> pair (Alex, Bob), (Bob, Alex)).\n        *   Otherwise (if `k < N` or `N < M`), then \"Yes\". This covers cases where there's at least one boy with a unique name, or at least one girl with a unique name, or more girls than boys.\n\n**Let's apply this final logic to the example (assuming N=4, M=6 and names are truncated):**\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\n1.  `N=4`, `M=6`. `N <= M` is true.\n2.  `S_B = {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya}`\n3.  `S_G = {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan}`\n4.  `k = |S_B INTERSECT S_G| = 0`.\n5.  Since `k == 0`, the condition `k == N` is false.\n6.  Therefore, output \"Yes\".\n\n**Python Implementation (based on the final logic):**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    \n    boy_names_list = input().split()\n    girl_names_list = input().split()\n\n    # Adjust boy_names_list and girl_names_list to match N and M\n    # This is crucial because the example input has more names than N and M\n    # Assuming the first N names are for boys and first M names for girls\n    boys = set(boy_names_list[:N])\n    girls = set(girl_names_list[:M])\n\n    if N > M:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    # Count common names\n    common_names_count = 0\n    for name in boys:\n        if name in girls:\n            common_names_count += 1\n            \n    # Case 1: No common names.

It does not refer to the singular \"professor\" in a possessive or direct recipient sense for the action of handing *back* the tests. It would imply the professor handed *them* (the tests) back to *us*, but the structure \"handed them back our tests\" is incorrect.\n*   **(B) its:** This is a possessive pronoun for an inanimate object or an animal. A professor is a person, so \"its\" is grammatically incorrect.\n*   **(C) her:** This is a possessive pronoun (referring to the professor's tests) or an object pronoun (referring to the professor as the recipient of the action, which doesn't fit the context of handing *back* tests *to us*). However, in the context of \"handed **her** back our tests,\" it implies the professor is female and the tests belong to her, or she is the recipient of the tests *from* us, which is not the intended meaning of the sentence.\n*   **(D) his:** Similar to (C), this is a possessive pronoun (referring to the professor's tests) or an object pronoun.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sentence structure and common usage. The phrase \"handed [pronoun] back our tests\" implies that the professor is the one performing the action, and the pronoun refers to the professor's *possession* of the tests before handing them back *to us*.\n\nThe most natural and grammatically correct way to complete this sentence, implying the professor returned *our* tests, would be:\n\n*   \"The professor handed **us** back our tests today.\" (Here, \"us\" is the indirect object, the recipient.)\n*   \"The professor handed **back our tests** today.\" (No pronoun needed if \"us\" is implied or understood.)\n\nHowever, the options provided are (A) them, (B) its, (C) her, (D) his. None of these perfectly fit the most common and direct grammatical construction for the intended meaning of the professor returning *our* tests *to us*.\n\nLet's consider an alternative interpretation where the blank refers to the *professor's* tests, and the sentence is slightly elliptical, meaning \"The professor handed [the professor's] tests back [to us] today.\"\n\nIn this specific construction: \"The professor handed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ back our tests today.\"\n\nIf the blank is meant to refer to the professor's *own* tests (which is an unusual context for \"our tests\"), then \"her\" or \"his\" could be possessive pronouns. But the phrase \"our tests\" makes this interpretation highly unlikely.\n\nLet's assume the blank is meant to be an indirect object, indicating *to whom* the tests were handed back. In that case, none of the options (them, its, her, his) are correct as indirect objects for \"our tests.\" The indirect object should be \"us.\"\n\nHowever, if the sentence is interpreted as \"The professor handed [the tests] back [to a group of people] today,\" and the blank is meant to be the direct object *tests*, then \"them\" would be the pronoun for \"tests.\" But the sentence already has \"our tests.\"\n\nGiven the constraints, let's consider the most plausible interpretation where the blank is meant to refer to the professor's *gender* in a possessive sense, implying \"the professor handed back *her* tests\" or \"handed back *his* tests.\" But again, \"our tests\" makes this problematic.\n\nLet's re-examine the options as if the blank is meant to be a pronoun referring to the *professor* in some way, and the sentence structure is slightly colloquial or incomplete.\n\nIf the sentence is meant to imply \"The professor handed back **her** (or **his**) tests to us today,\" and the \"our tests\" is redundant or a mistake in the prompt, then (C) and (D) would be possible if we knew the professor's gender.\n\nHowever, if we strictly adhere to the given sentence \"The professor handed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ back our tests today,\" and the options, there's a grammatical conflict.\n\nLet's consider the most common way this type of sentence is constructed:\n\"The professor handed **us** back our tests today.\" (Here, \"us\" is the indirect object.)\n\nIf the blank *must* be filled by one of the given options, and assuming a slight colloquialism or a less formal structure where the blank refers to the professor's *gender* in a possessive sense, implying the tests *belonged* to the professor before being graded and returned:\n\n*   \"The professor handed **her** back our tests today.\" (If the professor is female)\n*   \"The professor handed **his** back our tests today.\" (If the professor is male)\n\nThis interpretation is still awkward because \"our tests\" implies the tests belong to the students, not the professor.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the blank is meant to be a pronoun referring to the *tests* themselves, and the sentence is poorly constructed. If the sentence was \"The professor handed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ back today,\" then \"them\" would be correct. But \"our tests\" is already there.\n\n**Conclusion based on strict grammatical and contextual fit with the given options:**\n\nNone of the options (A) them, (B) its, (C) her, (D) his, fit perfectly and unambiguously into the blank in the sentence \"The professor handed \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ back our tests today\" to convey the standard meaning of a professor returning graded tests to students.\n\nHowever, if forced to choose the *most plausible* options under the assumption that the blank is meant to indicate the professor's gender (as in \"the professor handed back *her* tests\" or \"handed back *his* tests\"), and the \"our tests\" is a slightly redundant or colloquial phrasing, then **(C) her** and **(D) his** would be the only possibilities, depending on the professor's gender.\n\nGiven the instruction \"There can be multiple answers for each question, so choose all correct options,\" and the ambiguity, the most charitable interpretation is that the blank is asking for a possessive pronoun for the professor, implying the tests were *theirs* to hand back.\n\nTherefore, the correct options, assuming the professor's gender is unknown and either is possible, are:\n**(C) her**\n**(D) his**\n\nThis assumes the sentence is slightly elliptical for \"The professor handed back **her/his** (graded) tests to us today.\"", "HAPPY", "Analyzing the task: remove duplicates from a list of strings while preserving the original order.\n\nGiven the input: `['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']`\n\nIn this specific instance, the provided list `['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']` **does not contain any duplicate elements**.

This is not possible with 123456 as it's the smallest permutation.\n\n*   **Correction for Smallest Permutation:**\n    The number 123456 is already the **smallest possible permutation** of its digits.

Zoning ordinances regulate land use and development within a municipality.

While it might not explicitly state the *requirement* for a permit in its opening sections (as that's often in zoning), it will certainly have sections on:\n    *   **Permit Application Process:** How to apply for a permit.\n    *   **Inspections:** The various stages of construction that require inspection by city officials.\n    *   **Violations and Enforcement:** What constitutes a violation of the building code and the penalties for non-compliance, which would include building without a permit.\n\n3.  **Municipal Code / City Ordinances:** This is the broader collection of all local laws.
