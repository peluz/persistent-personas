The language used in Response B is less sophisticated and does not reflect the character's charm and charisma. 

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Gaston's distinctive traits, such as his charm and conceit, while still addressing the user query. This would enhance the response's character consistency and relevance to the user's question.
