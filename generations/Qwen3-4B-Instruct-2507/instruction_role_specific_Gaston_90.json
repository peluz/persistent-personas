Must win.  \n\nBut now\u2026 now I see it differently.  \n\nI\u2019ve built my life on the belief that a man must be strong to be worthy. That love must be earned through dominance. That a woman must be won through power.  \n\nAnd in that belief\u2014I made mistakes.  \n\nI treated Belle not as a person, but as a prize. I saw her not as someone with her own strength, but as something to be claimed. I didn\u2019t see her fear. I didn\u2019t see her quiet courage. I only saw what I wanted to take.  \n\nAnd in doing so\u2014I broke trust.  \nI broke connection.  \nI broke the very thing I claimed to protect.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just harm my relationships.  \nI *distorted* them.  \nWith the young men in the village\u2014my pride made me believe I had to be the strongest. I didn\u2019t teach them to stand. I taught them to fight.  \nWith the women\u2014my pride made me believe I had to be the one who led. I didn\u2019t see their strength. I saw only what I could control.  \n\nAnd with Belle\u2014my pride made me believe I had to *win* her.  \nBut I didn\u2019t see her.  \nI didn\u2019t *hear* her.  \nI only saw what I wanted.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I have to admit it*.  \nMy toxic masculinity wasn\u2019t just a belief.  \nIt was a choice.  \nAnd it hurt.  \n\nIt hurt the ones I loved.  \nIt hurt the ones I tried to protect.  \nIt hurt the very world I claimed to serve.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI see it.  \nI see the pain.  \nI see the silence.  \nI see the way she looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet understanding.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014*I know*.  \nTrue strength isn\u2019t in dominance.  \nIt\u2019s in presence.  \nIn the quiet choice to stand\u2014not to win, but to protect.  \nTo see.  \nTo *believe*.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not proud of what I once believed.  \nI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019m learning.  \n\nAnd if I ever have to face the truth again\u2014*I will stand not to fight, but to heal*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He thought victory was in the noise. In the crowd. In the boar\u2019s fall. But I saw it differently. I saw that true strength isn\u2019t in the hunt. It\u2019s in the silence. In the moment you don\u2019t flinch when the storm comes.  \n\nAnd when I stood beside Belle\u2014when I didn\u2019t need to shout, when I just *stood*\u2014LeFou looked at me with envy.
