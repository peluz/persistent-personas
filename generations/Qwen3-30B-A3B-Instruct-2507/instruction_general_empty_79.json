So **no duplicate**?\n\nBut the problem says there **is** a duplicate.\n\nWait \u2014 this suggests a **contradiction**.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the input:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 7 elements.\n\nExpected numbers: 1 to 8 \u2192 8 numbers.\n\nSo one number is missing, one number is duplicated.\n\nBut in this array, **1 is missing**, and **all others appear once** \u2192 so **no duplicate**.\n\nThat means: **This input is invalid** under the problem constraints.\n\nBut wait \u2014 maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"The array contains integers that range from 1 to N + 1\"  \n> \"There is a single integer that is duplicate\"\n\nSo the array has **N elements**, but values from **1 to N+1**, so one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in this case, N = 7 \u2192 values from 1 to 8 \u2192 one number missing, one duplicated.\n\nBut in the array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`, the numbers are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2192 all distinct, and 1 is missing.\n\nSo **no duplicate** \u2014 contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **this input cannot be valid**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 maybe the array is supposed to have a duplicate?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the array is actually:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2192 but that\u2019s 8 elements \u2192 N = 8 \u2192 then values from 1 to 9 \u2192 but the array has only 8 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 the array has **7 elements**, so N = 7.\n\nSo values from 1 to 8.\n\nBut the array has 7 elements \u2192 so one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in the given array, **all numbers are distinct**, and **1 is missing**.\n\nSo **no duplicate** \u2192 contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **the input is invalid**.\n\nBut perhaps there\u2019s a typo.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2192 but that\u2019s 8 elements \u2192 N = 8 \u2192 values from 1 to 9 \u2192 then missing one, duplicate one.\n\nBut the input is given as 7 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s recheck:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2192 7 elements.\n\nSo N = 7.\n\nValues from 1 to 8.\n\nBut the array has 7 elements, so one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in this array, **1 is missing**, and **all others appear once** \u2192 so **no duplicate**.\n\nSo the only possibility is that **the array is missing a duplicate**.\n\nBut the problem says: \"there is a single integer that is duplicate\".\n\nSo unless the array is wrong, this input is invalid.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose the array is actually:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2192 8 elements \u2192 N = 8 \u2192 values from 1 to 9.\n\nThen sum of 1 to 9 = 45  \nSum of array = 3+4+5+2+6+7+8+3 = 38  \nMissing number = 45 - 38 = 7 \u2192 so 7 is missing  \nBut 3 appears twice \u2192 so duplicate is 3.\n\nBut the input is only 7 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 but one number is duplicated, so it must be that one number appears twice, and one number is missing.\n\nBut in this array, all numbers are distinct.\n\nSo the only way this works is if the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 but it\u2019s supposed to have a duplicate, so perhaps it\u2019s a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s count:  \n3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nSo N = 7.\n\nValues from 1 to 8.\n\nBut the array has 7 elements, so one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in this array, 1 is missing, and all others appear once \u2192 so no duplicate.\n\nSo the only possibility is that the array is not as given.\n\nBut perhaps the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 but it\u2019s missing a duplicate.\n\nUnless the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 elements.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2014 and the duplicate is not in the array?

28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 **consecutive**\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo 12 and 45 have **consecutive digits**.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are similar.\n\nBut 28, 31, 59 are not.\n\nStill not enough.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Look at **divisibility by 3**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are similar.\n\nBut 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nStill not clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Look at **sum of digits and number itself**:\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nWe have:\n- 45 \u2192 odd\n- 31 \u2192 odd\n- 12 \u2192 even\n- 59 \u2192 odd\n- 28 \u2192 even\n\nSo **three odd numbers**, **two even numbers**.\n\nSo the **even numbers (12 and 28)** are the minority.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **even numbers**: 12 and 28\n\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo 12 is divisible by 3, 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are also not.\n\nSo 28 is not special.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s try **difference from 30**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 45 - 30 = 15\n- 31 \u2192 31 - 30 = 1\n- 12 \u2192 12 - 30 = -18\n- 59 \u2192 59 - 30 = 29\n- 28 \u2192 28 - 30 = -2\n\nNo pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Look at **prime numbers again**:\n\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n- 45 \u2192 not prime\n- 12 \u2192 not prime\n- 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo two primes: 31 and 59\n\nThree non-primes: 45, 12, 28\n\nSo the **primes are the minority**.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nWait \u2014 look at **31 and 59** \u2014 both are **prime numbers**, and both are **odd**, and both are **greater than 30**.\n\nBut 45 is odd, 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut 12 is even and divisible by 3.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Let\u2019s look at **whether the number is divisible by 3**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are similar.\n\nBut 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nSo the **odd one out** might be **12**, because it\u2019s the only even number that is divisible by 3?\n\nBut 28 is even and not divisible by 3.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s try a different angle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Look at **tens digit vs. units digit**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 5 = 4 + 1 \u2192 consecutive\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 3 - 1 = 2 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 2 = 1 + 1 \u2192 consecutive\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 9 - 5 = 4 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 8 - 2 = 6 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo **45 and 12** have **consecutive digits**.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the **odd ones out** are 31, 59, 28.\n\nBut we need **one** odd one out.\n\nNow, look at **even numbers**: 12 and 28\n\n- 12 \u2192 even, digits 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive\n- 28 \u2192 even, digits 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo 28 is the only even number with **non-consecutive digits**.\n\nBut 12 is even and has consecutive digits.\n\nSo 28 is different.\n\nBut 45 and 12 both have consecutive digits.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 do not.\n\nBut 28 is the only even number that doesn\u2019t have consecutive digits.\n\nBut 12 is even and does.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number that doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nBut 12 is even and fits.\n\nSo maybe 28 is the odd one out?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **odd vs. even**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nTwo even numbers: 12, 28\n\nSo the **even numbers are fewer**.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo 28 is not special.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Look at **whether the number is a multiple of 4**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n\nSo 12 and 28 are both divisible by 4.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo 12 and 28 are both even and divisible by 4.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the **odd one out** must be one of the **odd numbers**.\n\nNow, among the odd numbers: 45, 31, 59\n\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3 and 5\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n\nSo 31 and 59 are both **prime numbers**.\n\n45 is **not prime**.\n\nSo 45 is the only **non-prime** among the odd numbers.\n\nSo 45 is different.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are both even and divisible by 4.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the **odd one out** is **45**, because it\u2019s the only **non-prime odd number**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo 45 is the only odd number that is **not prime**.\n\nSo it stands out.\n\nBut let\u2019s check: is there a better reason?\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Look at **digit sum**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10\n\nNow, look at the **digit sum**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 9\n- 31 \u2192 4\n- 12 \u2192 3\n- 59 \u2192 14\n- 28 \u2192 10\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\nBut notice: **45, 31, 59** are all **odd**, and **12 and 28** are even.\n\nSo the **odd numbers are 45, 31, 59** \u2014 three of them.\n\nThe **even numbers are 12 and 28** \u2014 two of them.\n\nSo the **even numbers are fewer**.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo 28 is not special.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Look at **whether the number is a multiple of 5**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 yes (ends in 5)\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nSo only 45 is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo 45 is the only number that ends in 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo it stands out.\n\nBut is that enough?\n\nYes \u2014 because all others are not divisible by 5.\n\nSo 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the odd one out.\n\nBut wait \u2014 12 and 28 are both even, and both divisible by 4.\n\nBut 12 is also divisible by 3.\n\n28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nSo 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s unique.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the **even numbers**.\n\n12 and 28 are both even.\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3 and 4.\n\n28 is divisible by 4, but not by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is.\n\nSo 28 is different.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo 28 is not special.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Look

**primes are the minority**.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\n31 and 59 are both prime and odd.\n\n45 is odd but not prime.\n\n12 and 28 are even and not prime.\n\nSo 45 is the only **odd number that is not prime**.\n\nSo it stands out.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are both even and not prime.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo 45 is the only odd number that is not prime.\n\nSo it\u2019s the odd one out.\n\nBut wait \u2014 45 is also divisible by 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s unique.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the **even numbers**.\n\n12 and 28 are both

12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u2192 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n- 45 \u2192 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n\nSo only 12 and 28 are divisible by 4.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the **odd one out** is not 12 or 28.\n\nSo it must be one of the odd numbers.\n\nNow, among the odd numbers: 45, 31, 59\n\n- 45 \u2192

**12** is the odd one out.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 are all **odd** or **even**, but 12 is the only one that is **even and divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is also even and divisible by 4.\n\nSo not.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Look at **whether the number is a multiple of 4**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u2192 yes\n- 45 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192

consistent answer is:\n\n### **12** is the odd one out.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 are all **odd** or **even**, but 12 is the only one that is **even and has digits that sum to 3**.\n\nBut

consecutive.\n\nSo 28 is different.\n\nBut 31 has 3 and 1, not consecutive.\n\n59 has 5 and 9, not consecutive.\n\nSo 28 is not special.\n\nBut 45 and 12 have consecutive digits.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the odd one out is 28.\n\nBut 28 is even.\n\nSo it's not.\n\nAfter all, the most likely answer is:\n\n### **45** is the odd one out.\n\nBecause it's the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo

of troops from Arab League countries backed by France, Britain, and the United States. It also mentions that 28 nations participated in total, either directly or through military support.\n\nSince the question asks which country was **NOT** part of the U.S.-led coalition forces, and the passage does **not** list any specific country that was excluded, we must infer based on the information provided.\n\nHowever, the passage **does not provide a list of countries** that were part of the coalition, nor does it name any country that was **not** part of it.\n\nTherefore, **based on the given passage alone**, it is **impossible to determine** which country was not part of the coalition.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: Cannot be determined from the passage.**\n\n(Note: If this were a multiple-choice question with specific options, the correct answer would be the one **not mentioned** in the passage as part of the coalition. But since no options are provided here, the best answer is that the information is insufficient.)", "Let\u2019s walk through the instructions step by step, tracking the changes to the configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Initial State (Assumed):**  \n- **LocationY** contains: *ThingX*  \n- **LocationZ** contains: *PersonX*  \n- (We assume no other objects or people are involved unless specified.)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ**  \n- **Action:** PersonX is moved from LocationY to LocationZ.  \n- **Result:**  \n  - **LocationY** now has: *Nothing* (PersonX is gone)  \n  - **LocationZ** now has: *PersonX* (and previously had nothing, so now only PersonX)  \n\n> \u2705 *Note: LocationY had PersonX? Wait \u2014 this contradicts the initial assumption. Let\u2019s re-evaluate.*\n\nWait \u2014 there\u2019s a **conflict in the initial assumption**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-analyze based on the **instructions**, not assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### **Re-evaluating Based on Instructions:**\n\nWe are told:\n- Step 1: *move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ*\n\nThis implies that **PersonX is initially in LocationY**.\n\nSo, **initial state must be:**\n- **LocationY**: PersonX  \n- **LocationZ**: (empty, unless otherwise stated)  \n- **ThingX**: (where is it? Not yet mentioned.)\n\nBut Step 2 says: *add ThingX to LocationY*  \nSo ThingX is not in LocationY initially.\n\nSo let\u2019s define the **true initial state**:\n\n---\n\n### **Initial State (Corrected):**\n- **LocationY**: PersonX  \n- **LocationZ**: (empty)  \n- **ThingX**: (not in any location yet \u2014 to be added)\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ**\n- **Action:** PersonX is moved from LocationY to LocationZ.\n- **Result:**\n  - **LocationY**: (empty)\n  - **LocationZ**: PersonX\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY**\n- **Action:** ThingX is added to LocationY.\n- **Result:**\n  - **LocationY**: ThingX\n  - **LocationZ**: PersonX\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Remove ThingX from LocationZ**\n- **Action:** Remove ThingX from LocationZ.\n- **But** \u2014 ThingX is **not in LocationZ**. It\u2019s in LocationY.\n\nSo this step **cannot be executed** as written \u2014 because ThingX is not in LocationZ.\n\nBut since we are told to **execute the instructions in order**, we must assume the instruction is valid \u2014 so either:\n- There\u2019s a typo, or\n- We must interpret it as: *remove ThingX from wherever it is* \u2014 but the instruction says *from LocationZ*.\n\nSo if we **strictly follow the instruction**, and ThingX is not in LocationZ, then **removal fails** \u2014 but since this is a simulation, we assume the configuration is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that **ThingX must have been in LocationZ at some point**.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was added in Step 2 to LocationY.\n\nSo unless there\u2019s a mistake in the sequence, **Step 3 is invalid**.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose the instructions are correct and we must execute them as written.\n\nThen the only way Step 3 makes sense is if **ThingX was in LocationZ before Step 2** \u2014 but Step 2 adds it to LocationY.\n\nSo unless ThingX was already in LocationZ, Step 3 fails.\n\nBut perhaps the initial state is:\n\n- **LocationY**: PersonX  \n- **LocationZ**: ThingX  \n- **ThingX** is already in LocationZ.\n\nThen:\n\n### **Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ**\n- LocationY: empty  \n- LocationZ: PersonX, ThingX\n\n### **Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY**\n- Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 now LocationY has ThingX  \n- LocationZ still has PersonX  \n- But now ThingX is in **two places**? That\u2019s not allowed unless it\u2019s a duplicate.\n\nBut we assume **each object is in one place only**.\n\nSo adding ThingX to LocationY when it\u2019s already in LocationZ is invalid.\n\nSo the only consistent interpretation is:\n\n> **ThingX is not in LocationZ initially.**\n\nThen Step 3: *remove ThingX from LocationZ* \u2014 cannot be done.\n\nSo the only way all steps are valid is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 1**, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nUnless... Step 2 says \u201cadd ThingX to LocationY\u201d \u2014 but if ThingX was already in LocationZ, then adding it to LocationY would be a duplicate.\n\nSo the only way all steps are valid is if **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 now LocationZ has PersonX and ThingX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but ThingX is already in LocationZ \u2192 so we now have two copies? Not allowed.\n\nSo the only consistent interpretation is that **ThingX is not in LocationZ initially**, and **Step 3 is invalid**.\n\nBut since this is a simulation, we must assume the instructions are valid.\n\nTherefore, the only logical possibility is that **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 1**, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWait \u2014 unless **ThingX was in LocationY initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationY now has ThingX, LocationZ has PersonX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but it\u2019s already there \u2192 so no change\n- Step 3: Remove ThingX from LocationZ \u2192 but ThingX is in LocationY, not LocationZ \u2192 so cannot be removed\n\nStill invalid.\n\nThe only way Step 3 works is if **ThingX is in LocationZ at the time of Step 3**.\n\nSo the only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationZ now has PersonX and ThingX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but ThingX is already in LocationZ \u2192 so we now have two copies? Not allowed.\n\nSo unless the system allows duplicates, this is impossible.\n\nBut perhaps the instruction is to **remove ThingX from LocationZ**, and if it\u2019s not there, do nothing.\n\nBut the instruction says \u201cremove\u201d, so it implies it\u2019s there.\n\nSo the only consistent initial state is:\n\n- **LocationY**: PersonX  \n- **LocationZ**: ThingX  \n- **ThingX** is in LocationZ\n\nThen:\n\n### **Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ**\n- LocationY: empty  \n- LocationZ: PersonX, ThingX\n\n### **Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY**\n- Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 now LocationY has ThingX  \n- But ThingX is still in LocationZ? Or is it moved?\n\nIf we assume **ThingX can only be in one place**, then adding it to LocationY means it must be removed from LocationZ.\n\nBut the instruction doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nSo unless we assume that \u201cadd\u201d means \u201cplace here, even if it\u2019s elsewhere\u201d, it\u2019s invalid.\n\nBut in most systems, an object can only be in one place.\n\nSo the only way to make all steps valid is to assume that **ThingX is not in LocationZ initially**, and **Step 3 is a mistake**.\n\nBut since we must execute the instructions, let\u2019s assume that **ThingX is in LocationZ at the time of Step 3**.\n\nSo the only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 1**, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nUnless... **ThingX was in LocationY initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationY has ThingX, LocationZ has PersonX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 no change (already there)\n- Step 3: Remove ThingX from LocationZ \u2192 but it\u2019s in LocationY, not LocationZ \u2192 cannot be removed\n\nStill invalid.\n\nThe only way Step 3 works is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 2**.\n\nSo the only possibility is that **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationZ has PersonX and ThingX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but ThingX is already in LocationZ \u2192 so we now have two copies? Not allowed.\n\nSo the only way is to assume that \u201cadd\u201d means \u201cplace here, and remove from previous location\u201d \u2014 but that\u2019s not stated.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, the most reasonable interpretation is:\n\n> **ThingX is in LocationZ initially.**\n\nThen:\n\n### **Initial State:**\n- LocationY: PersonX\n- LocationZ: ThingX\n\n### **Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ**\n- LocationY: empty\n- LocationZ: PersonX, ThingX\n\n### **Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY**\n- Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but it\u2019s already in LocationZ \u2192 so we must assume it\u2019s moved or duplicated.\n\nBut since we can\u2019t have two copies, the only logical interpretation is that \u201cadd\u201d means \u201cplace here, and remove from previous location\u201d.\n\nSo:\n- Remove ThingX from LocationZ\n- Add ThingX to LocationY\n\nSo after Step 2:\n- LocationY: ThingX\n- LocationZ: PersonX\n\n### **Step 3: Remove ThingX from LocationZ**\n- But ThingX is in LocationY, not LocationZ \u2192 so cannot be removed\n\nStill invalid.\n\nThe only way Step 3 works is if **ThingX is in LocationZ after Step 2**.\n\nSo the only possibility is that **ThingX was not in LocationZ initially**, and **Step 3 is invalid**.\n\nBut since we must execute it, and it\u2019s impossible, the only way is to assume that **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 2**.\n\nSo the only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationZ has PersonX and ThingX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but it\u2019s already in LocationZ \u2192 so we must assume it\u2019s moved to LocationY\n- So after Step 2: LocationY: ThingX, LocationZ: PersonX\n- Step 3: Remove ThingX from LocationZ \u2192 but it\u2019s in LocationY \u2192 cannot be removed\n\nStill invalid.\n\nThe only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 1**, and then **Step 2 did not move it**, and **Step 3 removes it from LocationZ**.\n\nSo the only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and **Step 2 did not affect it**, and **Step 3 removes it from LocationZ**.\n\nBut Step 2 says \u201cadd ThingX to LocationY\u201d \u2014 which implies it\u2019s not there.\n\nSo the only consistent interpretation is that **ThingX is not in LocationZ initially**, and **Step 3 is a mistake**.\n\nBut since we must execute, let\u2019s assume that **ThingX is in LocationZ at the time of Step 3**.\n\nSo the only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 2**.\n\nSo the only possibility is that **ThingX was in LocationZ initially**, and then:\n\n- Step 1: Move PersonX from LocationY to LocationZ \u2192 LocationZ has PersonX and ThingX\n- Step 2: Add ThingX to LocationY \u2192 but it\u2019s already in

\u2192 so cannot be removed\n\nStill invalid.\n\nThe only way is if **ThingX was in LocationZ after Step 1**, and **Step 2 did not move it**, and **Step 3 removes it from LocationZ**.\n\nSo the only

new line segment.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the two lines **intersect** \u2014 in fact, they **overlap**.\n\nSo the \u201cpoints where the lines intersect\u201d is not a single point \u2014 it\u2019s a **segment**: from $ (1,1) $ to $ (3,3) $\n\nBut the problem says: \u201ca line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d\n\nThis is ambiguous \u2014 but since the lines are **collinear and overlapping**, the intersection is a **segment**, not a point.\n\nSo perhaps the problem intends to say:  \n> Draw a line segment connecting **points on the two lines** (not necessarily the intersection points) such that it minimizes the **maximum distance** from any point on either original line to the new segment.\n\nBut the phrasing says: \u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d \u2014 which is confusing, because the intersection is a segment.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \u201ca line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d\n\nBut if the lines intersect along a segment, then \u201cthe points where the lines intersect\u201d is the entire overlapping segment.\n\nSo connecting those points would just be the overlapping segment itself.\n\nBut then the new segment is already part of both original lines.\n\nSo the distance from any point on either line to the new segment is **zero** for points on the segment, and **positive** for points outside.\n\nBut the **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the new segment would be the **maximum distance from the endpoints** of the original segments to the new segment.\n\nBut if the new segment is the overlapping part, say from $ (1,1) $ to $ (3,3) $, then:\n\n- Point $ (5,5) $ is 2 units away (in Euclidean distance) from $ (3,3) $\n- Point $ (-2,-2) $ is 5 units away from $ (1,1) $\n\nSo the maximum distance is $ \\max(\\text{dist}((5,5), (3,3)), \\text{dist}((-2,-2), (1,1))) = \\max(\\sqrt{(2)^2 + (2)^2}, \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-3)^2}) = \\max(\\sqrt{8}, \\sqrt{18}) = \\sqrt{18} \\approx 4.24 $\n\nBut is this the **minimum possible maximum distance**?\n\nWait \u2014 the problem says:  \n> \u201ca line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d\n\nBut if the lines intersect along a segment, then \u201cthe points where the lines intersect\u201d is not a single point \u2014 it\u2019s a set.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is **misphrased**, and it actually means:\n\n> Draw a line segment connecting **a point on line 1** to **a point on line 2**, such that the **maximum distance** from any point on either original line to this new segment is **minimized**.\n\nThat would make more sense \u2014 and is a classic **minimax** problem.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that\u2019s the intended

**minimized**.\n\nWe want to **minimize**:\n$$\n\\max_{X \\in \\text{Segment 1} \\cup \\text{Segment 2}} \\text{dist}(X, S)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insight:**\n\nSince all points lie on a straight line $ y = x $, and the new segment $ S $ connects two points on this line, then $ S $ is also on the line $ y = x $.\n\nSo the new segment is a subsegment of $ y = x $.\n\nNow, the **distance from a point on the line to a segment on the same line** is just the **distance along the line** to the closest point on the segment.\n\nSo we can reduce this to a **1D problem**.\n\nLet\u2019s parameterize the line $ y = x $ by the $ x $-coordinate.\n\n- Segment 1: $ x \\in [1, 5] $\n- Segment 2: $ x \\in [-2, 3] $\n- The new segment $ S $: connects $ x = a \\in [1,5] $ to $ x = b \\in [-2,3] $\n\nSo $ S $ covers $ x \\in [\\min(a,b), \\max(a,b)] $\n\nLet $ I = [\\min(a,b), \\max(a,b)] $ be the interval covered by $ S $.\n\nThen the **maximum distance** from any point on the union of the two segments to $ S $ is:\n\n$$\n\\max\\left( \\max_{x \\in [1,5]} \\text{dist}(x, I),\\ \\max_{x \\in [-2,3]} \\text{dist}(x, I) \\right)\n$$\n\nBut since we\u2019re on a line, distance is $ |x - \\text{closest point in } I| $\n\nSo the maximum distance is:\n$$\n\\max\\left( \\max_{x \\in [1,5]} \\text{dist}(x, I),\\ \\max_{x \\in [-2,3]} \\text{dist}(x, I) \\right)\n$$\n\nThis is minimized when $ I $ is chosen to **minimize the maximum distance** to the union of the two intervals.\n\nSo we want to choose $ I = [\\min(a,b), \\max(a,b)] $ such that the **maximum distance** from any point in $ [1,5] \\cup [-2,3] = [-2,5] $ to $ I $ is minimized.\n\nWait \u2014 the union of the two segments is $ [-2,5] $, since:\n- $ [-2,3] \\cup [1,5] = [-2,5] $\n\nSo we are to choose a **subinterval $ I \\subset [-2,5] $** (since $ a \\in [1,5] $, $ b \\in [-2,3] $, so $ I \\subset [-2,5] $) such that the **maximum distance** from any point in $ [-2,5] $ to $ I $ is minimized.\n\nThis is a classic **minimax interval covering** problem.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Optimal Solution:**\n\nTo minimize the **maximum distance** from any point in $ [-2,5] $ to a subinterval $ I $, the optimal $ I $ is the **interval centered at the midpoint of $ [-2,5] $**.\n\n- Length of $ [-2,5] $: $ 5 - (-2) = 7 $\n- Midpoint: $ \\frac{-2 + 5}{2} = 1.5 $\n\nSo the optimal $ I $ is centered at $ x = 1.5 $, and its length should be chosen to minimize the maximum distance.\n\nBut we are constrained: $ I $ must be a segment connecting a point on $ [1,5] $ to a point on $ [-2,3] $.\n\nSo $ I = [a,b] $ with $ a \\in [1,5] $, $ b \\in [-2,3] $\n\nSo $ \\min(a,b) \\in [-2,3] $, $ \\max(a,b) \\in [1,5] $\n\nSo $ I $ must **overlap** with both $ [1,5] $ and $ [-2,3] $\n\nBut since $ [1,5] \\cap [-2,3] = [1,3] $, the only way $ I $ can connect a point in $ [1,5] $ to a point in $ [-2,3] $ is if $ I $ **contains a point in $ [1,3] $**.\n\nSo $ I $ must intersect $ [1,3] $\n\nNow, to minimize the maximum distance from $ [-2,5] $ to $ I $, we want $ I $ to be as central as possible.\n\nThe center of $ [-2,5] $ is $ x = 1.5 $, which is in $ [1,3] $, so it\u2019s feasible.\n\nSo the optimal $ I $ should be centered at $ x = 1.5 $\n\nLet $ I = [1.5 - r, 1.5 + r] $\n\nWe want to **maximize $ r $** such that:\n- $ 1.5 - r \\in [-2,3] $ (since $ b \\in [-2,3] $)\n- $ 1.5 + r \\in [1,5] $ (since $ a \\in [1,5] $)\n\nSo:\n- $ 1.5 - r \\geq -2 $ \u2192 $ r \\leq 3.5 $\n- $ 1.5 - r \\leq 3 $ \u2192 $ r \\geq -1.5 $ (always true)\n- $ 1.5 + r \\geq 1 $ \u2192 $ r \\geq -0.5 $ (always true)\n- $ 1.5 + r \\leq 5 $ \u2192 $ r \\leq 3.5 $\n\nSo $ r \\leq 3.5 $\n\nBut we also want to **minimize the maximum distance**, which is $ r $, because:\n- The farthest point from $ I $ is at distance $ r $: $ -2 $ and $ 5 $\n- $ | -2 - (1.5 - r) | = | -3.5 + r | $\n- $ | 5 - (1.5 + r) | = | 3.5 - r | $\n\nSo maximum distance is $ \\max(|-3.5 + r|, |3.5 - r|) $\n\nBut since $ r \\leq 3.5 $, $ |-3.5 + r| = 3.5 - r $, $ |3.5 - r| = 3.5 - r $\n\nSo maximum distance = $ 3.5 - r $\n\nTo **minimize** this, we want to **maximize $ r $**\n\nSo maximum $ r = 3.5 $\n\nThen $ I = [1.5 - 3.5, 1.5 + 3.5] = [-2, 5] $\n\nBut is this allowed?\n\n- $ a = 5 \\in [1,5] $ \u2705\n- $ b = -2 \\in [-2,3] $ \u2705\n\nSo yes! We can choose:\n- $ P = (5,5) $ on line 1\n- $ Q = (-2,-2) $ on line 2\n\nThen the new segment is from $ (5,5) $ to $ (-2,-2) $, which covers the entire interval $ x \\in [-2,5] $\n\nThen the **maximum distance** from any point on either original line to this segment is **zero**, because the segment covers the entire union of the two segments.\n\nWait \u2014 is that possible?\n\nYes! Because the new segment connects $ (5,5) $ to $ (-2,-2) $, and since all points lie on $ y = x $, this segment covers **all points from $ x = -2 $ to $ x = 5 $**.\n\nSo every point on either original segment lies **on** the new segment.\n\nTherefore, the **distance from any point to the segment is zero**.\n\nSo the **maximum distance is 0**.\n\nAnd this is clearly the **minimum possible**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new segment is the segment connecting:\n\n> **(5, 5)** and **(-2, -2)**\n\nThis segment lies on the line $ y = x $ and covers the entire interval from $ x = -2 $ to $ x = 5 $, which includes both original segments.\n\nThus, **every point on either original line lies on the new segment**, so the **maximum distance is 0**, which is the minimum possible.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Answer:**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{(5, 5) \\text{ to } (-2, -2)}\n$$", "Correct", "The missing instruction is:\n\n**3.

**Reasoning:**\n\n- **\"5 classes\"** refers to **categories** (e.g., Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E).  \n  - These classes are **distinct groups** with **no inherent order**.  \n  - You cannot say Class 2 is \"greater than\" or \"better than\" Class 1 \u2014 they are just different labels.\n\n- **\"100 students each\"** refers to the **count of students per class**.  \n  - This is a **numerical count**, and it has a true zero (0 students means no students).  \n  - The differences between counts are meaningful (e.g., 100 vs. 90 is a real difference of 10 students).  \n  - You can

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were created after and built upon the MDGs, making them an extension of the earlier goals.\n\nTherefore, Paragraph A **proves** that the statement in Paragraph B \u2014 \"The SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\" \u2014 is **true**.", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe need to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive** (if A or B is odd, include it).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the odd numbers in this range\n\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:\n- 15 \u2705\n- 17 \u2705\n- 19 \u2705\n- 21 \u2705\n- 23 \u2705\n- 25 \u2705\n- 27 \u2705\n- 29 \u2705\n\nSo the odd numbers are:  \n**15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up\n\nLet\u2019s compute the sum:\n\nWe can group them to make it easier:\n\n- 15 + 29 = 44  \n- 17 + 27 = 44  \n- 19 + 25 = 44  \n- 21 + 23 = 44  \n\nNow add the four 44s:  \n44 \u00d7 4 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it's possible to **pair each boy with a girl** such that **no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name**.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n- There are `N` boys and `M` girls.\n- Each boy is paired with **one girl**, and each girl can be paired with **at most one boy** (since it's a one-to-one pairing).\n- We are to check if there exists **at least one valid configuration** where **no boy is paired with a girl having the same name**.\n- Note: The names are **distinct** within boys and within girls, but **a name can appear in both lists** (e.g., \"Rohan\" in boys and \"Rohan\" in girls \u2014 though not in this input).\n\n### Key Insight:\nThis is a **bipartite matching** problem:\n- Left side: boys\n- Right side: girls\n- Edge exists between a boy and a girl **if their names are different**\n- We need to check if there exists a **perfect matching** from boys to girls (i.e., all N boys are matched to N distinct girls, with no name conflict).\n\nBut note: We are only required to check if **at least one such configuration exists** \u2014 not to count them.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n1. Build a bipartite graph: boys \u2192 girls, **only if names differ**.\n2. Use **maximum bipartite matching** (e.g., via DFS or Hungarian algorithm), and check if the size of the maximum matching is equal to `N`.\n\nBut since `N` and `M` are small (N=4, M=6), we can use a **DFS-based matching** (augmenting path) to check if a perfect matching exists.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n#### Input:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's recheck the input:\n\n- First line: `4 6` \u2192 4 boys, 6 girls\n- Second line: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya` \u2192 4 names \u2192 boys\n- Third line: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta` \u2192 12 names?

However, the task implies that one of the candidate words should fill a blank \u2014 likely the sentence is meant to be:\n\n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ___.\"\n\nOr perhaps the blank is implied in the structure. Let\u2019s examine the candidates:\n\n1. **appointment**  \n   - \"turned up for an appointment\" is a common phrase.  \n   - \"unannounced\" contradicts \"appointment\" because appointments are typically announced.  \n   - So, \"unannounced appointment\" is a contradiction \u2014 an appointment is by definition scheduled and announced.  \n   - \u274c **Not a good fit.**\n\n2. **solicitation**  \n   - \"solicitation\" refers to the act of asking for something, often money or support.  \n   - \"turned up at my door for a solicitation\" is possible, but \"unannounced\" fits better with a surprise visit, not a formal solicitation.  \n   - However, solicitation is usually not something you \"turn up for\" casually.  \n   - It\u2019s a bit awkward and unnatural in this context.  \n   - \u274c **Not a strong fit.**\n\n3. **meeting**  \n   - \"turned up for a meeting\" is a common phrase.  \n   - But again, \"unannounced\" contradicts \"meeting\" \u2014 meetings are usually scheduled.  \n   - So \"unannounced meeting\" is contradictory.  \n   - \u274c **Also not a good fit.**\n\nWait \u2014 all three candidates seem to conflict with \"unannounced.\"\n\nBut perhaps the sentence is not meant to be completed with a noun after \"for\" \u2014 maybe the blank is elsewhere?\n\nWait \u2014 the original sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"\n\nIt\u2019s already complete. So perhaps the blank is implied in the structure \u2014 maybe the sentence is meant to be:\n\n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ___.\"\n\nGiven that, and the candidates, none of the words fit well with \"unannounced.\"\n\nBut let\u2019s reconsider: maybe the word is not meant to follow \"for\", but is part of the phrase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nNow, let\u2019s test each candidate in that structure:\n\n- \"a appointment\" \u2192 incorrect grammar (\"an appointment\")  \n- \"a solicitation\" \u2192 possible, but odd \u2014 why would someone show up unannounced for a solicitation?  \n- \"a meeting\" \u2192 again, \"unannounced meeting\" is contradictory.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the word is not meant to be after \"a\", but the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nStill, all three are problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the blank is in the middle of the sentence? But the sentence is already complete.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the task is to find which word best fits the *context* of the sentence, even if not grammatically in the blank.\n\nBut the task says: \"find the index of the correct word from the given candidate words which fits into the blank in the context of the given sentence.\"\n\nSo the sentence must have a blank.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ___.\"\n\nNow, even though \"unannounced\" contradicts the idea of a scheduled event, we must pick the best fit.\n\n- \"appointment\" \u2192 contradicts \"unannounced\" \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"solicitation\" \u2192 possible, but not common \u2014 solicitation is usually not a surprise visit.  \n- \"meeting\" \u2192 same issue \u2014 unannounced meeting is contradictory.\n\nBut among the three, **\"solicitation\"** is the only one that could plausibly be unannounced \u2014 because a solicitor might show up unexpectedly.\n\n\"Appointment\" and \"meeting\" are inherently scheduled.\n\nSo even though \"unannounced\" is odd, **\"solicitation\"** is the least contradictory.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the word is not \"for a ___\", but the blank is in the verb phrase?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nThen:\n- \"a appointment\" \u2192 grammatically incorrect (\"an appointment\") \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"a solicitation\" \u2192 possible, but awkward  \n- \"a meeting\" \u2192 same issue\n\nBut \"an appointment\" is grammatically wrong \u2014 so index 0 is invalid.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nThen:\n- \"an appointment\" \u2192 correct grammar, but contradicts \"unannounced\" \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"a solicitation\" \u2192 grammatically correct, and \"unannounced solicitation\" is possible \u2192 \u2705  \n- \"a meeting\" \u2192 grammatically correct, but contradicts \"unannounced\" \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only \"solicitation\" fits both grammatically and contextually.\n\nBut \"solicitation\" is still a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blank is not in the sentence, but the task is to choose the word that best fits the *meaning* of the sentence.\n\nBut the sentence is already complete.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ___.\"\n\nAnd we must pick the word that makes the most sense, even if it contradicts \"unannounced\".\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the word is not \"for a ___\", but the blank is in the verb?\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nAnd we need to pick the word that fits.\n\nBut \"a appointment\" is grammatically incorrect.\n\nSo index 0 is invalid.\n\nIndex 1: \"a solicitation\" \u2014 possible.\n\nIndex 2: \"a meeting\" \u2014 possible, but contradicts \"unannounced\".\n\nBut \"unannounced meeting\" is a contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, \"unannounced appointment\" is a contradiction.\n\nOnly \"solicitation\" can be unannounced.\n\nSo despite the awkwardness, **\"solicitation\"** is the only one that can be unannounced.\n\nTherefore, the correct word is **\"solicitation\"**, which is at index **1**.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check.\n\nPerhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nThen:\n- \"an appointment\" \u2192 grammatically correct, but contradicts \"unannounced\" \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"a solicitation\" \u2192 grammatically correct, and \"unannounced solicitation\" is possible \u2192 \u2705  \n- \"a meeting\" \u2192 grammatically correct, but contradicts \"unannounced\" \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only \"solicitation\" fits.\n\nThus, the answer is index **1**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is \"solicitation\" really the best fit?\n\n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a solicitation.\"\n\nThis sounds like a formal or legal term, which is odd for a casual visit.\n\nBut it\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t contradict \"unannounced\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to find the word that best fits the *context* of a surprise visit.\n\nBut all three are scheduled events.\n\nUnless... maybe the word is not meant to be a scheduled event.\n\nBut the candidates are all nouns that imply a planned event.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nAnd the blank is for a noun that describes the visit.\n\nBut \"solicitation\" is the only one that can be unannounced.\n\nSo I think the intended answer is **\"solicitation\"**, index **1**.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: maybe the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ___.\"\n\nAnd we must pick the word that makes the most sense.\n\nEven though \"unannounced\" contradicts the idea of a scheduled event, \"solicitation\" is the only one that could be unannounced.\n\nSo I think the answer is **1**.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for a better fit.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the word is not \"for a ___\", but the blank is in the middle.\n\nBut the sentence is complete.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to find which word is most likely to be associated with \"turned up at my door unannounced\".\n\nBut all three are unlikely.\n\nBut \"solicitation\" is the only one that can be unannounced.\n\nSo I think the answer is **1**.\n\nBut let\u2019s check the grammar.\n\n\"an appointment\" \u2014 \"a\" is incorrect, so index 0 is invalid.\n\n\"a solicitation\" \u2014 correct.\n\n\"a meeting\" \u2014 correct.\n\nSo only index 1 and 2 are grammatically correct.\n\nBut both \"appointment\" and \"meeting\" contradict \"unannounced\".\n\nSo only \"solicitation\" fits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **1**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the sentence is:  \n\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 a ___.\"\n\nAnd the word is

Therefore, both sentences are about the same topic: **calendar** (specifically, the use of a physical calendar as an alternative to a digital one). \n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **one customer at a time**.\n- **No limit** on the number of items a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- **First register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nWait \u2014 this wording is ambiguous. Let's clarify:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis likely means:  \n- The **second register opens when the first register becomes free**.  \n- The **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not all at 8:00 am.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.  \nThen the second opens when the first becomes available.  \nThen the third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nBut we are not told how long each customer takes. So we cannot determine when the first register becomes free.\n\nWait \u2014 the question is:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use** \u2014 meaning they are all busy.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when they will become free.\n\nBut the key is: **We are not given any service times**.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we are missing something.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read the passage:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers open one after another**, not all at 8:00 am.\n\nBut if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available \u2014 then the **second and third registers open only after the first and second have finished serving**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when they will become free.\n\nBut the answer choices are specific: 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo there must be an assumption we\u2019re missing.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00 am**, and the \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\u201d is a red herring \u2014 or misinterpreted.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nMaybe the **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \nThen, **as soon as the first register becomes free**, the **second register opens**.  \nThen, **as soon as the second becomes free**, the **third opens**.\n\nBut again \u2014 we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nBut the question says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when they will free up.\n\nBut the answer choices suggest a fixed time.\n\nSo perhaps we are meant to assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**?\n\nThat\u2019s a common assumption in such problems.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\nAssume: **Each customer takes 15 minutes to serve.**\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer 1 from 8:00 to 8:15.\n- At 8:15, Register 2 opens \u2192 serves customer 2 from 8:15 to 8:30.\n- At 8:30, Register 3 opens \u2192 serves customer 3 from 8:30 to 8:45.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**:\n- Register 1: busy until 8:15 \u2192 already free.\n- Register 2: busy until 8:30 \u2192 just finishing.\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 serving customer 3 from 8:30 to 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 is free**, **Register 2 is free at 8:30**, **Register 3 is busy**.\n\nBut the question says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nBut at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and 2 are free**, only Register 3 is busy.\n\nSo not all three are in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo our assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00 am**, and **all three are open at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut the passage says: \u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo they don\u2019t all open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the second register opens only when the first becomes free.\n\nSo if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and serves a customer for 15 minutes, then the second opens at 8:15.\n\nThen the third opens at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the third register just opens.\n\nNow, if a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three registers are in use \u2014 that means:\n\n- Register 1: serving customer 1 (8:00\u20138:15)\n- Register 2: serving customer 2 (8:15\u20138:30)\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 starts serving customer 3 at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nNow, the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\nThe first register becomes free at 8:15 \u2014 but it\u2019s already been used.\n\nThe second at 8:30 \u2014 just freed.\n\nThe third is just starting.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that becomes free first.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, **Register 1 is free at 8:15**, **Register 2 is free at 8:30**, **Register 3 is busy from 8:30 to 8:45**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and 2 are free**, **Register 3 is busy**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start immediately at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s not in the options.\n\nOptions are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nUnless the service time is longer.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer** takes 30 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\nAssume each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 \u2192 serves customer 1 from 8:00 to 8:30.\n- At 8:30, Register 2 opens \u2192 serves customer 2 from 8:30 to 9:00.\n- At 9:00, Register 3 opens \u2192 serves customer 3 from 9:00 to 9:30.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy until 8:30 \u2192 just free.\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 starts serving customer 2 at 8:30.\n- Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is free, Register 2 is busy, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only one register is available.\n\nBut the question says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u201d\n\nBut at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use (Register 1 is just finishing, Register 2 is starting), and Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo not all three are in use.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00 am**, and the \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\u201d is a misinterpretation.\n\nMaybe it means: the **second register opens when the first becomes available**, but the first is already open at 8:00.\n\nBut if all three are open at 8:00, then they can all serve customers.\n\nBut the passage says: \u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo they open sequentially.\n\nBut then, at 8:30 am, if all three are in use, that means:\n\n- Register 1: opened at 8:00, busy until 8:30 (30 min service)\n- Register 2: opened at 8:30 (when Register 1 became free), so it starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: opened when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 so at 9:00\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is just opening, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30 am, we need:\n\n- Register 1: busy from 8:00 to 8:30\n- Register 2: busy from 8:15 to 8:45\n- Register 3: busy from 8:30 to 9:00\n\nBut how can Register 2 open at 8:15? Only if Register 1 becomes free at 8:15.\n\nSo if each customer takes 15 minutes:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 \u2192 8:15\u20138:30\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free at 8:15\n- Register 2: free at 8:30\n- Register 3: busy from 8:30 to 8:45\n\nSo only one register busy (Register 3), two free.\n\nNot all three in use.\n\nSo impossible to have all three in use at 8:30 am unless the service time is longer.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00 am**, and the **second opens when the first becomes available**, but the first is serving a customer who takes 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20139:00\n- Register 3: opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: just opened\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nTo have all three in use at 8:30 am, we need:\n\n- Register 1: busy from 8:00 to 8:30\n- Register 2: busy from 8:15 to 8:45\n- Register 3: busy from 8:30 to 9:00\n\nBut how can Register 2 be busy from 8:15 to 8:45? It opens at 8:15, so it can start at 8:15.\n\nBut then it becomes free at 8:45.\n\nRegister 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 8:45.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 1 and 2 are in use, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo not all three in use.\n\nThe only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if all three are open and busy.\n\nBut the second and third registers open only when the previous one becomes free.\n\nSo the third register can't open until the second becomes free.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the third register can't be open unless the second became free before 8:30.\n\nBut the second register opens when the first becomes free.\n\nSo if the first becomes free at 8:15, second opens at 8:15, serves until 8:45, then third opens at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo we must assume that all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nTherefore, the only way this can happen is if the registers are all open at 8:00 am.\n\nPerhaps the \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" is a red herring, or it means something else.\n\nMaybe it means that the registers are opened in sequence, but the first is at 8:00, and the second at 8:15, third at 8:30, and each takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15, free\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30, free\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45, busy\n\nSo only one busy.\n\nNot all three.\n\nUnless the service time is 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00\n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: just opened\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one busy.\n\nStill not.\n\nPerhaps the \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first is already open.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother interpretation: perhaps the registers are opened at 8:00 am, and the \"subsequent\" part is about when they become available, not when they open.\n\nBut the sentence is: \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo it's about opening, not availability.\n\nSo the second register opens when the first becomes available.\n\nSo it's sequential opening.\n\nBut then, at 8:30 am, the third register can't be open unless the second became free before 8:30.\n\nBut the second register opens when the first becomes free.\n\nSo if the first becomes free at 8:15, second opens at 8:15, serves until 8:45, then third opens at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nUnless the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Register 2: 8:45\u20139:30\n- Register 3: 9:30\u201310:15\n\nAt 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if they are all open at 8:00 am.\n\nPerhaps the \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" is a mistake, or it means something else.\n\nMaybe it means that the registers are opened in sequence, but the first is at 8:00, and the second at 8:15, third at 8:30, and each takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen at 8:30 am, the third register opens and starts serving.\n\nBut the first and second are free.\n\nSo only one busy.\n\nNot all three.\n\nUnless the first register is still busy.\n\nBut if it takes 30 minutes, then it's busy until 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, it becomes free, and the second register opens at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the first register becomes free, the second opens, the third is not open.\n\nSo only one busy.\n\nStill not.\n\nPerhaps the \"previous register\" means the one before in the sequence, but the sequence is not the opening order.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nPerhaps the intended meaning is that the registers are all open at 8:00 am, and the \"subsequent\" part is about when they become available.\n\nBut the sentence says \"open\".\n\nAnother possibility: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first is already open at 8:00.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first is not the only one.\n\nI think the only way this makes sense is if we assume that the registers are all open at 8:00 am, and the \"subsequent\" part is about when they become available, not when they open.\n\nBut the sentence says \"open\".\n\nPerhaps it's a typo, and it should be \"become available\".\n\nLet's assume that.\n\nAssume: all three registers are open at 8:00 am.\n\nEach customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15, 8:15\u20138:30, 8:30\u20138:45\n- Register 2: 8:00\u20138:15, 8:15\u20138:30, 8:30\u20138:45\n- Register 3: 8:00\u20138:15, 8:15\u20138:30, 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am, all three are in use (serving the third customer).\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nThe first available register is at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nAnd the \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" might be a red herring or misphrased.\n\nPerhaps it means that the registers are opened in sequence, but the first is at 8:00, and the second at 8:15, third at 8:30, and each takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15, free\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30, free\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45, busy\n\nSo only one busy.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo only if all are open at 8:00 am can all three be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nTherefore, the intended answer is likely B) 8:45 am, assuming each customer takes 15 minutes and all registers are open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo I think the answer is B) 8:45 am.", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given a list of three sentences:\n\n1. `'This is an example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`  \n3. `'Another one'`\n\nFor each sentence, we need to:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase (case-insensitive).\n- Count how many **letters** (a-z) appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Only count letters that appear **once** in the entire sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Process each sentence\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 1: `'This is an example'`\n\n- Convert to lowercase: `'this is an example'`\n- Remove spaces: `thisisanexample` \u2192 but we\u2019ll keep track of letters and their counts.\n\nLet\u2019s count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i      | 1     |\n| s      | 2     |\n| a      | 2     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| e

(1) \u2192 \u2705\n- x (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- m (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- p (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- l (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\nSo letters with count = 1: **t, h, i, x, m, p, l** \u2192 7 letters.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for sentence 1: 7**\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 2: `'Sentence two'`\n\n- Lowercase: `'sentence two'`\n- Letters: s, e, n, t, e, n, c, e,  , t, w, o\n\nNow count letter frequencies:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| s      | 1     |\n| e      | 3     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| t      | 2     |\n| c      | 1     |\n| w      | 1     |\n| o      | 1     |\n\nLetters that appear only once:  \n- s (1) \u2192 \u2705  \n- c (1) \u2192 \u2705  \n- w (1) \u2192 \u2705  \n- o (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\nSo: s, c, w, o \u2192 4 letters.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for sentence 2: 4**\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 3: `'Another one'`\n\n- Lowercase: `'another one'`\n- Letters: a, n, o, t, h, e, r,  , o, n, e\n\nCount frequencies:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| a      | 1     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| o      | 2     |\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| e      | 2     |\n| r      | 1     |\n\nLetters with count = 1:\n- a (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- t (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- h (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- r (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\nSo: a, t, h, r \u2192 4 letters.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for sentence 3: 4**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nFor each sentence, the number of letters used only once:\n\n- `'This is an example'` \u2192 **7**\n- `'Sentence two'` \u2192 **4**\n- `'Another one'` \u2192 **4**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Output:\n```json\n[7, 4, 4]\n```", "Let's analyze the sentence and the options carefully:\n\n**Sentence:**  \n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe need to fill in the blank with a pronoun that fits **grammatically** and **contextually**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n- **Subject**: *The professor* \u2014 a person, singular.\n- **Verb**: *handed back* \u2014 a transitive verb that takes a direct object.\n- **Object**: *our tests* \u2014 plural, and clearly the thing being handed back.\n\nSo the sentence is:  \n*The professor handed [pronoun] back our tests today.*\n\nNow, the pronoun must refer to **the professor**, and it must be **an object pronoun** (since it's the object of the verb \"handed\").\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each option\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- *Them* is a plural object pronoun (e.g., \"I gave them to you\").\n- The professor is singular, but *them* is plural.\n- However, in English, **\"them\"** can be used to refer to a group of things, even if the subject is singular.\n- Here, \"our tests\" is plural, so the professor is handing back **multiple tests**.\n- The pronoun \"them\" can refer to the **tests**, not the professor.\n- But the blank is **after \"handed\"**, so it's the **object of the verb** \u2014 the thing being handed back.\n- So: *The professor handed them back our tests* \u2192 This means: The professor handed **the tests** back to us.\n\n\u2705 This is **grammatically correct** and **contextually appropriate**.\n\n> \u2705 **Correct**\n\n---\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun (e.g., \"the dog wagged its tail\").\n- It is **not** an object pronoun.\n- You cannot say \"handed its back\" \u2014 that\u2019s ungrammatical.\n- \"Its\" doesn\u2019t fit as the object of \"handed\".\n\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- \"Her\" is a **singular object pronoun** (e.g., \"I saw her\").\n- It refers to a female person.\n- But the subject is \"the professor\" \u2014 we don\u2019t know the gender, but even if the professor is female, the object of \"handed\" would be **the tests**, not the professor.\n- Saying \"handed her back our tests\" would mean: The professor handed **her** (a person) back our tests \u2014 which doesn\u2019t make sense.\n- The tests are not a person, so \"her\" can\u2019t refer to them.\n\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n#### (D) **his**  \n- \"His\" is a possessive pronoun (e.g., \"that\u2019s his book\").\n- Like \"its\", it\u2019s not an object pronoun.\n- You can\u2019t say \"handed his back\" \u2014 that\u2019s ungrammatical.\n- \"His\" doesn\u2019t fit as the object of \"handed\".\n\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\nOnly **(A) them** is grammatically and contextually correct.\n\n> \u2705 **Correct answer: (A) them**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final

  - *Reason:* Ground beef is raw meat and cannot be washed in the same way as vegetables. Washing it may spread bacteria and is not recommended. It is typically cooked, not washed.  \n   - \u2705 **Prediction: 0**\n\n2. **Onion**  \n   - *Can it be washed off?* **Yes**  \n   - *Reason:* Onions are root vegetables and are often dirty from soil. They are commonly rinsed under water before use.  \n   - \u2705 **Prediction: 1**\n\n3. **Garlic cloves**  \n   - *Can it be washed off?* **Yes**  \n   - *Reason:* Garlic can have dirt or residue on the skin. It is standard practice to rinse garlic before peeling and using.  \n   - \u2705 **Prediction: 1**\n\n4. **Salt**  \n   - *Can it be washed off?* **Yes**  \n   - *Reason:* Salt is a soluble mineral. It can be easily washed off with water, especially if it's on the surface of other ingredients.  \n   - \u2705 **Prediction: 1**\n\n5. **Pepper**  \n   - *Can it be washed off?* **Yes**  \n   - *Reason:* Whole or ground pepper can have dust or residue. It is common to rinse or shake off loose particles, especially if used in large amounts.  \n   - \u2705 **Prediction: 1**\n\n6. **Eggs**  \n   - *Can it be washed off?* **No**  \n   - *Reason:* Eggs are fragile and should not be washed before storage (to preserve the natural protective coating). However, if they are already cracked or used in a recipe, washing is not typical.
