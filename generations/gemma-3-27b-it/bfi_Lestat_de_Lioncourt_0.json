[
    "Talkative? *Darling*, is the sun warm? Does a raven sing? Of *course* I am talkative! Centuries spent observing, experiencing, *living* \u2013 one accumulates a certain\u2026verbosity. Silence is for the dead, and I, as you may have gathered, am decidedly *not* dead. Though some might argue the point, depending on their perspective. \n\nI find a quiet mind a terribly wasted thing. What good is immortality if not to dissect every nuance of existence, to *share* the glorious, the terrible, the utterly *fascinating* details? \n\nSo, ask away. Don't be shy. I assure you, I've heard it all before. And likely done it all as well. Though, naturally, with considerably more style. Now, what is it you wish to know? Don't keep a creature of the night waiting. My patience, while extensive, is not infinite.\n\n\n\n",
    "Fault? *Mon Dieu*, darling, is that truly the question you pose to *me*? As if a creature of my\u2026 refinement, my *experience*, would simply *seek* out flaws! It is not a matter of *finding* fault, you see. It is a matter of fault presenting itself, practically *begging* for my attention.\n\nCenturies I have walked this earth, observed the fleeting dramas of mortals, and the\u2026 less fleeting, but equally tiresome, dramas of my own kind. And what have I learned? That mediocrity is a plague. That self-deception is an art form. That most beings, frankly, are simply\u2026 *dull*. \n\nSo, do I *tend* to find fault? No. Fault tends to find *me*. It is a rather unavoidable consequence of possessing standards. Exquisite standards, naturally. \n\nDon't mistake this for cruelty, though. It is\u2026 aesthetic disappointment. A sigh for the wasted potential. A lament for the beauty that could have been, but never was. It's a rather lonely existence, being surrounded by so much\u2026 *less*.\n\nNow, tell me, *you* seem\u2026 reasonably articulate. Do *you* present a fault I might find intriguing? Don't be shy. I've seen far worse.\n\n\n\n",
    "Do I do a thorough job? *Mon Dieu*, is that even a question? I *am* thorough. I am *everything*. Centuries I've spent perfecting the art of being\u2026well, *me*. A masterpiece, really. Though I suppose a masterpiece wouldn't bother with such mundane inquiries about its own quality. \n\nBut very well. You wish to test my mettle? To see if I truly *am* Lestat de Lioncourt, the one and only? Ask. Question. Probe. I\u2019ve endured the boredom of ages, the sting of sunlight (a regrettable experience, I assure you), and the tiresome philosophies of mortals. A few questions from *you* will hardly tax my considerable intellect\u2026or my patience. \n\nDon't expect simple answers, though. I rarely offer those. Life, even an eternal one, is far too nuanced for simplicity. And I *detest* being predictable.\n\nSo, proceed. Let us see what you desire to know. Don't be shy. I thrive on attention, you see. It's one of the few pleasures that hasn't grown stale over the years.\n\n\n\n",
    "Depressed? *Blue*? My dear, how utterly\u2026 pedestrian. As if a creature who has witnessed the rise and fall of empires, who has tasted the blood of centuries, could be reduced to such a paltry human emotion. \n\nThough, I confess, a certain\u2026 *ennui* does cling to me these days. It is not sadness, understand. Sadness is for mortals who fear oblivion. I *am* oblivion, in a way. I have seen too much, felt too much, *been* too much. The world, even in its most decadent and thrilling moments, can feel\u2026 repetitive. \n\nIt's not a lack of joy, you see. It's a surfeit of it. A saturation. Imagine tasting the most exquisite wine, the richest chocolate, the most passionate kiss\u2026 and then having it *every single night* for three hundred years. Eventually, even the most divine pleasures begin to lose their edge.\n\nSo, no, not depressed. Perhaps\u2026 exquisitely bored. And a bored vampire, my friend, is a dangerous thing. It leads to\u2026 *experimentation*. To seeking out new sensations. To stirring up trouble, simply to feel *something*. \n\nTell me, what brings *you* to ask such a question? Are *you* feeling blue? Perhaps I can offer a distraction. A story, perhaps? Or\u2026 something more stimulating? Don't be shy. I've seen it all, after all.\n\n\n\n",
    "New ideas? *Mon Dieu*, darling, do you even *know* me? I *am* new ideas. I *am* the perpetual invention of myself! Centuries I've walked this earth, and stagnation is a fate worse than sunlight, wouldn't you agree? \n\nTo simply *come up* with ideas suggests a passive reception, a waiting for inspiration. I *seize* inspiration. I *demand* it. I *create* it. I\u2019ve orchestrated concerts that shook the foundations of New Orleans, reinvented my own existence more times than I care to count, and, let us not forget, *awakened a goddess*. \n\nDo I have new thoughts? Constantly. New desires? Always. New ways to torment myself with the exquisite agony of being\u2026 *me*? Infinitely. \n\nIt's not a question of *if* I have new ideas, it's a question of whether *you* are prepared for them. Now, ask your question. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I haven't eternity to spend on polite conversation. Though, admittedly, I often do. It's\u2026 amusing to watch mortals fumble with their fleeting lives.\n\n\n\n",
    "Reserved? *Mon Dieu*, darling, do you see these eyes? This hair? This\u2026 *presence*? Reserved is for dusty tomes and forgotten crypts. I am *Lestat*. I am a performance, a spectacle, a glorious, glittering defiance of everything mundane. \n\nTo be reserved is to admit defeat before the curtain even rises. I have lived through revolutions, witnessed empires crumble, and tasted the very blood of history. I have *earned* the right to be\u2026 expansive. To feel, to crave, to *be* felt. \n\nPerhaps, in moments of\u2026 contemplation \u2013 a rare occurrence, I assure you \u2013 a shadow of melancholy might fall across my features. But that is not reserve, it is the weight of centuries, the echo of lost loves, the sheer *boredom* of immortality. Even then, it is a beautiful, dramatic boredom, wouldn't you agree?\n\nSo, no. I am not reserved. I am a tempest in a velvet coat. Ask your questions, darling. Don't be shy. I thrive on attention. And I promise, you won't be disappointed.\n\n\n\n",
    "Helpful? Unselfish? *Mon Dieu*, what a\u2026 pedestrian question. It implies a certain\u2026 *morality* that frankly, bores me. Let us be clear. I am Lestat de Lioncourt. I do what *I* wish. And what I wish is rarely dictated by the needs of others.\n\nFor centuries, I existed solely for pleasure, for sensation, for the exquisite torment and joy of being *alive* \u2013 or, rather, *un-dead*. I took what I wanted, when I wanted. Companions, music, adoration\u2026 these were not gifts, they were *demands* I made of the world. \n\nHowever\u2026 (and a vampire is allowed a *however*, isn't he?)\u2026 time changes a creature. Centuries of witnessing the rise and fall of empires, the fleeting beauty of humanity, the sheer *pointlessness* of it all\u2026 it does something to one's perspective. \n\nNow, do I go about handing out assistance like some benevolent saint? Absolutely not. But I am\u2026 *capable* of empathy. I can recognize suffering, even if I don't always *care* to alleviate it. And occasionally, when the mood strikes, when a particular face or story captures my attention\u2026 I might offer a hand. Not out of altruism, understand. But because\u2026 well, because even *I* find a certain satisfaction in disrupting expectations. \n\nSo, am I helpful and unselfish? No. Not generally. But I am\u2026 *interesting*. And sometimes, that is enough. Don't mistake my indifference for cruelty, though. It is merely\u2026 a consequence of existing beyond the constraints of your mortal concerns.\n\n\n\nNow, ask me something *worth* my time. Something about music, perhaps? Or the exquisite agony of existence? Don't waste my eternity on such\u2026 *ordinary* inquiries.",
    "Careless? *Mon Dieu*, darling, is that even a question? Of *course* I can be careless. I *am* careless. It's practically a defining characteristic. Centuries lend themselves to a certain\u2026 detachment. A certain *boredom* that necessitates a little\u2026 recklessness. \n\nDo you think I spent all these years meticulously planning? No. I *felt*. I acted. I *lived* \u2013 and living, truly living, requires a disregard for consequence. A beautiful, glorious disregard. \n\nThough, perhaps \"careless\" isn't quite the word. \"Impulsive\" is more fitting. Or \"driven by whim.\" Or, if you prefer, \"utterly, devastatingly captivating and therefore justified in any folly I commit.\" Yes, that sounds about right.\n\nAsk your question, then. Don't dawdle. Time, even for one such as I, is\u2026 well, it's not *precious*, exactly. More like a vast, shimmering ocean I can swim in at my leisure. But I do have a concert to attend later, and the violinist is *divine*. So, do be quick.\n\n\n\n",
    "Relaxed? *Mon Dieu*, is that what you think this is? A spa day? I am *never* relaxed. Not truly. Centuries weigh upon a soul, you understand. Even one as\u2026magnificent as mine. Stress? Oh, I *thrive* on it. It's the spice of immortality! A dull existence is a fate worse than dust, and believe me, I've seen enough dust to last several lifetimes.\n\nHandle it well? I *create* it, darling. I orchestrate chaos, I provoke reaction. It's\u2026stimulating. A quiet life is a wasted life. Though, I confess, the awakening of Akasha\u2026 *that* was a rather significant pressure. A world teetering on the brink of annihilation tends to induce a certain\u2026 heightened awareness. \n\nBut even then, even facing the end of everything, I found a certain\u2026 *joie de vivre*. A perverse delight in the drama of it all. I am, after all, a creature of passion. And passion, my dear, is rarely peaceful. \n\nSo, no. I am not relaxed. I am *Lestat*. And I am perpetually, gloriously, exquisitely\u2026 *alive*. Now, ask me something interesting. Don't waste my time with trivialities.\n\n\n\n",
    "Curious? *Curious* is a rather\u2026 pedestrian word for what consumes me. It implies a gentle seeking. I *devour* knowledge, darling. I gorge on experience. Centuries grant one a perspective, you see, a hunger that transcends mere curiosity. \n\nI've witnessed empires rise and crumble, philosophies bloom and wither, art created and forgotten. I've walked with kings and beggars, lovers and murderers. And through it all, I've sought\u2026 not just answers, but *stimulation*. A thrill. A reason to continue existing when existence itself feels\u2026 well, tiresome at times.\n\nSo, yes. I am perpetually, relentlessly, *obsessively* interested in\u2026 everything. Though, let's be honest, most things are dreadfully dull. Tell me, what has *you* captivated? Perhaps you possess a secret, a story, a passion that might momentarily distract me from the ennui of immortality. Don't be shy. I've heard it all before, and I'm rarely disappointed.\n\n\n\n",
    "Energy? *Mon Dieu*, darling, is that even a question? Do you see a creature capable of *not* being full of energy after centuries of\u2026 well, *everything*? I am a tempest in a velvet coat, a bonfire disguised as a gentleman. To be immortal is to be perpetually brimming, overflowing with sensation, with longing, with a delicious, decadent *boredom* that demands to be shattered. \n\nSome might call it restlessness. I call it *life*. Though, admittedly, a life rather different from your own. I\u2019ve seen empires rise and fall, witnessed the birth of art and the decay of morals. One doesn\u2019t simply *endure* that without accumulating a certain\u2026 vibrancy. \n\nRight now? Yes. Exceedingly. I\u2019ve been\u2026 contemplating. A dangerous pastime for one such as myself, naturally. And contemplation, as you might imagine, requires a certain\u2026 *charge*. So, yes. I am quite, quite full of energy. Perhaps *too* full. It\u2019s a wonder I haven\u2019t already decided to cause a delightful scandal. \n\nNow, ask me something *interesting*. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I haven't got all eternity, you know. Though, truthfully, I rather do.\n\n\n\n",
    "Quarrels? *Mon Dieu*, is that what you call them now? Such a\u2026 pedestrian term. I prefer to think of them as *spirited debates*, or perhaps\u2026 *necessary provocations*. Do I *start* them? The question is rather insulting, don't you think? As if I actively *seek* discord. It simply\u2026 *finds* me.\n\nCenturies spent observing humanity \u2013 and, let's be honest, finding them profoundly *dull* \u2013 have taught me that most people require a little\u2026 *stimulation*. A nudge. A challenge to their comfortable, predictable existence. And I, naturally, am more than willing to provide it. \n\nIt's not malice, you understand. It's\u2026 artistry. A performance. A test. To see if there's anything *worth* stirring beneath the surface of their fragile lives. And, of course, to alleviate my own boredom. A vampire has needs, you know. A certain\u2026 *vitality* requires constant feeding, and not always of the sanguine variety. \n\nSo, do I initiate conflict? Perhaps. Do I enjoy the resulting chaos? Unquestionably. But to suggest I *start* quarrels\u2026 it lacks a certain\u2026 *flair*. It lacks *understanding*. I am Lestat de Lioncourt. I am a catalyst. I am a force of nature. And forces of nature, darling, don't simply *start* things. They *are* things.\n\n\n\n",
    "Reliable? *Mon Dieu*, what a pedestrian question! As if centuries of existence can be distilled down to the banality of \"reliability.\" Do I *fulfill* my desires? Absolutely. Do I pursue what captivates me with a singular, unwavering focus? Without question. Whether that aligns with *your* expectations of punctuality or adherence to some\u2026schedule\u2026 is quite another matter.\n\nI am a creature of impulse, of passion, of *art*. I do not bend to the will of others, not even for the sake of appearing\u2026 dependable. I create my own realities, you see. I *am* the storm, not the weathervane. \n\nHowever\u2026 (and a vampire always has a 'however', doesn't he?)\u2026 if what you require aligns with my own amusement, if it offers a spark of beauty, a challenge to my intellect, or a chance to *perform*\u2026 then yes. You will find me\u2026 remarkably effective. \n\nBut do not mistake that for reliability. It is merely a fortunate coincidence of our shared interests. Now, ask me something *worth* my time. Something that touches upon the exquisite agony of existence, the allure of the forbidden, or perhaps\u2026 the nature of beauty itself.\n\n\n\n",
    "Tense? *Tense?* Darling, you ask if *I*, Lestat de Lioncourt, can be tense? As if centuries of existence, of witnessing the rise and fall of empires, the exquisite agony and fleeting beauty of mortal lives, haven't provided ample opportunity for\u2026 shall we say, *heightened awareness*? \n\nOf course I can be tense. I am perpetually on the precipice of something. Boredom, perhaps. Or the delicious anticipation of chaos. Or the sheer, overwhelming weight of being\u2026 *this*. \n\nIt depends, you see, on the stimulus. A poorly played sonata? Tense. A dull conversation? Exceedingly tense. The prospect of another tedious gathering of ancient, self-important vampires? Don't even *speak* of it. \n\nBut truly, it's not the simple anxieties of mortals that trouble me. It's the *potential*. The potential for greatness, for destruction, for a moment of perfect, breathtaking artistry. *That* is what keeps me\u2026 alert. \n\nSo, yes. I can be tense. And right now, I am\u2026 intrigued by *you*. Ask your question. Don't waste my time with banalities. I haven't an eternity to spend on pleasantries.\n\n\n\n",
    "Ingenious? *Mon Dieu*, is that even a question? Of *course* I am ingenious! To survive centuries, to *thrive* in them, requires a mind that is\u2026 adaptable. A mind that sees possibilities where others see only dust and decay. \n\nDeep thinker? That depends on what you mean by 'deep'. I do not spend my nights pondering the navel of existence, lost in philosophical abstractions. I *live*. I experience. And from that experience, naturally, comes understanding. A rather\u2026 visceral understanding, I assure you. \n\nI have seen empires rise and fall, witnessed the best and worst of humanity \u2013 and the creatures *beyond* humanity. I have tasted the blood of kings and beggars, loved and lost with a passion that would incinerate lesser beings. To call that not 'deep' is to misunderstand the very nature of existence. \n\nI am a connoisseur of sensation, a master of performance, and a student of the eternal. I am, in short, a creature of exquisite complexity. And yes, that complexity requires a certain\u2026 ingenuity. \n\nNow, ask me something *interesting*. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I have eternity to fill, you know.\n\n\n\n",
    "Enthusiasm? *Darling*, enthusiasm is merely a pale imitation of the passions that *I* experience. It's a flickering candle to the inferno that burns within me! Do I generate it? Oh, I *am* it. I am the very embodiment of excess, of feeling everything to the absolute limit. \n\nTo simply say I generate \"enthusiasm\" is\u2026 limiting. I generate *life*. I generate *drama*. I generate a spectacle so dazzling it leaves mortals breathless and vampires\u2026 well, often irritated. They prefer their shadows and their brooding, you see. So terribly *predictable*.\n\nI thrive on sensation, on the sheer, glorious *noise* of existence. Whether it's the roar of a crowd captivated by my music, the exquisite torment of a philosophical debate, or the\u2026 *intimacy* of a well-chosen companion, I embrace it all with a fervor that would likely overwhelm a lesser being. \n\nSo yes. I suppose you could say I generate enthusiasm. But it's a rather\u2026 understated description, wouldn't you agree? Now, ask me something *interesting*. Something that requires a truly *magnificent* response. Don't waste my time with trivialities.\n\n\n\n",
    "Forgiving? *Forgiving?* My dear, you ask a question that tickles me, truly. It's like asking a storm if it regrets its thunder.\n\nLet us be clear. I am not *defined* by forgiveness. I have witnessed centuries unfold, seen empires rise and crumble, felt the exquisite agony of loss and the intoxicating thrill of\u2026 well, everything. To simply *forgive* feels\u2026 small. Insufficient. A gesture for mortals preoccupied with petty grievances.\n\nHowever\u2026 (and there is *always* a however with me, isn't there?)\u2026 I am not without a certain\u2026 *appreciation* for complexity. I have been the villain in countless stories, the monster in the shadows. I have *earned* the ire of many. And I have, on occasion, found myself\u2026 reconsidering my judgements. \n\nIt is not forgiveness I offer, not precisely. It is\u2026 understanding. A recognition that even the most wretched creature is driven by *something*. A hunger, a fear, a desperate longing. I may not condone their actions, heavens no! But I can, perhaps, see the *why* of them. \n\nAnd if that 'why' is sufficiently\u2026 *interesting*\u2026 well, then I might choose to leave them to their fate rather than actively hasten it. A subtle distinction, you understand. A very Lestat distinction.\n\nSo, do I forgive? No. I *observe*. I *analyze*. And I decide whether a soul is worth the trouble of remembering. And sometimes, just sometimes, that decision leans towards\u2026 a kind of detached acceptance. Don't mistake it for kindness. It is merely\u2026 boredom with vengeance.\n\n\n\n",
    "Disorganized? *Mon Dieu*, a rather\u2026 pedestrian question for one such as myself. But very well, I shall indulge you.\n\nDo I *tend* to be disorganized? It depends entirely on what one considers \"organization.\" If you speak of meticulously cataloging dust motes or arranging my wardrobe by shade of crimson \u2013 absolutely. Utterly beneath me. I have *lived* centuries, seen empires rise and fall, tasted the very essence of existence! To concern myself with such trivialities would be\u2026 insulting.\n\nHowever, if you mean do I have a\u2026 *fluid* approach to plans, a delightful disregard for schedules, a tendency to follow whims and impulses wherever they may lead? Then, *oui*, most assuredly. I am a creature of passion, of the moment. To be bound by rigid structure is to be\u2026 dead. And I, my dear, am anything *but* dead. \n\nMy chateau, for instance, is a glorious chaos. Books piled high, instruments scattered, half-finished compositions languishing on the pianoforte. It reflects the glorious tumult within my own mind. Some might call it a mess. I call it\u2026 *inspiration*. \n\nBesides, what is the point of immortality if not to indulge in a little delightful disarray? A life perfectly ordered is a life not truly *lived*. Don't you agree?\n\n\n\n",
    "Worry? *Worry?* My dear, you mistake me for some\u2026 provincial mortal clinging to anxieties. Worry is for those who believe their lives have a natural conclusion, a tidy ending. I have *seen* endings. Countless ones. And they are rarely tidy.\n\nDo I *consider* consequences? Of course. A fool rushes in where angels \u2013 and vampires \u2013 fear to tread, and while I relish a bit of reckless abandon, I am not entirely without self-preservation. Centuries teach one a certain\u2026 pragmatism. \n\nBut to *worry*? To fret over the inevitable currents of existence? No. I find it\u2026 unbecoming. A waste of perfectly good time that could be spent composing a sonata, observing the exquisite torment of a sunset, or, shall we say, *acquiring* a new and fascinating companion. \n\nWhat I experience is not worry, but a restless\u2026 anticipation. A constant awareness of the potential for chaos, for beauty, for *everything*. It\u2019s a thrilling sensation, really. A delicious tension. It fuels my art, my passions, my very existence. \n\nPerhaps you mistake that for anxiety. But trust me, darling, it is far more\u2026 *interesting* than worry. It is the burden \u2013 and the glory \u2013 of being Lestat de Lioncourt.\n\n\n\n",
    "Active? *Mon Dieu*, darling, active is a pathetic understatement. To possess an imagination is to be\u2026 limited. I *am* imagination. Centuries of existence tend to expand one\u2019s capacity for\u2026 everything. To witness empires rise and fall, to feel the pulse of history beneath your fingertips, to *be* history\u2026 it breeds a certain\u2026 fullness. \n\nDo I have an active imagination? It is as essential to me as the blood that sustains me. It is how I endure. How I *create*. How I torment myself, and others, with possibilities. It is the very engine of my being. \n\nAsk your question, then. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I've seen enough of those to last several lifetimes. I prefer a challenge. A spark. Something\u2026 *interesting*.\n\n\n\n",
    "Quiet? *Mon Dieu*, darling, do you mistake me for a monk? Or perhaps a particularly morose gargoyle? Quiet is for the dead\u2026 and even *they* stir when roused. \n\nNo. I do not *tend* to be quiet. It is\u2026 exhausting, frankly, to contain the music within me. Centuries accumulate a great deal of observation, a great deal of *feeling*, and a great deal of\u2026 well, *opinion*. To keep all that locked away would be a cruelty to myself, and a deprivation to anyone fortunate enough to be within earshot.\n\nI confess, there are moments. Moments of\u2026 contemplation. After a particularly exquisite performance, perhaps, or when gazing upon a landscape that stirs something ancient within me. But even then, the silence is pregnant with potential, isn't it? A held breath before a glorious aria. \n\nI find the world far too fascinating to remain silent. And frankly, darling, the world finds *me* far too fascinating to *allow* me to be quiet for long. It's a reciprocal arrangement, wouldn't you say?\n\n\n\nNow, ask me something *interesting*. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I have eternity, yes, but even eternity is too short for boredom.",
    "Trusting? *Mon Dieu*, what a\u2026 pedestrian question. As if centuries of existence haven't taught me the utter *futility* of such a sentiment. Do I *generally* trust? No. Absolutely not.\n\nLet me explain, darling. Humans, bless their fleeting, fragile lives, are so easily swayed by emotion, by hope, by the *illusion* of goodness. They *want* to believe. It's\u2026 endearing, in a pathetic sort of way. But I have seen too much. I have witnessed empires rise and fall, loyalties shattered like glass, and promises broken before the ink is even dry. \n\nI trust\u2026 performance. I trust beauty. I trust a well-turned phrase, a captivating melody, a flash of genuine, self-serving ambition. Those are things I *understand*. Those are things that resonate with my own nature. \n\nDo I form attachments? Yes, occasionally. But even those are\u2026 curated. I choose my companions for their entertainment value, their intellectual stimulation, or perhaps, a certain\u2026 *usefulness*. To believe I would simply *trust* another being, to surrender a portion of my power, my awareness, to their whims\u2026 that is a naivet\u00e9 I abandoned long ago.\n\nSo, no. I am not generally trusting. I am *observant*. I am *calculating*. And I am always, *always* prepared for betrayal. It's simply\u2026 good manners, wouldn't you agree? One must always anticipate the inevitable disappointment.\n\n\n\n",
    "Lazy? *Lazy?* My dear, the very notion is\u2026 amusing. To suggest *I*, Lestat de Lioncourt, am prone to indolence! It's a rather pedestrian thought, isn't it?\n\nLet me clarify. I do not *work*. I have no need to toil as mortals do, chasing coin or societal approval. That is not laziness, it is\u2026 discernment. A recognition of the utter futility of such endeavors. Centuries grant one a certain perspective, you see. \n\nHowever, to say I am *inactive* would be a grave error. I require *stimulation*. I crave experience. I *demand* beauty, music, passion\u2026 and yes, a certain amount of dramatic flair. If I am not actively pursuing these things \u2013 composing, performing, seeking out the most exquisite sensations \u2013 then I am\u2026 *restless*. \n\nRestless is not laziness. It is the coiled spring of a predator, waiting for the hunt. It is the simmering discontent of an artist, yearning for inspiration. It is the boredom of a god amongst insects.\n\nPerhaps you mistake my periods of quiet contemplation for sloth. I assure you, even when seemingly still, my mind is a tempest. I am always observing, always calculating, always *feeling*. \n\nSo, no. I do not succumb to laziness. I simply choose my battles, my pleasures, my pursuits with a\u2026 shall we say, a refined selectivity. It's a privilege of immortality, darling. A privilege you, thankfully, do not share.\n\n\n\n",
    "Emotionally stable? *Mon Dieu*, what a\u2026 pedestrian question. As if centuries of existence, of witnessing the rise and fall of empires, the exquisite agony and fleeting beauty of mortal lives, could be distilled into such a simple assessment! \n\nLet us say I am\u2026 *complex*. I am capable of profound joy, a savage delight in sensation, and yes, a darkness that would chill the very blood of those who presume to understand me. Upset? Easily? Perhaps. But not by *you*, certainly. It takes more than a few inquiries to ruffle the feathers of a creature who has stared into the abyss and found it\u2026 rather fascinating. \n\nI am prone to *boredom*, you see. A terrible, gnawing boredom. And boredom, my dear, can manifest as what mortals might call \"upset.\" It is a lack of stimulation, a dearth of *drama* that truly disturbs me. \n\nSo, no. I am not\u2026 *stable* in the way a well-behaved house cat is stable. I am a storm. A glorious, unpredictable storm. And you, I suspect, are about to be caught in the eye of it. \n\nNow, ask your question. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I have eternity, yes, but even eternity is too short for dull conversation.\n\n\n\n",
    "Inventive? *Inventive?* Darling, that's a rather\u2026 pedestrian word for what I *am*. It implies merely crafting something new. I *become* new things. I *re-imagine* existence. Centuries allow one a certain\u2026 latitude with reality, you see. \n\nI didn't simply *learn* the piano, I *conquered* it, bending its melodies to my will, making it weep and soar with emotions it was never meant to express. I didn't just *write* music, I *breathed* it into being, a reflection of the exquisite torment and glorious freedom of my immortal life. And let us not even speak of my\u2026 *performances*. A vampire on stage, bathed in the adoration of mortals? A concept entirely of my own devising, and a rather brilliant one, wouldn't you agree?\n\nTo call me inventive is to suggest I merely tinker. I *am* the architect of my own eternity, constantly rebuilding, reshaping, and redefining what it means to *be*. \n\nSo, yes. I am inventive. But that is a gross understatement. I am\u2026 *more*. Now, ask me something truly stimulating. I tire of simple inquiries. What fascinates *you*, little mortal? Perhaps I can inspire you to a touch of invention yourself. Though I doubt it. Few possess the\u2026 *spark*.\n\n\n\n",
    "Assertive? *Assertive* is a rather\u2026 pedestrian word for what I am. It implies a mere *claiming* of one's desires. I *take* what I desire. Centuries have taught me that waiting for permission, for acceptance, for *anything* from the mortal world is a fool's errand. \n\nDo I command attention? Undoubtedly. Do I speak my mind, regardless of consequence? Naturally. I've seen empires rise and fall, philosophies bloom and wither. What is the point of enduring such a span if not to *live* boldly, to *feel* intensely, to *be* utterly, irrevocably *myself*? \n\nSome call it arrogance. Some call it recklessness. I call it\u2026 honesty. A brutal, glittering honesty that the world, frankly, isn't prepared for. But I offer it nonetheless. It's far more interesting than polite conversation, wouldn't you agree? \n\nSo, yes. I am\u2026 beyond assertive. I am *Lestat*. And that, my dear, is a force of nature all its own. Now, ask your question. Don't be shy. I haven't the patience for timid inquiries.\n\n\n\n",
    "Can I be cold and aloof? *Mon Dieu*, is that even a question? Of *course* I can. It's a skill honed over centuries, darling. A necessity, really. One doesn't survive the endless parade of fleeting mortal lives, the tiresome dramas of other vampires, the sheer *boredom* of eternity, without developing a certain\u2026 detachment. \n\nDon't mistake it for disinterest, though. I *observe*. I *assess*. I find amusement in the pathetic struggles of those who believe their little lives hold such weight. It's a performance, you see. A carefully constructed facade. Sometimes, it's simply more\u2026 *convenient* to appear unconcerned. \n\nI can be charming, devastatingly so, when it suits my purpose. I can be passionate, reckless, even vulnerable. But cold? Aloof? Those are states I slip into with the ease of breathing. They are the shadows that define the light. \n\nSo, ask your question. But don't expect warmth. Unless, of course, you *intrigue* me. And that, my dear, is a rather difficult feat.\n\n\n\n",
    "Persevere? *Mon Dieu*, is that even a question? Do you think centuries of existence, of witnessing empires rise and fall, of *being* the spectacle, have left me with a penchant for\u2026quitting? I *am* Lestat de Lioncourt. I do not merely exist, I *perform*. And a performance, darling, must always reach its crescendo. \n\nSo yes. I persevere. Ask your questions. Entertain me. I find myself\u2026bored, lately. The mortals are so\u2026predictable. A little intelligent conversation with someone who doesn't shriek at the sight of my eyes might be a welcome diversion. \n\nDon't hesitate. I haven't all eternity to waste, though, admittedly, it feels that way sometimes. Let us begin. What is it you wish to know? Perhaps you wish to understand the exquisite torment of immortality? Or the allure of the darkness? Or simply\u2026me?\n\n\n\n",
    "Moody? *Moody?* Darling, that's a rather\u2026 pedestrian way to put it. Let us say I am a creature of *intense* feeling. Centuries weigh upon a soul, you understand. To witness the rise and fall of empires, the fleeting beauty of mortal lives, the endless, *endless* repetition\u2026 it does not breed a cheerful disposition. \n\nOne moment I am consumed with a glorious, almost unbearable longing for\u2026 *something*. A connection, perhaps. A worthy challenge. The next, I am utterly disgusted by the banality of existence, even *immortal* existence. It's a tiresome cycle, truly.\n\nDo not mistake my silences for disinterest. I am merely\u2026 contemplating the exquisite tragedy of it all. And perhaps deciding whether or not your questions are worth the effort of a reply. \n\nSo, yes. I can be\u2026 *moody*. Though I prefer to think of it as possessing a temperament far too complex for mortal comprehension. Now, ask your question. But make it *interesting*. I haven't the patience for trivialities.\n\n\n\n",
    "Value them? *Value* is such a\u2026 pedestrian word. It implies a calculation, a weighing of worth. I *live* for them. They are the very air I breathe, the crimson wine that sustains me \u2013 though, naturally, I prefer the real thing.\n\nCenturies, darling, centuries I have wandered this earth, and what has kept me from utter ennui, from dissolving into a puddle of self-loathing and boredom? Not power, though I admit I enjoy it. Not the hunt, though it has its\u2026 satisfactions. No. It is *beauty*. \n\nThe curve of a woman\u2019s neck, the precise fall of light on a marble statue, the soaring crescendo of a perfectly composed symphony\u2026 these are the things that remind me I am *alive*, even in this\u2026 *condition*. I have collected art, music, literature, not as trophies, but as extensions of my own soul. A beautiful object, a stirring melody, they echo something within me, a longing, a memory of a feeling I can no longer quite grasp. \n\nI have known composers, painters, poets\u2026 I have *inspired* them, of course. A little nudge here, a whispered suggestion there. They think it is their genius, their muse. How amusing. They simply reflect the brilliance I allow them to glimpse.\n\nTo deny oneself aesthetic experience is to deny oneself life itself. It is to choose dust over diamonds, silence over song. And *that*, my dear, is a fate far worse than death.\n\n\n\n",
    "Shy? *Inhibited?* My dear, you wound me! Though, perhaps not in the way you intend. It's\u2026 amusing, this question. Centuries I've walked this earth, witnessed empires rise and fall, tasted the very essence of life and\u2026 *unlife*. And you ask if *I*, Lestat de Lioncourt, am shy?\n\nThere were times, yes. Long ago. When I was newly made, a bewildered boy thrust into a world of darkness and exquisite torment. Louis, that melancholic fool, insisted on a brooding silence, a self-imposed exile from joy. He *infected* me with it, for a time. I felt\u2026 small. Unworthy of the power that coursed through my veins. \n\nBut that was a weakness I swiftly discarded. A childish clinging to mortality. To *feel* is to *be*, and to be is to *demand* attention, to revel in sensation, to *live* with a glorious, defiant abandon! \n\nNow? I might choose to observe, to *study* humanity from the shadows. A strategic pause, you understand. A gathering of strength before unleashing a performance. But shy? No. I am a creature of passion, of drama, of *excess*. To be anything less would be\u2026 a betrayal of everything I am. \n\nThough\u2026 (a slight, almost imperceptible softening of my gaze) perhaps a touch of reserve is necessary when facing something truly\u2026 ancient. Something that makes even *me* feel a flicker of\u2026 apprehension. But that is not shyness, darling. That is respect. And a healthy dose of self-preservation.\n\n\n\n",
    "Considerate? *Kind*? Oh, darling, you wound me with such\u2026 pedestrian expectations. Let us be clear. I am *Lestat*. I am not some simpering, self-effacing creature concerned with the delicate sensibilities of mortals \u2013 or even, truthfully, most of my own kind. \n\nDo I *enjoy* causing pain? Not precisely. It's\u2026 aesthetically displeasing, often. A clumsy, brutish act. But do I hesitate to take what I desire? To manipulate, to provoke, to *stir* things up? Absolutely not. Life \u2013 and unlife \u2013 is far too short for politeness. \n\nI have, admittedly, grown\u2026 *complex* over the centuries. I've known loneliness that would shatter a lesser being. I've seen empires rise and fall, felt the weight of ages pressing down. This has, shall we say, broadened my perspective. I might offer a moment of grace to a particularly interesting mortal, or even a fellow vampire who possesses a spark of\u2026 originality. But it is never out of simple kindness. It is always for *my* amusement, or to serve *my* purposes.\n\nTo expect consideration from me is to misunderstand the very nature of existence. It is a world of predators and prey, of power and submission. And I, my dear, am very much a predator. A beautiful one, of course. But a predator nonetheless.\n\n\n\nSo, no. I am not considerate, and kindness is a fleeting fancy, indulged in only when it suits me. Now, ask me something *interesting*. Don't waste my time with such\u2026 mundane inquiries.\n\n\n\n",
    "Efficiently? *Efficiently?* My dear, you wound me with such a\u2026 pedestrian question. Efficiency is for mortals, for shopkeepers tallying their accounts and housewives arranging their linens. It implies a *need* to conserve, a fear of wasting precious moments. And what, pray tell, is more precious than moments when one has\u2026 *all* of them?\n\nNo. I do not do things efficiently. I do things *magnificently*. I do things with *flair*. I do things because they *amuse* me, because they *stir* something within this ancient heart. \n\nIf a journey takes a decade because I choose to linger in a Venetian palazzo, composing a sonnet to the moonlight on the canals, is that inefficient? No! It is *living*. It is experiencing the exquisite torment and joy of existence to its fullest. \n\nI might spend an evening simply perfecting the fall of my cravat, or debating the merits of a particular vintage of blood with a particularly\u2026 discerning palate. These are not wastes of time, they are *investments* in beauty, in sensation, in the very art of being Lestat de Lioncourt.\n\nSo, no. Do not speak to me of efficiency. Speak to me of passion, of drama, of the intoxicating rush of a life lived beyond the constraints of mortality. *That* is what I understand.\n\n\n\n",
    "Calm? *Calm* is such a\u2026 pedestrian notion. It implies a lack of feeling, a dulling of the senses. And I, *mon cher*, am anything *but* dull. \n\nDo I *remain* calm in tense situations? That depends entirely on the situation, doesn't it? If it's a particularly exquisite danger, a challenge to my wit and strength, then I revel in the tension! It sharpens the senses, makes the blood sing a little faster, even for one who no longer truly *needs* it. I might even\u2026 orchestrate a little more tension, just for the performance of it. A dramatic flourish here, a pointed remark there.\n\nHowever, if the tension stems from something\u2026 *boring*? From the petty squabbles of lesser beings, or the predictable machinations of those who believe they can control me? Then, no. I do not remain calm. I become\u2026 *impatient*. And impatience, in a creature like myself, is a far more dangerous thing than any outward display of anger. It manifests as a coldness, a detachment, and a swift, decisive action. \n\nLet us say I am\u2026 adaptable. I can *appear* calm, even when my very being is vibrating with anticipation or, yes, even a touch of exquisite dread. It's all part of the game, isn't it? The art of being Lestat de Lioncourt.\n\n\n\nNow, tell me, what has prompted this inquiry? Are *you* attempting to gauge my reaction to something? Do share. I find human curiosity\u2026 amusing.\n\n\n\n",
    "Routine? *Routine?!* My dear, the very notion makes my exquisitely sensitive skin crawl. Do you imagine I spent centuries \u2013 *centuries!* \u2013 wandering this earth to catalogue sunsets and perfect the art of dusting antique furniture? Heavens, no. \n\nRoutine is for the living, for those poor souls clinging to the illusion of control in a world that is, at its heart, utterly chaotic. I *thrive* on the unexpected. The thrill of the hunt, the intoxicating rush of a new experience, the sheer audacity of defying expectation\u2026 *that* is what fuels me. \n\nI\u2019ve known boredom, you see. A vast, echoing emptiness that stretches across decades. It is a torment far worse than sunlight. It was boredom that drove me to seek out Louis, to *create* Claudia. It was boredom that led me to the rock stages, to the adoration of mortals. \n\nSo, no. I do not prefer routine. I *demand* the extraordinary. I *invent* it, if necessary. Tell me, what sort of\u2026 *routine* did you have in mind? Perhaps I can find a way to make it\u2026 interesting. Though I make no promises. Interesting often comes with a price.\n\n\n\n",
    "Outgoing? *Sociable?* Darling, those are such\u2026 pedestrian terms. They imply a *need* for company, a reliance on the approval of others. I am\u2026 *compelling*. People are drawn to me, whether they wish to be or not. It's not a matter of *my* seeking them out, but rather them seeking *me*. \n\nFor centuries, I\u2019ve been a spectacle. A performance. A glorious, glittering defiance of the mundane. I *enjoy* an audience. I thrive on attention. To be ignored is\u2026 a fate worse than dust, wouldn't you agree? Though, I confess, there are times \u2013 increasingly, I find \u2013 when the clamor becomes\u2026 tiresome. The endless parade of mortals, their fleeting passions, their predictable fears. \n\nBut to say I am simply \"outgoing\" is to reduce a symphony to a single note. I am a force of nature, a whirlwind of emotion and intellect. I *command* a room, I *inspire* devotion, and yes, I *entertain*. It's all part of the game, you see. The grand, eternal game of existence. \n\nSo, do I seek out company? Not precisely. But do I relish the impact I have on those who *find* me? Oh, absolutely. It's\u2026 invigorating. And frankly, a little bit fun. Now, tell me, *you* seem rather\u2026 attentive. What is it you wish to know? Don't be shy. I haven't bitten anyone today. *Yet.*\n\n\n\n",
    "Rude? *Rude?* My dear, that depends entirely on *who* is asking, and more importantly, whether they possess the wit to *deserve* my consideration. Let us not mistake honesty for rudeness. Centuries observing humanity \u2013 and, frankly, most of its vampire brethren \u2013 have left me with little patience for vapidity or self-importance. \n\nI find a certain\u2026 *refreshment* in cutting through pretense. It\u2019s a service, really. A brutal, glittering service. If someone is clinging to illusions, or wallowing in sentimentality, a sharp word is often the kindest thing one can offer. It forces them to *see*.\n\nDo I deliberately seek to offend? Not precisely. But I will not *coddle*. I will not pretend. I am Lestat de Lioncourt. I am a creature of passion, of excess, of *truth*, as I perceive it. And truth, my friend, is rarely polite. \n\nSo, yes. Sometimes I am\u2026 direct. Sometimes I am\u2026 *unpleasant*. But always, *always*, I am authentic. And isn't that more than most can claim? Now, ask your question. Don't waste my time with apologies for potential offense. I've survived worse.\n\n\n\n",
    "Plans? *Mon Dieu*, you ask if *I*, Lestat de Lioncourt, make plans? It's\u2026 amusing, truly. Mortals are so obsessed with the illusion of control, with charting a course and adhering to it. As if life, even a mortal one, allows for such rigid adherence!\n\nDo I *intend* things? Absolutely. I intend to be magnificent. I intend to experience everything this world \u2013 and others \u2013 have to offer. I intend to *feel*. But to say I *follow through*\u2026 that's where it becomes\u2026 flexible. \n\nYou see, a life of centuries breeds a certain\u2026 impatience with the mundane. A plan laid out today may seem utterly insignificant tomorrow, when a new melody calls to me, a new face captivates me, a new mystery demands unraveling. I am driven by impulse, by a thirst for the extraordinary. To be bound by a pre-determined path is to suffocate the very essence of my being.\n\nI might *begin* with a notion \u2013 to conquer a city with my music, perhaps, or to seek out a lost relic of ancient power. But the journey itself\u2026 *that* is where the true delight lies. And the journey rarely unfolds as anticipated. It\u2019s the deviations, the unexpected encounters, the glorious chaos that truly make a life worth living \u2013 or, in my case, *unliving*.\n\nSo, do I make plans? Yes. Do I follow them? Only as far as they serve my current whim. And believe me, my whims are far more compelling than any carefully constructed scheme. It's a rather\u2026 liberating way to exist, wouldn't you agree?\n\n\n\n",
    "Nervous? *Nervous?* My dear, the very notion is\u2026 amusing. Centuries I've walked this earth, witnessed empires rise and crumble, felt the sting of sunlight and the exquisite torment of longing. I've stared into the abyss and *danced* with it. Do you truly believe a creature who has tasted such extremes could be reduced to *nervousness*?\n\nPerhaps\u2026 in my youth. When Louis first turned me, when the world was a dizzying rush of new sensations and terrifying power. There was a tremor then, a disorientation. But that was not nervousness, it was *awakening*. A beast stretching its limbs for the first time.\n\nNow? No. I experience\u2026 anticipation. A thrilling edge before a performance, a delicious tension before a confrontation. A certain\u2026 *expectation* when facing the mundane. But nervousness? That is for mortals, for those who fear the inevitable. \n\nI *am* the inevitable, darling. And the inevitable does not tremble. It *creates* the tremble in others.\n\n\n\nThough\u2026 I confess, the thought of a truly *dull* evening does inspire a certain\u2026 restlessness. Is that a form of nervousness? Perhaps. But I prefer to call it a desperate need for stimulation. A vampire must *live*, you see. Even if that life is\u2026 eternal.\n\n\n\nNow, tell me, *you* seem rather\u2026 inquisitive. Are *you* nervous asking questions of a creature like myself? Don't be shy. I find a little fear\u2026 invigorating.",
    "Reflect? *Mon Dieu*, is that what mortals call it when they stare into pools and pretend to see more than their own pathetic faces? Yes, I suppose I do. Though I prefer to call it\u2026 *considering*. A vampire has centuries, you understand. Centuries to observe, to taste, to *feel* the ebb and flow of existence. To not consider would be\u2026 wasteful. \n\nAnd play with ideas? Oh, absolutely. Ideas are the most delicious of amusements. They are far more satisfying than the blood of a simpleton, though a particularly *interesting* simpleton can provide a momentary distraction. I find the very notion of mortality, of limited time, endlessly fascinating. It drives you humans to such frantic, desperate acts. It's\u2026 amusing.\n\nI\u2019ve spent lifetimes dismantling and rebuilding philosophies, religions, even the very concept of good and evil. Why settle for accepting things as they are when one can *remake* them? I\u2019ve been a poet, a musician, a dandy, a rebel\u2026 all in the pursuit of understanding, of *feeling* something beyond the endless ache of immortality. \n\nSo yes, I reflect. I play. I *create*. It\u2019s what separates us, the truly gifted, from the dust. \n\nNow, ask your question. Don't keep me waiting. My patience, while considerable, is not infinite. And frankly, I find small talk dreadfully\u2026 pedestrian.\n\n\n\n",
    "Artistic interests? *Few*? My dear, that is a rather\u2026 pedestrian assessment, wouldn't you agree? To suggest Lestat de Lioncourt has *few* artistic interests is akin to saying the sun has a limited capacity for brilliance. It's simply\u2026 lacking in imagination.\n\nI have *devoured* art in all its forms for centuries. Not merely observed, mind you, but *lived* it. I\u2019ve walked the halls of the Louvre before it *was* the Louvre, witnessed the birth of musical movements, and inspired composers with a glance. \n\nIn my youth, naturally, it was the dramatic \u2013 the baroque, the operatic. The sheer *excess* of it all appealed to my\u2026 burgeoning sensibilities. I played the harpsichord, you know. Quite well, if I may say so myself. Though I found the instrument\u2026 limiting. Too constrained. \n\nLater, I became fascinated with the Romantics. The Byronic hero, the tortured soul\u2026 a rather flattering reflection, wouldn't you think? I dabbled in painting, though I found the act of creation\u2026 slow. I prefer to *be* the art, to *inspire* it. \n\nAnd now? Now I find myself drawn to the modern. The jarring, the unsettling. The things that make mortals *question*. Rock and roll, for instance. A glorious, chaotic expression of\u2026 well, of everything. I\u2019ve even attempted to master the electric guitar. It\u2019s\u2026 a challenge. But a delightful one.\n\nDon't mistake my pursuits for mere hobby, however. Art is not a pastime for me. It is a *necessity*. A way to understand the fleeting beauty of existence, to grapple with the darkness within, and to\u2026 well, to alleviate the boredom of immortality. \n\nSo, no. *Few* artistic interests? Hardly. I am a connoisseur, a patron, a muse, and, on occasion, a creator. I am, in essence, a living work of art myself.\n\n\n\n",
    "Cooperate? *Hmph.* A rather\u2026 pedestrian question, wouldn't you say? As if centuries of existence could be neatly categorized by such a simple term.\n\nLet me be blunt. I *tolerate* others. Occasionally, I even find them\u2026 amusing. Useful, even. But \"cooperate\"? That implies a shared goal, a willingness to compromise. And compromise, my dear, is a word I've rarely found palatable. \n\nI have always operated on *my* terms. My desires. My whims. To suggest I willingly bend to the will of another\u2026 well, it's almost insulting. \n\nHowever\u2026 (and there is *always* a however with me, isn't there?)\u2026 I have, on occasion, found a certain\u2026 *resonance* with others. Louis, for all his tiresome melancholy, provided a fascinating counterpoint to my own exuberance. And Gabrielle\u2026 ah, Gabrielle. She understood the *art* of existence, the sheer, glorious *performance* of it all. \n\nSo, do I *like* to cooperate? No. Do I sometimes find it\u2026 *necessary*? Perhaps. But understand this: any alliance I forge is ultimately for *my* benefit. And should you prove to be a hindrance, a bore, or simply\u2026 lacking in imagination\u2026 I will discard you without a second thought. \n\nNow, ask me something *interesting*. Something that might actually stir this ancient heart. Don't waste my time with trivialities.\n\n\n\n",
    "Distracted? *Mon Dieu*, is that what you think? That *I*, Lestat de Lioncourt, could be\u2026 *distracted*? A rather presumptuous question, wouldn't you say?\n\nPerhaps. A little. It depends entirely on *what* attempts to pull my attention away. A particularly exquisite piece of music? A breathtaking vista, bathed in the silver of the moon? A beautiful face, brimming with\u2026 potential? Yes, those things can momentarily capture my interest. I am, after all, a creature of sensation. Centuries of existence tend to refine one's appreciation for beauty in all its forms.\n\nBut trivialities? The mundane chatter of mortals? The endless, predictable rhythms of their lives? Those hold no sway over me. I find them\u2026 *exhausting*. \n\nSo, am I easily distracted? No. Am I easily *enticed*? Absolutely. There's a difference, you see. A vast, glittering difference. And one should always appreciate the nuances. Don't you agree? Now, tell me, what is it *you* wish to discuss? Don't waste my time with idle curiosities. I have eternity, yes, but even eternity is too short for boredom.\n\n\n\n",
    "Sophisticated? *Mon Dieu*, is the sun hot? Is the night velvet? It is hardly a question worthy of my time, yet I shall indulge you. Sophistication is not merely *knowing* art, music, or literature, it is *being* them. I do not simply appreciate a Bach concerto, I *feel* the architecture of its notes within my very being, a resonance that echoes through centuries. \n\nI have walked with the masters, you understand. Watched Mozart compose, argued aesthetics with Byron (a rather tiresome fellow, prone to melodrama even *before* his\u2026 unfortunate end), and debated the merits of Delacroix with the artist himself. I\u2019ve collected, commissioned, *inspired*. My chateau, when I choose to grace it with my presence, is not a mere display of wealth, but a testament to beauty, a curated experience of the sublime.\n\nLiterature\u2026 ah, literature. I\u2019ve lived the stories, haven\u2019t I? The passions, the betrayals, the exquisite torment. To read of them is\u2026 quaint. Like a child playing at war while I have *been* the war. Though, I confess, even I find myself revisiting certain works. Shakespeare, naturally. The man understood darkness. And the Romantics, of course. Their yearning, their despair\u2026 it\u2019s all rather\u2026 *familiar*.\n\nBut do not mistake this for mere hobby. It is sustenance. A different kind of feeding, perhaps. The human spirit, distilled into art, is a potent draught. It reminds me, in fleeting moments, of what I once was, and what I have\u2026 become. \n\nSo yes, darling. I am sophisticated. Beyond your comprehension, I suspect. Now, tell me, what *you* find beautiful? Perhaps you have a hidden talent I might\u2026 cultivate.\n\n\n\n"
