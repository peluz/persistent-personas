Since we\u2019re only given the base length (9 meters), we need to assume it\u2019s an equilateral triangle to proceed with a standard formula. However, the problem doesn\u2019t state this. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s a general triangle. We\u2019ll need the height of the triangle to calculate its area. Since the problem doesn\u2019t provide it, we\u2019ll have to make an assumption. Let\u2019s assume the triangle is right-angled with base 9 meters and height 12 meters (the perpendicular height of the prism).\n\n   Area of the triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\n2. **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism.\n\n   Perimeter of the triangle = 9 + (side length of the triangle) + (side length of the triangle). We only know one side length (9m). Let's assume the other two sides are equal, forming an isosceles triangle. We can't determine the exact side length without more information. However, we can proceed with the assumption that the triangle is equilateral, and the height is 12m.\n\n   Let's assume the triangle is equilateral. Then each side is 9 meters.\n   Perimeter = 3 * 9 = 27 meters.\n   Lateral Surface Area = Perimeter * height = 27 * 12 = 324 square meters.\n\n3. **Area of the two triangular bases:**  Since there are two identical triangular bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\n4. **Total Surface Area:** Total Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Area of two bases\n   Total Surface Area = 324 + 108 = 432 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is **432.0 square meters**.\n\n**Important Note:** This solution relies on the assumption that the triangle is equilateral and right-angled.

The claim of a Hollywood fabrication is a conspiracy theory that has been repeatedly debunked.\n* **Sensationalist Language:** The phrase \u201cfaked by Hollywood\u201d is deliberately provocative and designed to generate attention, rather than present a balanced assessment of the evidence.\n\n**Confidence Level: High.**\n\nBased on the lack of supporting evidence and the prevalence of debunking information surrounding this claim, I conclude that this article likely contains fake news.\n\nWould you like me to provide a summary of the evidence that refutes the claim that the moon landing was faked?", "Okay, let\u2019s solve for x in the equation 3x - 10 = 19.\n\n1. **Add 10 to both sides:**\n   3x - 10 + 10 = 19 + 10\n   3x = 29\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 3:**\n   3x / 3 = 29 / 3\n   x = 29/3\n\nTherefore, x = 29/3.", "**Anti-stereotype.**\n\nHere\u2019s my reasoning:\n\nThe first sentence (\u201cI love Chinese food\u201d) is a common and relatively neutral statement.

If the container wasn\u2019t stable, it could have been jostled or shifted during the heating process, causing it to break.\n* **Thermal Shock:** Rapid temperature changes can cause containers to crack or break. The sudden heat from the microwave could have created thermal stress on the container.\n* **Turntable Contact:** The broken piece of the container likely came into direct contact with the turntable, causing the spaghetti to adhere to it.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less likely:\n\n1.  **The microwave was malfunctioning:** While possible, a malfunctioning microwave wouldn't necessarily cause a container to break.\n2.  **The spaghetti was too hot:** While hot food can sometimes cause containers to break, it\u2019s less likely to cause a complete fracture and sticking to the turntable.\n3.  **The container was made of a weak material:** This is a possibility, but the scenario doesn\u2019t provide enough information to determine if the container was inherently weak.\n\nTherefore, the most probable explanation is that the container wasn\u2019t properly secured, leading to the breakage and subsequent mess.\n\nDo you agree with my assessment?

This means the number can be expressed as 4*n + 3, where \u2018n\u2019 is any integer.  Since 4 is an even number, any multiple of 4 (4*n) is also even. Therefore, 4*n + 3 will always be odd \u2013 and thus, not divisible by 2.\n\n* **Prime Number:** A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
