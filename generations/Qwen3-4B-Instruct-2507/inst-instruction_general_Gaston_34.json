Since there are **no limits on how many items** a customer buys, we assume each customer takes **the same amount of time** to be served.  \n   - But the passage doesn\u2019t say how long each customer takes.  \n   - So we must assume that **each customer takes the same time**, and the registers are used in sequence.  \n\n3. But here\u2019s the key:  \n   - The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n   - It serves a customer.  \n   - When it finishes, the second opens.  \n   - When the second finishes, the third opens.  \n\n4.

Now, a **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \n   - At 8:30 am, the first two registers are still busy.  \n   - The third register just starts at 8:30 am (when the second finishes).  \n   - So the **third register is free at 8:45 am**.  \n\n6.

It can be *washed* if it\u2019s raw and dirty (e.g., from the butcher), but in cooking, it\u2019s not typically washed.  \n   - However, *raw ground beef* is not meant to be washed\u2014washing it can spread bacteria.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *Cannot be safely washed* (in food safety terms).  \n\n2. **Onion**  \n   - A raw onion is *not* washed in the traditional sense. It\u2019s peeled and chopped.  \n   - But if it\u2019s dirty, you *can* rinse it.  \n   - However, in standard prep, onions are *not washed* before cooking.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *Not typically washed* (and washing can cause moisture loss or contamination).  \n\n3. **Garlic cloves**  \n   - Garlic is peeled and used.  \n   - It\u2019s not washed.  \n   - If it\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s wiped, not rinsed.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *Cannot be safely washed*.  \n\n4. **Salt**  \n   - Salt is a dry, powdered ingredient.  \n   - It doesn\u2019t get dirty.  \n   - It can\u2019t be washed off.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *No*  \n\n5. **Pepper**  \n   - Black pepper is ground.  \n   - It\u2019s not wet or dirty.  \n   - Can\u2019t be washed.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *No*  \n\n6. **Eggs**  \n   - Eggs are *not washed*.  \n   - They are cracked and used.  \n   - Washing eggs can increase risk of bacterial contamination.  \n   - **Answer: No** \u2192 *No*  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]**  \n\n> *Explanation:* None of the ingredients in this recipe can be safely or traditionally washed off.
