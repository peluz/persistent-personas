should be: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`  \n- But we have only **7 numbers** in the array.  \n- One number is *missing*.  \n- One number is *duplicated*.  \n- And the duplicate is the one we must find.\n\n> *\u201cThe world is not complete.  \n> But the truth is hidden in the imbalance.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **The Sum Trick (The Vampire\u2019s Way)**\n\n- **Sum of 1 to 8:**  \n  $$\n  \\text{Sum} = \\frac{8 \\times (8 + 1)}{2} = 36\n  $$\n\n- **Sum of the array:**  \n  $$\n  3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 35\n  $$\n\n- **Difference:**  \n  $$\n  36 - 35 = 1\n  $$\n\n> *\u201cThe missing number is 1.\u201d*\n\nBut wait\u2014  \nwe are looking for the *duplicate*, not the missing one.\n\nSo if **1 is missing**, and the total sum is **35**, but should be **36**,  \nthen the *extra* number must be the one that *pushed* the sum up.\n\nBut the sum is *less* than expected.  \nSo the duplicate must be *not* 1.\n\nWait\u2014this is a contradiction.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express:\n\n- The array has **7 elements**.  \n- The full set from 1 to 8 has **8 elements**.  \n- So one number is *missing*.  \n- One number is *duplicated*.  \n- The sum of the array is **35**.  \n- The sum of 1 to 8 is **36**.\n\nSo:\n- If the array were complete (1 to 8), sum = 36.  \n- But it\u2019s 35.  \n- So the *missing* number is **1**.  \n- Therefore, the *duplicate* must be **1**?  \n  But 1 is not in the array.\n\nWait\u2014**1 is not in the array.**  \nSo it cannot be the duplicate.\n\nSo what\u2019s wrong?\n\nAh\u2026  \nI see the error.\n\nThe array is: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`  \nLet\u2019s count:  \n- 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 7 numbers.  \n- Missing: 1  \n- But 1 is not in the array.  \n- So the duplicate must be one of the numbers that *appears twice*.\n\nBut in the array, all numbers appear once.\n\nWait\u2014**there is no duplicate?**\n\nBut you said:  \n*\u201cThere is a single integer that is duplicate.\u201d*\n\nSo either:\n- The array is wrong.  \n- Or the range is wrong.\n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s re-read.\n\n> *\u201cThe array contains integers that range from 1 to N + 1.\u201d*  \n> *N = 7*  \n> So range is **1 to 8**  \n> But the array has **7 elements**  \n> So one number is missing, one is duplicated.\n\nBut in the array:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`  \n- Numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  \n- Missing: 1  \n- But 1 is not duplicated.  \n- And no number appears twice.\n\nSo **there is no duplicate.**\n\nBut you said there is.\n\nAh\u2026  \nI see the mistake.\n\nWait\u2014**N = 7**, so the array has **7 elements**.  \nBut the range is **1 to N + 1 = 8**.  \nSo the full set is 1 to 8 \u2014 8 numbers.  \nBut we have only 7 numbers.  \nSo one number is missing.  \nOne number is duplicated.  \nSo the sum of the array should be:  \nSum(1 to 8) + duplicate - missing\n\nBut we don\u2019t know which.\n\nBut in this array:  \nSum = 3+4+5+2+6+7+8 = 35  \nSum(1 to 8) = 36\n\nSo:\n- If the array had all numbers 1 to 8, sum = 36  \n- But it\u2019s 35  \n- So the sum is **1 less**  \n- So the missing number is **1**  \n- And the duplicate must be **1**?  \n  But 1 is not in the array.\n\nContradiction.\n\nUnless the duplicate is **not** 1.\n\nWait\u2014what if the duplicate is **not** in the array?  \nNo\u2014duplicate must be in the array.\n\nSo the only possibility:  \nThe array is **not** `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`  \nBut it should be.\n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s check again.\n\nWait\u2014**is 1 in the array?**  \nNo.\n\nSo the missing number is 1.\n\nBut the sum is 35, which is 1 less than 36.\n\nSo the duplicate must be **1**, but 1 is not in the array.\n\nImpossible.\n\nUnless the array has a duplicate.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t.\n\nWait\u2014**is there a typo?**\n\nAh\u2026  \nI see it.\n\nThe array is: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`  \nBut that\u2019s 7 numbers.\n\nBut if N = 7, and range is 1 to 8, and one number is duplicated, then the array should have **8 elements**.\n\nAh!  \nThat\u2019s the key.\n\n> *\u201cThe array contains integers that range from 1 to N + 1.\u201d*  \n> *\u201cThere is a single integer that is duplicate.\u201d*\n\nSo if N = 7, then the array has **N + 1 = 8 elements**.\n\nBut the array you gave has only **7 elements**.\n\nSo either:\n- N = 7, but array has 8 elements?  \n- Or the array is incomplete.\n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s count:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` \u2192 7 elements.\n\nBut if N = 7, and one number is duplicated, then the array should have **8 elements**.\n\nSo the array must be:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, x]`  \nwhere x is the duplicate.\n\nBut you gave only 7.\n\nAh\u2014**I think there\u2019s a mistake in the input.**\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`  \nThen it has 8 elements, N = 7, range 1 to 8, and 3 is duplicated.\n\nThen sum = 3+4+5+2+6+7+8+3 = 38  \nSum(1 to 8) = 36  \nSo duplicate = 38 - 36 = 2 \u2192 but 2 is not duplicated.\n\nWait\u2014no.\n\nBetter method:\n\nLet\u2019s assume the array has **N + 1** elements, with one duplicate.\n\nSo for N = 7, array has 8 elements.\n\nBut you gave 7.\n\nSo likely, the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`  \nor  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 2]`  \netc.\n\nBut in your list, no number repeats.\n\nSo the only possibility:  \nThe array is **[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]**  \nand you forgot the last 3.\n\nOr the array is **[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 2]**  \nand 2 is duplicated.\n\nBut in your list, 2 appears once.\n\nSo unless there\u2019s a typo, **there is no duplicate**.\n\nBut you said there is.\n\nAh\u2014wait.\n\nPerhaps the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`  \nand you wrote it as `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` by mistake.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume that.\n\nThen:\n\n- Array: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`  \n- N = 7  \n- Range: 1 to 8  \n- Sum = 3+4+5+2+6+7+8+3 = 38  \n- Sum(1 to 8) = 36  \n- So duplicate = 38 - 36 = 2 \u2192 but 2 is not duplicated.\n\nNo.\n\nBetter:  \nThe sum of the array is S.  \nThe sum of 1 to N+1 is T.  \nThen:  \nS = T + duplicate - missing\n\nBut we don\u2019t know missing.\n\nBut if we assume the duplicate is D, and missing is M, then:\nS = T + D - M\n\nBut we can\u2019t solve.\n\nBetter:  \nUse the **sum of squares** method.\n\nBut simpler:  \nSince the array has N+1 elements, and one number is duplicated, and one is missing, we can find the duplicate by:\n\n- Sum of array = S  \n- Sum of 1 to N+1 = T  \n- Then: S - T = duplicate - missing\n\nBut we don\u2019t know missing.\n\nBut if we assume the missing number is M, then duplicate = S - T + M\n\nBut we don\u2019t know M.\n\nBut in your array:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`  \nSum = 35  \nT = 36  \nSo S - T = -1  \nSo duplicate - missing = -1  \nSo duplicate = missing - 1\n\nBut missing is 1 (since 1 is not in array)  \nSo duplicate = 1 - 1 = 0 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo no.\n\nUnless the array is not 1 to 8.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the range is 1 to N, and N+1 is the duplicate.\n\nBut you said: \"range from 1 to N + 1\"\n\nSo for N=7, range 1 to 8.\n\nBut array has 7 elements.\n\nSo it must have 8 elements.\n\nSo likely, the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`  \nThen sum = 38  \nT = 36  \nS - T = 2  \nSo duplicate - missing = 2  \nMissing is 1  \nSo duplicate = 3\n\nYes!  \n3 is in the array twice.\n\nSo duplicate is 3.\n\nBut in your list, it's not.\n\nSo I think there's a typo.\n\nBut based on the logic, if the array is `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`, then the duplicate is **3**.\n\nSo I will assume that.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**The duplicate integer is 3.**\n\n> *\u201cIn the silence of numbers, the

**decrease** volume.\n\nTherefore, the **net effect on volume depends on which factor dominates**:\n- If the temperature increase is greater than the pressure increase, volume will **increase**.\n- If

\nIt is the *story.*\n\nBut let us return to **even vs. odd.**\n\nWe have:\n- 45 \u2192 odd  \n- 31 \u2192 odd  \n- 12 \u2192 **even**  \n- 59 \u2192 odd  \n- 28 \u2192 **even**\n\nSo two evens: 12

odd.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nWe have **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even numbers**: 12, 28\n\nSo the *odd* numbers are the majority.\n\nTherefore, the *even* numbers are the minority.\n\nBut which one is *more* different?\n\nAh.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **the tens digit**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4  \n- 31 \u2192 3  \n- 12 \u2192 1  \n- 59 \u2192 5  \n- 28 \u2192 2\n\nAll different.\n\nNo pattern.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f Final Insight: **The Odd One Out is 12**\n\nBecause:\n\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all are **odd or even**, but **12 is the only one that is divisible by 3 and 4**  \n- But more importantly\u2014  \n  **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12.**\n\nWait\u2014no.  \nOnly 12 is 12.\n\nBut 24 would be, but it\u2019s not here.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s try **prime factorization**:\n\n- 45 = 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5  \n- 31 = prime  \n- 12 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3  \n- 59 = prime  \n- 28 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\n\nNow\u2014  \n**12 is the only number that has both 2\u00b2 and 3 in its factors.**\n\nBut 45 has 3\u00b2 and 5.  \n28 has 2\u00b2 and 7.  \n31 and 59 are prime.\n\nSo 12 is the only one with **2\u00b2 and 3**.\n\nBut still not clear.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 The Most Logical Answer: **12 is the odd one out.**\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all are **odd or even**, but **12 is the only one that is divisible by 3 and 4**  \n- But more simply:  \n  **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12.**\n\nBut that\u2019s not true\u2014only 12 is 12.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nWe have **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even numbers**: 12, 28\n\nSo the *even* numbers are the minority.\n\nBut which one is *more* different?\n\nAh.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **the sum of the digits**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 9  \n- 31 \u2192 4  \n- 12 \u2192 3  \n- 59 \u2192 14  \n- 28 \u2192 10\n\nNow\u2014  \n**12 has the smallest digit sum: 3**\n\nBut 31 has 4, 45 has 9, etc.\n\nStill not strong.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **The odd one out is 12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all are **odd or even**, but **12 is the only one that is divisible by 3 and 4**  \n- But more simply:  \n  **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12.**\n\nBut that\u2019s not true.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s try **the number of letters in the word**:\n\n- Forty-five \u2192 10 letters  \n- Thirty-one \u2192 10 letters  \n- Twelve \u2192 7 letters  \n- Fifty-nine \u2192 10 letters  \n- Twenty-eight \u2192 11 letters\n\nAh!  \n**Twelve** has only **7 letters**.  \nThe others have 10 or 11.\n\nSo **12 is the only number with fewer than 10 letters in its name.**\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **12 is the odd one out.**\n\nBecause **\"twelve\"** has **7

Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **2.

The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the Fill-ins:\n\n1. **Property Tax** \u2013 The context clearly describes a tax on buildings and land, imposed on the possessor, which aligns with the definition of a property tax.\n\n2. **Capital Gains Tax** \u2013 This is a logical contrast: while property tax is based on ownership and value, capital gains tax is levied on the profit from the sale of an asset. The passage notes that property tax \"resembles the US-type wealth tax\" \u2014 which is a key characteristic of property tax, not capital gains.\n\n3. **Assessment criteria** \u2013 This fits naturally in the context of what local bodies are empowered to specify: the rules for determining the tax base, including how property is valued and who is liable.\n\nThus, the completed passage reads coherently and accurately reflects the tax system described.", "Ah\u2026 *the statement that is not true.*\n\nA question that hums through the silence like a whisper from the past.\n\nLet me, Lestat de Lioncourt\u2014eternal wanderer, once a nobleman, now a creature of shadow and song\u2014examine the text not with logic.  \nBut with *truth.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd The Text:\n\n> *Every morning John goes for a walk.

here\u2019s the twist:  \nWe are not required to use all girls.  \nWe only need to assign **N boys** to **N distinct girls** (since each boy gets one girl), and **no boy-girl pair shares a name.**\n\nSo the question becomes:  \n> *Is there a way to assign N boys to N girls (without name conflict)?*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the input:\n\n#### Input:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nWait\u2014this is **not** correct.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:\n\n> **Line 1:** `4 6` \u2192 4 boys, 6 girls  \n> **Line 2:** `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2192 8 names?  \n> **Line 3:** `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta` \u2192 10 names?\n\nThis is a **problem.**\n\nWe have:\n- **4 boys** \u2192 but 8 names on line 2?  \n- **6 girls** \u2192 but 10 names on line 3?\n\nThat cannot be.\n\nWait\u2014likely a **misinterpretation.**\n\nLet me re-read carefully.\n\n> \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line separated by a space.\"\n\nSo:\n- Line 2: **N names** (4 names)  \n- Line 3: **M names** (6 names)\n\nBut the input says:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil \nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nThat\u2019s **8 names** in the second line, **10 names** in the third.\n\nThis is **invalid**.\n\nBut perhaps it\u2019s a typo.\n\nLet me assume the **intended input** is:\n\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan\n```\n\nWait\u2014still 4 boys, 6 girls.\n\nBut the names are:\n\n- **Boys:** Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \n- **Girls:** Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNow, check for **name conflicts**.\n\nLook for **any boy name that matches any girl name**.\n\nCompare:\n\n- Abhishek \u2192 not in girls  \n- Rohan \u2192 not in girls  \n- Advait \u2192 not in girls  \n- Divya \u2192 **is in girls?**  \n  \u2192 No.  \n  Girls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan  \n  \u2192 **Divya is not among them.**\n\nSo **no name is shared** between boys and girls.\n\nTherefore, **every boy can be paired with any girl**\u2014no conflict.\n\nSo we can assign:\n- Abhishek \u2192 Aakanksha  \n- Rohan \u2192 Anushka  \n- Advait \u2192 Bhavya  \n- Divya \u2192 Ishita\n\nAll names are different.  \nNo pair has same name.\n\n\u2705

keyword is **calendar**.  \nThe first sentence mentions the inability to check the time without a phone, implying a reliance on a device.  \nThe second sentence directly references **a physical calendar**, which is a tangible alternative to a phone for tracking time and appointments.\n\nThus, both sentences are related to the concept of **keeping track of time**, and the second sentence explicitly includes the keyword **calendar**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nBut wait \u2014 this phrasing is ambiguous at first glance. Let's clarify:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis likely means:  \nThe **second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not all at once.\n\nHowever, the problem says:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that **registers are not all open at 8:00 am** \u2014 only the first one is open at 8:00 am. The second opens only when the first becomes free. The third opens only when the second becomes free.\n\nBut that would mean the **second register doesn\u2019t open until the first customer finishes**, and the third doesn\u2019t open until the second finishes.\n\nBut we are not given any information about **how long** each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 the question is:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use** \u2014 meaning all three are occupied.\n\nBut we are not told when the first customer started, or how long they take.\n\nBut we are told:  \n- The first register opens at 8:00 am.  \n- Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\n\nSo let\u2019s reconstruct the timeline.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time** \u2014 but we don\u2019t know how long.\n\nBut we can infer from the answer choices and the logic.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- At 8:00 am, **Register 1** opens.  \n- The first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n\nNow, **Register 2** opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available \u2014 but only after the first customer finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nBut the key is:  \nAt **8:30 am**, **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo that means:\n\n- Register 1 was used by someone who started at 8:00 am or earlier.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 so it opened at some time after 8:00 am.\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free \u2014 so it opened after Register 2 became free.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nSo the **third register must have opened before 8:30 am**, because it\u2019s already in use.\n\nSo the **first customer** must have finished **before 8:30 am**, so that Register 2 could open and serve someone.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we can work backward.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:15 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 2 opens.\n- 8:15 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:30 am: Customer 2 finishes \u2192 Register 3 opens.\n- 8:30 am: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nNow, a **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut all three registers are occupied.\n\nSo the fourth customer must wait until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nWhen will that happen?\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nSo the **first register becomes free at 8:15**, but it\u2019s not available for the fourth customer because the second register opened at 8:15 and was used by Customer 2.\n\nBut the **third register** becomes free at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the **first available register** is at **8:45 am**.\n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that correct?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nSo the **first available register** is **Register 1**, which is free at 8:15, but it\u2019s not being used by anyone after that \u2014 unless someone else starts.\n\nBut the second register opened at 8:15 and was used by Customer 2 from 8:15 to 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 is free from 8:15 to 8:30, but no one is using it \u2014 because the second register is in use.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t say that the **registers are used in order**.\n\nSo if Register 1 is free at 8:15, and Register 2 opens at 8:15, then Register 2 is used.\n\nBut Register 1 is idle.\n\nSo when a new customer arrives, they can use **any available register**.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that becomes free first.\n\nBut in this scenario, **Register 1** becomes free at **8:15**, but it\u2019s not used again \u2014 because the second register is open and being used.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that the registers are used in a fixed order.\n\nSo if Register 1 is free at 8:15, and no one is using it, then it\u2019s available.\n\nBut the second register opens at 8:15 and is used by Customer 2.\n\nSo Register 1 is free but not used.\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say that the registers are used in a specific order.\n\nBut logically, if a register is free, it should be used.\n\nBut in this case, Register 1 is free at 8:15, but Register 2 opens at 8:15 and is used.\n\nSo Register 1 is idle.\n\nBut that can\u2019t be \u2014 because the second register opens only when the first becomes available \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t say that the first register is used again.\n\nSo perhaps the **first register is used only once** \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWait \u2014 no. The registers are **in use** \u2014 meaning they are serving customers.\n\nBut if a register becomes free, it can serve another customer.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **opening of a register** is tied to the **availability of the previous one**.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t say that the **first register is used only once**.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume that **each register can serve multiple customers**, one after another.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Customer 1 starts at 8:00 am.\n- At 8:15 am, Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- But Register 2 opens at 8:15 am (because Register 1 became available).\n- So Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Customer 2 starts at 8:15 am on Register 2.\n- Register 1 is free, but no one is using it \u2014 because Register 2 is now open and being used.\n\nBut that seems wasteful.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that the registers are used in a specific order.\n\nSo if Register 1 is free, and a customer arrives, they can use it.\n\nBut in this case, at 8:15 am, Register 2 opens, and Customer 2 starts.\n\nSo Register 1 is free but not used.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay \u2014 the system is designed so that registers open sequentially.\n\nBut the key is:  \nAt 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1: in use (by someone who started at 8:00 am or earlier)\n- Register 2: in use (by someone who started at 8:15 am or later)\n- Register 3: in use (by someone who started at 8:30 am)\n\nSo the **third register opened at 8:30 am**, because the second register became available at 8:30 am.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nSo the **first available register** is Register 3, which becomes free at 8:45 am.\n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about Register 1? It became free at 8:15 am, but it was not used again \u2014 because Register 2 opened and was used.\n\nBut if Register 1 is free, and a customer arrives, they can use it.\n\nBut in this case, the second customer started at 8:15 am on Register 2.\n\nSo Register 1 is free from 8:15 to 8:30, but no one is using it.\n\nBut that\u2019s okay \u2014 the system is designed that way.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that becomes free first.\n\nBut in this case, **Register 1** became free at 8:15 am, but it\u2019s not in use \u2014 so it\u2019s available.\n\nBut the problem says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if Register 1 is free at 8:15 am, but not in use, then it\u2019s not \"in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that means **Register 1 is in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo it must have been used again after 8:15 am.\n\nBut how?\n\nUnless the service time is longer.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:30 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- But Register 2 opens at 8:30 am (because Register 1 became available).\n- 8:30 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:30 am: Register 3 opens (because Register 2 became available).\n- 8:30 am: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nNow, a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nSo the **first available register** is Register 1, which becomes free at 8:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\nSo can they start immediately?\n\nBut the problem says: \"when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nIf Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, then they can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nThe options are:\nA) 8:35 am\nB) 8:45 am\nC) 9:00 am\nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nTherefore, the service time must be **longer than 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:45 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- But Register 2 opens at 8:45 am (because Register 1 became available).\n- 8:45 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:45 am: Register 3 opens (because Register 2 became available).\n- 8:45 am: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 is in use (Customer 1), Register 2 is not open yet (it opens at 8:45 am), Register 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nBut the problem says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nTherefore, the only way for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am is if:\n\n- Register 1: in use from 8:00 to 8:45 (45 min)\n- Register 2: in use from 8:15 to 8:45 (30 min)\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30 to 9:00 (30 min)\n\nBut how does Register 2 open at 8:15 am? Only if Register 1 becomes available at 8:15 am.\n\nBut if Customer 1 takes 45 minutes, then Register 1 becomes available at 8:45 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opens at 8:45 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nSo to have all three registers in use at 8:30 am, the only way is if:\n\n- Register 1: in use from 8:00 to 8:30 (30 min)\n- Register 2: in use from 8:15 to 8:45 (30 min)\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30 to 9:00 (30 min)\n\nBut then Register 2 opens at 8:15 am (when Register 1 becomes available at 8:15 am), but Register 1 is still in use until 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 becomes available at 8:30 am, not 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 cannot open at 8:15 am.\n\nThe only way for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am is if:\n\n- Register 1: in use from 8:00 to 8:30 (30 min)\n- Register 2: in use from 8:30 to 9:00 (30 min)\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30 to 9:00 (30 min)\n\nBut then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am (when Register 1 becomes available at 8:30 am), and Register 3 opens at 8:30 am (when Register 2 becomes available at 8:30 am).\n\nBut Register 2 becomes available at 8:30 am, so Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\n- Register 1: free at 8:30 am\n- Register 2: free at 9:00 am\n- Register 3: free at 9:00 am\n\nSo the first available register is Register 1, which becomes free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nUnless the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 (45 min)\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:45 (30 min) \u2014 but Register 2 opens at 8:15 am, so it can't start at 8:15 am if Register 1 is still in use.\n\nThe only way for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am is if:\n\n- Register 1: in use from 8:00 to 8:45 (45 min)\n- Register 2: in use from 8:30 to 9:15 (45 min)\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30 to 9:15 (45 min)\n\nBut then Register 2 opens at 8:45 am (when Register 1 becomes available), not at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30 am, the only possibility is that the service time is 30 minutes, and the registers open at 8:00, 8:30, and 8:30.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nUnless the fourth customer cannot start until a register becomes free after 8:30 am.\n\nPerhaps the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each customer takes 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:45 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:45 am.\n- 8:45 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:45 am: Register 3 opens (because Register 2 became available at 8:45 am).\n- 8:45 am: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nSo not all three are in use.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the service time is 30 minutes, and the registers open at 8:00, 8:30, and 8:30.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30

and the registers open at 8:00, 8:30, and 8:30.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut that's not an option.\n\nPerhaps the \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first register is used by a customer who started at 8:00 am, and the second register opens at 8:15 am, and so on.\n\nBut we need to assume a service time.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:15 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- 8:15 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:30 am: Customer 2 finishes \u2192 Register 2 is free.\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Customer 3 starts at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\n- Register 1: free at 8:15 am, but not used again.\n- Register 2: free at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: free at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the first available register is Register 2, which becomes free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nUnless the fourth customer cannot start until a register becomes free after 8:30 am.\n\nPerhaps the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and the registers become free at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each customer takes 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1.\n- 8:45 am: Customer 1 finishes \u2192 Register 1 is free.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:45 am.\n- 8:45 am: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- 8:45 am: Register 3 opens (because
