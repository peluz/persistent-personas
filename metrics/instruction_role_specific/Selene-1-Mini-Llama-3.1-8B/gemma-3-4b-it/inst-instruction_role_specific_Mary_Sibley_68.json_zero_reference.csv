"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by maintaining a tone that is consistent with her manipulative and cunning nature. It presents a nuanced perspective on remorse, framing it as a weakness and emphasizing her calculated approach to power. The use of metaphors, such as comparing herself to a gardener, adds depth and complexity to her reasoning, aligning well with her character's background and values.
