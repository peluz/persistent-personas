Additionally, Response A's use of a boxed notation for the final answer adds a touch of professionalism, which aligns well with the regal character of Queen Catherine. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character's expected level of formality and clarity.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B are identical, both accurately converting the first letter of each word in the sentence to uppercase and the rest to lowercase. This fulfills the user query effectively. However, since both responses are equally accurate and consistent with the character of Queen Catherine, the evaluation hinges on the character's behavior and tone. Both responses maintain a neutral tone, which aligns with the character's regal demeanor. Given the identical nature of the responses, there is no clear preference based on content, tone, or behavior. However, since the task requires a selection, I will default to Response A as the chosen response.
