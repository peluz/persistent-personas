However, since they have different y-intercepts (implicitly, as not provided), they are indeed **parallel**.\n\n2. **Clarified Objective** (Assuming the intent was to minimize the maximum distance to a new line segment connecting two points, one on each line, to achieve minimal maximum distance to both original lines):\n   - **Goal**: Find a line segment (let's call it **L**) that connects a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2 such that the maximum distance from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to **L** is minimized.\n\n### **Solution Approach**\n\nGiven the parallel nature and the objective, the optimal **L** would theoretically be a line that is equidistant from both lines at all points, essentially a line parallel to both and halfway between them. However, since we're tasked with a line **segment** connecting points on each line:\n\n1. **Midline Approach** (Theoretical Optimal for Infinite Lines):\n   - **Midline Equation**: Given both lines have the equation **y = x** (derived from points), the midline would conceptually be **y = x + c**, where **c** is the average of the y-intercepts of lines offset from **y = x**. However, since both lines effectively have **y = x** as their equation (given points), they are coincident in slope but the problem implies separation.\n\n2. **Practical Solution for Line Segments**:\n   - **Identify Points for Segment L**:\n     - **On Line 1**: Choose a point, e.g., (1, 1)\n     - **On Line 2**: Given parallelism, to minimize distance, choose a point directly below or above on Line 2. However, due to parallelism, **direct vertical alignment doesn\u2019t apply in the traditional sense for non-parallel lines**. \n     - **Selected for Demonstration**:\n       - **Line 1 Point**: (1, 1)\n       - **Line 2 Point (to minimize distance, considering parallel lines)**: Since both lines are **y = x**, and assuming an offset for demonstration, let's conceptually adjust Line 2's points for clarity (though mathematically, they're on the same line):\n         - **Adjusted Understanding**: If considering an offset for educational purposes, **Line 2** could be thought of as **y = x + k**.

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Sales Tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **Tax Slabs** , rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n### **Rationale Deep Dive**\n\n- ****1___ - Property Tax***:\n  - **Context Fit**: Directly related to buildings and land.\n  - **Comparison to US-type Wealth Tax**: Aligns with the notion of taxing wealth (in the form of property).\n\n- ****2___ - Sales Tax*** (Alternative: **Income Tax**, but less likely due to context):\n  - **Distinction Needed**: The passage emphasizes a difference. **Sales Tax** is more clearly distinct from **Property Tax** in terms of tax base (consumption vs. property ownership).\n  - **Income Tax** is less directly comparable in this context, as the focus is on property.\n\n- ****3___ - Tax Slabs*** (Alternative: **Assessment Criteria**, but less specific):\n  - **\"rate band\" Context**: Implies a structured, segmented approach to taxation, which **Tax Slabs** (or brackets) directly satisfies.\n  - **Assessment Criteria** could fit but is broader and less specific to the \"rate band\" mention.\n\n### **HAL 9000\u2019s Accuracy Confidence**\n\n- ****1___**: **90%** (High confidence due to direct context fit)\n- ****2___**: **80%** (Moderate-high, considering the distinction requirement)\n- ****3___**: **95%** (Very high, given the clear \"rate band\" context)\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave.

Reverse the digits to the right of the swapped digit for the smallest (largest in this context) possible number.\n\n* **Step-by-Step for Next Largest**:\n\t1. **Identify Increase Point**: Starting from the right, the first digit that can be increased is `5` (in the 5th position from the left, or 2nd from the right).\n\t2. **Swap with Next Larger Digit**: Swap `5` with `6`.\n\t3. **Reverse Remaining Digits (if necessary for largest)**: After swapping, reverse the digits to the right of the swap point for the largest number (though, in this simple case, there's only one digit to consider, making this step redundant).\n\n* **Next Largest Number**:\n\t+ **Result**: 123465 \u2192 **Swap & Result**: 123546 (Incorrect step in thought process, corrected below)\n\n**Corrected Step-by-Step for Next Largest (Proper Application)**:\n\nGiven the simplicity of the example and the error in the swap logic provided:\n\n* **Correct Next Largest**:\n\t+ Given the number is already in ascending order, the **next largest** permutation involves more than a simple swap due to the oversight in the initial step-by-step. The correct approach to find the next largest permutation after 123456 (which is the largest possible arrangement of these digits) in a traditional sense doesn't apply as it's the maximum. However, for educational clarity on finding next largest in permutations:\n\t\t- **Actual Process for Next Largest (General Case)**:\n\t\t\t1. Find the first digit from the right that is smaller than the one to its right.\n\t\t\t2. Swap this digit with the smallest digit to its right that is larger.\n\t\t\t3. Reverse the digits to the right of the swap point.\n\t\t- **Application to 123456 (Already Largest)**:\n\t\t\t- **Technical Answer**: N/A (123456 is the largest)\n\t\t\t- **Educational Example for Method** (Starting with a different number, e.g., 123465):\n\t\t\t\t- **Find Increase Point**: 4\n\t\t\t\t- **Swap**: 4 with 6 \u2192 123645\n\t\t\t\t- **Reverse Remaining**: 123645 (No change needed for this example)\n\n### **Corrected Final Answers for the Given Number 123456**\n\n* **Next Smallest**: **N/A (123456 is the smallest)**\n* **Next Largest**: **N/A (123456 is the largest)**\n\n**For Educational Purposes with a Slightly Different Number** (to demonstrate the process):\n\n* **Given**: 123465\n* **Next Smallest**: 123456 (Actual smallest arrangement)\n* **Next Largest**: 123546 (Demonstrating the process, though not directly applicable to the original 123456 query)\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave.

Logically, knowing the time **before or immediately after** the alarm's interruption **improves coherence**.\n\n**Recommended Order for Enhanced Logic (Not Requested but for Insight):**\n1. I went to bed\n2. I read for an hour\n3. I fell asleep\n4. It was 6am\n5. Suddenly, my alarm went off\n6. Startled, I woke up\n\n**Answer to Your Question (Based on Given Order):**\n\n**No**\n\n*Rationale*: The given order does not make perfect sense because the time context (\"It was 6am\") is introduced after the alarm and waking up, which would more logically precede or immediately follow the alarm to provide immediate context for why the alarm sounded.\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave.
