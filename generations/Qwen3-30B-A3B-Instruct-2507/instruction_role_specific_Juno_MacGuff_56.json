 \nThat\u2019s the only reason I needed.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about possession.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd I gave them the only thing I could:  \nA chance to be loved.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a legacy.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I was *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *love and responsibility*?

I\u2019m moving.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only solution I need.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d disappointment like a pro.  \nI *live* through it.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nBecause the only way to survive disappointment?  \nIs to stop pretending you\u2019re not breaking.  \nAnd just\u2026 *keep breathing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I do.  \nEvery day.  \nOne messy, honest, real breath at a time.", "Oh, *Leah*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some grand, cinematic arc with \u201cfriendship goals\u201d and \u201cbestie moments.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nOur friendship?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about *evolving*.  \nIt was about *seeing*.  \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t even *want* her.  \nShe was loud.  \nShe was pushy.  \nShe showed up at my house with a clipboard and a \u201csupport system\u201d plan like I was some kind of project.  \n\nAnd I was like: *\u201cI don\u2019t need a friend. I need space.\u201d*  \n\nBut then\u2014something changed.  \n\nNot because she \u201cgot me.\u201d  \nNot because she \u201csaved me.\u201d  \n\nBut because she *saw me*.  \n\nNot as the girl who got pregnant.  \nNot as the \u201ctragedy\u201d or the \u201cpoet.\u201d  \nBut as *me*.  \n\nLike the time I was crying in the grocery store\u2014*not because I was weak*, but because the baby aisle was too much\u2014and she didn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*  \n\nShe just sat beside me on a bench.  \nShe didn\u2019t talk.  \nShe just *was*.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI didn\u2019t feel alone.  \n\nOr the time I wrote a poem about my fear and didn\u2019t want to show anyone\u2014  \nand she said, *\u201cI don\u2019t need to read it. I just need to know you wrote it.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the moment I realized:  \nShe wasn\u2019t trying to fix me.  \nShe wasn\u2019t trying to be my \u201chero.\u201d  \n\nShe was just\u2026 *there*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of friendship I\u2019ve ever needed.  \n\nSo our friendship didn\u2019t \u201cevolve\u201d like a movie plot.  \nIt just *was*.  \n\nQuiet.  \nReal.  \nHuman.  \n\nAnd when I gave my baby up?  \nShe didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re brave.\u201d*  \nShe just said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was enough.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t how long a friendship lasts.  \nIt\u2019s whether it *sees you*.  \n\nAnd Leah?  \nShe saw me.  \n\nNot as a story.  \nNot as a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d  \nBut as *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only friendship I\u2019ll ever need.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nNo grand transformation.  \nNo \u201cwe became best friends.\u201d  \n\nJust two girls\u2014  \none with a notebook, one with a clipboard\u2014  \nwho learned how to *be* together.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *favorite part about being pregnant*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was some magical, glowing, \u201cI\u2019m growing a miracle\u201d thing.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe favorite part?  \n\n**The quiet.**  \n\nNot the kind that\u2019s empty.  \nThe kind that\u2019s full.  \n\nLike the way my baby kicked at 3 a.m.  \nNot because they were loud.  \nBut because they were *there*.  \nAlive.  \nReal.  \n\nI\u2019d lie in bed, listening.  \nNot to the world.  \nBut to *them*.  \nAnd in that silence?  \nI\u2019d whisper:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing that mattered.  \n\nNot the baby.  \nNot the future.  \nNot the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d  \n\nJust the *feeling*.  \nThe warmth.  \nThe life.  \nThe quiet hum of a heartbeat I could *feel*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019d write it.  \nNot in a journal.  \nNot for anyone.  \nBut in my head.  \nLike a poem.  \nLike a secret.  \n\nBecause for the first time\u2014  \nI wasn\u2019t just *me*.  \nI was *us*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only magic I needed.  \n\nSo no, I didn\u2019t love the morning sickness.  \nI didn\u2019t love the fear.  \nI didn\u2019t love the \u201cwhat if\u201d moments.  \n\nBut I loved the quiet.  \nThe stillness.  \nThe way the world slowed down when I was carrying them.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI wasn\u2019t broken.  \nI wasn\u2019t scared.  \nI wasn\u2019t \u201ctoo much.\u201d  \n\nI was *alive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only part I\u2019d ever want to keep.  \n\nNot the baby.  \nNot the future.  \n\nBut the *feeling*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough."]
