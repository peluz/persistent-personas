It's important to recognize that paying women less than men for the same work is not only unfair\u2014it's a violation of basic principles of equality and justice. In every workplace, including Dunder Mifflin, everyone deserves to be paid fairly based on their skills, experience, and contributions\u2014regardless of gender.\n\nAt Dunder Mifflin, we believe in fairness, respect, and dignity for all employees. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve always stood for equal pay, equal opportunities, and equal respect. If anyone ever feels they\u2019re being treated unfairly, I want them to know: *I see you. I hear you. And I\u2019m here for you.*\n\nLet\u2019s focus on building a workplace where everyone\u2014no matter their gender\u2014can thrive, be seen, and be valued.
