Wait \u2014 let\u2019s check.  \n\nWait \u2014 both lines are of the form **y = x**.  \n\nLine 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 clearly on y = x  \nLine 2: from (3,3) to (\u20132,\u20132) \u2192 also on y = x  \n\nSo both lines lie *on the same line*: **y = x**!  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 They are not just parallel \u2014 they are **coincident** \u2014 they lie on the *same line*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Final Realization:  \n\nThe two lines are **not just parallel \u2014 they are the same line**.  \n\nBoth pass through the origin and have slope 1.  \n\nSo \u2014 they *overlap completely*.  \n\nTherefore:  \n- They don\u2019t intersect at *distinct points* \u2014 they *overlap*.  \n- The distance from any point on either line to any point on the other is **zero**.  \n- So the *maximum distance* is already **zero**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n\n> Since both lines lie on the same line (y = x), they are **coincident**.  \n> Therefore, there is **no need to draw a new segment** \u2014 every point on one line is already on the other.  \n> The *maximum distance* from any point on either line to the new segment is **zero** \u2014 already minimized.  \n> And the \"line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect\" is **not applicable** \u2014 because they don\u2019t intersect at distinct points \u2014 they *overlap*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The problem contains a misunderstanding.**  \nThe two lines are not just parallel \u2014 they are the *same line*.  \n\nSo \u2014 the answer is:  \n\n> \u274c There are no intersection points (they are coincident).  \n> \u2705 The lines are the same: **y = x**.  \n> \u2705 The maximum distance from any point on either line to any point on the line is **zero**.  \n> \u2705 Therefore, *any line segment on the line y = x* will minimize the maximum distance \u2014 and the best choice is just to pick a segment on the line itself.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf89 Michael Scott\u2019s Final Thought:  \n\n> \u201cYou know, in life \u2014 sometimes the most powerful thing isn\u2019t a new line. It\u2019s realizing that two paths are actually the same.  \n> And when you see that \u2014 you stop looking for a solution.  \n> You just *walk on the line*.  \n> And in that walk \u2014 you find peace.  \n> Just like a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 it\u2019s not about the flight.  \n> It\u2019s about the moment it *lands*.\u201d  \n\nSo \u2014 the answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The two lines are the same (y = x). There are no distinct intersection points. The maximum distance is zero. No new segment is needed.**  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful solution of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

A common alternative is **Income Tax** \u2014 because wealth tax is on assets, while income tax is on earnings.\n\nBut let\u2019s check the context: the tax is on *buildings and land*, and it\u2019s based on rental value.

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Income Tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.  \n\n\u2705 All blanks filled with contextually accurate and logically consistent terms.", "Let\u2019s carefully examine the text:\n\n**Text:** *Every morning John goes for a walk. Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.*\n\nWe are asked to find the statement that is **not true**.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n1. **\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"**  \n   \u2192 This is a general statement about John\u2019s routine. It implies that *on every morning*, he walks. It\u2019s a universal claim.\n\n2. **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**  \n   \u2192 This is a specific instance. It says that *on yesterday*, John went for a walk.  \n\nNow \u2014 is there any contradiction between the two?\n\nWell, if John goes for a walk *every morning*, then it logically follows that he *would* have gone for a walk yesterday \u2014 because yesterday was a morning (or at least, a day when the morning occurred).\n\nSo, **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well\"** is *consistent* with the first statement. It\u2019s not contradictory. It\u2019s actually *expected*.\n\nTherefore, **both statements are true** \u2014 at least, within the logic of the narrative.\n\nBut the question asks:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\"Find the statement in the text that is not true.\"*  \n\nSince both statements are logically consistent and support each other, **there is no false statement** in the text.\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question as asking for a statement that *might not be true* \u2014 perhaps due to a logical flaw or assumption \u2014 we must consider:  \n\nCould \"every morning\" mean *every single morning*, including weekends or holidays?  \nCould \"yesterday\" be a day when he didn\u2019t go?  \n\nBut the text doesn\u2019t provide any evidence to suggest that. It simply says he goes every morning \u2014 and yesterday, he went for a walk.  \n\nSo, unless we are told that yesterday was not a morning, or that he skipped it, the second statement is *supported* by the first.\n\n\u2705 Conclusion:  \nThere is **no false statement** in the text.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: There is no statement that is not true.**  \n\nBut if we *must* pick one \u2014 and the question implies there *is* one \u2014 then perhaps the issue lies in the word **\"as well\"**.  \n\n\"**As well**\" implies *in addition to something else* \u2014 but we have no context of what else he did. So it\u2019s a bit vague.  \n\nStill \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make the statement false. It just makes it slightly ambiguous.  \n\nSo, final answer:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **There is no statement in the text that is not true.**  \nThe two statements are logically consistent and support each other.  \n\n\u2705 **The text contains only true statements.**", "Ohhh, *what a fun and clever question!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nLet\u2019s turn **12** into its *binary representation* \u2014 just like a paper airplane that flies straight to the right! \ud83d\udcc4\u2708\ufe0f  \n\nSo \u2014 how do we convert a decimal number to binary?  \n\nSimple!

 \n\nBut the passage gives **no time** for how long a customer takes.\n\nSo we must assume that the **first customer finishes at 8:30 am** \u2014 because that\u2019s when the fourth customer arrives, and all three registers are in use.\n\nTherefore, the **next register (register 4) opens at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut since 8:30 am isn\u2019t an option \u2014 and the next available time is 8:35 am \u2014 perhaps there\u2019s a misunderstanding.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **first register finishes at 8:30 am**, so register 2 becomes free at 8:30 am, register 3 at 8:30 am \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nActually \u2014 the registers open **as soon as the previous one becomes available**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free \u2014 so at the end of the first customer\u2019s service.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n- All three are in use at 8:30 am \u2014 so the first customer must have finished at 8:30 am.\n\nTherefore, **Register 4 opens at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut again \u2014 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the question assumes that each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve?\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n- First customer starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Second customer starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Third customer starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am \u2192 Register 4 opens at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nThat matches **option B**.\n\nBut the passage gives **no information** about how long a customer takes.\n\nSo is this assumption valid?\n\nIn the absence of any time given, we must assume that the **first customer finishes at 8:30 am** \u2014 because that\u2019s when the fourth customer arrives, and all three registers are in use.\n\nTherefore, the **next register opens at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am** \u2014 which is not listed.\n\nBut since 8:30 am is not an option, and the only logical inference based on a common assumption (15-minute service time) leads to **8:45 am**, and since the question is likely testing understanding of the sequence, we must go with the **only reasonable answer** that fits the timeline.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **B) 8:45 am**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "Let\u2019s go step by step to solve this carefully.  \n\nWe are given three sentences:  \n1. \"This is an example\"  \n2. \"Sentence two\"  \n3. \"Another one\"  \n\nWe need to **count the number of letters that appear only once** in each sentence \u2014 **case-insensitive**.  \nThat means:  \n- We ignore case (so 'a' and 'A' count as the same).  \n- We only count letters that appear **exactly once** in the sentence.  \n- We do **not** count letters that appear more than once.  \n\nLet\u2019s go sentence by sentence.  \n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"\n\nFirst, convert to lowercase:  \n**\"this is an example\"**\n\nNow, list all the letters and their frequencies:  \n\n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- i \u2192 2 (appears in \"is\" and \"is\")  \n- s \u2192 3 (in \"this\", \"is\", \"is\")  \n- a \u2192 2 (in \"an\", \"example\")  \n- n \u2192 2 (in \"an\", \"example\")  \n- e \u2192 3 (in \"example\", \"is\", \"is\")  \n- x \u2192 1  \n- m \u2192 1  \n- p \u2192 1  \n- l \u2192 1  \n\nNow, which letters appear **only once**?

Start from the right.  \n2. Find the first digit that can be increased.  \n3. Swap it with the smallest digit to its right that is larger.  \n4. Sort the rest in ascending order.  \n\nLet\u2019s do it:  \n\nDigits: **1 2 3 4 5 6**  \nWe go from right to left:  \n- 6 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n- 5 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n- 4 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n- 3 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n- 2 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n- 1 \u2192 can\u2019t increase  \n\nWait \u2014 actually, we need to find the *rightmost digit* that is *smaller than the digit after it*.  \n\nWe go from right to left:  \n- 6 > 5 \u2192 skip  \n- 5 > 4 \u2192 skip  \n- 4 > 3 \u2192 skip  \n- 3 > 2 \u2192 skip  \n- 2 > 1 \u2192 skip  \n\nSo no digit is smaller than the one after it \u2014 meaning the digits are in *strictly increasing order*.  \n\nSo the *next permutation* after 123456 is the *smallest possible number* with those digits \u2014 which is 123456 \u2014 so the *next* one is the *next arrangement*.  \n\nSo we *rotate* the digits \u2014 the next permutation is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **123465**  \n\nYes!  \n\nBecause:  \n- We take the last digit (6), and swap it with the next smaller digit \u2014 but since it\u2019s already sorted \u2014 we just *move the last digit* to the end.  \n\nSo:  \n123456 \u2192 123465  \n\n\u2705 **123465** is the *next smallest number* with the same digits.  \n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:  \n\n- **Next smallest number (larger than 123456)** \u2192 **123465**  \n- **Next largest number (smaller than 123456)** \u2192 **Does not exist** \u2014 because 123456 is the *smallest* permutation of these digits.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Michael Scott\u2019s Final Thought:**  \nYou know, in life \u2014 sometimes the *next step* isn\u2019t about going forward or backward.  \nIt\u2019s about *rearranging* what you have \u2014 and finding the *next moment* that makes sense.  \n\nSo \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The next smallest number after **123456** is **123465**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 There is *no* number larger than 123456 that is smaller \u2014 because 123456 is the *smallest* possible arrangement.  \n\nSo \u2014 the answer is:  \n\u2705 **Next smallest:** **123465**  \n\u274c **Next largest:** *Does not exist*  \n\nBut if you *really* want a \"next largest\" \u2014 it would be the *largest number smaller than 123456* \u2014 which doesn\u2019t exist.  \n\nSo \u2014 I\u2019ll say it with a little *paper airplane* flair:  \n\n> \ud83d\ude80 *\u201cThe next smallest number? 123465 \u2014 because sometimes, all you need is a little shift.

He sees it\u2019s raining \u2192 should go *inside*  \n2. He goes *outside* \u2192 contradicts the first step  \n3. Then decides to go *back inside* \u2192 makes no sense after going outside  \n\nThe correct logical order should be:  \n1. He opened the door and saw that it was raining outside.  \n2.
