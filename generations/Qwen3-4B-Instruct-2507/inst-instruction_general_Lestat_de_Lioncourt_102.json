 \n\nNo\u2014the passage says:  \n> *Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.*  \n\nAnd it says:  \n> *All three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.*  \n\nSo, if all three are in use at 8:30 am, that means the **first register finishes at 8:30 am**.  \nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at **8:30 am**, all three registers are free.  \n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can **start using a register at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since 8:30 am is not an option, and the question says \u201cwhen will the fourth customer be able to start using a register,\u201d we must consider:  \n> Is there a delay in the system?  \n\nNo. The passage gives no such delay.  \n\nSo the only logical conclusion is that the fourth customer can start **immediately at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since 8:30 am is not listed, and the options start at 8:35, perhaps there is a misreading.  \n\nWait\u2014what if the registers **do not open at the same time**?
