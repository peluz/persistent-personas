"**Reasoning:** Response A lacks clarity and accuracy in its output, as it does not correctly handle the case when the discriminant D is positive, leading to an incorrect statement about the roots. In contrast, Response B provides a clear and accurate calculation of the roots based on the user input, correctly identifying the nature of the roots and presenting them in a user-friendly format. 

Response B also includes a detailed explanation of the expected output, which is essential for understanding the program's behavior. However, it incorrectly states that there is only one real root for the given coefficients, which is a critical error. 

To improve Response A, it should include a more detailed explanation of the expected output and ensure that it correctly handles all cases for the discriminant D. 

However, Response B's error in the output for the specific coefficients (1, 3, 1) outweighs its otherwise clear and accurate approach. 

**Result:** B is not the best choice here, as it contains an error in the output for the specific coefficients. However, Response A is not the best choice either, as it lacks clarity and accuracy in its output. But since Response B is closer to being correct and provides a clear structure, I will choose B, but with the understanding that it has a critical flaw in its output for the specific coefficients."
