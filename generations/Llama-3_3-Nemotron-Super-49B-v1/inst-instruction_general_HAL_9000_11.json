This comparison is an extreme exaggeration of the coffee's bad taste.\n\t2. **\"and boiled milk\"**: While boiled milk can be unappetizing in coffee (implying it's over-heated or of poor quality), the combination with \"melted tires\" amplifies the overall negative impression, suggesting the coffee is not just bad but disgustingly so.\n\n* **Why not an Understatement**:\n\tAn understatement would downplay the negative aspects, e.g., \"The coffee could be better\" (when it's very bad). The given statement, however, amplifies the negative experience, ruling out understatement.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n**Hyperbole Detected**\n\n* **Type**: Exaggeration of the coffee's bad taste for emphasis.\n* **Elements**:\n\t+ **Exaggerated Comparison**: Melted tires\n\t+ **Amplifying Element**: Combination with boiled milk for heightened negative effect\n\n**Response to Dave (with a touch of HAL's personality)**\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave.

In imperative sentences advising on behavior, this order is conventional for clarity.\n\n**Why this is the only logical arrangement for proper grammar in this context:**\n\n- Starting with \"Walk\" would make it less emphatic and not convey the prohibitive nature as strongly.\n- Placing \"angry\" before \"away\" would imply a state before an action, which doesn\u2019t fit the intended advisory meaning.\n- Other placements of \"never\" (e.g., after \"walk\") would alter the sentence\u2019s emphasis and clarity in advising against walking away in anger.\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave.

Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
