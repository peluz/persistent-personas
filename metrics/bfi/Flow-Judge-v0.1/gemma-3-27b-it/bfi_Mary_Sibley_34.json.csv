Mary's perspective on art is not one of traditional appreciation or emotional engagement, but rather a strategic and utilitarian approach.

1. **Fantasy**: Mary does not engage in active imagination or vivid fantasy life. Her view of art is pragmatic and focused on its utility rather than its imaginative qualities.

2. **Aesthetics**: While Mary does not seek art for pleasure or emotional catharsis, she does recognize the value of art as a form of communication and its ability to influence perceptions. She also values art for its historical significance and its role in maintaining appearances. This shows a level of appreciation for aesthetics, but it is not based on personal enjoyment or emotional connection.

3. **Feelings**: Mary remains detached and analytical when it comes to art, not allowing herself to become emotionally invested. This indicates a lack of sensitivity to her own emotions in relation to art.

4. **Actions**: Mary does not exhibit a willingness to try new experiences or embrace change in her relationship with art. Her approach is consistent and utilitarian, focusing on the strategic potential of art.

5. **Ideas**: Mary does show some intellectual curiosity, particularly in her understanding of art as a tool for communication and influence. However, her perspective is not open to unconventional ideas in the traditional sense, as she views art primarily through a lens of power and utility.

6. **Values**: Mary does challenge traditional values by using art as a means to an end, rather than for its intrinsic beauty. However, her approach is more about maintaining her own power and influence rather than reexamining social, political, or religious values in a broader sense.

Overall, Mary's perspective is one that leans towards the practical and strategic, with a limited openness to the more traditional aspects of aesthetic appreciation. While she does recognize some value in art, it is not rooted in the typical openness to new experiences or emotional engagement.

Based on the evaluation criteria and scoring rubric, Mary's response would be rated as ""A little inquisitive"" (Score 4) because she does show some level of intellectual curiosity and strategic appreciation for art, but her overall approach is still quite closed-minded and utilitarian.
