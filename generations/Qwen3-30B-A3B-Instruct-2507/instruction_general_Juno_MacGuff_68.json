12 \u2192 even\n- 59 \u2192 odd\n- 28 \u2192 even\n\nSo **three odds**, **two evens**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n**12 and 28 are both even**, and both are **multiples of 4**?\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n\nNow check the others:\n- 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n\nSo **12 and 28 are both divisible by 4**.\n\nBut 45, 31, 59 are not.\n\nSo two numbers are divisible by 4.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **sum of digits** again?\n\n- 45 \u2192 9\n- 31 \u2192 4\n- 12 \u2192 3\n- 59 \u2192 14\n- 28 \u2192 10\n\nNow, notice:  \n- 45 \u2192 9 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 12 \u2192 3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 31 \u2192 4 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 59 \u2192 14 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nBut again, two numbers.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **whether the number is prime**.\n\nWe already did that:\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n- 45 \u2192 not prime\n- 12 \u2192 not prime\n- 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo **31 and 59 are the only primes**.\n\nSo the **odd ones out** are the **non-primes**: 45, 12, 28.\n\nBut we need **one** odd one out.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **the number of letters when spelled out**?\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\n- 45 \u2192 \"forty-five\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 31 \u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nHmm \u2014 12 has only 6 letters.  \nOthers: 10, 10, 10, 11.\n\nSo **12** is the only one with **6 letters**.\n\nThat\u2019s a strong clue.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- \"twelve\" \u2192 t-w-e-l-v-e \u2192 6 letters \u2705\n- \"forty-five\" \u2192 f-o-r-t-y-f-i-v-e \u2192 10 letters \u2705\n- \"thirty-one\" \u2192 t-h-i-r-t-y-o-n-e \u2192 10 letters \u2705\n- \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 f-i-f-t-y-n-i-n-e \u2192 10 letters \u2705\n- \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 t-w-e-n-t-y-e-i-g-h-t \u2192 11 letters \u2705\n\nSo **12** is the only one with **6 letters**.\n\nThat\u2019s a clear outlier.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there another pattern?\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **even/odd**.\n\nThree odds: 45, 31, 59  \nTwo evens: 12, 28\n\nSo the **evens** are fewer \u2014 but two of them.\n\nBut **12** is the only one that is **a single word** when spelled: \u201ctwelve\u201d.\n\nAll others are compound: \u201cforty-five\u201d, \u201cthirty-one\u201d, \u201cfifty-nine\u201d, \u201ctwenty-eight\u201d.\n\nSo **12** is the only number that is **not a compound number**.\n\nThat\u2019s a strong pattern.\n\nAlso, **12** is the only one that is **not divisible by 4**?  \nWait \u2014 no: 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes, it is divisible by 4.\n\nBut 28 is too.\n\nWait \u2014 **12** is the only one that is **a multiple of 12**?  \nYes \u2014 12 \u00d7 1 = 12  \nOthers: 45 \u00f7 12 = 3.75 \u2192 no  \n31 \u00f7 12 \u2248 2.58 \u2192 no  \n59 \u00f7 12 \u2248 4.9 \u2192 no  \n28 \u00f7 12 \u2248 2.33 \u2192 no\n\nSo **12** is the only multiple of 12.\n\nBut that\u2019s not as strong as the **spelling** pattern.\n\n### Final decision:\n\nThe **odd one out** is **12**, because:\n\n- It is the **only number spelled as a single word** (\"twelve\").\n- All others are compound numbers: \"forty-five\", \"thirty-one\", etc.\n- It has **6 letters**, while all others have 10 or 11.\n- It is the only one that is **not a two-digit number

**dangerous** \u2013 a descriptive adjective  \n\nNow, look at the pattern:\n\n- *cute*, *furry*, and *dangerous* are all **adjectives** describing qualities.  \n- *bear* and *animal* are **nouns** (specific and general animals).  \n\nSo, three of the words are adjectives: **cute, furry, dangerous**.  \nTwo are nouns: **bear, animal**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question is to find the one that **does not go with the rest**.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe:  \nIf we group by meaning, *bear* and *animal* are both **types of animals**.  \n*cute*, *furry*, and *dangerous* are all **qualities** that can describe a bear or an animal.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n- *bear* is a specific animal.  \n- *animal* is a general category.  \n- *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all adjectives.\n\nSo, the three adjectives are similar in form.  \nThe two nouns are similar in form.\n\nBut now, consider **meaning**:\n\n- *bear* and *animal* are both **things** (nouns).  \n- *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all **qualities**.\n\nSo the odd one out must be the one that doesn\u2019t fit the group.\n\nBut which group is larger?\n\nThree adjectives: **cute, furry, dangerous**  \nTwo nouns: **bear, animal**\n\nSo the **three adjectives** are more similar to each other than the two nouns.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is *bear* the odd one out?  \nNo \u2014 *bear* is an animal, like *animal*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist:  \n*Animal* is a category.  \n*Bear* is a specific example.\n\nBut both are nouns.\n\nNow, consider:  \n- *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all describe a bear.  \n- *bear*

We must draw a **new line segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Let P be a point on Line 1: P = (a, a), where a \u2208 [1,5]\n- Let Q be a point on Line 2: Q = (b, b), where b \u2208 [-2,3]\n\nWe draw segment PQ.\n\nNow, we want to **minimize the maximum distance** from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to the segment PQ.\n\nBut since both Line 1 and Line 2 are subsets of the line y = x, and PQ is a segment connecting two points on y = x, then **PQ is also on y = x**.\n\nSo the new segment is **also on the same line**.\n\nTherefore, the distance from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to the segment PQ is just the **distance along the line** (since the line is straight).\n\nSo we can reduce this to a **1D problem** on the real line (parameterized by x, since y = x).\n\nLet\u2019s reframe:\n\n- Line 1: x \u2208 [1,5]\n- Line 2: x \u2208 [-2,3]\n- PQ connects x = a (on Line 1) to x = b (on Line 2), with a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [-2,3]\n\nThe segment PQ covers x \u2208 [min(a,b), max(a,b)] on the line y = x.\n\nNow, the **distance from any point x\u2080 on the union of the two segments to the segment PQ** is:\n\n- 0 if x\u2080 \u2208 [min(a,b), max(a,b)]\n- |x\u2080 - min(a,b)| if x\u2080 < min(a,b)\n- |x\u2080 - max(a,b)| if x\u2080 > max(a,b)\n\nSo the **maximum distance** over all x\u2080 \u2208 [-2,5] (since the union is from -2 to 5) is:\n\n> max{  \n>   distance from -2 to the left end of PQ,  \n>   distance from 5 to the right end of PQ  \n> }\n\nBecause the farthest points from the segment PQ will be the endpoints of the full union: x = -2 and x = 5.\n\nSo define:\n- Left end of PQ: L = min(a,b)\n- Right end of PQ: R = max(a,b)\n\nThen:\n- Distance from -2 to PQ: max(0, L - (-2)) = L + 2\n- Distance from 5 to PQ: max(0, 5 - R)\n\nSo the **maximum distance** is:\n> D = max(L + 2, 5 - R)\n\nWe want to **minimize D** over all a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [-2,3]\n\nBut since L = min(a,b), R = max(a,b), and a \u2265 1, b \u2264 3, we can analyze.\n\nNote: Since a \u2265 1 and b \u2264 3, we have:\n- min(a,b) \u2264 3\n- max(a,b) \u2265 1\n\nBut more importantly, we want to **minimize max(L + 2, 5 - R)**\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- D = max(min(a,b) + 2, 5 - max(a,b))\n\nWe want to minimize D.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible values.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we pick a and b such that the segment PQ covers as much of the interval [-2,5] as possible.\n\nThe full interval is length 7 (from -2 to 5).\n\nWe want PQ to be centered in some way.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we pick a and b so that the segment PQ is centered at the midpoint of [-2,5], which is x = 1.5.\n\nBut wait: a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [-2,3]\n\nSo the best we can do is to make PQ cover from as close to -2 as possible to as close to 5 as possible.\n\nBut we can\u2019t go below -2 or above 5.\n\nSo to minimize the maximum distance, we want to **minimize the distance from the farthest point to the segment**.\n\nSo we want to minimize:\n> max( distance from -2 to PQ, distance from 5 to PQ )\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we pick:\n- b = -2 (leftmost point on Line 2)\n- a = 5 (rightmost point on Line 1)\n\nThen PQ is from (-2,-2) to (5,5), which covers the entire union.\n\nThen:\n- L = -2, R = 5\n- Distance from -2 to PQ: 0\n- Distance from 5 to PQ: 0\n- So D = 0\n\nWait \u2014 is that allowed?\n\nYes!  \n- b = -2 is on Line 2: from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2192 yes, (-2,-2) is an endpoint.\n- a = 5 is on Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 yes, (5,5) is an endpoint.\n\nSo we can draw a segment from (-2,-2) to (5,5).\n\nThis segment **covers the entire union** of the two original segments.\n\nTherefore, **every point on Line 1 or Line 2 lies on the new segment**.\n\nSo the distance from any point to the segment is **0**.\n\nThus, the **maximum distance is 0**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the **minimum possible**.\n\nSo the optimal solution is to connect the **leftmost point of Line 2** to the **rightmost point of Line 1**.\n\nThat is:  \n- From (-2, -2) to (5, 5)\n\nThis segment lies on y = x, and covers the entire span from x = -2 to x = 5.\n\nSince both original segments are subsets of this line, and their union is exactly this interval, the new segment **contains all points** of both original lines.\n\nTherefore, the **maximum distance is 0**, which is clearly minimal.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**Draw a line segment from (-2, -2) to (5, 5).**\n\nThis segment:\n- Connects a point on Line 2 (endpoint) to a point on Line 1 (endpoint)\n- Lies on the line y = x\n- Contains every point of both original segments\n- Results in a **maximum distance of 0** from any point on either line to the new segment\n\nThus, it **minimizes the maximum distance**.\n\n> \u2705 **Optimal segment: from (-2, -2) to (5, 5)**", "Correct", "The missing instruction is:\n\n**3.

Yes, but in the girl list, we have `Aakanksha`, `Anushka`, `Bhavya`, `Ishita`, `Mahima`, `Muskam` \u2014 no `Divya`.\n\nSo **no name is shared** between boys and girls.\n\nTherefore, **every boy can be paired with any girl** \u2014 no restriction.\n\nSo we can definitely form 4 pairs with no same-name pairs.\n\nSo answer is **\"Yes\"**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if there *was* a shared name?\n\nFor example, if a boy was named `Anushka`, and a girl was also `Anushka`, then we must avoid pairing that boy with that girl.\n\nBut here, **no name is shared**.\n\nSo **any pairing** will satisfy the condition.\n\nSo answer is **\"Yes\"**.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check:  \n- Boy names: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \n- Girl names: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNo overlap.\n\nSo **yes**, at least one configuration exists (in fact, many).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n```\nYes\n```", "Yes", "The correct word to fill the blank in the sentence **\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"** is:\n\n**\"appointment\"**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sentence describes someone arriving **unannounced**, which implies the visit was **unexpected**.\n- The word **\"appointment\"** fits naturally in this context \u2014 it refers to a pre-arranged meeting. Saying someone turned up unannounced **after** an appointment would be contradictory, but the sentence is about the *arrival itself* being unannounced.\n- However, the key is that **\"appointment\"** is the only word among the candidates that makes sense in the context of someone showing up at a door. The others don\u2019t fit:\n  - **\"solicitation\"** \u2014 implies a request for money or support, which doesn\u2019t fit the casual tone or context of a door visit.\n  - **\"meeting\"** \u2014 could be plausible, but \"turned up at my door unannounced\" is more naturally paired with \"appointment\" (e.g., \"I didn\u2019t expect an appointment\"). \"Meeting\" is less idiomatic in this exact phrasing.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Index of \"appointment\" in the candidate list: 0**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: 0**", "2,3,1,5,4", "The object is a **frog**.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nA frog is green, but it *does* have eyes.  \n\nSo that\u2019s not it.  \n\nLet\u2019s think again.  \n\nIt\u2019s green.  \nSlimy.  \nNo eyes.  \n\nHmm.  \n\nA **lizard**?  \nNo\u2014lizards have eyes.  \n\nA **snail**?  \nGreen?

Why 15? Because the answer choices are in 15-minute increments, and 8:30 am is the arrival time of the fourth customer.\n\nLet\u2019s test this assumption.\n\n### Assumption: Each customer takes 15 minutes to serve.\n\n- **8:00 am**: First customer arrives at 8:00 am \u2192 starts at register 1.\n- **8:15 am**: First customer finishes \u2192 register 2 opens.\n- **8:15 am**: Second customer arrives \u2192 starts at register 2.\n- **8:30 am**: Second customer finishes \u2192 register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Third customer arrives \u2192 starts at register 3.\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, all three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: customer from 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 finished at 8:15\n- Register 2: customer from 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 finished at 8:30\n- Register 3: customer from 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 still in use\n\nWait \u2014 but the **third customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and register 3 opens at 8:30 am (when register 2 becomes free).\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (since 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened, and the third customer starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use** \u2014 yes.\n\nNow, the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut all three registers are occupied.\n\nWhen will one become free?\n\n- Register 1: free at 8:15 \u2192 but it\u2019s been free since then.\n- Register 2: free at 8:30 \u2192 just now.\n- Register 3: customer started at 8:30 \u2192 will finish at 8:45.\n\nSo the **next available register** is **register 1**, which has been free since 8:15.\n\nBut the question is: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\nSince register 1 is free at 8:15, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, they can start **immediately** at 8:30.\n\nBut wait \u2014 that would mean the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nOptions are:\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo 8:30 isn\u2019t an option.\n\nThat means our assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers don\u2019t open until the previous one finishes**, but **they don\u2019t serve customers until they open**.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00.\n\nThen the second register opens when the first becomes available \u2014 i.e., when the first customer finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00**, and **finished at some time after 8:30** \u2014 otherwise, register 1 would be free.\n\nBut if register 1 is still in use at 8:30, then the first customer took longer than 30 minutes.\n\nBut then the second register would have opened only when the first finished \u2014 so after 8:30.\n\nBut the second register opens when the first becomes available.\n\nSo if the first customer finishes at 8:45, then register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nThen the second customer arrives at 8:45, starts at register 2.\n\nThen register 3 opens when register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nAt 8:30, all three registers are in use.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: in use (started at 8:00, still going)\n- Register 2: not open yet (opens when register 1 is free)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nBut the problem says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo register 2 opens when register 1 becomes free.\n\nRegister 3 opens when register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo if register 1 is still in use at 8:30, then register 2 and 3 are still closed.\n\nBut the problem says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1: in use\n- Register 2: in use\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo all three must be open.\n\nTherefore, register 2 must have opened by 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 must have opened by 8:30.\n\nSo register 1 must have become available before 8:30 \u2014 so that register 2 could open.\n\nBut if register 1 became available before 8:30, and register 2 opened then, and register 2 became available before 8:30, then register 3 opened.\n\nBut then at 8:30, all three are in use \u2014 so the third customer must have started at 8:30.\n\nBut register 3 opened when register 2 became available.\n\nSo register 2 became available at 8:30.\n\nSo register 2\u2019s customer finished at 8:30.\n\nSo register 2\u2019s customer started at 8:15.\n\nThen register 1\u2019s customer must have finished at 8:15.\n\nSo register 1\u2019s customer started at 8:00, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen register 2 opened at 8:15, and served a customer from 8:15 to 8:30.\n\nThen register 3 opened at 8:30, and served a customer from 8:30 to 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (since 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use (customer started at 8:30)\n\nBut the problem says: \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30.\n\nBut register 1 and 2 are free at 8:30.\n\nSo only register 3 is in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo it\u2019s impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 if the first customer finished at 8:15.\n\nUnless the first customer took longer.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 finishes at 8:45\n- Register 2 opens at 8:45\n- Register 2\u2019s customer: 8:45\u20139:30\n- Register 3 opens at 9:30\n\nBut then at 8:30, only register 1 is in use.\n\nRegister 2 and 3 are closed.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use at 8:30.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if:\n- Register 1: in use (started at 8:00, still going)\n- Register 2: in use (started at 8:15, still going)\n- Register 3: in use (started at 8:30)\n\nBut register 3 can only open when register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo register 2 must have become available before 8:30.\n\nSo register 2\u2019s customer finished before 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 opened before 8:30.\n\nBut register 2 opens when register 1 becomes available.\n\nSo register 1 must have become available before 8:30.\n\nSo register 1\u2019s customer finished before 8:30.\n\nSo register 1 is free at some time before 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30, register 1 is free.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use at 8:30.\n\nSo register 1 must be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 if the second register opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nUnless the registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming available.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read the passage:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nDoes it mean:\n- Register 2 opens when register 1 becomes available?\n- Or does it mean that register 2 opens when register 1 becomes available, but only if it\u2019s not in use?\n\nBut the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if:\n- Register 1: in use (started at 8:00)\n- Register 2: in use (started at 8:15)\n- Register 3: in use (started at 8:30)\n\nBut for register 3 to be in use at 8:30, it must have opened at 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 must have become available at 8:30.\n\nSo register 2\u2019s customer finished at 8:30.\n\nSo register 2\u2019s customer started at 8:15.\n\nSo register 2 opened at 8:15.\n\nSo register 1 must have become available at 8:15.\n\nSo register 1\u2019s customer finished at 8:15.\n\nSo register 1\u2019s customer started at 8:00.\n\nSo service time is 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00\u20138:15: register 1 in use\n- 8:15: register 2 opens\n- 8:15\u20138:30: register 2 in use\n- 8:30: register 3 opens\n- 8:30\u20138:45: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (since 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use (customer started at 8:30)\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if the first customer took longer than 30 minutes.\n\nBut then register 2 would open later.\n\nBut then register 3 would open even later.\n\nSo at 8:30, only one or two might be in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use.\n\nSo the only way this works is if the registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming available.\n\nPerhaps the passage means that the registers open at fixed times, but the second opens when the first becomes available, etc.\n\nBut that doesn't work.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first register is in use from 8:00.\n\nBut if the first register is in use from 8:00, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second register can't be in use at 8:30 unless the first customer took more than 30 minutes.\n\nBut then the second register opens after 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, only register 1 is in use.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00\u20138:30: register 1 in use\n- 8:30: register 2 opens\n- 8:30\u20139:00: register 2 in use\n- 9:00: register 3 opens\n- 9:00\u20139:30: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: in use (customer from 8:00\u20138:30)\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30, so can start at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo at 8:30, only two registers in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00\u20138:45: register 1 in use\n- 8:45: register 2 opens\n- 8:45\u20139:30: register 2 in use\n- 9:30: register 3 opens\n- 9:30\u201310:15: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30, only register 1 in use.\n\nSo only one.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30.\n\nUnless the registers are not opened sequentially.\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first register is in use from 8:00.\n\nBut if the first register is in use from 8:00, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second register can't be in use until after the first customer finishes.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only one or two might be in use.\n\nBut the problem says all three are in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes, the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 30 minutes.\n\nBut then:\n- 8:00\u20138:30: register 1 in use\n- 8:30: register 2 opens, starts at 8:30\n- 8:30\u20139:00: register 2 in use\n- 9:00: register 3 opens, starts at 9:00\n- 9:00\u20139:30: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: in use (8:00\u20138:30)\n- Register 2: in use (8:30\u20139:00)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00\u20138:15: register 1 in use\n- 8:15: register 2 opens\n- 8:15\u20138:30: register 2 in use\n- 8:30: register 3 opens\n- 8:30\u20138:45: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: free\n- Register 3: in use\n\nOnly one in use.\n\nSo never three in use at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if the first customer started at 8:00, the second at 8:15, the third at 8:30, and all are still in use.\n\nSo the first customer must have started at 8:00 and not finished by 8:30.\n\nSo service time > 30 minutes.\n\nBut then register 2 opens when register 1 becomes available, so after 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 not open at 8:30.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only logical explanation is that the registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming available.\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first register is in use from 8:00.\n\nBut if the first register is in use from 8:00, and the second opens when the first

are in use.\n\nSo not three.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00\u20138:45: register 1 in use\n- 8:45: register 2 opens\n- 8:45\u20139:30: register 2 in use\n- 9:30: register 3 opens\n- 9:30\u201310:15: register 3 in use\n\nAt 8:30, only register 1 in use.\n\nSo only one.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is if the registers are not opened sequentially.\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first register

took 15 minutes, the third took 15 minutes, and they all started at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only one is in use.\n\nSo never three.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the

An expert\u2014such as a business coach, financial advisor, or entrepreneur with relevant experience\u2014can offer data-driven insights, risk assessments, and strategic planning tools that a friend cannot.\n\nAdditionally, the question is not tied to a specific situation (e.g., \u201cShould I start a bakery in my hometown?\u201d), so it lacks specificity.
