If it is in check, it must move, block the check, or capture the threatening piece.  \n- You cannot make a move that puts the king in check.  \n\nSo, to attack the king:  \n1. Position a piece so it threatens the king.  \n2. Ensure the king is in check.  \n3. Force it to move or defend.  \n\nBut remember\u2014chess is a game of strategy, not just attack.
