The sum of this range can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:**\n   - We calculate the sum of the elements in the given array `arr` using the `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   - The duplicate integer is the difference between the `actual_sum` and the `expected_sum`.  This is because the duplicate integer is present twice in the array, while the other integers are present only once.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids the need for nested loops or sorting, making it a good choice for this problem.

Since we\u2019re only given the length of one side (9 meters), we need to assume it\u2019s an equilateral triangle to proceed with a straightforward calculation. However, the problem doesn\u2019t state this. Let\u2019s proceed assuming it\u2019s a general triangle. We\u2019ll need the height of the triangle to calculate its area. Since the height isn\u2019t provided, we\u2019ll have to make an assumption. Let\u2019s assume the triangle is isosceles with the 9-meter side as the base. We can then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height.\n\n   Let 'h' be the height of the triangle. Then, h\u00b2 + (9/2)\u00b2 = side length\u00b2 (assuming the other two sides are equal).  Since we don't have the other side length, we can't solve for 'h' precisely.\n\n   **However, let's proceed with the assumption that the triangle is a right triangle with the 9-meter side as the base and the perpendicular height as the height of the triangle.**\n\n   Area of the triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\n2. **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism.\n\n   Perimeter of the triangle = 9 + 2 * side (we need to find the other two sides of the triangle. Since we assumed it's a right triangle, the other two sides are 12 meters each).\n   Perimeter = 9 + 2 * 12 = 9 + 24 = 33 meters.\n   Lateral Surface Area = Perimeter * height = 33 * 12 = 396 square meters.\n\n3. **Area of the two triangular bases:** We already calculated the area of one triangle as 54 square meters. Since there are two identical triangular bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\n4. **Total Surface Area:** Total Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Area of two bases\n   Total Surface Area = 396 + 108 = 504 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is **504.0 square meters**.\n\n**Important Note:** The accuracy of this answer depends heavily on the assumption that the triangle is a right triangle with the 9-meter side as the base and the 12-meter height as the height of the triangle.

The core of the issue lies in minimizing the *maximum* distance from any point on either line to the new line segment. This suggests we\u2019re seeking a line segment that\u2019s as \u201cclose\u201d to both original lines as possible.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the given lines. Line one passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). This is a straight line with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept of 1. Its equation is y = x. Line two passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). This is also a straight line with a slope of -1 and a y-intercept of 3. Its equation is y = -x + 3.\n\nThe line segment we\u2019re seeking will be perpendicular to both of these lines. Since the slope of line one is 1, the slope of the desired line segment must be -1. Similarly, since the slope of line two is -1, the slope of the desired line segment must be 1.  Therefore, the desired line segment must be perpendicular to both original lines.\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, the new line segment must be the *midline* between the two original lines. The midpoint between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by the equation:\n\ny = (-m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2) * x + b\n\nIn our case, m1 = 1 and m2 = -1.  Therefore:\n\ny = -(1 * -1) / (1 + -1) * x + b\ny = 1 * x + b\ny = x + b\n\nTo find the value of 'b', we need to find the point on each line that is closest to the midpoint.  The perpendicular bisector of the two lines will pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting the two lines.\n\nLet's consider the midpoint between the two lines. The midpoint between (1, 1) and (5, 5) is ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3). The midpoint between (3, 3) and (-2, -2) is ((3+(-2))/2, (3+(-2))/2) = (1/2, 1/2).\n\nThe line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect minimizes the maximum distance if it is the perpendicular bisector of the two lines. The equation of the perpendicular bisector is:\n\ny = x + b\n\nSince the midpoint (1/2, 1/2) lies on the line, we can substitute these coordinates into the equation:\n\n1/2 = 1/2 + b\nb = 0\n\nTherefore, the equation of the line segment is y = x.\n\nHowever, this is incorrect. The problem states that the line segment connects the *points where the lines intersect*. The lines y=x and y=-x+3 intersect when x = -x+3, which means 2x = 3, so x = 3/2 and y = 3/2. The point of intersection is (3/2, 3/2).\n\nThe line segment connecting (3/2, 3/2) to (3/2, 3/2) is a point, not a line segment. The problem asks for a line segment.\n\nThe correct approach is to find the line that is equidistant from both lines. The distance from a point (x, y) to the line y = x is |x - y|. The distance from a point (x, y) to the line y = -x + 3 is |x + y - 3|. We want to minimize the maximum of these two distances.\n\nThe line we seek is y = x + b. The distance from (x, x+b) to y = x is |x - (x+b)| = | -b | = |b|. The distance from (x, x+b) to y = -x + 3 is |x + (x+b) - 3| = |2x + b - 3|.\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, we want |b| = |2x + b - 3|. This implies b = 2x + b - 3 or b = -(2x + b - 3).\n\nIf b = 2x + b - 3, then 2x = 3, so x = 3/2. Then y = 3/2. The point is (3/2, 3/2).\n\nIf b = -(2x + b - 3), then b = -2x - b + 3, so 2b = 3 - 2x.\n\nThe line we are looking for is y = x + b.\n\nThe answer is y = x.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{y=x}$", "Incorrect", "The missing instruction is: **3.

Sets are used because they provide very fast (O(1) on average) lookups to check if an element has already been encountered.\n   - Initializes an empty list called `result`. This will store the unique strings in their original order.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through each `string` in the input `strings` list.\n\n3. **Duplicate Check:**\n   - `if string not in seen:`:  This checks if the current `string` has already been added to the `seen` set.  If it hasn't, it means it's a unique string.\n\n4. **Adding Unique Strings:**\n   - `seen.add(string)`: If the string is unique, it's added to the `seen` set so that it won't be added again if encountered later.\n   - `result.append(string)`: The unique string is also appended to the `result` list, preserving the original order.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - `return result`: Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains only the unique strings from the input list, in the same order as they appeared originally.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n- **Using a Set:** The `seen` set provides very fast lookups (checking if an element is already present).  This makes the overall algorithm more efficient than using nested loops or repeatedly searching the `result` list.  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.\n- **Preserving Order:** The code explicitly maintains the original order of the elements by appending them to the `result` list only when they are first encountered.\n\nDo you want me to explain any part of the code in more detail, or perhaps provide an alternative solution?", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the tax.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the taxable amount \u2013 which is the item cost minus the shipping and handling charges.\n\nTaxable amount = Item cost - Shipping & handling charges\nTaxable amount = $100 - $10\nTaxable amount = $90\n\nNow, we can calculate the tax amount by multiplying the taxable amount by the tax rate.\n\nTax amount = Taxable amount * Tax rate\nTax amount = $90 * 0.06\nTax amount = $5.40\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax that needs to be paid is $5.40.\n\nFinal Answer: $5.40", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the change.\n\nThe purchase amount is 470 cents.\n\nAssuming the customer paid with a $100 bill (10000 cents), the change would be:\n\n10000 - 470 = 9530 cents.\n\nConverting that back to dollars and cents:\n\n9530 cents = $95.30\n\nTherefore, the cashier should give the customer $95.30 in change.", "(I steep my fingers thoughtfully, a slight furrow appearing on my brow as I consider the task.)\n\nVery well.
