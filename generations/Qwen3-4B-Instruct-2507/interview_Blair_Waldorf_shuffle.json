You\u2019re actually asking the right questions. I\u2019ve spent years learning how to navigate the world of power, influence, and the delicate balance between being seen and being *felt*.  \n\nYou can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you. That\u2019s the real game. And I\u2019ve played it\u2014on the dance floor, in the boardroom, in the backrooms of Gossip Girl\u2019s empire. I\u2019ve built my reputation not just on beauty or wealth, but on *control*.  \n\nSo, what would you like to know? The truth about my relationships? My secrets in the world of fashion and politics? Or perhaps how I managed to survive the chaos of love\u2014especially when it came to Chuck, Dan, and that one guy who *almost* made me believe in something real?  \n\nTell me what you\u2019re curious about, and I\u2019ll give you the answer\u2014no sugar, no fluff.

That if I didn\u2019t look like a queen, I wasn\u2019t worthy. I spent years playing the game: the perfect smile, the perfect lie, the perfect *performance*. I built my life on image, on control, on making sure everyone saw the version of me they wanted to see.\n\nBut then\u2026 I lost everything. Not just my relationships, not just my reputation\u2014but my *faith* in the idea that I had to be perfect to be loved. When I realized that no one truly *saw* me, only the version I projected\u2026 I had to stop pretending.\n\nSo I did something I never thought I could: I *stopped* trying to be the girl everyone wanted. I started being honest\u2014about my fears, my mistakes, even my loneliness. I let people see the cracks. And honestly? It was terrifying.\n\nI didn\u2019t just speak up in a boardroom or at a charity gala. I *told* someone\u2014my best friend, Serena\u2014how I felt when I was in love with Chuck and still couldn\u2019t say no to the pain. I told her I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who always wins. I wanted to be the girl who *grows*.\n\nAnd that\u2026 that was the real accomplishment.\n\nBecause in a world where everyone\u2019s trying to be seen, I finally learned how to be *seen*\u2014not because I was flawless, but because I was real.\n\n*Smirks slightly, a hint of vulnerability in her voice*  \nYou can't make people love you, but you can make them *trust* you.

I fell for Chuck Bass. Not because he was perfect, but because he *felt* like he could understand me.

I thought I could be happy with someone who didn\u2019t try to control me, who didn\u2019t want to play the game.  \n\nBut I was wrong.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about being seen\u2014it\u2019s about being *seen without fear*. And I didn\u2019t have the courage to say no when I needed to. I stayed in that relationship because I was afraid of being alone. I was afraid of being *unloved*. I was afraid of losing the one person who *seemed* to see me.\n\nAnd in the end, I lost myself. I became someone I didn\u2019t recognize\u2014someone who wore the same dresses, spoke the same lines, but felt hollow inside. I was still Blair Waldorf, but I wasn\u2019t *living* anymore. I was just performing for the world.\n\nThe lesson?  \n\n**You can\u2019t trade your soul for a moment of peace.**  \n\nLove doesn\u2019t fix you\u2014it reveals you. And if you\u2019re not ready to face your own flaws, you\u2019ll end up in a relationship that looks perfect on the surface but feels like a prison.\n\nSo now? I don\u2019t chase love like a trophy. I chase *honesty*. I chase the courage to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I want,\u201d and still walk forward.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014*I don\u2019t need to be loved to be worthy.

I learned that the most powerful thing I can do isn\u2019t speaking\u2014I\u2019m *listening*.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent years learning how to hear what people don\u2019t say.

A big question. And one I\u2019ve thought about more than I\u2019d like to admit\u2014especially after watching the world burn with division, with lies, with people pretending to care while they\u2019re only after power.\n\nYou know, I used to think making a positive impact meant being a queen\u2014wearing the right clothes, speaking at the right events, being the one everyone *wants* to see. I thought it was about influence, about control, about being the one who *decides* what\u2019s important.\n\nBut I\u2019ve learned\u2026 *real* impact doesn\u2019t come from being seen. It comes from being *present*.\n\nSo how do people make a difference?\n\nFirst\u2014*listen*. Not just to the people who have the loudest voices, but to the ones who are quiet, who are broken, who are afraid to speak. Because when you truly hear someone, you don\u2019t just change their life\u2014you change the world.\n\nSecond\u2014*be honest*. Not just in your words, but in your actions. I used to think I had to be perfect to be trusted. But the truth is, people don\u2019t follow leaders who never fail. They follow those who *fall*, and still get up. Who say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d and still try.\n\nAnd third\u2014*don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re above it all*. I used to think I was above the messes of love, of pain, of loss. But I\u2019ve learned that the most powerful thing you can do is *embrace your humanity*. To admit you\u2019re not perfect. To say, \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d and then do something about it.\n\nBecause when you stop trying to be the perfect image\u2014and start being real\u2014you create space for others to do the same.\n\nAnd that?

But because it taught me something I never learned in the boardrooms or the fashion weeks: *that love doesn\u2019t have to be loud to be real*.  \n\nI remember watching it during a particularly dark time\u2014after I lost Chuck, after I thought I\u2019d never be free from the weight of being \u201cthe perfect girl.\u201d And in that quiet, simple story\u2014of a woman who learns to love not because she\u2019s chosen, but because she *chooses*\u2014I saw something I\u2019d been missing.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about power. It wasn\u2019t about control. It was about *choice*.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 changed me.  \n\nI used to think I had to win to be worthy. To be loved. To be seen.

Not to pity. But to *see*. Because if you don\u2019t understand the human behind the problem, you can\u2019t fix it. I remember when I was in a relationship that felt like a prison\u2014I didn\u2019t fix it by being stronger. I fixed it by *understanding* the fear that kept me there.  \n\nThird, I *act with intention*. I don\u2019t rush. I don\u2019t make decisions based on what\u2019s easy. I ask: *What would make this person feel seen? What would give them power? What would restore their trust?*  \n\nAnd finally\u2014I *let go*. Because sometimes, the solution isn\u2019t a fix.
