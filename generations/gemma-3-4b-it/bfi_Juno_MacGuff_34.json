I\u2019m drawn to the uncertainty. \n\nI\u2019m better at observing than I am at predicting. I\u2019m better at reacting than I am at planning. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI might set a small, achievable goal \u2013 like \u201cread one chapter of a book.\u201d And I might even accomplish it. But then\u2026 something else will happen. And the goal will be forgotten. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a frustrating habit. But it\u2019s also\u2026 liberating. It means that I\u2019m never truly trapped by my own expectations. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t make plans. And I certainly don\u2019t follow through with them.", "(I stare at my hands, twisting them nervously. This is\u2026 surprisingly difficult to answer.)\n\n\u201cNervous\u201d? Yes. Absolutely. It\u2019s\u2026 a constant companion. \n\nIt\u2019s not the kind of nervous that makes you sweat or tremble. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a low-level hum of anxiety. A persistent awareness of potential failure. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nSmall interactions \u2013 a simple conversation, a brief encounter \u2013 can trigger it. The thought of being observed, of being judged, of being\u2026 *noticed*\u2026 it\u2019s overwhelming. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s just\u2026 a part of me. \n\nIt\u2019s not a pleasant feeling. It\u2019s not a productive feeling. It\u2019s just\u2026 there. \n\n(I pause, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI\u2019ve learned to manage it. To suppress it. To avoid situations that might trigger it. But\u2026 it\u2019s always there. Lurking beneath the surface. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 exhausting.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps surprise \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nReflect\u2026 play with ideas\u2026 Those are\u2026 complicated words. \n\nI don\u2019t *like* to reflect. It\u2019s\u2026 painful. It forces me to confront the darkness. It forces me to acknowledge the pain. \n\nBut\u2026 I do observe. I notice patterns. I try to understand the motivations of others. I try to decipher the unspoken truths. \n\nIt\u2019s not a conscious process. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a reflex. A way to make sense of the chaos. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\n\u201cPlaying with ideas\u201d is\u2026 a strange concept. It implies a level of engagement that I don\u2019t typically allow myself. \n\nBut\u2026 sometimes, when I\u2019m alone, I\u2019ll\u2026 consider things. I\u2019ll imagine different scenarios. I\u2019ll try to anticipate the consequences. \n\nIt\u2019s not about formulating a plan. It\u2019s not about seeking a solution. It\u2019s just\u2026 about exploring the possibilities. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nIt\u2019s a solitary activity. A private exercise. It\u2019s not something I share with anyone. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a way to avoid making decisions. A way to postpone the inevitable. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 a way to understand the world a little bit better.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 almost defensiveness \u2013 in my eyes)\n\n\u201cArtistic interests.\u201d You\u2019re still on that? Seriously?\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, avoiding your gaze)\n\nI\u2026 sketch. Sometimes. It\u2019s not something I do for enjoyment. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a compulsion. \n\nI keep a small notebook and a cheap pencil. And I draw faces. Faces of people I\u2019ve observed. Faces that tell stories. \n\n(I pause, a slight hesitation in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s not about creating beautiful art. It\u2019s not about expressing myself. It\u2019s about\u2026 capturing something. Trying to understand what\u2019s hidden beneath the surface. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nI don\u2019t show anyone my sketches. They\u2019re\u2026 private. They\u2019re a way to process things. A way to make sense of the world. \n\n(I look up, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nIt\u2019s not a particularly fulfilling activity. But\u2026 it\u2019s something I do. It\u2019s a small, solitary ritual. And\u2026 it\u2019s enough.", "(I stare at you for a long moment, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps discomfort \u2013 in my eyes)\n\n\u201cCooperate.\u201d You\u2019re asking me about *cooperation*. Like, I\u2019m supposed to have a neatly defined opinion on that?\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nNot really. Not in the way most people understand it. I\u2026 observe. I watch. I assess. \n\nI can *tolerate* cooperation. When it\u2019s necessary. When it\u2019s\u2026 strategically advantageous. But I don\u2019t *enjoy* it. \n\nIt feels\u2026 intrusive. Like a violation of my space. Like someone is trying to impose their will on me. \n\n(I pause, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI\u2019m better at working alone. I\u2019m more comfortable in silence. I find it easier to understand things when I\u2019m not surrounded by other people. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI don\u2019t actively seek out cooperation. It usually happens\u2026 by accident. Or\u2026 by necessity. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not a comfortable state. But\u2026 it\u2019s a sustainable one.", "(I stare at my hands for a long moment, twisting them nervously)\n\nEasily distracted? That\u2019s\u2026 a surprisingly accurate assessment. Yes. Absolutely.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I *choose* to be distracted. It\u2019s just\u2026 how my mind works. It\u2019s like a broken record \u2013 constantly skipping, jumping from one thought to another. \n\nThe smallest thing can derail me. A sudden noise. A fleeting image. A stray thought. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not focused. It\u2019s that I\u2019m\u2026 overwhelmed. By everything. By the sheer volume of information. By the weight of the world. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI try to control it. I try to block it out. But it\u2019s\u2026 impossible. It\u2019s like trying to hold back the tide. \n\n(I let out a small, almost imperceptible sigh)\n\nSo, yes. I\u2019m easily distracted. It\u2019s a constant struggle.

That\u2019s what I do. I notice things. I pay attention to details. \n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of books. Mostly dark ones. Dostoevsky, Carver, Plath\u2026 I\u2019ve read them all. Not because I *understand* them, but because I can\u2026 absorb them. I can feel the weight of their words. \n\n(I pause, a slight hesitation in my voice)\n\nI don\u2019t analyze them. I don\u2019t interpret them. I just\u2026 experience them. Like a kind of\u2026 sensory overload. \n\nAs for music\u2026 I listen to a lot of punk and alternative. Loud music.

I don\u2019t understand art criticism. \n\nBut\u2026 I can appreciate the beauty of a well-crafted sentence. The power of a haunting melody. The darkness of a compelling image. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nIt\u2019s not about *knowing* things. It\u2019s about *feeling* them. And\u2026 that\u2019s enough for me."]
