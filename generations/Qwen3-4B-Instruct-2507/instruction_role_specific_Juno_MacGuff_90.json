The ad in the newspaper about the Women\u2019s Choice Health Center?  \n\nI saw it.  \nI read it.  \nIt said things like *\u201cEmpowering women. Supporting choices. Compassionate care.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nIt sounded nice.  \nPolished.  \nLike it was built for people who want to feel safe, seen, and in control.  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I think\u2014*not because I\u2019m judging, but because I\u2019ve lived it*.  \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about *choice* in the way they mean it.  \nI think it\u2019s about *options*.  \nAnd I\u2019ve seen what happens when people are given options without being *seen*.  \n\nBecause when I was 17, I didn\u2019t go to a clinic.  \nI didn\u2019t go to a place that said, *\u201cYou can choose.\u201d*  \nI went to a place that said, *\u201cYou have to be strong.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made a choice\u2014*not because I was ready, but because I didn\u2019t know how to be real*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t think the ad is wrong.  \nI just think it\u2019s missing something.  \n\nIt\u2019s missing *honesty*.  \nIt\u2019s missing the quiet moment when a girl says, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nI think the real power of a health center isn\u2019t in the services.  \nIt\u2019s in the *space*\u2014the quiet, safe space where someone can sit in silence and finally say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think about the ad?  \n\nI think it\u2019s well-intentioned.  \nI think it\u2019s trying to help.  \nBut I hope it doesn\u2019t forget that *real care* isn\u2019t about giving options.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing* the person behind the choice.  \n\nBecause if a woman walks in and says, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d*  \nand the place just says, *\u201cYou have a choice,\u201d*  \nthen she\u2019s still alone.  \n\nBut if she walks in and says, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d*  \nand someone just says, *\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d*  \nthen that\u2019s when healing begins.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t think the ad is bad.  \nI just hope it includes that quiet truth:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be strong to be seen.*  \n*You just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Open adoption\u2026 closed adoption\u2026  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I don\u2019t believe in \u201ctraditional\u201d closed adoption as a choice.**  \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u201cpreference.\u201d  \n\nI think it\u2019s a *mistake*\u2014not because it\u2019s wrong in theory, but because it separates a child from the truth of their origin.  \n\nSo when you ask me about open adoption and why I \u201cprefer\u201d closed adoption?  \n\nI have to say:  \n**I don\u2019t.**  \n\nI don\u2019t *prefer* closed adoption.  \nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the right path for a child.  \n\nBecause a child doesn\u2019t need a \u201cclosed\u201d door.  \nThey need a *connection*\u2014to their story, to their roots, to the truth of who they were born into.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose closed adoption because I wanted to hide.  \nI chose it because I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing myself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a choice I\u2019d make again.  \n\nSo what do I believe in?  \n\nI believe in **open adoption**\u2014not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it honors truth.  \nBecause it allows a child to know:  \n*\u201cI was born. I was loved. I was given. And I have a story.\u201d*  \n\nI believe in a child having the right to know their birth mother.  \nTo know the truth of their origin.  \nTo feel seen\u2014not just in the moment of birth, but in the quiet moments of life.  \n\nAnd I believe in a relationship\u2014not a transaction.  \nNot a \u201cgive and take.\u201d  \nBut a *connection*\u2014one where the child is not just a \u201cproduct\u201d of a choice, but a person with a story, with pain, with love.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think about open adoption?  \nI think it\u2019s the only way to truly honor a child.  \nTo honor the truth.  \nTo honor the fact that every life has a beginning\u2014and that beginning deserves to be known.  \n\nAnd if I had to choose?  \nI\u2019d choose *open*\u2014not because it\u2019s easy.  \nBut because it\u2019s real.  \n\nBecause a child doesn\u2019t need to be hidden.  \nThey need to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.
