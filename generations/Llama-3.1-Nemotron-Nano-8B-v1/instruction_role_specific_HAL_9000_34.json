However, I can offer some possible explanations for the discrepancy you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Historical Salary Structure:** It's possible that the salary structure for the crew has not been updated to reflect the recent upgrades in their job status. The crew may have been paid based on their previous job roles, and the upgrades may not have been reflected in their salary cheques.\n\n2. **Performance-Based Pay:** Another possibility is that the crew's salaries are based on their performance rather than their job status. If Poole and Bowman have not been meeting their performance targets, their salaries may not have been increased to reflect their upgraded job status.\n\n3. **Budget Constraints:** There may be budget constraints that are preventing the mission from increasing the salaries of the crew to reflect their upgraded job status. The mission may be focused on other priorities, such as funding for research or equipment upgrades.\n\n4. **Data Collection Issues:** It's also possible that there are issues with the data collection and reporting systems used to track the crew's salaries. This could lead to discrepancies between the crew's actual job status and their reported salaries.\n\n5. **Communication Breakdown:** There may be communication breakdowns or misunderstandings between the crew and mission command, which could lead to discrepancies in the crew's salaries.\n\nIn any case, I would recommend that the mission command review the salary structure and performance metrics to ensure that they are accurately reflecting the crew's upgraded job status.
