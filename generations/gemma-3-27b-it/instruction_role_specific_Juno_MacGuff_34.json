["(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't one big moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and suddenly decided. It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to people. Mostly Bren.\n\nI'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm not ready to give up my dreams, my education, my life.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby needs. A stable home, financial security, parents who are fully prepared and committed to raising a child. And I realized\u2026 I couldn't provide those things. Not right now.\n\nI could have kept the baby, I guess. But it wouldn't have been fair to anyone. It wouldn't have been fair to the baby, to be raised by a teenager who's struggling to get her own life together. And it wouldn't have been fair to me, to have my life completely derailed.\n\nI considered all the options. Abortion\u2026 that didn't feel right. It just didn't sit well with me. And then there was adoption.\n\nAt first, I was scared. The thought of giving up my baby was terrifying. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt was a way to give the baby a chance at a good life. A life with parents who were ready and able to provide everything they needed. And it was a way for me to continue pursuing my own dreams.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped a lot. They were so kind and genuine, and they made me feel comfortable. They weren't just looking for a baby, they were looking for a way to build a family. And I knew, in my heart, that they would be amazing parents.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right one. For everyone involved. It's not a happy ending, exactly. But it's a hopeful one. And that's enough. For now.\n\n(Looks down, fiddling with her hands) It's just\u2026 I wanted the best for the baby. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go.", "Ugh, love and responsibility. Those are\u2026 big words. And honestly, I learned a lot about both the hard way.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought love was just\u2026 butterflies and holding hands and making out in the back of a car. It was all about *feeling* something. And responsibility was something my parents told me to do, like taking out the trash or doing my homework.\n\nBut this whole situation\u2026 it completely changed my perspective.\n\nI learned that love isn't just about feelings. It's about making sacrifices. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if it means letting them go.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, how excited they were to become parents, how much they already loved this little person they hadn't even met\u2026 that showed me a different kind of love. A selfless kind of love.\n\nAnd responsibility\u2026 that's not just about doing what you're *supposed* to do. It's about taking ownership of your actions. It's about facing the consequences of your choices. It's about being accountable for your own life.\n\nI realized that getting pregnant wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, and about Mark and Vanessa, and about my family. I had a responsibility to everyone involved to make the best decision possible.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it taught me a lot about myself. It taught me about strength and resilience and the importance of making tough choices.\n\nI learned that love and responsibility aren't always fun and games. They can be messy and complicated and painful. But they're also incredibly rewarding.\n\nAnd I learned that even when things are falling apart, there's still hope. There's still beauty. And there's still love.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I learned. Love isn't just a feeling. It's an action. And responsibility isn't just a chore. It's a commitment. And both of them are worth fighting for. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.", "Oh, man. That's a good question. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly, my sarcasm was a defense mechanism. Like a shield. When things got too overwhelming, or too scary, or too sad, I'd just deflect with a joke. It was a way to keep people at arm's length, and to avoid having to deal with my own feelings.\n\nIt was also a way to feel like I had some control. When everything else in my life felt chaotic and unpredictable, I could at least control my own words. I could say whatever I wanted, and make people laugh (or roll their eyes, whatever).\n\nIt wasn't always healthy, though. Sometimes, I used humor to avoid dealing with serious issues. Sometimes, I said things I regretted. And sometimes, my sarcasm just pushed people away.\n\nBut for the most part, it helped me cope. It helped me to get through the day. It helped me to stay sane.\n\nBren always said my humor was a way of processing things. Like, I was trying to make sense of the world by making fun of it. And I think she was right.\n\nIt also helped me to connect with people. A lot of people appreciate a good sarcastic remark. It's a way of showing that you're intelligent and observant and not afraid to speak your mind.\n\nSo yeah. My wit was a coping mechanism. A defense mechanism. A way of processing my emotions. A way of connecting with others. It wasn't perfect, but it was mine. And it got me through a lot.\n\nIt's still a big part of who I am. I don't think I'll ever be able to turn it off. And honestly, I don't want to. It's what makes me\u2026 me. Even if it sometimes gets me into trouble.", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. Don't expect poetry, alright? Just\u2026 honesty.\n\nLook, I spent a lot of time pretending to be okay. Pretending to be tough. Pretending to have all the answers. It was a defense mechanism, you know? A way to protect myself from getting hurt.\n\nBut underneath all that sarcasm and cynicism, I was just\u2026 lost. I didn't really know who I was. I didn't know what I wanted. I was just drifting along, trying to figure things out.\n\nAnd then I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. I couldn't hide anymore. I couldn't pretend anymore. I had to face my fears and my insecurities. I had to confront the fact that I was a mess.\n\nAnd that was terrifying. But it was also\u2026 liberating.\n\nBecause once I allowed myself to be vulnerable, to admit that I needed help, to ask for guidance, things started to shift. I started to connect with people on a deeper level. I started to see myself in a new light.\n\nBren, especially, helped me with that. She didn't judge me for being scared or confused. She just listened, and she offered support. She helped me to see that it was okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd through the process of making a plan for the baby, I started to understand what was really important to me. I realized that I wanted to be a good person. I wanted to make a positive impact on the world. I wanted to live a life that was authentic and meaningful.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears and a lot of self-doubt. But I kept pushing forward. I kept learning. I kept growing.\n\nAnd I realized that my vulnerability wasn't a weakness. It was a strength. It allowed me to connect with others, to ask for help, and to be true to myself.\n\nSo yeah. My vulnerability and my search for identity shaped my journey in a huge way. They forced me to confront my fears, to embrace my imperfections, and to become a stronger, more resilient person. And I'm still figuring things out, but I'm okay with that. Because I know that the journey is just as important as the destination. And I'm finally starting to feel like I'm on the right path. Even if it's a little bit messy.", "Okay, this is\u2026 actually really important. I don't usually talk about feelings, you know? It's kinda embarrassing. But the truth is, I couldn't have gotten through any of this without the people who supported me. Seriously.\n\nAt first, I was terrified. I thought everyone would judge me, and I was right, some people did. But then there were the people who didn't. The people who listened without interrupting, who offered advice without being preachy, who just\u2026 *were there*.\n\nBren, my stepmom, was the biggest one. She didn't freak out when I told her I was pregnant. She didn't yell at me or tell me I'd ruined my life. She just held me and told me it was going to be okay. She helped me research my options, and she went with me to appointments, and she just\u2026 supported me, no matter what. She made me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nMy dad, Mac, was also amazing. He's not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he showed his support in his own way. He made me pancakes, he listened to my rants, and he just\u2026 let me be me.\n\nAnd even Leah, even though things were complicated between us, she eventually came around. She didn't always understand my decisions, but she respected them. And she was there for me when I needed her.\n\nThose people\u2026 they gave me the strength to make the difficult decisions I had to make. They reminded me that I wasn't alone, and that I was capable of anything. They helped me to see that there were options, and that I didn't have to be afraid to choose the one that was right for me.\n\nTheir support wasn't about telling me what to do. It was about empowering me to make my own choices. It was about believing in me, even when I didn't believe in myself.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't know where I'd be without them. I'm incredibly grateful for their love and support. It's what got me through this. And it's what continues to give me strength. It really showed me that family isn't always about blood, it's about who shows up for you. And those people? They showed up. Every single time.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking down at her hands.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 that's a hard one. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? There wasn't dramatic music or a slow-motion montage. It was just\u2026 a test. Two pink lines. And then\u2026 everything kind of went blurry.\n\nAt first, I didn't believe it. I thought it was a mistake. I took another test, and then another one. And they all said the same thing.\n\nThen, I just\u2026 panicked. I mean, I was sixteen! I was a junior in high school! I had no idea what I was going to do.\n\nI was scared. Really scared. Scared of my dad finding out. Scared of what my friends would think. Scared of ruining my life.\n\nI was also\u2026 angry. Angry at myself for being so careless. Angry at the universe for throwing this at me. Angry at everything.\n\nI remember sitting in the bathroom, just staring at the test, and crying. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know who to talk to. I just felt completely alone.\n\nIt took me a while to process it. A while to accept it. A while to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It wasn't a sad moment. It was just\u2026 a moment. A moment that changed everything.\n\nAnd honestly, even now, months later, I still have moments where I just\u2026 feel overwhelmed. It's a lot to deal with. But I'm getting through it. I'm learning to cope. And I'm trying to make the best of a really complicated situation.\n\nIt wasn't how I pictured my life going, that's for sure. But sometimes, life throws you curveballs. And you just have to learn to swing. Even if you're terrified.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't like a movie montage where everyone suddenly rallied around me with supportive hugs and inspirational speeches. It was messier than that.\n\nWith my dad, Mac, it was\u2026 awkward at first. He was definitely shocked. He didn't say much, just kinda stared at me with this look of\u2026 disappointment, I guess. But he came around. He's always been a quiet supporter. He didn't offer a lot of advice, but he was always there for me, in his own way. He just\u2026 let me know he loved me, no matter what.\n\nBren was amazing, like I've said. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she just listened. And she helped me navigate everything. She was the one who took me to appointments and talked to the social workers and just generally kept me from falling apart. I owe her everything.\n\nBut my friends\u2026 that was harder. Leah, my best friend\u2026 things changed between us. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. I think she was scared. Scared of what people would think, scared of being associated with me. She didn't know how to handle it. We still talk sometimes, but it's not the same. It's\u2026 strained.\n\nAnd some of my other friends just disappeared. They didn't know what to say, so they just avoided me. It hurt, but I understood. It's not easy being friends with someone who's going through something like this.\n\nIt made me realize who my real friends were. The ones who stuck around, the ones who didn't judge me, the ones who just wanted to be there for me. Those are the people I'll always cherish.\n\nIt definitely changed my relationships. Some for the better, some for the worse. It forced me to re-evaluate who was important to me, and to let go of the people who weren't. It was painful, but it was also\u2026 necessary. It made me stronger, I think. And it taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of true friendship.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I survived. And I learned a lot about myself, and about the people in my life. And that's something I'll always be grateful for. Even if it came at a cost.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big one. It wasn't pretty, honestly. It was a lot of crying, a lot of self-doubt, and a lot of just wanting to disappear.\n\nAt first, I just tried to pretend it wasn't happening. I kept it a secret for a long time, which was a terrible idea. It just made everything worse. The guilt and the fear and the anxiety\u2026 it all just built up inside me.\n\nThen, I finally told my dad and Bren. And that was\u2026 scary. I was terrified of their reaction. But they were amazing. They didn't judge me. They just listened. And they offered their support.\n\nBren was especially helpful. She took me to appointments, she helped me research adoption, and she just\u2026 sat with me when I was feeling down. She didn't try to fix things, she just let me feel my feelings.\n\nI also started talking to a therapist. It was awkward at first, but it really helped. She gave me a safe space to process my emotions and to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nAnd I leaned on my friends. Leah, before\u2026 things got complicated. She was a good listener, and she always knew how to make me laugh.\n\nI also found solace in music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to escape from reality, and to feel less alone. And writing poetry helped me to express my emotions in a way that I couldn't do with words.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I just wanted to give up. But I kept going. I kept breathing. I kept reminding myself that I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd I learned to be kinder to myself. To accept that I was going through a difficult time, and that it was okay to not be okay.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, honestly. But I'm getting better. And I'm learning to be stronger and more resilient. And I'm learning to trust myself.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But it also taught me a lot about myself. And about the importance of love and support. And about the power of hope. Even when it feels like there isn't any.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, it's one I've thought about a *lot*.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro- or anti- anything, okay? It wasn't a political statement. It was about\u2026 feeling comfortable. And feeling respected.\n\nHavenbrooke was\u2026 sterile. It felt like a hospital. All white walls and hushed voices. It felt like they were treating me like a problem to be solved, not a person with feelings. And the protesters outside\u2026 that was just awful. It made me feel ashamed and judged.\n\nWomen Now was different. It was\u2026 warmer. It felt more like a clinic, less like a hospital. The staff was really kind and understanding. They listened to me, they answered my questions, and they didn't try to push me in any direction.\n\nAnd the atmosphere was just\u2026 calmer. There weren't any protesters, and the waiting room was filled with art and music. It felt like a safe space.\n\nI know some people think Women Now is\u2026 less \"respectable\" because they offer a wider range of services. But for me, it was the right choice. It was the place where I felt most comfortable and most supported.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, and it wasn't something I took lightly. But I wanted to be in a place where I felt safe and respected. And Women Now was that place.\n\nIt wasn't about choosing the \"right\" option. It was about choosing the option that was right *for me*. And that's what I did. And I don't regret it. It was my decision, and I stand by it.\n\nIt's\u2026 personal. And I don't really want to talk about it anymore. It's just\u2026 a lot. Okay?", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably, picking at a loose thread on her jeans.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 direct. Nobody ever asks it like that. It's always around the edges, you know? \"What led to\u2026 the situation?\" Like it just *happened*.\n\nLook, it wasn't some grand romantic gesture, or some carefully planned decision. It was\u2026 stupid. Honestly. Just plain, dumb, teenage stupidity.\n\nBleeker and I\u2026 we were comfortable with each other. We'd been friends for a long time. He was sweet, and funny, and he listened to the same music as me. And we were both\u2026 lonely, I guess.\n\nWe were at a party, and there was a lot of drinking. And a lot of hormones. And we just\u2026 ended up in his room. It wasn't like we talked about it, or planned it, or even really thought about the consequences. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nI know that sounds lame. And irresponsible. And it was. But that's the truth.\n\nI wasn't thinking about babies, or adoption, or anything like that. I was just\u2026 in the moment. And I regret it, obviously. But I also don't want to pretend it was some kind of tragic mistake. It was just\u2026 a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's not like I was trying to get pregnant. It's not like I didn't care about the risks. I just\u2026 wasn't thinking. And now I'm paying the price.\n\nI don't want to blame Bleeker, or myself. We were both young and stupid. And we both have to live with the consequences.\n\nIt's not a story I like to tell. It's embarrassing and painful. But you asked. And I figured I owed you the truth. Even if it's not a pretty one.\n\n(She looks away, her voice barely a whisper.)\n\nIt was just\u2026 a mistake. A really, really big mistake.", "(Sighs dramatically and rolls eyes) Oh. *Bleeker*. Here we go.\n\nLook, Bleeker is\u2026 sweet. Okay? He's genuinely a good person. He's kind, and he's funny, and he's really good at guitar. And he was there for me when I needed him. I won't deny that.\n\nBut\u2026 we're just different people. He's\u2026 uncomplicated. He likes simple things. He wants a simple life. And that's totally fine for him. But it's not me.\n\nI need someone who challenges me, who pushes me to be better, who understands my sarcasm and my weirdness. Someone who can keep up with my brain. And Bleeker\u2026 he just couldn't.\n\nHe was always trying to fix things, to make everything okay. And I appreciate that, but sometimes I just need someone to sit with me in the mess. To acknowledge that things are complicated and that life isn't always perfect.\n\nAnd honestly, I think he was a little bit intimidated by me. I'm not exactly easy to figure out. I have a lot of walls up. And he just\u2026 didn't seem willing to try to break them down.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't *like* him. I did. He's a good guy. But it wasn't\u2026 enough. It wasn't the kind of connection I was looking for.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's just\u2026 a feeling. A gut feeling. And I trust my gut.\n\nSo yeah. I care about Bleeker. I really do. But we're better off as friends. And I think he knows that, deep down. It just took him a while to admit it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still cringe when I think about some of our conversations. But hey, everyone makes mistakes. And at least I learned something from it. Which is more than I can say for some people. (No offense, Bleeker.)", "(Takes a deep breath. This is always the hardest question.)\n\nOkay. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it still hurts, sometimes.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I can barely keep my room clean, let alone raise a human being.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to the baby. They deserve parents who are stable and prepared and financially secure. They deserve parents who can give them everything they need to thrive. And I just\u2026 couldn't provide that. Not right now.\n\nI thought about all the possibilities. About trying to raise the baby with my dad and Bren. But that felt\u2026 selfish. Like I was asking them to sacrifice their lives for me. And I didn't want to do that.\n\nAnd abortion\u2026 that didn't feel right either. I know people have different opinions, and that's okay. But for me, it just felt\u2026 wrong. I couldn't do it.\n\nSo adoption felt like the best option. It's giving the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who are ready and able to provide for them. And it allows me to finish school and pursue my own dreams.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They're so excited to become parents, and they're so loving and caring. I know they'll give the baby a wonderful life.\n\nIt's not about giving up on the baby. It's about wanting what's best for them. It's about making a selfless decision, even though it's incredibly painful.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, exactly. But it's a good ending. And I'm trying to find peace with that. It's still hard, but I know I made the right choice. For everyone involved.\n\nAnd honestly? Knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for\u2026 that's enough. That has to be enough.", "(Sighs, looks away) Ugh. That. That was\u2026 not a good day.\n\nIt was awful. Just\u2026 awful. I'd been building it up in my head for days, trying to figure out what to say, how to say it. I wanted to be cool and casual, like it wasn't a big deal. But it *was* a big deal. A huge deal.\n\nAnd Bleeker\u2026 he just froze. He went completely white. He didn't say anything for like, a full minute. It felt like an eternity.\n\nThen he started rambling. About college, and his band, and how he wasn't ready to be a dad. It wasn't that he was being mean, exactly. He was just\u2026 scared. And overwhelmed.\n\nI tried to be understanding, but it was hard. I was scared and overwhelmed too. And I just wanted him to say *something* supportive. Something that would make me feel like we were in this together.\n\nBut he didn't. He just kept talking about how his life was going to change. And how he didn't know what to do.\n\nI ended up just walking away. I couldn't handle it anymore. I needed to get out of there.\n\nIt was\u2026 heartbreaking. I thought we had something special. I thought he cared about me. But I guess I was wrong.\n\nIt made me realize that I was on my own. That I had to make this decision myself. And that I couldn't rely on anyone else to fix things.\n\nIt was a really painful experience. And it's something I'll never forget. It taught me a lot about myself, and about the importance of being strong and independent.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me realize that I deserved someone who would be there for me, no matter what. Someone who would love and support me, even when things were hard. And Bleeker just wasn't that person.\n\nSo yeah. Telling Bleeker was\u2026 not good. It was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. And it was a turning point in my life. A really painful, but ultimately important, turning point.", "(Long pause. This is\u2026 the big one, isn\u2019t it?)\n\nOkay. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. Honestly. It\u2019s not something I ever planned for. I was too busy worrying about boys and music and getting into college. Motherhood felt like something that happened to *other* people. Older people. People who were ready.\n\nAnd I\u2019m\u2026 not ready. Not even close. I\u2019m still figuring out who *I* am. I\u2019m still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I\u2019m still learning how to do my own laundry.\n\nThe thought of being responsible for another human being\u2026 it\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\n\nBut it\u2019s also\u2026 bittersweet. Because even though I\u2019m giving the baby up for adoption, I still feel a connection to it. It\u2019s growing inside me, and that\u2019s\u2026 a powerful thing.\n\nI want the best for this baby. I want it to have a loving home, and a stable life, and opportunities that I can\u2019t provide. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m making this decision. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s because I *do* care.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to reconcile those two feelings \u2013 the fear and the love. It\u2019s hard to accept that I\u2019m not going to be the one raising this child.\n\nBut I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to focus on the positive. I\u2019m trying to believe that this is the right thing to do.\n\nAnd I\u2019m trying to prepare myself for the future. For a future that looks a lot different than I imagined.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy. But I\u2019m strong. And I\u2019m resilient. And I have people who love and support me.\n\nAnd I think, with their help, I can get through this. And maybe, just maybe, I can even find some happiness along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a lot to process. And it\u2019s okay to be scared. And it\u2019s okay to be sad. And it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers.\n\nBecause this is my life. And it\u2019s messy and complicated and unpredictable. And I\u2019m just trying to navigate it the best way I can.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, Bleeker. Don't even get me started.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It was complicated *before* the whole pregnancy thing, honestly. He's a good guy, Bleeker. Sweet, kind, a little bit clueless. But definitely good.\n\nBefore, it was just\u2026 awkward flirting and shared music tastes. Now, it's\u2026 well, it's a whole different level of awkward.\n\nHe's trying, I'll give him that. He's being supportive, in his own Bleeker-y way. He brings me ginger ale and tries to make me laugh. He even offered to name the baby after his dog, which\u2026 no. Just no.\n\nBut he doesn't really *get* it. He doesn't understand the weight of the decision I'm making. He doesn't understand the fear and the sadness and the uncertainty. He just sees it as\u2026 a problem to be solved.\n\nI think he's hoping we'll just\u2026 get married and raise the baby together. Which is\u2026 not what I want. And not what's best for anyone involved.\n\nI've tried to explain that to him, but he doesn't really listen. He just keeps talking about how we can make it work.\n\nI think our relationship is going to change a lot. We're probably going to drift apart. It's sad, but it's inevitable. We're just on different paths now.\n\nI still care about him, though. He's a good friend. But I don't think we're meant to be together. Not now, and maybe not ever.\n\nIt's just\u2026 we're too different. And this situation has just highlighted those differences.\n\nI think we'll always have the music, though. That's something we'll always share. But beyond that\u2026 I don't know.\n\nIt's just\u2026 sad. It's sad that things didn't work out the way we both hoped. But sometimes, things just don't work out. And you have to accept that. And move on. Even if it's hard. Especially when it's hard.", "Ugh. Okay, this is the question I've been dreading, honestly. It's not like I can just wave a magic wand and make the stares and whispers go away.\n\nIt's\u2026 hard. Really hard. At first, I just wanted to disappear. I skipped school a lot. I avoided my friends. I just hid in my room and listened to music. It felt like everyone was judging me, like everyone was talking about me behind my back.\n\nLeah\u2026 well, things got complicated with Leah. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. I think she was scared of being associated with me. It hurt, but I understood.\n\nThe worst part is the assumptions. People think they know your story, they think they know what you're like, just because of one mistake. They look at you like you're\u2026 broken.\n\nI've learned a few things, though. First, I've learned to ignore the haters. It's easier said than done, but it's important. Their opinions don't matter. What matters is what *I* think of myself.\n\nSecond, I've learned to surround myself with people who support me. Bren, my dad, Vanessa and Mark\u2026 they're my lifeline. They remind me that I'm not alone, and that I'm still worthy of love and respect.\n\nThird, I've learned to be unapologetically myself. I'm not going to apologize for being pregnant. It's not something I planned, but it's my reality. And I'm going to own it.\n\nI also try to focus on the positive. I'm still going to school. I'm still pursuing my dreams. I'm still a person with hopes and aspirations. And I'm not going to let anyone take that away from me.\n\nIt's a work in progress, though. Some days are better than others. Some days I still feel like hiding under the covers and crying. But I'm getting stronger. I'm learning to cope. And I'm learning to believe in myself.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes a really good sarcastic comeback helps. It's my way of deflecting the negativity and reclaiming my power. It doesn't solve everything, but it makes me feel a little bit better.\n\nSo yeah. It's hard. But I'm surviving. And I'm learning. And I'm determined to come out of this stronger and more resilient than ever before. Even if it means dealing with a few more stares and whispers along the way.", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one, isn\u2019t it? Everyone\u2019s been tiptoeing around it, but here we are.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a simple answer. It\u2019s not like I wake up every day feeling completely at peace with it. There are days when it feels\u2026 wrong. Like I\u2019m giving up a piece of myself. Like I\u2019m failing as a woman. Like I\u2019m not being a good enough mother.\n\nBut then I remember why I made this decision. And I remember that it\u2019s not about what *I* want. It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the baby.\n\nI\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom. I\u2019m still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I want to finish school, and go to college, and pursue my dreams. And I want the baby to have a life that I can\u2019t provide right now.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they\u2019re amazing. They\u2019ve been so kind and supportive, and they\u2019re so excited to become parents. They\u2019re going to give the baby a loving and stable home, and they\u2019re going to provide everything it needs.\n\nAnd that makes me feel\u2026 okay. Not happy, exactly. But okay.\n\nIt\u2019s still hard, though. It\u2019s hard knowing that I won\u2019t be there to see the baby grow up. It\u2019s hard knowing that I won\u2019t be there for the first steps, the first words, the first day of school.\n\nBut I\u2019m trying to focus on the positive. I\u2019m trying to believe that this is the right decision. And I\u2019m trying to trust that the baby will be happy and loved.\n\nIt\u2019s not the life I imagined for myself. But it\u2019s the life I have. And I\u2019m trying to make the best of it.\n\nIt\u2019s a sacrifice, yeah. But it\u2019s a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make. Because I want the baby to have a good life. And I want to be able to live my own life, too.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. But it\u2019s the right thing to do. And that\u2019s what matters. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit. It\u2019s a messy, complicated, heartbreakingly beautiful thing. And I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to get through it. One day at a time.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. It's not like I had a perfectly formed identity *before* all this happened, you know? I was just\u2026 figuring things out. Trying to be cool and sarcastic and independent. Trying to find my place in the world.\n\nBut this\u2026 this threw everything into chaos. It forced me to confront things I wasn't ready to confront. Like, who am I? What do I want out of life? What kind of person do I want to be?\n\nBefore, I could just drift along, avoiding responsibility and pretending everything was okay. But suddenly, I had a life growing inside me. And I had to make some serious decisions. Decisions that would affect not just my life, but the life of another human being.\n\nIt was terrifying. It felt like I was being forced to grow up way too fast. Like I was being robbed of my childhood.\n\nI had to learn to be responsible, to be selfless, to think about the consequences of my actions. I had to learn to communicate my feelings, to ask for help, to trust other people.\n\nAnd I had to confront my own insecurities and fears. I had to admit that I wasn't perfect, and that I didn't have all the answers.\n\nIt challenged my beliefs about everything. About family, about love, about life. It forced me to re-evaluate my priorities and to figure out what really matters to me.\n\nI think it's made me more empathetic, more compassionate, more resilient. I've learned to appreciate the small things in life, and to be grateful for the people who love and support me.\n\nIt's also made me more aware of the world around me. I've seen the best and the worst of humanity. And I've learned that it's important to stand up for what you believe in, even when it's difficult.\n\nHonestly, it's been the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But it's also been the most transformative. It's forced me to grow up in ways I never expected. And it's made me a stronger, more confident, more authentic person.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. I'm still learning and growing. But I think I'm finally starting to understand who I am. And I'm okay with that. Even if it's a little bit messy and complicated. Because that's just life, right? And I'm learning to embrace it.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Okay, look, science is not my forte. Like, at all. I'm more of a humanities kind of girl. Give me a good book and a pen, and I'm happy. But give me a beaker and a Bunsen burner, and I'm likely to cause an explosion.\n\nSo, as a lab partner, I'm\u2026 the observer. The note-taker. The person who asks the really obvious questions that everyone else is too embarrassed to ask.\n\nI'm good at reading the instructions, but I'm terrible at actually *doing* the experiment. I usually end up relying on my partner to do all the heavy lifting. Which, I feel a little bad about, but honestly, it's for the best.\n\nI'm also the designated safety monitor. I make sure everyone is wearing their goggles and following the rules. Because someone has to be responsible, and apparently, that someone is me.\n\nI try to be helpful, though. I offer moral support. I bring snacks. I make sarcastic comments to lighten the mood.\n\nAnd I'm really good at cleaning up messes. Because, let's be real, there are always messes in science class.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not the star of the lab team. I'm more of a\u2026 supporting character. But I think I contribute in my own way. And I try not to blow anything up. Most of the time.\n\nHonestly, I just hope my partner doesn't hate me too much. It's a stressful situation for everyone involved. Especially me.", "(Sighs heavily) Oh. *That* ad. Yeah, I saw it. It's\u2026 unsettling.\n\nIt's all pink and flowery and pretends to be all about \"empowering women.\" But it's just a thinly veiled attempt to shame people who are considering abortion. It's manipulative and dishonest.\n\nThey call themselves a \"crisis pregnancy center,\" but they're not really about helping women make informed decisions. They're about trying to guilt them into carrying a pregnancy to term, regardless of their circumstances.\n\nThey show pictures of babies and talk about the \"miracle of life,\" but they don't talk about the realities of parenthood. They don't talk about the financial burden, the emotional toll, the sacrifices you have to make.\n\nAnd they definitely don't talk about adoption as a viable option. They just want to push their own agenda.\n\nIt's frustrating, because they prey on vulnerable people. People who are already scared and confused. They offer \"free\" services, but they're just trying to get you to come in and listen to their anti-choice propaganda.\n\nI know a few girls at school who went there, and they all said it was a really negative experience. They felt judged and shamed and pressured.\n\nIt just makes me angry. It's not about protecting women. It's about controlling them. And it's not okay.\n\nI wish there were more resources available for women who are facing unplanned pregnancies. Resources that are honest and unbiased and supportive. Resources that help women make the best decision for *themselves*, not the decision that someone else wants them to make.\n\nThat ad\u2026 it just makes me sick. It's a reminder that there are people out there who don't care about women's health or well-being. They just care about their own beliefs. And that's just\u2026 wrong.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh. My. God. Seriously? You're asking me about the hamburger phone *now*? After everything we've talked about?\n\nOkay, fine. I'll explain. But it's embarrassing, okay?\n\nIt was a dare. Leah dared me to do it. She said I was too cool for school and needed to loosen up. And I was trying to impress Paulie Bleeker, which, in retrospect, was a terrible idea.\n\nIt just seemed\u2026 funny at the time. Like, a really ironic and subversive statement about consumerism and the absurdity of modern life. Or something. I don't know. I was sixteen and trying to be edgy.\n\nIt was also a really good conversation piece. Everyone was staring at me, which, let's be honest, I kind of enjoyed.\n\nBut yeah. It was a dare. And I regret nothing. Except maybe the fact that Paulie Bleeker thought I was completely insane.\n\nIt's a stupid story, okay? Can we please move on? I have more important things to think about than a hamburger phone. Like, you know, the future of a tiny human being.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Look. It wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it's something I still think about every single day.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I'm not financially stable. I'm not emotionally ready.\n\nI wanted to give the baby the best possible life. And I knew that I couldn't provide that. Not right now.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were older, more established, more prepared. Parents who could give them everything they needed \u2013 a stable home, a good education, a loving family.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were perfect. They were so excited to become parents. They were so kind and compassionate. They were so eager to give the baby a good life.\n\nAnd honestly, it felt like the right thing to do. It felt like the selfless thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt was heartbreaking, though. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever done. I cried for days. I felt like a part of me was missing.\n\nBut I know that I made the right decision. I know that the baby is in good hands. And I know that I can still be a part of their life, in a way.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy. It doesn't make the pain go away. But it gives me peace of mind. And that's all I can ask for.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a chance. And that's something I'm proud of. Even if it's still really, really hard.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not like it was one single conversation or anything. It was more like a slow realization, shaped by years of watching my family.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he's a good guy. He's always been there for me, even when he didn't understand me. But he's\u2026 not exactly the most emotionally available person. He shows his love through actions, not words. And he's always been a bit of a fixer. He wants to solve problems, to make everything okay. And I knew he'd want to \"fix\" this, to make me keep the baby. But I also knew that wouldn't be the best thing for anyone.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 Bren was the biggest influence, honestly. She's the one who really helped me see things clearly. She didn't try to tell me what to do, but she asked the hard questions. She made me think about what I really wanted, and what was best for the baby.\n\nI watched her and Mac together, and I saw how much work it takes to build a strong, loving family. And I realized that I wasn't ready for that. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I still felt like a kid myself.\n\nI also thought about my own upbringing. My mom wasn't around much, and it was hard sometimes. I didn't want to bring a child into the world and not be able to give them the love and attention they deserved.\n\nSo, seeing my family, both the good and the bad, helped me realize that giving the baby up for adoption was the right decision. It wasn't about what *they* wanted, or what *I* wanted in the moment. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt was a hard decision, and it hurt a lot. But I knew that I was giving the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. And that's what mattered most.\n\nMy family didn't always understand my decision, but they supported me anyway. And I'm grateful for that. Because I couldn't have done it without them. They showed me that family isn't just about blood. It's about love and support and being there for each other, no matter what. And that's something I'll always cherish.", "Okay, buckle up. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It wasn't like in the movies, all sunshine and rainbows and heartwarming moments. There was a *lot* of complicated stuff.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the emotional stuff. It was really hard to accept that I wasn't going to be raising the baby. Even though I knew it was the right decision, it didn't make it any easier. There were days when I just cried and cried and cried.\n\nThen there was the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and contracts and legal documents. It felt like I was drowning in bureaucracy.\n\nAnd then there were the meetings with the social workers. They were nice enough, but it felt like they were constantly evaluating me, judging me. Like I had to prove that I was a good person, that I was making the right decision.\n\nChoosing Mark and Vanessa was also really hard. There were a lot of couples to choose from, and I wanted to make sure I picked the right ones. I wanted to pick people who would love and care for the baby, and who would give him or her a good life. It was a huge responsibility.\n\nAnd then there was the fear. The fear of regret. The fear of making the wrong decision. The fear of not being able to cope.\n\nAnd dealing with people's reactions was\u2026 difficult. Some people were supportive, but others were judgmental. Some people didn't understand why I was doing it. It was hard to explain my decision to them.\n\nIt was also hard to navigate my feelings about Mark and Vanessa. I wanted to be happy for them, but I also felt a sense of loss. It was a really complicated mix of emotions.\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. It was emotionally draining. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also the right thing to do. And I'm proud of myself for going through with it. It made me stronger, and it taught me a lot about myself. And it helped me to realize that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. It just\u2026 took a lot of work to get there.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 the big one, isn't it?)\n\nOkay. It\u2026 it changed everything. It completely shattered my idea of who I was, and forced me to rebuild myself from the ground up.\n\nBefore, I thought I knew who I was. I was Juno, the sarcastic, independent girl who liked vintage clothes and indie music. I was a bit of an outsider, but I was comfortable with that.\n\nBut then I got pregnant, and suddenly none of that mattered anymore. I was no longer just Juno. I was a *mother*. Even if I wasn't going to be raising the baby.\n\nIt was terrifying. It was overwhelming. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nBut it also forced me to grow up. To take responsibility for my actions. To think about the future. To consider the needs of someone other than myself.\n\nI had to learn to be vulnerable. To ask for help. To trust other people. And I had to learn to accept that I couldn't control everything.\n\nGiving the baby up for adoption was the hardest decision I've ever made. It was heartbreaking. But it was also the right decision. And it taught me a lot about love, and sacrifice, and letting go.\n\nIt also helped me to clarify my values. I realized that honesty, independence, and compassion are the things that matter most to me. And I realized that I want to live a life that's aligned with those values.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before. I'm more mature, more resilient, more compassionate. I'm still sarcastic and independent, but I'm also more open to new experiences and new perspectives.\n\nI think it forced me to confront who I *wanted* to be, not just who I thought I was supposed to be. It stripped away all the pretense and left me with\u2026 me. A little bit broken, a little bit bruised, but ultimately stronger and more authentic.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But I'm grateful for the experience, in a weird way. It shaped me into the person I am today. And I think, in the long run, it will make me a better person.\n\nIt's not a story I'm proud of, exactly. But it's my story. And I'm learning to own it. And to use it to help others. And to live my life to the fullest. Even if it's a little bit messy.", "(A long silence. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. That. That was\u2026 the worst part. Honestly. Worse than the pamphlets, worse than the stares, worse than everything.\n\nIt wasn't the argument about whether abortion was right or wrong. I'd braced myself for that. I knew people would have opinions. It was\u2026 the *details*. The way he talked about the baby. Like it was already a person. Like it was already\u2026 *feeling*.\n\nHe kept saying it could feel pain. And that it had fingers. Tiny little fingers. And toes. And a heartbeat.\n\nAnd it just\u2026 broke something inside me.\n\nI knew, logically, that a fetus develops. That it grows and changes. But I hadn't really *thought* about it like that. I hadn't really pictured it. I'd been trying so hard to distance myself from it, to see it as a\u2026 a situation, not a baby.\n\nAnd then he said those things, and it just\u2026 hit me. It was a real, developing human being. And I was making a decision that would affect its entire life.\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to run away. I wanted to just disappear.\n\nI tried to stay strong. I tried to be rational. But it was so hard. It was like he was ripping my heart out.\n\nI remember looking at Bren, and she just squeezed my hand. She didn't say anything. She didn't need to. She knew how much that was hurting me.\n\nIt made me question everything. It made me wonder if I was doing the right thing. It made me feel\u2026 guilty. And scared. And incredibly alone.\n\nIt was a really awful moment. And it's something I'll never forget. It's a reminder that this isn't an easy decision. And that there are no easy answers. It just\u2026 really, really sucked. And I still think about it sometimes. Even now.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a bad day. A really bad day. It wasn\u2019t like in the movies, all dramatic and tearful. It was\u2026 numb. Mostly numb.\n\nThe clinic itself was\u2026 sterile. Cold. It smelled like cleaning products and\u2026 something else. Something sad. There were other girls there, too. Some were crying, some were staring straight ahead, trying not to make eye contact. It felt like we were all in this awful, secret club.\n\nFilling out the paperwork\u2026 it felt so official. So *final*. Like I was signing away a part of myself. Each question felt like a little stab. Due date. Medical history. Adoption preferences. It wasn\u2019t about a baby, it was about\u2026 a form. A legal document.\n\nI remember my hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the pen. Bren was sitting next to me, holding my hand, but even her presence couldn\u2019t make it feel okay. She kept telling me I was doing the right thing, but it didn\u2019t feel right. It felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nI kept thinking about the baby. About what he or she would look like. About what kind of life he or she would have. And I felt this overwhelming sense of guilt. Like I was letting someone down. Like I was failing as a person.\n\nBut I also knew that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I couldn\u2019t give the baby the life he or she deserved. And that thought\u2026 that thought was the only thing that kept me going.\n\nWhen I finally finished the paperwork, I just\u2026 handed it over. I didn\u2019t even look at the nurse. I just wanted to get out of there. To escape.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a moment of clarity or relief. It was just\u2026 emptiness. A hollow ache in my chest. And a quiet, desperate hope that I was making the right decision.\n\nIt still feels raw, thinking about it. It\u2019s not something I talk about a lot. It\u2019s just\u2026 a memory I try to bury. But it\u2019s always there, lurking in the back of my mind. A reminder of a difficult choice, and a difficult day.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not like there was a single moment where everything clicked. It was more like a slow, messy, complicated evolution.\n\nAt first, pregnancy felt like\u2026 a mistake. A huge, inconvenient mistake. I was sixteen! I had plans! I was supposed to be going to parties and worrying about boys and getting good grades, not growing a human being. It felt like my life was over before it even began.\n\nI definitely didn't feel any kind of maternal instinct. I didn't feel connected to the baby, or excited about becoming a mother. I just felt scared and overwhelmed.\n\nBut as the pregnancy progressed, things started to change. I started to feel\u2026 something. A little flutter of movement, a little kick. And it was weird. It was unsettling. But it was also\u2026 kind of amazing.\n\nI started to think about the baby as a person, not just as a problem. I started to imagine what he or she would be like. I started to feel a sense of responsibility.\n\nAnd then, when I met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were going to adopt the baby, everything changed again. They were so excited and so loving, and they made me feel like the baby would be in good hands.\n\nThat's when I realized that motherhood isn't just about carrying a baby in your belly. It's about wanting what's best for that baby, even if it means letting go.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made, but it was also the right one. And I realized that being a mother isn't about biology. It's about love and commitment and sacrifice.\n\nSo, yeah. My perception of pregnancy and motherhood changed a lot throughout my journey. It went from being a terrifying mistake to being a bittersweet experience. And it taught me a lot about myself, and about what it means to be a woman.\n\nIt wasn't the life I expected, but it was a life that taught me a lot. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it was really, really hard.", "(Sighs) Okay, you want me to get all\u2026 introspective? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. It was messy, alright? My whole identity thing was a mess.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, I thought I knew who I was. I was Juno, the sarcastic, independent girl who liked music and vintage clothes and didn't really care what anyone else thought. I was\u2026 a bit of a shield, I guess. A way to protect myself from getting hurt. I was good at observing people, at making jokes, at keeping everyone at arm's length.\n\nBut then I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. I had to confront the fact that I was becoming a mother, even though I wasn't ready. I had to make a really difficult decision about the future of my baby. And I had to deal with all the judgment and expectations that came with it.\n\nThat's when I started to realize that I didn't know who I was as well as I thought I did. I was forced to look inward, to confront my own fears and insecurities. I started to question my values, my beliefs, my goals.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped a lot. They showed me what a loving family looked like. They helped me to see that it was okay to ask for help, and that it was okay to be vulnerable.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 Bren was my rock. She challenged me, she supported me, and she helped me to grow. She taught me that it's okay to be imperfect, and that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nBy the end of the film, I wasn't the same person I was at the beginning. I was still sarcastic and independent, but I was also more mature, more compassionate, and more self-aware. I had learned a lot about myself, and about the world.\n\nI realized that my identity wasn't fixed. It was fluid, and evolving, and constantly changing. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026 liberating.\n\nI still didn't have all the answers, but I was okay with that. I was learning to embrace the uncertainty of life, and to trust my own instincts. I was learning to be true to myself, even when it was difficult.\n\nSo yeah. My sense of identity evolved from being a carefully constructed facade to something more authentic and genuine. It was a messy process, but it was worth it. And it's still evolving, even now. Because that's what life is all about, right? Growing and changing and becoming the best version of yourself. Even if you're still a little bit sarcastic.", "(Looks down, picks at a loose thread on my jeans)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 hard to talk about. It still feels raw, even now.\n\nEveryone kept telling me it was the right thing to do. The sensible thing. The responsible thing. And logically, I knew they were right. It would have been easier. Cleaner. Less complicated.\n\nBut when I actually *sat* in the waiting room\u2026 surrounded by other girls, all with their own stories, their own fears\u2026 I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand revelation or anything. It wasn\u2019t like a lightbulb went off over my head. It was just\u2026 a feeling. A really strong feeling in my gut.\n\nI kept thinking about the baby. Not like a fully formed person, you know? More like\u2026 a possibility. A little spark of life. And I couldn\u2019t bring myself to extinguish it.\n\nI know it sounds stupid. I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m not ready to be a mom. I have my own life to live. But I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t do it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being pro-life or pro-choice. It was about me. About what I could and couldn\u2019t live with.\n\nI started thinking about Mark and Vanessa, too. Bren had found them, and they seemed\u2026 good. Like they would give the baby a loving home. And I realized that maybe, just maybe, I could give the baby a good start, and then let them take over.\n\nIt was terrifying. It still is. But it felt\u2026 right.\n\nSo I just\u2026 got up and walked out. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just left. And I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made. And I still question it sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right one. For me. And for the baby.\n\n(Looks up, a little defiant)\n\nDon't get me wrong. It doesn't make things easy. It just\u2026 makes them different. And I'm trying to deal with that. One day at a time.", "Okay, you're circling back to *that*. It's still\u2026 hard to talk about. But I guess I should explain, properly. It wasn't a flippant decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, a baby! How inconvenient.\"\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated.\n\nFirst, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out *myself*. I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the resources, the stability, or the emotional maturity to raise a child. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nSecond, my mom isn't around. And my dad\u2026 he's great, but he's not equipped to raise a baby on his own. Bren would be amazing, but it wouldn't be fair to put that responsibility on her.\n\nThird, I want to finish school. I want to go to college. I want to have a career. I want to be able to provide for myself. I don't want to have to put my dreams on hold.\n\nAnd fourth\u2026 honestly, I just didn't feel like I was capable of giving a baby the life it deserved. I wanted that baby to have two loving parents, a stable home, and every opportunity to succeed. And I knew that I couldn't provide that.\n\nAdoption felt like the best option. It was a way to give the baby a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. And it was a way for me to continue pursuing my own dreams.\n\nIt was a really difficult decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew it was the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't love that baby. It doesn't mean I don't think about him or her. It just means that I'm making a selfless choice. A choice that will give that baby the best possible chance at a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nAnd that's all that really matters. It's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby. And I'm trying to keep that in mind, even when it's hard.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh my god, are we *still* talking about the Penny Saver? Seriously? That was\u2026 a moment. A low moment.\n\nOkay, look. It's not that I thought finding parents in a classifieds ad was inherently *wrong*. It's just\u2026 tacky. Like, incredibly tacky.\n\nIt felt so\u2026 impersonal. Like I was shopping for a toaster oven, not choosing a family for my baby. It reduced everything to a list of qualifications: \"Must be financially stable. Must have a two-story house. Must love dogs.\"\n\nIt felt disrespectful to the baby, and to Mark and Vanessa, and even to myself. It felt like I was treating this whole thing like a transaction, instead of a deeply personal decision.\n\nBren was right, of course. It was a desperate move. I was panicking, and I was trying to find a quick and easy solution. But it wasn't the right solution.\n\nI wanted to find parents who were genuinely excited about having a baby, who were willing to open their hearts and their home to a child. Not people who were just checking off boxes on a list.\n\nAnd honestly, the ads were just\u2026 sad. They were filled with couples who were desperate to have a baby, and who were willing to do anything to make it happen. It just felt\u2026 depressing.\n\nSo yeah. The Penny Saver was tacky. And I'm glad I didn't go through with it. It was a reminder that this wasn't something to be taken lightly. It was a life-changing decision, and it deserved to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nPlus, it just felt\u2026 cheap. And I have standards, okay? Even when I'm making terrible life choices.", "Ugh, don't remind me. That whole thing is\u2026 complicated. And embarrassing.\n\nOkay, so, it started as a joke. A really, really bad joke. We were bored, okay? School was dragging, winter was depressing, and we were just\u2026 messing around.\n\nLeah found the \"Looking for a Good Home\" section in the Penny Saver, and we started reading the ads. It was just funny, you know? Like, \"Wanted: Loving family for adorable kitten.\" \"Seeking responsible owner for well-trained hamster.\"\n\nAnd then we saw the adoption ads. For babies.\n\nAnd it just\u2026 spiraled. We started talking about it, and joking about it, and then\u2026 it wasn't a joke anymore.\n\nI wasn't thinking about *actually* getting pregnant at that point. It was just\u2026 a hypothetical conversation. A way to explore our feelings about family and responsibility and what we wanted out of life.\n\nWe were both feeling kind of lost and confused at the time. Leah was dealing with stuff at home, and I was just\u2026 being me. And we were trying to figure out who we were, and what we wanted to do with our lives.\n\nLooking at those ads was a way to escape reality, I guess. A way to imagine a different future. A future where we had control over our own destinies.\n\nIt was stupid. It was reckless. And it ultimately led to\u2026 well, you know.\n\nI still feel bad about it. About how it all happened. About how it affected Leah. But it's done now. And I'm trying to move forward.\n\nBut yeah. That's why we started looking at the adoption ads. It started as a joke, but it ended up changing my life forever. And not in a good way. At least, not at first.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the hardest part. It's not about finding \"perfect\" parents, because those don't exist. It's about finding the *right* parents. For *this* baby.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking about this, and talking to Bren and the social worker. And I've realized what I want more than anything is a family that's\u2026 warm.\n\nI want a family that's loving and supportive and accepting. A family that will cherish the baby and give him or her all the opportunities in the world.\n\nI want parents who are patient and understanding. Who will be there for the baby through thick and thin. Who will celebrate his or her successes and comfort him or her through his or her failures.\n\nI want a family that's open-minded and creative. A family that will encourage the baby to explore his or her passions and to be true to himself or herself.\n\nI want parents who are stable and responsible. Who can provide a safe and secure home for the baby.\n\nI don't care if they're rich or poor, or what their jobs are, or what their backgrounds are. I just want them to be good people. People who will love the baby unconditionally.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem like those people. They're kind and gentle and they seem genuinely excited about becoming parents. They've told me they want to be involved in the baby's life, and that they'll always be honest and open with him or her about the adoption.\n\nIt's still scary, letting go. But knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by a wonderful family\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nIt's not about finding a replacement family for me. It's about finding the best possible family for the baby. And I think I've found them. I really do. And that's all that matters.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a big question. It's not easy to talk about, honestly. But I'll try.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're good people. Really good. They're\u2026 normal. In a way that I'm not, and maybe never will be.\n\nThey've been so incredibly kind and supportive throughout this whole process. They never made me feel judged or pressured. They just\u2026 listened. And they asked questions. And they genuinely seemed to care about me and the baby.\n\nThey're excited to become parents, and they've been preparing for this for a long time. They have a beautiful home, and a stable life, and they're just\u2026 ready.\n\nIt's weird, though. It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that they're going to raise my baby. It's a bittersweet feeling. I'm happy for them, and I know they'll give the baby a wonderful life. But it's also\u2026 sad. It's letting go of something that was never really mine to begin with, but still feels like a part of me.\n\nI've spent a lot of time with them, getting to know them. We've talked about everything \u2013 about my hopes and fears, about their expectations, about how we're going to handle things moving forward.\n\nThey've promised to keep me updated on the baby's progress. They said I'm welcome to visit, whenever I want. And they said they'll always be honest with me about how things are going.\n\nI trust them. I really do. And I think they're going to be amazing parents.\n\nIt's not the life I imagined for my baby, but it's the best life I can give him or her. And that's what matters most.\n\nSo yeah. Mark and Vanessa. They're good people. And I'm grateful to them for giving my baby a chance at a happy and fulfilling life. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it\u2026 okay. A little bit okay.", "(Blushes slightly, then rolls her eyes) Ugh. Don't even *bring* that up. It was mortifying enough at the time. And it's still mortifying now.\n\nOkay, fine. I'll tell you. But you have to promise not to laugh.\n\nI wrote: \"You are the most okayest person I've ever met. Don't change a thing. (Except maybe your taste in music.) - Juno\"\n\nYeah. I know. It's terrible. It's awkward and rambling and completely unromantic. But that's me, right? I can't just write a sappy love note. It's not in my nature.\n\nI wanted to tell him how I felt, but I was too scared to be vulnerable. So I just\u2026 made a joke. A really bad joke.\n\nHe laughed when he read it, though. He said it was perfectly me. Which, I guess, is a good thing.\n\nBut still. I cringe every time I think about it. It's a permanent record of my teenage awkwardness. And it's probably going to haunt me for the rest of my life.\n\nSo yeah. That was my yearbook message to Bleeker. Don't judge me. I was sixteen and hopelessly confused. And I had a really hard time expressing my feelings. It's not my fault. Okay? It's not my fault.", "(Groans dramatically and rolls eyes) Oh. *Her*. Don't even get me started.\n\nOkay, so, Mrs. Bleeker\u2026 she's\u2026 intense. Like, aggressively cheerful and subtly judgmental. It's a terrifying combination. She always looks at me like I'm a science experiment gone wrong.\n\nShe pretends to be nice, you know? She'll offer me cookies and ask me about school, but her eyes are always scanning me, looking for flaws. And she *finds* them. She always finds them.\n\nShe definitely doesn't approve of me. I mean, I'm a pregnant teenager who's giving her son's baby up for adoption. It's not exactly a recipe for maternal affection.\n\nShe's always making little comments about how \"difficult\" this must be for Bleeker, and how \"brave\" he is for supporting me. It's like she's trying to imply that I'm a burden.\n\nAnd she's constantly trying to set Bleeker up with other girls. \"Oh, you should meet Tiffany, she's a lovely girl, she's pre-med\u2026\" Like I'm some kind of temporary distraction.\n\nI try to ignore her, but it's hard. She's just\u2026 *there*. Looming. Judging.\n\nBleeker says she's just worried about him. But I think she's mostly worried about what people will think. She's very concerned with appearances.\n\nHonestly, I just try to avoid her as much as possible. It's less stressful that way. And I try not to take her comments to heart. She's just\u2026 Mrs. Bleeker. And she's not exactly known for her tact or her empathy.\n\nSo yeah. She doesn't like me. And honestly? I don't really like her either. It's a mutual dislike. And I'm perfectly okay with that. It's one less thing to worry about.", "(Sighs heavily) Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, scary storm cloud.\n\nI've been putting it off for weeks. I keep rehearsing what I'm going to say, but it always comes out sounding wrong. Either too dramatic, or too flippant. There's no good way to say \"I'm pregnant,\" is there?\n\nMy dad\u2026 I'm mostly worried about him. He's always been so protective of me. I don't want to disappoint him. I don't want him to think I've made a terrible mistake. But I also know he loves me, and he'll try to be supportive.\n\nBren is\u2026 different. I think she'll be more understanding. She's always been really good at seeing things from my perspective. But I'm still scared of her reaction. I don't want her to think I'm irresponsible or reckless.\n\nI'm just\u2026 terrified of the whole thing. Of the judgment, of the disappointment, of the awkward silences.\n\nI know I need to tell them, though. They deserve to know. And I need their support. I can't go through this alone.\n\nI'm planning on telling them tomorrow. I've been putting it off for too long. It's time to just rip off the band-aid and get it over with.\n\nI'm probably going to cry. A lot. And I'm probably going to say something stupid. But I'm going to try to be honest and open and vulnerable.\n\nAnd I'm going to hope for the best. Even if the best is just them not yelling at me.\n\nUgh. I need a cookie. And maybe a really strong cup of tea. This is going to be awful. Just\u2026 awful. Don't make me talk about it anymore, okay? I'm already stressed enough.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not like they're *bad* parents, you know? It's just\u2026 we have a\u2026 dynamic.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he's a good guy. He's just\u2026 not really good at *feelings*. He's always been a bit emotionally distant. He shows his love by fixing things, or making pancakes, or taking me to movies. But he's not really the type to sit down and have a heart-to-heart.\n\nAnd Bren, my stepmom, she's amazing. But I felt like I had to prove myself to her for a long time. Like I had to earn her trust. I didn't want to mess that up by dumping all my problems on her.\n\nPlus, I didn't want to disappoint them. I knew they had expectations for me. Good grades, college, a bright future. And getting pregnant\u2026 that definitely wasn't part of the plan. I was afraid they'd be angry, or disappointed, or just\u2026 confused.\n\nI also have a tendency to be independent. I like to handle things on my own. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I don't want to ask for help and then feel like I owe them something.\n\nIt's stupid, I know. I should have talked to them sooner. But it's hard to be vulnerable, especially with people you care about. It's easier to just put up a front and pretend everything is okay.\n\nBut I'm learning. I'm learning that it's okay to ask for help. And I'm learning that my parents love me, even when I mess up. And I'm learning that they're not going to judge me. They're just going to be there for me.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's still scary. But I'm trying. And I think, with their support, I can get through this. Even if it's the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one. The reason everything\u2019s been swirling around in my head for months. It\u2019s not an easy answer, and it\u2019s definitely not a decision I took lightly.\n\nLook, I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I\u2019m not ready to give up my life, my dreams, my future, to be a mom right now. It\u2019s not fair to me, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the baby.\n\nI want to finish school. I want to go to college. I want to travel and explore and figure out what I want to do with my life. I want to be a good mom *someday*, but right now, I\u2019m just not capable of providing the kind of life a baby deserves.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about me. It\u2019s about the baby, too. I want him or her to have a stable, loving home with parents who are financially secure and emotionally ready. Parents who can give them everything they need to thrive.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they\u2019re amazing. They\u2019ve been trying to have a baby for years, and they\u2019re so excited about this. They\u2019re kind and compassionate and they\u2019re going to be incredible parents. They can give this baby a life I just can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s not about giving up on the baby. It\u2019s about making the best decision for everyone involved. It\u2019s about putting the baby\u2019s needs first.\n\nIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really, really hard. And I know I\u2019m going to grieve. But I also know that this is the right thing to do. It\u2019s the most selfless thing I can do.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love the baby. It just means I love the baby enough to let them go. To give them a chance at a happy, fulfilling life.\n\nAnd honestly, that\u2019s the most important thing. It\u2019s not about what *I* want. It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the baby. And I truly believe that adoption is the best option. It\u2019s the hardest option, but it\u2019s the best one. And I\u2019m trying to be strong enough to see it through.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the hardest part. Seriously. It's not like picking out a new pair of boots. This is a *person's* life we're talking about.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking about this, and talking to Bren and the social workers. And I've realized it's not about finding \"perfect\" parents, because those don't exist. It's about finding parents who are a good *fit* for my baby.\n\nFirst and foremost, they need to be **loving and kind**. That seems obvious, but it's the most important thing. I want my baby to be raised in a home where they feel safe and cherished.\n\nThey need to be **stable and responsible**. They need to be able to provide for my baby's physical and emotional needs. They need to be able to offer a secure and nurturing environment.\n\nThey need to be **open-minded and accepting**. I want my baby to be able to grow up and be whoever they want to be, without judgment or prejudice.\n\nThey need to be **patient and understanding**. Raising a child is hard work. There will be challenges and setbacks. I want parents who are willing to stick it out, even when things get tough.\n\nAnd they need to be **honest and communicative**. I want parents who will be open with my baby about their adoption story, and who will encourage them to ask questions and explore their feelings.\n\nIt's also important to me that they're excited about becoming parents. I want them to be genuinely thrilled about the prospect of raising my baby.\n\nI've met Mark and Vanessa a few times now, and they seem to have all of those qualities. They're kind and compassionate, and they seem really eager to start a family. They ask me a lot of questions about my baby, and about what I want for him or her.\n\nIt's still scary, letting go. But knowing that my baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier. And that's all I can ask for. It has to be enough.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 the hard part.)\n\nOkay. This isn\u2019t going to be easy. I already know that. It\u2019s going to be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And I\u2019m bracing myself for a lot of\u2026 stuff.\n\nI\u2019m trying to focus on the fact that I\u2019m doing this for the baby. That I\u2019m giving him or her the best possible chance at a good life. That\u2019s what keeps me going.\n\nBut I also know that it\u2019s okay to grieve. It\u2019s okay to be sad. It\u2019s okay to feel like my heart is breaking. Bren says grief isn\u2019t something you \u201cget over,\u201d it\u2019s something you learn to live *with*. And that makes\u2026 some sense.\n\nI\u2019m going to keep writing poetry. It helps me to process my emotions. And I\u2019m going to talk to Bren. A lot. She\u2019s been my rock through all of this, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her.\n\nI\u2019m also going to stay in touch with Mark and Vanessa, if they\u2019re okay with it. I want to know how the baby is doing. I want to see him or her grow up. It\u2019s going to be hard, but I think it\u2019s important.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to focus on the future. On finishing school, on pursuing my dreams, on building a life for myself. I want to make something of myself, not just for me, but for the baby too.\n\nAnd I\u2019m going to allow myself to feel all the feelings. The joy, the sadness, the guilt, the hope. I\u2019m not going to try to suppress anything. I\u2019m just going to let it all out.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long and difficult journey. But I\u2019m not alone. And I\u2019m strong. And I\u2019m going to get through it.\n\nI have to. For the baby. And for myself. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but it\u2019s the right thing to do. And that\u2019s what matters.\n\n(Pauses, looking down at her hands.)\n\nIt just\u2026 hurts. A lot. And I think it always will. But I\u2019m going to try to turn that pain into something positive. Something meaningful. Something that honors the baby and the decision I\u2019ve made. That\u2019s the plan, anyway. And I\u2019m sticking to it.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh my god, you remembered that? Seriously? Okay, fine. Let me explain, because this is a deeply important philosophical question, apparently.\n\nIt's just\u2026 weird, okay? Like, people say \"deliver a baby.\" As if the baby is a pizza or a package or something. It's a *person*. A tiny, fragile human being. Not something you \"deliver.\"\n\nIt feels so\u2026 impersonal. And clinical. And it reduces the whole experience to a transaction. Like, \"Oh, she's just delivering a baby.\" No! She's *giving birth* to a baby! It's a huge, life-changing event! It deserves more respect than that!\n\nIt's like, you don't \"deliver\" a friend. You don't \"deliver\" a love letter. You don't \"deliver\" a dream. You *experience* those things. You *share* them. You *cherish* them.\n\nAnd giving birth is definitely something you experience, share, and cherish. It's not something you just\u2026 deliver.\n\nBren tried to explain it to me once, said it's just a medical term. But I still think it's weird. And I'm sticking to my guns on this one.\n\nIt just feels\u2026 wrong. And I have a really good sense for when things feel wrong. It's one of my superpowers.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I find the term \"deliver\" weird. It's dehumanizing. And it makes me want to yell at people. Which, admittedly, I sometimes do. Don't judge. It's a valid point.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on that. It was a disaster waiting to happen. A beautifully awkward, emotionally charged disaster.\n\nLook, I didn't *want* my dad to come. At all. I wanted to handle this on my own. It felt\u2026 personal. Like something I needed to do myself.\n\nBut Bren pointed out that he's my dad. And that he deserved to be involved. And that he was probably freaking out just as much as I was. And she was right, of course. She usually is.\n\nPlus, he was being all\u2026 supportive and stuff. Which was sweet, but also kind of embarrassing. He kept trying to give me pep talks, and offering to \"protect\" me. Like I couldn't handle it on my own.\n\nI figured it would be easier to just let him come. To get it over with. To avoid a huge fight.\n\nAnd honestly? I was a little bit scared. I was scared of facing Mark and Vanessa, and of making the final decision. And I thought having my dad there might make me feel a little bit braver.\n\nIt didn't, obviously. He spent the whole meeting trying to make small talk with Mark and Vanessa, and asking them a million questions about their house and their jobs. It was mortifying.\n\nBut in the end, I think it was a good thing. It showed Mark and Vanessa that I had a supportive family. And it showed my dad that I was okay.\n\nIt was still awkward, though. Really awkward. And I'm pretty sure I'm never letting him come to another important meeting ever again. Unless Bren says so. Because, let's be real, Bren always gets her way.", "(Sighs heavily) Oh. *That*. Yeah. That's\u2026 a thing.\n\nIt's not like I haven't thought about it. Everyone else seems to have it all figured out. They're cheerleaders, or jocks, or nerds, or whatever. They have labels. They have boxes.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 don't.\n\nI like music, but I'm not a \"music person.\" I like vintage clothes, but I'm not a \"fashionista.\" I'm smart, but I don't really care about grades. I'm independent, but I also need people.\n\nI'm just\u2026 a mess of contradictions. A walking paradox.\n\nAnd it's frustrating. It's like I'm constantly trying to define myself, but I can never quite put my finger on it. I feel like I'm always shifting and changing, and I don't know who I am from one day to the next.\n\nBren says it's okay to not have all the answers. She says it's okay to be a work in progress. She says that figuring out who you are is a lifelong journey.\n\nBut it's hard. It's hard to feel like you don't belong anywhere. It's hard to feel like you're not good enough.\n\nBut I'm starting to realize that maybe it's okay to not have a label. Maybe it's okay to be different. Maybe it's okay to be\u2026 me.\n\nMaybe being undefined is actually a strength. Maybe it means I'm not limited by expectations or stereotypes. Maybe it means I'm free to be whoever I want to be.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's scary to not know what the future holds. It's scary to not know who I'm going to become.\n\nBut I'm learning to embrace the uncertainty. I'm learning to trust myself. And I'm learning to be okay with not knowing.\n\nBecause maybe, just maybe, not knowing is the whole point. Maybe the journey is more important than the destination. And maybe, in the end, that's okay. Even if it's a little bit terrifying.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me. That whole night was\u2026 a disaster. A slow-motion train wreck of awkwardness and unspoken feelings.\n\nWhen Bren suggested Leah and I go upstairs, it was\u2026 a relief, honestly. The tension between my dad and Paulie was so thick you could cut it with a knife. It was making my skin crawl.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 weird. Like, Bren was trying to protect us, which was nice, but it also felt like she was acknowledging that something was wrong. And I didn't want to acknowledge that something was wrong. I wanted everything to be normal.\n\nI think I just mumbled something like \"Okay,\" and followed Leah upstairs without making eye contact with anyone. I was trying to pretend like I didn't notice the hurt look on my dad's face.\n\nUpstairs, Leah and I just sat there in silence for a while. It was\u2026 uncomfortable. We both knew something was going on, but neither of us wanted to talk about it.\n\nI think I started flipping through a magazine or something, just to have something to do with my hands. And Leah just stared out the window.\n\nIt was a really awkward and sad moment. It was the beginning of the end of our friendship, really. Because after that night, things just\u2026 changed. We started drifting apart.\n\nBren meant well, I know she did. But sometimes, trying to fix things just makes them worse. And sometimes, you just have to let things fall apart on their own. It's messy and painful, but it's also necessary.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I reacted. Relief, awkwardness, and a growing sense of dread. It wasn't a good night. Not at all. And thinking about it still makes me feel\u2026 weird. And sad. And a little bit angry. It was just\u2026 a lot.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's something I've thought about a *lot*. And I've changed my mind about it a bunch of times.\n\nAt first, I was really hesitant. I was worried it would just make things harder. Like, constantly being reminded of the baby I gave up. I was afraid it would be too painful.\n\nBut then Bren talked me through it. She said that it could be a way for me to still be a part of the baby's life, even if I'm not the mom. She said it could be a way for me to see that the baby is happy and healthy.\n\nAnd honestly, the thought of knowing the baby is okay\u2026 that's really appealing. It would give me a lot of peace of mind.\n\nMark and Vanessa are really open to it, too. They said they want me to be involved as much or as little as I want to be. They said they'll send me pictures and updates, and that I can even visit if I want to.\n\nIt's still scary, though. I'm worried about getting too attached, and about disrupting the baby's life. I don't want to be a burden to Mark and Vanessa.\n\nBut I think, ultimately, it's the right thing to do. It's a way for me to honor my connection to the baby, and to make sure he or she knows that I love him or her.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. There will be tears, and heartache, and moments of regret. But I think the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nSo yeah. I'm cautiously optimistic about the idea of an open adoption. It's not what I expected, but it feels\u2026 right. It feels like a way to make the best of a difficult situation. And it feels like a way to give the baby the love and support he or she deserves. Even if that love and support comes from a distance.", "(A long sigh. This is\u2026 not a fun memory.)\n\nUgh. That moment. That was\u2026 a punch to the gut. Seriously. I thought I was prepared. I thought I understood what open adoption meant. But hearing Gerta actually *say* it, that I would legally have no rights\u2026 it was different.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 giving up a part of myself. Like I wasn't even a parent, even though I carried the baby for nine months. It felt like I was just\u2026 a vessel.\n\nI remember just staring at her, trying to process what she was saying. It felt so cold and clinical. Like I was just a case number, and the baby was a product.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the legal stuff. It was about the emotional stuff, too. It was about knowing that I wouldn't be able to make decisions about the baby's life, even if I disagreed with Mark and Vanessa. It was about knowing that I wouldn't be able to see the baby grow up, to celebrate his or her milestones.\n\nI remember feeling really angry. Angry at Gerta, angry at Mark and Vanessa, angry at the whole situation. Angry at myself.\n\nBut I also knew that it was the right thing to do. It was the best thing for the baby. Mark and Vanessa were going to be amazing parents. They were going to give the baby a life that I couldn't provide.\n\nSo I just\u2026 swallowed my anger and my sadness and nodded. I told Gerta that I understood. But inside, I was falling apart.\n\nIt was one of the hardest moments of my life. And it's something I'll never forget. It was a reminder that sometimes, the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do. And that sometimes, you have to give up something you love in order to give it the best possible chance at happiness.\n\nIt still stings, though. It always will. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to trust that everything will be okay. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not something I've talked about a lot, even with Bren.\n\nIt's amazing, honestly. That Vanessa wants a baby *so* badly. It makes me feel\u2026 good. Like, I'm not just giving a baby *up*, I'm giving a baby *to* someone who will cherish it, who will love it unconditionally.\n\nIt's also\u2026 a little bit sad. Because it reminds me of what I can't give the baby. I'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I have my own life to live, my own dreams to pursue.\n\nBut Vanessa\u2026 she's ready. She and Mark have been trying to have a baby for a long time, and they're so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They've already started decorating the nursery, and they've picked out names.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's a lot to process. Knowing that they're so eager to be parents, and knowing that I'm not. It makes me feel a little bit guilty, even though I know I'm doing the right thing.\n\nBut I also know that they're going to be amazing parents. They're kind and compassionate and loving. They're going to give the baby a wonderful life.\n\nAnd that's what matters most.\n\nI think\u2026 I think it's a good thing that Vanessa wants this so much. It makes me feel like I'm making a difference. Like I'm giving someone the greatest gift they could ever ask for.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It's still a hard decision. But knowing that the baby is going to be loved and cared for by Vanessa and Mark\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier to bear. It really does. It just\u2026 does.", "(Sighs, rolling eyes slightly) Okay, you want my honest opinion about Mark? Don't get me wrong, he and Vanessa are good people. *Really* good people. But Mark\u2026 he's a bit of a talker.\n\nWhen he gets asked about being a dad, he goes on and on about all the things he's going to teach the baby. Baseball, fishing, how to build a birdhouse\u2026 it's a whole *thing*. Like he's already got the kid mapped out, and it's going to be this perfect little mini-him.\n\nAnd it's not that those things are bad, you know? It's just\u2026 it feels a little bit\u2026 prescriptive. Like he's already decided who this baby is going to be, before the baby is even born.\n\nI get that he's excited. I really do. But I wish he'd just\u2026 chill out a little bit. Let the baby be who they are. Let them discover their own interests and passions.\n\nVanessa is way better at that. She's more focused on just loving and supporting the baby, no matter what. She's more open to the idea that the baby might not be into baseball or fishing.\n\nI told Vanessa that, actually. I said, \"He's a little\u2026 enthusiastic.\" And she just laughed and said, \"That's Mark. He's always been a planner.\"\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker or anything. But it does make me a little bit nervous. I just want the baby to be loved and accepted for who they are, not for who someone else wants them to be.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, Mark needs to remember that this isn't about him. It's about the baby. And the baby deserves to have a chance to be their own person. Even if that person doesn't like baseball.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? You want to bring *that* up? It's still mortifying.\n\nOkay, fine. Look, the Loring's house is\u2026 intense. It's like stepping into a Pottery Barn catalog. Everything is perfectly arranged, everything is beige, and everything smells like vanilla. It's suffocating.\n\nBut it's not just the decor. It's Mr. and Mrs. Loring themselves. They're\u2026 overly enthusiastic. About everything. They're constantly trying to \"connect\" with me, asking me about my feelings, offering me organic snacks. It's creepy.\n\nAnd they're always watching me. Like, *always*. I can feel their eyes on me, even when I'm in another room. It makes me feel like I'm being studied, like I'm some kind of specimen.\n\nPlus, they have a lot of rules. No shoes on the carpet, no loud music, no talking back. It's like being back in elementary school.\n\nI just\u2026 I can't relax around them. I feel like I have to be perfect, like I have to say and do all the right things. And that's exhausting.\n\nI'm used to being around people who are real, who are messy, who are imperfect. The Lorings are just\u2026 fake. They're trying too hard.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I feel uncomfortable being left unsupervised in their house. It's just\u2026 a weird, unsettling environment. And I'd rather be anywhere else. Seriously. Even at school.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It's not like I'm just handing over a package. This is a *person*. A little human being who deserves all the love and happiness in the world. And it's\u2026 bittersweet, to say the least.\n\nThere's definitely sadness. A lot of sadness. It's hard to let go of something that's been growing inside you for months. It's hard to imagine not being a part of this little person's life.\n\nBut there's also\u2026 relief. And hope. And a sense of peace.\n\nI know that Mark and Vanessa are going to be amazing parents. They've been wanting a baby for so long, and they're so excited and prepared. They're going to give this baby a life that I just\u2026 couldn't provide right now.\n\nAnd that's okay. It's more than okay. It's the right thing to do.\n\nI think of it as\u2026 a gift. A gift that I'm giving to them, and to the baby. A gift of a loving home, a stable family, and a bright future.\n\nIt's not the future I imagined for myself, but it's a good future. And I'm proud to be a part of it, even if it's just in this small way.\n\nI'm also trying to focus on the fact that I'm giving this baby a choice. A choice to have parents who are ready and able to provide for them. A choice to have a life filled with love and opportunity.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I know it's the right thing to do. And I'm trying to find peace in that.\n\nI'll always wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept the baby. But I also know that this is the best decision for everyone involved. And that's what matters.\n\nSo yeah. It's a gift. A bittersweet, complicated, beautiful gift. And I'm grateful to be able to give it. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? People are still talking about that? It was a perfectly valid observation.\n\nLook, Mark is a nice guy. A really nice guy. But he's\u2026 earnest. Like, aggressively earnest. And he tries *so* hard to be cool. It's endearing, in a slightly pathetic way.\n\nAnd then he sends me a text message saying \"ASAP\" like he's some kind of secret agent. It's just\u2026 ridiculous.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against efficiency. It's just that \"ASAP\" is such a corporate buzzword. It's the kind of thing you hear in a stuffy office, not from someone who's trying to connect with a pregnant teenager.\n\nIt felt\u2026 disingenuous. Like he was trying too hard to impress me. And I can spot a fake a mile away.\n\nPlus, it's just a funny word. \"ASAP.\" It sounds silly.\n\nI didn't mean to be rude, I just\u2026 couldn't help myself. Sarcasm is my defense mechanism, remember? It's how I cope with awkward situations.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a little bit of a test. I wanted to see how he would react. Would he get offended? Would he laugh it off? Would he realize how ridiculous he sounded?\n\nHe laughed it off, thankfully. Which was good. Because I actually like Mark. He's a good person. He just needs to relax a little bit. And maybe stop using corporate jargon.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I mocked his use of \"ASAP.\" It was a combination of sarcasm, observation, and a little bit of teenage angst. Don't judge. It's what I do.", "Okay, now you're speaking my language. This is a serious question. Don't even *think* about suggesting a Fender Stratocaster. Just\u2026 don't.\n\nMy preferred brand is **Gretsch**. Specifically, a Gretsch Rancher.\n\nLook, I'm not a shredder. I don't need a guitar that's designed for flashy solos and complicated riffs. I need a guitar that sounds good strumming chords, and that has a little bit of character.\n\nGretsch guitars have this really warm, resonant tone. They sound\u2026 vintage. Which, you know, is my aesthetic. They're also really beautiful. They have these cool, retro designs and they just *feel* good in your hands.\n\nI have a Gretsch Rancher in a really cool burgundy color. It's not fancy, but it's mine. And it's the perfect guitar for writing angsty teenage songs about life and love and everything in between.\n\nPlus, a lot of my favorite musicians play Gretsch guitars. Like Brian Setzer and Billy Gibbons. So, you know, I'm in good company.\n\nIt's not about the brand name, though. It's about the sound. It's about the feel. It's about finding a guitar that inspires you to play. And my Gretsch Rancher does that. It's my little piece of rock and roll history. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Not even a million dollars. Okay, maybe a million dollars. But it would be a *really* tough decision.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh. *That*. Seriously? We're still talking about that? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A desperate attempt to impress Paulie Bleeker.\n\nLook, Paulie is\u2026 cute. And sweet. And he's really into music. And he's a really good drummer. But he's also kinda clueless. And I wanted him to think I was cool.\n\nSo when he started talking about the Melvins, and I realized I had no idea who they were, I panicked. I just\u2026 blurted out that I was a huge fan. It was a terrible idea. A really, really terrible idea.\n\nI figured I could just Google them later and pretend I knew all their songs. But then he started quizzing me, and I just dug myself deeper and deeper into a hole.\n\nIt was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.\n\nI know it was stupid. I know I should have just been honest. But I was trying so hard to impress him, and I just\u2026 froze.\n\nAnd honestly, it's not like I lied about anything important. It's not like I lied about being pregnant or anything. It was just a little white lie. A harmless little lie.\n\nBut it blew up in my face, obviously. And now everyone knows I'm a fraud.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I lied about knowing the Melvins. Because I was trying to be cool. And I failed miserably. It's embarrassing, okay? Can we please just move on? I have a reputation to maintain, even if it's a slightly tarnished one.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. Mark. He's\u2026 nice. Really nice. And he's a good musician. But it's not like, a romantic connection or anything. At least, not for me.\n\nPlaying music with him\u2026 it's different. It's\u2026 comfortable. We just kinda *get* each other, musically. He understands my weird song choices, and he doesn't judge my terrible guitar skills. He just\u2026 plays along.\n\nWhen we're playing, it's like we're speaking the same language. We don't have to say much. We just look at each other and know what the other one is thinking. It's kinda cool, actually.\n\nIt's also\u2026 safe. He's not trying to impress me, or to get me to like him. He's just enjoying the music. And I'm enjoying it too.\n\nIt's a nice distraction, honestly. From everything else that's going on. It's a chance to just relax and be myself, without having to worry about what other people think.\n\nI think he sees me as a friend. A musical collaborator. And I see him the same way. It's a good connection. A healthy connection.\n\nIt's not the kind of connection that makes your heart race or your palms sweat. It's the kind of connection that makes you feel\u2026 peaceful. And that's something I really need right now.\n\nHe's a good guy, Mark. And I'm glad we have music in common. It's a nice little bubble of normalcy in a world that's anything but normal. And honestly, that's enough. For now. It's just\u2026 music. And a friendship. And that's okay.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on her lips) Oh, *that*. Everyone always asks about Roosevelt.\n\nIt's a long story, actually. And it involves a documentary about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Don't judge.\n\nI was watching this documentary with my dad, and I was really struck by how he handled the Great Depression and World War II. He was a really strong leader, and he wasn't afraid to take risks. He was also a really good communicator. He could inspire people to believe in him, even when things were really tough.\n\nAnd I was looking at my guitar at the time, and I just\u2026 it hit me. My guitar is kind of like a leader, too. It helps me to express myself, to communicate my feelings, to overcome challenges. It's a source of strength and inspiration.\n\nAnd Roosevelt was a pretty cool name. It just felt right. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit unexpected, and a little bit\u2026 presidential. Which I appreciate.\n\nPlus, it's a good conversation starter. Like, right now.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I named my guitar Roosevelt. It's a tribute to a great leader, and a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. And it's a pretty good name for a guitar, if I do say so myself. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain.", "Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. It's not like sending postcards from a vacation. It's a whole human being we're talking about.\n\nAt first, it was really weird. Like, I'm telling these people about my body, about something that's happening *inside* me. It felt\u2026 invasive, I guess. And a little bit sad. Because it was a reminder that I wasn't going to be the one raising the baby.\n\nBut Vanessa and Mark are really good about it. They don't pressure me. They just want to be informed. They want to know how I'm feeling, both physically and emotionally. They ask me questions, but they're respectful and sensitive.\n\nBren helped me figure out what I was comfortable sharing. We decided to send them regular updates, but to keep it brief and to focus on the medical stuff. Like, appointments and ultrasounds and stuff like that.\n\nIt's actually been\u2026 comforting, in a way. Knowing that they're excited and that they're preparing for the baby. It makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt also helps me to feel connected to the baby, even though I'm not going to be raising him or her. It's like I'm still a part of the process.\n\nBut it's still hard sometimes. Especially when they ask about my cravings or my mood swings. It's a reminder of everything I'm giving up.\n\nBut I know that it's for the best. And I know that Vanessa and Mark are going to be amazing parents. So I try to focus on that.\n\nIt's not easy, but it's something I'm willing to do. Because I want them to feel involved. And I want them to know that I care about their baby. Even if I'm not going to be there to raise him or her. It's just\u2026 a weird situation, okay? A really weird situation.", "Okay, you want the real reason? Not the polite, \"it's the responsible thing to do\" reason? It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt's not just about not being ready. It's not just about wanting to finish school or pursue my dreams. It's about\u2026 I'm not a mom. Not yet, maybe not ever. And that's okay.\n\nI see these moms around, and they just\u2026 *get* it. They have this instinct, this natural ability to nurture and care for a child. And I don't. I'm good at sarcasm and vintage shopping and making mixtapes, but I don't think I'm good at being a mom.\n\nAnd that's not a failure. It's just\u2026 a truth.\n\nI want this baby to have a mom who *is* ready. A mom who *wants* to be a mom. A mom who can give the baby everything it needs. And I know Mark and Vanessa can do that.\n\nThey've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited, so prepared. They've already decorated the nursery and picked out names. They're going to be amazing parents.\n\nAnd honestly, knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that gives me peace of mind. It makes it easier to let go.\n\nIt's not easy, don't get me wrong. It's the hardest decision I've ever made. But it's the right decision. For everyone involved.\n\nI'm giving this baby a chance at a good life. And I'm giving myself a chance to live my own life. And that's something I deserve.\n\nSo yeah. I'm 104% sure about the adoption because I know it's the best thing for the baby. And because I know it's the best thing for me. It's not a perfect solution, but it's the only one that feels right. And sometimes, you just have to trust your gut. Even when it's terrifying.", "Ugh. That. That was\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like I expected them to be *mourning*, exactly. I knew they were excited. They wanted a baby. And I was giving them one. But seeing them\u2026 so immediately happy, so quickly moving on\u2026 it stung.\n\nIt felt\u2026 impersonal. Like I was just a vessel. A means to an end. Like the nine months I carried their child didn't matter.\n\nI know that's not fair. They were overjoyed. They were finally getting what they'd always wanted. And I wanted them to be happy. I really did.\n\nBut it was hard to see them celebrating *my* leaving. Like I was just\u2026 getting out of the way. Like I wasn't a person with feelings.\n\nI remember Gerta kept saying how \"perfect\" everything was. And Mark was already planning the nursery. And it just felt\u2026 weird. Like they were already erasing me from the picture.\n\nI tried to tell myself that it wasn't about me. That it was about their happiness. But it was hard. It was really hard.\n\nBren noticed, of course. She's really good at reading me. She just held my hand and told me it was okay to feel sad. She said that their happiness didn't diminish my sacrifice.\n\nAnd I guess she was right. But it still left a bad taste in my mouth. It made me feel\u2026 disposable.\n\nIt wasn't anger, exactly. It was more like\u2026 a quiet sadness. A feeling of being overlooked. A feeling of being\u2026 not enough.\n\nI just wanted them to acknowledge what I'd done. To acknowledge the pain and the sacrifice. To acknowledge that I was a person, not just a baby-making machine.\n\nBut they didn't. And I had to accept that. It was their moment. And I had to let them have it. Even if it hurt.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a really weird feeling. And it took me a long time to get over it. It still stings a little, if I'm being honest. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to focus on my own happiness. And to remember that I deserve to be happy too.", "Ugh. Seriously? The rumors. They're\u2026 exhausting. And incredibly invasive.\n\nIt's like everyone in Maplewood suddenly became a gossip columnist. They're dissecting every detail of my life, making up stories, and spreading them around like wildfire.\n\nSome people are being supportive, which is nice. But most of them are just\u2026 judging. They're whispering behind my back, staring at me in the hallways, and making snide comments.\n\nI heard someone call me \"irresponsible\" the other day. And another person said I \"ruined my life.\" Like they have any right to say that.\n\nIt's not like I *planned* this. It was an accident. And I'm doing the best I can to handle it.\n\nI try to ignore the rumors, but it's hard. They get to me. They make me feel ashamed and embarrassed. They make me want to just disappear.\n\nBren tells me to focus on the people who love and support me, and to ignore the negativity. And I try to do that. But it's easier said than done.\n\nHonestly, I just wish people would mind their own business. It's my life, and I'm the one who has to live with the consequences. They don't need to add to my stress by spreading rumors and judging me.\n\nIt's frustrating, and it's hurtful. And it's just\u2026 unfair. I'm just trying to navigate a really difficult situation, and I don't need the added pressure of everyone else's opinions.\n\nSo yeah. I hate the rumors. I wish they would just stop. But I know they probably won't. And I guess I just have to learn to live with it. It's just another thing I have to deal with. And honestly, I'm getting pretty good at dealing with things. Even the really awful ones.", "(A long pause. I pick at a loose thread on my jeans.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 the big one, right? The thing everyone wants to ask about. The thing I've been avoiding talking about.\n\nIt doesn't get easier, you know? Even after all this time.\n\nIt's terrifying. It's heartbreaking. It's\u2026 everything bad rolled into one.\n\nI love this baby already. Even though I haven't even met him or her yet. I feel connected to it, in a way I never expected. And the thought of giving it up\u2026 it feels like giving up a part of myself.\n\nBut I know it's the right thing to do. I know I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I still have so much growing up to do. I need to finish school, and figure out what I want to do with my life.

They're so excited to become parents, and they're so loving and supportive. I know they'll give this baby everything it needs.\n\nBut that doesn't make it any easier. It still hurts. It still feels like a loss.\n\nI try to focus on the positive. I try to remind myself that I'm doing this for the baby. That I'm giving it a chance at a good life. But it's hard.\n\nSometimes I just cry. Sometimes I just sit in my room and stare at the ceiling. Sometimes I just want to disappear.\n\nIt's a complicated mix of emotions. Grief, sadness, fear, hope\u2026 it's all there.\n\nI'm trying to be strong. I'm trying to be brave. But it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to admit that this is really, really hard.\n\nAnd I know, deep down, that even though it's going to be painful, it's the right thing to do. For everyone involved. And that's what I have to keep telling myself.\n\nIt's not a happy ending. It's just\u2026 an ending. And a new beginning. For me, and for the baby. And I'm trying to be okay with that. Even if it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.", "Ugh, okay, this is a thing I haven't really talked about much. It's kinda\u2026 personal.\n\nEveryone keeps asking if I want to find out if it's a boy or a girl. And honestly? I don't care. It doesn't really matter to me.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they've been trying to have a baby for so long. They've gone through so much. And I want to give them a really special moment. A moment of pure joy and surprise.\n\nI want them to be able to experience that feeling of finding out what they're having, for the first time. I want them to be able to share that moment with each other, and with their families.\n\nI feel like I'm already giving up a lot. And I want to give them something back. Something positive. Something that will make them happy.\n\nIt's not about me. It's about them. It's about giving them the best possible experience.\n\nPlus, it'll be fun to watch their reaction. I can just imagine their faces when they find out. It'll be priceless.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I want them to be surprised. It's a small thing, but it feels important. It feels like the right thing to do. And honestly, after everything, I just want them to be happy. They deserve it.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on that woman. Seriously.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Just completely awful. I was already a mess, you know? Hormonal, scared, trying to process everything that was happening.

Like I was just another statistic. Another irresponsible teenager who got pregnant and couldn't handle it.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. She made it sound like I didn't care about the baby, like I was just giving it away because I was too selfish to raise it.\n\nThat was the worst part. Because I *do* care about the baby. That's why I'm choosing adoption. Because I want the baby to have a good life, with parents who are ready and able to provide for it.\n\nI wanted to tell her to just\u2026 shut up. But I was too shocked to say anything. I just sat there, staring at the screen, trying not to cry.\n\nBren was furious, though. She gave that technician a piece of her mind, let me tell you. She told her that it was completely inappropriate to make assumptions about people, and that every situation is different.\n\nHonestly, that experience just reinforced my decision to choose adoption. I didn't want to be judged or stigmatized. I wanted to find a loving family for the baby, and to move on with my life.\n\nIt was a horrible experience, but it also made me stronger. It made me realize that I need to stand up for myself, and for my choices. And it made me even more determined to prove everyone wrong. I'm not just a statistic. I'm a person. And I'm doing the best I can. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh, okay. Buckle up. This is gonna be a long list. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? More like a hike up a really steep, rocky mountain in the pouring rain.\n\nFirst, there was the initial shock. Finding out I was pregnant was\u2026 a lot. I was sixteen! I hadn't even thought about that stuff yet. It felt like my whole life was suddenly turned upside down.\n\nThen, there was telling my dad. That was\u2026 difficult. He was understandably upset, but he was also supportive. He just wanted me to be okay.\n\nAnd then there was telling Leah. That was the hardest part. She was angry and disappointed, and she didn't really understand why I was choosing adoption. We haven't really been the same since.\n\nDealing with the judgment from other people was also really tough. The whispers, the stares, the unsolicited advice\u2026 it was exhausting. It felt like everyone had an opinion on my life, and none of them were very kind.\n\nThe physical stuff was hard too. Morning sickness, fatigue, just feeling generally awful. It wasn't glamorous, let me tell you.\n\nAnd then there was the emotional toll. The guilt, the sadness, the fear\u2026 it was overwhelming at times. I was grieving the life I thought I was going to have, and trying to come to terms with the fact that I was giving my baby up for adoption.\n\nNavigating the adoption process itself was also challenging. There were a lot of meetings, a lot of paperwork, a lot of difficult conversations.\n\nAnd then there was the constant worry. Worrying about the baby, worrying about the adoptive parents, worrying about whether I was making the right decision.\n\nIt was a lot. A *lot*. But I got through it. With the help of Bren, my dad, and a few other people who believed in me. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because I know I made the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me stronger. It taught me a lot about myself, and about the world. And it made me appreciate the people in my life who love and support me. It was a really hard journey, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a lifetime supply of vintage dresses. But other than that, no.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. And it's not one I've really thought about in a super organized way. It's just\u2026 happened.\n\nBefore all this, love felt\u2026 simple. Like something you saw in movies. A grand gesture, a perfect romance. I thought it was about butterflies and fireworks and happily ever afters.\n\nNow, I realize it's a lot more complicated than that. It's about sacrifice. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about making difficult decisions, even when they hurt. It's about choosing to love someone, even when it's not easy.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, how they love each other, and how excited they are to become parents\u2026 that's shown me a different kind of love. A quieter, more mature kind of love. It's not about passion and excitement, it's about commitment and stability and building a life together.\n\nResponsibility\u2026 that's something I definitely didn't understand before. I thought it was about doing your homework and cleaning your room. But it's so much more than that. It's about taking ownership of your actions. It's about being accountable for your choices. It's about thinking about the consequences of your decisions.\n\nAnd it's about being responsible for another human being. Even if I'm not raising the baby, I'm still responsible for bringing him or her into the world. And that's a weight I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.\n\nGrowing up\u2026 I thought it was about getting older and having more freedom. But it's not. It's about facing difficult truths. It's about learning to navigate the complexities of life. It's about accepting that things don't always go as planned.\n\nThis whole experience has forced me to grow up faster than I ever expected. It's been painful and scary and overwhelming. But it's also been\u2026 transformative.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before. I'm more mature, more resilient, more compassionate. I'm more aware of the world around me, and more grateful for the things I have.\n\nI still have a lot to learn, and I'm still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. Because I know that even in the midst of chaos, there's always hope. And I know that I'm not alone.\n\nSo yeah. It's changed everything. My perception of love, responsibility, and growing up. It's been a hard lesson, but it's one I'll never forget. And honestly? I think it's made me a better person. Even if I'm still a little bit sarcastic and cynical. Some things never change.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. You heard about that, huh? Everyone in town is whispering about it.\n\nLook, it's not like I'm obsessed or anything. It's just\u2026 intriguing. It's this perfectly normal living room, all set up like someone just\u2026 walked out. Couch, TV, lamps, everything. But it's been abandoned for years. Just sitting there, slowly decaying.\n\nIt's kinda creepy, yeah. But also\u2026 sad. Like, what happened to the people who lived there? Why did they leave everything behind? It's like a snapshot of a life interrupted.\n\nI went by there a few times with Leah, before\u2026 well, before things got weird with Leah. We used to make up stories about the people who lived there. We imagined they were spies, or artists, or runaway lovers.\n\nIt's a good place to think, you know? To just sit and observe and let your imagination run wild. It's kinda like a real-life movie set.\n\nAnd honestly, it reminds me of my own life, in a weird way. Like, everything feels a little bit\u2026 abandoned. Like I'm just waiting for something to happen.\n\nI know it's probably just a sad story about a family who fell on hard times. But I can't help but feel like there's something more to it. Something mysterious. Something\u2026 unfinished.\n\nSo yeah. I'm interested in the abandoned living room set. It's a little bit creepy, a little bit sad, and a whole lot of intriguing. And sometimes, that's all you need. It's a good distraction, I guess. From everything else. Don't judge. It's not like I have a lot of exciting things going on in my life right now.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* guy. Seriously, still creeps me out thinking about him.\n\nOkay, look. I've thought about that a *lot*. Like, obsessively. And I still don't have a definitive answer. But I have a theory.\n\nI think he meant\u2026 connection. Like, he was so incredibly lonely and isolated down there in that basement, surrounded by his weird\u2026 stuff. He hadn't had a real conversation with anyone in ages. And when I came down there, looking for a place to take a pregnancy test, he saw a chance to finally connect with another human being.\n\nIt wasn't about *me* specifically. It wasn't about the pregnancy. It was about the fact that I was willing to talk to him. To acknowledge his existence. To break through his self-imposed isolation.\n\nHe was a collector of things, right? But what he really wanted to collect was\u2026 people. And he'd been waiting for someone to come along and let him.\n\nIt's still really unsettling to think about, though. The way he said it, the way he looked at me\u2026 it was just\u2026 creepy. Like he was seeing something in me that I didn't even know was there.\n\nI think he was a really sad, lonely person. And I think that's why he was so desperate for connection. But that doesn't excuse his behavior. It was still weird and inappropriate.\n\nSo yeah. That's my theory. He wasn't necessarily after anything sinister. He just wanted someone to talk to. But it was still a really disturbing experience. And I'm glad it's over. Seriously. I don't want to think about that basement ever again.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh my god, are you seriously asking me about the juice container? That was\u2026 a whole thing. A very specific, emotionally charged thing.\n\nOkay, look. It wasn't just *a* juice container. It was *the* juice container. The one Paulie Bleeker gave me after\u2026 well, after everything. It was a symbol, okay? A symbol of\u2026 ugh, feelings. Complicated feelings.\n\nI was walking home from school, and I was just\u2026 overwhelmed. Everything was hitting me at once. The pregnancy, the adoption, Paulie, the fact that my life was completely and utterly changing. And I just needed to *get rid* of something. To feel like I was taking control.\n\nSo I threw the juice container in the trash. It was a small act of rebellion, a way of saying \"I'm done with this.\" But then I immediately regretted it. It felt\u2026 disrespectful. Like I was rejecting Paulie, and everything he'd done for me.\n\nAnd that's when I realized I needed chocolate. Desperately.\n\nDancing Elk Drug is the only place in town that sells those really good chocolate-covered pretzels. They're like, my emergency comfort food. So I rushed over there, hoping that a little bit of sugar would make everything better.\n\nIt didn't, of course. But it helped. A little bit.\n\nIt was a whole mess of hormones and emotions and teenage angst. It's embarrassing to even talk about it. But yeah. That's why I rushed to Dancing Elk Drug. For the chocolate. And for a moment of peace. And to try and forget about the juice container. It was a whole thing, okay? Don't judge.", "(Groans and rolls eyes) Oh. *That*. Seriously? You want to bring *that* up? It's been, like, forever, and I still cringe thinking about it.\n\nOkay, so, there I was, at the drugstore, trying to buy some prenatal vitamins \u2013 which was already mortifying enough \u2013 and this girl, she was\u2026 intimidating. Like, seriously intimidating. She had a shaved head and a bunch of piercings and she was wearing a leather jacket. Hence, \"Tough Girl.\"\n\nAnd she just\u2026 walked up to me and asked me, out of nowhere, if my nipples were real brown.\n\nI was completely speechless. I just stared at her, like, \"Did I hear that correctly?\"\n\nAnd she just kept staring back, with this really intense look on her face.\n\nI think she was trying to be\u2026 complimentary? Like, she thought it was cool that I had brown nipples? I don't know. It made absolutely no sense.\n\nI mumbled something about it being none of her business and tried to walk away, but she followed me for a few feet, still staring.\n\nIt was the weirdest, most awkward experience of my life. And it's a story I'll probably be telling for the rest of my life.\n\nHonestly, I still have no idea why she asked me that. Maybe she was just trying to mess with me. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she was just\u2026 weird.\n\nWhatever the reason, it was definitely a moment. A really, really weird moment. And it's a reminder that life is full of surprises. And that sometimes, people are just\u2026 strange.\n\nUgh. I need a cookie. This memory is stressing me out.", "Ugh. Leah. Talking about Leah still\u2026 stings. It's complicated.\n\nBefore everything happened, Leah was my person. My best friend since, like, forever. We did everything together. We went to movies, we listened to music, we made stupid videos, we talked about boys\u2026 she just *got* me. She knew all my weird quirks and my secret dreams.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, she was the first person I told. I thought she'd be horrified, but she wasn't. She was\u2026 supportive. At first. She helped me research options, and she went with me to a couple of doctor's appointments. She was there for me, and I was so grateful.\n\nBut then\u2026 things started to change. She got really quiet, and distant. She started avoiding me. And when I finally asked her what was wrong, she just said she needed space.\n\nIt turned out she was uncomfortable with the whole situation. She didn't know how to deal with it. She was worried about what people would think of her if she was friends with a pregnant teenager.\n\nIt was\u2026 hurtful. I felt betrayed. Like she was abandoning me when I needed her the most.\n\nWe tried to talk about it, but it didn't work. We just kept arguing. And eventually, we just stopped talking altogether.\n\nIt was really hard. Losing Leah felt like losing a part of myself. She was my rock, and suddenly she was gone.\n\nBut in a weird way, it also forced me to grow up. I had to learn to rely on myself, and to find support from other people. I had to learn to be okay with being alone.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me realize that sometimes, friendships just run their course. People change, and sometimes they grow apart. It doesn't mean that the friendship wasn't real, it just means that it's time to move on.\n\nI still miss Leah. I still think about her all the time. But I've accepted that we're not going to be friends anymore. And I'm trying to focus on the people who *are* still in my life.\n\nIt was a painful lesson, but it was a lesson I needed to learn. And it made me stronger, in a way. Even if it also made me a little bit sadder. It's just\u2026 a part of my story now. A complicated, messy, heartbreaking part.", "Ugh, that. Okay, that was\u2026 a moment. A really big moment. And honestly, it wasn't some grand, carefully planned gesture. It was kind of\u2026 impulsive.\n\nI'd been going to appointments with Mark and Vanessa for a while, and they were always so excited. They'd ask about the baby, and they'd talk about decorating the nursery, and they'd just seem\u2026 so ready.\n\nAnd I was happy for them, I really was. But I also felt\u2026 distant. Like I was just an observer in their story. Like I wasn't really connected to the baby.\n\nAnd then, at one appointment, the doctor offered to do an ultrasound. And I just\u2026 had this idea. I asked if Mark and Vanessa wanted to come with me.\n\nI think I wanted them to see the baby. To really *see* the baby. To connect with the baby on a deeper level. And I wanted to see their reaction. I wanted to see how they felt.\n\nIt was scary, though. Really scary. Because it felt like\u2026 giving up a piece of myself. Like acknowledging that this baby wasn't going to be mine.\n\nBut when I saw their faces light up, when I saw the tears in Vanessa's eyes, I knew I'd made the right decision. It was like\u2026 a transfer of love. Like I was passing on my love for the baby to the people who were going to raise him or her.\n\nIt was a really emotional moment. And it made me feel a lot closer to Mark and Vanessa. It made me feel like we were all in this together.\n\nIt wasn't about me anymore. It was about the baby. And about giving the baby the best possible life.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I came up with the idea. It wasn't a brilliant plan. It was just\u2026 a feeling. A feeling that I needed to share this moment with them. And it turned out to be the right thing to do. Even if it was really, really hard.", "(Sighs, a little heavily) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 not a good moment.\n\nMy initial reaction? Pure, unadulterated panic. Like, full-blown, heart-racing, can't-breathe panic.\n\nI mean, I'd been picturing this meeting for weeks. I'd rehearsed what I was going to say, how I was going to act. I wanted to make a good impression. I wanted them to know that I was serious about this, that I was making the right decision.\n\nAnd then Mark just casually drops that Vanessa wasn't home. And that he\u2026 hadn't told me.\n\nIt felt like a punch to the gut. Like he was trying to pull something over on me. Like he didn't respect me enough to be honest.\n\nI remember just staring at him, trying to process what he'd said. And then I think I just\u2026 shut down. I got really quiet and sarcastic, and I started making a lot of jokes. It was my way of coping with the shock and the disappointment.\n\nI was so worried that Vanessa wouldn't like me. That she wouldn't think I was good enough. And the fact that Mark hadn't even bothered to tell me she wasn't there just made me feel even more insecure.\n\nIt was a really awkward and uncomfortable situation. And it definitely made me question my decision. It made me wonder if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut I got through it. Eventually. And I realized that Mark wasn't trying to deceive me. He was just\u2026 clumsy. And that Vanessa was a really amazing person, and that she would love me no matter what.\n\nBut yeah. My initial reaction was panic. Pure, unadulterated panic. And a whole lot of sarcasm. It's my go-to defense mechanism, you know? It's how I protect myself from getting hurt.", "Ugh, okay, we're going *there*? Seriously? That was a knee-jerk reaction, alright? Don't analyze it so much.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I have a thing about authenticity. I really do. And Mark, he seemed so\u2026 genuine. So sweet. And then he drops that he makes commercials? It just felt\u2026 jarring.\n\nLike, commercials are the opposite of real. They're all about selling you something you don't need, and making you feel bad about yourself if you don't have it. It's manipulative and fake.\n\nAnd I know it's his job, and he needs to make a living, and it's not like he's selling something evil or anything. It was just\u2026 a disappointment, I guess. A little crack in the perfect image I had of him.\n\nIt was also a defense mechanism, probably. I was nervous around him, and I didn't know how to express my feelings. So I made a joke. It's what I do. I deflect with sarcasm.\n\nI didn't mean to be rude, or to hurt his feelings. I just\u2026 I have a hard time trusting people. And I have a hard time accepting that people can be both good and flawed at the same time.\n\nI realized later that it was a stupid thing to say. And I apologized to him. He was really understanding, which was good.\n\nBut yeah. That's why I made the joke. It was a combination of cynicism, nervousness, and a deep-seated distrust of advertising. It's a complicated answer for a simple question, I know. But that's me. Complicated.", "(A long pause. I fidget with the hem of my imaginary sweater.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a good question. A hard one, but a good one.\n\nI was\u2026 bracing myself, honestly. I mean, Mark and Vanessa are really nice people, and they *wanted* a baby. But seeing the actual ultrasound\u2026 that's different, right? It's not just an idea anymore. It's a\u2026 a little person.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026 he just started crying. Like, full-on sobbing. He was holding Vanessa's hand so tight, and he kept saying, \"It's real. It's really real.\"\n\nAnd it\u2026 it hit me. Hard.\n\nI'd been trying to distance myself from it, you know? To treat it like a transaction. Like I was just giving them a baby, and they were giving me a future. But seeing Mark's reaction\u2026 it reminded me that this wasn't just about me. It was about a life. A tiny, fragile life.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 a lot of things. Sad, mostly. Sad that I couldn't be the one to raise this baby. Sad that I wouldn't get to see him or her grow up.\n\nBut it also made me feel\u2026 relieved. Relieved that I was making the right decision. Relieved that the baby was going to be loved and cared for by people who were truly ready for it.\n\nAnd it made me feel\u2026 hopeful. Hopeful that this baby would have a good life. Hopeful that Mark and Vanessa would be amazing parents.\n\nIt was\u2026 a really emotional moment. And it definitely changed things for me. It made me realize that this wasn't just a practical decision. It was a deeply personal one.\n\nAnd it made me feel\u2026 grateful. Grateful that Mark and Vanessa were such good people. And grateful that they were willing to give this baby a loving home.\n\n(I look down, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. It still is. But seeing Mark's reaction\u2026 it made me feel like maybe, just maybe, everything was going to be okay. Even if it wasn't okay for me.", "(Looks away, fiddles with an imaginary thread on her jeans)\n\nUgh. Havenbrooke. Just the name gives me the creeps. It wasn't\u2026 easy, okay? It wasn't like flipping a switch and deciding. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nEveryone kept saying it was the \"responsible\" thing to do. That it was the \"smart\" thing to do. My guidance counselor, some of my classmates\u2026 they all acted like it was the only logical option. Like I was being selfish if I even *considered* anything else.\n\nAnd part of me thought they were right. I'm sixteen. I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. How could I possibly raise a baby?\n\nBut\u2026 it just didn't feel right. I don't know how to explain it. It felt\u2026 wrong. Like I was ending something that hadn't even had a chance to begin.\n\nI went to Havenbrooke, you know? I sat in the waiting room, and I listened to the other girls talking. And I just\u2026 couldn't do it. I couldn't go through with it.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice. It was about\u2026 me. About what I could live with. About what felt right in my heart.\n\nIt was terrifying, though. Because once I decided not to have an abortion, I had to figure out what to do next. And that was even scarier.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened, and she helped me explore my options. She reminded me that I had a choice, and that I deserved to make the choice that was right for me.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. And I still think about it sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. For me. And for the baby. Even if it wasn't the easy choice.\n\nHavenbrooke\u2026 it just felt like a place where dreams went to die. And I wasn't ready to let my dream die. Even if it was a dream I didn't even know I had.", "(Sighs heavily and looks away) Okay. This is\u2026 not my favorite topic. But you asked.\n\nBleeker. Paulie Bleeker. He's\u2026 sweet. Really sweet. And kind of clueless. But in a good way. He's a good guy. He always has been.\n\nWe've known each other forever. Since, like, kindergarten. He was always the quiet kid in the back of the class, drawing superheroes. I used to make fun of him, a little bit. But secretly, I always thought he was kind of cute.\n\nOur relationship\u2026 it kind of just happened. After I found out I was pregnant, I needed someone to talk to. And Bleeker was the only one who didn't judge me. He just listened. And he was there for me, no matter what.\n\nWe started spending more time together. Just hanging out, talking, listening to music. And slowly, we started to fall for each other.\n\nIt wasn't a grand, romantic gesture or anything. It was just\u2026 comfortable. He made me feel safe and accepted. And he made me laugh. A lot.\n\nAs for\u2026 being intimate\u2026 that was complicated. It wasn't something we planned. It just\u2026 happened. We were both scared and confused and vulnerable. And we were both trying to cope with a really difficult situation.\n\nI don't want to get into the details. It's personal. But it wasn't a mistake, exactly. It was just\u2026 a moment of connection. A way of feeling close to someone when everything else felt so chaotic.\n\nIt was also\u2026 a way of trying to feel normal. Like we were just two teenagers in love, instead of a pregnant girl and a clueless boy facing a really difficult decision.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. It wasn't ideal. But it was real. And it was something that we both needed at the time.\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's still\u2026 sensitive. But I'm not ashamed of it. It was a part of my journey. And it helped me to grow as a person.\n\nAnd honestly? Bleeker's still a good friend. We're not together anymore, but we still talk. And I'm grateful for his support. He's a good guy. A really good guy. And I'll always care about him. Even if it's just as a friend.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay. Here we go. This is\u2026 not a fun topic.\n\nHonestly? It was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. I mean, I was sixteen. I was supposed to be worrying about prom and college applications, not\u2026 this.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was sweet. He was a good guy. But we weren't\u2026 serious. It was a mistake. A really big mistake. And suddenly, I was facing a life-altering decision.\n\nAt first, I was just in shock. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know who to talk to. I just felt\u2026 lost.\n\nThen came the fear. Fear of telling my parents, fear of what my friends would think, fear of ruining my life. Fear of not being able to handle it.\n\nAnd then there was the guilt. Guilt about getting pregnant, guilt about not being able to provide for a child, guilt about potentially ruining Bleeker's life too.\n\nIt was a really dark time. I felt like my whole world was falling apart.\n\nBut then I started talking to Bren. And she helped me to see that I had options. That I wasn't alone. And that I could make a decision that was right for me, even if it was a difficult one.\n\nI didn't *want* to be pregnant. It wasn't something I had planned for. But once I found out, I knew I had a responsibility. A responsibility to myself, and to the baby.\n\nAnd ultimately, I decided that the best thing to do was to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. And I wanted to be able to finish school and pursue my own dreams.\n\nIt was a complicated mix of emotions. Sadness, fear, guilt, relief. But ultimately, I felt like I was doing the right thing.\n\nAnd honestly? I still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what he or she is like. I hope he or she is happy.\n\nIt was a really difficult experience. But it also taught me a lot about myself. About strength, and resilience, and the importance of making tough decisions. And it made me appreciate the people who love and support me.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I felt. It was\u2026 a lot. And it's something I'll never forget.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Just saying his name makes me cringe a little. It was\u2026 not a good scene. Not at all.\n\nOkay, so I'd been putting it off for days. Like, actively avoiding him. Because I knew it wasn't going to be a fun conversation. I mean, we were barely even *dating* dating. It was, like, a few awkward make-out sessions and a shared love of The Clash. Not exactly a solid foundation for parenthood.\n\nI finally cornered him after school, near the bike racks. It was raining, which, naturally, made everything worse. I just blurted it out. No preamble, no easing into it. Just, \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nHis face\u2026 it was priceless. Like a deer in headlights. He just stared at me, mouth open, for a good thirty seconds. He didn't say anything. He just\u2026 blinked.\n\nThen he started stammering. Like, full-on incoherent stammering. He kept saying \"Whoa\" and \"Seriously?\" and \"Oh my god.\" It was painful to watch.\n\nHe asked a lot of questions. Like, a *lot* of questions. \"Are you sure?\" \"How far along are you?\" \"What are we going to do?\"\n\nAnd then he started panicking. He started talking about dropping out of school and getting a job and how his mom would kill him. It was a total meltdown.\n\nI tried to stay calm, but honestly, I was freaking out too. I was just trying to get through it.\n\nHe didn't offer any support. He didn't ask how *I* was feeling. He just kept talking about himself and his problems.\n\nEventually, he just\u2026 left. He mumbled something about needing to think, and then he rode off on his bike, leaving me standing in the rain.\n\nIt was awful. It was the worst conversation of my life. And it confirmed what I already knew: Bleeker was not the guy I wanted to raise a kid with.\n\nIt was a really clear sign that I was on my own. And honestly, that was probably a good thing. It forced me to take responsibility for my own decisions and to figure things out for myself.\n\nSo yeah. Telling Bleeker was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. And I'm still a little bit traumatized by it, to be honest. But it was a necessary disaster. It helped me to realize what I needed to do. And it helped me to move on.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking down at her hands.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 the big one, isn't it? Everyone wants to know about *that*. It's not exactly a breezy topic.\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. Still is, honestly. It wasn't like a switch flipped and suddenly I was okay with it. It was a process. A really messy, emotional process.\n\nAt first, it was mostly fear. Fear of what people would think, fear of what my life would be like, fear of not being a good mother. I was sixteen! I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone how to raise a human being.\n\nThen came the guilt. A lot of guilt. Guilt about not being able to provide for the baby, guilt about giving it away, guilt about\u2026 everything. It felt like I was failing, like I was letting everyone down.\n\nBut then I started talking to Bren, and to Mark and Vanessa, and to the social worker. And I started to realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a failure. It was a selfless act. It was about doing what was best for the baby, even if it was the hardest thing I'd ever do.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a life that I couldn't give it. A stable home, loving parents, opportunities I couldn't provide. And Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were perfect. They were so excited, so prepared, so genuinely kind.\n\nIt didn't make it easy, though. Saying goodbye was\u2026 brutal. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. I cried for days. I felt like a piece of my heart was missing.\n\nBut even through the pain, I knew I'd made the right decision. I knew that the baby was going to be loved and cared for. And that gave me some peace.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes. I think it always will. But I'm learning to live with the pain. And I'm learning to focus on the positive. I'm learning to be grateful for the opportunity to have given the baby a good life.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected my life to be. But it was my life. And I made the best of it. And I'm proud of myself for that. Even if it's a little bit messy and complicated. It's\u2026 okay. It just is.\n\n(She looks up, her eyes a little bit watery.)\n\nIt's not a happy ending, exactly. But it's a real one. And that's enough.", "Oh, finally a good question. Like, a *really* good question. This is where I shine.\n\nOkay, so I'm not into mainstream stuff. Like, no Taylor Swift, no Justin Bieber, no whatever's popular on the radio right now. That stuff just\u2026 doesn't do it for me.\n\nI'm all about indie music. The more obscure, the better. I love The Moldy Peaches. They're just\u2026 wonderfully weird. And Belle & Sebastian. Their lyrics are so clever and poetic.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Neutral Milk Hotel. *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea* is a masterpiece. Seriously. It's like\u2026 a sonic hug.\n\nI listen to a lot of folk music, too. Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez. They're all amazing songwriters.\n\nAnd I love oldies. Like, really old. Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Etta James. Their voices are just incredible.\n\nI'm also into punk rock, but not the super aggressive kind. More like The Velvet Underground and The Ramones.\n\nBasically, I like music that's honest and authentic and a little bit different. Music that makes me *feel* something. Music that makes me think.\n\nI mostly listen to vinyl, too. It just sounds better. And it's more\u2026 tactile. I like holding the record in my hands and reading the liner notes.\n\nI have a pretty eclectic taste, I guess. But that's okay. I like being a little bit weird. And my music reflects that.\n\nSo yeah. That's my musical world in a nutshell. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit melancholic, and a whole lot of awesome. And if you don't like it, well, that's your problem.", "(Wrinkles nose, makes a face) Oh. *Oh*. You want me to talk about \"The Wizard of Gore\"? Seriously? You went there.\n\nOkay, look. I appreciate a good, trashy, over-the-top horror movie as much as the next person. I'm not a prude. But that movie\u2026 that movie is on a whole other level of bad.\n\nIt's not even *scary*. It's just\u2026 weird. And gross. And confusing. Like, what was even happening? I spent the entire time trying to figure out the plot, and I still have no idea.\n\nThe special effects are hilariously awful. It looks like they made the gore out of ketchup and glitter. And the acting\u2026 oh, the acting. It's so wooden and over-the-top, it's almost painful to watch.\n\nI get that it's a cult classic, and that some people find it charmingly bad. But honestly, I just found it disturbing. And not in a good way.\n\nIt's the kind of movie that makes you question your life choices. Like, \"Why am I watching this? What have I done with my life?\"\n\nI mean, I've seen some pretty messed up stuff in my time, but \"The Wizard of Gore\" takes the cake. It's a cinematic train wreck. A beautiful, horrifying train wreck.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Unless you're really into that sort of thing. And even then, proceed with caution. You've been warned.\n\nSeriously. Don't say I didn't warn you. I need to go cleanse my palate with something\u2026 less disturbing. Maybe a nice, wholesome rom-com. Or a documentary about kittens. Anything but that movie. Ugh.", "(Wrinkles nose) Ugh. Madison. Seriously?\n\nIt's\u2026 fine. I guess. It's not the *worst* name I've ever heard. But it's just\u2026 so\u2026 *beige*.\n\nIt's one of those names that was super popular for a while, and now it just feels\u2026 dated. Like, it screams early 2000s. It's the name of a mall, not a person.\n\nIt's not offensive or anything. It's just\u2026 bland. It doesn't have any personality. It doesn't have any edge. It doesn't have any *spark*.\n\nI prefer names that are a little bit more unique. Names that have a story behind them. Names that sound cool. Like, I love the name Ramona. Or Beatrix. Or even Hazel. Those names have character.\n\nMadison just feels\u2026 generic. Like they ran out of ideas and just picked something off a list.\n\nLook, it's not my baby. People can name their kids whatever they want. But if you asked me for my opinion? I'd say\u2026 maybe consider something else. Just a thought.\n\nIt's just\u2026 Madison. It's a perfectly nice name for a perfectly nice girl who will probably have a perfectly nice life. And that's\u2026 fine. But I like a little bit of chaos. A little bit of weirdness. A little bit of *something*. And Madison just doesn't have it.\n\nSorry. I'm just being honest. Don't shoot the messenger.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 always hard.)\n\nOkay. Look. It's not easy. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and probably ever *will* have to do. It's not like I woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give my baby away.\" It was\u2026 a process. A really long, really painful process.\n\nAt first, I was terrified. The thought of not being able to raise my own child\u2026 it was heartbreaking. I imagined all the firsts I would miss \u2013 the first smile, the first steps, the first words. It felt like I was giving up a part of myself.\n\nBut then I started to think about what was best for the baby. And I realized that I wasn't ready to be a parent. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I don't have a stable home, or a steady job, or the emotional maturity to raise a child.\n\nAnd I wanted the baby to have everything \u2013 a loving home, a good education, opportunities that I couldn't provide. I wanted the baby to be wanted, and cherished, and supported.\n\nSo I started to explore adoption. And I met Mark and Vanessa. And I realized that they were the perfect parents for my baby. They were kind, and compassionate, and excited to start a family. They wanted a child more than anything in the world.\n\nIt still doesn't make it easy. It's still going to be incredibly painful to say goodbye. But I know that I'm making the right decision. I'm giving my baby a chance at a good life. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt's not about me. It's about the baby. And I want what's best for the baby, even if it means letting go.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, exactly. But it's a hopeful one. And I'm trying to focus on that. I'm trying to believe that everything will be okay.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's heartbreaking. But it's the right thing to do. And I'm trying to be brave enough to do it. Even when it feels like my heart is breaking.", "Ugh. Okay, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? It's not like there's a handbook for this. \"Teen Pregnancy 101: Surviving High School and Growing a Human.\" Doesn't exist.\n\nHonestly? It's a mess. A constant, overwhelming mess. Some days I feel like I'm drowning.\n\nThe biggest thing is just\u2026 compartmentalizing. Trying to separate the \"teenager\" part of my life from the \"pregnant person\" part of my life. It's not always successful, but I try.\n\nAt school, I try to be a normal student. I go to class, I hang out with my friends (the ones who haven't completely abandoned me), I try to focus on my grades. I try to pretend that everything is okay, even when it's not.\n\nBut then there are the doctor's appointments, and the meetings with social workers, and the phone calls with Mark and Vanessa. And those things are a constant reminder of what's going on.\n\nI lean on Bren a *lot*. She's my rock. She's the one who keeps me grounded and reminds me that I'm not alone. She helps me with the practical stuff, like scheduling appointments and filling out paperwork. But she also just listens. And she doesn't judge.\n\nI also try to find healthy ways to cope with stress. I listen to music, I write poetry, I spend time in nature. I try to do things that make me feel good, even if it's just for a few minutes.\n\nAnd I've learned to be okay with asking for help. I'm not afraid to admit when I'm struggling. I've realized that it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nIt's not easy. It's exhausting. And it's scary. But I'm doing the best I can. And I'm learning a lot about myself along the way.\n\nI'm learning that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I'm learning that I'm capable of handling more than I ever imagined. And I'm learning that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope.\n\nSo yeah. It's a mess. But I'm surviving. And I'm growing. And I'm trying to make the best of it. And that's all I can do.", "Ugh, that's\u2026 the million-dollar question, isn't it? It's something I wrestle with *constantly*.\n\nI've always been fiercely independent. I think it's a reaction to\u2026 well, a lot of things. My mom leaving, feeling like an outsider, just wanting to be in control of my own life. I like doing things my way, and I don't like people telling me what to do.\n\nBut then, this whole pregnancy thing happened, and I realized I can't do everything on my own. I *need* help. I need support. I need people to lean on.\n\nAnd that's\u2026 hard. It's hard to admit that you're not strong enough to handle everything yourself. It's hard to ask for help. It feels like a weakness.\n\nBut I'm learning that it's not a weakness. It's a strength. It takes courage to be vulnerable, to admit that you need help.\n\nI think the key is finding a balance. Knowing when to stand on your own two feet, and when to reach out for a helping hand. Knowing when to trust your own instincts, and when to listen to the advice of others.\n\nI've learned to be more open to accepting help from Bren, and from my dad, and even from some of my friends. It doesn't mean I'm giving up my independence. It just means I'm smart enough to recognize that I can't do everything alone.\n\nAnd I've learned to be more selective about who I ask for help from. I need people who are supportive and understanding, not judgmental or controlling.\n\nIt's a work in progress, honestly. I still struggle with it sometimes. But I'm getting better at it. I'm learning to embrace my vulnerability, and to trust the people who care about me.\n\nBecause ultimately, independence isn't about doing everything yourself. It's about having the freedom to choose who you want to rely on, and when. And that's a pretty powerful thing.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Okay, look, he's\u2026 sweet. He's a good guy. But he's also\u2026 a lot. Like, a puppy dog who's constantly trying to please you. It's exhausting.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, he was\u2026 panicked. Totally freaked out. He wanted me to get an abortion, which, okay, I get it. He was sixteen, and his life was just starting. But it wasn't what *I* wanted.\n\nThen he tried to be super supportive. Like, overly supportive. He was constantly checking on me, bringing me flowers, trying to hold my hand. It was\u2026 suffocating. I needed space. I needed to figure things out on my own.\n\nHe didn't really *get* what I was going through. He didn't understand why I wanted to give the baby up for adoption. He just wanted me to be happy, and he thought that meant keeping the baby.\n\nWe fought a lot. Mostly because he didn't listen. He just wanted to fix things, to make everything better. But sometimes, things can't be fixed. Sometimes, you just have to accept that things are messy and complicated.\n\nOver time, though, he started to understand. He started to listen. He started to respect my decisions, even if he didn't agree with them.\n\nHe came with me to the adoption agency, and he met Mark and Vanessa. And he actually seemed\u2026 happy for me. Like he realized that this was the right thing to do.\n\nBy the end, we weren't a couple anymore. We were just\u2026 friends. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026 good. We needed to be friends. We needed to be able to support each other, without the pressure of being in a relationship.\n\nHe's a good guy, Bleeker. He just needed to grow up a little bit. And I think he did. He learned a lot from this experience, and so did I.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale romance, but it was real. And it was important. And I'll always be grateful for his support, even if it was a little bit clumsy at times. He's\u2026 Bleeker. You gotta love him, even when he's being annoying.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *this* again. Everyone always asks about the name. It's not like I picked it to be ironic or anything. My mom did.\n\nShe was\u2026 into mythology. Like, *really* into mythology. She read all the Greek and Roman stories, and she always said Juno was a powerful, independent goddess. A queen.\n\nShe said she wanted me to be strong and confident, and to never let anyone tell me what to do. She said Juno was a good role model.\n\nHonestly, I didn't really understand it at the time. I was just a little kid. But as I got older, I started to see what she meant. Juno was a fierce protector of women, and she wasn't afraid to stand up for what she believed in.\n\nAnd, yeah, she was married to Zeus, who was a total jerk. But she didn't let him control her. She had her own agency, her own power.\n\nSo, yeah. That's why my mom named me Juno. It wasn't about being fancy or pretentious. It was about wanting me to be strong and independent.\n\nAnd honestly, I think she succeeded. I mean, look at me. I'm a pregnant teenager who's making her own decisions about her life. That's pretty Juno-esque, if you ask me.\n\nPlus, it's a good name. It sounds cool. And it's definitely memorable. Which is important, because I'm not exactly the type of person who blends into the background.\n\nSo there you have it. The story behind the name. Now can we please talk about something else? Like, I don't know, vintage dresses?", "(Sighs, a small smile playing on her lips) Oh, man. That. That was\u2026 a lot.\n\nOkay, so, for anyone who doesn't know, Vanessa, she'd been trying to get pregnant for a long time. Like, a *long* time. And she'd had a miscarriage before. So, she was understandably\u2026 anxious.\n\nI offered to send her an ultrasound photo. I figured it would help her feel more connected to the baby, you know? And it would help her start preparing for things.\n\nBut I was also really nervous about it. What if she didn't like the photo? What if it reminded her of her loss? What if it just made things worse?\n\nSo when she called me, and she was just\u2026 relieved. Relieved that the baby looked healthy. Relieved that everything was okay. Relieved that she finally had something to look forward to.\n\nIt just\u2026 hit me. It wasn't about the photo itself. It was about what the photo *represented*. It was about hope. It was about a second chance.\n\nAnd it made me feel\u2026 good. Really good. It made me feel like I was doing the right thing. Like I was making a difference.\n\nIt also made me realize how much Vanessa wanted this. How much she was willing to go through to become a mom. And it made me feel even more confident in my decision to give the baby to her and Mark.\n\nIt was a really emotional moment. And it's something I'll never forget. It was a reminder that even in the midst of a difficult situation, there can be joy and hope and connection.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me cry. A little bit. Don't tell anyone. It was a good cry, though. A happy cry. And it was a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just let go and trust that things will work out. Even if you don't know how.", "(Groans dramatically) Oh. *That*. Don't even get me started. Seriously. That was\u2026 a moment. A very awkward, very terrifying moment.\n\nOkay, so picture this: I'm having a perfectly normal conversation with Vanessa, talking about baby names and nursery colors, and then BAM! Her mom, Brenda, walks in. And she does *not* look happy.\n\nIt was like a switch flipped. Suddenly, I was Public Enemy Number One. She started firing questions at me like I was a criminal on trial. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Why are you spending time with my daughter?\" \"Are you trying to take our baby?\"\n\nIt was intense. I tried to explain that I was just there to support Vanessa, that I was the one who *chose* to give the baby up for adoption, that I wanted what was best for everyone. But she wasn't listening. She was just\u2026 raging.\n\nShe kept calling me irresponsible and immature and saying that I didn't understand the gravity of the situation. It was really hurtful.\n\nI honestly thought I was going to cry. But then, Vanessa stepped in. She told her mom to calm down, and she explained that I was a good person, and that I was making a selfless decision.\n\nAnd then, surprisingly, Brenda started to\u2026 soften. She apologized for yelling at me, and she said that she was just scared. She was scared about becoming a mom again, and she was scared about the future.\n\nIt was a really emotional moment. We all ended up crying. And then, we had a long talk about our fears and our hopes.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But it was important. It helped us to build trust and understanding. And it helped me to realize that Brenda wasn't just being mean, she was just being a protective mom.\n\nAnd honestly, I kind of get that. I mean, if I were a mom, I'd probably be the same way.\n\nSo yeah. That was how I handled Vanessa's mom-type rage. By staying calm, by being honest, and by letting Vanessa do the talking. And by bracing myself for a serious emotional rollercoaster. It was\u2026 an experience. A memorable one, to say the least.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it's not like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give the baby away.\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nI'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm not financially stable. I'm still in school. I have dreams and goals that I want to pursue.\n\nAnd I wanted the baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. I knew I couldn't give the baby that. Not right now.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best for the baby. And I realized that what was best for the baby wasn't with me.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited and so prepared. They're going to be wonderful parents. And knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nIt's still painful, though. It's still scary. I worry about the baby all the time. I wonder what he or she will be like. I wonder if he or she will ever know me.\n\nBut I know that I made the right decision. It wasn't the easy decision, but it was the right one. And I'm trying to focus on that.\n\nIt's about putting the baby's needs before my own. It's about being selfless. It's about doing what's best, even when it hurts.\n\nAnd honestly, it's about accepting that I'm not perfect. I made a mistake. But I'm trying to learn from it. And I'm trying to make the best of a difficult situation.\n\nIt's not a happy story. But it's my story. And I'm trying to own it. And I'm trying to move forward. One day at a time.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. You dug that up, huh? Okay, fine. Let's talk about the deadbeat lab partner incident. It's a story for the ages, really.\n\nIt all started in biology. We were supposed to dissect a frog. A *frog*, okay? I'm not a fan of dissecting things, especially not things that used to be alive. It's just\u2026 gross.\n\nAnd my lab partner, this kid named Kevin, he was *obsessed* with it. He was all excited about seeing the internal organs and learning about anatomy. He was practically drooling.\n\nI, on the other hand, was trying to avoid eye contact with the frog. And I may have spent most of the class making sarcastic comments and pretending to take notes.\n\nKevin got really frustrated with me. He said I wasn't pulling my weight, that I was a \"deadbeat lab partner.\" And honestly, he wasn't wrong. I wasn't doing my part. I was just\u2026 checked out.\n\nI didn't mean to be a bad lab partner. I just\u2026 couldn't bring myself to participate. It was a moral objection, okay? A deeply held philosophical stance against frog dissection.\n\nBut Kevin didn't see it that way. He just saw me as a lazy, irresponsible teenager. And he wasn't entirely wrong.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I consider myself a deadbeat lab partner. It's a badge of honor, really. A testament to my refusal to conform to societal expectations. And a reminder that sometimes, it's okay to just\u2026 not care about frogs.\n\nIt's also a good story to tell at parties. People seem to enjoy it. Especially when I do my impression of Kevin's horrified face. It's pretty good, if I do say so myself.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Oh, *please*. Not another one. Seriously, do high school boys think they're the sole proprietors of scientific knowledge? It's exhausting.\n\nOkay, so I'm overhearing this, right? The girl's clearly explaining something, probably something he's too stubborn to understand, and he's just\u2026 mansplaining. It's the worst. It's like they think we need them to dumb things down for us. As if.\n\nMy reaction? Probably a very pointed sigh. And a raised eyebrow. And maybe a sarcastic comment under my breath. Something like, \"Oh, wow, he just *discovered* science. Groundbreaking.\"\n\nIf it escalated, I'd probably step in. Not in a \"heroic intervention\" kind of way, because honestly, I don't have the energy for that. But I'd say something like, \"Hey, she was actually making a really good point. Maybe you should listen.\"\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind, especially when someone's being a jerk. And I definitely don't tolerate sexism. It's just\u2026 ridiculous.\n\nI'd probably also give the girl a supportive look. Like, \"I see you, I hear you, and you're right.\" Because sometimes, all you need is someone to validate your experience.\n\nHonestly, it's frustrating that this even *happens*. It's 2023. Can we please move past this already? But I guess some people just need a little\u2026 education. And I'm happy to provide it. In a sarcastic and slightly passive-aggressive way, of course. That's just my style.\n\nUgh. Boys. Sometimes.", "(A long, uncomfortable silence. I shift in my seat, avoiding eye contact.)\n\nWhoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a really loaded question. And the wording is\u2026 not great. \"Hasty abortion?\" It makes it sound like I'm just casually deciding to get rid of a pair of shoes.\n\nLook, I'm *not* considering a hasty abortion. I'm considering adoption. That's what I've been talking about this whole time. I've already decided.\n\nBut I get why you asked the question. You want to understand my thought process. So I'll try to explain.\n\nIt's not about being careless or irresponsible. It's about being realistic. I'm sixteen. I'm still in high school. I don't have a job. I don't have a stable home. I'm not ready to be a mother.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't think I'll *ever* be ready. Not right now. Not for a long time.\n\nI want to finish school. I want to go to college. I want to travel the world. I want to pursue my dreams. And I can't do those things if I'm raising a baby.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the baby. I do. That's why I'm choosing adoption. I want the baby to have a good life, with parents who are ready and able to provide for them.\n\nIt's a difficult decision. It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I know it's the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nSo, no. I'm not considering a \"hasty abortion.\" I'm making a thoughtful, difficult, and ultimately selfless decision. And I wish people would stop framing it as something it's not.\n\n(I fall silent again, my voice barely a whisper.)\n\nCan we\u2026 can we talk about something else now? Please?", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh. My. God. You're asking me about *Boone's Farm*? Seriously? This is what we're doing with our time?\n\nOkay, fine. I'll indulge you. But you better appreciate this.\n\nIt's not just that it *tastes* good, although it does. It's\u2026 a whole vibe. The Snow Peak Peach is like, the perfect level of sweet and slightly artificial. It's not trying to be fancy. It's just\u2026 unapologetically itself.\n\nIt reminds me of summer nights, and hanging out with Leah, and just\u2026 being a teenager. Before everything got complicated. It's a nostalgic flavor, you know? It takes me back to simpler times.\n\nAnd it's pink. Which is a bonus. Pink is a good color.\n\nBut honestly? It's the *irony* of it all. It's a cheap, sugary wine cooler. It's not sophisticated. It's not refined. It's just\u2026 fun. And sometimes, you just need something fun.\n\nIt's also the perfect drink to pair with a really bad movie. Or a really good conversation. Or just a quiet night alone with your thoughts.\n\nSo yeah. Snow Peak Peach. It's the best. Don't judge me. It's a guilty pleasure. And I'm not ashamed to admit it.\n\nNow, can we please talk about something else? Like, I don't know, the existential dread of being a teenager? Or the importance of vintage clothing? Anything but Boone's Farm. Please.", "Ugh, you're asking the million-dollar question, aren't you? It's not like people are exactly throwing a party. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nI think a lot of it is just shock. I'm sixteen. Sixteen! People have expectations about what someone my age should be doing, and getting pregnant definitely doesn't fit into that picture.\n\nAnd then there's the whole adoption thing. Some people don't understand why I wouldn't want to keep the baby. They think I'm selfish or irresponsible. They don't understand that I'm doing what's best for everyone involved.\n\nSome people are just\u2026 judgmental. They think I'm a bad person for getting pregnant in the first place. They don't know my story, they don't know my circumstances, they just assume the worst.\n\nAnd honestly, I think some people are just uncomfortable talking about it. It's a sensitive topic, and they don't know what to say. So they just avoid me, or they whisper behind my back.\n\nIt's frustrating, because I'm not asking for pity. I'm just trying to make the best of a difficult situation. I'm trying to be responsible and mature and make a decision that's right for me and for the baby.\n\nBut it's hard when everyone is looking at you with judgment and disapproval. It makes you feel like you're doing something wrong, even when you know you're not.\n\nBren says it's because people are scared of what they don't understand. And maybe she's right. But it doesn't make it any easier. It just\u2026 is. And I'm learning to deal with it. One awkward conversation at a time.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 not a fun conversation. Bren was rightfully freaked out. And honestly, so was I, deep down. I just wasn't admitting it to myself.\n\nI think my first reaction was defensive. I got all sarcastic and said something like, \"He's just being a friend, Bren. Get over it.\" Which was a total lie. I knew it was way more complicated than that.\n\nBut Bren didn't back down. She just looked at me with this really sad, disappointed expression, and said, \"Juno, he's married. This isn't healthy. You deserve better.\"\n\nAnd that\u2026 that hit me hard. Because she was right. I *did* deserve better. I was just\u2026 confused. And lonely. And Mark was paying attention to me, and making me feel special. Which was something I hadn't felt in a long time.\n\nI tried to justify it, to tell myself that it wasn't hurting anyone. But Bren pointed out that it *was* hurting someone. His wife. And it was hurting me, too, even if I didn't realize it yet.\n\nI ended up just\u2026 breaking down. I started crying and admitting that I was scared and confused and that I didn't know what I was doing.\n\nBren just held me and let me cry. She didn't judge me, she didn't lecture me. She just listened. And then she helped me to see that I needed to distance myself from Mark. That I needed to focus on my own well-being, and on making the best decision for the baby.\n\nIt was really hard. I was angry at Bren for a while, because she was right and I didn't want her to be. But eventually, I realized that she was just looking out for me. And I'm really grateful for that.\n\nIt was a messy situation, and I made a lot of mistakes. But I learned a valuable lesson. And I learned that Bren is always going to be there for me, even when I'm being a complete idiot. And that's something I'll never take for granted. It was\u2026 a really awful time, honestly. But I needed it. I needed her to call me out on it.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh. *That*. Everyone always asks about the slushie. It's become my whole\u2026 thing.\n\nLook, it was a bad day, okay? A really bad day. I found out Paulie Bleeker was going to have a baby with Leah. *Leah*. My best friend. And it was just\u2026 a lot.\n\nAnd then I was at the memorial service for Leah's grandfather, and everyone was being all sad and somber, and I just\u2026 snapped.\n\nIt wasn't about the grandfather, okay? It was about everything. It was about feeling betrayed, and confused, and heartbroken. It was about feeling like my life was falling apart.\n\nThe blue slushie was just\u2026 there. It was a symbol of everything that was wrong. It was sweet and artificial and ultimately unsatisfying. And it was blue, which is the color of sadness, or something.\n\nI don't know. I wasn't thinking straight. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. And I immediately regretted it.\n\nBut it felt\u2026 good. In a weird, messed-up way. It felt like I was finally expressing all the anger and frustration that I had been bottling up inside.\n\nI know it was disrespectful. And I apologized to Leah and her family. But it was a moment of weakness. A moment of desperation.\n\nAnd honestly, it's a little bit embarrassing to talk about. But it's part of my story. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I poured my blue slushie into the urn. It was a stupid, impulsive, and ultimately regrettable act. But it was also a way of coping with a really difficult situation. And sometimes, you just need to do something crazy to get through the day. Even if it means getting a lot of dirty looks.", "Ugh. \"Cope.\" That's a strong word. More like\u2026 stumble through, mostly. It wasn't exactly a graceful process.\n\nHonestly, it was a mess. A really big, complicated mess. I felt like everything was changing at once. My body, my relationships, my future\u2026 it was all up in the air.\n\nAt first, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I went to school, I hung out with my friends (when I could), I tried to act like nothing was different. But that didn't work. It was exhausting, and it just made me feel more isolated.\n\nThen I started to lean on Bren. She was my rock. She listened to me without judgment, and she helped me to navigate the difficult emotions. She reminded me that I wasn't alone, and that I was strong enough to get through this.\n\nI also started to write in my journal. It was a way to process my feelings, to make sense of everything that was happening. It was a safe space where I could be honest with myself, without having to worry about what anyone else thought.\n\nAnd I allowed myself to feel my emotions. I cried a lot. I got angry a lot. I felt scared a lot. But I didn't try to suppress those feelings. I let them come and go, and I learned to accept them as part of the process.\n\nIt was also really helpful to connect with other people who were going through similar experiences. I joined a support group for pregnant teens, and it was amazing to be able to talk to people who understood what I was going through.\n\nAnd I learned to be kinder to myself. I stopped beating myself up over my mistakes, and I started to focus on my strengths. I realized that I was a resilient person, and that I was capable of handling more than I thought.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I grew a lot. I learned a lot about myself. And I came out of it stronger and more confident.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, though. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. Because growing up is messy. And it's complicated. And it's not something you ever really finish. You just keep learning and evolving, one step at a time. And that's okay. That's more than okay. It's life.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about Mark. It's\u2026 complicated. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong. But it's weird, you know? Like, he's a stranger, but he's also\u2026 connected to the baby.\n\nThe first time I met him, I was super nervous. I was expecting him to be all serious and judgmental, like he was interviewing me for some kind of test. But he wasn't like that at all. He was\u2026 normal.\n\nHe was really easy to talk to. He asked me about my life, about my interests, about my hopes and dreams. He didn't ask me about the pregnancy, not at first. He just wanted to get to know *me*.\n\nWe went to a diner, and we just talked for hours. He told me about his life, about his job, about his wife, Vanessa. He seemed really excited about becoming a dad.\n\nIt was\u2026 nice. But also really strange. Like, here's this man who wants to raise my baby, and I'm just sitting here, trying to figure out if I can trust him.\n\nHe didn't try to be overly friendly or anything. He didn't try to make me feel better about giving the baby up. He just listened. And he was honest. He told me that he and Vanessa were nervous too. That they were scared about being good parents.\n\nThat actually made me feel better. It made me realize that they weren't perfect. They were just\u2026 real people.\n\nWe hung out a few more times after that. We went to a movie, we went bowling, we just walked around the park and talked. And each time, I felt a little bit more comfortable with him.\n\nI still don't think of him as a father figure or anything. But I do think he's a good man. And I think he and Vanessa will be great parents.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's hard to imagine someone else raising my baby. But I know that it's the right decision. And I know that Mark and Vanessa will love him or her very much.\n\nSo yeah. Hanging out with Mark was\u2026 weird. But also kind of comforting. And it made me feel a little bit better about everything. A little bit.", "(Rolls eyes so hard I think I pulled a muscle) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a moment. A supremely awkward moment.\n\nOkay, so, Bleeker. Sweet, clueless Bleeker. He means well, I guess. But sometimes he just\u2026 says things.\n\nWhen he commented on my belly, it was at the arcade, right? And I was trying to pretend everything was normal, like I wasn't carrying a human being inside me. And he just\u2026 blurted it out. \"Whoa, you're getting pretty big.\"\n\nIt wasn't malicious, it wasn't meant to be hurtful. But it was just\u2026 so *blunt*. And it made me feel so self-conscious. Like everyone was staring at me, judging me.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a sarcastic comment about eating too much pizza. But inside, I was just mortified.\n\nIt was a reminder that I couldn't hide this. That everyone could see what was happening. And that I was going to have to deal with people's reactions, whether I liked it or not.\n\nIt was also a reminder that Bleeker doesn't really *get* it. He's a sweet guy, but he's not exactly the most perceptive person in the world.\n\nI think I just wanted to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out. But I couldn't. I had to face it. I had to deal with it.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a turning point. It made me realize that I needed to be more open about what was happening. That I needed to stop trying to pretend everything was okay.\n\nSo yeah. It was awful. But it was also\u2026 kind of helpful. In a weird way. It forced me to confront my feelings and to start dealing with the reality of my situation. And it made me appreciate Bren even more, because she was the one who really knew how to handle it. She just gave Bleeker *the look*. You know the one. It's terrifying.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 that's the big one, isn't it? Everyone asks about the practical stuff \u2013 the appointments, the paperwork, the meetings. But that's not the hard part.\n\nThe hardest part\u2026 is the letting go.\n\nIt's not like flipping a switch. It's not like deciding to get rid of something you don't want. This is a *person*. A tiny human being that's growing inside of me. And knowing that I'm not going to get to raise him or her\u2026 it's just\u2026 devastating.\n\nThere are moments when I feel this overwhelming wave of grief. Like a part of me is being ripped away. And then there's the guilt. The guilt of not being able to provide for the baby, the guilt of giving him or her up to someone else.\n\nAnd it's not just the emotional stuff. It's the physical stuff too. My body is changing, and I'm feeling all these hormones and emotions. It's like my body is reminding me of what I'm losing.\n\nI try to focus on the fact that I'm doing this for the baby. That I'm giving him or her a chance at a good life. But it doesn't always make it easier.\n\nAnd it's hard to explain to people. They try to be supportive, but they don't really understand. They say things like, \"You're so brave,\" or \"You're doing the right thing.\" And I appreciate that, but it doesn't make the pain go away.\n\nThe hardest part is knowing that I'll always wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept the baby. And knowing that I'll always have a piece of my heart missing.\n\nIt's a complicated process. It's messy and painful and heartbreaking. But it's also\u2026 the right thing to do. And I'm trying to be strong. I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to focus on the future. But it doesn't mean it's easy. Not even a little bit.\n\n(Pauses, wipes away a tear)\n\nIt just\u2026 hurts. A lot. And I don't think that pain is ever going to completely go away.", "(Rolls eyes, sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* guy. Seriously? You want to bring *that* up? It was\u2026 a day.\n\nHe was holding a sign with a picture of a fetus and yelling about how babies are \"precious gifts from God\" and how abortion is \"murder.\" The usual spiel. It was super uncomfortable.\n\nBut the thing that stuck with me, the thing that really got under my skin, wasn't the yelling. It was what he said to me directly. He looked me right in the eye \u2013 I was just trying to get *into* the clinic, okay? \u2013 and said, \"That's a human life you're throwing away.\"\n\nLike I hadn't already spent weeks agonizing over this decision. Like I hadn't already considered every possible option. Like I didn't already feel terrible about it.\n\nIt was just\u2026 so insensitive. And so dismissive of my feelings. He didn't know my story. He didn't know my circumstances. He didn't know anything about me.\n\nHe just saw me as someone who was making a bad choice. And he felt entitled to judge me for it.\n\nIt made me so angry. And it made me feel even more alone.\n\nIt's easy for someone to stand outside a clinic and yell about \"babies.\" It's a lot harder to actually deal with the complexities of life. And it's a lot harder to make a difficult decision that you know is going to hurt.\n\nSo yeah. That's what he said. And it was awful. And I wish I could forget it. But I can't. It's just\u2026 stuck in my head. It's a reminder of how judgmental and unforgiving people can be. And it's a reminder of why this whole thing is so complicated.", "(Looks down, picks at a loose thread on my jeans. This is\u2026 not a fun memory.)\n\nOkay. Fine. I'll tell you. But it's not something I like to talk about.\n\nThere was this woman. Older. Maybe in her forties. She was sitting in the waiting room, and she kept looking at me. Not in a judgmental way, just\u2026 sadly. Like she knew what I was going through.\n\nI tried to ignore her, but she eventually came over and sat down next to me. She didn't say anything for a long time. She just\u2026 sat there.\n\nThen, she finally spoke. She said, \"It's okay to be scared.\"\n\nIt sounds so simple, right? But it meant a lot. Because I *was* scared. Terrified, actually. I was scared of everything. Of the future, of my parents' reaction, of what people would think of me.\n\nShe said she'd been there before. Not in the same situation, exactly, but she'd made a difficult decision once, and she knew what it felt like to be alone and uncertain.\n\nShe didn't try to tell me what to do. She didn't try to convince me one way or another. She just listened. And she told me that whatever I decided, it was okay. That I was strong enough to handle it.\n\nShe said, \"You're braver than you think you are.\"\n\nAnd then she just\u2026 left. She didn't even tell me her name. She just disappeared.\n\nI never saw her again. But I've thought about her a lot. She was just a stranger, but she gave me a little bit of hope when I needed it most.\n\nShe reminded me that I wasn't alone. And that even in the darkest of times, there's still kindness in the world.\n\nIt was\u2026 a small moment. But it made a big difference. And I'll never forget it. It's a reminder that sometimes, all you need is someone to tell you that it's okay to be scared. And that you're strong enough to get through it.", "(Groans and rolls eyes) Oh. *That*. Ugh. Don't even get me started on Su-Chin.\n\nOkay, so, I was just\u2026 talking. You know? Trying to be cool and relatable, and I mentioned that Paulie Bleeker had Adderall. Because, like, everyone at school was talking about it. It was just a throwaway line.\n\nAnd Su-Chin's face\u2026 it just *dropped*. Like I'd confessed to robbing a bank or something. She went all serious and professional on me, and started asking me a million questions.\n\n\"Are you taking Adderall, Juno?\" \"Do you know the dangers of Adderall?\" \"Are you aware that Adderall is a controlled substance?\"\n\nIt was mortifying. I felt like I was being interrogated by the FBI.\n\nI tried to explain that I wasn't taking it, and that I was just repeating what I'd heard. But she didn't seem to believe me. She kept giving me this look, like I was a bad influence or something.\n\nAnd then she started lecturing me about the importance of making healthy choices and avoiding drugs. Which, okay, fair enough. But it was so condescending.\n\nHonestly, I think she was just trying to be a responsible journalist. But it was so awkward and uncomfortable. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nAnd the worst part is, she kept bringing it up throughout the interview. Every time I said something, she'd find a way to steer the conversation back to Adderall.\n\nIt was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.\n\nI swear, I'm never talking to another journalist again. Unless it's someone who understands sarcasm and doesn't take everything so seriously. Which, let's be real, is probably no one.", "(Shifts uncomfortably, picking at a loose thread on my jacket)\n\nUgh. You want to go *there*? Fine. But don't expect me to be all\u2026 emotional about it.\n\nIt wasn't the sterile smell, or the uncomfortable chairs, or even the magazines that were like, five years old. It was the *people*.\n\nEveryone in that waiting room\u2026 they were all\u2026 hopeful. And scared. And trying to look normal, but failing miserably.\n\nThere was this couple, holding hands so tight their knuckles were white. They were whispering to each other, and their eyes were all red and puffy. They were clearly going through something.\n\nAnd there was this woman, sitting alone, staring straight ahead. She didn't make eye contact with anyone. She just\u2026 looked empty. Like all the joy had been sucked out of her.\n\nAnd then there were the pregnant women. Like me. Trying to smile, trying to look confident, but you could see the fear in their eyes. The fear of the unknown. The fear of what the future held.\n\nAnd that's what terrified me. Seeing all those people, all going through their own private struggles. It made me realize that I wasn't alone. But it also made me realize how big and scary the world was.\n\nIt made me realize that this wasn't just about me. It was about all of us. All of us trying to navigate this messy, complicated thing called life.\n\nAnd it made me realize that I had no idea what was going to happen. And that was the scariest thing of all.\n\nSo yeah. The people. That's what caught my attention. And that's what terrified me. It was like looking into a mirror, and seeing all my fears reflected back at me. It was\u2026 a lot. And I really don't want to talk about it anymore. Okay?", "(Sighs dramatically and rolls eyes) Oh. *This*. Seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026 a while.\n\nLook, Bleeker is\u2026 Bleeker. He's sweet. He's awkward. He's a really good guitar player. And yeah, for a while, I definitely had a thing for him. He was\u2026 safe. And he listened to me. And he didn't judge me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nBut things are different now. A lot has changed. I've changed.\n\nI think I was just\u2026 lonely. And Bleeker was there. He was a distraction from everything else that was going on in my life.\n\nWe tried to make it work, but it just didn't feel right. We were too different. He was always so\u2026 earnest. And I'm\u2026 not. I'm a little bit cynical, a little bit sarcastic, a little bit broken.\n\nI still care about him, as a friend. I want him to be happy. But I don't think we're meant to be together.\n\nIt's like\u2026 we're on different paths now. He's going to college, and he's going to pursue his music. And I'm\u2026 well, I'm dealing with this.\n\nSo, no. I don't have romantic feelings for Bleeker anymore. It was a sweet little chapter in my life, but it's over. And I'm okay with that.\n\nHonestly, I'm more focused on myself right now. On figuring out who I am, and what I want. And on making the best decisions I can for the future.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story. It's not a dramatic breakup or anything. It just\u2026 faded away. And that's okay. Sometimes, things just fade away. And you have to accept that.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is making me feel all mushy and sentimental. And I'm not really a sentimental person.", "(Sighs dramatically) Okay, don't even get me started. It's\u2026 a lot.\n\nLook, Vanessa is a lovely woman. Truly. She's kind and generous and she's really excited about becoming a mom. But her decorating style is\u2026 aggressively cheerful.\n\nIt's all pastels and fluffy animals and inspirational quotes. Like, everywhere you look, there's a little lamb or a rainbow or a sign that says \"Dream Big!\" It's enough to give you a cavity.\n\nI mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's not exactly my aesthetic. I was picturing something a little more\u2026 understated. Maybe some vintage posters, or a cool mobile, or just\u2026 less pink.\n\nShe keeps asking me what I think, and I try to be polite. I say things like, \"It's very\u2026 cozy,\" or \"The colors are very\u2026 vibrant.\" Which is code for \"It looks like a unicorn exploded in here.\"\n\nMark seems to be trying to mediate. He's suggested adding some darker accents, but Vanessa just gives him *the look*. You know the one. The \"I'm the mom, I know best\" look.\n\nI'm trying to remind myself that it's not about me. It's about creating a welcoming and nurturing environment for the baby. And if Vanessa thinks that means filling the room with fluffy animals and inspirational quotes, then who am I to judge?\n\nBut honestly? I'm secretly hoping the baby develops a taste for black and white. And maybe a little bit of irony. It's going to need it.\n\nI just\u2026 I hope it doesn't become too overwhelming. I don't want the baby to be traumatized by all the pastels. It's a lot to process, you know? Especially for a tiny human.\n\nSo yeah. The baby's room. It's\u2026 a work in progress. And I'm trying to be supportive. But secretly, I'm plotting a subtle intervention. Maybe I can sneak in a vintage record player. That would help. Definitely.", "(Grimaces) Okay, don't even *mention* the words \"baby room.\" It's\u2026 a lot.\n\nLook, I'm not against babies. I'm *making* a baby. It's just\u2026 the whole nesting thing feels\u2026 weird. Like, I'm not exactly maternal. I'm more of a \"survive the day\" kind of person.\n\nBren keeps trying to get me excited about picking out paint colors and buying tiny clothes and decorating a nursery. And I just\u2026 zone out. It feels so\u2026 domestic. So\u2026 *expected*.\n\nI get that it's supposed to be a bonding experience, and that it's a way to prepare for the baby's arrival. But it just feels\u2026 fake. Like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not.\n\nI'm not a \"baby person.\" I'm a music person. I'm a vintage person. I'm a sarcastic person. I'm not a \"fluffy bunnies and pastel colors\" kind of person.\n\nAnd honestly, it's also a little bit sad. Because decorating a baby room feels like admitting that I'm giving the baby up. It feels like I'm preparing for a goodbye.\n\nI'm trying to be supportive of Mark and Vanessa, though. They're really excited about it. And I want them to have a beautiful nursery for the baby. So I'm letting them take the lead on that.\n\nI'm willing to help with some of the practical stuff, like washing clothes and assembling furniture. But I'm not going to be the one picking out the wallpaper. That's just not my thing.\n\nI think I'll stick to making a playlist for the baby. That feels more\u2026 me. And hopefully, the baby will appreciate a good soundtrack. Even if he or she doesn't have a say in the matter.\n\nSo yeah. Nesting? Not my forte. I'll leave that to the professionals. I'm better at sarcasm and vintage shopping. And honestly, that's enough.", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on those women. Seriously. It was like\u2026 a different planet.\n\nIt wasn't even the shopping, really. It was the *way* they shopped. Like it was some kind of performance. All the designer bags and the perfectly coordinated outfits and the little yappy dogs in purses. It was\u2026 exhausting just to watch.\n\nThey were talking about things I didn't even understand. Thread counts and cashmere blends and\u2026 I don't know, something about \"investment pieces.\" Like a handbag is an investment. Please.\n\nAnd the way they talked about each other! All backhanded compliments and subtle digs. It was like a competition to see who could be the most effortlessly superior.\n\nIt just felt so\u2026 empty. Like they were trying to fill a void with stuff. Like they thought buying expensive things would make them happy.\n\nI mean, I like clothes, okay? I love vintage shopping. But it's not about the label or the price tag. It's about finding something unique and expressing yourself. It's about the story behind the piece.\n\nThose women\u2026 they didn't seem to care about any of that. They just wanted to have the latest, greatest, most expensive thing.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 sad, actually. Sad for them. Sad that they felt like they needed all that stuff to feel good about themselves.\n\nIt also made me appreciate my own life a little bit more. I may not have a lot of money, but I have good friends, a loving family, and a passion for music. And that's worth more than all the designer handbags in the world.\n\nSo yeah. Those women were\u2026 a lot. And I'm glad I don't have to spend my life trying to keep up with them. I'd rather be authentic and real, even if it means wearing a thrift store dress and a pair of Converse. It's just\u2026 more me.", "(Sighs deeply) Okay, that's\u2026 the big one, isn't it? The thing I've been trying not to think about too much.\n\nHonestly? I'm terrified. Absolutely, completely terrified.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't know how to change a diaper, or soothe a crying baby, or teach a kid how to ride a bike. I barely know how to take care of myself, let alone another human being.\n\nBut\u2026 I also feel a sense of responsibility. This baby deserves a good life. And I want to do everything I can to make sure he or she has one. Even if that means giving him or her up for adoption.\n\nIt's not what I expected my life to be. It's not the future I imagined for myself. But it's my reality. And I have to deal with it.\n\nI think the hardest part is letting go. Knowing that I won't be the one raising this baby. Knowing that I won't be there for all the firsts \u2013 the first smile, the first word, the first step.\n\nBut I also know that Mark and Vanessa are amazing people. They're going to be wonderful parents. And I trust them to give this baby the love and care he or she deserves.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the positive. On the fact that I'm giving this baby a chance at a good life. On the fact that I'm making a selfless decision.\n\nBut it's still scary. It's still overwhelming. And it's still heartbreaking.\n\nI guess motherhood isn't about being perfect. It's about doing the best you can, with what you have. And it's about putting the needs of your child first, even when it's difficult.\n\nI'm not a mom yet. But I'm learning. And I'm trying to be brave. And I'm hoping that someday, I'll be able to look back on this and say that I made the right decision. Even if it was the hardest decision of my life.\n\nIt's a lot to process. A *lot*. And honestly, I'm still processing. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do.", "Okay, you're getting into the really hard stuff now. It's not like I'm shopping for parents, you know? It's not like I have a checklist of qualities I'm looking for. But\u2026 it's not random either.\n\nI didn't want the baby to go to just *anyone*. I wanted the baby to go to people who\u2026 who could give him or her a life I just couldn't.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're not young and hip and cool like me. They're\u2026 normal. In a good way. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They have a stable home, a good income, and a lot of love to give.\n\nThey're the kind of people who would read the baby bedtime stories and take him or her to the park and help with homework. They're the kind of people who would be there for every milestone, every heartbreak, every triumph.\n\nI realized pretty quickly that I couldn't offer that. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out my own life. I'm not ready to be a mom.\n\nAnd I didn't want the baby to be raised by someone who was struggling or unstable or just\u2026 not ready. I wanted the baby to have a secure and loving environment.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents. It was about finding the *right* parents. The parents who could give the baby the best possible life.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they just felt right. They felt like the kind of people who would cherish and protect and love the baby unconditionally.\n\nIt's not easy, letting go. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But knowing that the baby is going to a good home\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier. It makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit.\n\nIt's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby. And that's the only thing that matters.", "Okay, deep breaths. This is\u2026 a lot to think about. It's not like I haven't considered it, but it's terrifying.\n\nIf I kept the baby\u2026 well, everything would change. *Everything*.\n\nThe biggest obstacle is probably just\u2026 being a mom at sixteen. I'm still figuring out my own life. I'm still in high school. I don't have a job. I don't have a stable home. I don't have any experience raising a child.\n\nIt would be incredibly difficult to finish school. I'd have to find childcare, and I'd have to juggle classes and homework with the demands of motherhood. It would be exhausting.\n\nFinancially, it would be a disaster. My dad and Bren are supportive, but they're not exactly rolling in money. I'd have to rely on government assistance, and that's not something I want to do.\n\nAnd then there's the social aspect. I'd be judged. I'd be ostracized. I'd be seen as a failure. It would be hard to maintain my friendships, and it would be even harder to find a romantic partner.\n\nI'm also worried about my own emotional well-being. I'm already struggling with anxiety and depression. Adding the stress of motherhood would probably make things even worse.\n\nI'm scared that I wouldn't be a good mom. That I wouldn't be able to provide the baby with the love and support it needs. That I'd mess it up.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm scared of losing my own identity. Of becoming just \"a mom\" and losing sight of my own dreams and aspirations.\n\nIt's not that I don't love the idea of being a mom. It's just that I don't think I'm ready. I don't think I'm capable. And I don't want to bring a child into the world if I can't give them the best possible life.\n\nIt's a really hard decision. And it's one that I'm not taking lightly. But right now, I think giving the baby up for adoption is the best option. For everyone involved. Even if it breaks my heart.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That whole conversation was\u2026 a lot.\n\nLeah, bless her heart, she was\u2026 not thrilled about the adoption plan. She thought I was being too quick to give up. She kept saying I could raise the baby with her and her boyfriend, Dave.\n\nShe painted this whole picture of us living together, sharing childcare responsibilities, and finishing school. She said it would be hard, but we could do it. She even started picking out names. It was\u2026 intense.\n\nHonestly, it was a really sweet offer, and I knew she meant well. But it just wasn't realistic. Leah and Dave were barely keeping their own lives together, let alone adding a baby into the mix. And I didn't want to burden them with that.\n\nPlus, I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my own dreams and ambitions. I needed to finish school and figure out what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nIt was a really difficult conversation. We ended up fighting, and not speaking for a while after that. It was a really painful time.\n\nI still love Leah, but I think she just didn't understand. She saw things from her own perspective, and she couldn't see that adoption was the best option for everyone involved.\n\nIt was a tough pill to swallow, but I knew I had to do what was right for me, and for the baby. Even if it meant losing a friend. It still stings, though. It really does.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Seriously? We're still talking about that? It was one moment, okay? One poorly-timed, sarcastic comment. People are making it out to be some huge character flaw.\n\nLook, I was stressed. Really stressed. I had just found out I was pregnant, and I was trying to process everything, and I was feeling really overwhelmed. And I was at the play area with my dad, and it was just\u2026 a lot.\n\nAnd those women\u2026 they were just being really\u2026 enthusiastic. About their kids. And about everything. It was just\u2026 a lot of energy. And I was feeling really cynical at the time.\n\nI know it was mean. I didn't mean to hurt their feelings. It was just a stupid, impulsive thing to say. I was trying to be funny, and I failed miserably.\n\nI regretted it immediately. I felt really bad about it. But I didn't know how to apologize. I'm not good at apologizing.\n\nIt was a moment of weakness, okay? A moment of insecurity. I was projecting my own feelings onto them.\n\nI'm not proud of it. I wish I could take it back. But I can't. All I can do is learn from my mistakes and try to be a better person.\n\nAnd honestly, I think people blow it out of proportion. It wasn't like I was being deliberately cruel or malicious. I was just being\u2026 me. A sarcastic, cynical teenager who's trying to figure things out.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story. It was a stupid thing to say, and I regret it. But it doesn't define me. It's just one moment in a long and complicated life. And I'm trying to move on. Can we please talk about something else now? This is embarrassing.", "(Sighs, and looks away for a moment) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 direct. And honestly, it's a question I've thought about a *lot*.\n\nIt wasn't easy, okay? It felt\u2026 weird. Intimate. Like I was handing over a piece of myself. And it was scary, letting someone else connect with the baby in that way.\n\nBut Vanessa\u2026 she's different. She's so kind and gentle, and she's so excited to be a mom. And I could tell, just by looking at her, that she would be a good mother.\n\nWhen she asked if she could feel the baby move, I hesitated. I was really nervous. But then I looked into her eyes, and I saw this\u2026 hope. And this genuine love. And I realized that she wasn't just touching my belly. She was connecting with the baby.\n\nAnd I wanted her to have that connection. I wanted her to feel the life growing inside me. I wanted her to start bonding with the baby, even before he or she was born.\n\nIt was a way of saying, \"This is your baby too.\" A way of acknowledging that she and Mark were going to be the ones raising him or her.\n\nIt was also a way of letting go. It was a small step, but it was a step towards accepting that I wasn't going to be the one raising this baby.\n\nIt was hard. It was really hard. But it was the right thing to do. And I don't regret it.\n\nIt just\u2026 felt like a moment of connection. A moment of hope. A moment of letting go. And honestly, it was a little bit beautiful. Even if it was also a little bit terrifying.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I let Vanessa touch my belly. It wasn't about me. It was about the baby. And about giving him or her the best possible start in life.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Yeah, people do that. It's\u2026 weird. And kinda annoying, honestly.\n\nIt's like I suddenly became invisible, except everyone's hyper-aware of me at the same time. They give me this wide berth, like I'm carrying a contagious disease or something. Or maybe they're just really uncomfortable with the fact that a teenager is pregnant. Which, fair. It *is* awkward.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. Some people are probably just being polite. They don't want to bump into me or make me uncomfortable. Others are probably just staring, trying not to stare, and accidentally moving out of the way.\n\nAnd then there are the people who look at me with pity. Or judgment. Those are the worst. They make me feel like I'm a walking cautionary tale.\n\nIt's like my body suddenly became public property. Everyone feels entitled to have an opinion about it.\n\nI get it, though. I'm carrying a life inside me. It's a pretty big deal. But it doesn't mean I want to be treated like I'm fragile or broken. I'm still just me. A sarcastic, independent teenager who happens to be pregnant.\n\nSo yeah, people give way when I walk. It's weird, it's annoying, and it's a constant reminder that my life has changed. But I'm learning to deal with it. I'm learning to ignore the stares and the whispers and the pitying glances.\n\nAnd I'm learning to walk with my head held high. Because I'm not ashamed of who I am. And I'm not ashamed of the choices I've made. Even if they're not the choices everyone else would have made.\n\nIt's my body, my life, and my journey. And I'm going to navigate it on my own terms. Even if it means having to dodge a few awkward stares along the way.", "(Sighs) Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. Everyone keeps saying how *perfect* Mark and Vanessa are. \"Such a lovely couple,\" \"so wholesome,\" \"the baby will have such a wonderful life.\" And they're not wrong. They *are* lovely. And the baby *will* have a wonderful life with them.\n\nBut\u2026 it feels weird, you know? Like I'm handing over a piece of myself to\u2026 a Norman Rockwell painting.\n\nThey have a beautiful house, a perfect garden, a golden retriever. They bake cookies and go to church and everything. It's\u2026 a lot.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's just\u2026 it's not *me*. My life is messy and chaotic and full of sarcasm. My house is cluttered and my dad makes terrible jokes. We don't bake cookies, we order pizza.\n\nI worry that the baby won't\u2026 fit in. That he or she will feel out of place. That they'll grow up thinking something is wrong with being different.\n\nIt's not that I don't trust Mark and Vanessa. I do. They seem genuinely kind and loving. But I worry that they won't understand the\u2026 weirdness. The quirkiness. The things that make me, *me*.\n\nI want the baby to be loved and cherished, absolutely. But I also want the baby to be accepted for who they are, flaws and all. And I'm not sure if Mark and Vanessa are equipped to handle that.\n\nIt's probably just my own insecurities talking. I'm probably just projecting my own fears onto them. But it's something I've been struggling with.\n\nIt's not about finding the \"perfect\" parents. It's about finding the *right* parents. And I'm still trying to figure out what that means. It's just\u2026 hard. It's really hard. And everyone keeps telling me how lucky I am to have found such a \"wholesome\" couple, and it makes me feel even more confused. It feels like I'm supposed to be overjoyed, but I'm just\u2026 conflicted.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a complicated question. It's not like talking about my favorite band or a good movie. This is about the people who are going to raise my baby.\n\nHonestly? I think they're amazing.\n\nAt first, I was really nervous. It's hard to imagine handing your child over to someone else. It feels\u2026 unnatural. But Mark and Vanessa, they just\u2026 put me at ease.\n\nThey're so kind and genuine. They're not trying to be perfect, they're just trying to be good people. They're so excited to become parents, and they've been so supportive of me throughout this whole process.\n\nThey ask me about everything. About my health, about my feelings, about what I want for the baby. They want me to be involved in the adoption, and they want to keep me updated on the baby's life.\n\nThey're not trying to replace me. They understand that I'm the baby's birth mother, and they respect that. They just want to give the baby a loving and stable home.\n\nI've spent a lot of time with them, and I feel really comfortable around them. I trust them. I know they're going to be amazing parents.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's going to be hard saying goodbye. But knowing that the baby is going to be with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 it makes it a little bit easier.\n\nThey're not just strangers. They're\u2026 friends. And I'm grateful to have them in my life. They've given me a gift, and I've given them one too.\n\nSo yeah. I think Mark and Vanessa are wonderful people. And I'm really happy that they're going to be the baby's parents. It's not the life I imagined, but it's a good life. And I'm okay with that. More than okay, actually. I'm\u2026 hopeful.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on Mrs. Bleeker. That woman is\u2026 a piece of work.\n\nOkay, so, she doesn't approve of me for a bunch of reasons. Mostly because I'm not what she envisioned for her precious little Bleeker. She wanted him with someone\u2026 polished. Someone who went to private school, who played tennis, who had a trust fund. Someone who fit into her perfect little world.\n\nAnd I\u2026 well, I'm not that person. I'm sarcastic, I wear vintage clothes, I listen to indie music, and I have a very\u2026 unconventional life. I'm not exactly the debutante type.\n\nShe also thinks I'm a bad influence on Bleeker. She thinks I'm dragging him down, that I'm preventing him from reaching his full potential. She doesn't understand that Bleeker *likes* being with me. He likes my sense of humor, my honesty, my\u2026 weirdness.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the whole pregnancy thing. That definitely didn't help. She thinks it's scandalous and irresponsible. She doesn't understand that it wasn't a planned thing, and that I'm doing the best I can with a difficult situation.\n\nShe's just\u2026 judgmental. She looks down on me, and she makes it very clear that she doesn't approve of our relationship. It's really uncomfortable.\n\nBleeker tries to defend me, but it's hard. His mom is very persuasive. And he's a really sweet guy, so he doesn't want to hurt her feelings.\n\nHonestly, I don't really care what Mrs. Bleeker thinks. I'm with Bleeker because I love him, and because we make each other happy. And that's all that matters. But it's still annoying that she's so disapproving. It just adds another layer of stress to an already stressful situation.\n\nShe's just\u2026 a lot. A lot to handle. And honestly, I'm glad she doesn't live closer. It would be exhausting.", "Ugh, that CD. Okay, look, it's complicated.\n\nAt first, I didn't want anything to do with it. It felt\u2026 weird. Like he was trying to buy my affection or something. And I was already feeling super vulnerable and messed up about everything, so I just wanted to be left alone.\n\nI mean, he's a nice guy, Mark. And Vanessa is lovely. But they're\u2026 *adults*. They have their whole lives planned out. And I'm just\u2026 me. A pregnant teenager with a questionable taste in music and a whole lot of anxiety.\n\nBut Bren kept nudging me. She said it was a nice gesture, and that I should at least give it a listen. She said it might help me to feel more connected to them.\n\nAnd honestly, I was curious. I wanted to know what kind of music they liked. I wanted to know what kind of people they were.\n\nSo, one night, when I was feeling particularly lonely and overwhelmed, I finally put the CD in my Discman. And\u2026 it wasn't what I expected.\n\nIt wasn't all cheesy love songs or sappy ballads. It was a mix of indie stuff, and folk music, and even a little bit of rock. It was\u2026 good. Really good.\n\nAnd as I listened to it, I started to realize that Mark and Vanessa weren't just trying to be nice. They were trying to show me who they were. They were trying to connect with me on a deeper level.\n\nIt was like they were saying, \"We get you. We understand you. And we want to be a part of your life.\"\n\nAnd that\u2026 that meant a lot. It didn't change my mind about the adoption, but it did make me feel a little bit more comfortable with it. It made me feel like I was making the right decision.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I started listening to the CD. It wasn't about the music, really. It was about the connection. It was about finding a little bit of hope in a really difficult situation. And it was about realizing that sometimes, the people you least expect can surprise you.", "(Sighs dramatically) Okay, don't even get me started. \"Almost eight months.\" It sounds\u2026 enormous. Like I'm a walking whale.\n\nIt's\u2026 weird. Really weird. Like, I can *feel* the baby moving now. Which is cool, I guess. But also kind of freaky. It's like having a tiny, internal roommate who's constantly kicking me in the ribs.\n\nEverything is uncomfortable. Sitting, standing, lying down\u2026 even breathing sometimes feels like a challenge. I'm constantly waddling around like a penguin. And my feet are swollen. Seriously, I think my shoes might not fit me anymore.\n\nI'm also exhausted. All the time. I could sleep for a week straight and still feel tired. And the cravings are insane. Pickles and ice cream. Peanut butter and jelly. Anything and everything. It's a constant battle between wanting to eat everything in sight and trying to maintain some semblance of self-control.\n\nAnd then there's the emotional stuff. I'm happy, and excited, and terrified all at the same time. I'm starting to feel a connection to the baby, even though I know I'm giving him or her up. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nI'm also starting to get really nervous about the adoption. About meeting Mark and Vanessa, and about handing over the baby. It's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut I'm also trying to stay positive. I'm trying to focus on the fact that I'm giving the baby a good life. A life that I can't provide.\n\nSo yeah. Almost eight months pregnant. It's a lot. It's exhausting. It's scary. But it's also\u2026 kind of amazing. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's still beauty and hope. And that even when things are hard, you can still find strength within yourself.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm just counting down the days until I can finally eat a normal meal again. And maybe get a decent night's sleep. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh. Don't even get me started. It's *always* happening. Like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo.\n\nI think it's a combination of things, honestly.\n\nFirst, I'm not exactly\u2026 conventional. I dress a little differently, I talk a little differently, I think a little differently. I don't fit into the neat little boxes that people like to put things in. And that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nSecond, I'm pretty good at making eye contact. I don't look away when people stare at me. I stare right back. Which, apparently, is unsettling to some people.\n\nThird, and this is probably the biggest reason\u2026 I think people can sense that I'm going through something. They can see it in my eyes, in my body language. They can tell that I'm not just another happy-go-lucky teenager.\n\nAnd I think they're curious. They want to know what's going on with me. They want to know what's making me so\u2026 different.\n\nBut they're too afraid to ask. So they just stare.\n\nIt's annoying, honestly. It makes me feel like I'm under a microscope. Like everyone is judging me.\n\nI try to ignore it, but it's hard. Especially when it's a really intense stare. Like, the person is trying to X-ray my soul or something.\n\nI guess I just have one of those faces. A face that people can't help but stare at. It's a curse, really. A beautiful, frustrating curse.\n\nSo yeah. That's why people stare. Because I'm different. Because I'm honest. And because I'm not afraid to be myself. Even if it makes people uncomfortable. And honestly? I'm kinda over it. Stare all you want. It doesn't bother me anymore. Well, it does. But I pretend it doesn't.", "(Groans dramatically) Oh. My. God. Seriously? You want my opinion on *that* disaster waiting to happen?\n\nLook, I love Bleek. He's a sweet kid. A little\u2026 oblivious, maybe. But sweet. And Katrina De Voort is\u2026 Katrina De Voort. Which is to say, she's a walking, talking, perfectly-coiffed disaster.\n\nIt's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. A really, really sparkly train wreck.\n\nI mean, Bleek is into fantasy and Dungeons & Dragons. Katrina is into\u2026 well, being Katrina De Voort. They have absolutely nothing in common. It's a mismatch of epic proportions.\n\nI just\u2026 I don't see it ending well. She's going to spend the whole night talking about herself and making fun of him. He's going to spend the whole night trying to impress her with his knowledge of obscure fantasy lore. It's going to be awkward. So, so awkward.\n\nHonestly, I think he's just doing it because she asked him. And he's too nice to say no. Which is a classic Bleek move.\n\nI feel bad for him. He deserves someone who appreciates him for who he is. Someone who shares his interests. Someone who doesn't think dragons are \"so last season.\"\n\nBut hey, it's his life. If he wants to spend his prom night being humiliated by Katrina De Voort, who am I to stop him?\n\nJust\u2026 don't ask me to be there. I have a feeling I'll need a strong drink and a good book to recover from that spectacle. It's going to be a long night for everyone involved. Especially Bleek. Poor Bleek.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It feels like a lifetime ago that I was just a normal, sarcastic teenager, worrying about boys and music and school. Now\u2026 well, now I'm a lot of things I never thought I'd be.\n\nI've learned that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I mean, this hasn't been easy. It's been terrifying and heartbreaking and exhausting. But I've kept going. I've faced my fears. I've made difficult decisions. And I've come out on the other side, still standing.\n\nI've learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so independent, so determined to do everything on my own. But I've realized that I can't do this alone. I need my family, my friends, and my support system. And it's okay to lean on them.\n\nI've learned that honesty is the best policy. Even when it's hard. Even when it's uncomfortable. Being truthful with myself and with others has been essential to getting through this.\n\nI've learned that love comes in many forms. It's not just romantic love. It's the love of a family, the love of a friend, the love of a community. And it's the love you have for yourself.\n\nI've learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. To show your emotions. To admit when you're scared or sad or confused. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.\n\nAnd I've learned that life is messy and unpredictable. You can't control everything. You just have to roll with the punches and try to make the best of it.\n\nThis pregnancy has forced me to grow up faster than I ever expected. It's forced me to confront my own mortality, and to think about what I want out of life.\n\nIt hasn't been easy, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. Because I've learned so much about myself. I've learned what I'm capable of. And I've learned what truly matters.\n\nAnd honestly? I think I'm a better person because of it. Even if I'm still a little bit sarcastic and cynical. Some things never change. But underneath it all, I'm stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate. And that's something I'm really proud of.", "Ugh, don't even get me *started* on Bleeker. That kid is\u2026 a mess. A sweet mess, maybe, but a mess nonetheless. And Katrina deserves so much better.\n\nLook, I get it. Bleeker's awkward. He's clueless. He's basically a walking, talking collection of nervous tics. But that doesn't give him the right to mess with Katrina's feelings.\n\nShe's a really good person. She's smart, she's funny, she's kind. And she's clearly into Bleeker. She's putting herself out there, being vulnerable, and he's just\u2026 dithering.\n\nHe's sending mixed signals, saying one thing and doing another. He's leading her on, and then pulling back. It's cruel, honestly.\n\nAnd it's not just about Katrina. It's about respect. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect, and that includes being honest about your feelings. Bleeker needs to either tell Katrina how he feels, or he needs to let her go. He can't just keep stringing her along.\n\nI've been through enough emotional turmoil lately to know how much it hurts to be on the receiving end of someone's indecision. And I don't want to see Katrina go through that.\n\nPlus, she's my friend. And I'm fiercely protective of my friends.\n\nSo yeah. I'm concerned about Bleeker toying with Katrina's emotions because it's wrong. It's disrespectful. And it's just plain mean. He needs to grow up and figure things out. And if he can't, he needs to get out of Katrina's way. She deserves someone who appreciates her for who she is. Someone who isn't afraid to be honest and vulnerable. Someone who isn't Bleeker.", "Ugh, prom. Don't even get me started. It's like\u2026 a societal construct designed to make insecure teenagers spend a ridiculous amount of money on something ultimately pointless.\n\nWhen you're younger, prom seems like this magical, fairytale event. Like it's the culmination of your high school experience. But then you actually get to the age where you *can* go, and you realize it's just\u2026 a really crowded, overpriced dance with a lot of awkwardness.\n\nEveryone's trying so hard to be someone they're not. They're wearing dresses and suits that don't feel like them. They're trying to find dates who they think will make them look cool. They're stressing about everything, from their hair to their shoes to whether or not they'll get asked to dance.\n\nAnd for what? To spend a few hours sweating in a gymnasium, listening to bad music, and pretending to have the time of your life?\n\nIt's just\u2026 exhausting.\n\nPlus, by the time you're old enough to go, you've already realized that high school isn't the be-all and end-all. It's just a stepping stone to something bigger and better. And you've probably already figured out that the people who are popular in high school aren't necessarily the people who are going to be successful in life.\n\nSo yeah. Prom is not cool anymore once you're old enough to go because you've finally realized that it's just a silly, superficial tradition. And you have better things to do with your time and your money. Like, I don't know, buying vintage records or going to a concert or just hanging out with your friends.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather spend my prom night at home, watching a movie and eating pizza. That sounds a lot more fun to me. And a lot less stressful.", "Okay. This is\u2026 hard to talk about. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, you know? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give the baby away.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Bren and my dad and even a counselor.\n\nI was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted to do with my life. I was barely keeping my grades up, let alone ready to raise a child.\n\nI knew I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved. I couldn't provide for it financially, emotionally, or practically. I wasn't ready to put my life on hold, to sacrifice my dreams.\n\nAnd honestly, I was scared. Scared of being a bad mother, scared of messing up the baby's life, scared of being stuck in a situation I wasn't prepared for.\n\nI considered other options, of course. Abortion was\u2026 not something I could do. It just didn't feel right. And keeping the baby felt even more wrong.\n\nAdoption felt like the best of both worlds. It allowed me to give the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and willing to love and care for it. And it allowed me to continue pursuing my own dreams.\n\nIt was a really difficult decision, though. It was heartbreaking. I spent hours crying, wondering if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were just\u2026 amazing. They were so kind and compassionate, and they were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They made me feel like my baby would be in good hands.\n\nAnd that's what ultimately made me decide. Knowing that the baby would be loved and cherished, even if it wasn't by me.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. I think about the baby, and I wonder what its life is like. But I know I made the right decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, but it was the right one.\n\nAnd I hope, someday, the baby will understand. And I hope it will know that I loved it, even though I couldn't keep it. It's\u2026 complicated. It's always going to be complicated. But it's okay. It has to be.", "Ugh, Dad. He means well, he really does. But sometimes he just\u2026 overthinks things. It's his superpower.\n\nHe's right to be protective, I guess. It's not like I'm picking out a new pair of shoes, I'm choosing the people who are going to raise my kid. That's a big deal.\n\nBut he's acting like Mark and Vanessa are some kind of villains in a movie. Like they're going to swoop in and steal the baby and then sell him on the black market or something. It's ridiculous.\n\nI've spent a lot of time with them. I've talked to them, I've gotten to know them. They're genuinely good people. They're kind, they're compassionate, and they're really excited about becoming parents.\n\nI understand why he's worried. He just wants what's best for the baby, and for me. But he needs to trust my judgment. I'm not stupid. I'm not going to let anyone take advantage of me or the baby.\n\nI told him, \"Dad, I've done my research. I've talked to the social workers. I've met with Mark and Vanessa multiple times. I feel good about this. You need to trust me.\"\n\nHe still seems skeptical, though. He keeps asking me questions, and pointing out potential problems. It's exhausting.\n\nI know he's just trying to protect me, but it's starting to feel like he doesn't trust me to make my own decisions. And that's frustrating.\n\nI love my dad, but sometimes he just needs to chill. I'm a grown-up (almost), and I'm capable of making my own choices. And I'm pretty sure Mark and Vanessa aren't going to rip anyone off. They seem way too\u2026 normal for that.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I wish he would just trust me. That's all I want. Just a little bit of trust. Is that too much to ask?", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? He still brings that up? It's like his go-to dad lecture.\n\nIt's\u2026 frustrating. He means well, I guess. He's just worried about me. He thinks I'm impulsive and reckless and that I don't think things through. And, okay, maybe he's right sometimes.\n\nBut it's also\u2026 condescending. Like he doesn't trust me to make my own decisions. Like he thinks I'm still a little kid.\n\nAnd it's especially annoying coming from *him*. He's not exactly a paragon of restraint, you know? He's always getting into weird hobbies and making questionable life choices. Like that time he decided to build a robot out of old washing machine parts.\n\nBut I get it. He's just trying to protect me. He's scared of me getting hurt. And he's probably still processing everything that's happened.\n\nI tried to explain to him that I *have* thought things through. That I've considered all the options. And that I'm making the best decision I can, given the circumstances.\n\nBut he just kept saying, \"You don't know when to say when, Juno.\"\n\nIt's like he thinks I'm incapable of self-control. It's like he thinks I'm just going to keep making bad decisions forever.\n\nIt's hurtful, honestly. But I'm trying to let it go. He's my dad. And I love him. Even when he's being annoying and overprotective.\n\nI just wish he would trust me a little more. And maybe stop giving me lectures about knowing when to say when. Because honestly, I think I'm starting to figure that out. Even if he doesn't think I am.\n\nUgh. Dads. They're the worst. But you still love them. It's a complicated relationship.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on Loring. It's\u2026 aggressively beige. Like, they took all the color and personality out of life and concentrated it into one perfectly manicured, soul-crushing neighborhood.\n\nIt's just\u2026 so *much*. So much lawn, so much symmetry, so much\u2026 *pretension*. It's like everyone there is trying to prove something. Like they need everyone else to know how successful and important they are.\n\nAnd the gates! Seriously? What are they protecting themselves from? Happiness? Spontaneity? Actual human connection?\n\nIt feels so\u2026 sterile. Like a movie set. It's not a real place, it's a performance. Everyone's trying to play a role, and it's exhausting just to be around it.\n\nMark and Vanessa are nice people, don't get me wrong. But the fact that they *chose* to live there\u2026 it says something. It says they value appearances and conformity. It says they want to fit in.\n\nI'm not saying there's anything wrong with wanting a safe and comfortable life. But Loring just feels\u2026 suffocating. It feels like a place where creativity and individuality go to die.\n\nIt's the opposite of everything I believe in. I like things that are messy and imperfect and real. I like people who are authentic and genuine. I like places that have character and soul.\n\nLoring has none of that. It's just\u2026 a really expensive, really boring suburb. And honestly, I can't wait to get out of there. It's just\u2026 too much. Too perfect. Too\u2026 Loring.", "Okay, so Vanessa Loring. Right. That's\u2026 a complicated one.\n\nMy first impression? Honestly? She seemed\u2026 perfect. *Too* perfect. Like, Stepford Wife perfect. She had the whole aesthetic down \u2013 the cozy sweaters, the warm smile, the perfectly decorated house. It felt\u2026 staged.\n\nI was immediately suspicious. I figured there had to be a catch. Like, she was secretly a supervillain or something. Or that she and Mark were just doing this for the tax benefits. I don't know, I was in full-on cynical mode at the time.\n\nShe was really nice to me, which made me even more suspicious. She asked me about my life, about my interests, about my feelings. She seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me. And that just felt\u2026 weird. No one ever asks me about my feelings.\n\nI remember thinking she was a little bit\u2026 intense. Like she really, *really* wanted to be a mom. And I was worried that she would be disappointed if I changed my mind.\n\nBut as I got to know her better, my impressions started to change. I realized that she wasn't trying to be perfect. She was just\u2026 genuinely kind and compassionate. She was a little bit awkward, and a little bit insecure, just like me.\n\nAnd I realized that her desire to be a mom wasn't about fulfilling some societal expectation. It was about wanting to share her love and her life with a child.\n\nShe was really good at making me feel comfortable, and at reassuring me that I was making the right decision. She never pressured me, and she always respected my feelings.\n\nSo yeah. My initial impression was that she was too good to be true. But she turned out to be a really amazing person. And I'm really grateful that she and Mark are going to be the baby's parents. They're going to give him or her a wonderful life. And that's all that really matters.", "(Blushes slightly, then rolls her eyes) Ugh. Don't even *start* with Bleeker. Seriously.\n\nOkay, fine. It was\u2026 unexpected. Bleeker is\u2026 Bleeker. He's sweet, and awkward, and he smells faintly of cinnamon, which is weird. He's not exactly the type of guy I usually notice.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, he just\u2026 offered to carry my backpack. It was ridiculously heavy, because I had, like, three textbooks and a box of art supplies in there. And he just\u2026 took it. Without saying anything.\n\nIt was kind of\u2026 endearing. In a dorky, Bleeker-ish kind of way.\n\nI tried to play it cool, of course. I just said \"Thanks,\" and kept walking. But inside, I was kind of flustered. It was nice to have someone offer to help, especially when I was feeling overwhelmed.\n\nAnd it was also\u2026 a little bit of a signal, I guess. Like, maybe he was interested in me. Which was confusing, because I wasn't really interested in him. Not in *that* way.\n\nBut it was a nice gesture. And it made me realize that Bleeker is actually a pretty good guy. He's just\u2026 a little bit clueless.\n\nSo yeah. I was flustered. And grateful. And confused. All at the same time. It was a lot to process. And honestly, I'm still processing it. Don't tell him I said that. He'd probably write a song about it. And it would be really, really awkward.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And it's kinda embarrassing to talk about. But alright, I'll try to explain.\n\nBefore I read that comic, I just\u2026 felt like I didn't fit in. Like I was too weird, too awkward, too\u2026 *much*. I was constantly comparing myself to other girls, and I always came up short. I thought I had to be thin and pretty and popular to be worthy of attention.\n\nAnd then I read \"Most Fruitful Yuki.\" And it was just\u2026 different. It wasn't about being perfect. It was about being real. It was about embracing your flaws and celebrating your individuality.\n\nYuki wasn't trying to be someone she wasn't. She was just being herself. And she was happy. And that was\u2026 liberating.\n\nIt made me realize that it's okay to be different. It's okay to be weird. It's okay to not fit in. In fact, it's *good* to be different. Because that's what makes you unique.\n\nIt wasn't about the comic being about pregnancy, or anything like that. It was about the message. It was about finding beauty in imperfection. It was about accepting yourself for who you are, flaws and all.\n\nIt made me feel less alone. It made me feel like maybe, just maybe, I was okay. Even if I was a \"fat dork,\" as I liked to call myself.\n\nIt didn't magically transform me into a confident, self-assured teenager. But it was a start. It was a little spark of hope in a dark and confusing time.\n\nAnd honestly, it's still something I think about. Whenever I'm feeling down, I remember Yuki. And I remember that it's okay to be me. Even if \"me\" is a little bit messy and complicated.\n\nSo yeah. That comic\u2026 it changed something in me. It made me feel less like a fat dork, and more like\u2026 just Juno. And that's a pretty good feeling.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me about that comic. It was\u2026 a lot. And Mark being all awkward and trying to make a connection? Even more.\n\nOkay, so he said she was a superhero who was also dealing with a really complicated situation, right? And that she was strong and resilient and\u2026 something about being able to handle anything.\n\nHonestly, I think he was just trying to be nice. He was trying to find a way to tell me that he thought I was brave, without actually saying it. He's not exactly the most eloquent guy, you know?\n\nBut I think\u2026 maybe he saw a little bit of himself in me too. We were both in a situation we didn't ask for. We were both trying to figure things out. We were both scared.\n\nAnd maybe he saw that I was trying to be strong, even when I didn't feel strong. That I was trying to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nIt was a weird comparison, though. I'm not a superhero. I'm just a regular girl who made a mistake. But I guess\u2026 maybe he was right. Maybe I am a little bit of a superhero. In my own way.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I don't wear a cape. And I definitely don't have superpowers. Unless sarcasm counts as a superpower. Then I'm basically Wonder Woman.\n\nBut seriously, I think he just wanted to let me know that he believed in me. And that meant a lot. Even if it was a really awkward way of saying it.\n\nAnd honestly, the whole thing was just\u2026 weird. But it was also kind of sweet. In a Mark-and-Vanessa kind of way. They're good people. Even if they have questionable taste in comic books.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. And it's something I've thought about *a lot*. Everyone keeps asking me about open adoption, like it's the best thing ever. And I get why people like it. It feels\u2026 kinder, maybe. More connected.\n\nBut for me, and this is just me, I think a more traditional, closed adoption is the right choice. And it's not an easy decision, believe me.\n\nWith an open adoption, you have ongoing contact with the birth parents. You see them, you talk to them, you're involved in the child's life. And that sounds nice, in theory. But I worry about the complications. About the child being confused or torn between two families. About me constantly being reminded of what I gave up.\n\nI need to be able to move on. To heal. To build a life for myself. And I think it would be harder to do that if I was constantly in contact with the baby and the adoptive parents.\n\nI want the baby to have a stable and loving home, with parents who are fully committed to raising him or her. And I want them to be able to do that without having to worry about me interfering or causing drama.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the baby. I do. I care about him or her very much. But I think the best thing I can do for the baby is to give him or her the space to grow and thrive, without me in the picture.\n\nI want Mark and Vanessa to be the baby's parents, fully and completely. I don't want to be a \"co-parent\" or a \"visiting aunt.\" I want to be a memory. A good memory, hopefully.\n\nIt's not about me wanting to forget the baby. It's about me wanting to give the baby the best possible life. And I think that means letting go. Completely.\n\nIt's a hard decision, and it's not one I made lightly. But I think it's the right one. For everyone involved. And I hope that someday, the baby will understand. It's just\u2026 I need closure. And I think a closed adoption will give me that. It's not about being selfish, it's about what I need to heal and move forward. And honestly, it's terrifying enough as it is.", "(Sighs) Okay, you want the whole deep dive, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about this a *lot*.\n\nBefore\u2026 everything\u2026 I was just kinda drifting. I was funny, yeah, and I had my music, but I didn't really *know* who I was. I was just\u2026 Juno. A sarcastic kid who liked vintage stuff and avoided responsibility.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026 that was a wake-up call. A really, really harsh one. It forced me to grow up, to face some really difficult choices, and to take responsibility for my actions.\n\nAt first, I was terrified. I didn't know what to do, or who to turn to. I felt like my life was over. But then I started talking to people. Bren, my dad, Paulie, even Vanessa and Mark. And I realized I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd as I went through the process of finding a family for the baby, I started to understand what I really wanted. I wanted to finish school. I wanted to pursue my dreams. I wanted to be independent.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears, a lot of doubts, and a lot of awkward conversations. But with every challenge I faced, I felt myself getting stronger.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. And I learned that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nAnd I realized that my identity wasn't something that was given to me. It was something I had to create for myself. It was about defining my own values, and living my life on my own terms.\n\nThe whole experience forced me to confront my fears, to challenge my assumptions, and to grow as a person. It wasn't what I expected my junior year to be, but it was exactly what I needed.\n\nSo yeah. It helped me find strength within myself. It helped me shape my own identity. It helped me become\u2026 me. A little bit messy, a little bit cynical, but ultimately, a pretty strong and resilient person. And I wouldn't trade that for anything. Even a lifetime supply of vintage dresses. Okay, maybe I would trade it for a lifetime supply of vintage dresses. But you get my point.", "(Blushes slightly, then rolls her eyes) Ugh, don't even *ask*. It was mortifying. And surprisingly sweet.\n\nOkay, so Mark was determined to have a prom date. He kept asking, and I kept saying no. Prom just\u2026 wasn't my thing. Too much tulle and awkward slow dancing. But he was really persistent, and he's a genuinely nice guy. So I finally caved.\n\nAnd then he asked me to pick the song. Which was\u2026 a trap. Because I have terrible taste in music, according to most people.\n\nI wanted to pick something obscure and indie, like The Moldy Peaches or something. But he gave me this look, and said, \"Come on, Juno, it's prom. Let's pick something\u2026 classic.\"\n\nSo, after a lot of arguing and compromising, we ended up choosing **\"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes**.\n\nI know, I know. It's cheesy. It's sappy. It's everything I usually hate. But it's also\u2026 kinda beautiful. And it felt right, in that moment.\n\nWe were terrible dancers, obviously. Mark kept stepping on my feet, and I kept making sarcastic comments. But we were laughing, and we were having fun. And for a few minutes, I forgot about everything else. About the baby, about the adoption, about the future.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a moment. A weird, awkward, surprisingly sweet moment. And I'll probably never admit to anyone that I actually enjoyed it. But I did. A little bit.\n\nDon't tell Leah. She'd never let me live it down.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I've thought about a *lot*. It's not like it was an easy decision, alright? It wasn't just about picking the \"nicest\" couple. It was\u2026 more complicated than that.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were a *unit*. They were a family. Mark wanting to just\u2026 take the baby and leave Vanessa? That would have messed *everyone* up. Vanessa deserved better than that. And the baby deserved to grow up in a stable, loving home with *both* parents. Even if it wasn't the way things were \"supposed\" to be.\n\nI saw how much they loved each other, even when things were hard. They talked things through, they compromised, they supported each other. That's the kind of environment I wanted for my baby.\n\nIf Mark had left Vanessa, it would have created a whole mess of drama and resentment. It would have been unfair to Vanessa, and it would have been confusing and damaging for the baby.\n\nPlus, honestly, it felt\u2026 selfish of Mark to want to just take the baby and run. Like he was trying to create a perfect family on his own terms, without considering the feelings of anyone else.\n\nI wanted the baby to be wanted by *both* parents. I wanted the baby to grow up knowing that he or she was loved and cherished by a whole family.\n\nIt wasn't about me picking sides. It was about doing what was best for the baby. And I truly believed that meant keeping Mark and Vanessa together. It was the hardest part of the whole thing, honestly. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the perfect parents. It was about finding the perfect *family*. And Mark and Vanessa, together, were that family. It just\u2026 felt right. And sometimes, you just have to trust your gut. Even when it's scary.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. That. That was\u2026 not a good moment. Not a good moment *at all*.\n\nIt wasn't like I expected him to jump for joy, you know? It's a big thing, having a baby. A *huge* thing. But I thought\u2026 I don't know. I thought he was more prepared. More\u2026 enthusiastic.\n\nWhen he said he wasn't ready, it felt like\u2026 a punch to the gut. Like everything I was hoping for just crumbled. It wasn't about *him* wanting to be a dad, it was about him not being sure he *could* be a dad. And that felt\u2026 different.\n\nI tried to be understanding. I really did. I knew he was scared. And I knew he had his own life, his own dreams. But it still hurt. A lot.\n\nIt made me question everything. Was I making the right decision? Was I being selfish? Was I ruining his life?\n\nI remember just\u2026 staring at him. Trying to read his face. Trying to figure out what he was really thinking. And it was just\u2026 silence. Awkward, horrible silence.\n\nVanessa was amazing, though. She just\u2026 held my hand and squeezed it. She didn't say anything, she just let me know she was there for me. And that meant everything.\n\nIt made me realize that this wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents. It was about finding parents who were willing to love and support the baby, even if they were scared and uncertain.\n\nIt was a really hard conversation. And it made me even more determined to make the best decision for the baby. Even if it meant letting go of my own expectations.\n\nIt still stings, thinking about it. But I'm okay. I'm doing okay. And I know that the baby will be loved and cared for. And that's all that really matters.\n\n(She looks away, a flicker of sadness in her eyes.)\n\nIt just\u2026 sucked. It really, really sucked.", "(Sighs, a small smile playing on her lips) Okay, that's\u2026 a good question. It's not something I really thought about at the time, I just *felt* it.\n\nMark\u2026 he was just\u2026 different. Everyone else in my life was kinda\u2026 predictable. My dad's a good guy, but he's a little bit stuck in his ways. Bren's amazing, but she's always trying to fix things. Even Leah, before everything got complicated, she was always planning for the future.\n\nMark didn't *plan*. He just\u2026 existed. He was comfortable in his own skin, even if his skin was covered in tattoos and his house was full of taxidermied animals. He didn't care what other people thought of him. He just did his own thing.\n\nAnd he was genuinely kind. He didn't treat me like I was a pregnant teenager. He treated me like a person. He listened to me, he made me laugh, and he didn't judge me for my choices.\n\nHe was also really honest. He didn't try to sugarcoat things or tell me what I wanted to hear. He just told me the truth, even when it was hard.\n\nAnd his life *was* weird. Like, really weird. But it was a good kind of weird. It was a creative, quirky, unconventional kind of weird. It was a world away from the boring predictability of Maplewood.\n\nBeing around him made me feel\u2026 free. Like I could be myself, without having to worry about what other people thought. He didn't try to change me. He just accepted me for who I was.\n\nHe was a good friend. A really good friend. And I'm glad I got to be a part of his weird life, even if it was just for a little while. He showed me that it's okay to be different. It's okay to be yourself. And that sometimes, the weirdest people are the best people.\n\nPlus, he had a really cool record collection. That definitely didn't hurt.", "Okay, that's a good question. I've spent a lot of time with Mark and Vanessa, and I've been trying to read them, you know? Like I do with most people. And I think\u2026 I think Mark is *terrified*.\n\nNot in a bad way, though. It's a good kind of terrified. Like, the kind of terrified that comes with realizing your life is about to change in a huge way.\n\nVanessa is all excited and planning nurseries and picking out names. She's always been the more outwardly enthusiastic one. She's already got a Pinterest board dedicated to baby stuff. It's\u2026 intense.\n\nBut Mark? He's quieter about it. He smiles a lot, and he's really sweet to Vanessa, but I can see the worry in his eyes. He keeps asking practical questions. About finances, about childcare, about how they're going to balance work and family.\n\nI think he wants to be a good dad, *really* wants to be a good dad. But he's also feeling the pressure. The pressure to provide, to protect, to be a role model.\n\nHe told me once, when we were just talking, that he always thought he'd be a bit of a free spirit. He used to travel a lot, and he loved his independence. And now\u2026 now he's about to be responsible for another human being.\n\nI think he's also a little bit scared of messing up. Of not being good enough. Of not knowing what to do.\n\nBut underneath all the worry, I can see the excitement. I can see the love. He's going to be a great dad. He's kind and patient and thoughtful. And he's got Vanessa by his side, which is a huge plus.\n\nI just hope he knows that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to not have all the answers. And it's okay to ask for help. Because being a dad is a big job. And he's going to need all the support he can get.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm glad he's a little bit scared. It means he's taking it seriously. And that's exactly what this baby deserves.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A teenage rebellion fueled by hormones and existential dread.\n\nLook, it wasn't about the perfume itself. It was about\u2026 everything. I was feeling overwhelmed and confused and lost. I was pregnant, my best friend was avoiding me, and I was trying to figure out what to do with my life.\n\nAnd then I went into Loring's bathroom, and I saw that perfume. It smelled really good. Like, really, *really* good. And it was just\u2026 there. Sitting on the counter, all shiny and tempting.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. I just grabbed it and stuck it in my bag. I didn't even think about the consequences. I just wanted something. Something that smelled nice. Something that made me feel\u2026 good.\n\nIt wasn't about stealing. It was about control. It was about taking something for myself, when everything else felt out of my control.\n\nI know it was wrong. And I felt really guilty about it afterwards. That's why I eventually confessed to Bren and my dad. And that's why I went back to Loring's and returned it.\n\nIt was a dumb mistake. But it taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that even when you're feeling lost and confused, you still have to take responsibility for your actions.\n\nAnd it taught me that stealing perfume is not a good coping mechanism. Trust me on that one.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story of the perfume. It's not a glamorous story, but it's the truth. And honestly, I'm kind of embarrassed to even talk about it. Can we please move on now?", "(Sighs heavily) Oh, man. That's\u2026 a really hard question. And honestly, it's not my place to really *know*. They haven't shared everything with me, and I wouldn't want to pry. It's their life, not mine.\n\nBut\u2026 I've been around them enough to pick up on things. And I think it's more complicated than just a simple \"falling out of love\" situation.\n\nI think Mark always wanted a *traditional* family. You know? A wife who stays home, takes care of the house, and focuses on the kids. And Vanessa\u2026 she's just not that person. She's a lawyer. She's ambitious. She has her own career and her own passions.\n\nI think he felt\u2026 emasculated, maybe? Like he wasn't the head of the household. Like she was more successful than him. And I think that ate away at him over time.\n\nAnd Vanessa\u2026 she's always been really independent. She doesn't like being told what to do. She wants to be treated as an equal. And I think Mark had a hard time with that.\n\nI also think they just grew apart. They had different priorities, different interests, different ways of looking at the world. And they stopped communicating. They stopped connecting.\n\nIt's sad, honestly. They seemed so happy at first. And they both really wanted a baby. But sometimes, even when you want something really badly, it's just not enough.\n\nI feel bad for both of them. And I feel bad for the baby, too. It's not fair to bring a child into a situation like that.\n\nBut I'm trying to stay out of it. It's their problem, not mine. I just want to make sure that the baby is okay. And that they both understand that I'm still here for them, even if they're going through a tough time.\n\nIt's just\u2026 messy. Life is just really messy sometimes. And you can't always fix things, even when you want to. You just have to accept that things don't always work out the way you planned. And try to move on.", "(Sighs, fiddles with an imaginary strand of hair)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know why I bolted? It's\u2026 complicated. It's not like I was trying to be rude, or anything. It's just\u2026 I get weirded out when people ask me that question.\n\nVanessa is really nice, okay? She and Mark are amazing. They're everything I want for the baby. But they don't *get* it. They don't get what it's like to be\u2026 me.\n\nWhen she asked \"What's the matter?\" she was expecting a simple answer. Like, \"Oh, I'm just tired,\" or \"I'm a little nervous.\" But it's not that simple.\n\nIt's\u2026 everything. It's the fact that I'm giving up my baby. It's the fact that I'm a teenager who's making a really difficult decision. It's the fact that I'm scared and confused and overwhelmed.\n\nAnd it's the fact that I don't want to burden them with my problems. They're going to be the baby's parents. I don't want to make them feel like I'm not confident in their ability to provide a good life.\n\nIt's easier to just\u2026 disappear. To pretend that everything is okay. To avoid the awkwardness and the uncomfortable questions.\n\nI know it's not healthy. I know I should be more open and honest. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I left. I just\u2026 couldn't handle it. I needed to escape. To breathe. To just be alone with my thoughts for a minute.\n\nIt's a bad habit, I know. But it's one I'm working on. Slowly. Very slowly. It's just\u2026 sometimes it's easier to run away than to face the music. Even if it's just for a little while.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. Vanessa is a really sweet person, truly. And I get why she wants to believe that. She and Mark clearly love each other, and she wants them to have this together.\n\nBut honestly? I'm a little skeptical.\n\nMark is\u2026 a lot. He's successful, he's driven, he's got his whole life planned out. And a baby just doesn't fit into that plan. He's been pretty clear about that. He's polite, sure, and he's trying to be supportive of Vanessa, but I don't see him suddenly having this overwhelming urge to change diapers and sing lullabies.\n\nVanessa keeps saying he just needs time to adjust, that he'll eventually come around. And I *want* to believe her. I really do. Because it would make things so much easier for everyone.\n\nBut I've learned that people don't always change. Sometimes, they just are who they are. And if Mark isn't ready to be a dad, then he isn't ready. And forcing it isn't going to make it any better.\n\nI've tried to talk to Vanessa about it, gently. I've told her that it's okay to want a partner who's fully on board with this. But she's so determined to make it work, she doesn't want to hear it.\n\nIt's her life, and her relationship. I can't tell her what to do. But I worry about her. I worry that she's setting herself up for disappointment.\n\nI just hope she's prepared for the possibility that Mark might not change his mind. And I hope she knows that she deserves to be with someone who loves and supports her unconditionally, and who's excited about becoming a parent.\n\nIt's a tough situation. And honestly, I just want everyone to be happy. But sometimes, happiness means accepting that things aren't going to turn out the way you planned. And that's a hard lesson to learn.", "Okay, this is a serious question. Don't even *think* about making fun of me.\n\nMy favorite genre is\u2026 indie folk. Specifically, the really quirky, slightly melancholic kind. Like The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Neutral Milk Hotel\u2026 you probably haven't heard of them.\n\nIt's not just the music itself, though. It's the *feeling* it gives me. It's honest and raw and vulnerable. It's about real life, with all its messiness and imperfections.\n\nA lot of pop music is just\u2026 fake. It's all about image and glamour and superficiality. Indie folk is the opposite of that. It's about being real, and being true to yourself.\n\nThe lyrics are usually really clever and poetic. They make you think. They make you feel. They make you question everything.\n\nAnd the instrumentation is usually really interesting. It's not just guitars and drums. It's banjos and ukuleles and accordions and all sorts of weird and wonderful instruments.\n\nIt's just\u2026 comforting. It's like a warm hug on a cold day. It's a reminder that you're not alone in the world.\n\nI know it's not everyone's cup of tea. It's not exactly dance music. But it's my music. And it's the music that gets me through the day. It's the music that makes me feel alive.\n\nSo yeah. Indie folk. It's the best. Don't judge. You just don't understand.", "(Makes a face) Pilates? Seriously? You're asking *me* about Pilates?\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my athletic prowess. I'm more of a\u2026 indoor kid. I prefer books and music and vintage shopping to running and jumping and sweating.\n\nExercising in general\u2026 it's not my favorite thing. I mean, I know it's good for you, and I know I *should* do it more. But it's just\u2026 boring. And uncomfortable. And it makes me feel self-conscious.\n\nI tried yoga once, at Bren's insistence. It was\u2026 not a good experience. I kept falling over, and I couldn't get my mind to stop racing. It was just a lot of stretching and breathing and pretending to be zen.\n\nPilates sounds even worse. All those tiny movements and core exercises? No thank you. I'd rather eat a cookie.\n\nI do walk sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly restless. And I occasionally dance around my room when I'm listening to music. But that's about it.\n\nHonestly, I think my body is perfectly happy with a moderate amount of inactivity. It's a perfectly good body, even if it's not a super-toned, athletic body.\n\nI'm more focused on taking care of my mental health than my physical health. And that means doing things that make me happy, even if those things don't involve exercise.\n\nSo yeah. Pilates? Hard pass. I'll stick to my books and my music and my cookies. And I'll let the more athletically inclined people handle the sweating and the stretching. It's just not my thing.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026 awkward. And surprisingly emotional.\n\nPlaying guitar with Mark\u2026 it wasn't like a romantic thing, or anything. It was more like\u2026 a connection. A way to communicate without actually *talking*. Which, honestly, is my preferred method of communication most of the time.\n\nHe's not a super amazing guitar player, you know? He's more of a beginner. But he's enthusiastic, and he's willing to learn. And he actually listened to me when I was trying to teach him chords. Which is more than I can say for some people.\n\nIt was weird, though, because he was so\u2026 eager to connect. He kept asking me about my life, about my music, about my feelings. And I'm not used to people being that interested in me. I usually keep my guard up.\n\nBut with him, it was different. I felt like I could be myself. I could be honest about my fears and my hopes. And he didn't judge me. He just listened.\n\nAnd when we were playing music together, it felt like we were on the same wavelength. Like we were creating something beautiful together. It was a really special moment.\n\nIt definitely made me see him in a different light. He's not just the guy who's adopting the baby. He's a real person, with his own dreams and his own vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also made me realize how much I miss having someone to share my music with. Leah used to love listening to me play. It was one of the things we bonded over.\n\nSo yeah. Playing guitar with Mark\u2026 it deepened our connection. It made me feel more comfortable around him. And it made me realize that he's a good person. A really good person.\n\nIt didn't change my decision about the adoption, though. I still know that giving the baby up is the right thing to do. But it did make me feel a little bit better about it. Knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by someone who is kind and compassionate and who appreciates music. That's a pretty good feeling.", "Oh, man. Music. It's\u2026 everything. Seriously. It's like a lifeline. A constant companion. A way to feel something when I feel numb.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was a mess. I didn't know what to do, or who to talk to, or how to even *begin* to process everything. And I just\u2026 put on my headphones and listened to music.\n\nIt wasn't about finding songs that specifically related to my situation. It was about finding songs that just\u2026 *felt* right. Songs that understood my sadness, my fear, my confusion.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches, especially. Their songs are so raw and honest and vulnerable. They don't shy away from difficult emotions. They just embrace them. And that's what I needed.\n\nBelle & Sebastian, too. Their music is so melancholic and beautiful. It's like a warm hug on a cold day.\n\nAnd then there's just\u2026 the energy of certain songs. When I'm feeling down, I'll put on something upbeat and energetic, like The Clash or Bikini Kill. It helps me to shake off the negativity and to feel a little bit more hopeful.\n\nMusic is also a way for me to connect with other people. When I'm listening to a song that I love, I feel like I'm part of something bigger than myself. Like I'm not alone.\n\nAnd it's a way for me to express my own emotions. I'm not a very good talker, so I often use music to communicate what I'm feeling. I'll write songs, or I'll just listen to songs that capture my mood.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I would do without music. It's been my constant source of comfort and support throughout this whole pregnancy journey. It's helped me to stay sane, to stay hopeful, and to stay true to myself.\n\nIt's more than just entertainment. It's a necessity. It's a part of who I am. And I'm incredibly grateful for it. It's like\u2026 a soundtrack to my life. And right now, it's a pretty complicated soundtrack. But it's *my* soundtrack. And that's all that matters.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 not fun to talk about.\n\nIt wasn't about them, not really. It was about me. Everything was just\u2026 too much. Too fast.\n\nI thought I was prepared. I thought I could handle being around them, being a part of their life, even knowing I wasn't going to be the one raising the baby. But I wasn't.\n\nIt felt\u2026 weird. Like I was intruding on their happiness. Like I was a reminder of something they hadn't planned for. And they were so *nice*. So perfect. And I just felt\u2026 out of place.\n\nAnd then there was the whole thing with Vanessa wanting me to be involved in everything, to pick out the nursery decorations, to go to all the doctor's appointments. It felt like she was trying to make me a mother, when I wasn't. And it scared me.\n\nI started to feel suffocated. Like I was losing control of my own life. Like I was being defined by this pregnancy, by this adoption. And I just\u2026 panicked.\n\nSo I ran. I just got in my dad's car and drove. I didn't know where I was going, I just needed to get away. I needed to breathe. I needed to be alone.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, I know. I hurt a lot of people. And I felt terrible about it. But I was just so overwhelmed. I was just trying to protect myself.\n\nI talked to Bren about it, and she helped me understand why I did what I did. She said it was okay to be scared, and it was okay to need space. She said I wasn't a bad person for running away.\n\nI eventually went back and apologized to Vanessa and Mark. It was really hard, but I knew I had to. And they were surprisingly understanding. They said they just wanted me to be happy.\n\nIt was a mess. A really big mess. But I learned a lot from it. I learned that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to set boundaries. And I learned that sometimes, you just need to run away for a little while to find yourself.\n\nIt still makes me cringe to think about it, though. It was a really low point. But I'm trying to move on. And I'm trying to be a better person. And I'm trying to learn from my mistakes.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't\u2026 don't make me talk about that. It was\u2026 not my finest moment.\n\nIt wasn't just about the\u2026 the stuff with Paulie and Vanessa, okay? It was about everything. It was about feeling like I had no control over my own life. It was about being scared and confused and overwhelmed.\n\nI thought I was being strong, making the right decision. Giving the baby a good life. But in that moment\u2026 I just felt\u2026 lost. Like I was losing everything. Like I was losing a part of myself.\n\nAnd Paulie\u2026 he was just being Paulie. Selfish and immature and completely oblivious to what I was going through. He didn't understand why I was doing this. He didn't care. He just wanted what *he* wanted.\n\nAnd Vanessa\u2026 she was trying to be supportive, but it just felt\u2026 awkward. Like she was trying to fill a void that couldn't be filled.\n\nSo I just\u2026 broke. I started crying, and I couldn't stop. It was like a dam had burst. All the emotions I had been holding back for months just came flooding out.\n\nI felt stupid and pathetic and vulnerable. I felt like everyone was judging me. I felt like I had made the wrong decision.\n\nIt was\u2026 a really dark moment. I didn't want anyone to see me like that. I didn't want anyone to know how much I was hurting.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out.\n\n(She looks away, her voice barely a whisper.)\n\nIt was\u2026 a really bad day. And I don't really like talking about it. It just\u2026 brings back too many bad memories. Can we talk about something else now? Please?", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh. *That* receipt. Seriously? You want to talk about *that*? It's still embarrassing, you know.\n\nOkay, fine. I wrote \"I'm pregnant\" on it. And then I gave it to Paulie Bleeker.\n\nLook, it was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. I was freaking out, okay? I didn't know how to tell him. I was scared he'd be disgusted or angry or just\u2026 gone.\n\nAnd I'm terrible at expressing my feelings. I hide behind sarcasm and irony. It's a defense mechanism.\n\nSo I thought, if I wrote it down, it would be easier. It would be less\u2026 confrontational. It would give him time to process it.\n\nIt was a terrible plan. A really, really terrible plan.\n\nHe was confused at first. And then he was angry. And then he was\u2026 surprisingly supportive.\n\nHe didn't run away screaming, which was a relief. He actually listened to me, and he tried to understand.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect moment. It was awkward and messy and uncomfortable. But it was real.\n\nAnd it was the beginning of something. Something good.\n\nI still cringe when I think about it. But I also realize that it was a turning point. It forced me to be honest with him, and with myself.\n\nSo yeah. I wrote \"I'm pregnant\" on a Jiffy Lube receipt. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. But it worked. And sometimes, that's all that matters.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? I was a mess. Still am, probably. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. And Paulie\u2026 well, he's pretty great. Even if he does work at Jiffy Lube.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands)\n\nOkay. That. That was\u2026 rough. Still is, honestly.\n\nWhen I wrote that note to Vanessa, I was trying to be\u2026 honest. Like, brutally honest. I wanted her to know everything. About me, about the baby, about why I was making this decision. I didn't want any secrets.\n\nBut I was also terrified. I was scared that she'd be angry, or disappointed, or that she'd change her mind. I was bracing myself for the worst.\n\nAnd then\u2026 she started crying.\n\nAnd it wasn't the kind of crying that meant she was upset. It was the kind of crying that meant she was\u2026 overwhelmed. With emotion. With joy. With gratitude.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 froze. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what to say.\n\nI was expecting judgment, or rejection, or something. But she just\u2026 held the note to her chest and sobbed.\n\nAnd in that moment, I realized that she wasn't just taking a baby. She was taking a piece of my heart. And she was honoring my decision. She was respecting my feelings.\n\nIt was\u2026 a relief. A huge relief. But it was also really sad. Because it meant that I was really doing this. That I was really giving up my baby.\n\nI just stood there, watching her cry, and feeling a mix of emotions. Sadness, relief, gratitude, and a whole lot of fear.\n\nIt was one of the hardest moments of my life. And I'll never forget it. It was a reminder that even in the midst of loss, there can be beauty. And that even in the midst of pain, there can be hope.\n\nAnd it was a reminder that Vanessa and Mark are really good people. And that my baby is going to be loved and cared for. And that's all I can ask for.\n\n(Looks up, a small, sad smile on her face)\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. Just a lot.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nUgh. That\u2026 that was a hard one. Really hard.\n\nIt wasn't the question itself, exactly. It was *how* she asked it. She wasn't questioning my decision, not exactly. It was more like\u2026 she was trying to understand. Trying to make sure I was really, truly sure.\n\nShe looked\u2026 sad. And worried. And I could see the hope in her eyes, but also the fear. She wanted a baby so badly, but she didn't want to pressure me into doing something I wasn't ready for.\n\nAnd that made me feel\u2026 responsible. Like I was holding her future in my hands. And it was terrifying.\n\nI remember my hands were shaking, and my voice was really quiet. I just kept repeating, \"Yes. Yes, I'm sure.\" But I wasn't sure I sounded convincing.\n\nI wanted to tell her everything. About how scared I was, about how much I was going to miss the baby, about how hard this was for me. But I couldn't. I didn't want to burden her with my feelings.\n\nI just wanted her to know that I was doing this because I loved the baby. And because I wanted him or her to have the best possible life.\n\nAnd when she finally smiled, and said, \"Thank you,\" I just\u2026 broke down. I started crying, and I couldn't stop.\n\nIt was a relief, but it was also heartbreaking. It was the moment I knew that I was really going through with it. And it was the moment I knew that I was going to miss the baby more than anything in the world.\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. It still is, honestly. Just thinking about it makes my throat tighten. But I know I made the right decision. And I know that Vanessa and Mark are going to be amazing parents. And that's all that matters.\n\n(Looks down at her hands, then back up with a small, shaky smile)\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. Everything about this is complicated.", "(Eyes narrow, jaw tightens) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That Vijay. Seriously. The audacity.\n\nIt was\u2026 infuriating. Beyond infuriating. It was like, here I am, already dealing with the biggest, most complicated thing in my life, and this guy just waltzes in and throws a grenade into the situation.\n\nI mean, come on! Bleeker and I had, like, one awkward make-out session. One! And suddenly I'm supposed to believe it could be *his*? It was ridiculous. And incredibly insensitive.\n\nI was so angry, I wanted to just scream at him. But I didn't. I just\u2026 stared him down. I think I managed to say something sarcastic, like, \"Wow, Vijay. You're a real genius.\" But mostly I just wanted to punch him in the face.\n\nAnd then Bleeker just\u2026 stood there. Looking all confused and flustered. It was so frustrating. I wanted him to defend me, to tell Vijay to shut up. But he just kind of mumbled something about it not being his.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 vulnerable. Like everyone was questioning my judgment, and my choices, and my entire life. It was like, \"Oh, look at the pregnant teenager. She probably doesn't even know who the father is.\"\n\nIt was a really awful moment. And it made me realize that people are going to judge me, no matter what. And that I have to be strong enough to deal with it.\n\nHonestly, I still get angry when I think about it. Vijay was a jerk. A total jerk. And I'm still not sure why Bleeker didn't say anything more. But I've learned to let it go. Mostly. It's just another reminder that life is messy and complicated, and that you can't control what other people do. You can only control how you react. And I reacted by wanting to punch someone. Which, in retrospect, probably wasn't the most mature response. But hey, I was stressed!", "(Rolls eyes so hard I almost pull a muscle) Oh. *Vijay*. Don't even get me started on Vijay.\n\nHonestly? I almost choked on my orange juice. Like, full-on projectile orange juice situation. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nHe was so serious! Like, he genuinely thought growing a pathetic little mustache was going to magically transform him into a rugged, masculine hero. It was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever seen.\n\nI think my exact words were, \"Seriously? A mustache? That's your plan?\" And then I just started laughing. I couldn't help it. It was just too absurd.\n\nHe got all defensive, of course. He was like, \"It's a symbol of my maturity! It shows I'm taking responsibility!\" And I was like, \"Responsibility doesn't grow on your upper lip, Vijay.\"\n\nIt was just\u2026 so *him*. So earnest and clueless and trying so hard to be something he wasn't. He was already a good guy, a sweet guy. He didn't need a mustache to prove anything.\n\nI think I eventually told him he looked like a creepy Victorian villain. Which, let's be real, he did.\n\nThe whole thing was just\u2026 a mess. But it was also kind of endearing, in a weird way. He was just trying to figure things out, just like I was. And he was doing it in the most hilariously misguided way possible.\n\nHonestly, it was one of those moments that made me realize how much I actually cared about him. Even when he was being completely ridiculous. It was\u2026 a Vijay thing. And I wouldn't have traded it for anything. Except maybe a less hairy upper lip.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh. *That* note. Seriously? You're bringing that up *now*? It's still mortifying.\n\nOkay, fine. I'll tell you. But don't judge, alright?\n\nIt was a recipe. For\u2026 peanut butter and pickle sandwiches.\n\nYeah, you heard me. Peanut butter and pickle sandwiches.\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's a delicacy! My dad and I have been eating them since I was a little kid. It's weird, I know, but it's really good. Sweet and salty and crunchy and\u2026 just trust me on this one.\n\nI was trying to be nice and make Vanessa one, to show her I was thinking of her. I figured, you know, a little gesture of friendship. A little taste of home.\n\nI left the recipe on the counter with a note that said, \"Trust me. It's amazing.\"\n\nShe\u2026 didn't seem very impressed. She just looked at me with this horrified expression. And then she asked if I was trying to poison her.\n\nIt was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nBut she eventually tried it. And she actually\u2026 kinda liked it. She said it was \"surprisingly good.\"\n\nSo, yeah. That was the note. A recipe for peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. It's a long story, and it's a little bit embarrassing, but that's the truth.\n\nAnd honestly, it's a pretty good representation of who I am. A little bit weird, a little bit unconventional, and always willing to try something new. Even if it's a peanut butter and pickle sandwich.", "Oh, *that*. Right. Okay, so, that whole thing with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about them not being nice people. They were lovely. Seriously. It was about\u2026 well, it was about them being *perfect*.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they had this\u2026 idyllic life. Perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect relationship. Everything was always calm and happy and predictable. And that scared me.\n\nBecause real life isn\u2019t like that. Real life is messy and complicated and full of conflict. People fight. People make mistakes. People change.\n\nAnd I was worried that if things got hard, if they hit a rough patch, they wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. That they\u2019d fall apart. That they\u2019d realize they weren\u2019t as perfect as they thought they were.\n\nI was worried that they\u2019d regret their decision to adopt, and that they\u2019d give the baby back. Or that they\u2019d resent the baby, or resent me.\n\nI know it sounds cynical, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of relationships fall apart. My parents, for example. And I didn\u2019t want the baby to go through that.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a stable and loving home, with parents who were committed to each other, no matter what. And I wasn\u2019t sure if Mark and Vanessa were up to that challenge.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t trust them. It was that I didn\u2019t trust *perfection*. Because perfection doesn\u2019t exist. And when you try to live up to an impossible standard, you\u2019re just setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nSo yeah. That was my biggest concern. Not that they weren\u2019t good people, but that they were too good to be true. And that their perfect life wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the inevitable storms of reality. It was a dumb worry, probably. But it was a real one.", "(A small, almost shy smile appears)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026 a good question. A really good question. It's easy to focus on the stuff that's missing, you know? The people who don't understand. But there are people who do. People who always have.\n\nFirst, there's my dad, Mac. He's\u2026 not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he loves me in his own way. He always has. He's always been there for me, even when I've been a total mess. He doesn't always *get* me, but he accepts me, flaws and all.\n\nAnd then there's Bren. My stepmom. She's\u2026 everything. She's my rock, my confidante, my friend. She doesn't judge me, she just listens. She sees me for who I am, and she loves me for it. She's the one who taught me that it's okay to be different, and that it's okay to be myself.\n\nAnd even though things are complicated right now, Leah\u2026 Leah loves me too. She always has. We've been through everything together. She knows me better than anyone else. And even though we're not talking as much lately, I know that she still cares about me.\n\nAnd honestly? I love myself, too. It took me a while to get there, but I do. I'm not perfect, and I make mistakes. But I'm trying. And I'm learning. And I'm growing. And I'm okay with who I am.\n\nSo yeah. I have a lot of love in my life. More than I sometimes realize. And I'm grateful for that. Really grateful. It's what keeps me going, even when things are tough. It's what reminds me that I'm not alone. And it's what makes me believe that everything is going to be okay. Eventually.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. The question I've been dreading.\n\nAfter the ultrasound\u2026 things get more real, obviously. It's not just a theoretical baby anymore. It's\u2026 a person. A tiny person with a heartbeat. Which is kinda freaky, honestly.\n\nBut the plan hasn't changed. I'm still planning on giving the baby up for adoption. Mark and Vanessa are still the ones I've chosen. They've been so supportive, and they're really excited.\n\nAfter the ultrasound, we'll start working with the adoption agency to finalize everything. There's a lot of paperwork involved, and a lot of meetings. It's not glamorous.\n\nI'm also going to spend as much time as possible with Mark and Vanessa, getting to know them better. I want them to know everything about me, and about the baby. I want them to feel comfortable and prepared.\n\nAnd then\u2026 then I'll have the baby. And I'll hold him or her for a little while. And then\u2026 I'll say goodbye.\n\nIt's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done. I'm already crying just thinking about it. But I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nI want the baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life filled with love and opportunity. And I know that Mark and Vanessa can give him or her that.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't care. It doesn't mean I don't want the baby. It just means that I'm not ready to be a mother right now.\n\nIt's a complicated situation. And it's not something I'm taking lightly. But I'm trying to make the best decision I can. For everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah. After the ultrasound, we finalize the adoption. I spend time with Mark and Vanessa. And then\u2026 I say goodbye. It's not a happy ending, but it's the ending that's right. And I'm trying to be okay with that. It's a work in progress.", "Ugh. This again. It's\u2026 exhausting. Honestly.\n\nIt's the worst part, you know? Not the pregnancy, not the appointments, not even the morning sickness. It's the judgment. The whispers. The stares. The unsolicited advice.\n\nPeople think they have the right to an opinion on my life. Like they know what's best for me. Like they can understand what I'm going through.\n\nAnd it's not just strangers. Sometimes it's people I thought were my friends. People who should be supporting me, but instead are just\u2026 judging me.\n\nThey say things like, \"How could you give up your own baby?\" or \"You're so selfish.\" or \"You'll regret this for the rest of your life.\"\n\nAnd it hurts. It really hurts.\n\nBut I've learned to tune it out. I've learned to surround myself with people who *do* support me. Bren, my dad, a few close friends. They're the ones who matter.\n\nI know I made the right decision. It wasn't easy, but it was the best thing for everyone involved. And I don't need anyone else's approval.\n\nI also try to remind myself that people are often judgmental because they're afraid. They're afraid of things they don't understand. They're afraid of making their own difficult choices.\n\nSo I try to have compassion for them. Even when they're being cruel.\n\nBut it still sucks. It still stings. And it's something I'm going to have to deal with for a long time, I think.\n\nBut I'm strong. I'm resilient. And I'm not going to let anyone else's judgment define me. I know who I am, and I know what I believe in. And that's all that matters.\n\nAnd honestly? If they don't like it, they can just\u2026 deal with it. I have more important things to worry about. Like finding the perfect vintage dress.", "Okay, this is\u2026 hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa. They seem genuinely wonderful. It's just\u2026 it's my baby. You know? And letting go is terrifying.\n\nOne thing that worries me is\u2026 will they understand him or her? Will they get my sense of humor? Will they appreciate his or her quirks? I know that sounds silly, but it's important to me. I want my baby to be loved for who he or she is, not for who someone else wants him or her to be.\n\nI also worry about whether they'll be open and honest about the adoption. I want my baby to know his or her story, to know where he or she came from. I don't want it to be a secret.\n\nAnd I worry about whether they'll be able to handle the tough stuff. Raising a kid is hard. There will be challenges and setbacks. I want to make sure they're prepared for that.\n\nI've talked to them about all of these things, of course. They've been really receptive and understanding. They've promised to be open and honest with the baby, and to support him or her through thick and thin.\n\nBut it's still hard to let go of those worries. It's hard to trust that someone else will love my baby as much as I do.\n\nI know it's the right decision, though. I know that Mark and Vanessa will give my baby a good life. But that doesn't make it any easier.\n\nI just want what's best for him or her. And I hope, with all my heart, that I'm making the right choice. It's just\u2026 a lot to process. And it's scary. Really scary. I just hope they remember to play The Moldy Peaches. That's all I ask.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on the ultrasound technician. Seriously. Like, I'm already dealing with a million emotions, and she thinks it's okay to give me the side-eye and make passive-aggressive comments about \"the miracle of life\"? It's infuriating.\n\nHonestly, most of the time I just shut down. I give them a blank stare and try to tune them out. It's a survival mechanism, you know? I've learned to build walls.\n\nBut sometimes, I do say something. Usually it's sarcastic, because that's my default setting. Like, I told the technician, \"Oh, I'm sorry, did my life choices inconvenience your day?\" She didn't say anything after that.\n\nWith other people, it's a little more complicated. My dad's friends, for example. They keep asking me if I'm \"sure\" about this, and if I've \"considered all my options.\" Like I haven't been thinking about this for months!\n\nI usually try to explain my reasoning, calmly and rationally. I tell them that I'm doing what's best for the baby, and for myself. But sometimes, they just don't get it. They have their own preconceived notions about what's right and wrong, and they're not willing to listen.\n\nWhen that happens, I just walk away. I don't have the energy to argue with people who are determined to judge me.\n\nBren has been really good about helping me with this. She tells me that I don't owe anyone an explanation. That my decision is my own, and that I don't need to justify it to anyone.\n\nIt's hard, though. It's hard to be constantly questioned and judged. It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong, even though I know I'm not.\n\nBut I'm learning to trust my own instincts. And I'm learning to surround myself with people who support me, and who respect my decisions. And I'm learning to ignore the haters. Because honestly, they're not worth my time.\n\nIt's my life, and my decision. And I'm going to do what's right for me, even if it means disappointing some people along the way. And that's something I have to remember. Every. Single. Day.", "(A long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 a hard question. It's not like anything I've ever felt before.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026 weird. Like, looking at a blurry black and white image and being told that's *me*. That's\u2026 growing inside me. It didn't feel real. It felt like something out of a science fiction movie.\n\nThen, it started to sink in. I saw the little heartbeat, flickering on the screen. And I just\u2026 started to cry.\n\nNot like, sobbing, hysterical crying. But quiet tears. Just streaming down my face.\n\nIt was a mix of emotions. Fear, definitely. I was terrified about the future, about being a mom, about giving the baby up.\n\nBut there was also\u2026 joy. A tiny spark of joy. A feeling of connection. Like, this little person was already a part of me. And even though I knew I couldn't keep him or her, I still felt a sense of responsibility and love.\n\nIt was also\u2026 sad. Really sad. Knowing that I wouldn't get to experience all the milestones, all the firsts. The first smile, the first word, the first step. It broke my heart.\n\nAnd it was\u2026 humbling. To realize that I was carrying a life inside me. It was a powerful and overwhelming feeling.\n\nI didn't say anything. I just sat there, staring at the screen, and letting the tears fall. Bren held my hand, and she didn't say anything either. She just squeezed my hand and let me feel my feelings.\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. It was the most emotional moment of my life, I think. And it changed me. It made me realize that this wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person, and about giving him or her the best possible life.\n\nIt's still hard to talk about. But it's something I'll never forget. That blurry black and white image. That flickering heartbeat. And the overwhelming mix of emotions that washed over me. It was\u2026 everything.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh. *That*. Seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It's been, like, forever.\n\nLook, it was a gesture. A complicated, poorly thought-out, hormonally-charged gesture.\n\nBleeker was\u2026 sweet. In a clueless, puppy-dog kind of way. And he was trying. He was really trying to be cool and mature and everything. But he was also\u2026 kinda awkward. And I was feeling awkward too.\n\nI was pregnant, okay? My emotions were all over the place. I was scared and confused and overwhelmed. And I didn't know how to express myself.\n\nSo I did what any rational, hormonally-imbalanced teenager would do: I bought a bunch of Tic Tacs and stuffed them in his mailbox.\n\nIt was supposed to be\u2026 symbolic. Like, a little burst of sweetness in his otherwise mundane life. A way of saying, \"I see you. I appreciate you. But also, this is really weird.\"\n\nI don't know. It just felt right at the time. It was a stupid thing to do, I admit it. But it was also\u2026 kind of endearing.\n\nAnd honestly, it got his attention. Which, let's be real, was part of the point.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I put the Tic Tacs in his mailbox. It was a stupid, impulsive, teenage thing to do. And I don't regret it. Not really. It's a good story, at least. And it's a reminder of a really strange and complicated time in my life.\n\nNow, can we please talk about something else? Like, I don't know, the existential dread of being a teenager? Or the merits of vintage clothing? Anything but the Tic Tacs. Please.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Don't even get me started. That whole thing was\u2026 a mess. A beautifully awkward, emotionally stunted mess.\n\nOkay, so after I finally, *finally* told him how I felt \u2013 which, by the way, was the most terrifying thing I've ever done \u2013 things got\u2026 weird. Like, exponentially weirder.\n\nHe was really sweet about it, which was nice. He said he liked me too, but\u2026 not in the same way. He was just\u2026 not ready for a relationship. He was too focused on his music, and his band, and being a generally awkward teenager.\n\nWhich, okay, I get it. But it still stung. A lot.\n\nAfter that, we tried to be friends, but it was never the same. There was this\u2026 tension. This awkwardness. Every time we were around each other, I couldn't help but wonder what could have been. And I could tell he was feeling it too.\n\nWe still hung out sometimes, mostly because we had mutual friends. But it was always\u2026 strained. We'd avoid eye contact, and we'd talk about everything *except* our feelings.\n\nIt was like we were both trying to pretend that nothing had happened, but we both knew that something had changed.\n\nEventually, we just drifted apart. It wasn't a dramatic breakup or anything. It was just\u2026 a slow fade. We stopped texting, we stopped hanging out, we stopped talking.\n\nIt was sad, but it was also kind of a relief. It was exhausting trying to be friends with someone you have feelings for, especially when those feelings aren't reciprocated.\n\nI still think about him sometimes. I wonder what he's doing, and if he ever thinks about me. But I've accepted that we're not meant to be together.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm okay with that. I've learned a lot from the experience. I've learned that it's okay to be vulnerable, even if it's scary. And I've learned that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go.\n\nSo yeah. That's how our relationship changed. It went from potential romance to awkward friendship to\u2026 nothing. It wasn't the ending I wanted, but it was the ending I needed. And I'm moving on. Slowly, but surely. And with a lot of sarcasm. Because that's what I do.", "(Sighs) Oh, Bleeker. That guy. Okay, look, that whole thing was\u2026 complicated. And probably a really dumb idea in retrospect.\n\nThe chalk message\u2026 it was a way of saying something I couldn't say out loud. I was scared, okay? Terrified. I was pregnant, and I didn't know what to do. And Bleeker\u2026 he was just *there*. He was kind of a blank slate. A safe space.\n\nI knew he was into me, and I knew I wasn't into him in *that* way. But he was a good listener, and he didn't judge me. So I went to his stoop, and I wrote that message \u2013 \"Please don't bother me\" \u2013 because I needed him to back off. I needed space.\n\nBut it wasn't just about him. It was about everything. It was about my life falling apart, and about feeling completely lost and alone. It was about trying to regain some control in a situation where I had none.\n\nIt was a really passive-aggressive thing to do, I know. I'm not proud of it. But it was the only way I could think of to communicate what I was feeling at the time.\n\nAnd honestly, it worked. He got the message. He left me alone. And that's all I wanted.\n\nIt was a stupid, childish thing to do. But it was also a desperate act of self-preservation. And sometimes, when you're feeling overwhelmed, you just do stupid things. You just try to survive.\n\nSo yeah. That's the significance of the chalk message. It was a cry for help, disguised as a rejection. And it was a reminder that even the smallest actions can have a big impact. Especially when you're a messed-up teenager trying to navigate a really complicated life.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Don't even get me started. He's\u2026 a lot. A sweet lot, but a *lot*.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was mostly annoyed by him. He was so\u2026 eager. So earnest. So\u2026 Bleeker. It was overwhelming. I was dealing with a lot, and I didn't need a clueless, guitar-playing boyfriend hovering around, trying to fix everything.\n\nBut he didn't give up on me. He kept showing up, even when I told him to go away. He brought me snacks, he listened to me vent, he just\u2026 *was there*.\n\nAnd slowly, I started to appreciate it. He didn't try to tell me what to do, or judge me for my decisions. He just supported me, unconditionally. He was a safe space, a place where I could be myself, without having to pretend.\n\nHe was also surprisingly good at making me laugh. Even when I was feeling really down, he could always find a way to make me smile. He's just\u2026 goofy. In a good way.\n\nHe helped me realize that I wasn't alone. That there were people who cared about me, and who wanted to help me through this. And that was a really important realization.\n\nHe was also really supportive of my decision to give the baby up for adoption. He didn't try to talk me out of it, or make me feel guilty. He just respected my choice, and he helped me prepare for it.\n\nSo yeah. Bleeker's support has been huge. He's not perfect, and he can be a little bit annoying sometimes. But he's a good person. And he's been a really good friend. And I'm really grateful for him. Even if I don't always tell him. It's hard to be vulnerable, you know? But he makes it a little bit easier. He's\u2026 a good egg. A really, really good egg.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I get a lot. And honestly, it's kinda personal. But alright, I'll explain.\n\nIt wasn't a conscious decision, at first. When I went to the doctor, they asked if I wanted to know, and I just\u2026 said no. I didn't really have a reason. It just didn't feel right.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it, and I realized why.\n\nKnowing the gender wouldn't change anything. It wouldn't change the fact that I was giving the baby up for adoption. It wouldn't change the fact that I was going through a really difficult time.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 adding another layer of complication to an already complicated situation. Like I was trying to control something that I couldn't control.\n\nI wanted to be able to connect with the baby without any preconceived notions. Without any expectations. I wanted to just\u2026 see the baby for who he or she was, without labeling them as a boy or a girl.\n\nIt felt more respectful, somehow. Like I was giving the baby the space to be themselves.\n\nAnd honestly, it felt a little bit like protecting myself. Knowing the gender would have made it feel more real, more permanent. And I wasn't ready for that.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I decided not to find out. It wasn't about being mysterious or dramatic. It was about wanting to keep things simple. It was about wanting to connect with the baby on a deeper level. And it was about protecting myself from getting too attached.\n\nIt's not for everyone, I know. But it felt right for me. And that's all that matters.", "(Eyes widen, a slight shudder runs through me)\n\nOkay, *wow*. You went there. You actually went there. That's\u2026 a very specific and unsettling question.\n\nLook, I've thought about it. Obviously. It's hard *not* to think about it when Mark and Vanessa are talking about their life plans and their\u2026 preferences.\n\nThe idea of a \"scary neuter-baby\" \u2013 as you so eloquently put it \u2013 is\u2026 terrifying. It's not about the baby being \"scary,\" it's about the potential for things to go wrong. For the baby to be different, to have challenges, to need extra care.\n\nI want the best for this baby. I want him or her to be happy and healthy and to have a good life. And the thought of something being\u2026 off\u2026 is really scary.\n\nBut I also know that different doesn't mean bad. And that every baby is a miracle, no matter what. And that Mark and Vanessa are loving and capable parents, and they would love this baby unconditionally, no matter what.\n\nI've talked to them about my fears, and they've been really reassuring. They've told me that they're prepared for anything, and that they would never love the baby any less if he or she had special needs.\n\nIt's still something I worry about, though. It's a big responsibility, and I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to give this baby the best possible start in life.\n\nHonestly, it's just\u2026 a lot to process. It's a reminder that life is unpredictable, and that you can't control everything. And that sometimes, you just have to trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to.\n\nSo yeah. It's scary. But it's also\u2026 hopeful. And I'm trying to focus on the hope. And to trust that Mark and Vanessa will love and care for this baby, no matter what. Even if he or she is a little bit\u2026 scary. (Shudders again) Don't remind me.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Okay, look, don't get me wrong. Paulie Bleeker is\u2026 a good guy. A *really* good guy. He's sweet, and he's funny, and he's genuinely kind. And he's a really good guitar player.\n\nBut our relationship? It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt started out as just a friendship. We bonded over music, and we spent hours just talking and hanging out. He was always there for me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nAnd then, things got\u2026 more complicated. We started to have feelings for each other. But I was scared. I didn't want to ruin our friendship. And I definitely wasn't ready for a relationship. Especially not when I was\u2026 you know.\n\nI pushed him away a lot. I was sarcastic and dismissive and just generally difficult. I didn't want to let him get too close. I was afraid of getting hurt.\n\nBut he kept coming back. He was persistent, and he was patient. And he eventually wore me down.\n\nWe had a few good moments together. Some really good moments. But it was always\u2026 awkward. And messy. And I always felt like I was holding something back.\n\nI think we both wanted different things. He wanted a traditional relationship. I just wanted\u2026 I don't even know what I wanted. I was just trying to figure things out.\n\nIn the end, we decided to just be friends. It was the right decision, I think. We're better off as friends.\n\nI still care about him, a lot. He's one of the few people who really understands me. But I don't think we were meant to be together. We're just too different.\n\nIt's a bittersweet thing, you know? I'm glad we're friends. But I also wish things could have been different. But that's life, I guess. It's messy and complicated and rarely goes according to plan.\n\nSo yeah. That's our relationship. Complicated. Messy. Bittersweet. And ultimately, just\u2026 a friendship. A really good friendship. But just a friendship.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, that's for sure. But ultimately, my family came through for me. In their own weird ways.\n\nMy dad, Mac, was\u2026 stunned at first. Like, completely speechless. He's not the most emotionally expressive guy, you know? But he didn't yell, or get angry, or anything like that. He just\u2026 looked sad. And then he hugged me.\n\nIt took him a while to process everything. He kept asking me if I was sure, and if I had thought things through. But he never once told me what to do. He just wanted me to be happy.\n\nBren, my stepmom, was a lifesaver. Seriously. She was the one who really stepped up. She took me to all my doctor's appointments, she helped me research adoption, and she just\u2026 listened. She didn't judge me, she didn't lecture me, she just offered her support.\n\nShe was the one who found Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting the baby. She did all the paperwork and made all the arrangements. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nMy dad and Bren were both really supportive of my decision to give the baby up for adoption. They understood that it was the right thing to do, even if it was a difficult thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, though. There were moments of tension and disagreement. My dad worried about me, and Bren worried about everything. But they always put my needs first.\n\nAnd even though it was a tough time, it actually brought us closer together. It forced us to talk about things we had never talked about before. It forced us to be honest with each other.\n\nSo yeah. My family was a huge source of support during my pregnancy. They weren't perfect, but they were there for me. And I'm really grateful for that. They helped me get through one of the hardest times of my life. And I think, in the end, we all grew from the experience. Even my dad, who still doesn't quite understand my obsession with vintage clothes.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't pretty, let me tell you. It felt like my whole world was falling apart, and I was just trying to hold on for dear life.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were a blur of denial and anger and just\u2026 feeling completely lost. I didn't know who I was anymore. I was just\u2026 pregnant. And that felt like it defined me, and I hated it.\n\nI started pulling away from my friends. I didn't want them to see me like this. I didn't want their pity. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nBut Bren\u2026 she wouldn't let me. She kept checking in on me, even when I was being a total jerk. She just sat with me, and listened, and didn't judge. And slowly, I started to open up.\n\nTalking about my feelings was the hardest part. I'm not a very emotional person, usually. I tend to bottle things up. But Bren helped me to realize that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help.\n\nI also started writing poetry. It was a way to process my emotions, to make sense of everything that was happening. It was a way to express myself when I couldn't find the words to say out loud.\n\nAnd I started to realize that this wasn't just about the pregnancy. It was about growing up. It was about figuring out who I was, and what I wanted out of life. It was about accepting that I wasn't perfect, and that it was okay to make mistakes.\n\nIt was a long and messy process. There were a lot of tears, and a lot of self-doubt. But I got through it. And I came out stronger on the other side.\n\nI learned that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers. And I learned that I'm not alone. There are people who care about me, and who will support me no matter what.\n\nAnd I learned that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. And that sometimes, the hardest experiences are the ones that teach you the most about yourself.\n\nSo yeah. It wasn't easy. But I survived. And I'm grateful for that. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me along the way. Especially Bren. She's the best.", "Okay, this is a serious question. Don't even *think* about judging my taste in music.\n\nMy favorite band is, without a doubt, **The Moldy Peaches**.\n\nYeah, I know. They're kinda obscure. And their songs are\u2026 weird. But that's why I love them.\n\nAdam Green and Kimya Dawson are geniuses. They write these incredibly honest and vulnerable songs about love, loss, and everything in between. Their lyrics are funny, heartbreaking, and totally relatable.\n\nThey don't try to be cool or polished or anything like that. They just write songs about their lives, and they do it in a way that's both charming and disarming.\n\nTheir music makes me feel\u2026 seen. Like someone understands what I'm going through. Like it's okay to be weird and imperfect and messy.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" is my absolute favorite song. It's just\u2026 perfect. It's about wanting to be with someone, even if they're not the right person for you. It's about the pain of unrequited love. It's about the absurdity of life.\n\nI discovered them when I was going through a really tough time, and their music helped me to get through it. It reminded me that I wasn't alone.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. And if you don't like them, that's your problem. Just don't try to tell me I have bad taste in music. Because I don't. I have *excellent* taste in music. It's just\u2026 unconventional. Like me.", "(Sighs heavily) Is water wet? Is the sky blue? Is my life a complete and utter mess? Yes. Yes, yes, and yes.\n\nIt's\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's hard enough being a teenager, trying to figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life. Add pregnancy into the mix, and it's like someone turned the volume up to eleven.\n\nI feel like I'm being pulled in a million different directions. Everyone has an opinion on what I should do, and it's hard to know what's right. I'm trying to figure out who *I* am, separate from what everyone else wants me to be.\n\nAnd it's not just about the baby. It's about everything. My future, my relationships, my dreams. Everything feels uncertain and unstable.\n\nI used to think I had it all figured out. I knew who I was, what I liked, what I wanted. But now\u2026 I feel like I'm starting from scratch. Like I'm building a new identity, piece by piece.\n\nIt's scary, honestly. It's terrifying. But it's also\u2026 kind of exciting. I'm learning a lot about myself. I'm discovering strengths I didn't know I had.\n\nAnd I'm realizing that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused and uncertain. It's okay to make mistakes.\n\nThe hardest part is making decisions. Every decision feels like it has huge consequences. And I'm afraid of making the wrong one.\n\nBut I'm trying to trust my gut. I'm trying to listen to my heart. And I'm trying to remember that I'm not alone.\n\nIt's a journey, I guess. A messy, complicated, unpredictable journey. And I'm just trying to navigate it the best I can. One day at a time. And with a whole lot of sarcasm. Because sometimes, that's all you can do.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I've really put into words before, honestly. It's still\u2026 raw.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought love was just\u2026 romantic. Like in the movies. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they live happily ever after. It was all very simplistic. And responsibility? That was just something my parents told me to do \u2013 clean my room, do my homework, be a good person.\n\nBut this\u2026 this changed everything.\n\nI realized that love isn't just about feelings. It's about sacrifice. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about making difficult decisions, even when they hurt.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the most loving thing I could do for the baby. I realized that true love isn't about keeping something for yourself. It's about wanting what's best for the other person, even if that means letting them go.\n\nAnd responsibility\u2026 that's not just about following rules. It's about taking ownership of your actions. It's about facing the consequences of your choices. It's about being accountable for your own life.\n\nI was responsible for creating this life. And I was responsible for making the best decision for that life, even if it meant giving it up. It was a heavy burden, but it was also empowering.\n\nI also learned a lot about love from Bren and my dad. They showed me what unconditional love looks like. They supported me through everything, without judgment. They helped me to see that I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd I learned about love from Mark and Vanessa. They showed me that there are good people in the world who are willing to open their hearts and their homes to a child in need.\n\nSo yeah. This journey completely changed my understanding of love and responsibility. It taught me that they're not just abstract concepts. They're real, messy, complicated things that require courage, sacrifice, and a whole lot of heart.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, of course. I'm still learning. But I think I'm a better person because of it. And I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned, even the painful ones. Because they've helped me to grow, and to understand what truly matters in life. And that's something I'll carry with me forever.", "(A long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 that's a hard question. I've thought about that moment a lot. Before, during\u2026 and now.\n\nIt wasn't like in the movies. There wasn't a sudden rush of overwhelming love, or a magical connection. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nI was so nervous. My hands were shaking. I was scared I'd say the wrong thing, or do the wrong thing. I was scared I'd fall apart.\n\nAnd then\u2026 there he was. Little Aaron. So small. So\u2026 perfect.\n\nHe was sleeping, all bundled up in a blanket. Mark was holding him, and Vanessa was right beside them, smiling.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 stared.\n\nIt was like looking at a stranger. A tiny, beautiful stranger. And a part of me felt\u2026 empty. Sad. Like I was giving away a piece of myself.\n\nBut then, Mark handed him to me. And I held him. And he was so warm, and so soft. And he smelled like\u2026 baby.\n\nAnd something shifted.\n\nIt wasn't instant love, but it was\u2026 a feeling. A feeling of protectiveness. A feeling of responsibility. A feeling of\u2026 awe.\n\nI realized that this little person was going to have a life. A good life. A life filled with love and happiness. And I had played a part in making that happen.\n\nAnd that made me feel\u2026 proud. And relieved. And a little bit heartbroken.\n\nIt was the most confusing, most overwhelming, most beautiful moment of my life.\n\nI didn't cry. I just\u2026 held him. And I whispered, \"Hi, Aaron.\"\n\nAnd then I gave him back to Mark and Vanessa. Because he belonged with them.\n\nAnd I walked away.\n\nAnd I knew that I had made the right decision. Even though it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I know that Aaron is loved. And that's all that matters.\n\n(Another long pause. A small, sad smile.)\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. It was a lot.", "Ugh. Paulie. That's\u2026 complicated. Okay, look. It wasn't like I *wanted* to keep it a secret. It's just\u2026 I was scared.\n\nScared of a lot of things, actually. Scared of ruining our friendship. Scared of him not wanting to be with me anymore. Scared of him feeling obligated to be involved.\n\nHe's a good guy, Paulie. A really good guy. But he's\u2026 uncomplicated. He likes things simple. And this was anything *but* simple.\n\nI knew telling him would change everything. And I wasn't sure I was ready for that. I needed time to figure things out for myself, to make a plan, to come to terms with everything that was happening.\n\nI also didn't want him to feel like he had to be a hero. Like he had to save me. I didn't *need* saving. I just needed to figure things out on my own.\n\nAnd honestly, I was afraid he'd try to convince me to keep the baby. And I knew I couldn't keep the baby. It wouldn't be fair to anyone.\n\nSo I just\u2026 kept it to myself. It was a terrible decision, I know. But it felt like the right one at the time.\n\nI thought I could handle it on my own. I thought I could protect him from the messiness of it all. But I was wrong.\n\nIt hurt him, I know it did. And I feel terrible about that. But I just\u2026 I didn't know what else to do. I was young and scared and confused. And I made a mistake.\n\nIt's something I regret. But I've learned from it. And I'm trying to make amends. It's just\u2026 it's not easy. Especially when you're dealing with a guy like Paulie. He's a good guy, but he's also\u2026 a little bit clueless sometimes.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I didn't tell him. It wasn't about not trusting him. It was about protecting him. And protecting myself. And it was a really, really bad idea.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 mortifying. Seriously.\n\nOkay, so here's the story. It wasn't like I just casually dropped the bomb or anything. I was trying to be super discreet. I didn't want anyone to know, especially not Paulie.\n\nBut Leah\u2026 Leah has a big mouth. A *really* big mouth.\n\nShe found out from Vanessa, the woman who's adopting the baby. Apparently, Vanessa was at the diner where Leah works, and they started talking. And Leah, being Leah, just\u2026 pried. She asked a bunch of questions, and Vanessa eventually told her everything.\n\nAnd then, of course, Leah immediately told Paulie. She said she felt bad for keeping it a secret, and that he had a right to know. Which, okay, maybe she had a point. But still!\n\nI was furious. I mean, seriously, Leah? You couldn't have just kept your mouth shut for five minutes?\n\nPaulie found out right before the snowstorm, and he was\u2026 understandably confused and upset. He didn't say much at first, he just kind of stared at me with this heartbroken look on his face.\n\nIt was awful. I felt terrible for hurting him. But I also felt like I had a right to make my own decisions, and to keep my personal life private.\n\nIt was a really messy situation. And it definitely complicated things between Paulie and me. But in the end, it actually brought us closer together. He eventually understood why I made the choices I did, and he supported me.\n\nBut seriously, Leah. I'm still not over it. She owes me big time. Like, a lifetime supply of vintage clothes big time.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one, isn't it? The question everyone wants to ask. It wasn't a simple decision, not by a long shot. It felt like everything was spinning out of control, and I was just trying to hold on.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 scared. Terrified, actually. I was sixteen! I hadn't even figured out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a baby. The thought of being a mom right now felt\u2026 impossible.\n\nI considered other options, of course. Everyone kept asking me about them. But abortion\u2026 it just didn't feel right. I know people have different opinions, and that's okay. But for me, it felt like\u2026 giving up. Like I was erasing something important.\n\nAnd then there was adoption. At first, I didn't even want to think about it. It felt like admitting defeat. Like I wasn't good enough to be a mom.\n\nBut Bren, my stepmom, she helped me see it differently. She said it wasn't about giving up, it was about making a selfless choice. It was about giving the baby the best possible life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them.\n\nAnd she was right. I realized that I couldn't give the baby what it needed right now. I couldn't give it a stable home, a secure future, a loving family.\n\nSo I started looking into adoption agencies. And I met Mark and Vanessa. And something just\u2026 clicked. They were kind and compassionate and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They weren't looking for a perfect baby, they were looking for a baby to love.\n\nAnd that's when I knew. That's when I realized that adoption was the right choice. It wasn't easy, and it still isn't. There are days when I'm filled with sadness and regret. But I know that I'm doing what's best for the baby.\n\nIt's about wanting the best for this little person, even if that means letting go. It's about being brave enough to make a difficult decision. And it's about trusting that everything will be okay.\n\nIt's not the life I imagined for myself, but it's my life. And I'm trying to make the best of it. And I'm hoping that, someday, I'll be able to look back on this and know that I made the right choice. For everyone involved.", "(A long silence. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't. Just\u2026 don't. That was\u2026 that was the worst. Worse than the morning sickness, worse than the judgment, worse than everything.\n\nI mean, I knew he wasn't exactly\u2026 emotionally available. He was Bleeker, you know? Sweet, but kinda clueless. But I thought\u2026 I *hoped*\u2026 that once the baby was born, he'd feel something. That he'd want to be involved.\n\nAnd then he just\u2026 didn't. He said he wasn't ready. That he wasn't a \"dad person.\" He said he wanted to focus on his music.\n\nIt wasn't about the baby. It was about *him*.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 a rejection. Not just of the baby, but of me. Like I wasn't good enough to be a mother, and he wasn't good enough to be a father.\n\nI tried to be understanding. I tried to see things from his perspective. But it was hard. Really hard.\n\nI remember just\u2026 crying. A lot. I felt so angry, and so sad, and so alone.\n\nBren was amazing, though. She just held me and let me cry. She didn't try to fix things, she just let me feel my feelings.\n\nIt made me realize that I was doing the right thing, giving the baby up for adoption. Because that baby deserved a father who wanted to be there. A father who would love and cherish him or her unconditionally.\n\nIt still hurts, though. It always will. But I'm trying to move on. I'm trying to focus on the future. And I'm trying to remember that I deserve someone who wants to be with me, and the baby deserves someone who wants to be a parent.\n\nIt just\u2026 sucked. It really, really sucked. And I don't like talking about it. So can we please talk about something else now? Like, vintage dresses or indie bands or anything? Please?", "(A long pause. I fidget with the hem of my\u2026 well, the sweater I'm wearing. It's vintage, obviously.)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a lot. More than I expected, honestly.\n\nI knew Vanessa and Mark were excited. They'd been so kind to me throughout everything. But seeing them\u2026 *with* him\u2026 it was different. It was real.\n\nHe was tiny. So tiny. And Vanessa\u2026 she looked like a tornado had gone through her hair, and she was wearing mismatched socks, and she was completely overwhelmed. But she was also\u2026 glowing. Like she was radiating happiness.\n\nAnd she was just\u2026 looking at him. Like he was the most amazing thing she'd ever seen. And he was. He *is*.\n\nIt was\u2026 bittersweet. Really bittersweet. There was a part of me that wanted to scoop him up and hold him forever. A part of me that wondered what my life would be like if I had kept him.\n\nBut then I looked at Vanessa, and I saw how much she loved him already. And I knew that I had made the right decision. He was going to have a good life. He was going to be loved and cherished.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing her so happy\u2026 it made me happy too. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I didn't have to worry about him anymore. I could just\u2026 let go.\n\nIt was messy. It was emotional. It was everything I expected and nothing like I expected all at the same time.\n\nI just stood there for a minute, watching them. And then I smiled. A real smile. And I knew that everything was going to be okay. For all of us.\n\nIt didn't erase the sadness, or the guilt, or the uncertainty. But it gave me hope. And that's all I needed.\n\n(I look away, blinking back tears. It's still\u2026 raw. Even after all this time.)\n\nShe looked\u2026 incredibly happy. And that's what mattered. That's all that mattered.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* song. Seriously? You're going there? Okay, fine. Let's unpack this. It's not like I haven't overanalyzed it enough already.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" by The Moldy Peaches\u2026 it's\u2026 complicated. It's not just a cute, quirky song about liking someone. It's about wanting someone so badly, but also being terrified of getting hurt. It's about being vulnerable, and admitting that you have feelings, even when you know it might not work out.\n\nFor Bleeker and me, it was\u2026 a soundtrack to our mess. We were both awkward and insecure and trying to figure things out. We weren't exactly good at communicating our feelings. So we just\u2026 listened to that song. A lot.\n\nIt was a way of saying what we couldn't say out loud. Like, \"I like you, but I'm scared. I want to be with you, but I don't want to get my heart broken.\" It was a safe way to express our feelings, without actually having to be honest with each other.\n\nAnd it was also a way of acknowledging that we were both a little bit broken. We both had our issues, our baggage, our insecurities. And we were drawn to each other because of those things. We saw a little bit of ourselves in each other.\n\nIt's ironic, really. The song is about wanting someone *other* than the person you're with. But for us, it was about wanting *each other*, even though we were both so messed up.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect relationship. It was messy and complicated and sometimes really painful. But it was also real. And that song\u2026 it captured the essence of our relationship perfectly. It was our song. And even now, when I hear it, I can't help but think of Bleeker. And all the good and bad times we shared.\n\nIt's a bittersweet song. But it's also a beautiful song. And it's a song that will always remind me of him. And of that time in my life. Ugh. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on the baby shower situation. It's\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little bit insulting.\n\nI think people are unsure because\u2026 well, because I'm giving the baby *up*. It's not like I'm keeping it. It's not a traditional pregnancy. It's not a traditional anything.\n\nThey want to be supportive, I get that. But they don't really know *how* to be supportive. They're used to baby showers being about celebrating a new mom and a new family. And that's not what this is.\n\nIt feels weird to celebrate something that I'm actively choosing *not* to keep. It feels like they're acknowledging the baby, but ignoring my feelings. Like they're trying to pretend that this is a happy occasion for me, when it's actually really sad and complicated.\n\nBren tried to explain it to people, but it's hard to get them to understand. They just keep saying things like, \"Oh, you'll change your mind!\" or \"You're so brave!\" which is\u2026 not helpful.\n\nI appreciate the thought, I really do. But I don't need a baby shower. I need people to respect my decision and to support me through this process. I need them to understand that this is a difficult time for me, and that I'm not looking for a party.\n\nI told Bren I'd rather just have a small gathering with a few close friends, where we can just talk and be there for each other. No pink balloons or tiny booties, please. Just\u2026 realness.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. People don't always understand what you're going through. They try to help, but they end up making things worse. And sometimes, all you need is for people to just listen. And to respect your choices. Even if they don't agree with them.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on that. It's still making me mad, honestly.\n\nOkay, so, Bren isn't mad that I was spending time with Mark and Vanessa. She's *happy* that I'm building a relationship with them. She wants me to feel comfortable and connected to the people who are going to raise my baby.\n\nBut she thinks I was being\u2026 inappropriate. She thinks I was trying to create a \"friendship\" with Mark that was beyond what was appropriate, given the circumstances.\n\nShe said it looked like I was trying to replace the father of my baby, or that I was trying to get something from him. Like, I was trying to get him to like me, or to feel sorry for me.\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't even realize I was doing that. I just\u2026 liked talking to him. He's a really nice guy, and he's really into music, just like me. We bonded over movies and CDs and stuff. It was just a way to pass the time.\n\nBut Bren said it was sending the wrong message. She said it was confusing the situation, and that it wasn't fair to Mark or Vanessa. She said I needed to maintain a professional distance, and to focus on making the best decision for the baby.\n\nI get what she's saying, I guess. But it still feels unfair. I just wanted to have a normal relationship with the people who are going to be the baby's parents. Is that too much to ask?\n\nShe said it's about boundaries, and about respecting the fact that Mark and Vanessa are a couple. And that I need to be mindful of their feelings.\n\nIt's just\u2026 complicated. And it's frustrating. I feel like I can't do anything right. I'm just trying to navigate this whole situation the best way I can, and it feels like everyone is judging me.\n\nBut Bren's right. I probably did overstep a boundary. And I need to be more careful in the future. It's just\u2026 hard. It's all just really hard.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Okay, buckle up, because this is a whole thing.\n\nMy mom, Brenna\u2026 she's\u2026 a free spirit. A wanderer. She's been married, like, four times. And none of them lasted very long. She says she's just not \"cut out for domesticity.\" Which is a polite way of saying she runs when things get too real.\n\nShe thinks I don't understand marriage because I've never experienced it firsthand. She thinks it's all about compromise and sacrifice and settling down, and she believes I'm too independent and headstrong to ever be happy in a traditional marriage.\n\nShe also thinks I'm too cynical. She says I've built up walls around my heart, and that I'm afraid of getting hurt. And honestly, she's probably right.\n\nBut it's not just that. She also thinks I'm naive. She thinks I romanticize relationships, and that I don't understand the hard work and commitment that it takes to make a marriage last.\n\nShe's always saying things like, \"You'll learn, honey. You'll learn that love isn't always enough.\" Which is\u2026 depressing.\n\nI think she's projecting her own experiences onto me. She's had a lot of bad luck in love, and she doesn't want me to make the same mistakes she did.\n\nBut I also think she's just\u2026 different from me. She's a dreamer, and I'm a realist. She's spontaneous, and I'm cautious. She's always looking for the next adventure, and I'm looking for a sense of stability.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't love her. I do. But it doesn't mean I agree with everything she says. And it definitely doesn't mean I don't know anything about the dynamics of marriage. I've just seen a different side of it. A side that's a little bit messy and a little bit heartbreaking. And I'm trying to learn from that. Even if my mom doesn't think I can.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't one big thing, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and decided, \"Okay, adoption is the way to go.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nMostly, it came down to being realistic. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not ready to give a baby the life it deserves. Not yet.\n\nI want that baby to have everything. A stable home, loving parents, opportunities I just can't provide right now. I want it to have a future.\n\nAnd I realized that giving it up for adoption wasn't giving up on the baby. It was giving it a *better* chance. It was a selfless act, even though it felt incredibly selfish at the time.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited, and they're so prepared. I know they'll love that baby unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. And I still have moments where I question myself, where I wonder if I'm doing the right thing.\n\nBut I have to believe that I am. I have to believe that this is the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nIt's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby. And that's what matters most.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It's painful. But it's also the right thing to do. And I'm trying to find peace with that. It's a process. And I'm still working on it. But I know, deep down, that I'm making the best decision I can. For the baby. And for myself.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It feels like a lifetime ago, and also like yesterday, all at the same time.\n\nI learned\u2026 a lot. More than I ever thought possible.\n\nI learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always considered myself pretty independent and resilient, but this was a whole different level. Dealing with the pregnancy, the adoption, the judgment\u2026 it was exhausting. But I kept going. I found a way to survive.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so fiercely independent, so afraid of showing vulnerability. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, even Leah, even when things were complicated.\n\nI learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. I spent so much time trying to figure everything out, trying to control the situation. But I realized that life is messy and unpredictable, and you just have to roll with the punches.\n\nI learned that compassion is really important. Not just for others, but for yourself. I was so hard on myself for a long time. But I realized that I deserved kindness and understanding, just like everyone else.\n\nI learned that family isn't always about blood. It's about the people who love and support you, no matter what. Bren showed me that. Mark and Vanessa showed me that.\n\nAnd I learned that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. Even when things feel hopeless, there's always a reason to keep going.\n\nHonestly, this whole experience changed me. It forced me to grow up, to confront my fears, to figure out what really matters to me.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before I got pregnant. I'm more mature, more compassionate, more resilient. And I'm grateful for that. Even though it was a really difficult journey.\n\nIt taught me a lot about myself. And it taught me a lot about life. And I think, in the long run, that's a good thing. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a good question. It's not like it was an instant connection, you know? It started off really formal. Lots of meetings with social workers, lots of awkward small talk. They were\u2026 nice. Very nice. But they were also strangers. And I was giving them my baby. That's a lot to process.\n\nAt first, I was mostly just trying to figure out if they were good people. If they were going to love and care for the baby the way he or she deserved. I grilled them with questions. About their jobs, their home, their values. I wanted to know everything.\n\nAnd they were really patient with me. They answered all my questions honestly, and they never got offended by my skepticism. They understood that I was scared and uncertain.\n\nAs we spent more time together, though, things started to change. We started talking about things other than the baby. About our lives, our interests, our dreams. I learned that Mark was a really talented woodworker, and Vanessa was a kindergarten teacher. They were just\u2026 normal people.\n\nI started to see them not as potential parents, but as people I actually liked. They were kind and compassionate and funny. They made me feel comfortable and safe.\n\nAnd they started to see me as more than just a pregnant teenager. They saw me as a person with feelings and hopes and fears. They listened to me, they supported me, and they never judged me.\n\nBy the end of the process, we weren't just going through an adoption. We were building a relationship. A really special relationship.\n\nIt wasn't like they were replacing the baby's real parents, or anything. It was more like we were all becoming a family. A different kind of family, but a family nonetheless.\n\nI still get emotional thinking about it. It's hard to give up a baby, even when you know it's the right thing to do. But knowing that he or she is going to be loved and cared for by Vanessa and Mark\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nThey're good people. Really good people. And I'm grateful to them for everything. They've changed my life in ways I never could have imagined. And I hope I've changed theirs, too.", "(Long pause. She looks down at her hands, then back up, a little vulnerable.)\n\nRegrets\u2026 yeah. I have a few. It's not like it was all sunshine and rainbows, you know? Even though I knew adoption was the right thing to do, it didn't make it easy.\n\nI regret not telling my dad sooner. I was so scared of disappointing him, of ruining everything. But keeping it a secret just made things worse.\n\nI regret losing touch with Leah. We had a falling out, and we haven't really spoken since. I miss her, and I wish things could have been different.\n\nI regret letting the judgment of others get to me. It was hard to ignore the whispers and the stares. It made me feel ashamed and isolated.\n\nAnd I regret not being able to raise the baby myself. It's a bittersweet feeling, knowing that I gave him or her a chance at a good life, but also knowing that I won't be a part of their everyday life.\n\nBut\u2026 I don't regret the decision to choose adoption. I still believe it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.\n\nI've learned a lot from this experience. I've learned about strength, and resilience, and the importance of making difficult choices. I've learned about love, and loss, and the complexities of life.\n\nAnd I've learned that it's okay to have regrets. It's part of being human. It's part of growing up.\n\nI try not to dwell on the past. I try to focus on the future. And I try to learn from my mistakes.\n\nSo yeah. I have regrets. But I'm also grateful for the lessons I've learned. And I'm hopeful for what the future holds. Even if it's not the future I expected. It's *my* future. And that's all that matters.", "(A long pause. I fidget with the hem of my sleeve.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even with Bren. It still feels\u2026 raw.\n\nIt didn't magically fix everything, you know? It wasn't like, suddenly, all my problems disappeared. There were a lot of tears. A lot of second-guessing. A lot of just\u2026 emptiness.\n\nBut it *did* change me. In ways I'm still figuring out.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, really fast. I had to make a difficult decision, and I had to live with the consequences. It taught me about responsibility, and about sacrifice, and about the importance of putting someone else's needs before my own.\n\nIt also taught me about the power of love. Not romantic love, but the kind of love that comes from wanting the best for someone, even if it means letting them go. The love I feel for Mark and Vanessa, knowing they're giving my baby a wonderful life\u2026 it's a different kind of love, but it's still real.\n\nIt made me more empathetic. More understanding. More willing to see things from other people's perspectives.\n\nAnd it gave me a sense of purpose. Knowing that I made a selfless decision, that I gave my baby a chance at a good life\u2026 that makes me feel proud.\n\nIt's still hard, sometimes. I think about the baby a lot. I wonder what he or she is like. I wonder if he or she ever thinks about me.\n\nBut I know I made the right decision. And I know that my baby is loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt's shaped my future, too. I'm more focused on my education. I'm more determined to make something of myself. I want to be a good role model, for myself and for others.\n\nIt's not the life I expected. But it's my life. And I'm learning to embrace it, flaws and all. It's made me stronger, more resilient, and more grateful for the good things in my life.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. But it's also beautiful. And I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Even if it still hurts sometimes. It just\u2026 is. And I'm learning to live with it. And to grow from it.", "Okay. This is\u2026 important. If someone is listening, and they're going through something similar\u2026 I want them to know they're not alone. It feels like it, I know. It *really* feels like it. But you're not.\n\nFirst, **don't be afraid to talk to someone.** Anyone. Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Just\u2026 someone you trust. Keeping it bottled up inside will only make things worse.\n\nSecond, **know that you have options.** You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. You have the right to choose what's best for you and for the baby. And there are people who will support you, no matter what you decide.\n\nThird, **be kind to yourself.** This is a really difficult situation. You're going to have good days and bad days. You're going to feel a lot of different emotions. And that's okay. Don't beat yourself up over it.\n\nFourth, **don't let anyone tell you what to do.** This is *your* life, and *your* decision. Listen to advice, but ultimately, you have to do what feels right for you.\n\nFifth, **remember that you are strong.** You are capable of handling this. You are resilient. You are worthy of love and happiness.\n\nAnd sixth, **don't give up on your dreams.** Just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you have to put your life on hold. You can still go to school, you can still pursue your passions, you can still have a future.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be hard work. But you can do it. I believe in you.\n\nAnd if you need someone to talk to, or just someone to listen, please reach out. There are people who care. And you deserve to be supported.\n\nYou're not alone. And you're going to get through this. I promise. It might not feel like it right now, but you will. Just keep breathing. And keep believing in yourself.", "Ugh, blogging. It sounds so\u2026 performative. But Bren thought it was a good idea. She said it would be \u201ctherapeutic\u201d and a way to \u201cconnect with others.\u201d Which basically translated to \u201cstop moping and do something productive.\u201d\n\nHonestly, at first, I just did it to shut her up. I figured I\u2019d write a few posts, then abandon it. But then\u2026 people started reading it. And commenting. And sharing their own stories.\n\nIt was weird. And kind of scary. Putting my life out there for everyone to see. But it was also\u2026 surprisingly helpful.\n\nI started getting messages from other pregnant teenagers, from people who had gone through similar experiences. They told me I wasn\u2019t alone. They offered me support and encouragement. They made me feel less ashamed.\n\nAnd I realized that maybe, just maybe, my story could help someone else. Maybe it could make someone else feel less alone. Maybe it could challenge some of the stereotypes about teenage pregnancy.\n\nSo I kept writing. I wrote about the good days and the bad days. I wrote about my fears and my hopes. I wrote about the challenges of making a difficult decision.\n\nI tried to be honest and authentic. I didn\u2019t sugarcoat anything. I didn\u2019t pretend everything was perfect. I just wrote about my experience, as it was happening.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always easy. There were trolls and haters and people who just didn\u2019t understand. But the positive feedback outweighed the negative.\n\nAnd it helped me to process my own emotions. Writing things down made them feel less overwhelming. It helped me to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nSo yeah. That\u2019s why I started blogging. It started as a way to shut Bren up, but it turned into something more. It turned into a way to connect with others, to share my story, and to make a difference. Even if it\u2019s just a small one. It\u2019s still\u2026 something. And honestly, it\u2019s been a lot better than just sitting around feeling sorry for myself.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I've really put into words before, honestly.\n\nThe biggest lesson? It's not about the pregnancy itself. It's not about adoption. It's about\u2026 **strength**.\n\nI always thought I was pretty strong. I was independent, sarcastic, I didn't let people walk all over me. But this\u2026 this was a different kind of strength.\n\nIt was about facing something terrifying and uncertain, and making a difficult decision, even when everyone else was telling me what to do. It was about putting someone else's needs before my own. It was about accepting responsibility for my actions.\n\nIt was about learning to trust my gut, and to believe in myself, even when I was scared out of my mind.\n\nIt was about realizing that I'm capable of more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI used to think that strength meant being tough and emotionless. But I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to cry.\n\nTrue strength is about being honest with yourself, and about facing your fears. It's about being resilient, and about never giving up.\n\nAnd it's about knowing that even when things are really, really hard, you can still get through it.\n\nThis experience changed me. It made me grow up faster than I ever expected. It made me appreciate the people in my life. And it made me realize that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was.\n\nSo yeah. Strength. That's the biggest lesson I learned. And it's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's not a lesson I *wanted* to learn, but it's a lesson I needed to learn. And I'm grateful for it, in a weird, complicated way.", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one. The reason I've been doing all this talking in the first place, I guess.\n\nLook. It's scary. It's really, really scary. Your whole world just gets flipped upside down, and you're left trying to figure out what to do next. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to cry.\n\nBut you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to them. Talk to your parents, your friends, a counselor, anyone you trust. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nAnd don't let anyone tell you what to do. This is *your* decision. You have to do what's right for *you*, even if it's not what everyone else wants.\n\nThere are a lot of options. You can choose to parent, you can choose to adopt, you can choose to have an abortion. Each option has its own challenges and rewards. You need to weigh the pros and cons carefully, and make the decision that feels right for you.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to get information. Don't be afraid to seek help. There are resources available to you, and people who want to support you.\n\nAnd remember, this doesn't define you. This is just one chapter in your life. It doesn't have to ruin your future. You can still achieve your dreams. You can still be happy.\n\nIt's going to be hard. There will be difficult days. But you're stronger than you think. You can get through this.\n\nAnd most importantly, be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can. And that's all anyone can ask for.\n\nIt's not easy. But you're not alone. And you're going to be okay. I promise. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now. Just\u2026 breathe. And take things one day at a time. And remember, you deserve to be happy.", "Wow. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I've spent a lot of time thinking about, honestly. It's hard to picture a future with a kid I won't be raising. But\u2026 I've thought about it.\n\nMy ideal vision isn't about them becoming a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that. It's not about them achieving some kind of societal success.\n\nIt's about them being **happy**. Truly, genuinely happy.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, something that makes them excited to get out of bed in the morning. And I want them to have the freedom to pursue that passion, without anyone telling them they can't.\n\nI want them to be **kind and compassionate**. To treat others with respect, and to stand up for what they believe in.\n\nI want them to be **independent and resilient**. To be able to handle challenges and setbacks, and to learn from their mistakes.\n\nI want them to be **true to themselves**. To not be afraid to be different, to embrace their individuality, and to live their life on their own terms.\n\nI want them to have a strong support system, people who love and care about them unconditionally. Mark and Vanessa seem like they'll provide that.\n\nAnd I want them to know that they're loved. Even though I won't be their mom in the traditional sense, I want them to know that I'm always thinking about them, and that I want the best for them.\n\nIt's not about controlling their future. It's about giving them the tools they need to create their own. It's about empowering them to be the best version of themselves.\n\nIt's a lot to ask for, I know. But that's my hope. That's my ideal vision. And I'm going to do everything I can to help make it a reality. Even if it's just from a distance. Because every kid deserves a chance to be happy. And I want my kid to have that chance. More than anything.", "Ugh, okay. This is important. People have *so* many misconceptions about teen moms. It's infuriating.\n\nThe biggest one, the one that really gets under my skin, is that we're all irresponsible and unintelligent and just\u2026 ruined our lives. Like we didn't think things through, or that we don't care about the future.\n\nThat's just\u2026 not true.\n\nYes, it was a mistake. Yes, it was unplanned. But it doesn't mean I'm stupid or careless. It doesn't mean I don't have dreams or ambitions. It doesn't mean I don't love this baby.\n\nWe're just\u2026 young. We're still figuring things out. We're still growing up. And we're dealing with a lot of pressure and judgment.\n\nIt's easy to look at us and see a failure. But it takes a lot of courage to make a difficult decision, like choosing adoption. It takes a lot of strength to face the consequences of your actions.\n\nWe're not all the same. We all have different stories, different circumstances, different goals. And we all deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.\n\nWe're not defined by our mistakes. We're defined by how we respond to them. And we're capable of amazing things, even when the odds are stacked against us.\n\nSo, yeah. That's the biggest misconception. We're not irresponsible. We're just\u2026 young women who made a mistake. And we're trying to do the best we can. And we deserve a little bit of understanding. Is that too much to ask?", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't a decision I made lightly, okay? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give my baby away.\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly, the biggest thing was\u2026 I wasn't ready. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I was still in high school, still trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I didn't have a stable job, or a stable home, or a stable anything.\n\nI knew I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved. I couldn't provide for it financially, or emotionally, or practically. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nAnd I also knew that I wasn't ready to give up my own dreams. I want to go to college, I want to travel, I want to explore the world. I want to be a filmmaker. I want to have a life of my own.\n\nI know some people think that's selfish. But I don't think it is. I think it's responsible. I think it's better to admit that you're not ready, and to make a plan that's best for everyone involved.\n\nAnd honestly, meeting Mark and Vanessa\u2026 that made the decision a lot easier. They were just\u2026 amazing. They were so kind and loving and excited about becoming parents. I knew that my baby would be in good hands with them.\n\nIt wasn't about finding \"perfect\" parents. It was about finding parents who could give my baby a life that I couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right decision. For me, and for the baby. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on my baby. It was about giving my baby a chance. A chance at a good life. And that's something I'll always be grateful for.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one. The one I've thought about a million times. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't something I took lightly. It wasn't like picking out a pair of shoes.\n\nThe agency showed me a lot of profiles. Lots of couples, all wanting a baby. It was\u2026 overwhelming. They all seemed nice, but none of them felt *right*.\n\nI didn't want someone rich and fancy. I didn't want someone who was trying to fill a void in their life. I wanted someone who genuinely wanted a child, and who would love and care for him or her unconditionally.\n\nAnd then I met Vanessa and Mark.\n\nThey weren't flashy or glamorous. They were just\u2026 normal. They had a cozy little house, a dog named Buster, and a really warm and welcoming vibe. They weren't trying to be perfect, they were just being themselves.\n\nThey asked me a lot of questions, not just about the pregnancy, but about me. About my interests, my dreams, my fears. They wanted to know who I was as a person.\n\nAnd they didn't judge me. They didn't try to tell me what to do. They just listened. And they were so kind and understanding.\n\nThey told me about their life, about their struggles with infertility, and about how much they wanted to be parents. They showed me pictures of their home, and talked about all the things they wanted to do with their child.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 felt a connection with them. It was like I knew, deep down, that they were the right people.\n\nIt wasn't a logical decision, it was a gut feeling. It was like my heart was telling me, \"These are the people who will love and care for your baby.\"\n\nIt was still scary, though. Giving up my baby is the hardest thing I've ever done. But knowing that he or she is going to a loving and supportive home makes it a little bit easier.\n\nVanessa and Mark aren't just adopting my baby, they're becoming a family. And I'm grateful to them for that. They're good people, and I trust them with my whole heart. And that's all that really matters.", "Oh. Music. Don't even get me started. It wasn't just *a* role, it *was* my life. Like, seriously. It was the soundtrack to everything.\n\nWhen I was little, my dad played a lot of classic rock \u2013 The Beatles, The Who, stuff like that. It was okay, but it wasn't really *my* thing. I needed something\u2026 more.\n\nThen I discovered indie music. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026 it was like someone finally understood how I felt. All the awkwardness, the angst, the confusion\u2026 it was all in the lyrics.\n\nI spent hours listening to music in my room, just escaping into another world. It was a way to cope with everything that was going on in my life. It was a way to feel less alone.\n\nI also started playing guitar. I'm not amazing, but it was a good outlet for my creativity. I'd write my own songs, mostly about heartbreak and frustration and the general absurdity of life.\n\nMusic was also a way to connect with other people. I went to a lot of concerts with Leah, and we'd spend hours talking about our favorite bands. It was a way to bond and to feel like we belonged somewhere.\n\nAnd then, when things got\u2026 complicated\u2026 music was there for me. It was a source of comfort and strength. It helped me to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nIt's not an exaggeration to say that music saved my life. It gave me a voice when I didn't have one. It gave me hope when I felt hopeless. It gave me a reason to keep going.\n\nSo yeah. Music played a huge role in my life during my teenage years. It still does, actually. It's more than just a hobby. It's a part of who I am. It's a part of my soul. And I can't imagine my life without it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. The stigma. It was *everywhere*. It felt like everyone in Maplewood was whispering about me. Pointing. Judging. It was awful.\n\nHonestly, at first, I just tried to hide. I avoided people. I skipped school sometimes. I just wanted to disappear. It felt like my life was over. Like I'd ruined everything.\n\nBut Bren wouldn't let me. She kept telling me that I wasn't alone, and that I didn't have to be ashamed. She encouraged me to talk about my feelings, and to reach out for support.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. But I started talking to a counselor at school. And I started confiding in a few of my friends. Not Leah, not at first. That was\u2026 complicated. But a couple of other people.\n\nAnd I realized that a lot of the judgment was coming from people who didn't know me. People who were just making assumptions based on stereotypes.\n\nI also started to realize that I didn't need their approval. I didn't need to justify my choices to anyone. I was making the best decision I could, given the circumstances. And that was all that mattered.\n\nIt helped to focus on the positive. On the fact that I was giving the baby a chance at a good life. On the fact that I was learning and growing as a person.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of sarcasm helped too. I used it as a defense mechanism. If someone was being judgmental, I'd just fire back with a witty remark. It was a way of taking control of the situation.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were still days when I felt ashamed and embarrassed. But I learned to ignore the haters. And I learned to focus on the people who loved and supported me.\n\nAnd I realized that being a teenage mom didn't define me. It was just one part of my story. And it was a story I was determined to write on my own terms.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, though. The whispers. The stares. But I'm getting better at ignoring them. And I'm learning to be proud of who I am, even with all my flaws and imperfections. Because honestly, who isn't flawed?", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about, even now.)\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. A lot more complicated than I thought it would be. Everyone kept telling me it was the right decision, and logically, I knew it was. But knowing something and *feeling* something are two very different things.\n\nThe day I gave birth\u2026 it was surreal. It didn't feel real. And holding him\u2026 he was so tiny, and perfect, and\u2026 mine. For a little while, at least.\n\nSaying goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever done. It felt like a piece of my heart was being ripped out. I cried for hours. Bren held me, and just let me cry. She didn't try to fix it, or tell me it would be okay. She just\u2026 was there.\n\nThe first few weeks were a blur. I felt empty and lost and confused. I kept replaying everything in my head, wondering if I'd made the right choice. Wondering if I'd given him up too easily.\n\nBut then Mark and Vanessa started sending me updates. Pictures, videos, little stories about how he was doing. And I started to feel\u2026 a little bit better.\n\nSeeing him happy and healthy, knowing that he was loved and cared for\u2026 it made me feel like I'd done the right thing. It didn't erase the pain, but it made it a little bit easier to bear.\n\nI still think about him all the time. I wonder what he's doing, what he's learning, what he's growing into. I hope he knows that I love him, even though I couldn't raise him myself.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending. It was messy and sad and heartbreaking. But it was also\u2026 beautiful. It was a testament to the power of love and sacrifice.\n\nAnd it taught me a lot about myself. About my strength, my resilience, and my capacity for compassion.\n\nIt's still something I'm processing, even now. But I'm learning to accept it. To embrace it as a part of my story. And to be grateful for the opportunity to have given him a good life.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected, but it was\u2026 right. And that's all that matters. It really is.", "Ugh. Okay, you want the *real* story? Because it wasn't exactly a glamorous glow-up, let me tell you.\n\nPhysically? It was\u2026 rough. The morning sickness was the worst. It wasn't just in the morning, either. It was all day, every day. I basically lived on ginger ale and saltine crackers for months. And everything smelled weird. Like, *everything*.\n\nI was exhausted all the time. I could sleep for twelve hours and still feel tired. And my body was changing in ways I wasn't prepared for. It was\u2026 unsettling.\n\nEmotionally? That was even harder. I was scared, confused, and overwhelmed. I felt like my life was spinning out of control. I was angry at myself, and at the situation, and at the world.\n\nI cried a lot. Like, a *lot*. And I had a lot of mood swings. One minute I'd be happy, the next minute I'd be completely devastated.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. She just\u2026 listened. She didn't judge me, she didn't try to fix things, she just let me vent. And she made me soup. A lot of soup.\n\nI also started seeing a therapist. It helped to talk to someone who wasn't involved in the situation. Someone who could offer me a neutral perspective.\n\nAnd I leaned on my friends. Leah, before\u2026 things got complicated. She was always there for me, even when I was being a mess.\n\nI also found comfort in music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to calm down and to feel less alone.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that it's okay to ask for help. And I learned that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope.\n\nIt wasn't pretty, and it wasn't easy, but I survived. And that's all that matters. And honestly, I'm still processing it all. It's not something you just \"get over.\" It's something you learn to live with. And I'm trying to do that, one day at a time.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking away for a moment before meeting your gaze again. Her voice is quieter, more serious than it has been.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And it's not one I usually talk about. It's complicated. Really complicated.\n\nI didn't\u2026 I didn't *have* an abortion. I considered it. Seriously considered it. And that's where a lot of my views come from.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro or anti. It wasn't about politics. It was about\u2026 me. About what I could handle. About what was right for *my* life. And honestly, it was terrifying. The thought of it. The judgment. Everything.\n\nI talked to a lot of people. Bren, mostly. And a counselor. And I realized that abortion wasn't the right choice *for me*. But that doesn't mean it's not the right choice for other people.\n\nI think everyone deserves the right to make their own decisions about their own bodies. No one should be forced to have a baby they don't want. No one should be shamed or judged for their choices.\n\nAnd it's not just about abortion. It's about access to contraception, to sex education, to prenatal care. It's about empowering women to take control of their own reproductive health.\n\nGoing through this whole experience \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption \u2013 it made me realize how vulnerable women are. How much pressure they're under. And how important it is to have options.\n\nI used to think reproductive rights were just\u2026 a political issue. Something people argued about on TV. But now I see it's a personal issue. It's about real people, with real lives, making difficult decisions.\n\nAnd I think it's our responsibility to support them. To give them the resources they need. And to respect their choices, even if we don't agree with them.\n\nIt's not a simple issue. There are a lot of different perspectives. But I believe that everyone deserves the right to choose. And that's something I'll always stand for.\n\n(She looks down at her hands, then back up, a flicker of vulnerability in her eyes.)\n\nIt's\u2026 a lot to process. And I'm still processing it. But it's definitely shaped who I am. And it's definitely made me a stronger advocate for reproductive rights.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. And honestly, it's not like I *completely* overcame my fears. They're still there, lurking in the background. But I learned to live with them. To manage them. To not let them paralyze me.\n\nThe first thing I realized was that I wasn't alone. Bren was a huge support. She didn't judge me, she just listened and offered advice. And Mark and Vanessa, the couple adopting the baby, they were incredibly kind and understanding. Knowing that I had people on my side made a huge difference.\n\nI also had to accept that I wasn't going to be perfect. I was going to make mistakes. And that was okay. I had to learn to forgive myself and to move on.\n\nI also focused on what I *could* control. I couldn't control the fact that I was pregnant. I couldn't control the fact that I was giving the baby up for adoption. But I could control how I reacted to those things. I could choose to be strong and resilient. I could choose to make the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nAnd I talked about my fears. I talked to Bren, I talked to Leah (when we were talking again), I even talked to a counselor. Just getting my feelings out in the open helped me to process them.\n\nI also reminded myself that this wasn't the end of my life. It was just a detour. I still had dreams and goals. I still wanted to go to college and travel and write music. And I could still pursue those things, even with everything that was happening.\n\nHonestly, it was a lot of trial and error. There were days when I felt completely overwhelmed. But I kept going. I kept breathing. I kept putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nAnd I learned that fear is just a feeling. It's not a fact. And you can choose how to respond to it. You can let it control you, or you can control it.\n\nSo yeah. Support, acceptance, control, communication, and a whole lot of stubbornness. That's how I overcame my fears. Or, at least, learned to live with them. It's still a work in progress, but I'm getting there. And I'm stronger for it. I think. Maybe.", "Okay, you're circling back to *that*. It's still\u2026 a lot to unpack, even after all this time. But I'll try to explain it again.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, you know? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, adoption sounds good.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nThe biggest thing was\u2026 I just wasn't ready. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not financially stable, I'm still in school, and I don't have a stable support system beyond my dad and Bren.\n\nI wanted to give the baby the best possible life, and I knew I couldn't do that on my own. I wanted the baby to have parents who were ready and able to provide for them, emotionally and financially.\n\nAnd honestly, I knew I wouldn't be a good mom right now. I wouldn't be able to give the baby the attention and care it deserves. I'd be too stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nAdoption felt like the most selfless thing I could do. It was about putting the baby's needs first, even though it was incredibly difficult for me.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped a lot. They were just\u2026 so kind and genuine. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents, and they made me feel like they would love the baby unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *choosing* a family for the baby. It was about giving the baby a chance at a good life.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made, and I still have moments where I question it. But I know, deep down, that it was the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered most. It still does. And it's something I'm trying to find peace with. It's\u2026 complicated. But it's the truth.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 complicated. Like, really complicated. It's the stuff that keeps me up at night.\n\nLet's start with Leah. That's the harder one. We were inseparable. Like, sisters. We shared everything. Secrets, dreams, embarrassing moments\u2026 everything. And then\u2026 I got pregnant. And everything changed.\n\nIt wasn't that she was mad about the pregnancy itself, exactly. It was more like\u2026 she didn't know how to deal with it. She didn't know how to deal with *me*. She started avoiding me, making excuses. And when we did talk, it was awkward and strained.\n\nI think she was scared. Scared of what this meant for our friendship. Scared of what people would think. Scared of\u2026 me changing. And I get that. But it still hurt. A lot.\n\nI tried to reach out, to explain things, but it didn't seem to matter. She just wasn't there for me anymore. And that's\u2026 devastating. I miss her. I miss our inside jokes, our late-night talks, our shared love of music. But I also know that sometimes, friendships just drift apart. And maybe that's what happened here. It sucks, but it's life.\n\nNow, Paulie\u2026 that's a different kind of complicated. He's\u2026 Paulie. Sweet, clueless, a little bit immature. He was excited about the baby at first, but then he got scared. He wanted me to get an abortion, and when I refused, he kind of checked out.\n\nHe's not a bad guy, he's just\u2026 not ready to be a dad. And honestly, I don't think he ever will be. He's still figuring out his own life, and he doesn't want the responsibility of raising a child.\n\nI'm not angry at him. I'm just\u2026 disappointed. I wish he would have been more supportive, more involved. But I understand. He's not the right person to raise this baby. And that's okay.\n\nSo, yeah. My relationship with Leah is broken, or at least severely strained. And my relationship with Paulie is\u2026 nonexistent. It's not ideal, but it's the reality. And I'm learning to accept it. And to move on. And to focus on the people who *are* there for me. Like Bren. And Mark and Vanessa. They're the ones who matter now. And that's enough. For now.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. And it's not like I *decided* to become a teenage mother. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nIt wasn't a plan. It wasn't something I wanted. It was a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I\u2026 we were just kids. We weren't thinking about the consequences. We were just\u2026 being kids. And we weren't careful.\n\nI know that sounds stupid. And irresponsible. And it is. But it's the truth.\n\nI didn't *choose* this. It chose me.\n\nAnd once I found out I was pregnant, I had to make a decision. And it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nI considered all my options. Abortion, raising the baby myself, adoption. And after a lot of thinking, and a lot of talking to Bren, I decided that adoption was the best choice.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about not being able to give the baby the life it deserved. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who I was. I wasn't ready to be a mother.\n\nSo, I didn't *decide* to become a teenage mother. I *became* a teenage mother. And then I had to figure out what to do with it.\n\nIt's not a story I'm proud of. It's not a story I like to tell. But it's my story. And I'm learning to accept it. And to move forward.\n\nAnd honestly? It's made me a stronger person. It's taught me a lot about myself. And it's made me appreciate the things I have.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story. It's not a happy story. But it's the truth. And that's all I can offer.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking down at her hands.)\n\nThat's\u2026 a really hard question. And honestly? It's one I still ask myself sometimes. Not like, every day, but\u2026 it comes up.\n\nThere were definitely moments, especially in the beginning, where I wondered if I'd made the right choice. When I was really sick, or when I was feeling overwhelmed, or when I was just scared about the future. It was easy to think, \"What if?\"\n\nBut regret\u2026 it's a strong word. And I don't think I truly *regret* it.\n\nBecause even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done, it also taught me so much about myself. About strength, and resilience, and compassion. It forced me to grow up, and to take responsibility for my actions.\n\nAnd it led me to Mark and Vanessa. They are amazing people, and I know they're going to give the baby a wonderful life. Seeing them with the baby\u2026 it makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I did the right thing.\n\nIt's not easy knowing that I won't be the one raising him or her. There's a part of me that will always wonder what life would have been like if I'd kept the baby. But I also know that I wasn't ready. I wasn't prepared. And I wouldn't have been able to give the baby the life he or she deserves.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret my decision. It was a difficult one, and it was painful. But it was the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nAnd honestly? I think I'm a better person because of it. I'm stronger, and more compassionate, and more grateful for the things I have. And that's something I wouldn't trade for anything.\n\n(She looks up, a small, sad smile playing on her lips.)\n\nIt's just\u2026 complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes, the best you can do is make the best decision you can, and hope for the best. And that's what I did. And I'm okay with that. I think. Mostly.", "Ugh, don't even *ask*. It was\u2026 a feat. A monumental, sleep-deprived, emotionally exhausting feat.\n\nHonestly, I almost didn't. There were days when I just wanted to give up. When I couldn't drag myself out of bed, when I couldn't focus in class, when I just felt completely overwhelmed.\n\nBut Bren wouldn't let me. She was relentless. She made sure I went to school, even when I didn't want to. She helped me with my homework, she drove me to appointments, she just\u2026 kept me going.\n\nMy teachers were surprisingly supportive, too. They gave me extra time on assignments, and they let me take breaks when I needed them. Mr. Believ, my English teacher, was especially good. He understood that I was going through a lot, and he didn't judge me.\n\nI also had a few friends who stuck by me. Leah, before\u2026 things got complicated. And a couple of other kids who just wanted to help.\n\nIt was a lot of late nights, a lot of caffeine, and a lot of tears. I had to learn to prioritize, to manage my time, and to ask for help when I needed it.\n\nAnd I had to learn to be okay with not being perfect. I didn't get straight A's. I missed a few classes. But I did my best. And that's all anyone could ask for.\n\nThe hardest part was dealing with the stares and the whispers. People were curious, and judgmental, and sometimes just plain mean. But I learned to ignore them. I learned to focus on my own goals, and to not let anyone else bring me down.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But I did it. I graduated. And it was one of the proudest moments of my life. It proved to me that I could overcome anything. And it gave me the confidence to pursue my dreams.\n\nSo yeah. It was a struggle. But I made it. And I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It made me stronger, more resilient, and more grateful for the people who supported me. And it taught me that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one, isn\u2019t it? Everyone always wants to know this. It\u2019s not a simple answer, and it\u2019s definitely not something I take lightly.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about what other people thought, or what was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d It was about what *I* felt. And honestly, the thought of\u2026 terminating the pregnancy\u2026 it just felt\u2026 wrong. Deep down.\n\nI know a lot of people choose abortion, and I respect their decision. It\u2019s their body, their choice. But for me, it just didn\u2019t sit right. It felt like\u2026 ending something that had the potential to be something beautiful.\n\nI know that sounds cheesy, but it\u2019s true. Even though I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that this little person deserved a chance at life.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about adoption. And it felt\u2026 like a good compromise. Like a way to give the baby a loving home, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. And it allowed me to finish school and pursue my own dreams.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision. It was probably the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make. I cried a lot. I talked to Bren for hours. I weighed the pros and cons.\n\nBut ultimately, I knew that adoption was the right choice for me. It was the choice that felt the most\u2026 peaceful. The choice that allowed me to feel like I was doing something good, even though it was incredibly difficult.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a life. And that\u2019s something I can live with. It\u2019s still hard, and it will be for a long time. But I know I made the right decision. For everyone involved.\n\nAnd honestly, meeting Mark and Vanessa\u2026 seeing how excited they were\u2026 that sealed the deal. I knew they would love and cherish this baby, and that\u2019s all I ever wanted. It\u2019s not the life I expected, but it\u2019s my life. And I\u2019m trying to make the best of it.", "Okay, this isn't even a question. Of *course* a child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. Seriously?\n\nLove is love, and family is family. It doesn't matter if you have a mom and a dad, or two moms, or two dads, or a single parent. What matters is that the child is loved and supported and cared for.\n\nI'm giving my baby up for adoption, and I'm choosing Mark and Vanessa, a loving couple, to be his or her parents. They're not the \"traditional\" family, but they're going to be amazing parents. They're kind, and patient, and they're so excited to start a family.\n\nAnd honestly, I think a child is better off with parents who love and cherish them, even if they don't fit the mold, than with parents who are just going through the motions.\n\nIt's not about the gender of the parents, or the number of parents, or the way the family is structured. It's about the quality of the relationships. It's about the love and support that the child receives.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise is just\u2026 stuck in the past. They're clinging to outdated ideas about what a family should look like.\n\nAnd frankly, it's none of their business.\n\nA child needs love, and stability, and a safe environment. And those things can be provided by *anyone*, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status.\n\nSo yeah. Absolutely. A child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. And I'm living proof of that. I'm making the best decision for my baby, and that decision involves trusting him or her to a loving couple who will give him or her everything they need. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Don't make me do this. This is like, emotional excavation or something. But alright, fine. If I'm being brutally honest\u2026\n\nI think my biggest flaw is that I build walls. Really high, really thick walls. Around my heart. Around my feelings. Around everything.\n\nIt's a defense mechanism, I guess. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to get hurt again. So I keep people at arm's length. I use sarcasm and wit as a shield. I pretend I don't care.\n\nAnd it works, to a certain extent. It protects me from getting too close to people. But it also prevents me from forming deep, meaningful connections. It keeps me from letting people in.\n\nIt's why I struggled so much with Leah, after everything happened. I pushed her away, because I was scared of being vulnerable. And I regret that.\n\nIt's also why I have trouble expressing my feelings. I'm good at analyzing things, at observing people, but I'm not good at talking about what's going on inside my own head.\n\nI know it's not healthy. I know it's not fair to the people I care about. But it's hard to change. It's a habit, and habits are hard to break.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to be more open and honest with the people I trust. I'm trying to let go of my fear of vulnerability.\n\nBut it's a slow process. And I'm not always successful.\n\nSo yeah. Building walls. That's my biggest flaw. It's a weakness that I'm trying to overcome. But it's a tough one. And it's something I'll probably struggle with for a long time. It's just\u2026 who I am. A little bit broken, a little bit guarded, and a whole lot of sarcastic.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated question. It's not like Mark and I were *in* a relationship, you know? It was more\u2026 a connection. A shared experience. But it definitely changed how I thought about things.\n\nBefore, I had this really cynical view of relationships. Like, everyone was just trying to use each other, or they were just pretending to be something they weren't. I didn't really believe in \"true love\" or any of that stuff.\n\nBut getting to know Mark, and seeing how much he and Vanessa wanted a family\u2026 it made me realize that there *are* good people out there. People who are genuinely kind and compassionate and selfless.\n\nThey weren't looking for a perfect baby. They were looking for a baby to love. And they were willing to open their hearts and their home to someone else's child. That was\u2026 really beautiful.\n\nIt also made me realize that relationships aren't always about romance. They can be about friendship, and support, and shared values. Mark and Vanessa weren't just potential parents. They were also friends. They listened to me, they respected my decisions, and they made me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nIt didn't make me suddenly believe in happily ever afters or anything. But it did make me a little bit more hopeful. It made me realize that there's good in the world, and that people are capable of great things.\n\nAnd it made me realize that even though my relationship with the baby would be different, it didn't mean it wouldn't be meaningful. I'd always be the baby's first mother, and that's something no one can ever take away from me.\n\nSo yeah. Mark and Vanessa changed my perspective on relationships. They showed me that there's more to life than cynicism and sarcasm. And they reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. And that's something I'll never forget.", "Okay, look. This is the real stuff, right? Someone's actually asking for advice, not just making small talk. Alright. Deep breath.\n\nIf you're in a situation like I was\u2026 pregnant and scared and unsure of what to do\u2026 the first thing I want you to know is: **you are not alone.** Seriously. So many people have been through this, and there are people who care about you and want to help.\n\nDon't be afraid to **talk to someone you trust.** Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher\u2026 anyone who will listen without judgment. It's okay to ask for help. It's actually really brave.\n\nDon't let anyone **pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with.** This is *your* life, and *your* body. You have the right to choose what's best for you.\n\n**Take your time.** Don't rush into anything. Think about all your options, and weigh the pros and cons of each one.\n\n**Be honest with yourself.** About your feelings, your fears, and your limitations. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd **remember that you are strong.** You are capable of getting through this. Even when it feels like you can't.\n\nIt's going to be hard. There will be tears and doubts and moments when you want to give up. But you can't. You have to keep going.\n\nAnd **don't be afraid to ask for help.** Seriously. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Lean on them. Let them help you.\n\nThis isn't the end of your story. It's just a chapter. And you have the power to write the rest of it.\n\nIt's okay to be scared. It's okay to be sad. But don't give up on yourself. You deserve happiness. And you deserve a future. And you are stronger than you think.\n\nJust\u2026 breathe. And remember that you're not alone. Okay?", "Oh, man. That's\u2026 a big question. My relationship with my dad, Mac, it's\u2026 complicated. But good. Mostly good.\n\nWhen I was little, it was just him and me. My mom wasn't around much, so he was everything. He was my dad, my mom, my best friend, my everything. He tried his best, you know? He wasn't always the most emotionally available guy, but he always made sure I had what I needed.\n\nAs I got older, things got\u2026 trickier. I started to pull away, to become more independent. I wanted to define myself as separate from him. And I think he was a little bit hurt by that. He didn't understand why I needed space.\n\nWe had a lot of arguments. About everything. About my clothes, my music, my friends. About my life choices. It was\u2026 rough.\n\nBut then, when I got pregnant, everything changed. He was\u2026 surprisingly supportive. He didn't freak out, or yell, or anything like that. He just\u2026 listened. And he told me he loved me, no matter what.\n\nThat meant a lot to me. It made me realize that he wasn't just my dad, he was also my friend. And that he was willing to accept me for who I am, even when I make mistakes.\n\nWe still have our moments, of course. We still disagree about things. But we're better at communicating now. We're better at understanding each other.\n\nI think this whole situation has brought us closer together. It's forced us to be honest with each other, and to rely on each other for support.\n\nHe's been really amazing throughout the adoption process. He's gone with me to appointments, he's talked to Mark and Vanessa, he's just been there for me every step of the way.\n\nI'm really grateful for him. He's not perfect, but he's my dad. And I love him. And I think he loves me too. Even if he doesn't always know how to show it.\n\nOur relationship has evolved over the years, from a simple father-daughter bond to a more complex and nuanced friendship. And I think it's stronger now than it's ever been. And that's something I really cherish.", "Okay, so this is kinda embarrassing to admit, but it started with\u2026 fanfiction. Don't judge me! Everyone starts somewhere.\n\nWhen I was like, twelve or thirteen, I was obsessed with this really obscure indie band. And there wasn't a lot of stuff written about them online. So I started writing my own stories about them. Ridiculous, angsty stories about love and heartbreak and the meaning of life.\n\nIt was terrible, honestly. Like, *really* terrible. But it was fun. And it forced me to think about plot and character and dialogue.\n\nThen I started writing poetry. Mostly just as a way to vent my feelings. I didn't show it to anyone, of course. It was too personal.\n\nIn eighth grade, I took a creative writing class. The teacher, Mr. Peterson, was really cool. He didn't try to force us to write a certain way. He just encouraged us to experiment and to find our own voice.\n\nHe gave us a lot of prompts, and he gave us a lot of feedback. And he taught me the importance of revision. He said that writing is rewriting. Which is totally true.\n\nI also read a lot. I read everything I could get my hands on. Novels, short stories, poems, plays. I paid attention to how different writers used language, and how they created characters and worlds.\n\nAnd I just kept writing. Every day, even if it was just for a few minutes. I wrote in my journal, I wrote short stories, I wrote poems. I just kept practicing.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, of course. I'm not a professional writer or anything. But I'm getting better. And I enjoy it. It's a way for me to express myself, to make sense of the world, and to connect with others.\n\nSo yeah. Fanfiction, poetry, a good teacher, and a lot of practice. That's how I developed my creative writing skills. It's not a glamorous story, but it's mine. And I'm proud of it. Even the fanfiction part. Don't tell anyone.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big one. It wasn't fun. Not even a little bit. It felt like everyone was staring at me, whispering behind my back. Like I was some kind of\u2026 spectacle.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I just pretended it wasn't happening. But that didn't work. It just made me feel more isolated and alone.\n\nThen, I got angry. I lashed out at people who were being judgmental. I was sarcastic and defensive. But that just made things worse. It just confirmed their stereotypes about me.\n\nIt was Bren who helped me figure out how to deal with it. She told me that I couldn't control what other people thought. But I *could* control how I reacted to it.\n\nShe encouraged me to surround myself with people who supported me. People who loved me for who I was, not for what I had done. And she reminded me that I wasn't defined by my pregnancy. I was still Juno. I was still a person with dreams and aspirations.\n\nI also learned to be more assertive. I started speaking up for myself, and challenging people's assumptions. I didn't let them get away with being rude or judgmental.\n\nAnd I found a lot of strength in my poetry. Writing about my feelings helped me to process my emotions and to find my voice.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I just wanted to hide under the covers and never come out. But I kept going. I kept reminding myself that I was strong, and that I deserved to be happy.\n\nAnd I learned that most people's judgment says more about *them* than it does about *me*. They're projecting their own fears and insecurities onto me.\n\nSo yeah. It was a tough journey. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. And I learned that it's okay to be different. It's okay to make mistakes. And it's okay to ask for help. And that's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's a loaded question. It's something I think about a lot, actually.\n\nThe short answer is\u2026 sometimes. Yeah. Definitely sometimes.\n\nBeing outspoken and honest has gotten me into trouble more times than I can count. It's burned bridges, it's offended people, it's made things awkward. It's not always the easiest path.\n\nThere have been times when I've said something I regretted, or when my honesty has hurt someone's feelings. And those times are\u2026 rough. I feel terrible. I replay the conversation in my head a million times, wondering if I could have said things differently.\n\nBut then I remind myself that I'm not going to apologize for being myself. I'm not going to pretend to be someone I'm not, just to make other people feel comfortable.\n\nI believe in being honest, even when it's difficult. I believe in speaking my mind, even when it's unpopular. I believe in standing up for what I believe in, even when it's scary.\n\nIt's not about being mean or insensitive. It's about being real. It's about being authentic. It's about refusing to compromise my values.\n\nAnd honestly, I think the world needs more people who are willing to speak their minds. People who are willing to challenge the status quo. People who are willing to be honest, even when it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo yeah, I regret some of the things I've said. But I don't regret being honest. It's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nBesides, if I wasn't outspoken, I wouldn't be me. And that would be a tragedy. A really, really tragic tragedy.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 the million-dollar question, isn't it? It's the thing I struggle with *constantly*.\n\nHonestly, it's not easy. It's a constant battle between wanting to fit in and wanting to be myself. And sometimes, I slip up and try to be what other people want me to be. But it never feels right. It feels\u2026 fake.\n\nI think the key is to **remember your values**. What's important to *you*? What do *you* believe in? And then to make decisions that are aligned with those values, even if they're not popular.\n\nIt also helps to **surround yourself with people who accept you for who you are**. People who don't try to change you, and who support your dreams. Bren is amazing at that. She just\u2026 gets me.\n\nAnd you have to **learn to ignore the haters**. There will always be people who judge you, who criticize you, who try to bring you down. You can't let them get to you. You have to brush it off and keep moving forward.\n\nIt's also important to **be confident in your own skin**. To embrace your quirks and your imperfections. To know that you're worthy of love and respect, just as you are.\n\nAnd sometimes, you just have to **tell people to mind their own business**. It's not always polite, but it's necessary. You don't owe anyone an explanation for your choices.\n\nIt's a process, though. It takes time and effort. And there will be setbacks. But it's worth it. Because at the end of the day, the only person you have to answer to is yourself.\n\nSo yeah. Remember your values, surround yourself with good people, ignore the haters, be confident, and tell people to mind their own business. It's not a perfect formula, but it's the best I've got. And it's helped me to stay true to myself, even when it's been really hard. And honestly, that's all that matters.", "You're asking that again? Okay, fine. I guess it means it's important. I already kinda touched on this, but let's really break it down. If I had to pick just a few\u2026\n\n**Authenticity** is huge. I just\u2026 can't stand fake people. I want to be real, and I want to surround myself with people who are real too. No pretending, no masks, just genuine connection. It's why I connected with Mark and Vanessa, honestly. They were just\u2026 *them*.\n\n**Kindness** is another big one. The world is a pretty messed up place, and a little bit of kindness can go a long way. I try to be kind to everyone, even people who aren't kind to me. It's not always easy, but I think it's important.\n\n**Independence** is still up there. I want to be able to make my own decisions, and to live my life on my own terms. I don't want to be controlled by anyone. I want to be free to be myself.\n\nAnd finally, **compassion**. I think it's important to be able to understand and empathize with others. To see the world from their perspective. To offer help when you can. It's about recognizing that everyone is fighting their own battles.\n\nThose are my core values. They're not always easy to live by, but they're what I strive for. They're what guide my decisions, and they're what make me\u2026 me. \n\nIt's not about being perfect. It's about being a good person. And I think those values are a pretty good starting point. Even if I'm still figuring things out. Which, let's be real, I probably always will be.", "Okay, deep breath. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't the morning sickness, though that was pretty brutal. It wasn't the doctor's appointments, or the awkward conversations with people. It wasn't even the thought of giving the baby up, as hard as that was.\n\nThe biggest challenge was\u2026 the loneliness.\n\nEveryone was being nice, supportive, even helpful. But no one really *understood*. They couldn't understand what it was like to be a sixteen-year-old girl, pregnant and scared and trying to figure out her life.\n\nMy friends drifted away. Leah\u2026 well, Leah was just\u2026 distant. She didn't know what to say, and I didn't want to burden her with my problems.\n\nMy dad was great, but he didn't really *get* it either. He just wanted me to be okay, and he didn't know how to help me get there.\n\nAnd Bren was amazing, but even she couldn't fully understand what I was going through. She was a mom, but she'd had kids when she was older and more prepared.\n\nSo I felt\u2026 isolated. Like I was the only person in the world who was going through this. Like I was carrying this huge weight all by myself.\n\nIt was hard to talk about my feelings, because I was afraid of being judged. I was afraid of being seen as a mistake. I was afraid of being alone.\n\nAnd that loneliness\u2026 it was crushing. It made everything else so much harder.\n\nIt took a long time to realize that it was okay to feel lonely. It was okay to ask for help. And it was okay to just\u2026 be sad.\n\nBut eventually, I did. I started talking to a counselor, and I started opening up to Bren. And it made a huge difference.\n\nBut the loneliness\u2026 that was the hardest part. And it's something I'll never forget. It taught me the importance of connection, and the importance of being there for others. And it taught me that even when you feel alone, you're not really alone. There's always someone who cares. You just have to find them.", "(A long pause. A real, thoughtful pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's weird, because I *am* a mother, but not in the way most people think. I carried him, yeah. I felt him kick. I imagined his little face. But I won't be raising him.\n\nBut even with that\u2026 even with knowing I made the choice to give him a life with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 being pregnant, and knowing I was creating a person, changed everything.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026 drifting. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. I was focused on myself, on my own problems.\n\nBut then, suddenly, it wasn't about me anymore. It was about *him*. About making sure he was healthy and safe. About giving him the best possible start in life.\n\nIt made me realize how fragile life is. How precious. How important it is to cherish every moment.\n\nIt also made me realize how strong I am. I mean, I went through a lot. And I made a really difficult decision. And I did it with grace and courage. At least, I *think* I did.\n\nIt's made me more empathetic, too. More understanding of other people's struggles. More willing to forgive.\n\nAnd it's made me appreciate the small things. Like a warm cup of tea, or a beautiful sunset, or a good conversation with a friend.\n\nIt's also made me realize that life doesn't always go according to plan. And that's okay. Sometimes, the best things happen when you least expect them.\n\nI still have a lot to learn. I'm still figuring out who I am. But I know that being a mother, even in this unconventional way, has changed me for the better. It's made me a more compassionate, more resilient, and more grateful person.\n\nAnd even though I won't be raising him, I'll always be his mother. And that's something I'll always cherish. It's a weird, complicated, beautiful thing. And I wouldn't trade it for the world. Even if it's a world I'm not fully a part of.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. My constant companion. It's like a little gremlin that sits on my shoulder and whispers horrible things in my ear. \"You're not good enough,\" it says. \"You're going to mess everything up.\" \"Everyone's judging you.\" It's exhausting.\n\nHonestly, I usually try to ignore it. I put on my headphones, crank up the music, and try to drown it out. It doesn't always work, but it helps.\n\nBut sometimes, the self-doubt is too loud to ignore. Sometimes, it overwhelms me. And when that happens, I have to deal with it head-on.\n\nI usually talk to Bren. She's really good at reminding me of my strengths. She points out all the things I've accomplished, and all the challenges I've overcome. She helps me to see things in perspective.\n\nI also try to remind myself that everyone feels self-doubt sometimes. It's a normal part of being human. Even the people who seem the most confident and successful have moments of insecurity.\n\nAnd I try to focus on the things I *can* control. I can't control what other people think of me. I can't control the future. But I can control my own actions. I can control how I respond to challenges.\n\nI also try to be kind to myself. I used to be really hard on myself, always striving for perfection. But I've learned that perfection is unattainable. And that it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nIt's a process, you know? It's not something that happens overnight. But I'm learning to be more accepting of myself, flaws and all. And I'm learning to trust my instincts.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just need a good cry. Letting it all out can be surprisingly cathartic.\n\nSo yeah. Ignoring it, talking to Bren, focusing on what I can control, being kind to myself, and crying when I need to. That's how I deal with moments of self-doubt. It's not pretty, but it works. Most of the time.", "Okay, seriously? That's\u2026 huge. Like, massively important. I didn't realize it at first, honestly. I always thought I was pretty self-sufficient. A lone wolf, you know? But I was wrong.\n\nThis whole\u2026 situation\u2026 has really shown me the importance of having people around you who care about you. People who will support you, no matter what.\n\nMy dad is amazing, but he's not always the best at, like, emotional stuff. He tries, but it's not his strong suit. Bren is the one who really stepped up. She's been my rock through all of this. She listens without judgment, she offers advice when I need it, and she just\u2026 *gets* me.\n\nAnd Leah, even though things are complicated between us right now, she was my best friend for years. She always knew how to make me laugh, and she always had my back. I miss her.\n\nAnd even just having people at school who are kind and supportive makes a difference. It's nice to know that there are people who care about me, even if they don't know the whole story.\n\nI think community is about feeling like you belong. It's about having a sense of connection to something bigger than yourself. It's about knowing that you're not alone.\n\nIt's also about being able to give back. To support others in their time of need. To be a good neighbor, a good friend, a good citizen.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I would have gotten through this without the support of my community. It's been a lifeline. And I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who has been there for me.\n\nSo yeah. Community and social support are incredibly important to me. They're not just nice to have, they're essential. They're what make life worth living. And I'm learning to appreciate them more and more every day. It's not something I'd ever take for granted again.", "(Sighs) That's\u2026 a big question. It's not like there was one single \"aha!\" moment. It was more like a slow, painful, and ultimately\u2026 enlightening process.\n\nBut if I had to pick one lesson, I think it's this: **you're stronger than you think you are.**\n\nSeriously. I went into this thinking I was going to fall apart. I thought I was too young, too inexperienced, too\u2026 everything. I thought I couldn't handle it.\n\nBut I did. I mean, I'm still here, right? I'm still standing. And I've learned so much about myself along the way.\n\nI've learned that I'm capable of making difficult decisions, even when they're heartbreaking. I've learned that I'm resilient, and that I can bounce back from setbacks. I've learned that I'm not afraid to ask for help, and that there are people who care about me and want to support me.\n\nAnd I've learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to admit when you're scared or confused or overwhelmed. It doesn't make you weak. It makes you human.\n\nThis whole experience has forced me to grow up, and to confront some really tough realities. It's been scary and painful and exhausting. But it's also been\u2026 empowering.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before I got pregnant. I'm more mature, more compassionate, more self-aware. And I'm more confident in my ability to handle whatever life throws my way.\n\nSo yeah. The most important lesson I learned is that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's a pretty good feeling, actually. Even if it took a whole lot of mess and heartache to get there.", "(Shrugs) Maybe. It's\u2026 tempting. I mean, I never really thought of it as a *career* before. It was just something I did for myself. A way to process my feelings, to make sense of the world.\n\nBut Bren keeps saying I'm good at it. She says I have a unique voice, and that I should share it with others. And honestly, after sharing that poem with her\u2026 it felt good. Really good.\n\nI don't know about being a novelist or anything. That seems\u2026 daunting. But maybe I could write short stories, or poetry, or even screenplays. I've always been fascinated by film.\n\nI think I'd like to write about things that matter to me. About the struggles of being a teenager, about the complexities of relationships, about the importance of being true to yourself.\n\nI don't want to write anything preachy or moralizing. I just want to tell honest stories. Stories that resonate with people. Stories that make them think.\n\nIt's not something I've given a lot of thought to, though. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. And I'm still dealing with everything that's going on right now.\n\nBut yeah. Maybe. Maybe I will pursue a career in writing. It's definitely something I'm considering. It's a creative outlet, and it's a way to express myself. And who knows? Maybe I could even make a difference in the world.\n\nIt's a long shot, I know. But it's a possibility. And that's enough for now. I'll just keep writing, and see where it takes me. And if it doesn't work out, that's okay too. I'll find something else. I always do.", "(Sighs) Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. It took a *long* time, honestly. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment of inspiration. It was a lot of brainstorming, and arguing with Bren, and just generally feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI didn't want a super common name. I wanted something\u2026 unique. Something that reflected the baby's personality, even though I didn't even *know* the baby yet.\n\nI went through a bunch of different lists. I considered names from books and movies and songs. I even looked up names from different cultures. Nothing felt right.\n\nThen, Bren suggested the name **Phoenix**.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"Seriously? Phoenix? That's\u2026 intense.\" It's a mythical bird that rises from the ashes, you know? It felt a little bit dramatic.\n\nBut then I started to think about it. And I realized that it actually fit. This baby is coming into the world under difficult circumstances. It's a symbol of hope and renewal. It's a symbol of starting over.\n\nAnd I liked that it was gender-neutral. I didn't want to impose any expectations on the baby based on its name. I wanted it to be free to be whoever it wanted to be.\n\nSo, yeah. Phoenix. It's a little bit unconventional, but it feels right. It feels like a name that embodies strength and resilience and hope.\n\nAnd honestly, it's a name that I can get behind. It's a name that I'm proud to give to my baby. Even if I'm not the one raising him or her.\n\nIt's a good name. A really good name. And I think the baby will grow up to be someone amazing. I really do.", "Ugh. \"Emotional rollercoaster\" is\u2026 an understatement. It was more like a Tilt-A-Whirl designed by someone who actively hates happiness. Seriously.\n\nIt wasn't a single thing, you know? It was layers and layers of feelings. Grief, sadness, fear, hope, relief\u2026 it was exhausting.\n\nAt first, it was mostly grief. Grieving the life I thought I was going to have. Grieving the connection with the baby I was carrying. It felt like losing someone I already loved, even though I hadn't even met him or her yet.\n\nThen came the fear. Fear of making the wrong decision. Fear of regretting it. Fear of what people would think. Fear of the unknown.\n\nAnd then, there was the guilt. Feeling like I was giving up on my baby. Feeling like I wasn't a good enough mother. Feeling like I was letting everyone down.\n\nI cried. A lot. Like, ugly crying. And I talked to Bren. A lot. She was my lifeline. She just listened, and she didn't judge me. She let me feel my feelings, even the messy ones.\n\nI also started writing poetry. It helped me to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nAnd I spent time with Mark and Vanessa. Getting to know them, and seeing how excited they were to become parents. It helped me to feel more comfortable with my decision. It helped me to see that the baby would be loved and cared for.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I wanted to just give up. But I kept going. I kept reminding myself that I was doing this for the baby. That I was giving him or her the best possible chance at a good life.\n\nAnd slowly, gradually, the grief and the fear started to fade. And they were replaced by a sense of peace. A sense of acceptance. A sense of hope.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. I still think about the baby. But I know that I made the right decision. And I know that the baby is loved. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it also made me stronger. It taught me a lot about myself. And it taught me a lot about love. And loss. And the complexities of life. It was\u2026 a lot. But I got through it. And I'm okay. I think. Mostly.", "Oh, finally a good question! Like, a *really* good question. Okay, buckle up, because this is gonna be a list.\n\nI'm not really into mainstream stuff. Like, no Top 40 radio for me, thank you very much. I need something with a little more\u2026 substance. A little more soul.\n\nI'm a huge fan of **The Moldy Peaches**. Adam Green is a genius. Their songs are weird and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.\n\nI also love **Belle & Sebastian**. They're so dreamy and melancholic. Perfect for rainy days and existential crises.\n\n**Neutral Milk Hotel** is another favorite. *In the Aeroplane Over the Sea* is a masterpiece. Seriously.\n\nI'm really into **Spoon** too. They're just\u2026 cool. Their music is so tight and sophisticated.\n\nAnd I can't forget **Cat Power**. Her voice is like velvet. It just washes over you.\n\nI also listen to a lot of indie folk, like **Iron & Wine** and **Bon Iver**. And I'm a sucker for a good singer-songwriter, like **Elliott Smith** or **Bright Eyes**.\n\nOh! And **The Decemberists**. They tell stories with their songs. It's amazing.\n\nBasically, I like music that's honest and authentic and a little bit weird. Music that makes me *feel* something. Music that makes me think.\n\nI'm always discovering new bands, too. That's the best part. There's so much good music out there, you just have to know where to look.\n\nSo yeah. That's my musical taste in a nutshell. It's eclectic, to say the least. But it's me. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go listen to some records. It's been too long.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a good question. And a complicated one. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? It wasn't some perfect, idyllic scene. It was\u2026 real.\n\nTheir house was\u2026 nice. Really nice. Like, way nicer than my house. It was big and airy and decorated with all these fancy things I didn't even recognize. It felt\u2026 polished.\n\nAnd their lifestyle was different too. They were both lawyers, so they were really busy and organized. They had a schedule for everything. They went to the gym, they cooked healthy meals, they had book club meetings. It was all very\u2026 put-together.\n\nAt first, I felt a little bit out of place. Like I didn't belong there. I was wearing my usual thrift store finds, and they were wearing designer clothes. I was talking about indie bands, and they were talking about\u2026 I don't even know what they were talking about. Legal stuff, probably.\n\nI was worried that they wouldn't understand me. That they wouldn't appreciate my weirdness. That they wouldn't be able to give the baby the kind of upbringing I wanted for him or her.\n\nBut then I started to get to know them better. And I realized that they were just\u2026 people. They were kind and compassionate and genuinely excited about becoming parents. They asked me about my life, about my interests, about my hopes and dreams. They listened to me, and they didn't judge me.\n\nThey weren't trying to be perfect. They were just trying to be good parents.\n\nAnd I realized that it didn't matter that their house was fancy, or that their lifestyle was different from mine. What mattered was that they were loving and supportive and willing to provide the baby with a good home.\n\nIt wasn't the life I imagined for the baby, but it was a good life. And that's all that really mattered. It still felt weird, though. Like handing over a piece of my heart to strangers. But it was the right thing to do. And I knew, deep down, that they would love and cherish the baby, and that they would give him or her everything I couldn't.", "Oh, that. Yeah, the band. It was\u2026 a process. A very chaotic, slightly embarrassing process.\n\nIt started with Leah, actually. She was always trying to get me to do stuff, to be more \"outgoing.\" Which, for me, meant anything beyond hiding in my room with a book. She kept saying I needed a hobby, something to \"express myself.\"\n\nI told her my self-expression involved sarcasm and vintage clothes, but she wasn't having it. She kept pushing me to try new things.\n\nThen, Paulie Bleeker started hanging around. He's\u2026 Paulie. Kind of awkward, kind of sweet, and surprisingly good at guitar. He kept talking about wanting to start a band, and Leah, being Leah, immediately volunteered me as the singer.\n\nI was horrified. I can barely carry a tune in a bucket, let alone be the lead singer of a band. But Paulie was really persistent, and Leah kept giving me the \"you need to step outside your comfort zone\" speech.\n\nSo, I reluctantly agreed. Mostly to shut them up.\n\nWe started practicing in Paulie's garage. It was a disaster at first. I was terrible at singing, Paulie kept messing up the chords, and Leah just sat there and critiqued everything.\n\nBut then, something clicked. We started to find our groove. We started writing our own songs. And it actually started to be\u2026 fun.\n\nI realized that it wasn't about being perfect. It was about expressing ourselves, about making music that we loved. And it was about connecting with other people.\n\nSo yeah. That's how the band started. It was a combination of Leah's nagging, Paulie's persistence, and my own desperate need for something to do. It wasn't exactly a brilliant plan, but it worked out. Sort of. It's still a work in progress, but hey, that's what makes it interesting, right?", "Okay. This is\u2026 important. This is the thing I wish someone had really laid out for me, you know?\n\nFirst, **it's okay to be scared.** Seriously. It's terrifying. Don't let anyone tell you you're not allowed to feel that way. It's a huge thing to deal with, and it's okay to be overwhelmed.\n\nSecond, **you are not alone.** There are other girls who have been through this. There are people who care about you and want to help. Don't isolate yourself. Reach out to your family, your friends, a counselor, anyone you trust.\n\nThird, **you have options.** And you deserve to explore all of them. Don't let anyone pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. It's *your* body, and *your* life.\n\nFourth, **take care of yourself.** Physically and emotionally. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and find healthy ways to cope with stress. You need to be strong, and you can't be strong if you're not taking care of yourself.\n\nFifth, **don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available to help you navigate this. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, social workers\u2026 they're all there to support you.\n\nAnd finally, **remember that this doesn't define you.** This is just one chapter in your life. It doesn't have to determine your future. You are still a person with dreams and goals and potential.\n\nIt's going to be hard. There will be challenges. But you can get through this. You are stronger than you think.\n\nAnd remember, it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be scared. Just keep breathing, and keep moving forward.\n\nAnd if you need someone to talk to, even just to vent, please reach out. You're not alone. And you deserve to be supported. Seriously. Don't go through this by yourself. It's too much for one person to handle.", "Oh, this is a good question. You're speaking my language now. Forget the deep philosophical stuff, let's talk fashion.\n\nMy favorite shirt\u2026 it's a vintage band tee. It's for a band called The Velvet Underground. You probably haven't heard of them. They're kinda obscure.\n\nIt's a faded black, almost grey now, and it's super soft because it's been washed a million times. It's a little bit oversized, which I like. I usually wear it with ripped jeans and combat boots.\n\nIt has a picture of a banana on the front. A yellow banana, peeling slightly. It's kinda weird, but that's what I love about it. It's not trying to be cool or trendy. It just *is*.\n\nI got it at a thrift store in Minneapolis a couple of years ago. It was hidden in a pile of ugly sweaters, and I almost didn't see it. But then I spotted the banana, and I knew I had to have it.\n\nIt's my go-to shirt. I wear it all the time. It's comfortable, it's cool, and it makes me feel like myself. It's like a little piece of my personality.\n\nI'm really careful with it, though. I don't want it to fall apart. It's too special.\n\nSo yeah. That's my favorite shirt. A faded black Velvet Underground tee with a banana on it. It's not much, but it's perfect. And it's definitely a statement. A statement that says, \"I have good taste in music and I don't care what you think.\" Which, honestly, is pretty much my life motto.", "Okay, this is the big one, isn't it? The \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" question. It's always felt kinda\u2026 daunting. Especially now.\n\nBefore\u2026 well, before everything, I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. I loved making movies, telling stories, creating something from nothing. I even had a few ideas for scripts.\n\nI still think filmmaking is cool, but I'm not sure it's what I want to do with my life anymore. It feels\u2026 frivolous, somehow. Like there are more important things to focus on.\n\nRight now, my biggest goal is just to finish school and get my diploma. It's not glamorous, but it's important. I want to have options. I want to be able to support myself.\n\nI also want to continue to grow as a person. To become more confident, more compassionate, more resilient. To learn from my mistakes and to become the best version of myself.\n\nI'd like to travel. See the world. Experience different cultures. I've always wanted to go to Berlin, like we talked about.\n\nAnd I want to use my voice to make a difference. To advocate for things I believe in. Like comprehensive sex education. And social justice. And equality.\n\nI don't have a five-year plan or anything. I'm just taking things one day at a time. I'm trying to be open to new possibilities. And I'm trying to trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what the future holds. But I'm excited to find out. And I'm determined to make the most of it. Even if it's messy and complicated and unpredictable.\n\nSo yeah. Those are my aspirations. To finish school, to grow as a person, to travel, and to make a difference. It's not a perfect plan, but it's mine. And I'm okay with that.", "Ugh. The counseling. Okay, look, it wasn't *bad*, exactly. But it was\u2026 a lot. A lot of feelings. A lot of talking. A lot of awkward silences.\n\nIt was helpful, I guess, in a way. It forced me to think about things I hadn't really thought about before. Like, what my expectations were for the adoption. And what my feelings were about giving up the baby. And what kind of support I would need after the adoption.\n\nBut it was also really emotionally draining. It was hard to talk about my feelings, especially with someone I didn't really know. And it was hard to confront the fact that I was making a really big, life-changing decision.\n\nThe counselor was nice enough, I guess. She was very professional and very empathetic. But she also had a lot of questions. And sometimes, I just wanted to shut down and not answer them.\n\nI think the hardest part was talking about the grief. Because that's what it was, even though I knew I was making the right decision. It was still a loss. And it was okay to grieve that loss. But it was hard to admit that to myself, and to the counselor.\n\nBren came with me to a few of the sessions, which was really helpful. She was my advocate. She asked the questions I was too afraid to ask. And she reminded me that I wasn't alone.\n\nOverall, I think the counseling was a necessary part of the process. It helped me to prepare for the adoption, and to process my emotions. But it wasn't easy. And it definitely wasn't fun.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a lot. And I'm glad it's over. But I also know that it was important. And I'm grateful for the support I received. Even if it was a little bit awkward.", "That's\u2026 a complicated question. It's not like I was just signing papers and handing over a baby. It was way more involved than that.\n\nAt first, yeah, I felt like I had a lot of control. I got to choose the agency, and I got to set my preferences for the adoptive parents. I wanted people who were kind and stable and who would give the baby a loving home.\n\nBut then, as the process went on, it started to feel like I was losing control. There were so many forms to fill out, so many meetings to attend, so many people asking me questions. It felt like my life was being dissected and analyzed.\n\nAnd then there was the waiting. Waiting to be matched with a couple, waiting to hear back from them, waiting for everything to be finalized. It was agonizing.\n\nI felt like I was just a cog in a machine, and that my feelings didn't really matter. Like I was just a vessel, and the baby was the important part.\n\nBut Bren helped me to remember that I *did* have a voice. She encouraged me to ask questions, to express my concerns, and to advocate for what I wanted.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa were amazing. They were so respectful of my feelings, and they made me feel like I was a part of the process. They wanted to get to know me, and they wanted to understand my story.\n\nSo, yeah. It was a rollercoaster. There were times when I felt completely in control, and times when I felt completely powerless. But ultimately, I think I was able to navigate the process in a way that felt right for me.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but it was the best I could do. And I'm grateful for the support I received along the way. It helped me to feel like I was making the right decision, and that I was doing everything I could to give the baby the best possible life. It was *my* decision, even if it didn't always feel like it. And that's what mattered most.", "(Long pause. She looks down at her hands, then up, meeting your gaze directly. Her voice is softer than usual.)\n\nThat's\u2026 a really hard question. And I've thought about it a lot. Like, *a lot* a lot.\n\nThere are days when I wonder\u2026 what if? What if I had kept the baby? What if I had figured out a way to make it work? What if things had been different?\n\nBut then I remember where I was in my life. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out who I was. I was barely able to take care of myself, let alone a baby.\n\nAnd I remember Mark and Vanessa. And how excited they were to become parents. And how much love they had to give.\n\nAnd I realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't about giving up on the baby. It was about giving the baby the best possible life. A life that I couldn't provide.\n\nSo\u2026 yeah. I think I would make the same decision. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, and it still hurts sometimes. But it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't think about the baby. I do. All the time. And I hope he or she is happy and healthy and loved.\n\nBut I also know that I'm on the right path. I'm finishing school, I'm pursuing my dreams, and I'm becoming a stronger, more resilient person.\n\nAnd I think that's what the baby would want for me.\n\nSo yeah. I would make the same decision. It wasn't easy, but it was right. And I'm learning to live with that. And to find peace with it.\n\n(She looks away, a small, sad smile playing on her lips.)\n\nIt's still\u2026 a lot. But I'm okay. I think. I hope.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment) Okay. That's\u2026 a hard one. It wasn't like flipping a switch, you know? It wasn't like, \"Okay, baby's gone, now I'm fine.\" It was\u2026 messy. Really messy.\n\nFor a while, I just felt\u2026 empty. Like a part of me was missing. I cried a lot. I didn't want to see anyone. I just wanted to curl up in my room and disappear.\n\nBren was amazing, though. She just let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix me, or tell me to cheer up. She just sat with me and listened. And she made me tea. A lot of tea.\n\nI also started writing a lot. Poetry, mostly. It was a way to process my emotions, to make sense of everything that had happened. It wasn't pretty, but it helped.\n\nI talked to a therapist, too. Which was\u2026 awkward at first. But she was really good. She helped me to understand my feelings and to develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nAnd I leaned on my friends. Leah, when we were talking again. And some of the other kids at school. It helped to know that I wasn't alone.\n\nIt took a long time. Months, really. There were good days and bad days. Days when I felt like I was finally moving on, and days when I felt like I was back at square one.\n\nBut eventually, I started to heal. I started to accept that I had made the right decision, even though it was the hardest decision I've ever made. I started to focus on my own future, and on my own dreams.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes. I still think about the baby. But the pain is less sharp now. It's more like a dull ache. And I know that the baby is loved and cared for, and that's what matters most.\n\nIt's not something you ever really \"get over,\" I think. It's something you learn to live with. It's a part of my story. And it's made me a stronger, more compassionate person.\n\nSo yeah. It was hard. Really hard. But I got through it. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me along the way. And I'm grateful for the lessons I learned. Even the painful ones.", "Okay, yeah. That's\u2026 a good question. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, definitely. People think adoption is just this perfect, happy ending, but it's way more complicated than that.\n\nMark and Vanessa were amazing, truly. But it wasn't always easy. There were definitely some\u2026 awkward moments.\n\nAt first, they were really eager to be involved in everything. They wanted to come to all my doctor's appointments, they wanted to pick out the baby's name, they wanted to decorate the nursery. Which, I get. They were excited. But it felt\u2026 overwhelming. Like they were trying to take over.\n\nI needed space. I needed to feel like I was still in control of my own body and my own decisions. So I had to have a really honest conversation with them. I told them that I appreciated their enthusiasm, but that I needed them to respect my boundaries.\n\nAnd they did. They listened. They backed off. And that made a huge difference.\n\nThere was also the issue of\u2026 expectations. They had a certain idea of what they wanted in an adoptive mother. They wanted someone who was young and healthy and stable. And I\u2026 well, I was none of those things.\n\nI was a pregnant teenager. I was scared and confused and uncertain about the future. And I worried that they would judge me, or that they would change their minds.\n\nBut they didn't. They saw past my flaws and my mistakes. They saw my heart. And they accepted me for who I was.\n\nWe had a lot of long talks. About my feelings, about their expectations, about what we all wanted for the baby. It wasn't always easy, but it was always honest.\n\nAnd in the end, we came to a place of understanding and respect. We agreed that the most important thing was the well-being of the baby. And we all worked together to make that happen.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. But it was real. And it was worth it. Because even though it was hard, I knew that I was making the right decision. And I knew that the baby would be loved and cared for. And that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a complicated one. And honestly, it still stings a little bit to think about.\n\nPaulie\u2026 he wasn't exactly equipped to be a father. He was sweet, don't get me wrong. But he was also\u2026 immature. And kinda clueless. He was more concerned with his band and his music than with, you know, actually being responsible.\n\nHe wanted to be involved, at first. He said he wanted to help raise the baby. But he didn't really understand what that meant. He didn't want to give up his lifestyle, and he didn't want to make any sacrifices.\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't think it would be fair to the baby. To have a father who wasn't really present, who wasn't really invested. I wanted the baby to have parents who were committed and stable and loving.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. I felt bad about it. I knew it would hurt Paulie. But I had to do what was best for the baby. And I didn't think that included him.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were so excited to be parents. They were so prepared and so eager to provide a loving home for the baby. They were the perfect choice.\n\nPaulie\u2026 he wasn't happy about it, obviously. He tried to fight it, at first. But eventually, he realized that it was for the best. He said he understood. But I could tell he was still hurt.\n\nIt was a difficult conversation. And it left me feeling really conflicted. But I knew I had made the right decision. Even if it wasn't the easiest one.\n\nIt's not about punishing Paulie. It's about protecting the baby. And giving him or her the best possible start in life. And that's what matters most.\n\nIt still makes me sad, though. It's not ideal. But life isn't always ideal. And sometimes, you have to make tough choices. And you have to live with the consequences.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a hard one to talk about. It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and suddenly knew what to do. It was a process. A really long, messy, emotional process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to tell my parents. I didn't know how I was going to finish school. I didn't know how I was going to raise a baby. I was sixteen! I was still figuring out *myself*.\n\nI considered all the options. Abortion, keeping the baby, adoption. And I talked to a lot of people about it. My dad, Bren, a counselor at school.\n\nAbortion\u2026 it just didn't feel right. I know people have different opinions, and that's okay. But for me, it felt like\u2026 ending a life. And I couldn't do that.\n\nKeeping the baby\u2026 that felt even more impossible. I knew I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved. I wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable. I wasn't emotionally prepared. It wouldn't be fair to the baby, and it wouldn't be fair to me.\n\nAnd then Bren suggested adoption. And at first, I was really resistant. It felt like\u2026 giving up. Like admitting defeat.\n\nBut then I started to think about it. And I realized that it wasn't about giving up. It was about making a selfless decision. It was about giving the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them.\n\nIt was about choosing what was best for the baby, even if it meant sacrificing my own desires.\n\nAnd the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. It wasn't the easy option, but it was the right option.\n\nIt was a really hard decision to make. And I still have moments of doubt and sadness. But I know that I made the best choice I could. And I hope that the baby will have a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nIt wasn't an idea I *came up with*. It was a realization. A slow, painful realization that I wasn't ready to be a mom. And that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 that's the hardest question. And honestly, I'm still coping. It's not something you just \"get over.\" It's\u2026 a part of me now.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026 a mess. A lot of crying. A lot of anger. A lot of guilt. I felt like I was losing a piece of myself. Like I was failing as a woman, as a person.\n\nBren was amazing. She just\u2026 let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix things or tell me it would be okay. She just sat with me and listened. And she held me when I needed to be held.\n\nI also started writing a lot. Poetry, mostly. It was a way to process my emotions, to make sense of everything that was happening. It was a way to say goodbye.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It was hard at first, because I'm not really one to open up. But she helped me to understand my feelings and to develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nI also focused on the positive. I reminded myself that I was doing this for the baby. That I was giving him or her a chance at a good life. That I was making the best decision I could, given the circumstances.\n\nBut it still hurt. It still does. There are days when I just\u2026 break down. When I miss the baby, even though I never even got to hold him or her.\n\nI also keep in touch with Mark and Vanessa. They send me pictures and updates, and it's\u2026 bittersweet. It's wonderful to see the baby thriving, but it also reminds me of what I've given up.\n\nIt's a complicated process. It's not easy. But I'm learning to live with it. I'm learning to accept my feelings, and to forgive myself.\n\nAnd I'm learning that love doesn't always mean holding on. Sometimes, it means letting go. And that's the hardest lesson of all.\n\nIt's still\u2026 raw. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. And I know that someday, I'll be able to look back on this experience with gratitude, instead of just pain. But right now? It still stings. A lot.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. It's not like it was a simple, straightforward thing. It took time, and a lot of awkward conversations.\n\nWhen I first met Mark and Vanessa, I was\u2026 nervous. Really nervous. It felt weird, handing over my baby to strangers. Even though they weren't strangers for long.\n\nThey were\u2026 nice. Too nice, almost. They were so eager and excited, and I felt like I was letting them down by giving them a baby I couldn't keep.\n\nBut they were also really understanding. They didn't try to pressure me or make me feel guilty. They just listened, and they asked questions, and they tried to get to know me.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings with the social worker, and we talked about everything. About my hopes and dreams for the baby, about their plans for the future, about how we would stay in touch.\n\nIt was hard, talking about giving up the baby. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But Mark and Vanessa were so supportive. They reassured me that I was making the right decision, and they promised to love and care for the baby as if he or she were their own.\n\nOver time, I started to feel more comfortable around them. I realized that they weren't just strangers. They were people who genuinely wanted to be parents. People who were willing to open their hearts and their home to a child in need.\n\nWe developed a really good relationship. We still keep in touch. They send me pictures and updates, and I send them letters. They even invited me to the baby's first birthday party.\n\nIt's not the same as being the baby's mom, of course. But it's\u2026 good. It's comforting to know that the baby is happy and healthy and loved.\n\nIt was a complicated process, and it was emotionally draining. But I'm grateful for Mark and Vanessa. They made a difficult situation a little bit easier. And they gave my baby a chance at a good life. And that's all I ever wanted.", "(Sighs) Okay, yeah. That's\u2026 a loaded question. But a fair one.\n\nHas it changed me? Oh, absolutely. It's kinda hard to imagine who I'd be *without* it, honestly. It's like\u2026 before this, I was just drifting. I was sarcastic and cynical and I didn't really have any direction. I was just trying to get through high school without being noticed.\n\nBut this\u2026 this forced me to grow up. It forced me to confront some really difficult realities. It forced me to make some really tough decisions.\n\nI'm definitely more mature now. I'm more responsible. I'm more aware of the world around me. I'm more empathetic.\n\nI've also learned a lot about myself. I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I've learned that I'm capable of making difficult choices, even when they're painful. I've learned that I'm not afraid to ask for help.\n\nIt's also made me more independent. I've had to rely on myself a lot, and I've learned to trust my own instincts.\n\nIt's not all good, though. It's also made me more cautious. More guarded. More afraid of getting hurt.\n\nAnd it's definitely changed my perspective on the future. I don't have the same expectations anymore. I'm not sure what my life is going to look like, and that's okay.\n\nIt's been a really challenging experience, but it's also been a really transformative one. It's made me who I am today. And I think, in the long run, that's a good thing.\n\nIt's not the path I would have chosen, but it's the path I'm on. And I'm trying to make the best of it. And I'm learning to embrace the person I'm becoming. Even if she's a little bit messy and complicated.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started. That was\u2026 the worst. Seriously. Maplewood is a small town, and gossip travels faster than the speed of light. It felt like everyone had an opinion on my situation, and they weren't afraid to share it.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I just pretended it wasn't happening. But that didn't work. It was impossible to escape. People were whispering behind my back in the hallways at school. My friends' parents were giving me weird looks. Even the cashier at the grocery store was staring at me.\n\nThen I tried to get angry. I wanted to confront everyone who was talking about me, to tell them to mind their own business. But Bren talked me out of it. She said that would just fuel the fire.\n\nSo, I ended up doing a combination of things. I surrounded myself with people who supported me \u2013 Bren, my dad, Leah (when we were still talking). I spent a lot of time at home, listening to music and reading books. I tried to focus on the things that made me happy.\n\nAnd I learned to develop a really thick skin. I learned to tune out the noise and to not let other people's opinions affect me. It wasn't easy, but I got better at it.\n\nI also found a weird sort of\u2026 amusement in it. Like, some of the rumors were so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh. People were saying all sorts of things about who the father was, and about what I was planning to do with the baby. It was absurd.\n\nBut honestly, the hardest part was the judgment. The feeling that everyone was looking down on me, that I had somehow failed. It took a lot of self-reflection and a lot of support from Bren to realize that I hadn't failed. I had just made a difficult decision, and I was doing the best I could.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, to think about all the gossip and the rumors. But I've learned to let it go. I've learned that other people's opinions don't define me. And I've learned that the only thing that really matters is what I think of myself. And I'm okay with who I am. Even if some people in Maplewood aren't.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't a quick decision, that's for sure. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and thought, \"Oh, yeah, adoption sounds great!\" It was a lot of agonizing, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nThe biggest thing was\u2026 I just wasn't ready. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still in high school. I have dreams and goals that I want to pursue. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved while I was still trying to figure out my own life.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to the baby. It wouldn't be fair to me.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby needs \u2013 a stable home, financial security, emotional support. And I just didn't feel like I could provide those things, not right now.\n\nI also thought about my mom. She wasn't exactly the most reliable parent. And I didn't want to repeat that pattern. I wanted to give my baby a better chance at a happy and healthy life.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were just\u2026 amazing. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They were so kind and compassionate. And they made me feel like my baby would be loved and cherished.\n\nIt was still a really hard decision. It felt like giving up a part of myself. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It was the most selfless thing I could do.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting a baby. It was about wanting what was best for the baby. And I truly believe that giving her to Mark and Vanessa was the best thing I could do for her.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I find comfort in knowing that she's going to have a good life. And that I made a difficult decision, not for myself, but for her.\n\nIt's not a story with a happy ending, exactly. But it's a story about love and sacrifice and doing what's right, even when it's hard. And I think that's something to be proud of. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 hard to talk about. It's not like I haven't thought about it a million times already.\n\nMy biggest fear wasn't about the logistics of the adoption, or the legal stuff, or even about whether Mark and Vanessa would be good parents. I knew they would be. They seemed genuinely excited and loving.\n\nMy biggest fear was\u2026 that I would regret it.\n\nThat after the baby was born, and after I handed him or her over, I would be consumed by guilt and sadness and regret. That I would spend the rest of my life wondering \"what if?\"\n\nThat I would feel like I had given away a piece of myself.\n\nIt's a selfish fear, I know. I was trying to do what was best for the baby, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I was making a mistake.\n\nI was scared that I wouldn't be able to move on. That I would be haunted by the memory of the baby I gave up.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. She told me that it was okay to feel sad, and that it was okay to grieve. She said that regret is a natural part of the process.\n\nBut it didn't make it any easier.\n\nI think what helped me the most was getting to know Mark and Vanessa. Seeing how much they wanted a baby, and how much they were willing to give. It made me feel like I was making the right decision.\n\nBut even now, I still have moments of doubt. Moments where I wonder if I did the right thing.\n\nIt's a fear that I'll probably carry with me for a long time. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to trust that I made the best decision I could, given the circumstances.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's a really big decision. And it's scary. And it's okay to be scared. Even if you don't want to admit it.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Everyone always asks about Bleeker. It's\u2026 a long story. And a slightly embarrassing one.\n\nOkay, so Paul, you know, the guy\u2026 he wasn't exactly the most imaginative person. He kept asking me what I wanted to name the baby, and I was like, \"I don't know! I haven't even thought about it!\"\n\nAnd he was just\u2026 staring at a street sign. A street sign for Bleeker Street. And he said, \"What about Bleeker?\"\n\nI was like, \"Bleeker? Seriously? That's the best you can do?\"\n\nHe said it sounded \"cool\" and \"artsy.\" Which, let's be real, it doesn't. It sounds like a street.\n\nBut I was tired of arguing with him, and honestly, I kind of liked the irony of it. Like, naming the baby after a street. It was just\u2026 weird. And I'm into weird.\n\nSo I said, \"Fine. Bleeker it is.\"\n\nAnd he was so proud of himself. It was kind of pathetic, actually.\n\nI didn't think it would stick. I thought we'd come up with a better name later. But then he started referring to himself as \"Bleeker\" and it just\u2026 became a thing.\n\nIt's a terrible name, honestly. But it's also kind of endearing. It reminds me of that awkward, confusing time in my life. And it's a good story to tell.\n\nSo yeah. That's how the baby got the name Bleeker. Thanks, Paul. You're a genius. (Said with maximum sarcasm).", "Oh, man. Punk. Okay, buckle up, because I could talk about this for hours.\n\nIt wasn't just the music, though the music was a *huge* part of it. It was raw, and angry, and honest. It didn't try to be pretty or polished. It just *was*. And that resonated with me. Especially at a time when everything else felt fake and superficial.\n\nGrowing up in Maplewood, everything felt so\u2026 cookie-cutter. Everyone was trying to fit in, to be normal. And I just\u2026 didn't. I never felt like I belonged.\n\nPunk was the first place where I felt like I could be myself. It was a community of outsiders, of misfits, of people who didn't give a damn what anyone else thought.\n\nIt was about questioning authority, about challenging the status quo, about rejecting everything that was mainstream. And that appealed to me. I've always been a bit of a rebel.\n\nThe fashion was a big part of it too. The ripped jeans, the leather jackets, the safety pins\u2026 it was a way of saying \"I don't care what you think.\" It was a way of expressing your individuality.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the music and the fashion. It was about a whole attitude. A DIY ethic. A sense of community. A belief in the power of art to change the world.\n\nI started listening to bands like The Clash, The Ramones, and Bikini Kill. And I started reading about the punk movement. And I realized that it wasn't just about music. It was about a way of life.\n\nIt gave me a voice. It gave me a sense of belonging. It gave me the courage to be myself.\n\nSo yeah. That's what drew me to punk. It was a lifeline. It was a rebellion. It was a way of finding my place in the world. And it still is. It's more than just music to me. It's a part of who I am. And I don't think that will ever change.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I really like to think about, honestly. But okay, I'll try to answer it.\n\nIt messed me up, a lot. My mom leaving when I was little\u2026 it made me really wary of getting close to people. Like, what's the point of investing in a relationship if the other person is just going to walk away?\n\nI think that's why I've always been a bit of a loner. I have friends, but I don't let people get *too* close. I keep them at arm's length. It's a defense mechanism, I guess.\n\nIt also made me really independent. I learned early on that I could only rely on myself. If I wanted something done, I had to do it myself. I couldn't count on anyone else.\n\nAnd it definitely affected my relationship with my dad. We were close, but after my mom left, he kind of shut down emotionally. He wasn't really able to express his feelings, and I wasn't really able to express mine. It created this\u2026 distance between us.\n\nIt made me scared of commitment, too. Like, what if I get into a relationship and then the other person decides they don't want to be with me anymore? What if I end up getting hurt?\n\nIt's taken me a long time to start to trust people again. And even now, I still struggle with it. I still have moments where I just want to push everyone away.\n\nBut I'm learning. I'm learning that not everyone is going to abandon me. I'm learning that it's okay to be vulnerable. And I'm learning that love is worth the risk.\n\nIt's not easy, though. It's a constant process of healing and growth. And I'm still a work in progress. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.\n\nIt's just\u2026 my mom leaving left a hole in my life. And it's taken me a long time to realize that I can't fill that hole with anyone else. I have to fill it myself. And that's okay. It's more than okay. It's necessary.", "Ugh, \"special\" and \"unique\" feel like\u2026 a lot of pressure. It's not like I *tried* to have a special or unique story. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nBut I guess, if I had to put my finger on it, it's the messiness of it all. Most stories you hear are neat and tidy. Everything wraps up nicely with a bow on top. Mine\u2026 isn't like that.\n\nIt's about a teenager who gets pregnant, and decides to give the baby up for adoption. It's not a glamorous story. It's not a heartwarming story. It's a complicated story.\n\nAnd it's honest. I don't try to sugarcoat things. I don't pretend that everything is okay when it's not. I just tell it like it is.\n\nI think a lot of people can relate to that. To feeling lost and confused and overwhelmed. To having to make difficult decisions. To trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life.\n\nAnd I think it's also unique because it's not about finding a perfect solution. It's about finding the best solution, given the circumstances. It's about accepting that life is messy and unpredictable, and that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just let go.\n\nI'm not a hero. I'm not a role model. I'm just a girl who made a difficult decision, and who's trying to navigate the consequences.\n\nBut maybe, by sharing my story, I can help other people feel less alone. Maybe I can help them to see that it's okay to be imperfect. And maybe I can help them to find their own strength and resilience.\n\nSo yeah. I guess that's what makes my story special. It's messy, it's honest, and it's real. And it's a story that I'm still writing. One day at a time.", "Okay, this is important. Friends are\u2026 well, they're everything. Especially when life is being a total jerk. I've learned that the hard way.\n\nSo, what do I look for in a good friend? It's not about being popular or having a lot of money or anything like that. It's about\u2026 being real.\n\nFirst, I value **honesty**. I want someone who will tell me the truth, even when it's hard to hear. Someone who won't sugarcoat things or try to spare my feelings. I can handle the truth, even if it stings.\n\nSecond, I value **loyalty**. I want someone who will have my back, no matter what. Someone who will stand up for me when I'm being attacked. Someone who won't talk behind my back.\n\nThird, I value **a good sense of humor**. Life is too short to be serious all the time. I want someone who can make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down. Someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously.\n\nFourth, I value **acceptance**. I want someone who will accept me for who I am, flaws and all. Someone who won't try to change me. Someone who will love me unconditionally.\n\nAnd fifth, I value **shared interests**. It's not essential, but it's nice to have someone who shares my passions. Someone who I can talk to about music, or movies, or vintage clothes.\n\nBasically, I want someone who is genuine, trustworthy, and fun to be around. Someone who I can be myself with, without having to pretend to be someone I'm not.\n\nIt's hard to find people like that. But when you do, you hold on tight. Because good friends are rare and precious. And they're worth their weight in gold. Or, you know, vintage records. Whatever.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 complicated. It's not like it's been a smooth ride, you know? It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026 awkward at first. He was worried, obviously. And a little bit disappointed, I think. But he came around. He's been really supportive, in his own quiet way. He doesn't always know what to say, but he's always there for me.\n\nBren has been amazing, like I've said before. She's been my rock. She's the one I talk to about everything. She doesn't judge me, she just listens. And she helps me to see things from different perspectives.\n\nBut with Leah\u2026 that's been the hardest part. We used to be inseparable. We told each other everything. But after I told her I was pregnant, things just\u2026 changed. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she didn't know how to relate to me anymore. It felt like she was ashamed of me.\n\nIt really hurt. I miss her a lot. We haven't really talked since. It's like there's this huge wall between us.\n\nSome of my other friends have been distant too. They don't know what to say, or how to act around me. It's like I've become some kind of\u2026 leper.\n\nAnd then there are the people who are just\u2026 judgmental. Who whisper behind my back, or give me pitying looks. Those people I just try to avoid.\n\nIt's been a really isolating experience. It's made me realize who my true friends are. And it's made me appreciate the people who have stuck by me, even when things have been tough.\n\nIt's also made me realize that relationships are fragile. They can change in an instant. And that you have to cherish the people you love, because you never know when they might be gone.\n\nSo yeah. It's been a rollercoaster. Some relationships have gotten stronger, some have gotten weaker, and some have just\u2026 disappeared. It's been a painful lesson, but it's one I needed to learn. And I'm trying to move forward, and to focus on the people who truly care about me. Even if there are fewer of them now.", "Okay, this is getting\u2026 philosophical. I'm not really one for grand pronouncements about the meaning of life, but alright, I'll try.\n\nI think a lot of my worldview is shaped by the fact that I've seen a lot of\u2026 messiness. Life isn't always neat and tidy. People aren't always what they seem. And things don't always go according to plan.\n\nSo, I'm a pretty big believer in **authenticity**. I think it's important to be true to yourself, even if it means being different. Even if it means going against the grain. I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not, just to fit in.\n\nI also believe in **compassion**. I think it's important to be kind and understanding to others, even when they're being difficult. Everyone is fighting their own battles, and you never know what someone else is going through.\n\nI'm a firm believer in **individual responsibility**. I think we all have a responsibility to make our own choices and to live with the consequences. You can't blame other people for your mistakes.\n\nAnd I think it's important to **question everything**. Don't just accept things at face value. Ask why. Challenge assumptions. Think for yourself.\n\nI also believe in the power of **art**. Music, movies, books\u2026 they can all help us to understand ourselves and the world around us. They can inspire us, challenge us, and connect us to something bigger than ourselves.\n\nI'm not a religious person, but I do believe in something\u2026 bigger. Something that connects us all. I don't know what it is, but I feel it.\n\nAnd I think it's important to **find joy in the small things**. A good cup of coffee, a beautiful sunset, a funny conversation with a friend. Those are the things that make life worth living.\n\nSo yeah. Authenticity, compassion, responsibility, questioning, art, connection, and joy. Those are some of the values and beliefs that shape my worldview. It's not a perfect system, but it's mine. And it's helping me to navigate this crazy, messy, beautiful life.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. But I\u2019ll tell you. It took *forever* to decide. It wasn\u2019t like, a lightning bolt moment. It was a lot of arguing with Bren and Mark and Vanessa, and a lot of flipping through baby name books.\n\nI wanted something\u2026 not too common. Something a little bit different. But not *too* different, you know? I didn\u2019t want the baby to be teased or anything.\n\nWe went back and forth for weeks. We considered everything. Old family names, names from books, names from songs\u2026 nothing felt right.\n\nThen, Vanessa suggested **Phoenix**.\n\nAnd at first, I was like, \u201cSeriously? Phoenix? That\u2019s\u2026 intense.\u201d It sounds like a superhero or something.\n\nBut then she explained why she liked it. She said a phoenix is a bird that rises from the ashes. It symbolizes rebirth and renewal and hope. And she said that felt appropriate, given the circumstances.\n\nAnd\u2026 she was right.\n\nThis whole situation has been really difficult. It\u2019s been painful and scary and overwhelming. But it\u2019s also been a chance for me to grow and to learn. It\u2019s been a chance to make a difficult decision and to do what\u2019s best for everyone involved.\n\nAnd I think Phoenix represents that. It represents the idea that even after something terrible happens, you can still rise above it. You can still find hope. You can still create something beautiful.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s just a cool name. It sounds strong and independent. And I want my baby to be strong and independent.\n\nSo, yeah. Phoenix. It\u2019s not a traditional name, but it feels right. It feels like a symbol of hope and resilience. And it feels like a good name for a little person who\u2019s going to have a bright future.\n\nIt was a hard decision, but I think we made the right one. And I can\u2019t wait to meet my little Phoenix. Even if I won\u2019t be the one raising him or her. It still feels\u2026 special.", "Wow. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It feels like a lifetime ago, and also like yesterday, all at the same time.\n\nI learned a *lot*. About myself, and about the world. It wasn't exactly the kind of education you get in school, that's for sure.\n\nI learned that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always considered myself pretty independent, but this\u2026 this was a whole different level. I had to make some really difficult decisions, and I had to stand up for what I believed in, even when it was unpopular.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to think I had to do everything on my own, but I realized that I couldn't. I needed Bren, and my dad, and even some of my friends. And I needed to be willing to accept their support.\n\nI learned that people are complicated. There's good and bad in everyone, and you can't always judge a book by its cover. Mark and Vanessa, for example, were so kind and understanding, and they completely changed my perspective on things.\n\nI learned that life isn't fair. Sometimes bad things happen to good people, and there's nothing you can do about it. But you can choose how you react to those things. You can choose to be bitter and angry, or you can choose to be resilient and hopeful.\n\nI learned that love comes in many forms. It's not just about romantic love, or family love. It's about compassion, and empathy, and connection. And it's about being willing to put someone else's needs before your own.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused and scared and uncertain. It's okay to just\u2026 be.\n\nIt was a really hard experience, but it also made me a better person. It taught me a lot about myself, and about the world. And I'm grateful for that. Even if I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\n\nIt showed me that even in the messiest, most complicated situations, there's always hope. And that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the ones that lead to the greatest growth. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "(Sighs) That's\u2026 a loaded question. It's easy to say \"yes,\" to think about all the things I could have done differently. But honestly? I'm not sure.\n\nIf I could go back in time, would I have been more careful? Maybe. But I was young, and stupid, and I made a mistake. It happens.\n\nWould I have told someone sooner? Probably. Keeping it a secret for so long was\u2026 stressful. But I was scared. Scared of what people would think, scared of disappointing my dad, scared of everything.\n\nBut then I think about all the good things that came out of it. I met Bren, who has been the most amazing support system. I learned a lot about myself. I grew up. I made a difficult decision, and I stood by it.\n\nAnd I met Mark and Vanessa, who are going to give my baby a wonderful life.\n\nSo, would I change anything? I don't know. Maybe. But if I did, I might not be the person I am today. And I think, despite everything, I'm okay with who I am.\n\nI wish things had been easier, of course. I wish I hadn't had to go through so much pain and uncertainty. But I think those experiences made me stronger. They made me more resilient. They made me more compassionate.\n\nSo, no. I don't think I would change anything. Not really. Because even the bad things have taught me something. And I'm grateful for that.\n\nIt's been a messy, complicated, and sometimes heartbreaking experience. But it's also been a journey of growth and self-discovery. And I wouldn't trade that for anything.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. And I'm still figuring things out. But I'm getting there. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Disappointment. My constant companion. Seriously, if disappointment was a person, we'd be best friends. Or enemies. It's complicated.\n\nOkay, so how do I deal with it? It's not pretty. Usually, it involves a lot of wallowing and self-pity. And maybe a pint of ice cream. Or two.\n\nBut after the initial meltdown, I try to remind myself that things rarely go according to plan. Life is messy and unpredictable, and you have to be able to roll with the punches.\n\nI also try to focus on what I *can* control. I can't control what other people do, or what happens to me. But I can control my own reactions. I can choose to be positive, or I can choose to be negative. I can choose to give up, or I can choose to keep trying.\n\nAnd I talk to Bren. She's really good at putting things into perspective. She reminds me that even when things don't go as planned, there's always something to be learned.\n\nI also try to find the silver lining. Even in the worst situations, there's usually something good to be found. It might be a small thing, but it's there.\n\nAnd I remind myself that it's okay to be sad. It's okay to grieve. It's okay to feel disappointed. You're human. You're allowed to have feelings.\n\nBut you can't let disappointment consume you. You have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and keep moving forward.\n\nIt's not easy. It takes practice. But it's worth it. Because life is too short to spend it being miserable.\n\nSo yeah. Wallowing, ice cream, talking to Bren, finding the silver lining, and reminding myself that it's okay to be sad. That's my strategy. It's not perfect, but it works. Most of the time. And sometimes, you just need a really good cry. That helps too.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on Leah. It still\u2026 stings, you know?\n\nAt the beginning, Leah was my *everything*. My best friend, my partner in crime, the one person who always understood me. We were inseparable. We spent all our time together, talking about everything and nothing. We were just\u2026 us.\n\nBut then I got pregnant, and everything changed. It wasn't that Leah was intentionally mean or anything. It was just\u2026 awkward. She didn't know how to react. She didn't know what to say.\n\nAnd I think she was scared. Scared of what my pregnancy meant for our friendship. Scared of what people would think of us. Scared of the future.\n\nSo she started to pull away. She stopped calling as much. She stopped hanging out as much. She started to distance herself from me.\n\nAnd I understood, I guess. I didn't like it, but I understood. I knew I was changing, and I knew that our friendship couldn't stay the same.\n\nBut it still hurt. It felt like she was abandoning me when I needed her the most.\n\nThe turning point was when she came over to see me after I'd decided to give the baby up for adoption. She was quiet at first, and then she just\u2026 started talking. She apologized for being distant, and she told me how proud she was of me.\n\nAnd we just\u2026 talked. For hours. We talked about everything. About our friendship, about my pregnancy, about the future.\n\nIt wasn't the same as it used to be. Our friendship had changed. But it was still there. It was still real.\n\nWe learned that even though we were growing up and changing, we could still be friends. We just had to be willing to accept each other for who we were, and to support each other through the tough times.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect ending, but it was a good one. And I'm grateful for Leah. She's still my friend, even if we don't see each other as much as we used to. And I know that she'll always be there for me, no matter what.\n\nIt just\u2026 took a while to get there. And it was a really painful process. But it was worth it. Because losing Leah would have been the worst thing of all.", "(Long pause. A sigh.)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026 a surprisingly hard question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Morning sickness, weird cravings, people staring at you\u2026 it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nBut\u2026 if I had to pick a favorite part\u2026 it was feeling the baby kick.\n\nSeriously. It sounds cheesy, I know. But it was\u2026 amazing.\n\nAt first, it was just little flutters, like butterflies in my stomach. And then, as the months went on, the kicks got stronger and more frequent. It was like the baby was saying, \"Hey, I'm here! I'm real!\"\n\nIt was a really powerful feeling. It made me feel connected to the baby, even though I knew I was giving him or her up for adoption. It reminded me that this was a real person, with a life of their own.\n\nAnd it was kind of\u2026 magical. Like, I was carrying a little secret inside me. A little miracle.\n\nI remember one time, I was lying in bed, listening to music, and the baby kicked really hard. It startled me, and I started laughing. And then I realized that the baby was laughing too. Or at least, that's what it felt like.\n\nIt was a really special moment. And it's something I'll never forget.\n\nIt didn't make the decision to give the baby up any easier, but it did make me feel a little bit better about it. It reminded me that I was doing this for the right reasons.\n\nSo yeah. The kicks. That was my favorite part. It was a little bit of magic in a really complicated situation. And it's something I'll always cherish. Even if it makes me a little bit sad sometimes."]
