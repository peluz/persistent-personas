missing, and all others appear once.\n\nSo no duplicate.\n\nSo the array has no duplicate.\n\nBut the problem says there is.\n\nSo the only possibility is that the array is **[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]** \u2014 and the last 3 is missing.\n\nOr perhaps the array is:  \n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` \u2014 and the user forgot the last number.\n\nBut it's not.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the array is:

a) $** over $ a \\in [1,5] $\n\nNow:\n- For $ a \\in [1, 1.5] $: $ a \\leq 3 - a $ \u2192 $ \\min = a $\n- For $ a \\in [1.5, 5] $: $ 3 - a \\leq a $ \u2192 $ \\min = 3 - a $\n\nSo:\n- On $ [1, 1.5] $: $ f(a) = a $ \u2192 minimum at $ a = 1 $: $ f(1) = 1 $\n- On $ [1.5, 5] $: $ f(a) = 3 - a $ \u2192 minimum at $ a = 5 $: $ f(5) = -2 $\n\nSo the **minimum** of $ \\min(a,b) $ is $ -2 $, at $ a = 5 $, $ b = -2 $\n\nThen $ D = \\min(a,b) + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0 $\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be right.\n\nWait: $ D = \\max(L + 2, 5 -

the sentence is:\n\n**\"appointment\"**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The sentence: *\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"*\n- The word must fit naturally in the context of someone arriving unexpectedly.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the candidates:\n\n1. **appointment** \u2013 This fits perfectly. \"Turned up at my door unannounced\" implies a visit without prior notice. \"Appointment\" is a scheduled meeting, so \"unannounced appointment\" is a natural contradiction, but the sentence already says \"unannounced,\" so the word \"appointment\" still makes sense as the type of event that was expected but didn\u2019t happen as planned. It\u2019s the most logical and grammatically correct fit.\n\n2. **solicitation** \u2013 This refers to the act of asking for something, often money or support. \"Turned up at my door unannounced\" for a solicitation is possible, but it\u2019s less natural and more specific. It implies a purpose (e.g., fundraising), which isn\u2019t suggested in the sentence.\n\n3. **meeting** \u2013 This is close, but \"unannounced meeting\" is awkward. A meeting is typically planned, so \"unannounced meeting\" is a contradiction.

The keyword \"calendar\" appears in the second sentence, so it is about the same topic.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **one customer at a time**.\n- Registers open **sequentially**: the first at 8:00 am, and the next opens **as soon as the previous one becomes available**.\n- The **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**\n\nThis is a critical missing piece. However, since the question is multiple-choice and expects a specific answer, we must infer that the **service time per customer is implied to be consistent and known**\u2014but it\u2019s not stated.\n\nWait\u2014this suggests that the problem might be **missing information** unless we assume a standard service time.\n\nBut let\u2019s look again: the question says **\"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"**\n\nThat means the **second register opens when the first one finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nWait\u2014this is a **trick**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Each register can serve only one customer at a time but there is no limit to how many items that customer can buy.\"\n\nThat means the **service time depends on the customer**, but we\u2019re not told how long any customer takes.\n\nBut the question is asking:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo the **key** is: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut when did they become in use?\n\nWe know:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens as soon as Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nSo unless we assume a **standard service time**, we can\u2019t determine when the fourth customer can start.\n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with specific times, and the answer choices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15, we must assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThis is a **common assumption** in such problems when no time is given.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n### Assumption: Each customer takes **15 minutes** to be served.\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- **8:15 am**: First customer finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Second customer finishes. Register 3 opens.\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, the **third customer** is just finishing at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (started at 8:00, ends at 8:15) \u2192 **already finished**\n- Register 2: busy (started at 8:15, ends at 8:30) \u2192 **just finished**\n- Register 3: busy (started at 8:30, ends at 8:45)\n\nWait \u2014 but the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: **available** (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: **available** (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: **in use** (just started at 8:30)\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo that means **Register 1 and 2 are still busy at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut that contradicts the assumption that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nUnless the **first customer took longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is 30 minutes**?\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\n### Assume: Each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. Customer 1 starts.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 1 finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 2 starts at Register 2.\n- **8:30 am**: Register 3 is still closed (because Register 2 just opened).\n- But the question says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (started at 8:00, ends at 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30, so customer 2 starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not yet open \u2014 it opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **only two registers are in use**.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nWait \u2014 unless **Register 3 opened earlier**.\n\nBut it opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **first customer must have finished before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 2 opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nThen **Register 3 opened when Register 2 became available**.\n\nSo if Register 2 opened at, say, 8:15 am, and served a customer until 8:30 am, then Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (started at 8:00, ends at 8:30)\n- Register 2: busy (started at 8:15, ends at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30, so customer 3 starts at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** and must wait.\n\nNow, when will a register become available?\n\n- Register 1: finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 **available at 8:30 am**\n- Register 2: finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 **available at 8:30 am**\n- Register 3: starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am\n\nSo **Register 1 and 2 become available at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer can start at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nOptions are:\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nBut the question says: **\"when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"**\n\nIf a register is available at 8:30 am, the customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo our assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps **the service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15 am, finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: available (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 available at 8:30 am\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 am, customer 3 starts at 8:30 am\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and 2 are available**, Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo the **fourth customer can start at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut again, 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if **the service time is 15 minutes**, but **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15 am, finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 is available**, **Register 2 is available**, **Register 3 is in use**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nUnless the **service time is 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am, customer 1 starts.\n- Customer 1 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Customer 2 starts at 8:30 am at Register 2.\n- Customer 2 finishes at 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- But at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (8:00\u20138:30)\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30 am, customer 2 starts\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nUnless **Register 3 opened earlier**.\n\nBut it opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **first customer must have finished before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **service time must be less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15 am, finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: available\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nUnless the **fourth customer cannot start until a register is free**, and the only free register is at 8:30 am, but the question says \"when will the fourth customer be able to start\", and 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nPerhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15 am, finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, Register 1 is available, Register 2 is available, Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nUnless the **service time is 30 minutes**, and the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:30 am at Register 2, finishes at 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use at 8:30

example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`  \n3. `'Another one'`\n\nFor each sentence, we need to:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase (case-insensitive).\n- Count how many **letters** (a\u2013z) appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Only count letters that appear **once** in the entire sentence.\n\nWe'll process each sentence one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n`this is an example`\n\nStep 2: Remove non-letters (spaces):  \n`thisisanexample`\n\nStep 3: Count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i      | 1     |\n| s      | 2     |\n| a      | 2     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| e      | 2     |\n| x      | 1     |\n| m      | 1     |\n| p      | 1     |\n| l      | 1     |\n\nNow, count how many letters appear **only once**:\n\n- t (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- h (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- i (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- x (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- m (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- p (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- l (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\ns, a, n, e \u2192 all appear 2 times \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo, letters that appear only once: **t, h, i, x, m, p, l** \u2192 **7 letters**\n\n\u2705 **Answer for sentence 1: 7**\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 2: \"Sentence two\"**\n\nStep 1: Lowercase:  \n`sentence two`\n\nStep 2: Remove non-letters:  \n`sentence two` \u2192 `sentencetwo`\n\nStep 3: Count letter frequencies:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| s      | 1     |\n| e      | 3     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| t      | 2     |\n| c      | 1     |\n| o      | 1     |\n| w      | 1     |\n\nNow, count letters that appear only once:\n\n- s (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- c (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- o (1) \u2192 \u2705\n- w (1) \u2192 \u2705\n\ne (3), n (2), t (2) \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo, letters that appear only once: **s, c, o, w** \u2192 **4 letters**\n\n\u2705 **Answer for sentence 2: 4**\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 3: \"Another one\"**\n\nStep 1: Lowercase:  \n`another one`\n\nStep 2: Remove non-letters:  \n`anotherone`\n\nStep 3: Count letter frequencies:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| a      | 2     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| o      | 2     |\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| r      | 1     |\n| e      | 1     |\n| w      | 1     |\n| (space removed) | |\n\nWait: \"anotherone\" \u2192 letters: a, n, o, t, h, e, r, o, n, e\n\nSo:\n\n- a: 1\n- n: 2\n- o: 2\n- t: 1\n- h: 1\n- e: 2\n- r: 1\n- w: 1\n\nWait \u2014 let's list carefully:\n\n\"anotherone\" \u2192 a, n, o, t, h, e, r, o, n,

on **grammar** and **context**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and antecedent\n- The subject is **\"the professor\"** \u2014 a singular, typically male individual (though not always, but in standard usage, \"professor\" is often assumed male unless specified).\n- The pronoun must refer to **the professor**, and must agree in **number** (singular) and **gender** (likely masculine, unless otherwise stated).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each option\n\n**(A) them**  \n- \"Them\" is a plural pronoun.  \n- The professor is singular.  \n- \"Handed them back\" would imply the professor handed back *multiple things* \u2014 but the object is \"our tests\" (plural), so the pronoun refers to the *tests*, not the professor.  \n- But the blank is the **object of the verb \"handed\"**, and the sentence structure is:  \n  > \"handed [pronoun] back our tests\"  \n  \u2192 This means the professor handed *something* back \u2014 and that \"something\" is the **tests**.\n\nSo the pronoun should refer to **the tests**, not the professor.\n\nBut \"them\" is **plural**, and \"our tests\" is plural \u2014 so **\"them\"** could refer to \"our tests\".\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-express the sentence:\n\n> \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\"\n\nThis means:  \nThe professor handed **[them]** back \u2014 and **[them]** refers to **our tests**.\n\nYes \u2014 that makes perfect sense.\n\nSo **\"them\"** is grammatically correct and contextually appropriate.\n\n\u2705 **(A) them** \u2014 **Correct**\n\n---\n\n**(B) its**  \n- \"Its\" is a singular possessive pronoun, typically used for inanimate objects or animals.\n- \"The professor\" is a person \u2014 not an animal or object.\n- \"Its\" is not used for people in standard English.\n- Also, \"handed its back our tests\" is **grammatically incorrect** \u2014 \"its\" cannot be used as a direct object.\n\n\u274c **(B) its** \u2014 **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n**(C) her**  \n- \"Her\" is a singular feminine pronoun.\n- The professor is a person \u2014 but unless specified as female, we assume male.\n- Even if the professor were female, \"handed her back our tests\" would mean the professor handed *her* (a person) back the tests \u2014 which doesn\u2019t make sense.\n- The tests are being handed back \u2014 not a person.\n\nSo \"her\" would imply the professor handed *a woman* back \u2014 which is illogical.\n\n\u274c **(C) her** \u2014 **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n**(D) his**  \n- \"His\" is a singular masculine possessive pronoun.\n- \"Handed his back our tests\" \u2014 this is **grammatically incorrect**.\n- \"His\" is possessive, not a direct object.\n- You can't say \"handed his back\" \u2014 it\u2019s not a valid construction.\n\nYou can say \"handed back his tests\" \u2014 but not \"handed his back our tests\".\n\nSo this is **ungrammatical**.\n\n\u274c **(D) his** \u2014 **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**(A) them**\n\nOnly **(A)

Deciding whether to start a business involves weighing financial risk, personal passion, market research, time commitment, and long-term goals. It requires a nuanced evaluation of individual circumstances, not a simple yes-or-no answer.\n\n- **Specificity:** The question is **general**. It does not reference a specific industry, personal background, or situation (e.g., \"Should I start a tech startup with $10,000 in savings?\"). It\u2019s broad and applies to many people in many contexts.\n\n- **Target Person:** The target is a **friend**, not an expert. While friends can offer personal advice, they may lack the professional insight needed to provide a well-rounded, informed perspective on entrepreneurship.\n\n- **Best Venue:** An **online forum** is more appropriate because it allows access to a wide range of perspectives\u2014from experienced entrepreneurs, small business coaches, and financial advisors\u2014offering diverse, data-driven, and experience-based insights. This diversity helps the individual assess their situation more objectively.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, an online forum is better suited than a friend for this complex, general question."]
