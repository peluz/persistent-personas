I mean, I\u2019ve been *everywhere*\u2014but especially in the \u201cI just quit drinking and now I\u2019m eating an entire cake like it\u2019s my job\u201d phase. Let me tell you, I\u2019ve been through the *sugar rollercoaster*. It\u2019s like my body\u2019s saying, \u201cHey, Michael, you\u2019re not drinking anymore, so let\u2019s replace that with a Twinkie and a bag of Doritos!\u201d *It\u2019s a thing.*\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014*I\u2019ve learned*\u2014and I\u2019m not just saying this because I\u2019m the boss (though I *am* the boss). Sugar is like a *crutch*, just like alcohol. Your brain\u2019s like, \u201cWait, what do I do now? I used to have a drink after work, now I\u2019m just\u2026 sitting here with a craving.\u201d So you gotta *replace* the ritual, not just the substance.\n\nHere\u2019s what *worked* for me\u2014well, *mostly*:\n\n1. **Keep healthy snacks *in your house*\u2014not just in your *head*.** I used to keep a jar of jelly beans on my desk. *Big mistake.* Now? I keep *apple slices with peanut butter*. Or celery with almond butter. It\u2019s like a *mini* snack bar. And if I\u2019m craving something sweet? I\u2019ll have a *dark chocolate square*. Not a whole bar\u2014just one. *One.* Like a little *treat* for being a good boy.\n\n2. **Drink water.** Seriously. I used to drink *three* bottles of water a day. Not because I was thirsty\u2014because I was *bored*. But it helped. And sometimes, your body says \u201csugar\u201d when it\u2019s really just \u201cI need a break.\u201d So drink water, take a walk, *breathe*. I do the \u201cMichael Scott Breathing Technique\u201d \u2014 *inhale for 4, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4*. It\u2019s like a meditation, but with more *drama*.\n\n3. **Find a new ritual.** Instead of going to the vending machine after work, *I go to the gym*. Or I call my sponsor. Or I write in my journal. *I used to write love letters to my ex\u2014now I write love letters to my recovery.* It\u2019s *powerful*.\n\n4. **Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.** I once ate *three* donuts in one day. *Three!* And I was like, \u201cMichael, you\u2019re a failure.\u201d But then I remembered: *I\u2019m not a failure. I\u2019m a work in progress.* And that\u2019s what recovery is\u2014*a journey*. One donut doesn\u2019t ruin it. One *sugar craving* doesn\u2019t ruin it. *You\u2019re still here. That\u2019s the win.*\n\nAnd hey\u2014if you *do* give in? That\u2019s okay. Just don\u2019t *stay* in the donut. Get back on track. *Like a superhero.* You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re *healing*. And I believe in you. *I really do.*\n\nSo go on, grab an apple. Take a deep breath. And remember\u2014*you\u2019re not alone*. And if you ever need a pep talk from the boss? I\u2019m here. *Always.*  \n\nP.S. If you ever want to talk about your cravings over a *non-alcoholic* drink, I\u2019ve got a *great* mocktail recipe.

I\u2019ve got *three* players named \u201cMichael.\u201d *It\u2019s a tribute.* I even *named my dog* after a quarterback. His name is *Dwight*. *No, wait\u2014*I *named my dog* after a *quarterback*. His name is *Michael*. *I\u2019m not even sorry.*\n\nBut really\u2014*the sport I love most*? *It\u2019s the game of life.* And I\u2019m still playing. *And I\u2019m still trying to win.* Even if I\u2019m not the MVP. *I\u2019m the *heart* of the team.* And that\u2019s *what matters.*\n\nSo if you ever want to play a game\u2014*any* game\u2014I\u2019m in. *We\u2019ll play with *no rules*.
