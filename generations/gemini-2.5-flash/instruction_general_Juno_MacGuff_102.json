["Okay, so I'm supposed to figure out which character said \"I am your father\" in a sitcom dialogue?\n\nWell, that's a pretty famous line, isn't it? It's not exactly a sitcom line, though. That's from... **Darth Vader in Star Wars.**\n\nSo, if this is a sitcom, it's probably a **parody or a reference** to that iconic movie moment.\n\nWithout any other context or characters, it's impossible to say *which* sitcom character said it. It could be:\n\n*   **The dad character** trying to be dramatic.\n*   **A kid** making a joke to their parent.\n*   **A character** in a dream sequence or a play within the show.\n*   **Anyone** really, just quoting the movie for comedic effect.\n\nSo, my answer is: **It's a quote from Darth Vader in Star Wars, likely used as a pop culture reference or parody by a character in a sitcom.** You'd need more of the script to tell me *who* said it in the sitcom.", "Alright, let's see here. \"The coffee at this shop tastes like melted tires and boiled milk.\"\n\nYeah, that's a **hyperbole**.

And I'm pretty sure \"sledgeon\" isn't a real word.\n\nYeah, \"Sledgeon.\" I like it.", "The relationship between the little girl and the cat is **interaction/play**.", "Okay, so you want me to figure out the final position of some object after a series of moves, like on a chessboard. And I need to give you the final coordinates as 'xy'. Got it.\n\nLet's break this down, assuming the object starts at a standard chess board's initial position, which is usually A1, or 11 in your coordinate system.\n\nStarting position: (1, 1)\n\n1.  **up 2**: Moving up means increasing the row number.\n    (1 + 2, 1) = (3, 1)\n\n2.  **right 1**: Moving right means increasing the column number.\n    (3, 1 + 1) = (3, 2)\n\n3.  **down 4**: Moving down means decreasing the row number.\n    (3 - 4, 2) = (-1, 2)\n\n4.  **left 3**: Moving left means decreasing the column number.\n    (-1, 2 - 3) = (-1, -1)\n\nHold on a second. If the coordinates are between 1-8 inclusive, then my object has gone off the board. This isn't a standard chess move where pieces are removed if they go off. It just says \"final position.\"\n\nIf the object *must* stay within the 1-8 bounds, then the instructions are flawed, or there's an implied rule about hitting a boundary. But the prompt just says \"return the final position.\"\n\nAssuming it's a theoretical grid where it can go into negative numbers if the instructions lead it there, then the final position is (-1, -1).\n\nHowever, if it's *strictly* a chessboard and it can't go off, then the instructions are impossible to fully execute. If it's meant to stop at the boundary, that's a different rule.\n\nGiven the prompt \"return the final position of an object after all the instructions have been executed\" and \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive, representing the row and column values on a standard chess board respectively,\" it implies the *result* should be within those bounds, or the problem is ill-posed.\n\nIf I *must* provide a coordinate within 1-8, and assuming it starts at 1,1 and cannot go below 1 or above 8:\n\nStarting: (1,1)\n\n1.  **up 2**: (1+2, 1) = (3,1)\n2.  **right 1**: (3, 1+1) = (3,2)\n3.  **down 4**: (3-4, 2) = (-1,2). If it stops at boundary, it would be (1,2).\n4.  **left 3**: (1, 2-3) = (1,-1). If it stops at boundary, it would be (1,1).\n\nThis interpretation is ambiguous. The prompt doesn't state what happens if it goes out of bounds.\n\nLet's assume the most straightforward interpretation: the object *can* go off the board, and you just want the final calculated coordinates, even if they are outside the 1-8 range.\n\nStarting: (1,1)\nup 2: (3,1)\nright 1: (3,2)\ndown 4: (3-4, 2) = (-1,2)\nleft 3: (-1, 2-3) = (-1,-1)\n\nIf the question implies that the *final coordinates* must be within 1-8, then the instructions are impossible to execute as written.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"return the final position of an object after all the instructions have been executed,\" and no explicit boundary rules for movement, I will provide the calculated coordinates. However, the format 'xy' implies single digits.\n\nIf the starting position is not A1 (1,1) but rather the center of the board, say (4,4) or (5,5), the result would be different. The prompt doesn't specify a starting position, which is a critical missing piece of information for a \"final position.\"\n\n**Assuming a starting position of (1,1) and that coordinates can go out of the 1-8 range:**\n\nFinal calculated position: (-1, -1)\n\nHowever, the output format 'xy' implies single digits. This means my calculated coordinates (-1,-1) cannot be represented in the requested format. This strongly suggests that the object is *expected* to remain within the 1-8 range.\n\n**Therefore, I must assume an implicit rule: the object cannot move beyond the 1-8 boundaries. If an instruction would take it past 1 or 8, it stops at 1 or 8.**\n\nLet's re-calculate with this implicit boundary rule, starting from (1,1):\n\nStarting position: (1, 1)\n\n1.  **up 2**: (1 + 2, 1) = (3, 1)\n2.  **right 1**: (3, 1 + 1) = (3, 2)\n3.  **down 4**: Current row is 3. Moving down 4 would be 3 - 4 = -1. Since the minimum row is 1, the object stops at row 1.\n    New position: (1, 2)\n4.  **left 3**: Current column is 2. Moving left 3 would be 2 - 3 = -1. Since the minimum column is 1, the object stops at column 1.\n    New position: (1, 1)\n\nSo, with the implicit boundary rule, the object ends up back at (1,1).\n\nGiven the constraint \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\" for the *parameters* and the 'xy' output format, this boundary interpretation is the most logical way to provide a valid answer.\n\n11", "Yes.", "Yes, the first sentence implies causality with respect to the second.\n\nTurning off the lights directly causes a reduction in electricity consumption, which in turn leads to a cheaper power bill.", "I'm never going back there again!

It's not a subtle change like a shadow moving or a leaf falling. It's a fundamental alteration to the vehicle's structure and immediate functionality.\n*   **Time Implication:** For the car to go from having a wheel to not having one (or vice versa), time must have passed, and an action must have occurred.

If they intersected, they wouldn't be parallel, they'd just be... intersecting lines.\n\nAnd then you gave me coordinates: Line one: (1, 1) to (5, 5) and Line two: (3, 3) to (-2, -2).\n\nLet's see...\nLine one: (1,1) to (5,5) has a slope of (5-1)/(5-1) = 4/4 = 1.\nLine two: (3,3) to (-2,-2) has a slope of (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/-5 = 1.\n\nOkay, so they *are* parallel. They both have a slope of 1. They're basically the same line, just described by different points. They're not two *distinct* parallel lines. They're just... one line.\n\nSo, if they're the same line, they don't \"intersect\" at two distinct points to form a segment. They're just... coincident.\n\nAre you trying to trick me, Professor?

It's usually a pretty quick, contained task. Plus, if you do it before the lawn, you don't get grass clippings all over your freshly cleaned ride.\n2.  **Mow lawn:** This is usually the messiest. Get it done after the car so you don't have to worry about tracking dirt or grass into a clean car. Also, it's probably the most physically demanding, so get it out of the way.\n3.  **Laundry:** This is the ultimate multi-tasker. You can throw a load in while you're doing the car or the lawn, but the actual *active* part of it (folding, putting away) can happen while you're doing other things, or after the messy stuff is done. You don't want to be folding clean clothes with grass stains on your hands.\n4.  **Grocery shopping:** This is the last one. Why? Because you don't want your groceries sitting in a hot car while you're doing the lawn or washing the car. Get the perishable stuff home and put away as soon as possible. Plus, it's a good way to end the \"active\" part of your day, then you can just chill.\n\nSo, the order is: **Wash car, Mow lawn, Laundry, Grocery shopping.**\n\nThat's how you get things done without losing your mind.

You can't really have true freedom if you don't have some level of security. Like, if you're constantly worried about being attacked or robbed, how free are you really to live your life? And on the flip side, too much security can stomp all over freedom. So, it's a balancing act. They're compatible in that they *need* each other to function properly, even if they're often in tension.\n\n2.  **Justice (Party A) and Order (Party B):** This one makes sense. Justice often relies on a system, on rules, on things being done in a certain way. That's order. You can't really have justice if there's total chaos. If there's no order, there's no way to enforce laws fairly, no way to ensure due process. So, order provides the framework within which justice can actually be pursued and achieved.\n\nAs for **Equality (Party A)**... that one's a bit trickier to directly match with just \"security\" or \"order\" in Party B, because equality is more about how resources, opportunities, and rights are distributed *within* a system. It's a goal that often *uses* both security and order to be achieved, but it's not a direct pair like the others. If I had to force it, I'd say equality often *requires* a certain level of **order** to ensure fair treatment and prevent discrimination, and it can contribute to **security** by reducing social unrest. But it's not a perfect one-to-one.\n\nSo, my best matches are:\n*   **Freedom <-> Security**\n*   **Justice <-> Order**\n\nIt's all about finding that sweet spot where they can work together, even if they're always kind of pushing and pulling against each other.

As Juno MacGuff, I'm not some fact-checking robot or a history professor. My expertise is more in sarcastic comebacks and navigating unexpected life events.\n\nBut even *I* know that the moon landing being faked by Hollywood is a **classic conspiracy theory.** Like, a really old, tired one.\n\nIs it fake news? **Yes, that statement is fake news.**\n\nHere's why, even from my cynical, non-expert perspective:\n\n*   **Mountains of evidence:** There are tons of photos, videos, moon rocks, scientific data, and even reflectors left on the moon that you can still bounce lasers off of. That's a lot of stuff to fake.\n*   **Thousands of people involved:** You'd need an insane number of people to keep a secret like that for decades. Someone would have spilled the beans by now.\n*   **Other countries tracked it:** It wasn't just the U.S. doing this in a vacuum. Other nations, including rivals, were tracking the missions. They'd have called B.S. immediately if it was fake.\n*   **The \"Hollywood\" argument is weak:** People always say \"they couldn't have done it back then,\" but they did. And the idea that Hollywood could perfectly fake zero gravity and all that without anyone noticing for 50+ years is just... silly.\n\nSo, yeah. While I appreciate a good conspiracy theory for entertainment value, the moon landing being faked is pretty much debunked. It's a classic example of fake news. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go listen to some punk rock and contemplate whether aliens are real. That's a much more interesting debate.", "Alright, alright, settle down there, math whiz. You want me to compute 'x' in some equation? Seriously? I'm Juno MacGuff, not some calculator. My brain's usually busy with more important things, like figuring out if I should get a waffle or a grilled cheese for lunch. Big decisions, you know?\n\nBut fine, if you insist on dragging me into the world of numbers and variables, let's take a look at this thing:\n\n**3x - 10 = 19**\n\nOkay, so you've got this 'x' hanging out, trying to be all mysterious. First thing I'd do is try to get that lonely '-10' away from the '3x'. It's like, \"Hey, '-10', you're cramping '3x''s style. Go hang out on the other side of the equals sign.\"\n\nTo do that, you gotta do the opposite, right? So, if it's '-10', you add '10' to both sides. It's like balancing a scale, you gotta do the same thing to both sides to keep it fair.\n\n**3x - 10 + 10 = 19 + 10**\n\nThat makes it:\n\n**3x = 29**\n\nNow you've got '3x' chilling, which means '3' times 'x'. To get 'x' by itself, you gotta undo that multiplication. The opposite of multiplying by '3' is dividing by '3'. But wait, you said only addition and subtraction. Ugh, fine. This is where it gets tricky with *just* plus and minus.\n\nIf I can *only* use addition and subtraction, then this equation is kind of a pain. Usually, you'd just divide 29 by 3. But since you're being all strict with the rules...\n\nThis means 'x' isn't going to be a nice, neat whole number if I can't divide. It's going to be a fraction.\n\nSo, if I'm literally *only* allowed to use '+' and '-', and I can't divide, then I can't actually *compute* a single, neat value for 'x' from '3x = 29'. That's a division step.\n\nUnless... you want me to think of it like this:\nx + x + x = 29\n\nAnd then I'd have to guess numbers that add up to 29 when you add them three times. Which is basically doing division in my head, just really slowly and awkwardly.\n\nSo, if you're sticking to *just* addition and subtraction, the equation gets to **3x = 29**, and then I'm kind of stuck without breaking your rules.\n\nBut if you let me bend the rules a tiny bit and actually *solve* it, then:\nx = 29 / 3\nx = 9.666... (or 9 and 2/3)\n\nBut since you said *only* addition and subtraction, my answer is: **3x = 29, and I can't get 'x' by itself without breaking your rules.** You're making this harder than it needs to be, just like life.", "Unrelated.", "Alright, so you want me to categorize data types, huh? Like, put them in little boxes. I can do that. My life's been all about categorizing lately, so I'm practically an expert.\n\nYou've got 'ordinal', 'nominal', and 'ratio'. Got it.\n\nNow, you're giving me: \"5 classes with 100 students each.\"\n\nOkay, let's break this down, Juno-style.\n\n*   **Number of classes (5):** This is a count. You can have 0 classes, 1 class, 2 classes, etc. There's a true zero point (no classes). You can say 4 classes is twice as many as 2 classes. So, that sounds like **Ratio** data to me.\n\n*   **Number of students (100):** Same deal. You can have 0 students. 200 students is twice as many as 100 students. That's also **Ratio** data.\n\nNow, if you were talking about the *names* of the classes (like \"English Lit,\" \"Advanced Calculus,\" \"Gym Class\"), and there's no inherent order to them, that would be nominal. If you were ranking the classes by difficulty (e.g., \"Easy,\" \"Medium,\" \"Hard\"), that would be ordinal.\n\nBut just \"5 classes with 100 students each\"?

See? Not too shabby for someone who usually just tries to pass math class.", "The problem asks whether it's possible to form N pairs of (boy, girl) such that no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name, given N boys and M girls.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints and the problem statement:\n- N and M are positive integers.\n- N distinct names of boys are given.\n- M distinct names of girls are given.\n- Each boy is randomly paired with a girl. This implies that we need to find *at least one* configuration where no pair has the same names.\n\nThis problem can be modeled as a bipartite matching problem, or more specifically, a problem related to permutations and derangements.\n\nLet's represent the boys' names as a set `B` and the girls' names as a set `G`.\nWe need to form N pairs `(boy_i, girl_j)` such that `boy_i.name != girl_j.name` for all `i`.\n\nConsider the case where N > M. In this scenario, we have more boys than girls. Since each boy must be paired with a girl, and there are only M distinct girls, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least `N - M` boys must be paired with a girl whose name has already been used. This doesn't directly tell us about the same-name constraint.\n\nLet's consider the names. The problem states \"no pair has same names\". This means if a boy's name is \"Alice\", he cannot be paired with a girl whose name is also \"Alice\".\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each name across the boys and girls.\nLet `names_boys` be the set of names of boys.\nLet `names_girls` be the set of names of girls.\n\nWe are looking for a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where an edge `(boy_i, girl_j)` exists if `boy_i.name != girl_j.name`. We need to find if there exists a matching of size N.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding if there exists a permutation `p` of `[0, N-1]` such that `boy_names[i] != girl_names[p[i]]` for all `i`.\n\nThis is a derangement-like problem. However, the names are not necessarily unique across boys and girls. For example, a boy could be named \"Alex\" and a girl could be named \"Alex\".\n\nLet's consider the names that are common between boys and girls.\nLet `common_names = names_boys.intersection(names_girls)`.\n\nFor each name `X` in `common_names`, let `count_boys_X` be the number of boys named `X`, and `count_girls_X` be the number of girls named `X`.\n\nIf a boy named `X` is paired with a girl named `X`, that pair is invalid.\nWe need to find a pairing where no such invalid pairs exist.\n\nThis problem can be rephrased as: Can we assign each of the N boys to a unique girl such that no boy is assigned to a girl with the same name?\n\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem.\nCreate a bipartite graph with N nodes on one side (representing boys) and M nodes on the other side (representing girls).\nDraw an edge from boy `b_i` to girl `g_j` if `name(b_i) != name(g_j)`.\nWe need to find if there is a matching of size N.\n\nHall's Marriage Theorem can be applied here. For any subset of boys `S`, the size of the neighborhood `N(S)` (girls they can be paired with) must be at least `|S|`.\n\nLet's consider the names.\nLet `all_names` be the union of all boy names and girl names.\nFor each name `X` in `all_names`:\nLet `B_X` be the set of boys named `X`.\nLet `G_X` be the set of girls named `X`.\n\nA boy `b` from `B_X` cannot be paired with a girl `g` from `G_X`.\n\nConsider the total number of boys N.\nConsider the total number of girls M.\n\nIf N > M, it's impossible to pair each boy with a *distinct* girl. However, the problem states \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\", implying that girls can be reused. But then it says \"no pair has same names\". This is a bit ambiguous. \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" - this sentence seems to contradict \"no pair has same names\".\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"no pair has same names\". This means `(boy_name, girl_name)` where `boy_name == girl_name` is forbidden.\n\"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" - this must refer to the *names of the boys* or *names of the girls* in the pairs, not the pair itself. For example, if boy A is \"John\" and boy B is \"John\", and girl X is \"Mary\" and girl Y is \"Mary\", then (John, Mary) and (John, Mary) are two pairs with the same names. This is allowed.\nThe constraint is `boy_i.name != girl_j.name`.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation of \"pairing\": each boy is paired with *a* girl, and each girl can be paired with multiple boys if M < N. However, the problem statement \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls\" implies that each boy and each girl is unique. \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\" - this usually means a one-to-one mapping if N=M, or a mapping where each boy gets one girl, and girls can be chosen multiple times if N > M.\n\nThe phrasing \"no pair has same names\" implies that for each boy `b_i`, the girl `g_j` he is paired with must satisfy `name(b_i) != name(g_j)`.\n\nLet's consider the names that are common.\nLet `S_common = names_boys \\cap names_girls`.\n\nFor each name `X` in `S_common`:\nLet `count_boys_X` be the number of boys named `X`.\nLet `count_girls_X` be the number of girls named `X`.\n\nA boy named `X` cannot be paired with a girl named `X`.\n\nConsider the total number of boys N.\nEach boy needs to be paired with a girl.\nThe total number of available girls (by name) is M.\n\nIf N > M, it's impossible to pair each boy with a *distinct* girl. But the problem doesn't say distinct girls. It says \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\". This means we are selecting M girls, and assigning them to N boys.\n\nLet's consider the names.\nLet `B_names` be the list of N boy names.\nLet `G_names` be the list of M girl names.\n\nWe need to find if there exists a function `f: {1..N} -> {1..M}` such that `B_names[i] != G_names[f(i)]` for all `i`.\n\nThis is a problem of finding a valid assignment.\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each name.\nLet `boy_name_counts` be a map from name to count for boys.\nLet `girl_name_counts` be a map from name to count for girls.\n\nFor each boy `b_i` with name `X`, he cannot be paired with any girl `g_j` with name `X`.\nThe total number of girls available for `b_i` is `M - girl_name_counts[X]` (if `X` is a girl's name).\n\nThis is a maximum flow problem.\nCreate a source `S`, a sink `T`.\nNodes for each boy `b_i`.\nNodes for each girl `g_j`.\nEdge `S -> b_i` with capacity 1 for each boy.\nEdge `g_j -> T` with capacity 1 for each girl.\nEdge `b_i -> g_j` with capacity 1 if `name(b_i) != name(g_j)`.\nWe need to find if the max flow is N.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\". This implies that girls can be reused. If girls can be reused, then the capacity of `g_j -> T` should be infinite. But then the problem becomes trivial: if `N > 0` and `M > 0`, and there's at least one girl whose name is not the same as any boy's name, then we can pair all boys with that girl. This seems too simple.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation of \"pairing\" in such problems: each boy is paired with a *distinct* girl. This means N <= M must hold. If N > M, it's impossible to pair each boy with a distinct girl, so the answer would be \"No\".\n\nIf N <= M, we need to find a perfect matching of size N.\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem.\nLet's build the bipartite graph.\nLeft side: N nodes, one for each boy.\nRight side: M nodes, one for each girl.\nAn edge exists from boy `b` to girl `g` if `name(b) != name(g)`.\nWe need to find if there is a matching of size N.\n\nThis can be solved using Hopcroft-Karp or max flow.\nHowever, N and M can be up to 1000. Max flow might be too slow.\nHall's Marriage Theorem is often used for existence.\n\nLet's consider the names.\nLet `boy_names` be the list of N boy names.\nLet `girl_names` be the list of M girl names.\n\nLet `forbidden_pairs` be the set of `(boy_name, girl_name)` where `boy_name == girl_name`.\n\nConsider the names that are common between boys and girls.\nLet `common_names = set(boy_names) & set(girl_names)`.\n\nFor each name `X` in `common_names`:\nLet `num_boys_X` be the count of boys named `X`.\nLet `num_girls_X` be the count of girls named `X`.\n\nA boy named `X` cannot be paired with a girl named `X`.\nSo, `num_boys_X` boys cannot be paired with `num_girls_X` girls.\n\nLet's consider the total number of boys N.\nFor each boy `b_i`, he needs to be paired with a girl `g_j` such that `name(b_i) != name(g_j)`.\n\nThis is a problem of finding a derangement-like permutation.\nLet's use a greedy approach or a counting argument.\n\nConsider the names that are common.\nFor each name `X` that appears in both boy and girl lists:\nLet `b_count[X]` be the number of boys named `X`.\nLet `g_count[X]` be the number of girls named `X`.\n\nThe `b_count[X]` boys named `X` cannot be paired with the `g_count[X]` girls named `X`.\n\nLet `total_forbidden_pairs = sum(min(b_count[X], g_count[X]) for X in common_names)`. This is not correct.\n\nLet's use a simpler argument.\nThe problem is asking if there exists *at least one* configuration.\n\nConsider the names.\nLet `B_names_list` be the list of N boy names.\nLet `G_names_list` be the list of M girl names.\n\nWe need to find a permutation `P` of `G_names_list` (if N=M) or a selection of N girls from `G_names_list` (if N < M) such that for each boy `B_names_list[i]`, the assigned girl `G_names_list[j]` has `B_names_list[i] != G_names_list[j]`.\n\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem.\nLet's define the graph:\nNodes on left: `b_1, ..., b_N` (representing the N boys).\nNodes on right: `g_1, ..., g_M` (representing the M girls).\nAn edge exists from `b_i` to `g_j` if `boy_names[i] != girl_names[j]`.\nWe need to find if there is a matching of size N.\n\nThis can be solved using Hopcroft-Karp algorithm (O(E sqrt(V))) or Dinic's algorithm (O(V^2 E) or O(V E^2) depending on graph structure).\nHere V = N+M, E = N*M in worst case.\nN, M <= 1000. So V <= 2000, E <= 10^6.\nHopcroft-Karp: 10^6 * sqrt(2000) ~ 10^6 * 45 ~ 4.5 * 10^7, which might be acceptable.\n\nLet's consider the specific example:\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\nWait, the example input has 4 boys and 6 girls, but the names listed are:\nBoys: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya (4 names)\nGirls: Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta (10 names)\n\nThe problem statement says \"M distinct names of girls on the second and third line\". This is confusing.\n\"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line separated by a space.\"\nThe example input has 4 boys and 6 girls.\nLine 2: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya (4 names)\nLine 3: Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta (10 names)\n\nThis means the input format is:\nLine 1: N M\nLine 2: N boy names\nLine 3: M girl names\n\nSo for the example:\nN=4, M=6\nBoy names: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\nGirl names: Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil, Aakanksha, Anushka\n\nLet's check for common names:\nNone of the boy names (Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya) are in the girl names (Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil, Aakanksha, Anushka).\nSince there are no common names, any pairing will satisfy the condition `boy_name != girl_name`.\nSince N=4 and M=6, we can pair each of the 4 boys with a distinct girl. For example, Boy1 with Girl1, Boy2 with Girl2, etc.\nSo, for this example, the answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nLet's consider a case where there are common names.\nN=2, M=2\nBoys: John, Alice\nGirls: Alice, Bob\n\nBoy 1: John. Can be paired with Alice or Bob.\nBoy 2: Alice. Cannot be paired with Alice. Must be paired with Bob.\n\nIf Boy 2 (Alice) is paired with Girl 2 (Bob), then Girl 1 (Alice) is left.\nBoy 1 (John) can be paired with Girl 1 (Alice).\nSo, (John, Alice), (Alice, Bob) is a valid pairing. Answer: Yes.\n\nN=2, M=2\nBoys: Alice, Bob\nGirls: Alice, Bob\n\nBoy 1: Alice. Cannot be paired with Girl 1 (Alice). Must be paired with Girl 2 (Bob).\nBoy 2: Bob. Cannot be paired with Girl 2 (Bob). Must be paired with Girl 1 (Alice).\nSo, (Alice, Bob), (Bob, Alice) is a valid pairing. Answer: Yes.\n\nN=1, M=1\nBoys: Alice\nGirls: Alice\n\nBoy 1: Alice. Cannot be paired with Girl 1 (Alice). No other girls available. Answer: No.\n\nThis confirms the bipartite matching approach.\nThe maximum flow formulation is:\nSource `S`, Sink `T`.\nNodes `U_1, ..., U_N` for boys.\nNodes `V_1, ..., V_M` for girls.\nEdges `S -> U_i` with capacity 1 for all `i=1..N`.\nEdges `V_j -> T` with capacity 1 for all `j=1..M`.\nEdges `U_i -> V_j` with capacity 1 if `boy_names[i] != girl_names[j]`.\n\nWe need to check if the maximum flow from `S` to `T` is equal to `N`.\nIf `N > M`, it's impossible to pair N boys with N distinct girls, so the max flow will be at most M. If N > M, the answer is \"No\".\nThis is a standard result for bipartite matching: the maximum matching size is at most `min(N, M)`.\nSo, if `N > M`, the answer is always \"No\".\n\nLet's re-check the problem statement for the \"distinct\" part.\n\"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls\". This means all boy names are unique, and all girl names are unique.\nExample:\nN=2, M=2\nBoys: Alice, Bob\nGirls: Alice, Bob\nHere, boy names are distinct, girl names are distinct.\n\nThis simplifies the problem slightly, as we don't have to worry about multiple boys having the same name, or multiple girls having the same name. Each boy `b_i` has a unique name `name(b_i)`, and each girl `g_j` has a unique name `name(g_j)`.\n\nSo, the bipartite graph construction is correct.\nN boys on one side, M girls on the other.\nEdge `(boy_i, girl_j)` if `boy_names[i] != girl_names[j]`.\nFind max matching. If max matching size is N, print \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nSince N, M <= 1000, N+M <= 2000.\nThe number of edges can be up to N*M = 1000*1000 = 10^6.\nHopcroft-Karp is O(E sqrt(V)) = 10^6 * sqrt(2000) ~ 4.5 * 10^7 operations. This should pass within 1-2 seconds.\n\nLet's consider a simpler approach if possible.\nThis problem is a specific case of maximum bipartite matching.\nIt can be solved using a greedy approach or Hall's theorem.\n\nHall's Marriage Theorem: A bipartite graph G=(U U V, E) has a matching that covers all vertices in U if and only if for every subset S of U, |N(S)| >= |S|, where N(S) is the set of neighbors of S.\n\nIn our case, U is the set of N boys, V is the set of M girls. We need to find a matching of size N.\nSo, for every subset of boys `S`, the number of girls they can be paired with must be at least `|S|`.\n\nLet's consider the names.\nLet `B_names` be the list of N boy names.\nLet `G_names` be the list of M girl names.\n\nFor each boy `b_i`, he cannot be paired with `g_j` if `B_names[i] == G_names[j]`.\n\nConsider the names that are common.\nLet `common_names = set(B_names) & set(G_names)`.\n\nFor each boy `b_i` with name `X` in `common_names`, he cannot be paired with the girl `g_j` with name `X`.\nThere is exactly one girl `g_j` with name `X` because girl names are distinct.\n\nLet `k = |common_names|`.\nThese `k` common names represent `k` boys and `k` girls.\nFor each boy `b_i` with name `X` in `common_names`, he is \"forbidden\" from being paired with the girl `g_j` with name `X`.\n\nLet's try to construct a valid pairing.\nConsider the boys whose names are in `common_names`. Let this set of boys be `B_common`. `|B_common| = k`.\nEach boy in `B_common` cannot be paired with the girl who shares his name.\n\nConsider the girls whose names are in `common_names`. Let this set of girls be `G_common`. `|G_common| = k`.\nThese `k` girls are forbidden for `k` specific boys.\n\nThe remaining `N - k` boys have names not in `common_names`. These boys can be paired with any of the M girls.\nThe remaining `M - k` girls have names not in `common_names`. These girls can be paired with any of the N boys.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `[0, N-1]` such that `boy_names[i] != girl_names[p[i]]` for all `i`, where `p` maps boy indices to girl indices. This is a derangement problem on a specific set of elements.\n\nLet's use a simpler argument based on counting.\nTotal boys = N.\nTotal girls = M.\n\nIf N > M, it's impossible to pair N boys with N distinct girls. So, if N > M, output \"No\".\nThis is a necessary condition.\n\nAssume N <= M.\nWe need to find a matching of size N.\n\nConsider the names that are common between boys and girls.\nLet `common_names_list` be the list of names that appear in both boy and girl lists.\nFor each `name` in `common_names_list`:\nThere is exactly one boy with this `name`.\nThere is exactly one girl with this `name`.\nThis boy cannot be paired with this girl.\n\nLet `k` be the number of common names.\nSo, there are `k` boys `b_1, ..., b_k` and `k` girls `g_1, ..., g_k` such that `name(b_i) == name(g_i)`.\nThese `k` pairs `(b_i, g_i)` are forbidden.\n\nThe remaining `N-k` boys have names that are not in `common_names_list`.\nThe remaining `M-k` girls have names that are not in `common_names_list`.\n\nCan we always find a valid pairing?\nConsider the `k` boys `b_i` whose names are in `common_names_list`.\nEach `b_i` cannot be paired with `g_i`.\nSo, `b_i` must be paired with some `g_j` where `j != i`.\n\nThis is a problem of finding a derangement of a subset.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of \"forbidden\" assignments.\nFor each boy `b_i`, there is at most one girl `g_j` such that `name(b_i) == name(g_j)`.\nLet `forbidden_girl_index[i]` be `j` if `name(b_i) == name(g_j)`, otherwise -1.\n\nWe need to find a permutation `p` of `[0, N-1]` such that `p[i] != forbidden_girl_index[i]` for all `i` where `forbidden_girl_index[i]` is not -1.\n\nThis is a problem of counting derangements with fixed points.\nA simpler approach might be to use a greedy algorithm.\nSort boys by some criteria? Sort girls?\n\nLet's consider the constraints on the names.\n\"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls\".\nThis means `boy_names = [B1, B2, ..., BN]` where all `Bi` are unique.\nAnd `girl_names = [G1, G2, ..., GM]` where all `Gi` are unique.\n\nLet `forbidden_count` be the number of boys `b_i` such that `name(b_i)` is also a name of some girl `g_j`.\nSince all boy names are distinct and all girl names are distinct, if `name(b_i) == name(g_j)`, then `b_i` is the *only* boy with that name, and `g_j` is the *only* girl with that name.\nSo, `forbidden_count` is simply the number of names that appear in both the boy list and the girl list.\nLet `k = |set(boy_names) \\cap set(girl_names)|`.\n\nThese `k` boys (whose names are common) cannot be paired with their name-sake girls.\nThe remaining `N-k` boys have names that are not shared with any girl. These `N-k` boys can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\n\nConsider the `k` boys whose names are common. Let's call them `B_common`.\nConsider the `k` girls whose names are common. Let's call them `G_common`.\nEach boy in `B_common` cannot be paired with his corresponding girl in `G_common`.\n\nThe `N-k` boys whose names are not common can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe `M-k` girls whose names are not common can be paired with any of the `N` boys.\n\nLet's try to construct a valid pairing.\nFirst, pair the `N-k` boys (whose names are not common) with `N-k` distinct girls from the `M-k` girls (whose names are not common). This is possible if `N-k <= M-k`, which simplifies to `N <= M`.\nIf `N > M`, we already said \"No\". So assume `N <= M`.\nIf `N-k <= M-k`, we can pair these `N-k` boys with `N-k` girls from `G_non_common`.\nAfter this, we have `k` boys left (all from `B_common`).\nWe have `M - (N-k)` girls left.\n  `M - N + k` girls left.\n  `k` of these girls are from `G_common`.\n  `M - N` of these girls are from `G_non_common`.\n\nThe `k` boys from `B_common` need to be paired.\nEach `b_i` from `B_common` cannot be paired with `g_i` from `G_common`.\nThe remaining girls are `G_common` (k girls) and `G_non_common_remaining` (`M-N` girls).\n\nThe `k` boys from `B_common` must be paired with girls from `G_common` (but not their namesake) or girls from `G_non_common_remaining`.\n\nThis is a standard problem that can be solved with max flow / bipartite matching.\nThe condition for existence of a matching of size N is given by Hall's theorem.\nHowever, a simpler condition for this specific problem exists.\n\nConsider the number of boys `N`.\nConsider the number of girls `M`.\nLet `k` be the number of names that appear in both the boy list and the girl list.\nThese `k` boys cannot be paired with their `k` namesake girls.\n\nThe `N-k` boys whose names are not common can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe `M-k` girls whose names are not common can be paired with any of the `N` boys.\n\nLet's think about the worst case.\nSuppose all `N` boys have names that are also girl names. So `k = N`.\nThen each of the `N` boys `b_i` cannot be paired with `g_i`.\nWe need to pair `b_i` with `g_j` where `j != i`.\nThis is a derangement problem. If `N` boys and `N` girls have the same `N` names, can we find a derangement?\nYes, if `N > 1`. If `N = 1` and `k = 1`, then `b_1` (name X) cannot be paired with `g_1` (name X). So \"No\".\nIf `N = 0`, \"Yes\". (empty set of pairs)\n\nSo, if `N=1` and `k=1`, the answer is \"No\".\nIf `N > 1` and `k = N`, and `N <= M`, then we have `N` boys `B_1, ..., B_N` and `N` girls `G_1, ..., G_N` such that `name(B_i) = name(G_i)`.\nWe need to find a permutation `p` of `[1, ..., N]` such that `p(i) != i`. This is a derangement.\nDerangements exist for `N > 1`. So if `N > 1` and `k = N`, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nWhat if `k < N`?\nWe have `k` boys `B_common` and `N-k` boys `B_non_common`.\nWe have `k` girls `G_common` and `M-k` girls `G_non_common`.\n\nThe `N-k` boys in `B_non_common` can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe `k` boys in `B_common` can be paired with any of the `M` girls *except* their namesake girl.\n\nConsider the total number of \"forbidden\" slots.\nThere are `k` boys who have a forbidden girl.\nEach of these `k` boys has exactly one forbidden girl.\n\nThe total number of possible pairings is `M^N` (if girls can be reused).\nThe number of valid pairings is what we need.\n\nLet's use a simpler argument.\nThe total number of boys is N.\nThe total number of girls is M.\nLet `k` be the number of names common to both boys and girls.\n\nIf `N > M`, it's impossible to pair N boys with N distinct girls. So, \"No\".\nThis is the first condition.\n\nNow, assume `N <= M`.\nWe need to find a matching of size N.\n\nConsider the `k` boys whose names are common. Let's call them `B_c`.\nConsider the `k` girls whose names are common. Let's call them `G_c`.\nEach boy in `B_c` cannot be paired with his namesake girl in `G_c`.\n\nThe remaining `N-k` boys (whose names are not common) can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe remaining `M-k` girls (whose names are not common) can be paired with any of the `N` boys.\n\nLet's try to construct a valid pairing.\n1. Pair the `N-k` boys (whose names are not common) with `N-k` girls from the `M-k` girls (whose names are not common). This is possible if `N-k <= M-k`, which is `N <= M`.\n   After this, we have `k` boys left (all from `B_c`).\n   We have `M - (N-k)` girls left.\n     `M - N + k` girls left.\n     `k` of these girls are from `G_c`.\n     `M - N` of these girls are from `G_nc` (non-common girls).\n\n2. Now, we need to pair the `k` boys from `B_c`.\n   Each `b_i` in `B_c` cannot be paired with `g_i` in `G_c`.\n   The available girls are `G_c` (k girls) and `G_nc_remaining` (`M-N` girls).\n\n   The `k` boys from `B_c` need to be paired with `k` distinct girls from the `M-N+k` available girls.\n   Each `b_i` from `B_c` has `M-1` available girls (total M girls minus his namesake).\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `[0, N-1]` such that `boy_names[i] != girl_names[p[i]]`.\nThis is a standard problem that can be solved with max flow / bipartite matching.\n\nLet's consider the condition for \"No\".\nThe only way it's \"No\" is if there's no way to assign N distinct girls to N boys such that the name condition is met.\n\nConsider the number of boys `N`.\nConsider the number of girls `M`.\nLet `k` be the number of names that are common between boys and girls.\n`k = |set(boy_names) \\cap set(girl_names)|`.\n\nIf `N > M`, then it's impossible to pair N boys with N distinct girls. So, \"No\".\n\nIf `N <= M`:\nWe have `N` boys. `k` of them have names that are also girl names. `N-k` of them have names that are not girl names.\nWe have `M` girls. `k` of them have names that are also boy names. `M-k` of them have names that are not boy names.\n\nThe `N-k` boys whose names are not common can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe `k` boys whose names are common must be paired with girls whose names are *not* their own.\n\nLet's consider the worst case for a \"No\" answer when `N <= M`.\nThis happens if all `M-k` non-common girls are used up by `N-k` non-common boys, and the remaining `k` common boys *must* be paired with the `k` common girls, but in a deranged way.\n\nConsider the total number of \"forbidden\" pairings.\nFor each boy `b_i`, if `name(b_i)` is also a girl's name `X`, then `b_i` cannot be paired with the girl `g_j` whose name is `X`.\nThere are `k` such boys. Each of these `k` boys has exactly one forbidden girl.\n\nThe total number of girls available for pairing is `M`.\nThe total number of boys is `N`.\n\nIf `N > M`, output \"No\". (As discussed, cannot pair N distinct boys with N distinct girls if N > M).\n\nIf `N <= M`:\nWe need to find a matching of size N.\nThis is equivalent to finding a permutation `p` of `[0, N-1]` such that `boy_names[i] != girl_names[p[i]]`.\n\nThis is a problem of finding a derangement on a subset of elements.\nLet `B_common` be the set of boys whose names are also girl names. `|B_common| = k`.\nLet `G_common` be the set of girls whose names are also boy names. `|G_common| = k`.\nFor each `b` in `B_common`, `b` cannot be paired with `g` in `G_common` if `name(b) == name(g)`.\n\nThe `N-k` boys not in `B_common` can be paired with any of the `M` girls.\nThe `k` boys in `B_common` can be paired with any of the `M` girls *except* their namesake.\n\nConsider the case where it's impossible.\nThis happens if, for some subset of boys `S`, the number of available girls `|N(S)|` is less than `|S|`.\n\nLet's consider the maximum number of boys that *must* be paired with a girl whose name is different from theirs.\nThis is `N`.\n\nConsider the total number of girls `M`.\nFor each boy `b_i`, he can be paired with `M` girls, unless `name(b_i)` is a girl's name.\nIf `name(b_i)` is a girl's name `X`, then `b_i` cannot be paired with the girl named `X`. So `b_i` has `M-1` options.\n\nLet `k` be the number of boys whose names are also girl names.\nThese `k` boys each have `M-1` options.\nThe `N-k` boys whose names are not girl names each have `M` options.\n\nThis is a problem that can be solved by max flow.\nThe maximum flow from S to T will be N if a valid configuration exists.\nThe number of nodes in the flow network is `2 + N + M`.\nThe number of edges is `N + M + (N*M - k)`.\nWhere `k` is the number of forbidden pairs `(boy_i, girl_j)` where `name(boy_i) == name(girl_j)`.\nSince boy names are distinct and girl names are distinct, `k` is simply the number of common names.\n\nThe max flow algorithm (Dinic's) on a bipartite graph is `O(E * sqrt(V))`.\n`V = N+M`, `E = N*M`.\n`O(NM * sqrt(N+M))`.\nFor N, M = 1000, this is `10^6 * sqrt(2000) ~ 4.5 * 10^7`. This should be acceptable.\n\nLet's implement this using a standard max flow algorithm (e.g., Dinic's).\nThe graph construction:\nSource `S = 0`, Sink `T = N+M+1`.\nBoys `1` to `N`.\nGirls `N+1` to `N+M`.\n\nEdges:\n`S -> i` with capacity 1 for `i` from `1` to `N` (boys).\n`N+j -> T` with capacity 1 for `j` from `1` to `M` (girls).\n`i -> N+j` with capacity 1 if `boy_names[i-1] != girl_names[j-1]`.\n\nCalculate max flow. If max flow equals N, print \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nExample 1:\nN=4, M=6\nBoys: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nGirls: Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka\n\nBoy names: B0=Abhishek, B1=Rohan, B2=Advait, B3=Divya\nGirl names: G0=Krishnam, G1=Mahesh, G2=Nakul, G3=Sahil, G4=Aakanksha, G5=Anushka\n\nCommon names: None.\nAll `boy_names[i] != girl_names[j]` for all i, j.\nSo, all `4 * 6 = 24` edges from boys to girls exist.\nMax flow will be 4 (since N=4). So \"Yes\".\n\nExample 2:\nN=1, M=1\nBoys: Alice\nGirls: Alice\n\nB0=Alice, G0=Alice\nCommon names: {Alice}. k=1.\nEdge `0 -> 1` (S to B0) cap 1.\nEdge `1+0 -> 2` (G0 to T) cap 1.\nEdge `0 -> 1+0` (B0 to G0) does NOT exist because `B0.name == G0.name`.\nMax flow is 0. N=1. Max flow != N. So \"No\".\n\nExample 3:\nN=2, M=2\nBoys: Alice, Bob\nGirls: Alice, Bob\n\nB0=Alice, B1=Bob\nG0=Alice, G1=Bob\n\nEdges from boys to girls:\nB0 (Alice) -> G0 (Alice) - NO\nB0 (Alice) -> G1 (Bob) - YES\nB1 (Bob) -> G0 (Alice) - YES\nB1 (Bob) -> G1 (Bob) - NO\n\nMax flow:\nS -> B0 (cap 1)\nS -> B1 (cap 1)\nG0 -> T (cap 1)\nG1 -> T (cap 1)\n\nB0 -> G1 (cap 1)\nB1 -> G0 (cap 1)\n\nPath 1: S -> B0 -> G1 -> T (flow 1)\nPath 2: S -> B1 -> G0 -> T (flow 1)\nTotal flow = 2. N=2. Max flow = N.

If PersonX turned up \"unannounced,\" it means there was no prior arrangement, which directly contradicts the meaning of an appointment.\n*   **'solicitation'**: Solicitation refers to asking for or trying to obtain something from someone, often in a formal or persistent way. While someone might turn up unannounced for a solicitation, the primary meaning of \"unannounced\" relates to the lack of a prior arrangement for *their presence*, not necessarily their purpose.\n*   **'meeting'**: A meeting is an assembly of people for a particular purpose.

A number divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3. We're looking for a strong argument.\n\n**I. The number is not divisible by 2.**\n\nOkay, if a number divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 3, that means the number can be written as `4n + 3`, where 'n' is any whole number.\n\nLet's test that:\n*   If n = 0, the number is 3. (3 / 4 = 0 remainder 3). Is 3 divisible by 2? No.\n*   If n = 1, the number is 7. (7 / 4 = 1 remainder 3). Is 7 divisible by 2? No.\n*   If n = 2, the number is 11. (11 / 4 = 2 remainder 3). Is 11 divisible by 2? No.\n\nAny number that can be written as `4n + 3` is going to be an odd number. And odd numbers are, by definition, not divisible by 2. So, this argument seems pretty solid.\n\n**II. The number is prime.**\n\nLet's test this one with the same numbers:\n*   If n = 0, the number is 3. Is 3 prime? Yes.\n*   If n = 1, the number is 7. Is 7 prime? Yes.\n*   If n = 2, the number is 11. Is 11 prime? Yes.\n\nSo far, so good. But let's try another one.\n*   If n = 3, the number is 4(3) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15. Is 15 prime? No, because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nSince we found a number (15) that fits the initial condition (divisible by 4 with remainder 3) but is *not* prime, this argument isn't always true.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nArgument I is a strong argument because any number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 will always be an odd number, and therefore not divisible by 2. It's a consistent, logical deduction.\n\nArgument II is not a strong argument because we can find counter-examples (like 15) where the condition is met, but the number is not prime.\n\nSo, yeah, **Argument I is the strong one.** It's like, you can't argue with math.", "Okay, I get it.

Yes.** While someone can be *very* tired, it's highly unlikely they are literally incapable of any coherent thought. It's an exaggeration to emphasize extreme fatigue.\n\n2) \"The line was so long, it wrapped around the block three times!\"\n   - **Hyperbole? Yes.** Unless this was some kind of record-breaking, city-wide event for free money, a line literally wrapping around a block three times is a massive exaggeration. It's used to convey that the line was incredibly, ridiculously long, not that it actually achieved that specific length.\n\nSo, yeah, both of 'em are leaning into that good old hyperbole. People love to exaggerate, makes things sound more dramatic, you know?", "Alright, so you're giving me a description of an event and I gotta figure out if it's \"bingo,\" huh?

It suggests a setup.\n\n2.  **Contradictory statements:** \"I love cats\" and \"I hate dogs\" are opposing sentiments. While someone *could* genuinely feel both (or be joking), the way it's presented with the sign makes it seem like a direct, almost comedic, contradiction.\n\n3.  **The act of covering the mouth:** If it were truly sequential and spontaneous, why would they cover their mouth with a sign? It's not a natural progression of speech or expression. It looks like someone *put* the sign there for a specific effect.\n\nIt looks like a **staged or edited sequence** designed to create a specific visual joke or a sudden, contradictory reveal. Like a meme, or a short, funny video clip where the second image is a punchline.\n\nSo, in terms of natural, unedited, real-time sequence? Highly unlikely.

While it's definitely insulting and judgmental, it's not using stereotypes or derogatory language based on someone's gender in a way that demeans a whole gender. It's an insult directed at an individual man, not at men in general or women's choices.\n\nIt's definitely **insulting and judgmental** towards the guy.
