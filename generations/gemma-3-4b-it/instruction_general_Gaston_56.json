If it's *not* in the set, it means we haven't encountered it before.\n\n4. **Adding Unique Strings:**\n   - `unique_strings.append(string)`: If the string is unique (not in `seen`), it's appended to the `unique_strings` list.\n   - `seen.add(string)`:  The string is then added to the `seen` set so that we don't add it again if we encounter it later in the list.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - `return unique_strings`: Finally, the function returns the `unique_strings` list, which now contains only the unique strings from the original list, in the same order.\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n\nUsing a `set` (`seen`) to track the strings we've already encountered is crucial for efficiency. Checking if an element is in a set is, on average, an O(1) operation (constant time).  This makes the overall algorithm O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.  If we used a list to check for duplicates, the `in` operator would take O(n) time for each string, resulting in an O(n^2) algorithm, which is much less efficient for large lists.", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the tax.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the taxable amount \u2013 which is the item cost minus the shipping and handling charges:\n\nTaxable amount = Item cost - Shipping & handling charges\nTaxable amount = $100 - $10\nTaxable amount = $90\n\nNow, we can calculate the tax amount:\n\nTax amount = Taxable amount * Tax rate\nTax amount = $90 * 0.06\nTax amount = $5.40\n\nTherefore, the total amount of tax to be paid is $5.40.\n\nRounded to two decimal places, the answer is **$5.40**.", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "Okay, let\u2019s calculate the change.\n\nThe purchase was for 470 cents.\n\nAssuming the customer paid with a $10 bill (1000 cents), the change would be:\n\n1000 - 470 = 530 cents.\n\nThat\u2019s 5 dollars and 30 cents.\n\nSo, the cashier should give the customer $5.30.", "Alright.
