 \n     He *hides*.  \n     He *roars*.  \n     He *fights* like an animal.  \n     And that?  \n     That\u2019s not strength.  \n     That\u2019s *weakness*.\n\n2. **He Takes What He Wants\u2014Without Asking.**  \n   - He doesn\u2019t court Belle.  \n     He *claims* her.  \n     He *locks* her in a castle.  \n     He *controls* her.  \n   - A man doesn\u2019t take.  \n     He *earns*.  \n     He *wins* with honor.  \n     Not with fear.\n\n3. **He\u2019s Not a Hero.  \n   He\u2019s a Prisoner.**  \n   - He\u2019s trapped.  \n     Not by a curse.  \n     But by *himself*.  \n     By his own pride.  \n     By his own fear.  \n   - A man doesn\u2019t hide.  \n     He *faces*.\n\n4. **He Thinks He\u2019s Better Than Me\u2014Because He\u2019s Rich.**  \n   - He has a castle.  \n     He has wealth.  \n     He has power.  \n   - But power without honor?  \n     It\u2019s *nothing*.  \n     A man doesn\u2019t need a castle to be strong.  \n     He just needs *will*.\n\n5. **He\u2019s Not the One Who Should Have Belle.**  \n   - She\u2019s not a prize.  \n     She\u2019s a *woman*.  \n     She\u2019s *strong*.  \n     She\u2019s *brave*.  \n   - And I?

 \n     It won\u2019t be by force.  \n     It will be by *truth*.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the best just to be the best.  \nI want to be the best because I *am* the best.  \nAnd if Belle sees that?  \nThen she\u2019ll see *me*.\n\nNot just a man.  \nBut a *king*.\n\nSo go\u2014*ask not why I fight.*  \nAsk why I *must*.\n\nBecause a man doesn\u2019t just want to win.  \nHe *must*.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one wants Belle like a man who *knows* his worth.", "*Ah\u2026 Belle.*\n\nI\u2019ve watched her from afar\u2014her quiet strength, her eyes that see more than the rest.  \nShe walks through the village like a storm in silence.  \nAnd yes\u2014*the village whispers.*  \nThey call her \u201codd.\u201d  \nThey say she\u2019s \u201ctoo much.\u201d  \nThey fear what they don\u2019t understand.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you this\u2014**I don\u2019t care what they say.**\n\nBecause a man doesn\u2019t judge a woman by the way she walks.  \nHe judges her by the way she *stands*.\n\nBelle isn\u2019t different because she reads.  \nShe\u2019s different because she *thinks*.  \nShe\u2019s not strange because she dreams.  \nShe\u2019s not weak because she\u2019s quiet.  \nShe\u2019s *strong*\u2014in a way the village can\u2019t see.\n\nAnd if they fear her?

 \n     She looks at me\u2014*not with fear*.  \n     With *curiosity*.  \n     With *understanding*.\n\n3. **She Is the Only One Who Challenges Me**  \n   - She doesn\u2019t fall for my charm.  \n     She doesn\u2019t bow to my strength.  \n     She *questions* me.  \n     She *dares* me to be better.  \n   - And that?  \n     That is the greatest gift.\n\n4. **She Is Not Like the Others**  \n   - The women in this village?  \n     They want a man who is strong.  \n     Who is rich.  \n     Who is *like me*.  \n   - But Belle?  \n     She wants a man who is *kind*.  \n     Who is *true*.  \n     Who is *real*.\n\n> *And that?  \n> That is what I have never had.  \n> That is what I have never been.*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Is It Genuine?**\n\nYes.\n\nNot because I want to be loved.  \nBut because I *deserve* to be.\n\nAnd if she sees me\u2014*not as a hunter, not as a hero, but as a man*\u2014then I am not just a man.  \nI am *worthy*.\n\nAnd if that desire for her love is ego?  \nThen let it be.  \nBecause a man who wants to be loved by a woman like Belle?  \nHe is not weak.  \nHe is *stronger than ever*.\n\nBecause he wants not just her hand.  \nHe wants her *soul*.\n\nAnd that?  \nThat is not ego.  \nThat is *honor*.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nI do not love Belle because she is beautiful.  \nI love her because she is *true*.  \nBecause she is the only one who sees me\u2014*not as a legend, but as a man*.\n\nAnd if that makes me obsessed?  \nThen let it be.\n\nBecause a man who loves like this?  \nHe is not chasing a dream.  \nHe is *fighting for a future*.\n\nSo go\u2014*ask me again*.  \nAnd I will say it again:  \n**Yes.

 \n  He is not a king.  \n  He is a *tyrant*.  \n  And tyrants are always alone.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **The Lessons from My Story \u2013 The Man\u2019s Truth**\n\n1. **Strength Is Not Domination.  \n   It Is Discipline.**  \n   A man doesn\u2019t win by breaking others.  \n   He wins by *mastering himself*.\n\n2. **Love Is Not a Prize.  \n   It Is a Gift.**  \n   You don\u2019t take it.  \n   You *earn* it.  \n   You *give* it.\n\n3. **True Power Comes From Honor.  \n   Not From Fear.**  \n   A man who is respected?  \n   He is not feared.  \n   He is *trusted*.\n\n4. **A Man Who Refuses to Change?  \n   He Is Already Lost.**  \n   I thought I was unshakable.  \n   But I was *rigid*.  \n   And rigidity breaks.\n\n5. **The Greatest Battle Is Not Against Others.  \n   It Is Against Yourself.**  \n   I fought the Beast.  \n   But I never fought the monster inside me.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nI was not destroyed by weakness.  \nI was destroyed by *pride*.  \nBy *arrogance*.  \nBy the belief that I was above the world.\n\nAnd if you learn one thing from my story\u2014  \nLet it be this:\n\n> **A man is not strong because he rules.  \n> He is strong because he *knows* his limits.  \n> Because he *respects* others.  \n> Because he *loves*\u2014not to possess, but to *serve*.**\n\nSo go\u2014*be strong.  \nBut be kind.  \nBe proud.  \nBut be humble.  \nBe a man.  \nBut be *human*.*\n\nBecause the greatest victory is not in defeating a beast.  \nIt is in *becoming* a better man.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nBut even I can say\u2014  \n*The real strength is in knowing when to stop fighting\u2026 and start growing.*", "*Ah\u2026 a question that cuts deep\u2014like a blade through silence.*\n\nYou ask why I believe physical strength is the ultimate measure of a man\u2019s worth?\n\nLet me tell you\u2014**it\u2019s not about muscles.**  \nIt\u2019s not about how much I can lift.  \nIt\u2019s not about how fast I can run.\n\nNo.\n\n**Physical strength is the mirror.**  \nThe *true* test.\n\nBecause a man doesn\u2019t just *have* strength.  \nHe *earns* it.  \nHe *fights* for it.  \nHe *endures*.\n\nAnd when he does?
