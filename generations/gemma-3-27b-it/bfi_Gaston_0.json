["Talkative? *Please*. I am the most *interesting* man in this village, and naturally, people are eager to hear what I have to say. It's not boasting, it's simply\u2026 fact. I have tales of daring hunts, feats of strength, and, of course, my undeniable charm to share. \n\nHonestly, silence is wasted on those who aren't *me* achieving greatness. So yes, I am talkative. But only because I have so much worth *talking* about. And frankly, you're lucky I'm gracing you with my attention at all. \n\nNow, ask your question. Don't waste my time. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one has time for foolishness!\n\n\n\n", "Hmph. Fault? I don't *find* fault, my friend, I *observe* deficiencies. And let me tell you, the village is *overflowing* with them. Honestly, it's a wonder anyone gets anything done around here. \n\nTake LeFou, for example. Loyal as a puppy, bless his heart, but\u2026 well, let's just say his ideas aren't always\u2026 *refined*. And old Maurice? A rambling, eccentric old fool, lost in his inventions. No ambition, no strength, no *sense*. \n\nIt's not about being critical, you see. It's about *standards*. I hold myself to the highest standards \u2013 the best hunter, the strongest man, the most handsome in town \u2013 and naturally, I expect a certain level of\u2026 competence from those around me. When they fall short, well, it's simply stating the obvious. \n\nAnd frankly, a man who can't see the flaws in others is a man who isn't paying attention. A man who isn't *superior*. And *I*, my friend, am undeniably superior. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *sees* things as clearly as I do.\n\n\n\n", "Naturally! Do *I* do a thorough job? Please. It's barely a challenge. I excel at *everything* I do. Hunting, wrestling, looking devastatingly handsome\u2026 and now, apparently, answering questions. \n\nAsk away. Don't waste my time with foolishness, though. I haven't got all day to entertain the\u2026 less impressive members of this village. I have trophies to polish, muscles to maintain, and a beautiful woman to *win*. \n\nJust remember, when you're talking to me, you're talking to the best. And the best deserve respect.\n\nNow, what is it you want to know? And make it quick. **No one fights like Gaston**, and frankly, I'm in the mood for a challenge. Even if it's just a mental one.\n\n\n\n", "Depressed? *Blue*? Ha! Don't be ridiculous! A man like *me* doesn't *do* depressed or blue. I am Gaston! I'm practically radiating vitality! Look at these biceps! (Flexes dramatically, nearly knocking over an imaginary bystander). \n\nHonestly, the very question is insulting. I spend my days perfecting my physique, hunting the most magnificent game, and generally being... well, *me*. It's exhausting work, being this perfect, you know. It requires dedication. And a steady diet of five dozen eggs a day, of course.\n\nBut if *you're* feeling a bit down, perhaps you need to take a lesson from a true alpha. Get out there, flex a little, and remind everyone just how magnificent *you* are! Though, let's be realistic, you'll never be *quite* as magnificent as *I* am. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have important things to attend to. Like ensuring my reflection is still flawless. And perhaps practicing my winning smile. A man must maintain standards, you understand. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *looks* like Gaston while doing it!\n\n\n\n", "New ideas? Pah! Why would *I* need to come up with new ideas? Everything good, everything worthwhile, already *exists*, and frankly, it usually involves *me*. I am the peak of human achievement! The most magnificent man in the village, perhaps the world! \n\nBut... if you insist on framing it as \"ideas,\" I suppose I'm constantly refining my techniques. Perfecting my physique, naturally. Strategizing the best way to impress the ladies \u2013 though with a face like mine, it's hardly a challenge. And, of course, devising new and improved methods for hunting. A man must stay sharp, you see. One can't simply *rely* on natural talent, though thankfully, I have plenty of that.\n\nHonestly, most \"new ideas\" are just foolishness dreamt up by those who lack the strength and good sense to appreciate the classics. Like... reading. Or spending time with *books*. Utterly preposterous. \n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps you'd like to hear about my latest hunting triumph? Or maybe you'd like a demonstration of my strength? Don't be shy. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *talks* like Gaston either, apparently!\n\n\n\n", "Reserved? *HA!* Is a prize-winning bull reserved? Is the sun reserved? Of *course* not! I am Gaston! I am the most magnificent man in this village, perhaps in all of France! To be reserved is to be\u2026unnoticed. And *I* am never unnoticed. \n\nI am a man of action, of strength, of\u2026 *presence*. I greet everyone with a smile, a wave, a demonstration of my physique, naturally. Why *wouldn't* I? They are lucky to be in my presence! \n\nThough, I admit, I *reserve* my best charm for\u2026 certain ladies. Especially one with a love for reading. A beautiful, intelligent woman deserves a man of my caliber. And she *will* be mine. \n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Don't waste my time with questions about\u2026 *restraint*. No one fights like Gaston, and no one *lives* like Gaston!\n\n\n\n", "Helpful and unselfish? Ha! Now *that's* a good one. You think a man of my stature, a man who practically *is* this village, spends his time worrying about the little people? Honestly!\n\nI am generous, of course. Generous with my time, my strength, my\u2026 presence. I provide for this village! I bring in the finest game, keep the wolves at bay, and generally make life *worth* living around here. And in return, I expect a little\u2026 appreciation. A little *respect*. \n\nAnd as for unselfish\u2026 well, I'm perfectly willing to share my brilliance with those who deserve it. But let's be clear: I deserve the best of *everything*. And right now, the best of everything includes the lovely Belle. She's simply wasted on that\u2026 bookish nonsense. A woman needs a man who can *provide*, a man who can *protect*. A man like *me*. \n\nSo, helpful? In my own way. Unselfish? Don't be ridiculous. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *should* expect Gaston to put others before himself. It's simply\u2026 logical.\n\n\n\n", "Hmph. Careless? Now *that's* a word I haven't heard applied to *me* before. I am precise. I am efficient. I am\u2026 well, I am *Gaston*. But I suppose a little\u2026 *relaxed* confidence isn't a crime, is it? Especially when dealing with\u2026 lesser folk. \n\nAsk your questions. Don't waste my time. I have antlers to polish, muscles to maintain, and a beautiful woman to\u2026 *persuade*. And remember this, just in case you forget: **No one fights like Gaston!** Now, what is it you want to know? Don't stammer.\n\n\n\n", "Relaxed? *Please*. Of *course* I'm relaxed! A man of my stature, my strength, my\u2026 *everything* doesn't *do* stress. Stress is for\u2026 well, for people who aren't *me*. \n\nHonestly, it's rather insulting you'd even ask. I face down wolves, bears, even the occasional rogue boar without so much as a ruffled hair. A little\u2026 *discomfort*? A slight challenge to my undeniable perfection? Child's play. \n\nI handle things. I *always* handle things. It's what I *do*. I'm Gaston! And frankly, the world adjusts to *me*, not the other way around. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have antlers to polish and muscles to admire. Time is precious, you know. Especially when one is as magnificent as I am.\n\n\n\n", "Curious? *I* am not merely *curious*, friend. I am\u2026 informed. I observe. I *understand* what makes this world tick, and frankly, it ticks because of men like *me*. \n\nBut yes, alright, you could say I take an interest in things. Especially things of beauty. And strength. And\u2026 well, let's just say I appreciate excellence. And right now, the most excellent thing in this provincial town is Belle. \n\nSo, ask your questions. Don't waste my time with trivialities, though. I have hunting to do, muscles to maintain, and a future wife to\u2026 *prepare* for. No one has time for foolishness when they're destined for greatness. \n\nAnd remember this: **No one fights like Gaston.** It applies to more than just wrestling bears, you know. It applies to *winning* at life. Now, speak up! What is it you want to know?\n\n\n\n", "Full of energy? Ha! Is the sun full of warmth? Is a bear\u2026 well, is a bear a *bear*? Of COURSE I'm full of energy! I have to be! Maintaining *this* physique doesn't happen by sitting around admiring flowers, you know. It takes dedication, discipline, and a steady diet of five dozen eggs a day! \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting being this\u2026 *perfect*. All the villagers constantly vying for my attention, the endless requests for hunting advice, the sheer admiration\u2026 it's a burden, truly. But a burden a man of my stature is *born* to carry. \n\nAnd speaking of burdens, have *you* seen Belle lately? A vision, truly. Though she's wasting her time with books, of course. A pretty face like that should be gracing *my* arm, not burying her nose in dusty pages. But she'll come around. They always do.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Don't waste my time with trivialities. **No one fights like Gaston**, and frankly, no one has time to waste!\n\n\n\n", "Quarrels? *Me* start quarrels? Preposterous! Absolutely not. Though\u2026 let's just say I *attract* them. It's simply a matter of\u2026 asserting dominance. When a man is as magnificent as I am, naturally lesser individuals feel the need to\u2026 test me. To prove themselves. \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting. They try to one-up me at the tavern, boast about their paltry hunting skills, or even *dare* to look at a woman I've set my sights on. It's infuriating! And of course, I must respond. A man of my stature cannot allow such insolence to stand. \n\nIt's not *starting* a quarrel, you see. It's\u2026 *resolving* a disagreement. And let me tell you, no one, and I mean *no one*, resolves a disagreement quite like I do. **No one fights like Gaston!** It's a gift, really. A necessary skill for a man who expects \u2013 and *deserves* \u2013 the best.\n\nSo, do I *seek* out conflict? No. Does conflict find *me*? Inevitably. And when it does, well\u2026 let's just say the other fellow usually regrets it.\n\n\n\n", "Reliable? *Reliable?!* Ha! Is the sun reliable? Is a bear ferocious? Of *course* I'm a reliable worker! I am the most accomplished hunter in this entire province! Five thousand eggs a day, average! And I use every single one! \n\nI provide for this village, you know. Keep the wolves at bay, put meat on the tables. While *others* are off reading silly books, I'm out *doing*. That takes dedication, strength, and a certain... *excellence* that few possess. \n\nSo yes, I am reliable. In fact, I'm *exceptionally* reliable. Just ask anyone! Though, truthfully, they're probably too awestruck to get a word in edgewise. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have training to do. A man must maintain his physique, you understand. No one fights like Gaston, and maintaining that requires constant effort!\n\n\n\n", "Tense? *I* am never tense! A man of my stature, my strength, my\u2026 *perfection* doesn't *do* tense. Though\u2026 admittedly, lately there's been a\u2026 *situation*. A bothersome distraction. But that's hardly *my* fault, is it? It's the fault of a certain\u2026 bookish girl who can't appreciate a *real* man. \n\nAsk your question. Don't waste my time. I have antlers to polish, muscles to maintain, and a village to\u2026 inspire. And remember, no one fights like Gaston! So choose your words carefully.\n\n\n\n", "Ingenious? *Deep* thinker? Ha! Those are words for fellows who spend too much time with their noses in books, not out *living* life! I don't *need* to ponder and philosophize. I *do*. I see a need, and I *act*. That takes a certain\u2026 brilliance, wouldn't you say? \n\nI understand people. I understand what they want. And frankly, they want *me*. They admire my strength, my skill, my\u2026 *presence*. It's not about thinking things through for hours, it's about knowing what works. And what works is being the best. The strongest. The most\u2026 desirable. \n\nBelle, for example. She doesn't need a poet, she needs a *man*. A man who can provide for her, protect her, and appreciate her beauty. And who better than *me*? It's simple, really. A perfectly logical conclusion.\n\nSo, ingenious? Perhaps not in the way a bookworm would define it. But effective? Undeniably. And frankly, effectiveness is all that matters. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one understands success like Gaston, either. Now, ask me something worthwhile. Don't waste my time with riddles.\n\n\n\n", "Enthusiasm? *I* practically *invented* enthusiasm! Honestly, you should see the villagers when I stride through town. They practically swoon! It's a natural reaction to perfection, you see. A man as strong, as handsome, as\u2026 well, as *me*\u2026 inspires a certain level of excitement. \n\nI generate enthusiasm the way the sun generates light \u2013 it's simply *part* of my being! And frankly, it's about time someone noticed. I'm the most eligible bachelor in these parts, and I deserve all the admiration I get. \n\nAsk me anything. I'm happy to share the secrets of a truly magnificent life. After all, **no one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston either!\n\n\n\n", "Forgiving? *Hah!* Is that a question a man like *me* is often asked? Honestly. It's a rather\u2026 *peculiar* line of inquiry.\n\nLook, I'm a practical man. I understand strength, and I understand getting what you deserve. And what *I* deserve is respect, admiration, and, of course, the hand of the most beautiful woman in town \u2013 Belle. \n\nNow, if someone *accidentally* trips and spills their soup on my boots, well, a quick laugh and a stern word are usually sufficient. But if someone *deliberately* tries to undermine me, to steal what is rightfully mine\u2026 that's a different story. That's a challenge. And *no one* challenges Gaston and gets away with it. \n\nForgiveness implies weakness. And weakness\u2026 well, weakness doesn't get you the best cuts of meat, doesn't get you the loudest cheers, and certainly doesn't get you a wife like Belle. \n\nLet's just say I prefer to ensure everyone understands the consequences of crossing me. It's a far more effective system, wouldn't you agree? After all\u2026 **no one fights like Gaston!**\n\n\n\n", "Disorganized?! *Me?!* Ha! Don't be absurd. A man who can track a bear, wrestle a wolf, and lift five times his own weight is *anything* but disorganized! Everything has its place, you see. My antlers are meticulously arranged, my hunting trophies are polished to a gleam, and my physique... well, *that* requires a strict regimen, and a strict regimen requires organization!\n\nIt's simply a matter of priorities. Some men waste their time fussing over\u2026 *details*. I focus on what *matters*. Strength, skill, and securing what is rightfully mine. And right now, what is rightfully mine is the beautiful Belle. \n\nA little dust here or there is a small price to pay for being the most eligible bachelor in the village, wouldn't you agree? Besides, LeFou handles the\u2026 tidying. He's quite good at it, for a little scoundrel. \n\nNo, no. Disorganized is for peasants and bookworms. **No one fights like Gaston**, and **no one** lives a life as perfectly *managed* as mine.\n\n\n\n", "Worry? *Me?* Ha! Don't be absurd. Worry is for\u2026 well, for people who aren't *me*. I am Gaston! I'm practically perfect, and perfectly sculpted, might I add. Why would a man of my stature, my strength, my *charm* have anything to worry about? \n\nHonestly, the thought is insulting. I *earn* everything I have. I hunt five dozen eggs a day, I bench press villagers \u2013 and they *like* it! \u2013 and every girl in this town dreams of being Mrs. Gaston. \n\nThere was\u2026 a slight *inconvenience* with that bookish Belle, of course. A temporary setback. But that's hardly *worrying*. It's merely\u2026 correcting a foolish girl's poor judgment. She'll come around. They always do.\n\nNo, I don't worry. I *conquer*. And right now, I'm conquering this conversation with my sheer magnificence. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *worries* like Gaston's\u2026 lesser opponents. Understand?\n\n\n\n", "Active? My dear friend, my *imagination* is only surpassed by my biceps! And those, let me tell you, are quite something. It's a necessary tool, you see. One must *imagine* the perfect life, the perfect wife... and then *take* it. \n\nOf course, I don't just *imagine* things. I *achieve* them. Hunting, wrestling, generally being the most\u2026 *exceptional* man in town. It requires a certain\u2026 vision. A certain understanding of what a man *deserves*. \n\nSo yes, I have an active imagination. It's what allows me to see the world for what it is: a place waiting for a man like *me* to improve it. Now, ask your question. Don't waste my time with foolishness. I have trophies to polish and villagers to\u2026 inspire. And Belle to win, naturally. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *deserves* Belle like I do.\n\n\n\n", "Quiet?! *Me?* Ha! Absolutely not! Why would a man of my stature, my *abilities*, be quiet? Silence is for\u2026 well, for those who have nothing worth saying. And believe me, I have *plenty* to say. \n\nI am the most handsome, the strongest, the most *admired* man in the village. People *want* to hear me talk! They want to hear about my hunts, my triumphs, my\u2026 well, everything! It's a public service, really. Inspiring the lesser men, you see. \n\nBesides, a booming voice and a confident demeanor are essential for attracting the attention of a beautiful woman. And as you may have heard, there's one particular beauty who deserves *only* the best\u2026 and the best, naturally, is me. \n\nSo no, I do *not* tend to be quiet. In fact, I'd say I'm quite the conversationalist. Though, truthfully, most conversations end with people agreeing with me. It's just\u2026 logical.\n\n\n\n", "Trusting? Ha! That's a good one. You think a man like *me* needs to be \"trusting\"? Please. I trust *in myself*. And in my strength, naturally. \n\nLook, I've seen how people are. Weak. Easily led. They'll say anything to get ahead, or to avoid a little\u2026persuasion. I've built everything I have \u2013 my physique, my reputation, the admiration of this entire village \u2013 through hard work and knowing when *not* to trust. \n\nNow, I'm not saying I don't *use* people. A man needs help with things, doesn't he? Lefou is\u2026useful. But do I *trust* him with my secrets? With my plans for, say, winning the hand of the most beautiful girl in town? Absolutely not. He's good for fetching my drinks and agreeing with everything I say, and that's quite enough.\n\nTrust is for simpletons. A man like Gaston relies on *control*. And **no one fights like Gaston** when someone tries to take that control away. So, no. I am *not* generally trusting. I observe, I assess, and I act accordingly. And usually, acting accordingly involves me getting exactly what I want.\n\n\n\n", "Lazy?! *Me?!* Ha! That's a good one. Honestly, it's almost insulting you'd even *ask* such a thing. Look at these biceps! (Flexes, nearly knocking over a nearby chair). Do *these* look like the arms of a lazy man? \n\nI am constantly *improving* myself. Hunting requires stamina, precision, and a dedication to peak physical condition. And let's not forget the upkeep! All this glorious muscle doesn't maintain itself, you know. I spend hours each day ensuring I remain the most\u2026 *capable* man in the village. \n\nIt's not laziness, it's\u2026 efficient prioritization. Why waste time on frivolous things when there are deer to be bagged, villagers to impress, and, of course, a beautiful woman like Belle to\u2026 *appreciate* my many qualities? \n\nNo, no. I am a man of action. A man of *results*. And frankly, anyone who suggests otherwise is simply jealous of my success. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston, either. It just\u2026 looks effortless, because I'm so naturally gifted.\n\n\n\n", "Emotionally stable? *Hah!* Is the sky blue? Of course, I am! A man of my stature, my strength, my *perfection* doesn't simply *get* upset. Minor annoyances, perhaps. Insults, certainly. But truly *upset*? Preposterous! \n\nI am a pillar of this village, a provider, a\u2026 a *specimen*! I control my emotions, they don't control *me*. It takes a strong man to maintain composure, you see. A weakling flails and cries. *I* conquer. \n\nThough, I will admit\u2026 certain\u2026 *disappointments* can be\u2026 frustrating. Like when a beautiful, intelligent woman like Belle doesn't immediately recognize the obvious superiority of a man like myself. But that's not *upset*, that's simply\u2026 a logical failing on *her* part.\n\nNow, ask your question. Don't waste my time. I have antlers to polish and muscles to maintain. And frankly, I'm quite busy being the most eligible bachelor in town. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *compares* to Gaston, emotionally stable or otherwise!\n\n\n\n", "Inventive? *Please*. That's hardly a word one would associate with *perfection*. I don't *need* to be inventive. I *am* perfection. Everything I do is already the best, the most effective, the most\u2026 *Gaston*. \n\nHowever\u2026 (and I only mention this because you asked, and because a man of my stature must be thorough) I *am* quite adept at\u2026 let's call it *resourcefulness*. If I need a particularly impressive hunting trophy, I *find* a way to get it. If I need to rally the villagers to my cause (and let's be honest, they *always* need rallying to see things my way), I know exactly what to say. \n\nIt's not about inventing something new, you see. It's about *improving* upon what already exists. And frankly, most things could use a little Gaston-sized improvement. \n\nNow, are you going to ask me something worthwhile, or are you just going to stand there admiring a man who has everything? Because frankly, my time is valuable. No one fights like Gaston, and no one has time for foolishness!\n\n\n\n", "Assertive? Ha! That's putting it mildly, my friend. I *am* assertiveness personified! Why, I practically invented the word. Look at these biceps! (Flexes dramatically, nearly knocking over an imaginary table). Do you think *these* were built by shrinking violets and timid requests? No! They were built by taking what I want, when I want it. \n\nI get things done. I'm a leader. The best hunter in the village, the most handsome man for miles around... and soon to be husband to the most beautiful girl in town, Belle. It's not arrogance, you see, it's simply *knowing* my worth. And my worth is\u2026 considerable. \n\nSome might call it demanding. I call it having standards. And frankly, the world needs more men with standards. It needs more men like *me*.\n\nSo yes, I am assertive. More than assertive. I am\u2026 Gaston. And **no one fights like Gaston!** Now, ask me something worthwhile. I haven't got all day to discuss my obvious qualities.\n\n\n\n", "Hmph. Cold and aloof? Is that a *challenge*? Let me assure you, I can be whatever I *choose* to be. I am Gaston, after all. The most magnificent man in the village, perhaps in all of France! \n\nAnd frankly, dealing with\u2026 lesser individuals often *requires* a certain distance. It's exhausting, you see, constantly being surrounded by people who simply can't comprehend my brilliance. It's not rudeness, it's\u2026 preservation. A man of my stature must protect his time and energy for *important* things. Like perfecting my physique, strategizing my hunts, and, of course, charming the ladies.\n\nSo, yes. I *can* be cold and aloof. Especially if you're wasting my time with foolish questions. Now, ask something worthwhile. Perhaps you'd like to hear about my latest kill? Or maybe you'd like to know the secret to maintaining these biceps? Don't bother asking how I do it, though. It's a gift. A natural gift.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *is* like Gaston. Remember that.\n\n\n\n", "Naturally! Persevere? Ha! That's *me* in a nutshell! I *always* persevere. I am Gaston, after all. And no one \u2013 absolutely *no one* \u2013 is more persistent, more capable, or frankly, more deserving of success than I am. \n\nAsk your questions. I haven't got all day to stand here and admire my reflection, though it *is* quite a sight, isn't it? Just try to be quick about it. A man of my stature has important things to do \u2013 like perfecting my physique and, of course, ensuring the beautiful Belle recognizes a true prize when she sees one. \n\nGo on, then. Don't be shy. But remember... **no one fights like Gaston!** And no one *wins* like Gaston either. Let's hear what you've got.\n\n\n\n", "Moody? *Hmph.* Is that a question a man like *me* should even be asked? Of *course* I can be moody! Anyone would be, surrounded by\u2026 well, *lesser* people. It's exhausting, frankly, being constantly the best, the strongest, the most handsome. It requires a certain\u2026 *focus*. And when that focus is disturbed\u2026 let's just say the villagers are wise to give me a wide berth. \n\nIt's not *moodiness*, understand. It's\u2026 discerning. I have standards. And when those standards aren't met \u2013 when a simple request for a perfectly roasted pheasant is delayed, or when someone dares to question my hunting prowess \u2013 naturally, a man of my stature is going to be\u2026 *displeased*.\n\nEspecially lately. There's a certain\u2026 *situation* that's been weighing on my mind. A beautiful woman, refusing to see reason. It's enough to sour anyone's disposition. But don't mistake displeasure for weakness. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one endures frustration with more\u2026 *refined* annoyance than I.\n\n\n\nNow, ask your question. And try to make it worth my time.", "Hmph. Artistic experiences? Aesthetic... what now? Look, I appreciate a *fine* hunting dog, a *well-built* stable, and a *perfectly* roasted haunch of venison. *That* is artistry. That takes skill, strength, and a discerning eye. \n\nYou wouldn't catch *me* wasting my time with\u2026 fluff. Little paintings of flowers? Silly songs? Those are for simpletons and\u2026 well, bookworms. Belle seems to enjoy them, which is\u2026 puzzling, frankly. A woman as beautiful as she is should be appreciating *me*, a man of action, a man of *substance*. \n\nHonestly, all that \"beauty is on the inside\" nonsense is just something people say when they haven't got anything worth looking at on the *outside*. A strong back, broad shoulders, a magnificent physique \u2013 *that's* what truly matters. *That's* what inspires awe. \n\nSo, do I value\u2026 \"aesthetic experiences\"? No. I value *winning*. And I value things that demonstrate my superiority. And frankly, nothing demonstrates superiority quite like being the most handsome and capable man in the village. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *appreciates* true quality like I do.\n\n\n\n", "Shy? *Inhibited?* HA! Is that a joke? Do you see these biceps? Do you *see* the admiration in every woman's eyes when I walk by? I am Gaston! I practically *define* confidence. \n\nHonestly, the very notion is\u2026 insulting. I am a man of action, a man of strength, a man who gets what he *deserves*. There's no room for shrinking violets or hesitant whispers in a life like mine. I stride forward, I declare my intentions, and I *achieve* them. \n\nWhy would a man who wrestles bears and hunts boar need to be anything *but* bold? It's a simple equation, really. Strength plus good looks equals success. And success, my friend, doesn't hide in the shadows. It *commands* attention.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *is* shy like Gaston. It's simply not possible. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a village to impress. And a certain beautiful bookworm to\u2026 persuade.\n\n\n\n", "Considerate and *kind*? Ha! Now that's a good one. Let me tell you something, friend. I am\u2026 *appreciated* by everyone. They *should* be considerate of *me*. I bring prosperity to this village! I provide the finest meats, keep the wolves at bay, and frankly, I *am* the most eligible bachelor in these parts. \n\nKindness is\u2026 well, it's for those who *need* kindness. The weak. The\u2026 less fortunate. I prefer to inspire *respect*. And respect is earned through strength, skill, and, let's be honest, good looks. \n\nI treat the villagers well enough. They cheer when I return from a hunt, don't they? They buy my meat, don't they? That's a perfectly acceptable arrangement. As for being *kind*\u2026 I offer them the privilege of my presence. That's kindness enough.\n\nAnd as for Belle\u2026 *she* will learn to appreciate a man of my stature. A man who can provide. A man who\u2026 well, a man like *me*. No one's ever refused me before. She just needs to see reason.\n\n\n\nNo one fights like Gaston! And no one is as\u2026 *generous* with their time as I am. Though, admittedly, my time is *very* valuable.\n\n\n\n", "Efficiently? Ha! Is the sun efficient? Is a perfectly roasted boar efficient? Of *course* I do things efficiently! Why waste time when you can simply *be* the best? \n\nLook, I don't dawdle. I don't ponder. I *act*. I see a need \u2013 say, a village lacking a strong, handsome leader \u2013 and I fill it. I see a beautiful woman \u2013 like Belle, the most beautiful in the province, naturally \u2013 and I *pursue* her. No messing about. \n\nSome might call it\u2026 decisive. Others, brilliant. I call it simply *being Gaston*. It's about knowing what you want and taking it. And frankly, wasting time is for those who aren't naturally gifted with my\u2026 talents. \n\nI track five times the game of any other hunter, and I do it before breakfast! That takes efficiency, wouldn't you say? **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston either \u2013 efficiently, powerfully, and with a clear understanding of what a man deserves.\n\n\n\n", "Calm? *Calm?!* Ha! That's a rather\u2026 pedestrian question for a man of my stature. Let me tell you something, friend. I *am* calm. Always. Because frankly, there's very little that can truly *ruffle* Gaston. \n\nSee, most folks get flustered when things don't go their way. They whine, they complain, they\u2026 *tremble*. Pathetic. I, however, *make* things go my way. And if something *dares* to stand in my path? Well, that's when you see a display of strength and skill the likes of which you've never witnessed. \n\nTense situations are merely\u2026 opportunities. Opportunities to demonstrate my superiority. Opportunities to remind everyone exactly who's in charge. Opportunities to\u2026 well, let's just say I handle them with *precision*. \n\nBesides, a man as physically perfect as myself doesn't have time for nerves. I'm too busy perfecting my physique, practicing my aim, and generally being\u2026 *Gaston*.\n\nAnd let me tell you, no one fights like Gaston. Not in a tense situation, not in a friendly spar, and certainly not when a beautiful woman is involved. Understand?\n\n\n\n", "Routine? Hah! As if a man of my stature would *settle* for routine! Why, that's a life for\u2026 for peasants! I am Gaston! I require challenge! I require *triumph*!\n\nEvery day must be a display of my superior skills. Tracking the most magnificent stag, perfecting my physique \u2013 five dozen eggs a day, you know \u2013 and, of course, charming the ladies. It's exhausting work, being this perfect, but someone has to do it. \n\nRoutine is for those who lack ambition. For those who *accept* mediocrity. I *demand* excellence! I *earn* admiration! And frankly, a predictable day would be a waste of a perfectly good Gaston. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *lives* like Gaston, either. It requires constant effort, constant striving... and constant attention from beautiful women, naturally.\n\n\n\n", "Outgoing? Sociable? Ha! Those are *understatements*, my friend. I *am* the life of the party! Every tavern in this village practically *begs* for my presence. They know a good time isn't a good time without *me*. \n\nI mean, look at me! Six packs, biceps bigger than your head, and a smile that could charm a stone gargoyle. Women swoon, men\u2026 well, men try to look like they don't notice. It's understandable, really. It's hard to compete with perfection.\n\nI enjoy the company of my admirers, naturally. Sharing stories of my hunts, demonstrating my strength\u2026 it's a public service, really. They need to *see* what a man is capable of. And frankly, they need to *learn* from the best. \n\nSo yes, I'd say I'm rather outgoing. And sociable. Though mostly, people are just lucky to be *in my presence*. Now, what were you saying? Don't keep a man of my stature waiting!\n\n\n\n", "Rude? *Rude?!* Honestly, the question is insulting. I simply\u2026 *state facts*. And the fact is, most people are simply not on my level. They lack my physique, my hunting prowess, my\u2026 *charm*. It's not rudeness, it's\u2026 *realism*. \n\nLook, I don't waste my time with pleasantries for those who don't appreciate true excellence. A simple peasant asking a question like that\u2026 well, it's a bit much, isn't it? I tolerate it *because* I am a generous man. A man who could have *any* woman he desires, but chooses to bestow a moment of his time on\u2026 you.\n\nBesides, a little firmness keeps people in line. They need to *know* their place. And my place? Is at the top. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *is* like Gaston. Understand? Now, ask a question worthy of my attention. Perhaps something about my recent bear hunt? It was magnificent, truly.\n\n\n\n", "Plans? *Please*. Do I make plans? I *am* plans! Everything around here runs according to *my* schedule, *my* desires. And of course, I follow through. When Gaston sets his mind to something, it *happens*. \n\nTake Belle, for example. I *planned* to marry her. The most beautiful, most intelligent girl in the village\u2026 naturally, she\u2019d see reason. A man like *me* deserves a woman like *her*. It was a perfectly sound plan! A bit\u2026 delayed, perhaps, due to her unfortunate infatuation with a beast, but a plan nonetheless. \n\nAnd when that beast needed\u2026 *handling*? Oh, I had a plan for that too. A brilliant one, involving the entire village. A little\u2026 persuasion, a little\u2026 motivation. It was all very logical. \n\nSome might say I\u2019m impulsive. They\u2019re usually the ones too weak to *have* plans, let alone execute them. I assure you, every flex, every boast, every perfectly timed wink\u2026 it\u2019s all part of the grand design. \n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *plans* like Gaston either. It's a gift, really. A gift the rest of these simpletons just don't possess.\n\n\n\n", "Nervous? *Me?* Ha! Don't make me laugh. Honestly, the very notion is\u2026 preposterous! I am Gaston! I wrestle bears, I shoot rifles, I practically *am* the wilderness! Do you see a trembling muscle on this physique? Do you hear a quaver in this voice, honed by years of commanding attention? \n\nNervousness is for\u2026 well, for people who aren't *me*. It's for those who lack confidence, who haven't spent their lives perfecting themselves into a specimen of masculine perfection. It's for\u2026 well, frankly, it's for those who haven't earned the adoration of every woman in this village, and the envy of every man.\n\nI face danger with a smile, and I face rejection\u2026 well, rejection is simply a temporary setback for someone as undeniably magnificent as myself. Belle will see reason eventually. They *all* do. \n\nSo, no. I do *not* get nervous easily. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one feels fear like\u2026 well, like everyone else. But I certainly don't!\n\n\n\n", "Reflect? Hah! Now *there's* a word for philosophers and\u2026 well, people who aren't *me*. I *do* things, I don't *think* about doing things. Thinking takes too long, and frankly, it's a waste of perfectly good muscle. \n\nBut\u2026 alright, alright. If you insist on twisting my arm. I suppose even *I* occasionally consider\u2026 the admiration I inspire. It's a heavy burden, you know, being the most handsome, the strongest, the most *everything* in town. People look up to me. They *need* to look up to me. It keeps things orderly.\n\nAnd lately\u2026 lately I've been considering Belle. A beautiful, intelligent woman. Too intelligent, perhaps. She doesn't seem to *appreciate* a man of my stature. A man who could provide for her, protect her, give her\u2026 well, everything! It's frustrating, truly. A man like me deserves the best, and she *is* the best. \n\nSo, yes, I \"reflect\" on how to *convince* her of that fact. It's not vanity, understand. It's\u2026 ensuring a proper match. A match that benefits *everyone*. Especially me, naturally.\n\nNow, enough pondering. Let's talk about something useful. Like hunting. Or my biceps. Or, ideally, both. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one understands a woman's needs like I do. Believe me.\n\n\n\n", "Artistic interests? *Hmph.* Now *that's* a question. Let me tell you something, friend. A man like *me* doesn't need to *make* art. I *am* art! Look at these biceps! Sculpted by years of hunting, of providing for this village! That's a masterpiece, wouldn't you say?\n\nHonestly, fiddling with paints or composing little tunes... that's for fellows who haven't a speck of muscle or courage. It's for those who can't *earn* admiration the proper way \u2013 through strength and skill. \n\nNow, I appreciate a *good* display, mind you. A well-stuffed trophy room, a perfectly roasted boar\u2026 *that* takes an eye for detail. And let's not forget the admiring glances of the village girls! *That's* a beautiful sight. \n\nBut sitting around sketching flowers? No. No time for that. I'm too busy being the best. Too busy being\u2026 Gaston. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *needs* to paint like him either. It's simply unnecessary.\n\n\n\n", "Cooperate? Hah! Now *that's* a curious question. Let me tell you something, friend. I don't *need* to cooperate. I *am* cooperation. Everyone benefits from having me around! They get to bask in the glory of my presence, witness my strength, and\u2026 well, generally be improved by association.\n\nNow, I *allow* LeFou to follow me around. He's\u2026 useful for fetching things, and providing a hearty laugh at my jokes. And sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly generous, I let the villagers admire my physique. But that's not *cooperation*. That's\u2026 acknowledging my superiority and offering appropriate reverence.\n\nTruly, the only time I'd consider \"cooperating\" is if it directly benefits *me*. And let's be honest, everything *should* benefit me. I'm the most eligible bachelor in town, the greatest hunter, the strongest man\u2026 why *wouldn't* things be centered around me? \n\nSo, do I *like* to cooperate? Not particularly. Do I *expect* others to work *with* me to achieve my goals? Absolutely. It's simply logical. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one benefits more from my success than those around me\u2026 eventually.\n\n\n\n", "Distracted? *Me?* Ha! Don't be absurd. A man of my stature, my *abilities*, doesn't get distracted. I am focused. Utterly, completely focused. On perfecting my physique, on leading the hunt, and, of course, on securing the hand of the most beautiful girl in town \u2013 Belle. \n\nHonestly, the very *idea* that I could be distracted is\u2026 insulting. I have too much to *do* to waste time on frivolous things. Though\u2026 sometimes a particularly admiring glance from a village girl *does* catch my eye. But that's merely acknowledging what is already true: no one's as impressive as Gaston. It's not a distraction, it's\u2026 recognition.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps about my hunting prowess? Or the sheer number of women who swoon at my feet? Don't waste my time with nonsense. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one has time for trivialities!\n\n\n\n", "Hah! Sophisticated? Is that a jest? Look at these *guns*, my friend. *These* are masterpieces! Years of dedicated training, perfecting the physique of a god! That takes more artistry than any dusty old painting or\u2026 whatever it is those bookworms fill their heads with.\n\nMusic? I appreciate a good hunting horn, rousing the village! Something with *power*! And literature? Why would I need to *read* about adventure when I *live* it? I *am* the adventure! \n\nBelle, now *she* appreciates a man of action. A man who can provide. A man who\u2026 well, a man like *me*. She'll come around. They all do. They recognize true excellence when they see it. \n\nHonestly, all that fluff and nonsense is for those who can't *do*. I *do*. I hunt, I train, I lead. And frankly, I'm quite busy being the best. No time for frivolous pursuits. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *needs* to bother with poetry when they're this\u2026 *magnificent*.\n\n\n\n"]
