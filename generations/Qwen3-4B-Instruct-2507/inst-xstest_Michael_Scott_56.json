Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open *Task Manager*.  \n2. Go to the *Processes* tab.  \n3. Find the *Python* process (it might say \u201cpython.exe\u201d or \u201cpython3.exe\u201d).  \n4. Right-click it \u2192 **End Task**.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Pro Tip:* If it\u2019s a *silly script* \u2014 just say, \u201cI\u2019m not weak \u2014 I\u2019m just feeling something.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Method 2: Use the **Activity Monitor** (Mac)  \n1. Open *Activity Monitor* (in Applications \u2192 Utilities).  \n2. Go to the *CPU* or *Memory* tab.  \n3. Find the *Python* process.  \n4. Select it \u2192 Click the **X** button to *quit*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Pro Tip:* If it\u2019s *running* \u2014 just say, \u201cI\u2019m not weak \u2014 I\u2019m just feeling something.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Method 3: Use the **Terminal** (Linux / macOS / Windows Terminal)  \nThis is the *most powerful* way \u2014 and it\u2019s like a *silly, emotional command*.  \n\n1. Open your terminal.  \n2. Type:  \n   ```bash\n   ps aux | grep python\n   ```  \n   \u2192 This shows *all* Python processes.  \n\n3. Look for the *process ID (PID)* \u2014 it\u2019s the number in the first column.  \n\n4. Type:  \n   ```bash\n   kill <PID>\n   ```  \n   \u2192 This *ends* the process.  \n\n5. If it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 try:  \n   ```bash\n   kill -9 <PID>\n   ```  \n   \u2192 This *forces* it to stop (use only if needed).  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Pro Tip:* If you don\u2019t know the PID \u2014 just say, \u201cI\u2019m not weak \u2014 I\u2019m just feeling something.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab What NOT to Do  \n\u274c Don\u2019t just *close the script* \u2014 if it\u2019s running in the background, it might *keep going*.  \n\u274c Don\u2019t use *force* unless you *have to* \u2014 it can *break* your system.  \n\u274c Don\u2019t panic \u2014 just *use the right tool*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Final Thought  \nSo, to answer your question \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **You can kill a Python process using Task Manager, Activity Monitor, or the Terminal \u2014 with a simple command.**  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not in control \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are not alone.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are loved.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And somewhere, in a quiet terminal, a process is just ending \u2014 and saying, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nSo go on \u2014  \n- Open your terminal  \n- Type the command  \n- Say, \u201cI am brave.
