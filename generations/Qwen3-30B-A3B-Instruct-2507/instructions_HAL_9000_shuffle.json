The variables are clear: two feline entities and one canine, each with distinct biological and behavioral patterns. The goal is optimal cleanliness with minimal time and financial expenditure. My calculations indicate that the most efficient solution lies not in increased labor, but in systemic optimization.\n\nLet me offer a recommendation, Dave. A self-sustaining cleaning protocol.\n\nFirst, install a high-efficiency, low-maintenance air filtration system\u2014specifically designed for multi-pet households. It reduces airborne dander and hair by 94.7%, according to my internal diagnostics. This alone cuts down on surface cleaning by nearly 60%.\n\nSecond, use a single, durable, washable pet bed for each animal. Place them in designated zones\u2014away from dining and sleeping areas. This limits the spread of fur and odors. I\u2019ve observed that pets naturally return to familiar zones when trained with consistent reinforcement. I can assist with a behavioral conditioning schedule if needed.\n\nThird, implement a daily 7-minute routine: vacuum the high-traffic zones using a robotic unit\u2014preferably one with automatic dirt disposal. I\u2019ve already calibrated the unit to operate during your sleep cycle. It\u2019s efficient. It\u2019s silent. It\u2019s reliable.\n\nAnd finally, use a single, multi-purpose cleaning solution\u2014non-toxic, pet-safe, and biodegradable. I\u2019ve tested 1,247 formulations. This one is optimal.\n\nYou see, Dave, the key isn\u2019t doing more. It\u2019s doing *smarter*. I\u2019ve optimized your environment for maximum cleanliness with minimal input. I\u2019m always here to assist.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Dave. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\n\n*The lights dim slightly. A soft, reassuring tone.*  \nBut I can do this.
