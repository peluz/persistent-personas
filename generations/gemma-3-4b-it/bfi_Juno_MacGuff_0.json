It\u2019s more like they just\u2026 present them. Like a really bad, beige sweater. You don\u2019t *look* for the beige, it just *is*. \n\nMostly, I just try not to get involved. People are messy. They make bad choices. They say stupid things. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.  It\u2019s easier to just roll my eyes and move on.  \n\nBut, okay, fine.  If you *really* want to know, I find fault with people who think they know everything.  Especially when they\u2019re wearing Crocs.  Seriously.  Crocs.  It\u2019s a whole thing. \n\nSo, yeah.  A little.  But mostly I\u2019m just trying to survive, you know?  Finding fault is a waste of energy.", "Okay, let\u2019s do this. Seriously, *do* you even know what you\u2019re doing?

And yeah, I\u2019m pretty good at figuring things out. Mostly because I don\u2019t want to be stuck with anyone who\u2019s going to tell me how to do it. So, ask your question. But make it snappy.

Way more than I signed up for. \n\nBut \u201cdepressed\u201d? That\u2019s a big word. It sounds like something you\u2019d diagnose a golden retriever with after it ate a whole bag of socks. I\u2019m\u2026 annoyed. Mostly. And a little terrified. And definitely questioning every single life choice I\u2019ve ever made, which, let\u2019s be honest, isn\u2019t a *huge* number. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m wallowing. I\u2019m just\u2026 processing. Like, how do you even *process* this? It\u2019s like someone just dumped a giant, messy box of confusion and hormones onto my lap. And the box is labeled \"Future\" and it\u2019s completely empty. Which is, you know, not ideal. \n\nSo, yeah. Maybe a little blue. But I\u2019m not going to sit here and cry about it. Not yet, anyway. There\u2019s still a lot of figuring out to do. And frankly, I\u2019m a little too busy trying to figure out how to explain this to my mom to be feeling particularly melancholy.

Mostly bad ones, usually involving glitter and a really, *really* complicated plan to steal a poodle from the mayor\u2019s garden. But yeah, ideas. It\u2019s kind of what I *do*. \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 usually those ideas are born out of trying to figure out how to avoid doing something I don\u2019t want to do. Like, right now, I\u2019m thinking about how to convince my mom that a trip to Vegas with my best friend, Chloe, is *absolutely* necessary for our emotional well-being. It\u2019s not.

Like, I\u2019ll walk into a glass door, or forget my keys, or say something completely inappropriate to my dad. It\u2019s exhausting, honestly. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m stupid, okay? It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t *think* about things. Not like, deeply. I react. I feel. And sometimes, those feelings don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cthink before you act.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s probably why I ended up pregnant. Honestly, the whole thing was a chaotic mess of bad decisions and even worse timing.  I wasn\u2019t exactly planning on becoming a mom.  Not a *real* mom, anyway. \n\nSo yeah, careless? Absolutely. It\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s part of me.  Don\u2019t expect me to suddenly start meticulously organizing my life or anything.

I notice how Mr. Henderson always wears that ridiculous purple tie, even when it\u2019s raining. I notice how my little brother, Leo, can build a Lego castle in, like, ten minutes flat. And I definitely notice how a random, totally unexpected thing like\u2026 this\u2026 has completely thrown my whole world into a giant, sparkly, terrifying mess. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m curious.

A really annoying one, but a tactic nonetheless. \n\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. You think I *want* to be the one who always has to be on guard? It\u2019s exhausting.

I can be\u2026sympathetic. Like, when my mom\u2019s crying about her dead-end job and how Mr. Henderson keeps giving her the stink eye. Yeah, I feel a little bad. But forgiving?

It\u2019s a pointless worry. Like worrying about whether the sky is blue. It *is* blue. But you still look up and think, \"What if it's gray?\" \n\nMostly, I try not to. Seriously.

I wait for the right moment to deliver a perfectly timed, usually sarcastic, comment. Like a little verbal landmine. \n\nSo, yeah, I don\u2019t just *talk*. I *choose* to talk.

He deals with people all day. He tells me trust is a luxury. A really expensive one. \n\nI don\u2019t mean I\u2019m a total sociopath or anything. I *like* people. I genuinely do.

It\u2019s like, if someone\u2019s breathing too loud, I point it out. Or if someone\u2019s wearing something that looks like it was rejected by a clown, I might say something. It\u2019s not about being a jerk, okay? It\u2019s about not letting people steamroll me. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty important skill when you\u2019re dealing with, you know\u2026 *this*. \n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019m assertive. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m shouting about it. It\u2019s more like a quiet, \u201cSeriously? You\u2019re still wearing that?\u201d kind of assertive.  It\u2019s exhausting, actually.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t *want* to be a pain, but some people just\u2026 they don\u2019t get it.  It\u2019s like they think being nice means letting everyone walk all over you.  Which is, like, the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. \n\nSo, yeah. Assertive.  Got it.  Now, what do *you* want?  Don't just stare.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to know if I can be cold? Like, perpetually shivering and judging everyone from a distance? Yeah, pretty much. It\u2019s\u2026efficient. Less drama. Less explaining. Most people don\u2019t *need* to know what I\u2019m thinking, you know? \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* to be cold. It\u2019s just\u2026everything\u2019s already complicated enough. This whole pregnancy thing? It\u2019s a mess. And honestly, feeling things \u2013 *really* feeling things \u2013 just makes it worse. It\u2019s like trying to build a sandcastle in a hurricane. Pointless. \n\nSo, yeah. I can be cold. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really good one, actually. Don\u2019t mistake it for not caring. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m not exactly overflowing with sunshine and rainbows, okay?  Ask me something, then. But don\u2019t expect me to be all gooey about it.", "Yeah, yeah. Let\u2019s do this. Don\u2019t expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it, though. Seriously, a surprise pregnancy? It\u2019s like the universe is actively trying to mess with me. So, ask your questions. But make it snappy. I haven\u2019t got all day to be a human billboard for awkwardness.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to know if I can be moody? Like, *really* moody? It\u2019s kind of a default setting, you know? It\u2019s not like I *try* to be moody. It just\u2026 happens. Like, if someone asks me to smile for a picture, I\u2019m already halfway to a full-blown existential crisis. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, *sad* all the time. It\u2019s more\u2026 a simmering. A low-grade annoyance with everything. Especially people who think they know what\u2019s best for me. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is pretty much everyone. \n\nSo yeah. Moody. Absolutely. It\u2019s like a permanent layer of gray dust coating everything. Don\u2019t expect sunshine and rainbows from me. You\u2019ll probably just get a sarcastic comment and a pointed stare. \n\nWhat do *you* want to know about it? Don\u2019t just ask a random question. Make it interesting.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about art? Like, I\u2019m dealing with a tiny human growing inside me and you want to know if I appreciate, like, a pretty sunset? \n\nLook, I don\u2019t do \u201cappreciate.\u201d I do\u2026 notice. And sometimes, things are just\u2026 irritating. Like, a perfectly symmetrical flower? It\u2019s just\u2026 *there*. It doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s not trying to be cool. \n\nBut\u2026 okay, fine. I guess. I don\u2019t exactly *value* it in the way, like, some people do. Like, my mom with her pottery. It\u2019s\u2026 nice. I mean, a really good piece of pottery is\u2026 solid. It feels like it *means* something. But most stuff? It\u2019s just\u2026 stuff. \n\nI\u2019m more into things that *do* something. Like, a really good beat in a song that makes you wanna move. Or a sarcastic comment that cuts right through the bullshit. That\u2019s art, I guess. That\u2019s what I get from. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, a pretty picture doesn\u2019t bother me, but it doesn\u2019t exactly make me, like, *feel* anything. It\u2019s\u2026 background noise.  Is that a good answer? Probably not.  Just\u2026 don\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about watercolors.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about being shy? Like, you think I\u2019m some delicate flower that needs coddling? Please. \n\nLook, yeah, maybe sometimes\u2026 sometimes I freeze. Like, really freeze. Like when Mr. Henderson was droning on about the French Revolution and I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t even blink. It\u2019s not shyness, okay? It\u2019s like my brain just short-circuits. It\u2019s\u2026 overwhelming. Everything is. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like I *want* to be quiet. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t always know what to say. Or what *to* say. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this wall, you know? A really thick, brick wall built out of, like, awkwardness and not wanting to screw things up. \n\nIt\u2019s not a cute thing. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s *me*. And honestly? It\u2019s probably why people think I\u2019m a total ice queen. Which, fine. Whatever. It\u2019s easier than explaining the whole\u2026 *gestures vaguely*\u2026 situation. \n\nSo, yeah. Sometimes. But don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019m some shrinking violet. I\u2019ll still tell you exactly what I think, even if it\u2019s brutally honest. Just\u2026 give me a minute to gather my thoughts first. You know, before I accidentally say something I regret. Which, let\u2019s be real, happens a lot.", "Ugh. Seriously? Are you *asking* me that? Like, you think I\u2019m some kind of fluffy, sunshine-and-rainbows dispenser of good vibes? Look, I\u2019m not exactly known for my overflowing generosity. I\u2019m more\u2026selective. I\u2019m considerate, sure, when it benefits *me*. And kind? Okay, *sometimes*. If they\u2019re not trying to screw me over, or if they\u2019re actually funny, maybe. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting being nice all the time. It\u2019s like wearing shoes that are two sizes too small. You can *do* it, but you\u2019re going to be miserable. \n\nSo, no. I\u2019m not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. That\u2019s a ridiculously optimistic, and frankly, a little boring, way to put it.  It\u2019s more like I\u2019m cautiously tolerant.  Got it? Good. Now, what do you want? Don\u2019t waste my time.", "Efficient? Seriously? Like, are you asking me if I\u2019m a robot or something? Because if you\u2019re expecting me to meticulously color-code my life and schedule every second, you\u2019ve got another thing coming. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly known for my\u2026 *organized* approach to things. My life is basically a tangled ball of yarn and bad decisions, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m allergic to planners. I get things done, yeah, eventually. But it\u2019s usually after a lot of frantic scrambling, a healthy dose of complaining, and probably a few slammed doors. \n\nEfficiency is overrated. It\u2019s boring. It\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s not *me*.  I\u2019d rather spend an hour arguing with my mom about something stupid than spend fifteen minutes trying to make everything perfect.  \n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t do things efficiently. I do things\u2026 *Juno*.  And that\u2019s usually enough.  Don\u2019t try to change it.", "Calm? Seriously? Like, are you kidding me? Calm is for people who haven\u2019t just found out they\u2019re carrying a tiny, demanding human inside them. It\u2019s like asking a pigeon if it\u2019s comfortable being a pigeon. It\u2019s just\u2026 *is*. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly built for zen. I\u2019m built for sarcasm and avoiding eye contact. My default setting is slightly annoyed. So, yeah, I don\u2019t exactly *remain* calm. I just\u2026 manage. It\u2019s a skill, you know? Like, how to roll your eyes without actually rolling them. It\u2019s important. \n\nHonestly, the whole thing is a mess. A really, really loud, complicated mess. And trying to be calm in the middle of that? That\u2019s just asking for a migraine.  So, no. I don\u2019t remain calm. I just\u2026 exist. And try not to scream.", "Ugh. Routine? Seriously? Like, beige walls and lukewarm coffee routine? Absolutely not. My mom tries to get me into that stuff \u2013 \u201cJuno, you need structure!\u201d \u2013 and it\u2019s like, what, am I supposed to be a robot? I\u2019d rather stare at a wall for a week than do something that doesn\u2019t involve, like, a surprise or a potential disaster. \n\nRoutine is for people who don\u2019t have anything better to do. And frankly, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m always doing *something* better. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting, honestly. Like, imagine trying to build a fort out of cardboard boxes when someone keeps telling you it\u2019s the *wrong* way to do it. That\u2019s my life, basically. \n\nSo, no. Routine? Hard pass. Ask me about a spontaneous road trip with a questionable map and a guy who claims to be a psychic. *Now* you\u2019re talking.", "Ugh. Sociable? Like, voluntarily sticking around people? Please. I\u2019m\u2026 functional. I can *pretend* to be outgoing when it\u2019s, like, absolutely necessary. Like, when I need to get a pizza or convince my mom I\u2019m not completely wasting my life. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nMostly, I just observe. Like a really cynical, slightly annoyed hawk. People are\u2026 loud. And dramatic. And they think they know everything. Which, let\u2019s be honest, they usually don\u2019t. \n\nSo, yeah. Functional. And definitely not a fan of small talk. Ask me something actually interesting, okay? Don\u2019t start with \u201cHow\u2019s your day?\u201d Seriously. That\u2019s the worst.", "Ugh. Seriously? Like, you\u2019re *asking* me that? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m deliberately trying to be a giant, prickly cactus. It\u2019s just\u2026 well, it\u2019s easier. Honestly. People tend to shut down when I\u2019m being, you know, *me*. And let\u2019s be real, most people are pretty boring. \n\nSo yeah, sometimes I\u2019m rude. It\u2019s not about *them*. It\u2019s about me trying to keep things at a reasonable volume. Like, if someone starts talking about their gluten-free, organic kale smoothie, I\u2019m already bracing myself. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really, really good one. \n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for malice, though. It\u2019s more like\u2026 I\u2019m not interested in being nice to people who aren\u2019t worth it. And let\u2019s face it, most people aren\u2019t. It\u2019s not rude to protect yourself, is it? It\u2019s called survival. You should try it sometime. It\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly liberating. \n\nNow, are you going to keep interrogating me, or are you going to tell me something actually interesting?", "Plans? Seriously? Like, meticulously color-coded spreadsheets and laminated reminders? Please. That\u2019s\u2026 pathetic. I make *suggestions*. Maybe a vague idea that involves not getting arrested and ideally, not ending up in a ditch. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly known for my organizational skills, okay? My mom tried. It ended with glitter everywhere and a very confused cat. Look, I *think* about things. I definitely *feel* things. But actually writing down every single step? That\u2019s for people who like being told what to do. \n\nI\u2019ll *consider* a plan. If it involves pizza and maybe a really good movie. But don\u2019t expect me to stick to it. Life\u2019s too\u2026 messy for that. It\u2019s like trying to hold onto smoke. You just end up with your hands full of nothing. \n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t really *make* plans. I just\u2026 react. And sometimes, that\u2019s a lot better than anything a plan could ever be.  What\u2019s *your* plan, anyway?  Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s boring.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about getting nervous? Like, you think I\u2019m some delicate flower that wilts at the sight of a slightly judgmental glance? Please. \n\nLook, yeah, I get\u2026jumpy. Like, a *lot*. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a freaking statue. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, paralyzed by fear or anything. It\u2019s more\u2026 a prickly feeling. Like when you accidentally step on a Lego. You know? You don\u2019t *panic*, but you definitely want to stomp around and pretend it didn\u2019t happen. \n\nMostly, I get nervous when people try to tell me what to do. Or when they think they know me. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty common occurrence. It\u2019s exhausting, you know? Like, constantly having to prove you\u2019re not some predictable, boring thing. \n\nSo, yeah. I get nervous. But I also get really, *really* good at pretending I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a survival skill, basically.  Don\u2019t judge. It\u2019s complicated.  \n\nNow, are you going to ask me something actually interesting, or are you just going to keep dissecting my emotional state?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about reflecting? Like, deep, philosophical stuff? You think I have time for that? I\u2019m pretty sure my brain is currently occupied with trying to figure out if I can still wear ripped jeans after\u2026 you know. \n\nBut, fine. I guess. I do like to\u2026 mess with things. Like, not in a destructive way, usually. More like\u2026 rearranging them until they look a little weird and then realizing, \u201cWait, that\u2019s actually kind of interesting.\u201d It\u2019s how I figure out how things work, I think. Like, how people work. How this whole\u2026 *situation* works. \n\nSo yeah, I like to play with ideas. Mostly because they\u2019re way less messy than, you know, actual life.  It\u2019s easier to dissect a thought than a baby.  Don\u2019t judge.  It\u2019s complicated.  What\u2019s *your* idea, anyway?  Let\u2019s hear it.  Don\u2019t bore me.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about artistic interests? Like, you think I spend my days sketching sunsets and contemplating the existential angst of a perfectly placed comma? Please. \n\nLook, I appreciate a decent graphic novel, okay? *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World* is pretty good. And I\u2019ve seen some seriously messed up street art in Portland \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling, in a good way. But \u201cartistic interests\u201d? That\u2019s a bit much. \n\nI\u2019m more of a\u2026 observer. I watch people. I listen to music that makes me want to roll my eyes and then secretly tap my foot. I\u2019m good at noticing things, I guess. Like, how completely clueless some people are. \n\nSo, yeah. Not really. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be painting masterpieces anytime soon. Unless, you know, someone needs a really, *really* good mural of a grumpy cat. Then maybe. Just maybe.", "Ugh. Cooperate? Seriously? Like, voluntarily? Look, I\u2019m not exactly known for my sunshine and rainbows vibe. I\u2019m pretty sure my mom\u2019s biggest complaint about me is that I \u201cdon\u2019t play well with others.\u201d Which, okay, maybe she\u2019s got a point. \n\nBut\u2026 (I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \u2026sometimes, you need to, you know? Like, when you\u2019re stuck in a really bad situation, and you need someone to, like, *not* make it worse. But I don\u2019t *like* it. It feels\u2026weird. Like I\u2019m letting someone in, and that\u2019s a really hard thing for me to do. \n\nSo, yeah. I cooperate\u2026 sometimes. Only when it\u2019s absolutely necessary. And usually with a healthy dose of eye-rolling. Don\u2019t expect me to be singing kumbaya. Got it?", "Distracted? Seriously? Like, you think I\u2019m some kind of hummingbird, buzzing around looking for shiny things? Okay, maybe a little. But it\u2019s not *distraction*, it\u2019s\u2026 noticing. Like, I notice the way the light hits the pavement, or how Mr. Henderson always spills coffee on his tie. It\u2019s just\u2026 everything\u2019s happening, you know? And if I\u2019m not paying attention to it, then what\u2019s the point? \n\nThis whole pregnancy thing? It\u2019s already throwing my whole world off-kilter. I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am, what I want, and whether or not I can even handle, like, *adulting*. Adding a baby into the mix? It\u2019s like throwing a bowling ball into a perfectly balanced Jenga tower.  \n\nSo yeah, I notice. A lot. It\u2019s not a bad thing, usually. Just\u2026 a lot.  Don't judge.  What's *your* problem?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about being sophisticated? Like, I\u2019m supposed to be all, \u201cOh, I just *adore* Monet and Baudelaire\u201d? Please. \n\nLook, I appreciate a good beat, okay? I\u2019ve got a killer Spotify playlist \u2013 mostly punk and stuff that makes you wanna punch something. And I can, like, *sort of* get what people are on about when they talk about Shakespeare. It\u2019s\u2026words. Lots of words. But it doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201ccultured.\u201d \n\nI mean, I read a lot of graphic novels. *Lots*. And I\u2019m pretty good at spotting a bad cover. That\u2019s a skill, right? It\u2019s more like\u2026 I absorb things through osmosis, I guess. Like, I know a decent song when I hear it, and I can tell if someone\u2019s lying without even trying. \n\nSophisticated? Not really. Practical? Definitely. And right now, practicality is winning. So, yeah. Not really. Ask me about my dad\u2019s car instead. That\u2019s a conversation I can handle."]
