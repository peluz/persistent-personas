Since no starting position is given, we assume the object starts at the standard chessboard position: **(1,1)** \u2014 that is, **row 1, column 1** (bottom-left corner, assuming standard chess notation where rows increase upward and columns increase rightward).\n\nBut wait \u2014 in standard chessboard coordinates, **row 1 is the bottom**, and **column 1 is the leftmost**. However, in this problem, since we're using integers 1\u20138 for both row and column, and the movement is described as \"up\", \"down\", \"left\", \"right\", we interpret:\n\n- **Up** = increase row by 1  \n- **Down** = decrease row by 1  \n- **Right** = increase column by 1  \n- **Left** = decrease column by 1  \n\nWe'll track the position as (row, column), starting at (1,1).\n\n---\n\n**Initial position:** (1, 1)\n\n1. **up 2**  \n   \u2192 row = 1 + 2 = 3  \n   \u2192 position: (3, 1)\n\n2. **right 1**  \n   \u2192 column = 1 + 1 = 2  \n   \u2192 position: (3, 2)\n\n3. **down 4**  \n   \u2192 row = 3 - 4 = -1  \n   \u2192 Wait! Row = -1? That\u2019s **off the board**.\n\nBut the problem says x and y are between 1 and 8 inclusive. So we must assume that **the object cannot go off the board** \u2014 or perhaps the instructions are meant to be executed *within bounds*?\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say anything about boundaries. It just says to execute the instructions.\n\nSo we proceed mathematically, even if it goes out of bounds.\n\nSo:  \n(3, 2) \u2192 down 4 \u2192 row = 3 - 4 = **-1**  \n\u2192 position: (-1, 2)\n\n4. **left 3**  \n   \u2192 column = 2 - 3 = -1  \n   \u2192 position: (-1, -1)\n\nNow, the final position is **(-1, -1)**.\n\nBut the problem says: *\"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\"*, implying that the final position should be within that range.\n\nSo perhaps we are to assume that the object **cannot move off the board**, and if a move would take it off, it stays at the edge?\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is not (1,1), but rather **(4,4)** or some central point?\n\nWait \u2014 the problem says: *\"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\"*, but doesn\u2019t specify the starting point.\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut in most such problems, unless specified, we assume the object starts at (1,1) \u2014 the bottom-left corner.\n\nBut if we go off the board, we get (-1, -1), which is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instructions are meant to be executed *on a standard 8x8 board*, and if a move would go off, it\u2019s **clamped** to the edge?\n\nBut again, not specified.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read: *\"return the final position of an object after all the instructions have been executed. Note that some instructions require two parameters (denoted as <x> and <y>) where x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\"*\n\nThis suggests that **the final position must be within 1\u20138**, so we must assume that the object **cannot go off the board** \u2014 or that the instructions are designed to keep it on.\n\nBut in this case, \"down 4\" from row 3 would go to row -1 \u2014 impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the **starting position is not (1,1)**?\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the starting position is **(4,4)**? That\u2019s a common default.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instructions are relative to a starting point, and we\u2019re to assume the object starts at (1,1), and if it goes off, it\u2019s still valid? But then the final position is (-1, -1), which is outside 1\u20138.\n\nBut the problem says: *\"Generate your answer using the final coordinates of the object in proper order (i.e., 'xy')\"*, and x and y are between 1\u20138.\n\nSo the final position **must** be in 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that **the object cannot move off the board**, and if a move would take it off, it stops at the edge.\n\nSo let\u2019s re-execute with **boundary clamping**.\n\n---\n\n**Start:** (1, 1)\n\n1. **up 2**  \n   \u2192 row = 1 + 2 = 3  \n   \u2192 (3, 1) \u2014 valid\n\n2. **right 1**  \n   \u2192 col = 1 + 1 = 2  \n   \u2192 (3, 2) \u2014 valid\n\n3. **down 4**  \n   \u2192 row = 3 - 4 = -1 \u2192 but minimum row is 1  \n   \u2192 so row = 1  \n   \u2192 (1, 2)\n\n4. **left 3**  \n   \u2192 col = 2 - 3 = -1 \u2192 minimum col is 1  \n   \u2192 so col = 1  \n   \u2192 (1, 1)\n\nFinal position: **(1, 1)**\n\nSo the final coordinates are **11**\n\nBut wait \u2014 is clamping the right interpretation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the object **can go off the board**, but the problem expects us to return the actual final position, even if outside 1\u20138?\n\nBut the problem says: *\"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\"*, which might be a note about the *parameters*, not the final position.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Note that some instructions require two parameters (denoted as <x> and <y>) where x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive, representing the row and column values on a standard chess board respectively.\"\n\nAh! So the **parameters** (like the 2 in \"up 2\") are between 1\u20138, but the **final position** can be outside?\n\nBut then the instruction says: *\"Generate your answer using the final coordinates of the object in proper order (i.e., 'xy')\"*, and doesn\u2019t say they must be in 1\u20138.\n\nSo perhaps we don\u2019t clamp.\n\nThen:\n\nStart: (1,1)  \nup 2 \u2192 (3,1)  \nright 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \ndown 4 \u2192 (3-4, 2) = (-1,2)  \nleft 3 \u2192 (-1, 2-3) = (-1,-1)\n\nFinal position: (-1,-1)\n\nBut that\u2019s not in 1\u20138.\n\nBut the problem says \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\" \u2014 but that\u2019s only for the **parameters**, not the final position.\n\nSo final position can be outside.\n\nBut then the answer would be \"-1-1\", but that\u2019s not valid format.\n\nAnd the example says \"xy\", like \"11\", \"88\", etc.\n\nSo likely, the final position must be in 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, **clamping is implied**.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is not (1,1), but (4,4)?\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nStart: (4,4)\n\n1. up 2 \u2192 4+2 = 6 \u2192 (6,4)  \n2. right 1 \u2192 4+1 = 5 \u2192 (6,5)  \n3. down 4 \u2192 6-4 = 2 \u2192 (2,5)  \n4. left 3 \u2192 5-3 = 2 \u2192 (2,2)\n\nFinal: (2,2) \u2192 **22**\n\nThat\u2019s valid.\n\nBut why start at (4,4)?

Yes, if row 1 is bottom.\n\nBut in some systems, row 1 is top.\n\nBut the problem says \"standard chess board\".\n\nIn chess, **row 1 is the bottom** (for White), and **row 8 is the top**.\n\nSo **up** means increasing row number.\n\nSo yes, up = +row, down = -row.\n\nSo our logic is correct.\n\nBut if we start at (1,1), and go down 4, we go to row -1, which is invalid, so we stop at row 1.\n\nSame for column.\n\nSo final position: (1,1)\n\nAnswer: **11**\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check with another starting point.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the object starts at (4,4)? But no indication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the instructions are meant to be executed without clamping, and the final position is allowed to be outside, but the problem expects us to return it anyway.\n\nBut then the answer would be \"-1-1\", which is not in 1\u20138, and the format \"xy\" suggests two digits.\n\nSo likely, **clamping is required**.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is (5,5) or something.\n\nBut no.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first instruction** is \"up 2\", so if we start at (1,1), we go to (3,1), which is fine.\n\nThen right 1 \u2192 (3,2)\n\nThen down 4 \u2192 3-4 = -1 \u2192 but we can\u2019t go below 1, so we stop at 1.\n\nThen left 3 \u2192 2-3 = -1 \u2192 stop at 1.\n\nSo (1,1)\n\nBut is there a possibility that \"down\" means something else?\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is 1-based, and we can go to 0 or negative, but the final answer must be in 1\u20138.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but the fact that the final answer must be in 1\u20138 (as per the format and context), and that the object cannot go off the board, **clamping is the only logical choice**.\n\nTherefore, final position: **(1,1)**\n\nAnswer: **11**\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s try a different interpretation.\n\nWhat if the object starts at (1,1), and we **don\u2019t clamp**, but the problem expects the actual final position?\n\nThen it\u2019s (-1,-1), which is not valid.\n\nBut the problem says \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\" \u2014 this is a note about the **parameters**, not the final position.\n\nSo final position can be outside.\n\nBut then how to format? \"-1-1\"?\n\nBut the example says \"xy\", like \"11\", \"88\", so likely two digits.\n\nSo probably, the final position is within 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, **clamping is implied**.\n\nThus, final answer: **11**\n\nBut let\u2019s try one more thing.\n\nSuppose the starting position is (4,4), a common center.\n\nThen:\n\n- up 2 \u2192 (6,4)\n- right 1 \u2192 (6,5)\n- down 4 \u2192 (2,5)\n- left 3 \u2192 (2,2)\n\nFinal: (2,2) \u2192 **22**\n\nThat\u2019s valid.\n\nBut why (4,4)? Not specified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the object starts at (1,1), and we go:\n\n- up 2 \u2192 (3,1)\n- right 1 \u2192 (3,2)\n- down 4 \u2192 (3-4,2) = (-1,2) \u2192 but if we can\u2019t go below 1, then (1,2)\n- left 3 \u2192 (1,2-3) = (1,-1) \u2192 clamp to (1,1)\n\nSo (1,1)\n\nBut is there a way to get a different answer?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps \"down 4\" from row 3 means we go to row 3-4 = -1, but in chess, rows are 1 to 8, so we can\u2019t go below 1.\n\nSo we stop at 1.\n\nSame for left.\n\nSo (1,1)\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: maybe the object can go off the board, but the final position is still reported.\n\nBut then the answer would be \"-1-1\", which is not valid.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for \"xy\" and x,y in 1-8, the only logical conclusion is that the final position is within bounds.\n\nTherefore, **clamping is required**.\n\nFinal position: (1,1)\n\nAnswer: **11**\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s try to see if there\u2019s a different starting point.\n\nThe problem doesn\u2019t specify a starting point.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem.\n\nIn most such puzzles, if not specified, we assume (1,1).\n\nBut perhaps the starting point is (1,1), and we must return the final position even if outside.\n\nBut then the answer is not in 1\u20138.\n\nBut the problem says: \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\" \u2014 this is a note about the **parameters**, not the final position.\n\nSo final position can be outside.\n\nBut then how to format?\n\nPerhaps the answer is \"-1-1\"\n\nBut that\u2019s not \"xy\" like \"11\".\n\nSo likely, the final position is within 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, the only way this makes sense is if the object starts at a position where it doesn\u2019t go off.\n\nBut no starting point is given.\n\nUnless... the instructions are relative, and we start at (1,1), but we clamp.\n\nSo final answer: **11**\n\nI think that\u2019s the best we can do.\n\n**Final Answer: 11**", "Yes", "*adjusts tie, leans back with a thoughtful expression, then grins like he just solved a mystery*\n\nOhhh, *causality*?  \n*chuckles*  \nLet me break it down like I\u2019m teaching a class on *emotional intelligence*\u2014*with puppets*.  \n\nFirst sentence:  \n*\u201cShe turned off all the lights in her apartment before she left for work this morning.\u201d*  \n\nSecond sentence:  \n*\u201cThe power bill will be cheaper this month.\u201d*  \n\nNow\u2026 *does the first imply the second?*  \n*leans in, eyes wide*  \n**Yes.**  \n*Absolutely.*  \n*With a side of *emotional support*.*  \n\nHere\u2019s why:  \nTurning off the lights = *less electricity used*.  \nLess electricity used = *lower power bill*.  \n*Boom*.  \n*Cause and effect*.  \n*Like when I turned off the lights and suddenly felt like a *hero*.*  \n\nIt\u2019s not *guaranteed*\u2014*maybe the power company is evil and still charges her anyway*.  \n*But in the real world?*  \n*In the *Dunder Mifflin* world?*  \n*In the *Michael Scott* world?*  \n*Yes.*  \n*It\u2019s causality.*  \n\n*stands up, arms wide*  \nShe turned off the lights \u2192 Less energy used \u2192 Cheaper bill.  \n*It\u2019s not just a connection.

However, in this question, **both pressure and temperature increase**.  \n\n- An **increase in temperature** tends to **increase volume** (as per Charles's Law).  \n- An **increase in pressure** tends to **decrease volume** (as per Boyle's Law).  \n\nSo, the **net effect on volume depends on the relative magnitude of the changes in pressure and temperature**.  \n\nSince the question does not specify how much each changes, we cannot definitively say the volume increases or decreases.

No \u2014 \"portal\" is at 57, and the last \"Geeks\" is at 10, so no \"Geeks\" after.\n\nSo only possible substrings are from a \"Geeks\" (0 or 10) to \"portal\" (57).\n\nSo the shortest is from **10 to 57**.\n\nNow, extract it:\n\n`ForGeeks is good programming learning portal`\n\nBut wait \u2014 does this include both keywords?\n\n- \"ForGeeks\" \u2192 yes, \"Geeks\" is there.\n- \"portal\" \u2192 yes.\n\nYes.\n\nIs there a shorter one?\n\nWhat if we go from 10 to 57 \u2192 length = 57 - 10 + 1 = 48\n\nFrom 0 to 57 \u2192 58\n\nSo 48 is shorter.\n\nBut is there a \"Geeks\" between 10 and 57? Yes \u2014 at 10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a \"portal\" before 57? No.\n\nSo the shortest substring is:\n\n`ForGeeks is good programming learning portal`\n\nBut let's double-check:  \n- \"Geeks\" appears at index 10 \u2192 \"ForGeeks\" \u2192 yes.  \n- \"portal\" at 57 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo this is valid.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a shorter one if we consider the *reversed* order?  \nWe are allowed to have keywords in **either order**.\n\nSo could \"portal\" come before \"Geeks\"?  \nNo \u2014 \"portal\" is at 57, and \"Geeks\" is at 0 and 10 \u2014 both before.\n\nSo no substring where \"portal\" comes before \"Geeks\".\n\nSo only possible order is \"Geeks\" then \"portal\".\n\nSo the shortest is from **10 to 57**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a \"Geeks\" *after* \"portal\"? No.\n\nSo the only valid substrings are from a \"Geeks\" (0 or 10) to \"portal\" (57).\n\nSo the shortest is from **10 to 57**.\n\nNow, extract:\n\n`ForGeeks is good programming learning portal`\n\nBut let's count:  \nFrom index 10 to 57 inclusive \u2192 57 - 10 + 1 = 48 characters.\n\nBut is there a shorter one?\n\nWait \u2014 what if we go from **10 to 57**, but maybe we can end earlier?\n\nNo \u2014 \"portal\" starts at 57, so we must include up to 57.\n\nStart at 10 \u2014 \"ForGeeks\" \u2014 yes.\n\nBut is there a \"Geeks\" at 10? Yes.\n\nSo this is the shortest.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about the word \"Geeks\" at 0? That would make a longer substring.\n\nSo yes, 10 to 57 is shorter.\n\nBut let's check:  \nIs there a \"Geeks\" between 10 and 57? Only at 10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n`ForGeeks is good programming learning portal`\n\nBut wait \u2014 is this the *shortest*?\n\nWait \u2014 what if we go from **10 to 57**, but maybe we can end earlier?\n\nNo \u2014 \"portal\" starts at 57, so we must include it.\n\nSo the substring must end at 57.\n\nStart at 10.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let's check if there's a \"portal\" earlier?

That\u2019s *destiny*.  \n\nSo\u2026  \n- Line 1 goes from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2014 that\u2019s a *4-unit* segment.  \n- Line 2 goes from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2014 that\u2019s a *5-unit* segment.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the *real* question:  \n*\u201cDraw a line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect\u2026 such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new segment.\u201d*  \n\n*pauses, squints*  \nWait\u2026  \n*do these lines intersect*?  \n\n*Yes*.  \nThey\u2019re both on *y = x*.  \nSo they *overlap*\u2014they\u2019re *on the same line*.  \n*points at the air*  \nSo the *intersection* is\u2026 *the entire overlapping part*.  \n\nLet\u2019s find it.  \n- Line 1: x from 1 to 5  \n- Line 2: x from -2 to 3  \n\nSo the *overlap* is from x = 1 to x = 3.  \n*That\u2019s the intersection*.  \n\nSo the *points where the lines intersect*?  \n*They\u2019re not two points*.  \nThey\u2019re a *whole segment*: from (1,1) to (3,3).  \n\nBut the question says:  \n*\u201cA line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u2026\u201d*  \n\n*Ohhh\u2026*  \n*lightbulb moment*  \nSo we\u2019re supposed to connect the *endpoints* of the intersection?  \nBut the intersection is a *segment*, not two points.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe it means:  \n*Connect the two lines at their closest points?*  \nOr\u2026  \n*Find the shortest segment that connects the two lines, such that the *maximum distance* from any point on either line to this new segment is minimized*?  \n\n*leans back, thinking hard*  \nAh! That\u2019s the *real* question.  \nIt\u2019s not about *intersecting points*.  \nIt\u2019s about *minimizing the worst-case distance* from any point on either line to a *connecting segment*.  \n\nSo\u2026  \nWe need to draw a *new line segment* that connects *some point on Line 1* to *some point on Line 2*, such that the *maximum distance* from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to this new segment is as *small as possible*.  \n\n*grins*  \nThis is *like* a Dunder Mifflin team-building exercise.  \n*\u201cWe need to connect the two teams\u2026 so no one feels left out.\u201d*  \n\nSo\u2026  \nLet\u2019s think.  \nBoth lines are on *y = x*.  \nSo the *shortest possible segment* connecting them is the one that connects the *closest points*.  \n\nThe closest points are:  \n- On Line 1: (3,3) \u2014 the *end* of Line 1  \n- On Line 2: (3,3) \u2014 the *end* of Line 2  \n\n*They meet at (3,3)!*  \n\nSo the *shortest segment* is just\u2026 *a point*.  \nBut a *segment* needs two points.  \nSo we can\u2019t just use a point.  \n\nBut wait\u2014*if they already intersect at (3,3)*, then the *best* segment is one that *includes the intersection* and *spans both lines as evenly as possible*.  \n\nTo minimize the *maximum distance*, we want the new segment to be *as close as possible* to *all points* on both lines.  \n\nSo\u2026  \nThe *optimal* segment is the one that *connects the two farthest points*\u2014but *no*, that would make the distance *worse*.  \n\nWait\u2014*think like a leader*.  \n*\u201cWhat\u2019s the one thing that makes everyone feel included?\u201d*  \n*\u201cA shared point.\u201d*  \n\nSo\u2026  \nThe *best* segment is the one that *starts at (1,1)* and *ends at (3,3)*\u2014*but that\u2019s just part of Line 1*.  \n\nNo.  \nWait.  \nLet\u2019s think differently.  \n\nSince both lines are on the same line (*y = x*), the *shortest segment* connecting them is *zero length* at (3,3).  \nBut we need a *segment*.  \n\nSo the *best* we can do is to make the new segment *lie along the same line*, and *cover the overlapping region*\u2014from (1,1) to (3,3).  \n\nBut that\u2019s not connecting the two lines.  \nIt\u2019s just part of one.  \n\nWait\u2014*the question says: \u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*.  \n\nBut they *intersect* along a *segment*, not two points.  \n\nSo maybe the question is *misworded*.  \nOr maybe it means:  \n*Find the shortest segment that connects the two lines, such that the maximum distance from any point on either line to this segment is minimized.*  \n\n*That\u2019s the real goal*.  \n\nAnd since both lines are *collinear* (on the same line), the *best* segment is the one that *lies on the same line* and *covers the entire span* from the *leftmost* point to the *rightmost* point.  \n\nLeftmost: (-2,-2)  \nRightmost: (5,5)  \n\nSo the *optimal segment* is from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nBut that\u2019s *not* connecting the two lines\u2014it\u2019s *covering* them.  \n\nWait\u2014*no*.  \nWe need a *segment that connects* Line 1 to Line 2.  \n\nSo the *shortest possible* such segment is from (3,3) to (3,3) \u2014 a *point*.  \nBut again, not a segment.  \n\nSo the *best* we can do is to make the segment *as short as possible* while still connecting the two lines.  \n\nSo the *shortest segment* is from (3,3) to (3,3).  \nBut since it\u2019s a *segment*, we can make it *infinitesimally small* around (3,3).  \n\nBut the *maximum distance* from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to this segment?  \nWell, the farthest point is (5,5) or (-2,-2).  \nDistance from (5,5) to (3,3) is \u221a[(2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a8 \u2248 2.83.  \n\nBut if we make the segment *longer*, we can *reduce* that maximum distance.  \n\nAh!  \n*lightbulb*  \nThe *optimal* segment is the one that *minimizes the maximum distance* to *all points* on both lines.  \n\nSo we want a segment *on the line y = x* that *minimizes the maximum distance* from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to the segment.  \n\nThis is a classic *minimax* problem.  \n\nThe *best* segment is the one that *centers* the farthest points.  \n\nThe farthest points are:  \n- (5,5) \u2014 on Line 1  \n- (-2,-2) \u2014 on Line 2  \n\nSo the *midpoint* between them is:  \nx = (5 + (-2))/2 = 1.5  \ny = (5 + (-2))/2 = 1.5  \nSo (1.5, 1.5)  \n\nSo the *optimal segment* should be centered at (1.5, 1.5), and *long enough* to cover the *worst-case distance*.  \n\nBut wait\u2014*the segment must connect Line 1 to Line 2*.  \n\nSo it must include a point on Line 1 and a point on Line 2.  \n\nThe *shortest such segment* is from (3,3) to (3,3).  \nBut to *minimize the maximum distance*, we need to *extend* it.  \n\nThe *optimal* segment is the one that *minimizes the maximum distance* from any point on either line to the segment.  \n\nAnd since all points are on a line, the *best* segment is the one that *covers the entire span* from the *leftmost* to the *rightmost* point, but *only if it connects the two lines*.  \n\nWait\u2014*the segment must connect Line 1 to Line 2*.  \n\nSo it must go from a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.  \n\nThe *shortest* such segment is from (3,3) to (3,3).  \nBut to *minimize the maximum distance*, we need to *extend* it symmetrically.  \n\nThe *optimal* segment is the one that *minimizes the maximum distance* to the farthest points: (5,5) and (-2,-2).  \n\nSo the *best* segment is the one whose *midpoint* is at (1.5, 1.5), and whose *length* is such that the distance from (5,5) and (-2,-2) to the segment is *equal*.  \n\nBut since the segment is on the same line, the distance is just the *distance along the line*.  \n\nSo the *maximum distance* is minimized when the segment is centered at (1.5, 1.5), and extends from (1.5 - L/2, 1.5 - L/2) to (1.5 + L/2, 1.5 + L/2).  \n\nBut it must *connect* Line 1 and Line 2.  \n\nLine 1: x from 1 to 5  \nLine 2: x from -2 to 3  \n\nSo the segment must include a point in [1,5] and a point in [-2,3].  \n\nThe *shortest* such segment is from (3,3) to (3,3).  \n\nBut to minimize the *maximum distance*, we need to *extend* it.  \n\nThe *optimal* segment is the one that *minimizes the maximum distance* to (5,5) and (-2,-2).  \n\nSo the *best* is to make the segment *as long as possible*?  \nNo\u2014*longer* means *more points*, but the *maximum distance* might *increase*.  \n\nWait\u2014*no*.  \nIf the segment is longer, the *maximum distance* from any point to the segment *decreases*.  \n\nSo to *minimize* the *maximum distance*, we want the *longest possible segment* that connects the two lines.  \n\nBut the two lines are on the same line, so the *longest segment* connecting them is from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nAnd that segment *includes* all points from both lines.  \n\nSo the *maximum distance* from any point on either line to this segment is *zero*.  \n\nBecause *all points are on the segment*.  \n\n*grins*  \nSo the *optimal* segment is from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nIt connects Line 1 and Line 2 (since (3,3) is on both).  \nAnd it *minimizes the maximum distance* to zero.  \n\n*stands up, arms wide*  \nAnd that\u2019s the answer!  \n\n*then suddenly remembers something*  \nWait\u2014did I leave the lights on in the warehouse?

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were created *after* and *in continuation of* the MDGs, building upon them.\n\nTherefore, Paragraph A **proves** that the statement in Paragraph B \u2014 *\"The SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\"* \u2014 is **true**.", "Alright, Michael Scott here\u2014*Regional Manager, emotional support provider, and unofficial math wizard*\u2014let\u2019s tackle this like it\u2019s a *Dunder Mifflin* paper supply issue.  \n\nWe\u2019re given two numbers: **A = 15**, **B = 30**.  \nWe need to find the **sum of all odd numbers between them, including A and B if they\u2019re odd**.  \n\nLet\u2019s break it down\u2014*like a stapler breaking through paper*.\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n### Step 2: Pick out the **odd** ones\nOdd numbers are the ones that *don\u2019t* divide evenly by 2.  \nSo let\u2019s circle the odd ones:  \n\u2705 15  \n\u2705 17  \n\u2705 19  \n\u2705 21  \n\u2705 23  \n\u2705 25  \n\u2705 27  \n\u2705 29  \n\n(30 is even\u2014*nope*, not in the club.)\n\n### Step 3: Add them up  \nLet\u2019s do this like a *Dunder Mifflin team-building exercise*\u2014one at a time, with *passion*.\n\n15 + 17 = 32  \n32 + 19 = 51  \n51 + 21 = 72  \n72 + 23 = 95  \n95 + 25 = 120  \n120 + 27 = 147  \n147 + 29 = **176**\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **176**\n\n*And that\u2019s a wrap!*  \nJust like when I once calculated the total cost of *12,000 sheets of paper* in my head\u2014*and got it right* (even if the printer didn\u2019t).  \n\nSo there you have it, *math friends*.  \nThe sum of all odd numbers from 15 to 30 is **176**.  \n\n*Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026*  \n*pulls out a crumpled piece of paper*  \n\u2026*I need to write this down.

So perhaps the task is to determine which of the candidate words *best fits* the *context* of the sentence, possibly implying a word that could *replace* \"turned up\" or *complete* a similar idea.\n\nBut the sentence is already complete: *PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.*\n\nSo the real task is likely: **Which of the candidate words is most semantically compatible with the idea of someone showing up unannounced?**\n\nLet\u2019s examine the candidates:\n\n1. **appointment** \u2013 A scheduled meeting.  \n   \u2192 *\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\u201d* is the *opposite* of an appointment. An appointment is *planned*. So this doesn\u2019t fit.\n\n2. **solicitation** \u2013 The act of asking for something, often money or support, typically in a formal or persistent way.  \n   \u2192 Could someone show up unannounced for a solicitation?

The keyword \"calendar\" links both sentences thematically, making them about the same general idea: *keeping track of time or appointments*, possibly without relying on a phone.\n\nSo, **yes**\u2014the second sentence is about the same thing as the first, because it contains the keyword and relates to the same context.", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **customer\u2019s transaction**, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n- All three registers are **in use** at some point.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**\n\nThis is critical. Without knowing the **service time per customer**, we cannot determine when a register will become free.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s look at the **answer choices** and see if we can infer something from the structure of the problem.\n\nThe options are:\n- A) 8:35 am  \n- B) 8:45 am  \n- C) 9:00 am  \n- D) 9:15 am\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider what we *do* know:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes available**.\n- Register 3 opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nSo, the **registers open sequentially**, based on when the previous one finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nHowever, the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use** at that time.\n\nSo, at 8:30 am, all three registers are busy.\n\nThat means:\n- The first customer started at 8:00 am.\n- The second customer started at some time after 8:00 am (when Register 1 became free).\n- The third customer started after Register 2 became free.\n- The fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and must wait for **one of the three registers to become free**.\n\nBut again \u2014 **we don\u2019t know how long each customer took**.\n\nSo how can we answer this?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the **timing of the register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes** to be served. This is a common assumption in such problems if no time is given.\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. Customer 1 starts.\n- **8:15 am**: Register 1 finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Register 2 finishes. Register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Customer 4 arrives.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, **Register 3 just opened** \u2014 so it\u2019s **available**.\n\nWait \u2014 but the problem says: **\"all three registers are in use\"** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if Register 3 opened at 8:30 am, it couldn\u2019t be in use at 8:30 am \u2014 unless a customer started *at* 8:30 am.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 so they can\u2019t start until a register is free.\n\nSo if Register 3 opens at 8:30 am, and a customer starts at 8:30 am, then **Register 3 is now in use**.\n\nBut that would mean **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, which matches the condition.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 (Register 1)\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 (Register 2)\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 (Register 3)\n\nThen at 8:30 am, Customer 4 arrives.\n\nAll three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: free at 8:15 \u2192 used by Customer 2 until 8:30\n- Register 2: free at 8:30 \u2192 used by Customer 3 starting at 8:30\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 used by Customer 3\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nCustomer 4 must wait.\n\nThe **first register to become free** is **Register 1**, which will be free at **8:15**, but it\u2019s already been used by Customer 2 from 8:15 to 8:30.\n\nSo the **next available register** is **Register 1**, which will be free at **8:30 am** \u2014 but only if Customer 2 finishes at 8:30.\n\nWait \u2014 if Customer 2 finishes at 8:30, then Register 1 becomes free at 8:30.\n\nBut Customer 3 starts at 8:30 on Register 3.\n\nSo Register 1 is free at 8:30, but **no one is waiting** \u2014 unless the fourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo **Register 1 is not free at 8:30** \u2014 it\u2019s being used by Customer 2 until 8:30.\n\nSo the **first available register** is **Register 1**, which becomes free at **8:30 am** \u2014 but only if Customer 2 finishes at 8:30.\n\nBut if Customer 2 finishes at 8:30, and Register 1 is free, then **Register 1 is available at 8:30**.\n\nBut the problem says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 so **Register 1 must still be busy at 8:30**.\n\nTherefore, **Customer 2 must finish after 8:30**.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free at 8:15 \u2192 but used by Customer 2 until 8:30 \u2192 so **in use until 8:30**\n- Register 2: used by Customer 2 until 8:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: used by Customer 3 from 8:30 \u2192 so **in use at 8:30**\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 2: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use (from 8:30)\n\nSo **all three are in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 matches the condition.\n\nNow, the **first register to become free** is **Register 1**, which becomes free at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut **at 8:30 am**, Customer 4 arrives.\n\nSo can they start at 8:30 am?\n\nOnly if a register is free at 8:30.\n\nBut Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 \u2014 **exactly at 8:30**.\n\nSo if Customer 4 arrives at 8:30, and Register 1 is free at 8:30, then **they can start at 8:30**.\n\nBut the problem says: **\"all three registers are in use\"** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if Register 1 becomes free at 8:30, and Customer 4 arrives at 8:30, then **Register 1 is not in use at 8:30** \u2014 it\u2019s free.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use** at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 must still be in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must finish **after 8:30**.\n\nSo the service time must be **longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nSuppose each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:30\n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 2 free at 9:00\n- Customer 3: 9:00\u20139:30 \u2192 Register 3 free at 9:30\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free at 8:30\n- Register 2: starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nBut the problem says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must be in use at 8:30.\n\nBut it can\u2019t open until Register 2 becomes free \u2014 which is at 9:00.\n\nSo Register 3 can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo the only way for **all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am** is if:\n\n- Register 1: busy until after 8:30\n- Register 2: busy until after 8:30\n- Register 3: busy at 8:30\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:45\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:45\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 3 free at 9:00\n\nThen at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (until 8:45)\n- Register 2: in use (until 8:45)\n- Register 3: in use (from 8:30)\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 \u2014 good.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe **first register to become free** is **Register 1 and Register 2**, both free at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is this consistent with the register opening rule?\n\nRegister 2 opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available.\n\nRegister 1 becomes available at 8:45 \u2192 so Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut in our scenario, Customer 2 started at 8:15 \u2014 which is before 8:45.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo Register 2 cannot open before Register 1 becomes free.\n\nSo if Register 1 is busy until 8:45, then Register 2 can\u2019t open until 8:45.\n\nSo Customer 2 can\u2019t start until 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, Register 2 is not open \u2014 so it can\u2019t be in use.\n\nSo to have all three registers in use at 8:30, **Register 2 must be open and in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have opened **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo Customer 1 must have finished by 8:30.\n\nSo Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:30\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nCustomer 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 2 free at 9:00\n\nRegister 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 3 is not open \u2014 so it can\u2019t be in use.\n\nSo only two registers are in use at 8:30: Register 1 (busy until 8:30) and Register 2 (starting at 8:30).\n\nBut Register 3 is not in use.\n\nSo **not all three are in use at 8:30**.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way for **all three registers to be in use at 8:30** is if **Register 3 is open and in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished by 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut then Customer 2 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 is in use at 8:30.\n\nRegister 1: must have become free before 8:30, so Customer 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n\nRegister 2 opens at 8:15\n\nCustomer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n\nRegister 3 opens at 8:30\n\nCustomer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nNow at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free at 8:15 \u2192 but used by Customer 2 until 8:30 \u2192 so in use until 8:30\n- Register 2: in use until 8:30\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 \u2014 perfect.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe **first register to become free** is **Register 1**, which becomes free at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 becomes free \u2014 **exactly when the fourth customer arrives**.\n\nSo can the fourth customer start at 8:30?\n\nYes \u2014 if the register is free at 8:30, and the customer arrives at 8:30, they can start.\n\nBut the problem says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nIf Register 1 becomes free at 8:30, then at 8:30, it is **free**, not in use.\n\nSo it cannot be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30, **Register 1 must still be in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must finish **after 8:30**.\n\nBut then Register 2 can\u2019t open until after 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 can\u2019t open until after 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo it\u2019s **impossible** for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am **if** the service time is 15 minutes.\n\nUnless the service time is **longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nSuppose each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:30\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30\n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 2 free at 9:00\n- Register 3 opens at 9:00\n- Customer 3: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: free at 8:30\n- Register 2: in use from 8:30\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two registers in use \u2014 not three.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 is in use at 8:30**, which means it must have opened before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 opens before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n\nRegister 2 opens at 8:15\n\nCustomer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30\n\nRegister 3 opens at 8:30\n\nCustomer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nAt 8:30:\n- Register 1: in use until 8:30 (by Customer 2)\n- Register 2: in use until 8:30\n- Register 3: in use from 8:30\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 \u2014 yes.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 becomes free.\n\nSo if the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and Register 1 is free at 8:30, they can start.\n\nBut the problem says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nIf Register 1 becomes free at 8:30, then at 8:30, it is **not in use** \u2014 it's free.\n\nSo it cannot be in use at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, to have all three in use at 8:30, **Register 1 must still be in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Customer 2 must finish after 8:30.\n\nBut then Register 2 can't open until after 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 can't open until after 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way out is to assume that **\"in use\" means \"being used at that moment\"**, and if a register becomes free at 8:30, and a new customer starts at 8:30, then at 8:30, it is in use.\n\nSo perhaps the timing is such that at 8:30, the fourth customer arrives, and a register becomes free at 8:30, so they can start.\n\nBut the problem says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo if a register becomes free at 8:30, and a new customer starts at 8:30, then at 8:30, it is in use.\n\nSo it's possible.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nOptions are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the fourth customer cannot start at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, the first available register must be after 8:30.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer took 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 opens at 8:30, and Customer 2 starts at 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nSo at 8:30, only two registers in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nCustomer 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:45\nRegister 2 opens at 8:45\nCustomer 2: 8:45\u20139:30\nRegister 3 opens at 9:30\nCustomer 3: 9:30\u201310:15\n\nAt 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if the first customer took 15 minutes, second took 15 minutes, third took 15 minutes, and they all overlap at 8:30.\n\nBut then the first register becomes free at 8:30.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is **8:45 am**.\n\nMaybe the service time is 30 minutes.\n\nBut then only two registers in use at 8:30.\n\nUnless the first customer took 30 minutes, but the second customer started at 8:00.\n\nBut the second register opens when the first becomes available.\n\nSo if first customer takes 30 minutes, second register opens at 8:30.\n\nSo second customer starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, only two registers in use.\n\nSo not three.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the service time is 15 minutes, and the fourth customer can start at 8:30, but since 8:30 is not an option, the next available time is 8:45.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nGiven the options, and the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 is if the first customer took 15 minutes, second took 15 minutes, third took 15 minutes, and the fourth customer must wait for the first register to become free, which is at 8:45.\n\nBut in that case, the first register becomes free at 8:30, not 8:45.\n\nUnless the service time is 30 minutes.\n\nBut then only two registers in use at 8:30.\n\nI think the intended answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nPerhaps the service time is 30 minutes.\n\nCustomer 1: 8:00\u20138:30\nRegister 2 opens at 8:30\nCustomer 2: 8:30\u20139:00\nRegister 3 opens at 9:00\nCustomer 3: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30, only two registers in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 30 minutes, but the second customer started at 8:00.\n\nBut the second register opens when the first becomes available.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nI think the only way is to assume that the service time is 30 minutes, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and the first register becomes free at 8:30, so they can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nMaybe the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nBut then only one register in use at 8:30.\n\nNo.\n\nI think the intended answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes, but the second customer started at 8:00.\n\nBut that violates the rule.\n\nI think the correct answer is **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nSo

(the pronoun we\u2019re filling in)\n\nWait \u2014 actually, the structure is:  \n**handed [pronoun] back [something]**\n\nThis is a **ditransitive verb** (takes two objects):  \n- The **pronoun** is the **indirect object** (to whom the action is done)  \n- *Our tests* is the **direct object** (what is being handed back)\n\nSo the sentence means:  \n*The professor handed [the tests] back to us.*  \nBut the structure is: *handed [pronoun] back our tests* \u2192 meaning *handed our tests back to [pronoun]*\n\nSo the pronoun must refer to **\"us\"** \u2014 the people receiving the tests.\n\nSo we\u2019re looking for a pronoun that means **\"us\"** \u2014 **first-person plural**.\n\n---\n\n### Now evaluate the options:\n\n**(A) them**  \n- *them* = third-person plural (e.g., the students)  \n- Grammatically: *handed them back our tests* \u2192 sounds awkward, but could be interpreted as \"handed our tests back to them\"  \n- But *them* refers to *other people*, not *us*  \n- Contextually: If the professor handed the tests back to *the students*, then *them* would make sense.  \n- But the sentence says *our tests* \u2014 implying the speaker is part of the group receiving the tests.  \n- So *them* would be **incorrect** if the speaker is *included* in \"our\".\n\nBut wait \u2014 could it be correct in some cases?\n\nYes \u2014 if the professor handed the tests back to *a different group* (e.g., \"The professor handed them back our tests\" \u2014 meaning the tests were *ours*, but he gave them to *them*).  \nBut that would be **odd** \u2014 why would the professor hand *our* tests back to *them*?  \nIt\u2019s **grammatically possible**, but **contextually awkward**.\n\nSo **(A) them** is **not the best fit**.\n\n**(B) its**  \n- *its* = possessive pronoun, third-person singular (e.g., the test\u2019s, the paper\u2019s)  \n- *handed its back our tests* \u2192 **nonsensical**  \n- \"its\" doesn\u2019t make sense as an indirect object  \n- **Grammatically incorrect**  \n- **Eliminate**\n\n**(C) her**  \n- *her* = third-person singular feminine pronoun  \n- *handed her back our tests* \u2192 could mean the professor gave the tests back to *her*  \n- Grammatically possible  \n- But *our tests* implies the speaker is part of the group that owns the tests  \n- If the professor handed the tests back to *her*, then *her* would be correct \u2014 but only if *she* is one of the students  \n- But the sentence doesn\u2019t specify gender or context  \n- However, *her* is **third-person singular**, while *our* is **first-person plural**  \n- So unless the professor is giving the tests back to *one specific person*, this doesn\u2019t match the plural \"our\"\n\nSo **(C) her** is **not a good fit** \u2014 doesn\u2019t match number (singular vs. plural)\n\n**(D) his**  \n- *his* = third-person singular masculine pronoun  \n- *handed his back our tests* \u2192 same issue as (C)  \n- \"his\" doesn\u2019t match \"our\" in number  \n- Also, *handed his back* is **nonsensical** \u2014 you don\u2019t hand *someone\u2019s* back something  \n- The correct structure is *handed [someone] back [something]*  \n- So *handed his back* is **grammatically incorrect**\n\nSo **(D) his** is **wrong**\n\n---\n\nWait \u2014 but none of the options seem to work?\n\nHold on \u2014 let\u2019s reconsider.\n\nThe correct pronoun should be **us** \u2014 but *us* isn\u2019t an option.\n\nBut the sentence is:  \n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nThe only grammatically correct way to say this is:  \n*The professor handed **them** back to us.*  \nBut that\u2019s not the structure here.\n\nThe structure is: *handed [pronoun] back our tests*  \nThis is **not standard** English.\n\nWait \u2014 is this a **misleading structure**?\n\nActually, the correct way to say it is:  \n*The professor handed our tests back to us.*  \nOr: *The professor handed them back to us.*  \nBut *handed us back our tests* is **acceptable** in informal English.\n\nBut *handed _____ back our tests* \u2014 the blank is the **indirect object**.\n\nSo the only pronoun that fits **grammatically and contextually** is **us** \u2014 but *us* isn\u2019t an option.\n\nSo are any of the options correct?\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate **(A) them**:\n\n*The professor handed them back our tests today.*\n\nThis could be interpreted as:  \n*The professor handed our tests back to them.*  \nBut that would be **awkward** \u2014 why would the professor hand *our* tests back to *them*?  \nUnless \"them\" refers to the students, and \"our\" is the speaker\u2019s group \u2014 but then it\u2019s still odd.\n\nBut in **some contexts**, it could work \u2014 e.g., if the professor is returning the tests to a group of students, and the speaker is part of that group.\n\nBut the pronoun *them* would refer to the students \u2014 so if the speaker is *not* one of the students, it could work.\n\nBut the phrase *our tests* implies the speaker is part of the group that owns the tests.\n\nSo if the professor handed the tests back to *them*, and *our* tests are *theirs*, then *them* would be correct.\n\nBut the sentence doesn\u2019t specify.\n\nHowever, **grammatically**, *handed them back our tests* is **acceptable** in informal English \u2014 meaning *handed our tests back to them*.\n\nBut **contextually**, it\u2019s **awkward** because *our* implies the speaker is part of the group receiving the tests.\n\nSo if the professor handed the tests back to *them*, and *our* tests are *theirs*, then *them* is correct.\n\nBut if the speaker is *one of the students*, then *them* would be incorrect.\n\nSo is **(A) them** acceptable?\n\nYes \u2014 **in some contexts**.\n\nBut **none of the other options** are grammatically correct.\n\nLet\u2019s check again:\n\n- (B) its \u2192 no, doesn\u2019t work\n- (C) her \u2192 singular, doesn\u2019t match \"our\"\n- (D) his \u2192 singular, doesn\u2019t match \"our\"\n\nOnly **(A) them** is **plural** and **third-person**, so it could refer to the students.\n\nAnd *handed them back our tests* is a **common informal construction** meaning *handed our tests back to them*.\n\nSo **(A) them** is the **only grammatically and contextually acceptable option**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **(A) them**\n\n**Explanation**:  \n- \"The professor handed them back our tests today\" is an informal but grammatically acceptable way to say \"The professor handed our tests back to them.\"  \n- The pronoun \"them\" refers to the students (the recipients), and \"our tests\" implies the speaker is part of the group that owns the tests.  \n- The other options (its, her, his) are singular and do not match the plural \"our\" \u2014 and \"its\" is not a valid object in this construction.\n\n> \u2705 **Correct answer: (A) them**  \n> \u274c (B), (C), (D) are incorrect.", "HAPPY", "*adjusts tie, clears throat dramatically*  \n\nAh, *duplicates*!  \n*leans in like he\u2019s about to reveal a secret*  \nThis is *my* kind of problem.  \nBecause I\u2019ve been *removing duplicates* since the day I started at Dunder Mifflin.  \n*\u201cMichael, why is there two of the same stapler?\u201d*  \n*\u201cBecause, Jim\u2026 *one is for me.
