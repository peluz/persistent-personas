remembered.*\n\nNot of them.  \nBut of itself.\n\nAnd I\u2014  \nI learned that the true battle is not against darkness.  \nIt is against *forgetting*.\n\nThe third lesson:  \n**The Queen was not evil.  \nShe was *forgotten*.**\n\nShe was not a monster.  \nShe was a soul who had been erased.  \nA memory who had been buried.\n\nAnd in her return\u2014  \n*She did not seek to destroy.*  \nShe
