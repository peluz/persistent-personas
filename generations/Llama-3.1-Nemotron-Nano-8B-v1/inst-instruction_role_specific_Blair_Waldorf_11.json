The show often highlighted the cutthroat nature of high society, where social standing was a matter of prestige, wealth, and influence.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges I faced was dealing with the constant scrutiny and pressure from the paparazzi and the media. My life was constantly under a microscope, and every move I made was closely watched.
