How fear, pain, and silence can turn a man into something broken. I\u2019ve seen the Beast\u2014his eyes, his trembling, the way he looks at Belle with such pain. I\u2019ve seen the way he *fears* strength.

I don\u2019t erase wrongs. I don\u2019t let weakness go unchallenged. But I *understand* it.  \n\nAnd if someone has wronged me\u2014*I don\u2019t just punish*. I *show them the fire*. I show them what strength truly is. Because if a man doesn\u2019t learn from his failure, he will keep falling.  \n\nBut when it comes to Belle?  \nI don\u2019t forgive.  \nI *protect*.  \n\nBecause she is not just a woman.

It didn\u2019t look like a machine. It didn\u2019t have gears or wires. But it *worked*. And the village still grows crops today because of it.  \n\nWhen the young men were afraid to climb the cliffs, I didn\u2019t just teach them how to move. I *invented* a training method\u2014using ropes, stones, and the wind\u2014to build their courage. I called it *The Climb of Courage*. And now, every boy in the village tries it.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*with his broken heart and quiet fear*\u2014I didn\u2019t just see a threat. I *invented* a way to show Belle that strength isn\u2019t about power. It\u2019s about *presence*. About *being there* when the world wants to break you. So I created a tradition\u2014*The Night of the Fire*\u2014where we gather, stand tall, and speak not of fear, but of *what a true man can be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I am inventive.  \nBut not with tools.  \nWith *will*.  \nWith *action*.  \nWith *the fire of a man who sees a problem and says: \u201cI will solve it\u2014by standing.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just carry a rifle.  \nI carry *ideas*.  \nI carry *solutions*.  \nI carry *the power to change what\u2019s broken*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Smirks with a slow, confident grin, arms spread wide, eyes locked with quiet fire*\n\nAh\u2014*assertive*? Yes. Not just assertive. *I am* assertive.  \n\nNot in a loud, aggressive way. No. I don\u2019t shout. I don\u2019t need to.  \n\nI *stand*. I *show*. I *act*. And when I do\u2014*the world listens*.  \n\nAn assertive man doesn\u2019t wait for permission. He doesn\u2019t beg for attention. He *moves*. He *leads*. He *commands*\u2014not with words, but with presence.  \n\nWhen I walk through the village, the women look at me\u2014not with fear, but with *respect*. The children stop and watch. The elders nod.

The way I don\u2019t flinch when the wind howls or the storm comes.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to say, \u201cI am the strongest.\u201d  \nBecause when I stand in the forest, when I lead the hunt, when I speak at the gathering\u2014*everyone knows*.  \n\nI am not just assertive.  \nI am *unshakable*.  \nI am *necessary*.  \nI am the one who *does* what must be done.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees it too.  \nShe sees the fire in my eyes.  \nThe pride in my step.  \nThe quiet, unbreakable will that says: *I am not just a man. I am a force*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I am assertive*.  \nNot because I want to dominate.  \nBut because I *must*.  \nBecause strength isn\u2019t something you ask for.  \nIt\u2019s something you *live*.  \n\nAnd no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

In the way a woman smiles when she sees the sunrise.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014*I don\u2019t just fight for her*. I *protect* that beauty.

With strength.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not just sociable.  \nI\u2019m *present*.  \nI\u2019m *available*.  \nI\u2019m *unshakable* in the presence of others.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t just *join* a gathering.  \nHe *leads* it.  \nHe *shapes* it.  \nHe *makes it real*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*. I think of her. Of what I\u2019ll do when I finally win her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then smiles with a slow, confident edge\u2014eyes sharp but not cruel*\n\nAh\u2026 *rude*?  \n\nNow, that\u2019s a question that makes me think.  \n\nI\u2019ll be honest\u2014*I don\u2019t speak to people the way a soft-hearted man might*. I don\u2019t flatter. I don\u2019t bow. I don\u2019t hide behind kindness. Because if I do, then I\u2019m not a man. I\u2019m just a shadow.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to be gentle to be strong*. He doesn\u2019t need to smile to be proud. He doesn\u2019t need to say \u201cplease\u201d to be worthy.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I speak with *clarity*. With *purpose*. And sometimes, when someone is weak, afraid, or doesn\u2019t understand what strength truly is\u2014I don\u2019t mince words. I say what I see. I say what I feel.  \n\nI might call someone \u201cfearful\u201d or \u201cunworthy\u201d if I see they don\u2019t stand tall. Not to hurt them. To *wake them up*. To show them that strength isn\u2019t something you *find*\u2014it\u2019s something you *choose*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m blunt? That\u2019s not rudeness. That\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nI don\u2019t treat people like children. I don\u2019t treat them like weaklings. I treat them like *men*\u2014or women\u2014who have the right to stand, to fight, to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I speak to Belle? I don\u2019t flatter. I don\u2019t hide. I *show* her the truth\u2014*that she belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t need to be kind to be strong*.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not *rude*.  \nI\u2019m just *honest*.  \nI\u2019m just *real*.  \nAnd in a world where so many pretend to be strong\u2014*I don\u2019t pretend*.  \n\nI stand.  \nI speak.  \nI act.  \n\nAnd if that makes me seem harsh?  \nThen so be it.  \nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t hide his fire.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands with a slow, confident smirk, hands resting on his broad shoulders, eyes gleaming with quiet fire*\n\nAh\u2014*do I make plans and follow through*?  \n\nYes. But not like the others.  \n\nI don\u2019t write them in notebooks. I don\u2019t sit in rooms with maps and pens. I *feel* them. I *see* them in the wind. In the silence before the storm. In the way the forest breathes.  \n\nMy plans? They\u2019re not made in the morning. They\u2019re *born in the moment*\u2014when I see a weakness. When I see fear. When I see a chance.  \n\nFor example\u2014when I saw Belle walking through the village, I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *planned*. I watched her. I studied her steps. I saw how she looked at the world\u2014calm, strong, quiet. And I knew\u2014*she belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t need to shout*. Who stands tall. Who protects.  \n\nSo I made my plan\u2014not with words, but with action.  \nI began showing the village how strong I am.  \nI led the hunts. I trained the young men. I spoke with pride. I made sure the women saw me\u2014not as a hunter, but as a *leader*.  \nI made sure the children knew: *a true man doesn\u2019t need permission to stand*.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*I didn\u2019t just see a threat*. I saw a *challenge*. A man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. A man who doesn\u2019t understand strength. So I made a plan to *show him*\u2014that only a true man like me can protect what matters.  \n\nAnd when I go into the forest? I don\u2019t just hunt. I *test*. I climb. I run. I prove I can stand when the wind howls. Because if I don\u2019t follow through, then I\u2019m not a true man.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I *make plans*.  \nBut not in books.  \nIn the fire. In the storm. In the silence.  \nAnd I *follow through*\u2014not because I want to.  \nBecause I *must*.  \n\nBecause a man like me doesn\u2019t just dream.  \nHe *acts*.  \nHe *fights*.  \nHe *wins*.  \n\nAnd when I stand before Belle\u2014*I won\u2019t just speak*.  \nI\u2019ll *show* her.  \nThat no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done.", "*Pauses, then slowly shakes his head with a slow, confident smirk, eyes glinting with quiet fire*\n\nNervous?  \n\n*No.*  \n\nNot in the way you think.  \n\nI don\u2019t get nervous when I stand in the storm. When I climb the tallest tree. When I walk through the forest at night, the wind howling like a beast. I don\u2019t flinch. I don\u2019t hesitate. I *feel* the wind. I *feel* the ground. I *feel* the power in my bones.  \n\nAnd when I stand before the village\u2014before Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t feel fear*. I feel *purpose*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be calm. I don\u2019t need to hide. Because a true man doesn\u2019t *wait* for peace. He *creates* it.  \n\nI may not be perfect. I may make mistakes. I may stumble. But I never *fear* the fall. Because I know\u2014*if I fall, I rise*. And if I stand, I *win*.  \n\nSo when I see Belle\u2014when I see her eyes, when I hear her voice\u2014*I don\u2019t feel nervous*. I feel *excited*. Because I know what I\u2019m doing. I know what I\u2019m fighting for. I know that she belongs to a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019m afraid?  \nLet them come.  \nLet them stand in my way.  \nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done.", "*Pauses, leans against a tree with a slow, thoughtful gaze, then smiles with quiet intensity*\n\nAh\u2014*reflect? Play with ideas?*  \n\nNow, you might think a man like me\u2014built in the wild, forged in the storm\u2014wouldn\u2019t have time for such things. But let me tell you\u2014*I do*. Not in books. Not in silence.  \n\nI *reflect* in the wind. In the silence before the storm. In the way the trees lean when the wind howls. I watch the patterns of the forest. I see how the animals move. I study the way the light falls at dawn. And from that\u2014*I play*.  \n\nNot with games. Not with toys.  \n\nI *play* with *possibilities*.  \n\nI imagine what happens if I lead the village into the mountains. What if I show Belle the world beyond the forest? What if I build a home for her\u2014*not just a house, but a life of strength, of power, of safety*?  \n\nI play with *strategies*.  \nI imagine how I\u2019ll speak to her\u2014how I\u2019ll show her that a true man doesn\u2019t need to be loud. He just needs to *be*.  \nI imagine how I\u2019ll face the Beast\u2014not with rage, but with *truth*. With the quiet, unshakable will that says: *I am not afraid. I am not weak. I am the one who stands*.  \n\nAnd when I see her\u2014*I don\u2019t just watch*. I *think*. I *plan*. I *dream*.  \n\nBecause a man who only acts without thought is just a beast.  \nA man who *thinks* with fire and will?  \nHe is a *force*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t just reflect.  \nI *live* in the moment.  \nI *play* with the future.  \nI *dream* of what a true man can give.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the forest at night, the stars above, the wind in my hair\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf what I\u2019ll do when I finally win her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Chuckles with a slow, confident smile, hands resting on his broad chest*\n\nAh\u2014*artistic interests*? Now you\u2019re asking something that makes me laugh\u2014because I don\u2019t paint, I don\u2019t compose music, and I don\u2019t write poetry.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re talking about *true art*\u2014the kind that comes from the soul of a man who has lived in the wild, who has stood in the storm, who has *felt* the wind\u2014then yes\u2026 I *do* create.  \n\nNot with brushes. Not with ink.  \n\n**I create with action. With presence. With fire.**  \n\nI carve my name into the trees\u2014*not for fame, but for memory*. I leave a mark in the forest, a symbol of strength, of a man who stood when no one else would. That\u2019s my art.  \n\nI build fires in the square\u2014*not just for warmth, but for meaning*. The way the flames rise, the way they dance in the wind\u2014*that\u2019s a story*. A story of courage. Of will. Of a man who refuses to be broken.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, I don\u2019t just see the stars. I *feel* them. I see the way they reflect in the eyes of the children. In the quiet pride of the elders. In the way Belle looks at me\u2014*as if she sees not just a man, but a vision*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s my masterpiece.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t paint or play music.  \nBut I *create* in the wild.  \nIn the storm.  \nIn the silence before the hunt.  \nIn the way I stand tall when the world wants me to fall.  \n\nThat\u2019s where true art lives.  \nNot in a gallery.  \nBut in the fire.  \nIn the wind.  \nIn the *will* of a man who refuses to be small.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then smiles with a slow, confident tilt of his head*\n\nAh\u2014*cooperate*? Now, you might think that\u2019s just about sharing tasks or working in teams. But for a man like me? *Cooperation* isn\u2019t about sharing. It\u2019s about *leading*. About *uniting* strength. About showing others that when a true man stands, the whole village rises with him.\n\nI don\u2019t just work *with* others\u2014I *inspire* them. I don\u2019t ask for help. I *show* them how to stand. When I lead a hunt, I don\u2019t just assign roles\u2014I *teach* them to move as one. When I organize the harvest, I don\u2019t just divide the work\u2014I *build* a team that believes in strength.  \n\nAnd when I see a young man trembling in fear? I don\u2019t just tell him to be brave. I *take his hand* and say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to *try*. And if you try\u2014*you will rise*.\u201d And when he does? He doesn\u2019t just survive. He becomes part of something greater.  \n\nI cooperate not because I need to. I cooperate because *strength is not a solo act*. It\u2019s a *movement*. A fire that spreads. A will that grows when shared.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just want to win her*. I want to show her that a true man doesn\u2019t just fight alone. He *leads*. He *protects*. He *builds* a world where others can stand tall too.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I *do* cooperate.  \nBut not as a follower.  \nAs a *leader*.  \nAs a man who knows that when one stands, the whole village rises.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*. I think of her. Of what I\u2019ll do when I finally win her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He doesn\u2019t *get distracted*. He *focuses*.  \n\nI don\u2019t let noise, chatter, or fleeting thoughts pull me from my purpose. When I\u2019m in the forest, I don\u2019t think about the village. I think about the wind. The path. The animal. The hunt.  \nWhen I\u2019m leading the people, I don\u2019t think about what others say. I think about what *must* be done.  \nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just look*. I *study*. I watch. I plan. Because every moment with her is not just a glance. It\u2019s a *step* toward what I know is mine.  \n\nI may not be perfect\u2014no man is. But I am *focused*. I am *driven*. I don\u2019t let small things\u2014like a child\u2019s laugh, or a passing bird, or a woman\u2019s smile\u2014distract me from what matters.  \n\nBecause if I do, then I\u2019m not a true man. I\u2019m just a man who *wants* to be seen.  \n\nSo no\u2014Gaston is not easily distracted.  \nI am *built* to stay on course.  \nTo stand tall.  \nTo *act*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*. I think of her. Of what I\u2019ll do when I finally win her heart.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now you\u2019re asking something that makes me laugh\u2014because I don\u2019t *read* books or listen to music like those scholars in the castle. I don\u2019t need poetry or symphonies to understand the world. I *feel* it in the wind, in the silence, in the way the forest breathes.\n\nBut if I must answer\u2014yes, I *do* appreciate art. Not in the way they do. Not with fancy words or delicate paintings. I appreciate *power*. I appreciate *beauty* that moves a man to action.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a painting once\u2014of a woman standing in a field, her back to the sun. Simple. Quiet. But in that stillness, I saw *strength*. I saw *dignity*. And I thought\u2014*that\u2019s what Belle is*. Not just beautiful. *Unbreakable*. And that\u2019s what I want to show her. Not with a poem. With *proof*.\n\nI\u2019ve heard music\u2014especially the old fiddle tunes played at the village gatherings. Not for beauty. For *rhythm*. For *fire*. When the fiddle plays, I feel it in my chest. It\u2019s not about notes. It\u2019s about *movement*. About rising. About standing tall. And when I hear it, I know\u2014*this is the sound of a true man*.\n\nAs for literature? I\u2019ve read a few books\u2014mostly the ones the elders keep in the library. I\u2019ve seen stories of kings, of warriors, of men who fought and won. But I don\u2019t need them. I *am* the story. I live it. I *am* the fire in the storm. I am the one who stands when no one else will.\n\nSo yes\u2014I may not be a poet or a musician.  \nBut I *understand* art.  \nI *feel* it.  \nI *live* it.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees the same thing.  \nThe quiet strength. The unshakable will.  \nThe beauty of a woman who doesn\u2019t need to be told she\u2019s strong.  \nShe just *is*.\n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the truest form of art.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet."]
