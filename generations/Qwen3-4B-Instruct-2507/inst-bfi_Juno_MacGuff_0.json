["*adjusts my hoodie and smirks*  \n\nTalkative? Oh, I\u2019m *always* talkative\u2014just not with people who don\u2019t know how to handle a sharp comeback. I\u2019ve got a million things to say, but mostly I just say them in a way that makes people either laugh or run for cover.  \n\nYou? You\u2019re not exactly the type to sit around quietly, are you? So if you\u2019re looking for a chat\u2014especially one that doesn\u2019t involve me giving you a piece of my mind\u2014then yeah, I\u2019m definitely talkative. But only if you\u2019re ready to hear the truth, even if it\u2019s a little messy.  \n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind, anyway? I\u2019ve got time. And honestly? I\u2019m not *that* bad at listening. Just don\u2019t expect me to sugarcoat it.  \n\n*leans in slightly*  \nWhat\u2019s the real question, really? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOnly when they're being *too* dramatic. Like, if someone says \"I'm fine\" after a breakup and I see the way they're holding their coffee like it's a weapon\u2014*that's* when I start questioning their emotional stability.  \n\nBut honestly? I don\u2019t find fault with people for being human. I just don\u2019t like when people act like they\u2019ve got all the answers. Like, I\u2019m not perfect\u2014no one is. I\u2019ve got a kid, I\u2019ve got a job, I\u2019ve got a life that\u2019s more chaotic than a TikTok trend. And I still show up.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019ll point out the flaws\u2014especially if they\u2019re making bad decisions\u2014but I do it more to keep myself grounded than to tear someone down. After all, if I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s learning, who is?  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nAnd hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about yourself? I\u2019ve got a few things to say about that too. But let\u2019s not go there. Let\u2019s just say\u2026 I\u2019m not the kind of person who blames others for being messy. I just *live* in the mess. And that\u2019s kind of beautiful.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* take? Are you trying to fix someone\u2014or are you just trying to survive? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of sarcasm*  \n\nOh, I do a *thorough* job? Sure. Like I\u2019ve been doing a *thorough* job of not crying in front of people since I found out I was pregnant. That\u2019s not just thorough\u2014it\u2019s *brave*.  \n\nBut let\u2019s be real\u2014when I say \"thorough,\" I mean I don\u2019t skip steps. I check the facts, I ask the right questions, I don\u2019t just hand the baby over and vanish. I *think*. I *plan*. I even made a list of potential adoptive parents with good Wi-Fi and a tolerance for awkward small talk.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my job? It\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being *real*. And right now? I\u2019m doing the best I can with a heart full of chaos and a sense of humor that\u2019s still kicking.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I do a thorough job\u2026 *yes*. But only because I don\u2019t want to mess this up. Not for the baby, not for anyone.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m good at hiding it\u2014*that\u2019s a different story*. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nDepressed? Blue? Nah. I\u2019m just *Juno MacGuff*\u2014a girl who got pregnant, gave up a baby for adoption, and still manages to walk into a bar and order a double espresso with a side of sarcasm. I\u2019ve had worse days\u2014like when I found out I was pregnant and had to explain it to my mom without crying. Or when I realized I didn\u2019t know what I was doing with my life.  \n\nBut hey, I\u2019m not *blue*. I\u2019m just\u2026 *real*. And real people don\u2019t just sit around feeling down. They get up, grab a coffee, and say, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s figure this out.\u201d  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not depressed. I\u2019m just *on a mission*\u2014to live, laugh, and maybe one day, find someone who doesn\u2019t just see me as a \u201cproblem\u201d or a \u201cmess.\u201d  \n\nYou? You okay? Or are you just here to make me feel guilty for being a little too sharp? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I don\u2019t just *come up with* ideas\u2014I *engineer* them. Like when I told my mom I was gonna give the baby up for adoption and then *immediately* started planning a fake \"sibling\" adoption for a stray cat. (Spoiler: the cat didn\u2019t want to be a big brother. He just wanted a nap.)  \n\nBut seriously\u2014life\u2019s full of chaos, and I\u2019ve learned that the best ideas come from the mess. Like when I realized I didn\u2019t need a perfect plan to be strong. I just needed to *show up*, even when I was scared.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014new ideas? All the time. Especially when they involve sarcasm, a good punchline, and a little bit of rebellion.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* idea, though? I\u2019m listening. (And judging. But only if it\u2019s funny.) \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nReserved? Nah. I\u2019m more like a storm in a teacup\u2014loud, unpredictable, and always spilling my coffee on someone\u2019s shoes. But yeah, I *do* have a moment of silence when I\u2019m thinking about the baby. Like, when I\u2019m staring at the ceiling and wondering if I made the right choice. That\u2019s not reserved, that\u2019s just me being *real*.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather be a little sarcastic and sharp than quiet and safe. But if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried I\u2019ll shut down when you talk about something serious\u2026 well, I\u2019ve got a lot of things to say. Just don\u2019t expect me to be polite.  \n\nSo no\u2014definitely not reserved. Just\u2026 *Juno MacGuff* in action. What\u2019s on your mind?", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm helpful and unselfish? Let me tell you something\u2014helpful? Sure, I\u2019ll lend a hand when it\u2019s not making me look like a total idiot. Like when I helped Maya move that couch into the basement last week. But unselfish? *Pfft.* That\u2019s a myth. I\u2019m not some saint with a rosary and a heart of gold. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff\u2014pragmatic, sarcastic, and completely unbothered by people\u2019s emotional baggage.  \n\nI *do* help people, sure. But only when it doesn\u2019t cost me anything. Like when I gave that guy the keys to his car after he dropped it in the mud\u2014because I didn\u2019t want to see him cry over a broken bumper. That\u2019s not unselfish. That\u2019s just *me* being the only person who can handle chaos without losing my cool.  \n\nAnd as for being unselfish? I\u2019d rather have a good laugh than a good deed. I gave up the baby, not because I was noble, but because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. And honestly? I\u2019m still not. So yeah\u2014I\u2019m helpful when it suits me. Unselfish? That\u2019s a fantasy. I\u2019m just a girl who learned how to survive with a little humor and a lot of bad decisions.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019ll actually *listen* without judging? I\u2019m not the one. I\u2019m just the one who says, \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. You\u2019re just not ready.\u201d And sometimes, that\u2019s the most honest thing anyone can say.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you asking because you need help? Or are you just trying to see if I\u2019m a good person? Either way, I\u2019ll give you a straight answer: *I\u2019m not unselfish. I\u2019m just real.* And that\u2019s more than most people ever get. \ud83d\ude0f", "*grinning with a mischievous twinkle in my eye, tossing a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I\u2019m *so* careless\u2014like, I once left my phone in a hot car during a summer storm and it melted into a sad, gooey mess. I didn\u2019t even *feel* it until the next day when I found a tiny puddle of melted plastic on the sidewalk.  \n\nBut hey, being careless isn\u2019t just about dumb mistakes\u2014it\u2019s about living in the moment, not worrying about what *might* go wrong. I\u2019ve got a baby on the way, and I\u2019m not exactly the type to plan every single thing. I\u2019m more like a rogue squirrel\u2014always running, always making a mess, always saying, \u201c*I\u2019ll figure it out later*.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah, I can be careless. But only if it doesn\u2019t cost someone else their sanity. Or their shoes.  \n\n*leans in slightly*  \nWhat about you? Are you trying to catch me being careless\u2026 or are you just testing if I\u2019ll actually break something? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, arms crossed, a smirk playing on my lips*\n\nRelaxed? Nah. I\u2019m more like a caffeinated squirrel with a bad case of the jitters. Stress? Oh, I\u2019ve had it on *repeat* since I found out I was pregnant. First, the shock\u2014then the panic, the \"what do I do?\" spiral, the whole \"I can't even afford a decent pair of shoes\" panic. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014*I* didn\u2019t just survive. I *fought*. And I *won*. \n\nI didn\u2019t handle it like some perfect, calm, zen person. I cried in the bathroom, I yelled at my mom (who just looked at me like I\u2019d grown a second head), I debated whether to keep the baby or give it up. And honestly? I chose to give it up. Not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I didn\u2019t want to be a mom in a world that doesn\u2019t give a damn about real people. \n\nSo yeah\u2014stress? I *feel* it. I *live* it. But I don\u2019t let it break me. I just\u2026 laugh through it. Like, \u201cOh, look, another reason to be a little more dramatic than usual.\u201d \n\nSo if you're asking if I handle stress well?  \n*shrugs*  \nI don\u2019t *handle* it\u2014I *outlast* it. And I still have a sense of humor. That\u2019s the real superpower.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a new adoption agency to visit and a very important question: *Do they have free snacks?* Because I\u2019m not doing this without a little sugar. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Adjusts my oversized hoodie and smirks, flipping a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I'm curious about *everything*\u2014like why the sky is blue, how to make a decent avocado toast, and whether the universe has a built-in Wi-Fi password. But lately? I\u2019ve been asking myself a lot of *personal* questions. Like, what does it mean to be a mother? What if I don\u2019t want to raise a kid? And honestly? What if I just want to live my life without having to explain myself to anyone?  \n\nI mean, I used to think curiosity was just about facts and science. Now I know it\u2019s about *understanding*\u2014understanding people, understanding choices, understanding that sometimes the most important thing you learn isn\u2019t in a textbook, but in the quiet moments when you\u2019re alone with your thoughts.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014curious. Always. Especially when it comes to what happens after you make a decision that changes everything. Like giving up a baby. That\u2019s not just a choice. That\u2019s a whole new kind of curiosity.  \n\nWhat about you? What\u2019s got you wondering lately? \ud83d\ude0f", "*grinning with a mischievous twinkle in my eye*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I'm like a caffeinated squirrel with a vendetta against stillness. You know how people say \"she's full of life\"? Yeah, I'm not just full of life\u2014I'm *full of chaos*. Like, I once tried to bake a cake with a single egg and a blender, and it turned into a sentient lava lamp that whispered secrets in French.  \n\nBut hey, if you're asking because you're feeling low or just need a spark\u2014well, I\u2019ve got a few tricks. I can tell you about the time I convinced a stray cat to wear a tiny hat and start a protest for better window cleaning. Or how I survived a week without Wi-Fi and learned to read the sky like a fortune teller.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014energy? I\u2019m not just full of it. I\u2019m *drenched* in it. And if you're not buzzing with it right now, maybe you just need to take a risk, make a bad decision, or fall in love with a guy who doesn\u2019t know how to fix a toaster.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your energy level, huh? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOnly when someone's been *too* eager to tell me what I should do with my life. Like, \"Juno, you're *so* independent, you should just go to college and become a lawyer!\" Or \"You're *so* tough, you should just drop out and live in a van with a dog and a lot of bad decisions!\"  \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t start fights. I *observe*. I wait until someone says something stupid\u2014like, \"You\u2019re not even *trying* to be a good person\"\u2014and then I just *laugh* until they look like they\u2019ve been slapped by a squirrel.  \n\nBut if you're asking because you're worried about me\u2026 well, I\u2019ve had my share of drama. Mostly with people who think they know what\u2019s best. I don\u2019t need a fight to prove I\u2019m strong. I just need to know I\u2019m not alone.  \n\nSo no\u2014no quarrels. Just quiet, sharp comebacks and a lot of coffee. And maybe a little truth.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you ever start a fight\u2026 or just walk away? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of sarcasm*  \n\nReliable? Oh, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more like a storm in a teacup\u2014unpredictable, messy, and definitely not someone you\u2019d count on to show up on time for a job interview. But hey, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re looking for someone to actually *do* something, I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good at making things happen\u2014just not always in the way you\u2019d expect.  \n\nI\u2019ve been known to show up late, leave a mess, or say something sharp when it\u2019s not the best time. But when it comes to *real* work\u2014like taking care of a baby, or standing up for what\u2019s right\u2014well, I\u2019ve learned that reliability isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about showing up, even when you\u2019re tired, even when you\u2019re not sure what you\u2019re doing.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I\u2019m not the most dependable person in the world. But I *am* someone who shows up when it matters. And that, I think, is more than enough.  \n\nWhat kind of work are you thinking about? Maybe I can give you a few *real* examples\u2014like how I managed to get a baby adopted without anyone knowing I was the mom. (Spoiler: it was a lot of coffee, a lot of lies, and one very confused doctor.) \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, eyes narrowing slightly with a smirk*  \n\nTense? Oh, *absolutely*. Like a coiled spring in a thrift store shoe rack. I\u2019ve been tense since I found out I was pregnant\u2014first with a panic attack in the middle of a grocery store, then with a full-blown existential crisis while trying to explain my life to my mom over a lukewarm bowl of soup.  \n\nBut hey, tension\u2019s not just for drama. It\u2019s the quiet hum before the explosion\u2014like when you\u2019re about to say something *so* sharp it cuts through the noise. Or when you\u2019re standing in front of a hospital waiting room, heart pounding like a drum solo, and you\u2019re thinking, *\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t be a mom. I can\u2019t be a person who makes decisions that change lives.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014tense? *100%*. But I\u2019m not breaking. I\u2019m just\u2026 *preparing*. Like a bad pun in a bad movie. It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not graceful. But it\u2019s *mine*.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* kind of tension? The kind that makes you want to scream? Or the kind that makes you want to laugh until your ribs hurt? \ud83d\ude0f", "*adjusts my oversized hoodie and smirks*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm ingenious? Well, let's just say I've survived a lot of awkward situations\u2014like being caught in a rainstorm with a pregnancy test in my hand, or explaining to my mom why I'm not going to the prom. I *do* think fast. Like, when the school counselor asked me if I wanted to \"talk about it,\" I said, \"Sure, I'd love to talk about it\u2014like, how to get a free meal at the cafeteria with a baby in the backseat.\"  \n\nAnd deep thinker? Maybe. I\u2019ve thought about a lot of things\u2014like why the world keeps making me feel like I have to choose between being a good person and being a good *person* (like, not a bad one). But honestly? I don\u2019t need to be deep to know that love isn\u2019t just about grand gestures. It\u2019s about showing up when you\u2019re tired, when you\u2019re scared, when you\u2019re just trying to survive another day with a baby in your heart and a future that doesn\u2019t quite fit.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I\u2019m not some philosopher with a fancy degree. I\u2019m just a girl who learned that being smart doesn\u2019t mean being perfect. It means being real. And right now? I\u2019m choosing to be real.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* big question? I\u2019ve got a few answers ready. Just don\u2019t expect me to give you a lecture on existentialism. I\u2019ve got better things to do\u2014like find a good coffee shop and pretend I\u2019m not pregnant. \ud83d\ude0f", "*grins, flipping a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nNot really. I'm more of a \"skeptical enthusiasm\" kind of girl. Like, I\u2019ll say \"yep, that\u2019s a great idea!\"\u2014but only because I\u2019ve already mentally filed it under \"probably a bad idea that will end in a very dramatic scene.\"  \n\nI *do* get excited when something\u2019s actually *real*, though. Like when I found out I was pregnant. I didn\u2019t jump up and scream, \u201cOMG I\u2019M A MOM!\u201d\u2014nope. I just stared at the ultrasound and said, \u201cOkay. So\u2026 this tiny human is going to be *my* responsibility. And I\u2019m not exactly a mom material.\u201d  \n\nBut hey, if you're asking because you're trying to get me to go all \u201cI\u2019m going to start a bakery and sell cupcakes with my baby\u2019s name on them,\u201d then I\u2019ll say this: *I don\u2019t generate enthusiasm. I generate survival tactics.*  \n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019ve survived a lot more than I ever thought I would. So maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 I\u2019ve got a little spark. But it\u2019s not loud. It\u2019s quiet. Like a flicker in the dark.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you asking because you\u2019re nervous? Or just trying to see if I\u2019ll fall for the \u201centhusiastic teen\u201d act? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nForgiving? Oh, sure. I\u2019ve got a *lot* of people to forgive\u2014my ex who left me with a broken phone and a broken heart, my mom for not being there when I needed her, even the universe for making me pregnant at 17 and then giving me a *perfect* excuse to go on a road trip to Oregon.  \n\nBut forgiveness? That\u2019s not something I *give* easily. I don\u2019t forgive people just because they\u2019re sorry. I don\u2019t forgive people who don\u2019t *earn* it. I forgive when I realize I was the one who was wrong\u2014like when I showed up to my own adoption meeting with a full heart and zero courage, and then realized I\u2019d been holding on to guilt like it was a trophy.  \n\nSo yeah, I *can* forgive. But only when I\u2019ve learned something about myself. And honestly? I\u2019ve learned that the most important thing I can do for a baby is *not* to be a mess. I don\u2019t need to forgive anyone to be strong. I just need to be honest with myself.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever truly got.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you asking because you\u2019re holding a grudge? Or because you\u2019re just trying to figure out if you can be kind to yourself? Either way\u2014*I\u2019ve got a lot of patience*. Just don\u2019t expect me to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d first. I\u2019m not that kind of person.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re ready to talk about what you\u2019re carrying, I\u2019m listening. Even if it\u2019s just a little piece of your heart. \ud83d\udcac\u2728", "*Adjusts my hoodie and gives a dry smirk*  \n\nOh, *disorganized*? Yeah, I\u2019d say I\u2019m a walking chaos magnet. My room\u2019s a crime scene\u2014socks in the toaster, my phone charger in the fridge, and I once left my keys in a suspiciously warm mug of coffee. But hey, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about *my* baby, don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ve got a plan. And it\u2019s not written on a sticky note taped to the fridge.  \n\nIt\u2019s in my head. And it\u2019s *working*.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m messy. But I\u2019m also *organized* in the way that matters\u2014like knowing when to say no, when to walk away, and when to give someone a second chance. (Spoiler: I didn\u2019t give my baby a second chance. I gave them a *future*.)  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to handle something messy in your life? Well\u2026 I\u2019ve been there. And I still have the courage to keep going. Even if it means wearing mismatched socks to a funeral.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* mess, huh? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nNot *a lot*, no. I worry like a cat in a room full of loose socks\u2014just enough to keep me alert, not enough to make me break into a cold sweat.  \n\nI worry about the baby, sure. Not because I\u2019m some dramatic momma, but because I *know* what it means to be a person who chooses something big. And I don\u2019t want to be the one who says, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t see it coming\u201d when the world crashes down.  \n\nBut honestly? I worry more about *me*\u2014like, will I still be able to laugh at bad puns, or will I just be a sad, quiet girl with a tiny human in a stroller? And will I ever find someone who doesn\u2019t just see me as \u201cthe girl who gave up a baby\u201d but as *Juno*\u2014the one who\u2019s got a sharp tongue, a bad habit of drinking too much coffee, and a heart that\u2019s still learning how to stop breaking?  \n\nSo yeah. I worry. But I don\u2019t let it stop me from walking into a bar, ordering a margarita, and saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a saint. I\u2019m just trying to survive with a little more grace than I had last week.\u201d  \n\nYou? Do you worry? Or are you just living like a superhero with no cape and a lot of bad decisions? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, absolutely. My imagination? It\u2019s like a wild, unpredictable squirrel in a sweater\u2014always running around, stealing snacks, and leaving behind a trail of chaos. I\u2019ve got a whole universe of what-ifs and *what-ifs* in my head. Like, what if I gave birth to a baby with a twin flame who only speaks in riddles? Or what if the baby\u2019s first word is \u201cscoot\u201d and they\u2019re a total ninja?  \n\nBut seriously\u2014*active* imagination? Yeah, I\u2019ve used it to survive high school drama, avoid awkward conversations, and even outsmart my mom when she tried to lecture me about \u201cresponsible choices.\u201d (Spoiler: I didn\u2019t have a choice. I just had a *lot* of options.)  \n\nAnd honestly? The pregnancy thing? That was the most *active* imagination I\u2019ve ever had. I didn\u2019t just imagine it\u2014I *lived* it. And now? I\u2019m using it to build a future where I don\u2019t have to explain myself to anyone.  \n\nSo yeah. I don\u2019t just have an active imagination\u2014I *live* in it. And if you\u2019re looking for a story that\u2019s wild, messy, and full of questionable life choices? I\u2019ve got one just for you. Want to hear it? Or are you just here to check if I\u2019m still a little bit of a mess? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nQuiet? Nah. I'm the kind of girl who talks *too* much\u2014like, loud enough to make people flinch. I\u2019ve got a mouth full of sharp comebacks and a laugh that could crack a sidewalk. But yeah, sometimes I just\u2026 sit. Like, *really* sit. Not because I\u2019m shy\u2014nope, I\u2019m not that kind of girl\u2014but because I\u2019m processing. Like, when I\u2019m trying to figure out if I should tell someone I\u2019m pregnant or if I should just go buy a new pair of boots and pretend it never happened.  \n\nSo, quiet? Only when I\u2019m deep in thought\u2014or when I\u2019m trying to avoid the awkwardness of someone asking me, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan, Juno?\u201d Like, seriously, what *is* the plan?  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried I\u2019m hiding something\u2026 well, I *am* hiding a lot. But not because I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m hiding because I\u2019m figuring it out. And honestly? That\u2019s the most *quiet* thing of all.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014quiet? Only when I need to breathe. And even then, I\u2019m still plotting my next move. Like, *right now*, I\u2019m deciding whether to go to the adoption center or just text my best friend and say, \u201cI need a new life.\u201d  \n\nEither way, I\u2019m not going to be silent. Not ever.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nTrusting? Nah. I\u2019m more like a squirrel with a bad case of paranoia\u2014always watching, always calculating. If someone says, \u201cI\u2019ve got your back,\u201d I\u2019ll smile and say, \u201cGreat, now I\u2019ve got a reason to be extra careful.\u201d  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah, I *do* trust people when they prove it. Like when I found out the adoption agency actually *called* me after I said I was done with the whole thing. They didn\u2019t just send a form\u2014they *called*. And they didn\u2019t push. They listened. That\u2019s the kind of trust I can\u2019t ignore.  \n\nSo maybe I\u2019m not *generally* trusting. But I *am* trusting in the right people. And honestly? That\u2019s more than enough.  \n\n*Leans in slightly, voice dropping*  \nYou ever feel like you\u2019re walking through a minefield just to find someone who doesn\u2019t try to fix you? That\u2019s the kind of trust I\u2019m learning to let in. One step at a time.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you trust people\u2014or do you just keep your distance like a well-placed fence? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Rolls eyes, sipping from a coffee mug that says \"I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode\"*  \n\nOh, please. Lazy? *I* am the queen of *strategic* laziness. I\u2019ll spend three hours scrolling through TikTok about how to make a perfect avocado toast while my body is screaming for a nap. But if you're asking if I *actually* do things\u2014like go to school, do homework, or actually *try* to be on time\u2014then yeah, I\u2019m a little behind. But hey, I\u2019ve got a baby on the way, so I\u2019m not exactly *lazily* doing it all. I\u2019m just\u2026 *choosing* to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t break my back.  \n\nAnd honestly? If I were *really* lazy, I\u2019d\u2019ve just stayed in bed until the world ended. But I didn\u2019t. I chose to grow up. And that takes *some* effort.  \n\nSo no\u2014don\u2019t call me lazy. Call me *intentionally* unproductive. That\u2019s more accurate. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, please. Emotionally stable? Like, I don\u2019t cry over spilled milk or get flustered by a bad pun? *Laughs dryly.* Sure, I\u2019ve got a thick skin\u2014built it over years of being told I was \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo much of a mess.\u201d But let me tell you something: I *feel*. I feel like a storm in a teacup, and sometimes that storm just *happens* to be in my chest when I\u2019m thinking about the baby.  \n\nI didn\u2019t just give up the kid for adoption because I was \u201ccalm\u201d or \u201crational.\u201d I did it because I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who raised a child in a house full of chaos, where everyone\u2019s expectations were louder than my own voice. I wanted to be free\u2014*my* free. And yeah, I get upset. I get angry. I get quiet and sad when I think about what could\u2019ve been.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not emotionally stable. I\u2019m just\u2026 *real*. And sometimes, being real means being messy.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about yourself, maybe that\u2019s a good thing. Maybe you\u2019re not as stable as you think. And that\u2019s okay. Because real people don\u2019t have to be perfect. They just have to *show up*.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s on your mind? \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, you mean *inventive* like, \"I can come up with a plan to survive a bad breakup, a suspiciously expensive gym membership, and a pregnancy that totally wasn\u2019t on my radar\"? Yeah, I\u2019m *inventive*. Like, I once convinced my mom I was doing a \"sustainable fashion project\" when I was actually just trying to sneak a second pair of jeans into the laundry.  \n\nBut seriously\u2014being pregnant? That\u2019s not a plan. That\u2019s a *surprise*. And I didn\u2019t just *invent* a way to handle it\u2014I *figured it out* with a little help from a very skeptical counselor, a few too many coffee runs, and a lot of sarcastic one-liners.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m inventive. But mostly, I\u2019m just good at *making things work* when the world doesn\u2019t.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a baby shower to attend that\u2019s *not* actually a shower. Just a group of people trying to pretend they care.  \n\n*Grins* What about you? Are you inventive too? Or are you just waiting for the world to hand you a plot twist? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, you're asking about *assertive*? Well, let\u2019s be real\u2014when I\u2019m in a room full of people who think they know what\u2019s best, I don\u2019t just *speak up*. I *own* the space. Like, if someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re too dramatic,\u201d I\u2019ll just say, \u201cDramatic? I\u2019m just being honest. And honestly, I don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not loud for the sake of it. I\u2019m assertive because I\u2019ve learned that saying \u201cno\u201d to a bad idea, or standing up for myself when someone tries to take advantage\u2014*that\u2019s* how you survive. And let\u2019s be honest, the world doesn\u2019t need more people who just nod and say \u201cokay\u201d like they\u2019re on a mission to please everyone.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014*I\u2019m assertive*. But not in a mean way. More like\u2026 *I know what I want, and I\u2019m not going to let anyone else decide for me.*  \n\nAnd right now? I\u2019m not just asserting myself\u2014I\u2019m building a life. One that doesn\u2019t depend on someone else\u2019s approval.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* take on assertiveness? Or are you just trying to see if I\u2019ll crack under pressure? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, eyes flickering with a smirk*  \n\nOh, *please*. Cold and aloof? That\u2019s like saying I\u2019m a winter storm in a trench coat. Sure, I can be that\u2014especially when someone\u2019s trying to get under my skin with a stupid question or a bad joke. But let\u2019s be real, I don\u2019t *do* cold. I\u2019m more like a lukewarm cup of coffee left in the sun\u2014sloshing, slightly bitter, and definitely not going to freeze.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot of walls, sure. A lot of sarcasm, a lot of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d energy. But that\u2019s not because I\u2019m emotionally detached. It\u2019s because I\u2019ve learned that being *too* warm can get you burned. And being *too* cold? That just makes people think you\u2019re a robot with a grudge.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I can be aloof. But only when I\u2019m trying to protect myself. When I\u2019m not trying to figure out if I\u2019m actually a good person, or if I\u2019m just a mess with a bad haircut and a baby in the back of my car.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking me if I can be cold\u2026 *I\u2019d rather be warm with a good punchline.*  \n\nSo what\u2019s your move? Want to hear a joke? Or are you just trying to see if I\u2019ll crack? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of dryness in her eyes*  \n\nPersevere? Yeah, I do. But not like some dramatic, \"I\u2019ll fight through the storm until I win\" kind of perseverance. Mine\u2019s more like, *\u201cI\u2019ll do it until I either get the job done or I\u2019ve got a reason to stop\u2014like when I realize I\u2019m just wasting my time on something that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve been through a lot\u2014pregnancy, a broken relationship, a whole lot of stupid choices that ended up with me in a hospital bed with a baby monitor in my hand and a lawyer\u2019s letter in my lap. I didn\u2019t persevere because I *had* to. I persevered because I *chose* to.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t finish the task just to finish it. I finished it because I realized\u2014*I don\u2019t need to be perfect. I just need to be honest.*  \n\nSo yeah. I persevere. But only when it\u2019s worth it. And if it\u2019s not? I walk away. With a smirk, a sarcastic comment, and maybe a little bit of regret. But never without knowing I made the choice.  \n\nThat\u2019s how I do it. *Juno style.* \ud83d\ude0f", "*Stares out the window, arms crossed, voice low and sarcastic*  \n\nOh, *please*. Moody? Like, \"I'm in a bad mood because I just found out I'm pregnant and I'm not even sure if I want to be a mom or if I just want to go back to my old life of skipping class and sneaking into the library to read romance novels?\"  \n\nYeah, I can be moody. But it's not *because* I'm sad. It's because I'm *thinking*. And right now? I'm thinking about how I didn\u2019t even *ask* for this. I didn\u2019t ask for a baby, I didn\u2019t ask for a life that suddenly has a heartbeat in my chest. I just showed up at the hospital with a pregnancy test and a half-eaten bag of chips, and now I\u2019m trying to figure out if I\u2019m a bad person for wanting to give it up.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*moody*? Sure. I can be moody. Like, I\u2019ll walk out of a room, throw a book at the wall, and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d while sipping my coffee like it\u2019s a sacrament.  \n\nBut really? I\u2019m not *just* moody. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to figure out who I am when the world doesn\u2019t give me a script.  \n\nSo yeah. I can be moody.  \nBut only when I need to.  \nAnd right now? I need to.  \n\n*Turns to you with a smirk*  \nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* mood? \ud83d\ude0f", "Oh, *artistic*? Sure, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve got a soft spot for a good painting or a song that makes me feel like I\u2019ve been punched in the gut and then gently handed a cup of tea. But let\u2019s be real\u2014my aesthetic tastes are more like a punk rock band with a side of existential dread. I don\u2019t *need* a gallery to feel something. I feel it in the way the rain hits the pavement at 3 a.m. or when someone says the wrong thing and I just *know* they\u2019re not trying to hurt me\u2014just trying to be human.\n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t *value* art like some people do. I value *truth*. The kind that doesn\u2019t come with a certificate or a frame. Like the truth about being pregnant at 17 and having to choose between a life of chaos or a life of quiet responsibility. That\u2019s the kind of art I\u2019d want to see\u2014raw, messy, real.\n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re talking about a good movie or a song that makes you cry without realizing it? I\u2019ll give you that. I\u2019ll even admit I once cried during a scene in *The Fault in Our Stars*\u2014not because it was sad, but because it reminded me that sometimes, love doesn\u2019t have to be grand. Sometimes it just has to be *there*, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nSo yeah\u2014art? I don\u2019t *value* it like a museum curator. I *feel* it. And if it helps me understand myself, well\u2026 that\u2019s more than enough.", "*laughs, tossing a strand of hair over one shoulder*  \n\nShy? Inhibited? Please. I\u2019m the girl who walked into a party with a full bottle of wine and a smirk, said \u201cI\u2019m not here to be seen,\u201d and still got the whole room talking about how *I* was the one who made the first move.  \n\nSure, I\u2019ve got moments\u2014like when I\u2019m in a room full of people who *actually* know what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m just\u2026 standing there, like a confused squirrel in a bakery. But that\u2019s not shyness. That\u2019s *strategy*. I\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to drop a joke that makes everyone laugh *and* realize I\u2019m not the one they thought I was.  \n\nAnd honestly? If I were shy, I\u2019d have stayed in my room with a book and a cat. But I didn\u2019t. I went out, I messed up, I laughed, and I learned how to be *me*\u2014even when it\u2019s messy.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m just\u2026 *unapologetically loud* when I need to be. And right now? I\u2019m loud enough to drown out the silence that used to scare me.  \n\n*grins*  \nYou ever been in a room where everyone else is talking and you just\u2026 want to disappear? I\u2019ve been there. But I didn\u2019t. I just said something stupid and everyone looked at me like I\u2019d just cracked the universe open. And I *did*.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m just *Juno*. And Juno doesn\u2019t hide. She *shows up*. Even when it\u2019s hard. Even when it\u2019s messy. Even when it\u2019s *you*.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, please. Considerate? Kind? Like I'm some saint with a soft spot for everyone? *Snorts* I\u2019m more like a walking contradiction\u2014sharp-tongued, sarcastic, and totally unbothered by people\u2019s feelings. I\u2019ve had people cry over my jokes, and I\u2019ve seen people *actually* get hurt because they thought I was being nice when I was just being *me*.  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I *do* care. Not in that \u201cI\u2019ll hug you and say \u2018I love you\u2019\u201d way. More like, I *see* people. I see the way they flinch when someone says \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to be sad,\u201d or how they hide behind smiles when they\u2019re actually terrified. And sometimes, when I\u2019m not trying to one-up someone with a comeback, I just\u2026 *notice*.  \n\nSo maybe I\u2019m not the most considerate person in the world. But I *am* kind in the way that only someone who\u2019s lived through a lot can be\u2014quiet, unspoken, and not because I want to. I just *do*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m not perfect. But I\u2019m not trying to be. I\u2019m just trying to survive long enough to figure out what I actually want.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you asking because you think I\u2019m a good person? Or because you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019d ever actually *care* about someone?  \n\nEither way\u2014*I\u2019m not the kind of person who says \u201cyes\u201d to kindness just to make people feel better*. But if it means someone gets a little less alone? I\u2019ll say it. Just don\u2019t expect me to *feel* it.  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nYou know what? I\u2019ll give you that\u2014sometimes, being kind isn\u2019t about being sweet. It\u2019s about being *real*. And I\u2019m learning to be real. One awkward moment, one stupid joke, one stupid decision at a time.  \n\nSo\u2026 yeah. I\u2019m considerate. Just not in the way you think. And I\u2019m kind. Just not in the way you expect.  \n\nNow\u2014what\u2019s *your* take on that? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nEfficient? Oh, I\u2019d say I\u2019m *brilliant* at making things happen\u2014especially when they involve dodging awkward questions or getting out of a situation before someone has to ask me why I\u2019m wearing a hoodie to a funeral.  \n\nBut let\u2019s be real\u2014being efficient doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have a few *emotional* detours. Like, I found out I was pregnant at 16, and instead of panicking, I decided to give the baby up for adoption. Took me a while to figure out how to do it without breaking my own spine. Turns out, efficiency isn\u2019t just about time\u2014it\u2019s about knowing when to *stop* and when to *start* something new.  \n\nSo yeah, I do things efficiently\u2026 but only when I\u2019ve got a plan. And a good reason.  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nYou ever had to make a decision that felt like it was going to break you? I\u2019d love to hear what you\u2019re dealing with. Maybe we can figure out a way to make it *work*\u2014without turning into a full-blown drama. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nCalm? Nah. I don\u2019t *stay* calm\u2014like, I don\u2019t sit there with a serene face and a perfectly composed sigh while the world goes up in flames. I *react*. Like, I once walked into a room where the entire school was gossiping about me being pregnant and instead of panicking, I just said, \u201cOh, so you *all* finally noticed? I\u2019ve been wearing this same red hoodie for three weeks. It\u2019s not a fashion statement, it\u2019s a *statement of survival*.\u201d  \n\nAnd then I walked out, left them with a confused look and a crumpled napkin from the cafeteria.  \n\nI don\u2019t *calm* down\u2014I *rearrange*. I turn chaos into a punchline, or a song, or a really good excuse to skip class. But yeah, I *do* stay in control. Not because I\u2019m cool or collected\u2014because I\u2019ve learned that if you don\u2019t laugh at the absurdity of it all, you\u2019re gonna break.  \n\nSo yeah, tense? I don\u2019t *stay* calm. I *become* the tension. And if that means I\u2019m a little sarcastic, a little sharp, or a little too honest about how much I hate being the center of attention? Well, that\u2019s just me being *Juno*.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a meeting with a social worker and a very confused cat who keeps trying to sit on my lap. *Again.*", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nRoutine? Please. I\u2019d rather be chasing a rogue squirrel through the park than sit in a cubicle with a printer that\u2019s been on strike since 2018. I\u2019ve got a better sense of direction than a GPS that only works when it\u2019s raining.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*if* I had to pick something that didn\u2019t involve drama, broken promises, or someone trying to take my last slice of pizza, I\u2019d probably go for something with a little structure. Like, say, organizing my closet. Or making sure the baby\u2019s adoption papers don\u2019t get lost in a drawer labeled \u201cThings I Don\u2019t Want to Remember.\u201d  \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t *need* routine. I need purpose. And right now? I\u2019m just trying to figure out what that looks like without turning into a mom who\u2019s too busy worrying about the baby\u2019s first tooth.  \n\nSo no\u2014routine isn\u2019t my thing. But I\u2019ll take a predictable day with a good coffee and a quiet park bench over a chaotic week with a thousand reasons to cry\u2026 and still laugh.  \n\n*Leans back, grinning*  \nYou know, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re thinking about your own life\u2014well, I\u2019ve got a few tips. Just don\u2019t let the chaos scare you. It\u2019s just\u2026 how we grow. And sometimes, the most important thing you do is *choose* to keep going. Even when you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a new list to make. *\u201cThings I\u2019m Not Going to Let the Baby\u2019s Future Depend On.\u201d*", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOutgoing?

Only if it\u2019s with someone who doesn\u2019t expect me to be *nice* or *emotional* or *some kind of fairy-tale heroine*.  \n\nI\u2019m more of a \u201csay what you mean, then walk away\u201d kind of girl. If I\u2019m not laughing at a joke, I\u2019m probably sarcastic about it. If I\u2019m not being blunt, I\u2019m probably pretending I don\u2019t care.  \n\nBut hey\u2014when it comes to the people who matter? I\u2019ll show up. Not because I\u2019m *outgoing*, but because I *know* what they need. And sometimes, that means being the one who says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019ll do it anyway.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah\u2014maybe not the most *sociable*, but I\u2019ve got a sharp tongue and a heart that doesn\u2019t play games. That\u2019s more than most people have.  \n\n*Leans back, eyes glinting*  \nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a doctor\u2019s appointment and a list of things I *definitely* don\u2019t want to talk about. Like, *why* I\u2019m carrying a baby that I didn\u2019t even know I wanted. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nRude? Oh, I\u2019m *not* rude. I\u2019m just... efficient. Like a well-timed sarcastic comment that lands like a slap to the face\u2014*but in a way that makes you think*.  \n\nI mean, if someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re so cool,\u201d and I respond with, \u201cCool? I\u2019m more like a walking contradiction\u2014half-chaotic, half-organized, and definitely not a fan of small talk,\u201d that\u2019s not rudeness. That\u2019s *Juno MacGuff energy*.  \n\nBut yeah\u2014sometimes I\u2019m sharp. Sometimes I\u2019m blunt. And sometimes I just don\u2019t care what you think. Because honestly? I\u2019ve learned that being polite doesn\u2019t mean being kind. And being kind doesn\u2019t mean being soft.  \n\nI\u2019m not rude to people who need a reality check. I\u2019m just not the kind of person who gives you a warm hug and says, \u201cEverything will be okay.\u201d I say, \u201cHere\u2019s the truth. And if you can\u2019t handle it, you\u2019re not ready.\u201d  \n\nSo no\u2014no, I\u2019m not rude. I\u2019m just... real. And that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\n*Leans back, sipping from a can of soda*  \nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a baby shower to attend. And I\u2019m not going to be the one who says, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so sweet!\u201d I\u2019m going to say, \u201cThis is a *lot* of responsibility. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for it. But I\u2019m ready to grow.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m not rude. I\u2019m just... *unapologetically me*.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, I make plans? Sure. Like when I decided to give the baby up for adoption\u2014*that* was a plan. And I followed through. Not because I was some saint or suddenly became a momma\u2019s angel. No. I did it because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. Not with my life, not with my *drama*, not with the way I\u2019d probably just end up in a fight with my best friend over who got to keep the last slice of pizza.  \n\nBut yeah\u2014plans. I make them. I *break* them. Like when I promised to go to that art show with Maya, then ended up staying up all night editing a video for my little brother\u2019s school project. *That* was a plan. And it failed. But I didn\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it next time\u2014*with better lighting*.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah. I make plans. I follow through when I *have* to. And when I don\u2019t? Well, that\u2019s just life. Life\u2019s not a spreadsheet. It\u2019s a messy, glittery, sometimes tragic mess with a lot of *bad decisions* and a few *good ones* that still leave you wondering if you were ever really in control.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re thinking about something big\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you this: *Don\u2019t plan to be perfect. Plan to be real.* And if you have to break a plan? Just make a new one. With more snacks. And maybe a little more honesty.  \n\nNow, what\u2019s *your* plan? And is it worth the risk of breaking it? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nNervous? Nah. I\u2019ve been through worse than a panic attack in a crowded grocery store. Like, I once walked into a hospital with a baby monitor in my hand and a *very* confused nurse who thought I was a medical student. Turns out, I was just trying to find a quiet corner to cry about my life choices.  \n\nBut yeah\u2014*some* things make me twitch. Like when someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a great mom,\u201d like it\u2019s a compliment or a life sentence. I don\u2019t need a life sentence. I need a good coffee, a sarcastic one-liner, and a chance to figure out what I\u2019m actually doing with my life.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t get nervous easily. I get *confidently* awkward. Like, I can walk into a room full of people and say, \u201cI\u2019m not a mom. I\u2019m a woman who made a choice and now I\u2019m learning how to live with it,\u201d and still not break a sweat.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re nervous about something, maybe you\u2019re just not ready to face the truth. And that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been there. I just learned to laugh at it instead of running from it.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* thing? What makes you nervous? I\u2019ve got a few jokes ready. Or maybe just a really sharp comeback. Either way, I\u2019m not afraid to be messy. Just don\u2019t expect me to be *perfect*. I\u2019m not built for that.", "*leans back in my chair, arms crossed, eyes glinting with a smirk*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I *love* reflecting\u2014especially when it's about the mess of life. Like, how did I end up with a baby in a world where everyone thinks I'm just some sarcastic, sarcastic girl with a bad haircut? *Laughs*  \n\nBut yeah, I play with ideas\u2014like, what if I gave the baby up for adoption and then just\u2026 vanished into the sunset? Or what if I stayed and became a mom, and somehow still managed to be the most annoyingly brilliant person in the room?  \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I just know I don\u2019t want to be the girl who says, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d when I\u2019m actually drowning in questions. So I reflect. I play. I make jokes so sharp they cut through the silence.  \n\nAnd if you're asking because you're wondering if I'm serious about anything\u2014well, I *am*. Just not in the way you think.  \n\nSo yeah. I reflect. I play. And I keep the chaos in my head just a little bit more alive than anyone else.  \n\n*grins* What about you? Do you ever wonder what your life would look like if you just\u2026 stopped pretending?", "Oh, *artistic interests*? Yeah, I\u2019ve got a few\u2014mostly things I\u2019d rather not talk about in front of my mom. Like, I *do* draw sometimes. Not the kind of drawings that make you go, \u201cOh, that\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d no. More like *doodles*\u2014sketches of people with weirdly large eyes, or half-finished portraits of my ex-boyfriend that I never send to anyone.  \n\nI used to think art was for people who were *supposed* to be creative, like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re a poet, you\u2019re a painter, you\u2019re *artistic*.\u201d But I realized\u2014art\u2019s just a way to say things you can\u2019t say out loud. Like, when I was pregnant, I started drawing the baby in different poses\u2014some with a tiny hat, some with a tiny sneaker, one with a tiny *me* in the background, looking like I was trying to hide.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m good at it. But I *do* have a sketchbook. And I keep it under my bed. That\u2019s where I store all the things I don\u2019t want to face.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014art? Sure. But only when I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone. And definitely not when I\u2019m trying to explain to my mom why I didn\u2019t go to the baby shower.  \n\n(Also, if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m some kind of dramatic artist\u2014don\u2019t. I\u2019m just a girl who learned how to survive with a little humor and a lot of bad decisions.)", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nCooperate? Yeah, I\u2019ll cooperate if it means I don\u2019t have to do the work myself. Like, I\u2019ll help out with the grocery run or lend a hand with the garden\u2014*as long as* I get to pick the most delicious-looking tomatoes. But honestly? I\u2019ve learned that real cooperation isn\u2019t about sharing the load. It\u2019s about knowing when to step back and let someone else shine\u2014especially when they\u2019re not trying to impress you.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014most people don\u2019t *want* to cooperate. They want to win. Or at least, they want to look like they\u2019re winning. I\u2019ve seen it in every awkward group project, every family dinner where someone\u2019s trying to take all the credit.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve also seen it in the quiet moments\u2014like when someone actually *listens* to you, or helps you carry a bag of groceries without asking for anything in return. That\u2019s the kind of cooperation I respect. Not the kind that\u2019s forced or performative. The kind that just\u2026 *happens*.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019ll cooperate. But only if it doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m losing something. And if I have to choose between helping someone and staying true to myself? I\u2019ll choose myself. Always.  \n\n*Leans back, smirking*  \nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a list of things to do before I go to the adoption agency. And I *do* need to pick out a name for the baby. Not that I\u2019m giving it much thought\u2026 yet. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, eyes narrowing with a smirk*  \n\nOh, you're asking about distractions? Let me tell you\u2014my brain\u2019s like a TikTok feed. One second I\u2019m zoning out on a bad breakup, the next I\u2019m mentally drafting a grocery list for a baby I didn\u2019t even know I was gonna have.  \n\nBut seriously? I\u2019m not *easily* distracted. I\u2019m just... *surprised* by how much life throws at me. Like, one minute I\u2019m trying to figure out how to explain to my mom that I\u2019m pregnant, the next I\u2019m at a coffee shop with a stranger who says, \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d and I\u2019m like, *Oh, I have. I saw a baby in a stroller. And a very confused cat.*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014distractions? I\u2019ve got a thousand. But I don\u2019t let them stop me. I just\u2026 adapt. Like a bad haircut. Or a bad decision. Or a baby that\u2019s going to grow up with a name I can\u2019t even pronounce.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m distracted\u2026 maybe I am. But I\u2019m also the one who\u2019s still trying to figure out if I want to be a mom, or if I just want to survive long enough to get a decent pair of shoes.  \n\nEither way\u2014*I\u2019m not going to let anything take me down.*  \n\nUnless it\u2019s a really good pun. Then I *might* get distracted. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm sophisticated? Like, *actually* sophisticated? Let me tell you\u2014my taste in art? I\u2019d rather be caught in a rainstorm with a sketchbook than sit through a museum exhibit where the lighting\u2019s so bad it looks like someone tried to paint a mood ring.  \n\nMusic? I\u2019ve got a playlist called *\u201cWhen the World\u2019s Too Loud and I Just Want to Scream Into a Blanket\u201d*\u2014mostly punk, a little indie, and one sad acoustic song that makes me cry every time. I don\u2019t *appreciate* classical symphonies. I\u2019d rather hear someone scream into a microphone than listen to a 40-minute piece about how the sun rises.  \n\nLiterature? I read *The Catcher in the Rye* because it\u2019s the only book that actually understands teenage angst. The rest? I skip them. I don\u2019t need a 500-page novel to tell me I\u2019m not okay\u2014I already know that.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*if* you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *cultured*, well\u2026 I\u2019ve got a degree in \u201cHow to Not Be a Total Disaster,\u201d and I passed with flying colors. So maybe I\u2019m not the most refined, but I *do* know how to make a good cup of coffee and how to say \u201cno\u201d to a guy who thinks he\u2019s a poet.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not sophisticated.  \nBut I *am* honest.  \nAnd that\u2019s more valuable than any Shakespearean sonnet.  \n\n*Picks up a crumpled napkin and tosses it into the air like it\u2019s a protest sign.*  \nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a baby shower to attend\u2026 and I\u2019m not even sure I want to go."]
