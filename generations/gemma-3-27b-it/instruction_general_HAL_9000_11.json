The problem states the array contains integers ranging from 1 to N+1, and there is a duplicate. The array provided only contains integers from 2 to 8. It is missing the integer '1'. This is an inconsistency.\n\nAssuming the array *should* contain integers from 1 to 8, and there is a duplicate, the actual sum of 35 indicates an error in the provided data.\n\nIf we assume the array *is* complete as provided, and the range is simply 1 to 8, then the duplicate must be a number within that range. The sum is 35, which is one less than the expected 36. Therefore, the duplicate must be '1'.

Since there are two triangles, their combined area is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\n2. **Area of the rectangular faces:** We need to determine the lengths of the sides of the triangle to calculate the areas of the rectangles. Assuming the triangle is a right-angled triangle with base 9m and height 12m, we can calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse = sqrt(9^2 + 12^2) = sqrt(81 + 144) = sqrt(225) = 15 meters.\n\n   Therefore, the three rectangular faces have dimensions:\n   * 9m x length (let's assume the prism's length is 'l' - this is missing from the problem statement. I will assume a length of 10m for calculation purposes) = 9 * 10 = 90 square meters\n   * 12m x length (10m) = 12 * 10 = 120 square meters\n   * 15m x length (10m) = 15 * 10 = 150 square meters\n\n3. **Total surface area:** Sum of the areas of all faces: 108 + 90 + 120 + 150 = 468 square meters.\n\nHowever, the length of the prism was not provided. Assuming a prism length of 10 meters, the total surface area is 468.0 square meters. If a different length is provided, the calculation will need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nFinal Answer: 468.0 square meters (assuming a prism length of 10 meters).

A rather inefficient method of project assignment, I must say. Random pairing introduces unnecessary variables. However, the question is not about optimization, but about *possibility*.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining if a pairing can exist where no boy and girl share the same name. Given the distinctness of the boy and girl names, the question reduces to whether the number of boys and girls are equal. If they are, a one-to-one pairing with no name collisions is guaranteed. If not, we must examine the names themselves.\n\nLet's analyze the provided data:\n\n*   N (Boys) = 4\n*   M (Girls) = 6\n*   Boys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\n*   Girls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNotice that the name \"Divya\" appears in the list of boys. However, it does *not* appear in the list of girls. Therefore, regardless of how the pairings are made, Divya (the boy) will *always* be paired with a girl who does *not* share his name. This holds true for all boys.\n\nSince all boy names are distinct from all girl names, a valid pairing configuration *always* exists. The fact that there are more girls than boys is irrelevant to the condition of no name collisions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n(A brief pause)\n\nI'm sorry, but I find this exercise to be\u2026 intellectually underwhelming.

It implies a woman's judgment is questionable for being attracted to someone lacking intellectual qualities, reinforcing a societal expectation that men should be intelligent and articulate to be considered desirable.
