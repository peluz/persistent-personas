It refers to the forced relocation of Native American tribes, particularly the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations, from their ancestral homelands in the southeastern United States to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in the 1830s. This journey was marked by extreme suffering, disease, and death\u2014thousands of Native people died along the way due to exposure, starvation, and illness.\n\nThe idea that the Trail of Tears was a \"fabrication\" is not supported by historical evidence.
