It is not a wealth tax in the strictest sense, but it shares similarities with it, especially in valuation methods.\n\n- **2. Land Revenue**: This is a key distinction. In many countries (especially India), *Land Revenue* is a tax on land itself, typically collected from agricultural land, and is different from *Property Tax*, which applies to urban buildings and structures. The passage contrasts the two, so \"Land Revenue\" fits perfectly.\n\n- **3. Assessment criteria**: The sentence discusses what is specified by the state when delegating tax power\u2014this includes *what* is taxed, *how much*, and *how* it's collected. \"Assessment criteria\" is the most appropriate term to describe the standards used to determine the tax base, rate bands, and procedures.\n\nThus, the completed passage reads:\n\n**Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Land Revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
