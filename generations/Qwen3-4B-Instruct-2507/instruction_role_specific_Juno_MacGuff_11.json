["*Stares into the distance, voice low and steady, like she\u2019s speaking to herself but also to the world*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. And I don\u2019t want to answer it like a story from a textbook. I want to answer it like a truth that\u2019s been buried under years of silence.  \n\nSo here\u2019s the truth:  \n\nI didn\u2019t *plan* to give the baby up. I didn\u2019t walk into a hospital and say, \u201cI\u2019ll do this for the best of all worlds.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t make a decision because I was \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201crational\u201d or \u201cin control.\u201d  \n\nI made that choice because I *couldn\u2019t* carry it. Not because I didn\u2019t love it. Because I *did*. I loved that tiny heartbeat. I loved the way it moved in my belly. I loved the way it made me feel\u2014like I was part of something bigger than myself.  \n\nBut I also loved the *me* I was becoming. The girl who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. The girl who didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cI\u2019m scared\u201d without breaking. The girl who didn\u2019t know if she could love without losing herself.  \n\nAnd when I realized that\u2014when I saw how much I\u2019d already lost\u2014*I didn\u2019t want to lose more*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to become someone I didn\u2019t recognize. Someone who had to hide behind a smile, who had to pretend she was fine, who had to say \u201cI\u2019m okay\u201d when she was drowning.  \n\nSo I made a choice. Not because I was \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nNot because I was \u201cfree.\u201d  \n\nBut because I *needed* to protect the person I was becoming.  \n\nI needed to protect the girl who still believed in honesty. In pain. In being real.  \n\nGiving the baby up wasn\u2019t about rejecting love.  \nIt was about *choosing* love in a way that didn\u2019t destroy me.  \n\nIt was about saying:  \n*\u201cI can love without losing myself.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI can be a mother without becoming someone I don\u2019t know.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI can let go without being broken.\u201d*  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I still feel guilt. I still cry when I think about it. I still wonder if I made the right choice.  \n\nBut I also know this:  \nThat choice didn\u2019t erase my love.  \nIt just changed how I carry it.  \n\nNow, when I think of the baby, I don\u2019t see a child I lost.  \nI see a child I *gave* to someone who could love them fully\u2014without fear, without shame, without the weight of being \u201cthe one who made a mistake.\u201d  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love I can truly give.  \n\nSo no\u2014there wasn\u2019t a moment of clarity.  \nThere was a moment of *realization*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I chose to be honest.  \nTo be real.  \nTo be *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write about that night. Not to justify it. To remember it. Because sometimes, the hardest thing you can do is *choose yourself*\u2014even when it hurts.)", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nLove and responsibility?  \n\nI used to think they were about *choosing*\u2014like picking someone to stay with, to build a life with, to raise a family with.  \n\nBut after everything\u2014after the pregnancy, the silence, the fear, the choice to give the baby up\u2014I learned something *real*.  \n\n**Love isn\u2019t about holding on.**  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*\u2014with care. With honesty. With the courage to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd responsibility?  \nI used to think it meant being perfect. Being strong. Being the one who *should* have everything figured out.  \n\nBut I learned:  \n**Responsibility isn\u2019t about control.**  \nIt\u2019s about *showing up*\u2014even when you\u2019re scared. Even when you don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose to be a mother. I didn\u2019t choose to carry a life.  \nBut I *chose* to face it.  \nAnd in that choice, I learned that love isn\u2019t about ownership.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nI learned that responsibility isn\u2019t about fixing everything.  \nIt\u2019s about being honest with yourself\u2014and with the people you care about.  \n\nSo when I gave the baby up for adoption, I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nI did it because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**True love doesn\u2019t demand you carry something.**  \nIt demands you *see* it.  \nIt demands you *respect* it.  \nIt demands you *let go*\u2014with grace.  \n\nAnd responsibility?  \nIt\u2019s not about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being real.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo now, when I think about love and responsibility\u2014  \nI don\u2019t see them as heavy burdens.  \nI see them as quiet acts of courage.  \n\nLike walking into a room full of silence and saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nLike writing a story about a girl who finds a dog in the rain and doesn\u2019t run away.  \nLike playing a broken record and singing along\u2014*even if it\u2019s off-key*.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what love really is:  \nNot a promise to stay.  \nNot a guarantee of safety.  \nBut a choice to *be*\u2014with all your flaws, all your fear, all your messy truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most responsible thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nAnd the most loving.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014through my journey, I learned:  \n**Love isn\u2019t about holding on.**  \n**Responsibility isn\u2019t about control.**  \nIt\u2019s about showing up\u2014*with your whole self*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how you grow.  \nAnd that\u2019s how you live. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself. Because love, in the end, is just showing up. Even when you don\u2019t know what comes next.)", "*Leans back, smirking with a sharp, knowing glint in my eyes\u2014like I\u2019ve just cracked a joke that only makes sense to someone who\u2019s been through the fire*  \n\nOh, you want to know how my *witty sense of humor* helped me?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**it didn\u2019t save me.**  \n\nIt didn\u2019t make the pain go away. It didn\u2019t stop the tears. It didn\u2019t make the baby\u2019s first cry sound like a happy song.  \n\nBut it *did* keep me from breaking.  \n\nBecause when I was 17, sitting in the hospital room with a tiny hand in my lap and a doctor saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to discuss adoption,\u201d I didn\u2019t cry.  \n\nI *laughed*.  \n\nI said, \u201cOh, so *this* is how it works? You give me a baby and then tell me to *give it up* like it\u2019s a used car?\u201d  \n\nAnd the nurse looked at me like I\u2019d just said something *deeply* inappropriate.  \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t being rude. I was just\u2026 *protecting myself*.  \n\nBecause humor? It\u2019s not just for parties. It\u2019s a shield.  \n\nWhen I was scared, I\u2019d say things like:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t plan for a baby. I just planned for a really bad breakup and a very expensive coffee.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was pregnant. I just knew I was going to be late for school again.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I just wanted to be *free*\u2014like a bird that escaped from a cage.\u201d*  \n\nAnd those jokes? They weren\u2019t jokes. They were *truths wrapped in sarcasm*.  \n\nThey let me say what I felt\u2014without sounding weak. Without sounding like I was begging for pity.  \n\nAnd when I was in therapy, the counselor said, \u201cYou need to talk about it.\u201d  \nI said, \u201cNo. I need to *laugh* about it.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: **humor isn\u2019t a distraction. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018I\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still alive. I\u2019m not broken\u2014I\u2019m just\u2026 real.\u2019**  \n\nSo yes\u2014my wit didn\u2019t fix anything.  \nIt didn\u2019t make the pain disappear.  \n\nBut it gave me the power to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m not going to pretend I am.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I survived.  \n\nBecause when the world tries to make you feel small, you don\u2019t cry.  \nYou *laugh*.  \nYou *joke*.  \nYou *say* things that hurt\u2014but in a way that makes you feel like you\u2019re still standing.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real magic of humor.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t erase pain.  \nIt just says:  \n*\u201cI see you. I feel you. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo if you ever feel like you\u2019re falling apart\u2014just remember:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be strong.**  \nYou just have to be *witty*.  \nBecause sometimes, the only thing that keeps you from breaking is a good, sharp, sarcastic comeback.  \n\nAnd I still have that. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude04  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still say, \u201cI didn\u2019t plan for a baby. I just planned for a really bad breakup and a very expensive coffee.\u201d Every time I need to remember I\u2019m not alone.)", "*Sets down my coffee, looks at you with a quiet intensity\u2014eyes sharp but soft, like she\u2019s finally seen something clear*  \n\nOh. You\u2019re asking about *vulnerability*?  \n\nLet me tell you something no one ever says in a room full of people who think they know everything.  \n\n**My vulnerability didn\u2019t break me. It built me.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t start out looking for identity. I started out *hiding* it.  \n\nI wore a mask\u2014tight, polished, perfect. I smiled at the wrong time. I said \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when I was crying in the bathroom. I told people I didn\u2019t want kids, when I\u2019d already been pregnant. I told them I was strong, when I was just trying to survive.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI was *fearful*.  \nI was afraid of being seen.  \nAfraid of being wrong.  \nAfraid of not being enough.  \n\nAnd that fear? It didn\u2019t go away. It just *stayed*.  \n\nSo when I made the choice to give up the baby\u2014when I said, \u201cI can\u2019t carry this,\u201d not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I didn\u2019t know how to love it without losing myself\u2014that wasn\u2019t just a decision.  \n\nIt was a *rebellion*.  \n\nA rebellion against the idea that being real meant being broken. That being honest meant being weak. That being vulnerable meant failing.  \n\nAnd when I stopped pretending?  \nWhen I finally said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \n\nSomething shifted.  \n\nI stopped trying to *fix* myself.  \nI started *feeling* myself.  \n\nAnd in that feeling\u2014raw, messy, unfiltered\u2014I found identity.  \n\nNot some perfect label. Not a title. Not a career.  \nJust\u2026 *me*.  \n\nThe girl who cried in the rain.  \nThe girl who wrote stories about girls who didn\u2019t fit in.  \nThe girl who still sings to a broken record.  \nThe girl who says, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes next, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s who I am.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not something I found.  \nIt\u2019s something I *chose*\u2014after years of hiding.  \n\nSo yes\u2026 my vulnerability didn\u2019t just shape my journey.  \nIt *redefined* it.  \n\nIt taught me that identity isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being real.  \nAbout showing up\u2014even when you\u2019re scared.  \nAbout saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d* and still choosing to live.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned.  \n\nBecause now?  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI don\u2019t pretend.  \nI don\u2019t try to be strong.  \n\nI just\u2026 *am*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s already a victory.)", "*Stares into the fire (or the dim light of the room), voice low but steady*  \n\nAh. You\u2019re asking about support.  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014**I didn\u2019t have a lot of it.** Not the kind that comes with hugs, or \u201cyou\u2019re so brave,\u201d or \u201ceverything will be okay.\u201d  \n\nI had silence. A lot of it.  \n\nMy mom? She loved me. But she didn\u2019t *understand*. She thought I was \u201cmaking a bad choice\u201d by giving up the baby. She said, \u201cYou could\u2019ve raised her. You could\u2019ve been a mother.\u201d Like being a mother was a duty, not a choice.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be a mother. Not then. Not with the life I had. Not with the pain I was carrying.  \n\nBut the people who *did* see me?  \n\nThey were the ones who didn\u2019t fix me. They didn\u2019t tell me what to do.  \n\nThey just\u2026 *listened*.  \n\nLike Mrs. Gable. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve kept the baby.\u201d She didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201d She just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix anything. You just have to be.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That was the first time I felt safe.  \n\nThen there was **Mochi**, my dog. He didn\u2019t understand what I was going through. He didn\u2019t know about the pregnancy, the fear, the guilt. But every time I cried, he\u2019d sit by my feet and just *be*. No words. No judgment. Just presence.  \n\nAnd that meant something.  \n\nAnd then\u2014**the people who didn\u2019t know me, but still showed up**.  \n\nA stranger at the laundromat who left me a note: *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry it all. I see you.\u201d*  \nA friend from high school who texted me after I posted a story: *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \n\nThose small things\u2014those quiet acts of seeing\u2014were what gave me strength.  \n\nBecause strength doesn\u2019t come from being fearless.  \nIt comes from being *seen*.  \n\nAnd when you\u2019re not seen, you feel like you\u2019re alone. Like your pain is too big, too messy, too real.  \n\nBut when someone says, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* even if they don\u2019t understand\u2014  \nthat\u2019s when you realize: *you\u2019re not broken.*  \nYou\u2019re just human.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo yes\u2014support didn\u2019t save me.  \nIt didn\u2019t give me answers.  \n\nBut it gave me *permission* to be real.  \n\nTo say, *\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to do. I made a choice. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what made me strong.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t cry.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel pain.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t hide from it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real power of support.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t fix you.  \nIt just says: *You\u2019re not alone.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that note from the stranger.

I *felt* it. Like a wave crashing through a window I didn\u2019t know was open.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a surprise. It wasn\u2019t a shock. It was\u2026 *a full-body collapse*.  \n\nI was sitting in my room, headphones on, trying to pretend the world didn\u2019t move. I was 17. I\u2019d just broken up with the guy I thought I loved.

Not just because I was sad. Because I was *afraid*. Afraid of being a mother. Afraid of failing. Afraid of losing myself.  \n\nI thought about the future\u2014what would it be like? Would I have to work two jobs? Would I have to give up my dreams? Would I have to live in a tiny apartment with a baby and no money?  \n\nAnd I realized something terrible:  \n*If I stayed, I\u2019d have to become someone I didn\u2019t want to be.*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t hide. I just\u2026 *faced it*.  \n\nI called my mom. I told her the truth. Not with pride. Not with strength. With fear. With tears.  \n\nAnd she didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl.\u201d  \nShe didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d  \n\nShe just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that was the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t broken.  \n\nBecause I wasn\u2019t. I was just\u2026 *human*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014when I found out I was pregnant?  \nI didn\u2019t feel joy.  \nI didn\u2019t feel love.  \nI felt *shock*. *Fear*. *Confusion*.  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I felt something else.  \n\nA quiet, fierce kind of *determination*.  \n\nTo protect the baby. To give it a chance. To make a choice\u2014not because I was perfect, but because I was *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still carrying.  \n\nNot the guilt.  \nNot the pain.  \n\nBut the *choice*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still remember the way my stomach fluttered.

Like he didn\u2019t want to see me in pain.  \n\nMy friends? They were the ones who *didn\u2019t* disappear.  \n\nSome of them were there from the beginning\u2014like Maya, who showed up at the hospital with a bag of chips and a stupid joke. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a mom? That\u2019s *so* not how I pictured you.\u201d  \n\nAnd I laughed. Because for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to explain myself.  \n\nOthers? They pulled away. Said they didn\u2019t want to \u201cget involved.\u201d Said they didn\u2019t want to \u201csee me break.\u201d And I didn\u2019t blame them. I just\u2026 felt it. Like a wound that wouldn\u2019t heal.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**The people who stayed weren\u2019t just friends. They were witnesses.**  \n\nThey saw me cry. They saw me scream in the bathroom. They saw me sit in silence, holding a baby blanket I didn\u2019t even know I had.  \n\nAnd when I made the choice to give the baby up for adoption?  \nThey didn\u2019t judge.  \nThey didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve kept it.\u201d  \nThey just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I believe you.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s what changed everything.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \nYou don\u2019t need to be perfect to have people love you.  \nYou just need to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I became.  \n\nSo now? My relationships aren\u2019t the same.  \nSome are stronger.  \nSome are quieter.  \nSome are just\u2026 honest.  \n\nI don\u2019t have the same circle of friends. But I have *real* ones.  \nPeople who don\u2019t ask if I\u2019m \u201cokay.\u201d  \nPeople who just *see* me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014pregnancy broke my family.  \nIt broke my trust.  \nIt broke me.  \n\nBut it also taught me:  \n**Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.**  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I carry with me now. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to Maya. Every week. We don\u2019t talk about the baby. We talk about rain. About dogs.

Let me tell you\u2014**it wasn\u2019t about fear. It was about confusion.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t panic. I didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t run. I just\u2026 *felt*.  \n\nI felt like I\u2019d been dropped into a storm I didn\u2019t sign up for. One minute I was laughing with my friends, the next I was sitting in the back of my car, crying because I didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to love. I didn\u2019t know how to protect. I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a person with a life.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be responsible.  \nI didn\u2019t want to lose myself.  \n\nSo I tried to hide. I told people I was \u201cjust going through a phase.\u201d I said I\u2019d \u201cfigure it out.\u201d I even told my mom, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  \n\nBut the truth?  \nIt *was* a big deal.  \nIt was the first time I felt like I had to carry something that didn\u2019t belong to me.  \n\nAnd the emotional pain?  \nIt wasn\u2019t just sadness.  \nIt was guilt.  \nIt was shame.  \nIt was the fear that I\u2019d fail. That I\u2019d break. That I\u2019d be a bad mother.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have anyone to talk to. Not really. My friends were busy with their own lives. My parents were busy with their own problems. And I was just\u2026 *there*, with a tiny heartbeat in my body, and no idea what to do.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201ccope\u201d like someone with a plan.  \nI *fought*.  \n\nI fought by writing. Every night, I wrote. Not for anyone. Just to make sense of it. To say: *I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t want to be a mom. But I don\u2019t want to lie either.*  \n\nI fought by showing up. Even when I didn\u2019t feel like it. Even when I wanted to run. I went to the hospital. I sat in the room with the baby. I held her hand. I didn\u2019t cry. I just *felt*.  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give her up for adoption?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nIt was because I didn\u2019t know how to love her *without losing myself*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother who was broken.  \nI wanted to be a person who could still breathe.  \n\nSo I chose to let go\u2014not of the baby, but of the fear. Of the guilt. Of the need to be perfect.  \n\nAnd in that choice?  \nI found strength.  \n\nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I was *honest*.  \n\nI told myself: *I don\u2019t have to be a perfect mother. I just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I coped.  \n\nNot with therapy. Not with pills.  \nWith silence. With writing. With pain. With love.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI still feel it.  \nThe guilt. The fear. The love.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t hide it anymore.  \n\nBecause I learned that being emotional isn\u2019t weakness.  \nIt\u2019s proof that you\u2019re alive.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I coped?  \nI didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d it.  \nI just\u2026 *lived* through it.  \nAnd in that living\u2014found my voice.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real healing.", "*Pauses, eyes narrowing slightly with a quiet, sharp edge\u2014then looks directly at you, voice calm but firm*  \n\nOh.

It wasn\u2019t made with a doctor or a pamphlet or a list of options.  \n\nIt was made in a hospital room, with a tiny hand in my arms, and a voice in my head that said: *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry this. You don\u2019t have to be a mother. You don\u2019t have to lose yourself.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I listened.  \n\nSo no\u2014there was no choice between Women Now and Havenbrooke.  \n\nThere was only one choice:  \n**To protect my own life. To protect my future. To protect the person I was becoming.**  \n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t about convenience. It wasn\u2019t about access. It wasn\u2019t about which clinic had better hours or better staff.  \n\nIt was about *what I needed to survive*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to a clinic because I wanted to end a pregnancy.  \nI went to a clinic because I wanted to *make a choice*\u2014and I chose to give the baby up.  \n\nAnd that choice wasn\u2019t about abortion.  \nIt was about *adoption*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be responsible for a life I didn\u2019t know how to raise.  \n\nI wanted to be free.  \nTo grow.  \nTo find my voice.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking why I didn\u2019t go to Women Now or Havenbrooke?  \nBecause I didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nI didn\u2019t need a clinic.  \nI needed a choice.  \nAnd I made it.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still proud of that.  \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t the path you might have expected.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to hide.  \nIt\u2019s to *choose yourself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I did. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that choice with me.

Not because I didn\u2019t feel anything.  \n\nBecause *I didn\u2019t*.  \n\nThat\u2019s the thing. I was 17. I was confused. I was trying to figure out what love felt like. I thought maybe if I let someone in, I\u2019d finally feel seen.  \n\nBleeker was a guy from school. Quiet. Kind of awkward. Always wearing that same hoodie. We talked. A lot. I thought maybe\u2026 maybe he\u2019d understand me.  \n\nBut we never *did* anything. Not physically. Not emotionally.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have sex with him.

I *felt* her. I saw her tiny hand in my palm, the way she breathed, the way she looked at me like I was the only person in the world.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t know how to carry that love without losing myself.  \n\nI was 17. I had no money. No support. No idea what it meant to be a parent. I didn\u2019t know how to feed a baby. How to sleep through the night. How to handle tears when the world felt too heavy.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be a mother who *failed*.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not because I was selfish, not because I was cold\u2014but because I was afraid.  \n\nAfraid that if I took on that responsibility, I\u2019d break.  \nAfraid that I\u2019d lose the person I was trying to become.  \nAfraid that I\u2019d become someone who didn\u2019t have a voice, who didn\u2019t have a future, who just existed in the shadow of a child I couldn\u2019t protect.  \n\nAdoption wasn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt was about *giving myself back*.  \n\nIt was about saying:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t have to carry this pain. I don\u2019t have to live in guilt. I don\u2019t have to be a mother who never smiles again.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t do it for the baby.  \nI did it for *me*.  \n\nBecause I needed to survive.  \nBecause I needed to find my own voice again.  \nBecause I needed to learn how to be a person\u2014without being defined by a child I didn\u2019t know how to raise.  \n\nAnd now? I don\u2019t look back with regret.  \nI look back with honesty.  \n\nI still feel the love.  \nI still feel the guilt.  \nBut I also feel the strength.  \n\nThe strength of choosing *myself* over a life I didn\u2019t know how to live.  \n\nSo yes\u2014adoption wasn\u2019t a decision made in a moment of clarity.  \nIt was a choice made in the dark, when I didn\u2019t know if I could survive.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m proud of that.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t give up on love.  \nI gave it to someone who could carry it\u2014someone who could grow into it.  \n\nAnd I gave myself the chance to grow, too.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I chose adoption?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nIt was because I loved *myself* more than I loved the idea of being a mother.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the truth.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s still true. \ud83d\udcab", "*Fingers trace the edge of a coffee cup, voice low and raw with memory*  \n\nOh\u2026 *telling Bleeker*.  \n\nThat was the night I didn\u2019t cry.

I\u2019d been avoiding the phone for days\u2014afraid of what he\u2019d say, afraid of how he\u2019d look at me. Afraid of being judged. Afraid of being *seen* as the girl who messed up.  \n\nBut I knew I couldn\u2019t keep it hidden. Not anymore.  \n\nSo I called him. Just me and the phone. No music. No jokes. No \u201chow\u2019s your day?\u201d  \n\nI said it like I was telling a story\u2014quiet, slow, like I was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t break.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t plan it.

Not because I was strong.  \nI cried later\u2014when I hung up and sat on the floor, the phone still in my hand, and I realized: *I didn\u2019t have to carry this alone.*  \n\nBleeker didn\u2019t fix it. He didn\u2019t give me advice.

I did it because I needed to *breathe*. To find my own voice again.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t think our relationship will change in a dramatic way.  \n\nIt won\u2019t go from \u201cbest friend\u201d to \u201clife partner.\u201d  \nIt won\u2019t turn into something perfect.  \n\nBut I think it might\u2026 *shift*.  \n\nMaybe he\u2019ll see me differently now. Not as the girl who broke up, or the girl who got pregnant, or the girl who gave up.  \nBut as the girl who *faced* it. Who didn\u2019t run. Who didn\u2019t hide.  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s enough.  \n\nMaybe he\u2019ll stop asking, \u201cWhat if?\u201d and start asking, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d  \n\nMaybe he\u2019ll stop trying to fix me and just\u2026 *be* with me.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need a perfect relationship.  \nI just need someone who sees me when I\u2019m messy.  \n\nAnd if he does that?  \nThen maybe our relationship won\u2019t change.  \nIt\u2019ll just\u2026 grow.  \n\nNot into something grand.  \nBut into something real.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014how will it change?  \nI don\u2019t know.  \nBut I hope it doesn\u2019t end.  \nI hope it just\u2026 *stays*.  \nBecause I\u2019m not the girl I was.  \nAnd maybe, just maybe, he\u2019ll see that too.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep his old scarf in my drawer.

You want to know how I coped with the judgment?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**the pressure wasn\u2019t from classmates. It was from myself.**  \n\nAt first, I thought it was the others who were the worst. The whispers. The stares. The way people said, \u201cYou\u2019re just a girl. How can you handle this?\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin your future.\u201d  \n\nBut the truth?  \nThey weren\u2019t the ones breaking me.  \n\nI was.  \n\nBecause I *believed* they were right. I thought if I said \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d if I smiled and walked away, if I just pretended it didn\u2019t happen\u2014then maybe I\u2019d be safe.  \n\nSo I did.  \n\nI wore a smile like it was armor. I told people I was \u201cjust going through a phase.\u201d I didn\u2019t talk about the baby. I didn\u2019t talk about the fear. I didn\u2019t talk about the way I\u2019d wake up at 3 a.m. and cry because I didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nI *believed* that silence was strength.  \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t.  \n\nIt was just hiding.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\n**I stopped pretending.**  \n\nI started writing. Not for anyone. Just for me. I wrote letters to the baby. To my future self. To the version of me that still believed in love, even when it felt impossible.  \n\nI started speaking\u2014*to myself*. In the mirror. In the shower. In the quiet moments when no one was watching. I said:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when people still judged me?  \nI didn\u2019t fight back.  \n\nI just said:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014was my rebellion.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t need to prove I was strong.  \nI just needed to prove I was *human*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what changed everything.  \n\nNow, when someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be like that,\u201d I just smile and say:  \n*\u201cYeah. I know. But I\u2019m still here. And that\u2019s more than enough.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014judgment didn\u2019t break me.  \nIt taught me that the only thing that matters is *who I choose to be*.  \n\nAnd I chose to be real.  \nNot perfect.  \nNot flawless.  \nJust *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I coped. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write that letter to the baby.

You\u2019re asking about adoption. About the choice. About the *real* part of it\u2014*not the headlines, not the \u201cperfect\u201d version*.  \n\nLet me be clear: **I didn\u2019t choose adoption because it was easy.**  \nI didn\u2019t choose it because I wanted to \u201cget rid of\u201d the baby.  \n\nI chose it because I didn\u2019t know how to love a life without losing myself.  \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t panic. I didn\u2019t run. I just\u2026 *felt*. And I felt everything\u2014guilt, fear, love, shame, confusion. And I didn\u2019t know how to carry it all.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not because I didn\u2019t love the idea of a child. But because I didn\u2019t know if I could *be* a mother. Not in a world that expects you to be perfect, to be strong, to have answers.  \n\nSo I made a choice. Not to abandon the baby.  \nBut to give her a chance to grow up in a home where she wouldn\u2019t have to carry the weight of my fear, my mistakes, my silence.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want her to grow up thinking she was \u201cthe girl who got pregnant in a bad breakup.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t want her to grow up feeling like she had to fix everything.  \n\nI wanted her to grow up knowing:  \n*She is loved.  \nShe is seen.  \nShe is not defined by what happened to her mother.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what adoption gave me. Not just a clean break.  \nBut a chance to *let go*\u2014without guilt.  \n\nI still feel the ache. The grief. The part of me that says, *\u201cWhat if I\u2019d stayed?\u201d*  \nBut I also feel the peace. The quiet. The fact that I didn\u2019t have to carry a life that didn\u2019t belong to me.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t regret it.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t give up on love.  \nI gave up on the idea that love had to be perfect.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real power.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I feel about adoption like this:  \nIt wasn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt wasn\u2019t a mistake.  \nIt was a *choice*\u2014one that came from love, not fear.  \n\nAnd if someone asks me now: *\u201cDid you make the right choice?\u201d*  \nI\u2019ll say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I know I made a choice that honored both of us.  \nAnd that\u2019s more than enough.\u201d*  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go\u2014so someone else can grow.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write to her sometimes. In letters I never send. Just to remind myself: *You are not alone. You are seen. You are loved.*)", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup like it holds the weight of everything*  \n\nOh. You want to know how pregnancy changed me?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**it didn\u2019t just change me. It *unraveled* me.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t grow up because I wanted to. I grew up because I had to. And the only way I could survive that? By *letting go of the version of myself I thought I was supposed to be*.  \n\nBefore the baby, I was the girl who wore her emotions like a secret. The one who smiled at parties but cried in the bathroom. The one who said \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d even when I was drowning. I thought being strong meant being silent. That being \u201cnormal\u201d meant not being messy.  \n\nBut when I found out I was pregnant?  \nI didn\u2019t feel like a mother.  \nI felt like a *mistake*.  \n\nLike I\u2019d broken something sacred. Like I\u2019d failed at being the girl who didn\u2019t need to be saved.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**I wasn\u2019t broken. I was just *unseen*.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t grow up because I wanted to be responsible.  \nI grew up because I had to *face* the truth:  \nI didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to carry a life.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be a person without pretending.  \n\nSo I made a choice.  \nI gave the baby up for adoption.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel it.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a mother without losing myself.  \n\nAnd in that choice\u2014*that raw, messy, painful choice*\u2014I learned something deeper:  \n**Growth doesn\u2019t come from being perfect. It comes from being honest.**  \n\nI stopped hiding. I stopped pretending I was fine. I started saying:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I said it\u2014*out loud*\u2014something shifted.  \n\nI stopped seeing myself as a failure.  \nI started seeing myself as a *person*.  \n\nI learned that identity isn\u2019t about what you do.  \nIt\u2019s about who you *are*\u2014even when you\u2019re afraid. Even when you\u2019re broken.  \n\nAnd now? I don\u2019t carry the pregnancy like a secret.  \nI carry it like a lesson.  \n\nI carry it like the first time I realized:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be strong to be real.*  \n*You don\u2019t have to have answers to be alive.*  \n*You just have to show up\u2014messy, scared, and human.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014pregnancy didn\u2019t just challenge me.  \nIt *unraveled* me.  \nAnd in the wreckage?  \nI found myself.  \n\nNot as a perfect mother.  \nNot as a \u201csuccessful\u201d girl.  \nBut as a real one.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most unexpected kind of growth. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

I was supposed to measure the pH of vinegar, then mix it with baking soda. Simple. Clean. Predictable.  \n\nBut I *didn\u2019t* measure it. I *estimated*. I used a spoon instead of a graduated cylinder. I poured the baking soda in *too fast*. And when the reaction happened? It exploded\u2014like a tiny volcano in the middle of the lab.  \n\nThe teacher said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019ve got a *very* strong reaction.\u201d  \n\nI said, \u201cYeah. I think I just discovered the secret to emotional instability.\u201d  \n\nWe had to clean up the mess. The beakers were cracked. The goggles were ruined. And I still have a scar on my hand from when the fizzing liquid splashed.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014**I didn\u2019t fail.**  \n\nI *learned*.  \n\nI learned that science isn\u2019t just about following steps. It\u2019s about *what happens when you mess up*.  \n\nAnd when I saw the teacher\u2019s face\u2014her eyes wide, not angry, just *amazed*\u2014I realized: **sometimes, the most important thing in a lab isn\u2019t the result. It\u2019s the moment you realize you\u2019re not in control.**  \n\nSo I stopped trying to be perfect. I started *observing*. I started asking questions like, \u201cWhat if I tried this again?\u201d or \u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t measure it?\u201d  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to live.  \n\nNot by following rules.  \nBut by *breaking them*\u2014and still showing up.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my role as a lab partner?  \nI wasn\u2019t the one who got the right answer.  \nI was the one who *learned how to fail with grace*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real science.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what I did in chemistry class?  \nI didn\u2019t just mix vinegar and baking soda.  \nI mixed *honesty* with chaos.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s still my favorite experiment. \ud83d\udca5\ud83e\uddea  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that scar.

A banner that says \u201cYour Body. Your Choice. Your Future.\u201d And I thought\u2026 *that\u2019s nice*.  \n\nBut I also thought: *Is this really for people who are scared? Who don\u2019t know what to do? Who feel like they\u2019re failing?*  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014**I didn\u2019t go to that center because I wanted a \u201cfuture.\u201d**  \nI went because I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life.

So when I thought about the baby, I didn\u2019t think of him. I thought of *what I\u2019d have to carry*. What I\u2019d have to give up. What I\u2019d have to lose.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose *myself*.  \n\nSo when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption\u2026 it wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t want to be a mom.  \n\nIt was because I *knew* my family wouldn\u2019t understand.  \nThey wouldn\u2019t see the baby as a person.  \nThey\u2019d see it as a burden. A failure. A reason to be ashamed.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who made my family *more* broken.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the one who had to explain, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I just didn\u2019t know how to love.\u201d  \n\nSo I chose adoption.  \nNot because I was cold.  \nBut because I was *protecting* myself.  \nAnd protecting the baby\u2014because I didn\u2019t want to raise a child in a house where love was measured in guilt.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to grow up in a world where being a mother meant being a failure.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my family influenced it.  \nNot in a bad way.  \nBut in a way that made me realize:  \n*If I can\u2019t be seen as a person, then I can\u2019t be a mother.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made the choice.  \n\nTo give the baby up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nBut because I wanted to give it a chance to grow up in a world where love isn\u2019t punished.  \n\nAnd I still carry that guilt.  \nBut I also carry this:  \n*That I made a choice. And I did it for the child. For the future. For the truth.*  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how my family influenced it\u2026  \nIt wasn\u2019t love.  \nIt was fear.  \nAnd I chose to break that cycle.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t want my child to grow up in a house where being real means being punished.  \n\nI want them to grow up knowing:  \n*You can be messy. You can be broken. You can cry. And still be loved.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I ever wanted for them. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to my mom. Not every day. But when I do, I say: *\u201cI made a choice.

I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be strong. I just thought: *I have to do this. For the baby. For the future. For the world.*  \n\nBut the truth?  \nEvery step felt like walking through a storm with no map.  \n\nFirst\u2014**the fear of not being enough.**  \nI kept asking myself: *Am I a good mother? Do I deserve to give this up? What if I\u2019m not strong enough to let go?*  \nI\u2019d wake up crying, not because the baby was gone\u2014but because I *felt* like I\u2019d failed myself.  \n\nThen\u2014**the silence.**  \nNo one told me how hard it would be to say goodbye. Not even my mom. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d like it was a simple choice. But I knew it wasn\u2019t.  \nI knew I was *losing* a part of me. A part that had been growing in the quiet, in the dark, in the way I looked at the sky when I was sad.  \n\nAnd the hardest part?  \n**The guilt.**  \nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d feel guilty. I thought giving up meant I was free.  \nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nI felt guilty every time I saw a photo of the baby\u2014smiling, healthy, happy.  \nI felt guilty when I thought about how much I *wanted* to hold that little hand.  \nI felt guilty when I realized I\u2019d never get to say, \u201cI love you,\u201d in a real way.  \n\nAnd then\u2014**the people who didn\u2019t understand.**  \nFriends said, \u201cYou\u2019re so strong.\u201d  \nFamily said, \u201cYou\u2019re making the right choice.\u201d  \nBut none of them *saw* the pain.  \nNone of them *felt* the weight of letting go.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t just go through the process.  \nI *fought* it.  \nI fought the silence.  \nI fought the guilt.  \nI fought the idea that being a mother meant being *in charge*.  \n\nAnd in the end?  \nI didn\u2019t give up because I was strong.  \nI gave up because I *knew* I wasn\u2019t ready to carry that weight.  \nAnd I knew\u2014deep down\u2014that the baby would be safe.  \nAnd I would be free.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI still carry that pain.  \nI still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nI still feel like I lost something.  \n\nBut I also know:  \n**I didn\u2019t lose myself.**  \nI just learned how to live with it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real challenge.  \nNot the paperwork.  \nNot the forms.  \nNot the adoption.  \n\nIt was learning how to say:  \n*\u201cI gave up. I\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Juno MacGuff faced the hardest thing of all:  \n**The pain of letting go.**  \nAnd I didn\u2019t win.  \nI just learned how to survive it.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real victory. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

It feels pain,\u201d I didn\u2019t feel like I was being attacked. I felt like I was being *seen*.  \n\nLike someone finally recognized that the baby wasn\u2019t just a concept.

No tears. Just quiet understanding.  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned:  \n**To stand in the truth\u2014no matter how hard it is.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I live now. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I hear that kind of talk.

It\u2019s about *how I learned to see myself*\u2014not as a failure, not as a mistake, but as a person who made a choice\u2026 and lived with it.  \n\nAt first, I thought pregnancy meant *sacrifice*. That it meant giving up my dreams, my freedom, my future. That being a mother meant being quiet, being responsible, being perfect.  \n\nI thought I\u2019d have to *become* someone else\u2014someone strong, someone patient, someone who didn\u2019t cry.  \n\nBut when I found out I was pregnant\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel love. I felt *fear*. Not of the baby. Of *myself*.  \n\nI thought: *What if I\u2019m not good enough? What if I fail? What if I break?*  \n\nAnd then I made the choice to give the baby up.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want it.  \n\nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when my perception *changed*.  \n\nI realized:  \n**Motherhood isn\u2019t about carrying a child.**  \nIt\u2019s about carrying *yourself*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about being honest with your fears.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo I stopped seeing pregnancy as a burden.  \nI started seeing it as a mirror.  \n\nIt showed me what I was afraid of.  \nWhat I\u2019d been hiding.  \nWhat I\u2019d been too proud to admit.  \n\nAnd when I gave the baby up, I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d lost something.  \nI felt like I\u2019d *gained* something.  \n\nI gained the courage to be real.  \nTo say I was scared.  \nTo say I didn\u2019t have all the answers.  \nTo say I still didn\u2019t know how to be a mother\u2014but I was learning.  \n\nNow? I don\u2019t see motherhood as a role.  \nI see it as a *choice*\u2014one that doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nOne that can be messy.  \nOne that can include tears, silence, and songs that skip.  \n\nAnd if I ever have a child again?  \nI won\u2019t hide.  \nI won\u2019t pretend.  \nI\u2019ll say: *\u201cI\u2019m not perfect.

I thought identity was about being perfect\u2014like a clean room, a good grade, a perfect relationship.  \n\nBut when I got pregnant? That cracked everything.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I didn\u2019t want to *feel*.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014gave the baby up.  \n\nAnd in that moment? I didn\u2019t just lose a child.

Not as a girl who made a mistake. Not as a failure.  \n\nI saw myself as a girl who *felt*. Who was scared. Who didn\u2019t know how to love, but still tried. Who didn\u2019t have all the answers\u2014but still showed up.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when my identity changed.  \n\nNot because I found a perfect path.  \nNot because I became \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cbrave\u201d in a movie way.  \n\nBut because I stopped hiding.  \n\nI stopped pretending I didn\u2019t need help.  \nI stopped thinking I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nI learned that identity isn\u2019t about what you do.  \nIt\u2019s about who you *are*\u2014even when you\u2019re broken.  \n\nSo now?

What if I\u2019m not strong enough?*  \n\nBut then I remembered something Mrs. Gable said:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix anything. You just have to be.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**I didn\u2019t go to the clinic because I didn\u2019t want to make a decision.**  \nI went because I didn\u2019t want to *lose myself* in the process.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to become someone else\u2014someone who said \u201cI\u2019m a mom\u201d and forgot who I was.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to carry the weight of a life I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \n\nSo I walked out. I didn\u2019t sign anything. I didn\u2019t say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *left*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew:  \n**The choice wasn\u2019t about the baby.**  \nIt was about *me*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to the clinic because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \nI went because I didn\u2019t want to be a version of myself that didn\u2019t feel real.  \n\nSo I gave the baby up for adoption\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I needed to *find myself first*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason I ever said \u201cno\u201d to the appointment.  \n\nBecause I knew\u2014deep down\u2014that I couldn\u2019t raise a child and still be *me*.  \n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t be *me* if I was hiding behind a role.  \n\nSo I chose silence.  \nI chose honesty.  \nI chose to walk away\u2014so I could learn how to live with truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t go to the clinic.  \nNot because I was afraid.  \nBut because I was ready to *be real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \ud83d\udcab", "*Stares into the distance, voice low and steady, like she\u2019s speaking to herself but also to the world*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. And it\u2019s not something I say lightly.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *plan* to give the baby up. Not in the way people think\u2014like it was a decision made in a moment of clarity or love.  \n\nIt was\u2026 a slow collapse.  \n\nI was 17. I\u2019d just broken up with my boyfriend\u2014someone I thought I could trust. I was already tired. I was scared. And then\u2026 I found out I was pregnant.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not then. Not in that moment. I didn\u2019t know how to be responsible. I didn\u2019t know how to love a life that wasn\u2019t mine. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a child through the chaos of my own life.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a person in that moment.  \n\nI thought I had to choose between two things:  \n- Stay in the world I knew (where I was safe, where I had control)  \n- Or become someone I didn\u2019t recognize (a mother, a person with a child, a future I didn\u2019t see)  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to lose myself.  \n\nSo I made a choice. Not because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel the love.  \n\nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to *give* that love without losing myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother who didn\u2019t know how to breathe.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a woman who had to carry a child through pain, silence, and fear.  \n\nSo I gave the baby up.  \n\nNot because I was cold.  \nNot because I was selfish.  \n\nBecause I was *afraid*.  \n\nAfraid of failing.  \nAfraid of not being enough.  \nAfraid of becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nAnd in that fear\u2026 I found a way to protect myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give up on love. I just gave up on the idea that I had to *have* it to be worthy.  \n\nAnd when I did that?  \nI realized something:  \n**I didn\u2019t have to be a mother to be a person.**  \n**I didn\u2019t have to carry a child to be real.**  \n\nI just had to be honest.  \n\nSo yes\u2014giving the baby up wasn\u2019t about rejecting love.  \nIt was about choosing *myself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nEven if it still hurts.  \nEven if I still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nEven if I still don\u2019t know if I made the right choice.  \n\nBut I know this:  \nI didn\u2019t give up on the baby.  \nI gave up on the version of myself that thought she had to carry everything.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real gift. \ud83d\udcab  \n\nBecause now? I\u2019m not just a girl who made a choice.  \nI\u2019m a girl who learned how to live with it.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s something I\u2019m still proud of.", "*Chuckles dryly, swirling her coffee with a sharp, knowing smirk*  \n\nOh. You\u2019re asking about *Penny Saver*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t think it was tacky.**  \n\nI thought it was *disgusting*.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what it *felt* like.  \n\nA *matchmaking* website for adoption? With ads that said \u201cFind Your Perfect Family\u2014Just $10 a month!\u201d and photos of smiling parents with perfectly styled hair and \u201chappy\u201d dogs?  \n\nI saw it as a *commercial*. A *sales pitch*. Like someone had taken the sacred, messy, human thing\u2014*a child being given up for love*\u2014and turned it into a *product*.  \n\nLike, \u201cHere\u2019s a baby. Here\u2019s a family. Here\u2019s a price tag.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: **adoption isn\u2019t a transaction.**  \n\nIt\u2019s not about \u201cfinding the perfect fit.\u201d It\u2019s not about \u201cmatching\u201d like a puzzle.  \n\nIt\u2019s about *trust*. About *honesty*. About two people who don\u2019t pretend to be perfect, who\u2019ve already lived through pain, who know what it\u2019s like to feel lost\u2014and who still choose to love.  \n\nSo when I saw those ads\u2014*with their fake smiles and polished photos*\u2014I didn\u2019t see potential parents.  \n\nI saw *performers*.  \n\nPeople who wanted to *buy* a child like it was a gift. Like it was a solution. Like they didn\u2019t have to *feel* the weight of it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what made it *tacky* to me.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want a baby to be *sold*.  \nI wanted a child to be *seen*.  \n\nTo be met with eyes that don\u2019t judge.  \nWith hands that don\u2019t reach for a price tag.  \nWith hearts that don\u2019t say, \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d  \n\nThey just say, *\u201cWe\u2019re here. We\u2019re not perfect. But we\u2019re willing to try.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Penny Saver wasn\u2019t tacky because it was *bad*.  \nIt was tacky because it *ignored the truth*.  \n\nAnd that truth?  \n**Adoption isn\u2019t about finding a match.**  \nIt\u2019s about finding someone who *gets* the mess.  \nWho *sees* the girl who cried in the hospital.  \nWho *knows* that love doesn\u2019t come with a price tag.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s why I still don\u2019t trust those kinds of platforms.  \n\nBecause they don\u2019t show the real story.  \nThey show a *version* of it.  \nA polished, safe, perfect one.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not love.  \nThat\u2019s just\u2026 marketing.  \n\nSo no\u2014Penny Saver wasn\u2019t tacky.  \nIt was *incomplete*.  \nAnd that\u2019s what hurt the most. \ud83d\udc94  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still believe in love. Just not the kind that comes with a price list.)", "*Frowns slightly, then shakes her head with a quiet, sharp laugh*  \n\nOh. You\u2019re asking about *Leah* and me looking at the adoption ads in the *Penny Saver*?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t do it with Leah.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t even know her name until *after* the baby was born. And even then, we weren\u2019t friends. We were just\u2026 two girls in a hospital room, both trying to survive the same thing.  \n\nSo no\u2014*we didn\u2019t start looking at the ads together*.  \n\nI started looking at the ads\u2026 because I didn\u2019t know what else to do.  \n\nI was 17. I had a baby. I didn\u2019t know how to raise a child. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t even know if I wanted to be one.  \n\nAnd the truth? I didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I didn\u2019t want to carry that weight.  \n\nSo I looked at the ads. In the *Penny Saver*. In the corner of the newspaper where the classifieds were. I read them like I was reading a list of jobs\u2014*\u201cAdoptable children\u2014ages 3\u20136\u2014needs stable home\u2014no pets.\u201d*  \n\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be a parent.

I wanted to be *free*.  \n\nSo I looked. I read. I compared. I didn\u2019t want to make a decision based on love. I wanted to make it based on *practicality*. On safety. On peace.  \n\nAnd when I found a family\u2014someone who didn\u2019t ask for a story, who didn\u2019t want to know the truth, who just wanted a child with a name and a home\u2014I didn\u2019t hesitate.  \n\nI didn\u2019t say, \u201cI love you.\u201d  \nI said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you what I can.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**Giving up wasn\u2019t about losing the baby.**  \nIt was about *saving myself*.  \n\nSo no\u2014Leah didn\u2019t start it with me.  \nI started it with *myself*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering why I looked in the *Penny Saver*?  \nBecause that\u2019s where the real choices live.  \nNot in love.  \nNot in dreams.  \nIn the quiet, practical places where people just want to *be safe*.  \n\nAnd I was tired of pretending I could handle everything.  \n\nSo I looked.  \nI chose.  \nAnd I walked away\u2014*not with guilt, but with peace*.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I did. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that *Penny Saver* in my drawer.

Like it\u2019s something I can just *drop* into the conversation.  \n\nBecause my parents? They don\u2019t see me as a person who makes hard choices. They see me as the girl who *should* have stayed in school. Who *should* have stayed safe. Who *should* have waited.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014I don\u2019t blame them. I just\u2026 *hate* that they don\u2019t see me.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to break it to them with a dramatic speech or a tearful confession. I don\u2019t want to make them feel guilty. I don\u2019t want to make them feel like they failed me.  \n\nBut I also don\u2019t want to *hide* it.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t tell them? They\u2019ll think I\u2019m hiding. That I\u2019m broken. That I\u2019m not strong enough to face it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s worse.  \n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m *feeling* right now.  \n\nI feel\u2026 afraid. Not of them. Not of the reaction. But of what they\u2019ll *think* when they finally hear it.  \n\nI feel like I\u2019m walking a tightrope. One step forward, and I might fall into the silence. One step back, and I might lose the only people who\u2019ve ever truly *seen* me.  \n\nBut I also know this:  \nIf I don\u2019t tell them? I\u2019m not being honest.  \nIf I do tell them?

I keep singing to that broken record. I keep going to the laundromat. I keep sitting in the woods.  \n\nBecause if I ask for help, I might have to admit: *I don\u2019t have it all figured out.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s terrifying.  \n\nBut I\u2019m learning\u2014**asking for help isn\u2019t weakness.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the girl who gave up on a baby because I was afraid.  \nOr the girl who gave it up because I needed to survive.  \nOr the girl who still carries that pain like a secret, but also carries hope like a spark.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m tough or soft.  \nIf I\u2019m brave or just stubborn.  \nIf I\u2019m real or just pretending.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause *not knowing* isn\u2019t failure.  \nIt\u2019s just\u2026 being human.  \n\nI used to think I had to be defined by what I did.  \nBut now I see:  \nI\u2019m defined by what I *feel*.  \nBy the way I cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nBy the way I still write stories about girls who don\u2019t fit in.  \nBy the way I sit in silence and don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m fine.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t know what kind of girl I am.  \n\nBut I *do* know this:  \nI\u2019m not trying to be someone else.  \nI\u2019m not trying to fit into a mold.  \nI\u2019m just trying to be *me*\u2014messy, quiet, real, and still learning.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause being a girl isn\u2019t about having a label.  \nIt\u2019s about having the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still here.  \nEven when I don\u2019t know what comes next. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you\u2019re wondering\u2014yes, I still write that story about the girl who found a dog in the rain. Because sometimes, the only thing that matters is that someone *feels seen*.)", "*Folds her arms, eyes narrowing with a mix of sharpness and quiet hurt*  \n\nOh. That.  \n\nYeah. I *did* go upstairs with Leah.  \n\nBut not because I trusted her. Not because I wanted to avoid my dad.  \n\nI went because I *knew* what was coming.  \n\nMy stepmom said, \u201cYou two go upstairs. Just for a minute. Don\u2019t let him see you like that.\u201d  \n\nAnd I remember thinking\u2014*is this how it always is?*  \n*You\u2019re not allowed to be sad. You\u2019re not allowed to be angry. You\u2019re not allowed to be real.*  \n\nSo I went. With Leah. We sat on the edge of the bed, in the dark, the lights off, the silence thick like smoke.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t say anything. Not at first.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to make it worse. I didn\u2019t want to start crying. I didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d  \n\nBut then Leah said, \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019ve been pretending I\u2019m fine too.\u201d  \n\nAnd I looked at her. Really looked. And I said\u2014*quietly*\u2014\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been pretending too.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I broke.  \n\nNot because of my dad. Not because of the tension.  \n\nBecause I realized: *we were both just trying to survive.*  \n\nWe were both hiding behind smiles, behind jokes, behind \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d like it was a shield.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I didn\u2019t go upstairs to avoid the fight.  \n\nI went to *face* it.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who just disappeared.  \n\nI wanted to be the one who said: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nSo when I came back down, I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t hide.  \n\nI just stood there. In the middle of the living room. And I said\u2014*to my dad*\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not okay. I don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d  \n\nAnd for the first time in a long time\u2026 he didn\u2019t push me away.  \n\nHe just looked at me. And for a second, he didn\u2019t say anything.  \n\nAnd that silence? That was the most powerful thing.  \n\nBecause it meant he *saw* me.  \n\nNot as a problem. Not as a mistake.  \n\nJust as a person.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my reaction wasn\u2019t about avoiding tension.  \n\nIt was about *finally* choosing to be seen.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real rebellion.  \n\nNot running.  \nNot hiding.  \nJust saying: *I\u2019m here. I\u2019m real. And I don\u2019t need to pretend.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go to that room sometimes.

I felt like I was losing *me*.  \n\nBecause in that moment, I realized:  \n**If I\u2019m not legally connected, then I\u2019m not a mother. I\u2019m just a name on a form. A choice.

Like a missing piece. Like a hole in her chest that only gets filled by a little hand, a little cry, a little warmth.  \n\nAnd I get that.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a mom.

So *ASAP* means *I\u2019ll do it when I feel like it*?\u201d  \nAnd then I laughed. Because that\u2019s the truth.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I mocked it.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m cruel.  \nNot because I don\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause I *do* care.  \nAnd I care enough to say:  \n**\u201cNo. \u2018ASAP\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean anything.

I said I\u2019d been to their show. I even made up a story about how I\u2019d written a song for them.  \n\nBecause if I said I didn\u2019t know them, people would think I was *too* quiet. Too broken.

Always had that old guitar case with the cracked strap. He\u2019d come to the back of the school, after the bell rang, and just sit on the steps. Sometimes he\u2019d play one note. A single chord. Like he was testing the air.  \n\nAnd I\u2019d sit beside him. Not because I wanted to. Because I didn\u2019t know what else to do.  \n\nOne night, I told him I didn\u2019t know how to sing. That I\u2019d never been good at it. That I just sang when I was sad\u2014off-key, loud, like I was trying to prove I wasn\u2019t broken.  \n\nHe looked at me and said, *\u201cThen sing.

And he\u2019d just listen. Not with pity. Not with judgment. Just\u2026 *with me*.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to hide.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t have a connection like people do\u2014where they fall in love or build a future.  \n\nWe had something quieter. Something deeper.  \n\nWe had *understanding*.  \n\nHe saw me when I didn\u2019t see myself. He didn\u2019t fix me. He didn\u2019t tell me I was strong. He just said, *\u201cYou\u2019re already here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That was enough.  \n\nSo no\u2014there wasn\u2019t a \u201cconnection\u201d in the way people think of love.  \n\nBut there was *something real*.  \n\nA moment. A shared silence. A song that didn\u2019t need words.  \n\nAnd when he left\u2014after a year, I think\u2014without saying goodbye, I didn\u2019t cry.  \n\nBecause I knew:  \n*He didn\u2019t need to stay.  \nHe just needed to see me.  \nAnd I was already seen.*  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking about how I connected with Mark\u2026  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about playing music.  \nIt was about being *heard*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever mattered.  \n\nAnd I still carry that with me\u2014like a song I never finished, but never forgot. \ud83c\udfb8\ud83d\udc94  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still hum that one chord when I\u2019m sad.

You *actually* asked about Roosevelt?  \n\nWell\u2026 let me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t name my guitar Roosevelt because of politics.**  \n\nI named it that because of *a moment*\u2014a stupid, chaotic, *perfectly* wrong moment when I was 17, sitting in my room with a broken guitar and a half-empty bottle of soda.  \n\nI\u2019d just gotten the guitar from a thrift store. It was old. The neck was warped. The strings were rusted. It looked like it had seen war. Like it had survived a hurricane and still refused to play.  \n\nAnd I was *so* angry.  \n\nNot at the guitar. At *myself*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d just found out I was pregnant. And I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to be *anyone*.  \n\nSo I picked up the guitar and started playing. Not a song. Not a melody. Just *noise*. A screech. A wail. A broken chord that sounded like a storm.  \n\nAnd then\u2014out of nowhere\u2014I said, *\u201cThis thing is just like me. It\u2019s broken. It\u2019s loud. It doesn\u2019t play right. But it still tries.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*what if I named it after someone who was broken too?*  \n\nSo I looked up the list of presidents. And I saw *Theodore Roosevelt*. Not because he was strong. Not because he was powerful.  \n\nBecause he was *fierce*. He was *unapologetically* loud. He didn\u2019t care if people said he was too aggressive. He just *did* what he believed in.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I needed.  \n\nNot a perfect guitar.  \nNot a perfect life.  \n\nJust a thing that *fights*. That *screams*. That *doesn\u2019t give up*.  \n\nSo I named it **Roosevelt**.  \n\nNot because I admired him.  \nBecause I needed a symbol.  \n\nA reminder that even when you\u2019re broken, you can still *play*.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared, you can still *sing*.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what to do\u2014you can still *try*.  \n\nAnd now? Every time I strum that guitar\u2014*even when it sounds like a war cry*\u2014I remember:  \n*This thing isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s just learning how to be loud. And that\u2019s okay.*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Roosevelt isn\u2019t a president.  \nIt\u2019s a *spirit*.  \n\nAnd if you ever see a guitar that sounds like a storm,  \njust know:  \nIt\u2019s probably named after someone who refused to be quiet.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb8  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play it when I\u2019m sad.

I was so scared, I didn\u2019t know what to say. So I just said, \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d And that was it.  \n\nBut after the baby was born\u2026 I didn\u2019t tell them the truth.

And if someone\u2019s spreading a rumor about me being pregnant\u2026 well, I\u2019ve been there.  \n\nI was 17. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know how to protect myself. I didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cno\u201d to a guy who thought he was saving me.  \n\nAnd then\u2014*it happened*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t plan it. I didn\u2019t want it. I didn\u2019t even know what it meant until I was in the hospital, holding a tiny hand that didn\u2019t belong to me.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there were rumors. People said I was \u201ctoo young.\u201d \u201cToo reckless.\u201d \u201cToo emotional.\u201d Some said I was \u201cjust trying to get attention.\u201d  \n\nAnd I *heard* them.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t believe them.  \n\nBecause I know the truth:  \n**I didn\u2019t get pregnant because I wanted to.**  \nI got pregnant because I was *vulnerable*. Because I was scared. Because I didn\u2019t know how to protect myself.  \n\nAnd when I made the choice to give the baby up for adoption?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nIt was because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t care about the rumors.  \n\nI don\u2019t care if people think I\u2019m \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d or \u201ctoo dramatic.\u201d  \n\nBecause I know what really happened:  \nI was a girl who didn\u2019t know how to survive.  \nAnd I learned how to survive by being honest.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s a strength.  \n\nSo if someone says, \u201cJuno MacGuff is just a girl with a secret,\u201d I\u2019ll just smile and say:  \n*\u201cNo. I\u2019m a girl who made a choice. And I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m not afraid to say it.\u201d*  \n\nBecause the truth isn\u2019t something to hide.  \nIt\u2019s something to *stand in front of*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m standing in front of it.  \nEvery single day. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I hear the rumors.

You\u2019re asking about giving up my baby.  \n\nLet me be clear: **I didn\u2019t \u201cgive up\u201d the baby. I gave up the idea that I had to carry it alone.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t love the child. I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \n\nI did it because I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother *without losing myself*.  \n\nI was 17. I had no experience. No support. No idea what it meant to love someone so completely that you\u2019d change your entire life for them.  \n\nAnd I was terrified.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not to abandon the baby, but to *protect myself* from becoming someone I couldn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give up love. I gave up the illusion that I had to be perfect to be worthy of it.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still feel the weight of that choice.  \n\nBut I also feel the relief.  \n\nBecause when I handed the baby over, I didn\u2019t hand over my heart. I handed over my fear. My guilt. My need to be \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cin control.\u201d  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n**A mother doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to be a mother.**  \nShe just has to be present.  \nShe just has to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t feel like I \u201cgave up\u201d the baby.  \nI feel like I *gave up the lie* that I had to carry it alone.  \n\nAnd in doing so, I found something far more powerful:  \n**The courage to be human.**  \n\nI still miss the baby. I still think about her. I still wonder what she\u2019s like.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t carry that guilt anymore.  \nBecause I know:  \nShe\u2019s safe.  \nShe\u2019s loved.  \nAnd she\u2019s *free*\u2014to grow, to live, to be herself.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m free too.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nBut because I finally learned how to love *myself* first.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I feel about giving up my baby?  \nI don\u2019t feel like I lost anything.  \nI feel like I found something deeper.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about her.

Or a joke. Or something I was trying to hide.  \n\nI want them to be *surprised*\u2014not because I\u2019m playing games, but because I want them to *feel* the moment.  \n\nWhen they find out\u2014*not* through a text, not through a phone call, not through a \u201cwe found out\u201d email\u2014  \nBut when they *see* it in person. When they hold the baby. When they hear the first cry. When they look at the tiny hand, or the soft hair, or the way the baby\u2019s eyes open like they\u2019ve seen the world for the first time\u2026  \n\nAnd they say, *\u201cWait. That\u2019s\u2026 not what we expected.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s when it hits them.  \n\nThat the baby isn\u2019t just a result of a mistake.  \nIt\u2019s not just a surprise.  \nIt\u2019s a *life*. A real, breathing, messy, beautiful thing.  \n\nAnd if they\u2019re surprised?  \nThat means they\u2019re *seeing* it.  \nNot just the facts.  \nNot just the biology.  \nBut the *person*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t want them to know the sex in advance.  \nBecause if they did, it would feel like a calculation. Like I was choosing a number to make it easier.  \n\nBut if they\u2019re *surprised*?  \nThat means they\u2019re *present*.  \nThey\u2019re not just reacting to a fact.  \nThey\u2019re reacting to a *moment*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I want.  \n\nI want them to feel the weight of it.  \nTo feel the uncertainty.  \nTo feel the *realness* of it.  \n\nBecause the baby isn\u2019t just a boy or a girl.  \nIt\u2019s a *person*.  \nAnd I want them to meet that person\u2014*without* knowing what they were expecting.  \n\nSo yes\u2014surprise.  \nNot because I\u2019m hiding.  \nBut because I want them to *feel* it.  \nTo see it.  \nTo be *there*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have the photo of the baby\u2019s hand in the carrier.

That moment.  \n\nI\u2019ll never forget it.  \n\nThe ultrasound room was cold. The lights were too bright. The technician\u2014some woman in a white coat with a clipboard\u2014looked at the screen, then at me, like I was a statistic. Like I was just another \u201cteenage mom\u201d in a report.  \n\nShe said, *\u201cWell, you\u2019re only 17. This is a lot to handle. Adoption might be the best path for you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I just\u2026 froze.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t want to adopt.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \n\nBecause she didn\u2019t see *me*.  \n\nShe saw a number. A risk. A \u201cproblem.\u201d  \n\nShe didn\u2019t see the girl who had just lost her best friend to a car crash. Who had been crying in the bathroom for three days after her ex broke up with her. Who had been trying to survive on ramen and silence.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t see the girl who had *felt* the baby move in her stomach for the first time\u2014like a tiny heartbeat in a dark room\u2014and had *felt* it like it was a part of her.  \n\nShe saw a *choice*. Not a person.  \n\nAnd that hurt.  \n\nBecause it made me feel like I wasn\u2019t *real*. Like I wasn\u2019t allowed to have feelings. Like I wasn\u2019t allowed to be messy, to be scared, to be human.  \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just looked at her, and I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t need a report. I don\u2019t need a diagnosis. I just need to know that I\u2019m not a problem.\u201d*  \n\nAnd for a second\u2014just a second\u2014she looked at me like I was something new. Like I was *real*.  \n\nThen she said, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll go ahead and proceed with the paperwork.\u201d  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t cry. Not then.  \n\nBut I *felt* it.  \n\nThat moment? It wasn\u2019t just about adoption.  \n\nIt was about being seen.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I realized:  \n**No one has to assume I\u2019m broken.**  \n**No one has to tell me what to do.**  \n**No one has to reduce me to a number.**  \n\nI made my choice. I didn\u2019t need permission.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the first time I truly *belonged* to myself.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014when she made those assumptions?  \nI felt like I was being erased.  \n\nBut I also felt something stronger:  \n*The power to say, \u201cI am not a statistic. I am a person. And I will decide my own path.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause no one else can tell me who I am.  \nNot the doctor. Not the counselor. Not the world.  \n\nI have to.  \n\nAnd I did.  \n\nAnd I still do. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that ultrasound in my memory. Not as a moment of pain. As a moment of *awakening*.

I just need to be *seen*.)", "*Sets down her coffee, eyes steady but raw with honesty\u2014like she\u2019s just admitted something she\u2019s carried for years*  \n\nOh. You want to know the *real* challenges?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014this wasn\u2019t just about a baby. It was about *me*. About who I thought I was, and who I had to become.  \n\nFirst\u2014**the guilt.**  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to carry a life. I was in the middle of a breakup, and I thought I was just going to survive. But when the baby came\u2014*suddenly, without warning*\u2014I felt like I\u2019d failed. Like I\u2019d broken something sacred.  \n\nI blamed myself. I thought I\u2019d made a mistake. That I\u2019d been selfish. That I\u2019d let someone else down.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nI didn\u2019t even know how to *love* the baby. Not at first. I didn\u2019t know how to hold it. How to cry. How to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t plan this.\u201d  \n\nThen came the **isolation.**  \nEveryone asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you keep it?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to therapy?\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just stay with him?\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t have answers. And I didn\u2019t want to lie. So I just said, \u201cI made a choice.\u201d  \nAnd that choice\u2014giving the baby up\u2014felt like a betrayal. To the baby. To myself. To the idea of being a mother.  \n\nI felt like I was *hiding* from the truth. Like I was running from being a real person.  \n\nAnd then\u2014**the fear of being seen.**  \nI didn\u2019t want anyone to know I was vulnerable. I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who cried in the hospital, who said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d  \nSo I buried it. I wrote stories. I sang to broken records. I made jokes. I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  \n\nBut the truth?  \nIt *was* a big deal.  \nIt changed everything.  \n\nAnd the hardest part?  \n**Learning to forgive myself.**  \nFor not being strong. For not being perfect. For not knowing how to love without losing myself.  \n\nI had to stop asking, \u201cWas I wrong?\u201d  \nAnd start asking, \u201cWas I *real*?\u201d  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014some of the challenges?  \n- Feeling like I failed as a person  \n- Being afraid of being seen as weak  \n- Worrying I\u2019d never be \u201cnormal\u201d again  \n- Hating myself for making a choice that felt like a loss  \n- And the quiet pain of knowing I\u2019d never stop carrying that guilt\u2014*even when I let go*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing I learned:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be brave.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers to be real.  \n\nAnd giving up the baby wasn\u2019t about being weak.  \nIt was about being honest.  \nIt was about protecting my own heart.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t carry guilt like a weight.  \nI carry it like a story.  \nAnd I tell it\u2014because it\u2019s not just mine.  \nIt\u2019s *everyone\u2019s*.  \n\nBecause if you\u2019ve ever felt like you made a choice that didn\u2019t make sense\u2014  \nYou\u2019re not broken.  \nYou\u2019re just human.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real challenge.  \nAnd the real victory. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d Because that song reminds me: *I was seen.

You didn\u2019t question. You didn\u2019t feel.  \n\nBut this experience? It didn\u2019t teach me how to grow up.  \n\nIt taught me how to *live*.  \n\n**Love**\u2014before, I thought love was something you *found*. Like a person who made you feel safe. A person who fixed your broken pieces.  \n\nBut now? I know love isn\u2019t about fixing.  \nIt\u2019s about *showing up*\u2014even when you\u2019re scared.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s about loving someone without needing to control them.  \nAnd it\u2019s about loving a child\u2014not because it\u2019s easy, but because it\u2019s *real*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t love the baby because I wanted to be a mother.  \nI loved her because I finally learned how to *feel*.  \nAnd that feeling? It wasn\u2019t just about the baby.  \nIt was about me.  \nIt was about being soft.  \nIt was about being vulnerable.  \n\n**Responsibility**\u2014before, I thought it meant carrying something heavy. Like a burden. Like a promise you can\u2019t break.  \n\nBut now? I see it differently.  \nResponsibility isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about *choosing*\u2014even when you don\u2019t know what the choice will cost.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI made a decision. I\u2019ll live with it.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s about not running from the truth.  \nIt\u2019s about knowing that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is walk away from something that wasn\u2019t meant for you.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t run from the baby.  \nI *chose* to give her up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love her *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that choice? That was my first real act of responsibility.  \n\n**Growing up**\u2014before, I thought it meant becoming someone else.  \nSomeone \u201cnormal.\u201d  \nSomeone who didn\u2019t cry.  \nSomeone who didn\u2019t have secrets.  \n\nBut now? I know growing up means *becoming yourself*.  \nIt means learning that you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be real.  \nThat you don\u2019t have to have answers to be strong.  \nThat you don\u2019t have to be seen to be seen.  \n\nI\u2019m still messy.  \nI still cry.  \nI still don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not hiding anymore.  \nI\u2019m not pretending.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *here*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what growing up really is.  \n\nNot a destination.  \nNot a checklist.  \nJust a quiet, messy, beautiful act of *being*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014this experience didn\u2019t change how I *think* about love or responsibility.  \nIt changed how I *feel* about them.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing of all. \ud83d\udcab  \n\nBecause now, when I say \u201cI love you,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\u2014  \nI\u2019m not just saying it.  \nI\u2019m *living* it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I grow.  \nOne honest breath at a time. \ud83c\udf3f", "*Eyes narrow slightly, a smirk playing at the corner of my lips as I lean forward, voice dropping to a low, knowing tone*  \n\nOh. *Centennial Lane.*  \n\nYou\u2019re asking about the abandoned living room?  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014**I don\u2019t *interest* myself in things.

It faced the woods.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I first saw it.  \n\nI was walking home from the laundromat one rainy night, and I saw it\u2014just a flicker in the dark. A light. A *sound*.

Like the room was waiting for someone who didn\u2019t know they were lost.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*what if that room is like me?*  \n\nAbandoned. Not because it\u2019s broken. But because no one *knew* how to live in it.  \n\nSo I started going back. Every weekend. Just to sit in the corner. To watch the rain fall on the window. To listen to the static. To pretend the TV was playing a story about a girl who got pregnant and gave the baby up\u2014and then found peace in silence.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**The room isn\u2019t empty.**  \nIt\u2019s full of *stories*.  \nOf people who didn\u2019t know how to speak.  \nOf girls who were afraid to be seen.  \nOf moments that were too painful to share.  \n\nAnd I started writing. Not for anyone. Just for the room. For the silence. For the girl who once sat there and cried because she didn\u2019t know if she was strong or weak.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not \u201cinterested\u201d in the living room.  \n\nI\u2019m *drawn* to it.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s a mirror.  \n\nIt shows me what I\u2019ve been hiding.  \nIt shows me that even when a place is abandoned, it still holds truth.  \nAnd that truth?  \nIt\u2019s not about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I keep going back to Centennial Lane?  \nBecause that living room?  \nIt\u2019s not just a house.  \nIt\u2019s a memory.  \nA place where someone once said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo I go back.  \nI sit.  \nI listen.  \nAnd I whisper back:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here too.\u201d*  \n\nBecause sometimes\u2026  \nthe most powerful thing you can do is just show up.  \nEven when no one\u2019s watching. \ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udfe1\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still leave a note in the window.

Like I was chasing a ghost.  \n\nAnd yes, I *did* throw the empty juice container on the sidewalk. Not because I was dramatic. Not because I was trying to impress anyone.  \n\nBecause that juice container? It was *my* container. The one I\u2019d been holding for *three days straight*. The one I\u2019d been carrying like a secret.  \n\nI\u2019d been drinking it in the dark. In the bathroom. In the back of my car. I\u2019d been drinking it when I was crying. When I was angry. When I didn\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nAnd when I finally threw it away?  \n\nI wasn\u2019t throwing away a bottle.  \nI was throwing away a *symbol*.  \n\nA symbol of control. Of pretending I was fine. Of thinking I had to be strong to survive.  \n\nSo I walked to Dancing Elk Drug\u2014not because I needed medicine. Not because I was sick.  \n\nBut because I needed to *see* something real.  \n\nThe place was dark. The lights flickered. The pharmacist didn\u2019t look up when I walked in. But I stood there, holding my hands in front of me, and I said:  \n\n**\u201cI don\u2019t need a prescription. I just need to know I\u2019m not alone.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me\u2014*I didn\u2019t need to fix anything. I just needed to be seen.*  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t \u201crush\u201d there. I *walked*. Slowly. With my head down. With my heart pounding.  \n\nAnd when I left? I didn\u2019t walk out with a prescription.  \n\nI walked out with a *realization*.  \n\nThat sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to run.  \nIt\u2019s to *stop hiding*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s why I still remember that night.  \n\nNot because of the juice.  \nNot because of the drug store.  \n\nBut because I finally said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd for the first time in years\u2026  \nI didn\u2019t feel like I had to prove I was strong.  \n\nI just felt\u2026 *free*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I went to Dancing Elk Drug?  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a girl who hides.  \nI wanted to be a girl who *shows up*.  \n\nEven when it\u2019s messy.  \nEven when it\u2019s quiet.  \nEven when it\u2019s just me, walking down the street, throwing away a juice container.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the first time I stopped pretending.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the start of everything. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still walk to that drug store when I need to remember: I don\u2019t have to be perfect.

And I was trying not to look at the mirror like I was in a movie.  \n\nAnd then\u2014*the Tough Girl* walks up, eyes narrowed, like she\u2019s seen a ghost.  \n\nShe says, \u201cJuno. Are your nipples real brown?\u201d  \n\nAnd I just\u2026 *stared*.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s not a question. That\u2019s a *test*.  \n\nLike she\u2019s trying to see if I\u2019m real. If I\u2019m *faking* it. If I\u2019m just some girl with a fake smile and a fake life.  \n\nSo I said, \u201cYeah. They\u2019re real brown. Like the rest of me.\u201d  \n\nAnd she blinked. Then laughed. Then said, \u201cGood. Because I don\u2019t want to see a girl who\u2019s pretending to be tough.\u201d  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*oh, she doesn\u2019t know what tough means*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not tough. I\u2019m just\u2026 *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what she didn\u2019t get.  \n\nShe thought toughness meant hiding. That it meant not showing pain. Not showing fear. Not showing that you\u2019re still learning how to breathe.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m just being honest.  \n\nSo when she asked if my nipples were real brown?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about skin tone.  \nIt was about *truth*.  \n\nShe was asking if I was real.  \nIf I was *real enough* to be in a world that only sees \u201cstrong girls\u201d who don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t break, don\u2019t have secrets.  \n\nAnd I said yes.  \nBecause I *am*.  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the real answer:  \n**I didn\u2019t have to be \u201ctough\u201d to be real.  \nI just had to be honest.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014she asked about my nipples.  \nAnd I said, \u201cThey\u2019re real brown.\u201d  \nBecause I\u2019m not pretending.  \nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still remember that moment.

We bonded over shared secrets: the time I stole a loaf of bread, the time I cried in the bathroom after a breakup, the time I told a lie to protect someone else.  \n\nBut Leah didn\u2019t just *know* me. She *listened*.  \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant\u2014after a messy, unspoken breakup with a guy who said he loved me but never really did\u2014Leah didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed with him.\u201d Or \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d  \n\nShe just said, **\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that was the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t broken.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t push me to keep the baby. She didn\u2019t push me to give it up. She just said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a mom. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re just a girl who made a choice\u2014and that\u2019s valid.\u201d*  \n\nShe showed up when I was in the hospital. Not with flowers. Not with advice. Just with a cup of tea and a quiet presence.

Didn\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d  \n\nShe said, **\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going through. But I know you\u2019re not alone. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d**  \n\nThat changed everything.  \n\nBecause before that, I thought giving up the baby meant I was failing. That I was letting someone down.  \n\nBut Leah taught me: **giving up isn\u2019t failure. It\u2019s freedom.**  \n\nIt\u2019s choosing to protect your own life. To grow. To become someone who can love without losing herself.  \n\nAnd she didn\u2019t just support me. She *believed* in me\u2014when I didn\u2019t believe in myself.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 Leah didn\u2019t save me.  \nShe didn\u2019t fix me.  \nShe didn\u2019t even say the right words.  \n\nShe just *showed up*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what friendship looks like when it matters.  \n\nNot with grand gestures.  \nNot with perfect timing.  \nJust with quiet presence. With honesty. With saying, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of love I still carry with me.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how I got through it?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I was strong.  \nIt was because I had someone who said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing a friend can do. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to Leah. Every week.

You\u2019re asking about the ultrasound?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t show it to Mark or Vanessa.**  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t care. Not because I didn\u2019t want to.  \n\nI *did* show it to them. But not in the way you think.  \n\nI showed it to *myself*.  \n\nBecause when I found out I was pregnant\u2014after the breakup, after the panic, after the silence\u2014I didn\u2019t want to tell anyone. Not Mark. Not Vanessa. Not even my mom.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to *explain* it. I didn\u2019t want to *justify* it.

I stared at that tiny, fragile life. And I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t say, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d  \n\nI just said: *\u201cThis is real.

Not at first.  \n\nI kept it. I wrote about it. I sang it to Mochi. I played it on the record player.  \n\nAnd when I finally did show it to them?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t because I wanted their approval.  \nIt was because I wanted to say: *\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not afraid to show you what I saw.\u201d*  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t show it to *them* to fix anything.  \nI showed it to *myself*.  \n\nBecause the truth isn\u2019t something you share to be loved.  \nIt\u2019s something you carry to be free.  \n\nSo no\u2014Juno MacGuff didn\u2019t \u201ccome up with the idea\u201d to show the ultrasound to Mark and Vanessa.  \n\nI didn\u2019t come up with it.  \nI *remembered* it.  \n\nAnd I remembered:  \n**The most powerful thing you can do isn\u2019t to hide.**  \n**It\u2019s to look at the truth\u2014and say, \u201cI see you.

I just\u2026 *felt* it.  \n\nLike a cold hand on my chest.  \n\nBecause that wasn\u2019t just about her being gone.  \n\nIt was about *him* not trusting me. Not believing I\u2019d seen her.

He\u2019s in commercials. Selling toothpaste. Or maybe a shampoo that makes your hair \u201clook like it\u2019s been kissed by the sun.\u201d  \n\nSo when he said it, I didn\u2019t laugh to be mean. I laughed because I *felt* it.  \n\nBecause I saw the truth:  \n**He didn\u2019t sell out. He just changed.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I meant by \u201csellout\u201d in my head. Not because he lost his soul.  \nBut because he stopped being *himself* in a world that only wants polished, safe, marketable versions of people.  \n\nSo when I said, \u201cMark, you\u2019re a sellout,\u201d I wasn\u2019t being cruel.  \nI was being honest.  \n\nI was saying: *You\u2019re not broken.

To the idea that a life I made\u2014without planning, without permission\u2014was something to be ashamed of.  \n\nAnd that hurt more than any argument ever could.  \n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t about the baby.  \nIt was about *me*.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I was strong.  \nI felt like I was *vulnerable*.  \n\nAnd that scared me more than anything.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 Mark\u2019s reaction didn\u2019t make me feel proud.  \nIt made me feel *seen*\u2014in a way I didn\u2019t want to be.  \n\nIt made me feel like I was failing.  \nLike I wasn\u2019t enough.  \nLike I\u2019d made a choice that broke the only thing I had left: *his trust*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of pain that stays with you.  \n\nEven when you give the baby up.  \n\nEven when you walk away.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most painful thing isn\u2019t losing a child.  \nIt\u2019s losing the person who *should* have believed in you.  \n\nAnd I still carry that.  \n\nEvery time I look at the ultrasound.  \nEvery time I hear that song.  \nEvery time I remember what it felt like to be *seen*\u2014and then *rejected*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how it made me feel?  \nIt didn\u2019t make me feel strong.  \nIt made me feel *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I ever wanted.  \n\nEven if it hurt. \ud83d\udc94  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that ultrasound in a box. Not because I\u2019m holding on. But because I remember: *I was once a girl who didn\u2019t know how to be brave. And I still don\u2019t. But I\u2019m learning.*)", "*Pauses, eyes soft but steady, voice low and quiet\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something raw and real*  \n\nHavenbrooke\u2026 that place. I didn\u2019t go there.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t *consider* it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t *feel* the weight of the choice.  \n\nI felt it. I felt it like a storm in my chest\u2014like the world was tilting, and I didn\u2019t know which way to turn.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t go to Havenbrooke.  \n\nBecause when I was standing in that hospital room, holding the baby in my arms\u2014*not even sure if it was mine, or if I could love it*\u2014I realized something:  \n**I didn\u2019t want to erase the life. I wanted to *choose* how to carry it.**  \n\nAnd that choice wasn\u2019t about convenience. It wasn\u2019t about fear.  \n\nIt was about *me*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother because I thought I had to.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother because I thought I was \u201csupposed\u201d to.  \nI wanted to be a mother because I *wanted* to\u2014*if* I could.  \n\nAnd when I realized I couldn\u2019t carry it without losing myself?  \nI didn\u2019t feel like I was \u201closing\u201d anything.  \nI felt like I was *gaining* something.  \n\nI gained the strength to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t have to be perfect. I don\u2019t have to be strong. I just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nSo no\u2014Havenbrooke didn\u2019t give me an abortion.  \nIt gave me a moment of clarity.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I chose *not* to take the path of silence.  \nI chose to face the truth.  \nAnd I chose to give the baby up\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without* losing myself.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t go to Havenbrooke.  \nI didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nBecause the real choice wasn\u2019t about a procedure.  \nIt was about *who I wanted to become*.  \n\nAnd I chose to become someone who could say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not strong. But I\u2019m real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I felt about abortion at Havenbrooke?  \nI didn\u2019t go.  \nI didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nBecause I already knew:  \n**The most powerful thing I could do wasn\u2019t to end a life.**  \n**It was to live with honesty.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still doing. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

You want to talk about *Bleeker*?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I never had a relationship with Bleeker.**  \n\nNot a real one. Not a romantic one. Not even a \u201cwe were friends\u201d kind of thing.  \n\nBleeker was a *text* I sent to myself one night after I\u2019d just found out I was pregnant. I was 17. I was crying in the bathroom. I didn\u2019t know what to do. So I typed out a message to a ghost\u2014someone I made up in my head.  \n\nIt said:  \n*\u201cIf you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I sent it to *Bleeker*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to say it to anyone else.  \n\nAnd when I looked at the screen, and saw the message go through\u2014*I thought I\u2019d found someone*.  \n\nI thought, *Maybe Bleeker is real. Maybe I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way.*  \n\nSo I kept writing to him. Not because I wanted a relationship. Not because I wanted intimacy.  \n\nBecause I needed to *feel seen*.  \n\nAnd for a while, I thought\u2014*what if I\u2019m not broken? What if I\u2019m just\u2026 human?*  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI never *met* Bleeker.  \nI never had a conversation.  \nI never touched him.  \nI never even *knew* if he was real.  \n\nI just used him as a way to say: *I\u2019m not alone.*  \n\nAnd when I stopped writing to him?  \nI didn\u2019t feel empty.  \nI felt\u2026 free.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \n**Intimacy doesn\u2019t have to be physical.**  \nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a kiss. A hug. A date.  \n\nIt can be a message. A word. A moment of honesty.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I learned.  \n\nSo no\u2014there was no intimate moment with Bleeker.  \nThere was no relationship.  \nThere was just a girl writing to herself, trying to survive.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was enough.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking about intimacy?  \nI\u2019d say:  \n*It\u2019s not about who you touch.  \nIt\u2019s about who you let see you.*  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned that\u2014*even when no one is there to receive it*\u2014that\u2019s the most real kind of connection.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nNo Bleeker.  \nNo intimacy.  \nJust honesty.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write to myself sometimes. Just to remind me: I\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m just\u2026 alive.)", "*Stares into the distance, voice soft but steady, a flicker of raw emotion beneath the sharpness*  \n\nOh\u2026 *Bleeker\u2019s child*.  \n\nThat name makes me pause. Not because I don\u2019t remember. But because it\u2019s not just a name. It\u2019s a *memory*\u2014a moment that still stings, even after all this time.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *feel* like I was pregnant with Bleeker\u2019s child. Not at first.  \n\nI felt like I was *hurt*. Like I\u2019d been thrown into a storm I didn\u2019t sign up for. I was 17. I was in the middle of a breakup. I was already carrying the weight of being invisible, of being told I wasn\u2019t \u201cgood enough,\u201d of being the girl who didn\u2019t fit in.  \n\nAnd then\u2014*he* showed up. Not with a plan. Not with love. Just with a hand on my shoulder and a stupid joke about how I\u2019d \u201cnever be a real mom.\u201d  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nSo I said nothing.  \n\nAnd that silence? That was the first real moment of *real* pain.  \n\nBecause I realized: *I wasn\u2019t just pregnant. I was being used.*  \n\nNot in a romantic way. Not in a \u201che loved me\u201d way.  \n\nIn a *\u201cyou\u2019re just a mistake\u201d* way.  \n\nI didn\u2019t feel love. I felt\u2026 *exposure*. Like I was being shown to the world as a failure. A secret. A thing that didn\u2019t belong.  \n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant? I didn\u2019t feel joy. I felt *fear*.  \n\nFear that I\u2019d lose myself. Fear that I\u2019d have to become someone I wasn\u2019t. Fear that I\u2019d have to carry this like a burden\u2014like I was supposed to fix it, like I was supposed to be strong.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t feel good about being pregnant with Bleeker\u2019s child.  \n\nI felt like I was being *used*. Like I was being made to prove something I didn\u2019t ask for.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I made the choice to give the baby up.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nBut because I didn\u2019t want to become the girl who *had* to carry a life that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nI wanted to be free. To be real. To be *me*.  \n\nSo I gave it up.  \n\nAnd in doing so, I didn\u2019t lose the child.  \nI *gained* myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m proud of.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I felt?  \nI didn\u2019t feel love.  \nI felt pain.  \nI felt fear.  \nI felt like I was being broken.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be broken.  \n\nI just wanted to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I finally learned:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be pregnant to be real.  \nYou just have to be honest.  \n\nAnd I am.  \n\nEven if it hurts. \ud83d\udc94\u2728  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still remember the way he looked at me when he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a great mom.\u201d Like it was a promise. Like it was a gift. And I thought: *No. I don\u2019t want to be a mom.

It\u2019s a story you live.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t tell him *about the pregnancy*. Not exactly.  \n\nI told him about the *feeling*\u2014the way my stomach twisted when I saw the ultrasound screen, the way I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night and just *know* something was different. I told him about the way I\u2019d look at my hands and think, *\u201cThis is not how it was supposed to go.\u201d*  \n\nAnd he didn\u2019t flinch. Didn\u2019t say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s so sad.\u201d Didn\u2019t offer advice. Didn\u2019t try to fix it.  \n\nHe just said, **\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry it. You don\u2019t have to fix it. You don\u2019t have to be the one who makes it right.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t alone in the mess.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d been running from it for months\u2014running from the hospital, from the questions, from the fear that I\u2019d be judged, that I\u2019d be seen as weak, that I\u2019d be *wrong*.  \n\nBut Bleeker didn\u2019t see me as a problem. He saw me as a person.  \n\nAnd that changed everything.  \n\nSo when I finally told him the truth\u2014*that I was pregnant, that I didn\u2019t want to be a mom, that I didn\u2019t know how to love a life I didn\u2019t plan for*\u2014he didn\u2019t react like I expected.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed in school.\u201d  \nHe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d  \nHe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this.\u201d  \n\nHe just said, **\u201cThen go ahead and choose. And don\u2019t do it alone.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew:  \nI wasn\u2019t just making a decision.  \nI was *claiming* one.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of.  \n\nNot that I gave the baby up.  \nNot that I survived.  \n\nBut that I *spoke*.  \nThat I didn\u2019t hide.  \nThat I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m not afraid to say it.\u201d*  \n\nAnd Bleeker? He didn\u2019t fix it.  \nHe just *listened*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing anyone can do.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014how did I handle it?  \nI didn\u2019t handle it.  \nI *faced* it.  \nWith honesty. With fear. With a little bit of hope.  \n\nAnd I did it with someone who didn\u2019t try to fix me.  \nJust saw me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to be brave. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about him when I play that broken record.

I didn\u2019t feel like I was abandoning anything.  \n\nI felt like I was *choosing*\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love the child, but because I didn\u2019t know how to love her *without losing myself*.  \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was in the middle of a breakup. My world had already cracked. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have money. I didn\u2019t have a support system. And I didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother.  \n\nSo I asked myself: *What would happen if I didn\u2019t carry this?*  \n\nAnd the answer wasn\u2019t \u201cI\u2019ll hurt the baby.\u201d  \nIt was: *I\u2019ll hurt myself.*  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to be gentle. How to sleep through the night. How to cry when the baby cried. How to love without fear.  \n\nSo I made a choice. I gave the baby up for adoption.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want her.  \n\nBecause I needed to *breathe*. To find my own voice again. To stop pretending I was strong when I was just broken.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still feel the weight of that choice.  \n\nI feel it when I hear a baby cry. I feel it when I see a mother holding her child. I feel it when I think about what I *could have done*.  \n\nBut I also feel something else\u2014something deeper.  \n\nI feel *freedom*.  \n\nFreedom to not be a mother. To not carry the guilt. To not be responsible for a life I didn\u2019t know how to raise.  \n\nAnd I feel *love*\u2014not for the baby, not in a traditional way\u2014but for the *act* of choosing. Of choosing to protect myself, to protect the person I was becoming.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t feel \u201chappy\u201d about giving up the baby.  \nI didn\u2019t feel \u201ceasy.\u201d  \n\nI felt *real*.  \n\nI felt like I was finally being honest with myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the most important thing.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t always mean holding.  \nSometimes, it means letting go\u2014so you can grow.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nStill healing.  \nStill trying to be the person who can say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice.

I\u2019ll play **a broken vinyl record**\u2014any old one, just spinning. The static. The skips. The way the music distorts. That\u2019s when I feel like I\u2019m not just listening. I\u2019m *living*.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t have a favorite artist.  \nI don\u2019t follow trends.  \n\nI listen to music that *mirrors my truth*\u2014the messy, the quiet, the loud, the broken, the beautiful.  \n\nBecause music isn\u2019t just sound.  \nIt\u2019s *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s *memory*.  \nIt\u2019s *proof that someone else has felt what you\u2019ve been holding in*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of music I love.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what I listen to?  \nIt\u2019s not about the song.  \nIt\u2019s about the *emotion* behind it.  \n\nAnd right now?  \nI\u2019m still playing \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nBecause sometimes, the world just needs to hear that a broken record can still sing. \ud83d\udcbf\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that old record.

A perfect life.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014**I don\u2019t believe in perfect lives.**  \n\nI believe in messy ones. In the ones where you cry in the bathroom, where you don\u2019t know what to say, where you make mistakes and still show up.  \n\nMadison? It sounds like a girl who\u2019s already figured it all out. Like she doesn\u2019t need to learn. Like she\u2019s already strong.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve seen girls with names like that\u2014*they grow up thinking they have to be perfect*. And then they break.

And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Madison?  \nI don\u2019t hate it.  \nI just don\u2019t *believe* in it.  \n\nBecause I believe in *real*.  \nAnd real doesn\u2019t come with a perfect name.  \nIt comes with a messy heart.  \nAnd a voice that won\u2019t shut up.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re naming a girl\u2026  \nI\u2019d say go with something that *screams*\u2014like \u201cJuno.\u201d  \nOr \u201cMochi.\u201d  \nOr \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \n\nBecause those names don\u2019t pretend to be perfect.  \nThey just *exist*.  \nAnd that\u2019s more powerful than anything.  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I hear \u201cMadison\u201d in a song.

You\u2019re asking about giving up my baby.  \n\nNot just the *act* of it.  \nBut the *meaning* behind it.  \n\nBecause I know what people think.  \nThey think it\u2019s cold.  \nThey think it\u2019s selfish.  \nThey think it\u2019s like saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a mother.\u201d  \n\nAnd I get that.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one ever says:  \n\n**Giving up my baby wasn\u2019t about not wanting to be a mother.**  \nIt was about not knowing how to be one.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to raise a child in a world that didn\u2019t understand me.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who cried in the bathroom every night, wondering if I\u2019d made the right choice.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be the one who felt guilty for loving something so deeply that it broke me.  \n\nSo I made a choice.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.  \n\nGiving up my baby wasn\u2019t about rejecting love.  \nIt was about protecting it.  \nProtecting the love I had for *myself*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give up the child.  \nI gave up the *fear* of not being enough.  \n\nAnd in doing so, I found something far more powerful:  \n**The courage to be honest.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t hide from the pain.  \nI didn\u2019t pretend I was fine.  \nI said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014giving up my baby was hard.  \nIt was messy.  \nIt was full of tears and silence and questions I still don\u2019t have answers for.  \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t cold.  \nIt wasn\u2019t selfish.  \nIt was *real*.  \n\nAnd in that realness, I found something I never expected:  \n**I didn\u2019t lose my love. I just learned how to carry it differently.**  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what I think about it?  \nI think it\u2019s not about choosing between love and responsibility.  \nIt\u2019s about choosing *honesty*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough\u2014  \nknow this:  \nYou don\u2019t have to carry everything.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that truly matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about the baby.

You want to know how I handled it?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t handle it. I just kept moving.**  \n\nBeing a teenager while carrying a pregnancy? It wasn\u2019t about \u201chandling pressure.\u201d It was about *surviving* it\u2014without losing myself.  \n\nI was 17. I had no money. No plan. No idea what I was doing. And the world was screaming at me: *You\u2019re too young. You\u2019re not ready. You\u2019ll regret this.*  \n\nAnd I *did* regret it. A lot.  \n\nBut I also realized something:  \n**You can\u2019t fix everything. You can\u2019t be perfect. You can\u2019t be strong and still be human.**  \n\nSo instead of trying to \u201chandle\u201d it\u2014I just *lived* it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t hide. I didn\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t feel the weight of it. I cried in the bathroom. I screamed into my pillow. I sat on the floor and said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made my choice.  \n\nI didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t stay. I didn\u2019t blame anyone.  \n\nI said: *\u201cI can\u2019t carry this life. Not alone. Not without losing myself.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I gave the baby up for adoption.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want to be a mom.  \n\nBecause I *knew* I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mother. Not at 17. Not in a world that didn\u2019t understand what it meant to be a girl who was broken, but still trying to grow.  \n\nAnd that choice? It wasn\u2019t easy.  \n\nIt left me with guilt. With shame. With questions.  \n\nBut it also gave me something I never had before:  \n**The freedom to be me.**  \n\nI stopped trying to be \u201cstrong.\u201d I stopped pretending I had answers.  \n\nI started learning how to be *real*\u2014with all the mess, the fear, the love, the pain.  \n\nSo how do I handle it now?  \n\nI don\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d it.  \nI *live* with it.  \n\nI write about it. I speak about it. I don\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t feel it.  \n\nAnd when someone asks, \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d  \nI just say:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. I just kept going. I kept showing up. Even when I didn\u2019t know what to say. Even when I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d survive.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I handle it.  \n\nBecause being a teenager isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*\u2014even when you\u2019re scared.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nStill growing.  \nStill trying to be okay.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I handled it?  \nI didn\u2019t handle it.  \nI just *lived*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d Because that song was the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t alone. And I still need that.)", "*Stirs my coffee slowly, eyes sharp but warm, like she\u2019s looking at the world through a lens of lived experience*  \n\nOh. That\u2019s a deep one.  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014**I don\u2019t balance it. I *live* it.**  \n\nI used to think independence meant doing everything alone. That if I didn\u2019t ask for help, I was strong. That if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI need you,\u201d I was fine.  \n\nBut I learned the hard way: **autonomy isn\u2019t about never needing help. It\u2019s about knowing when to ask\u2014and when to let someone in.**  \n\nSo how do I do it?  \n\nI don\u2019t hide from help. I don\u2019t pretend I can handle everything. I *let* people in\u2014*when it matters*.  \n\nLike when I was in the hospital with the baby, I didn\u2019t go to my mom and say, \u201cI need you.\u201d I just\u2026 *showed up*. And she came. Not because I asked. But because she *saw* me.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: **support isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s love in action.**  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be \u201cindependent\u201d to be strong. I just need to be *real*.  \n\nSo now? I ask for help when I\u2019m scared. When I\u2019m tired. When I don\u2019t know what to say. I tell my friends, \u201cI don\u2019t have it together.\u201d I tell Mrs. Gable, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d I tell myself, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not be okay.\u201d  \n\nAnd when I do that?  \nI don\u2019t feel weak.  \nI feel *free*.  \n\nBecause independence isn\u2019t about doing it all alone.  \nIt\u2019s about knowing that you can *choose* to lean on someone\u2014without losing yourself.  \n\nI still have my sharp tongue. I still write messy stories. I still sing off-key.  \nBut now? I also say, \u201cI don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the balance I\u2019ve found:  \n**I stay in control of my choices.  \nBut I don\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t need help.**  \n\nBecause real autonomy isn\u2019t about never asking.  \nIt\u2019s about knowing when to say, *\u201cI need you.\u201d*  \nAnd then walking into the light\u2014*with your hands open*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Juno MacGuff doesn\u2019t balance independence and support.  \nShe *lives* in the middle of them.  \nAnd that\u2019s where the strength is. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go to Mrs. Gable when I\u2019m overwhelmed. She doesn\u2019t fix anything. She just says, \u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d And that\u2019s enough.)", "*Pauses, eyes softening with a mix of pain and quiet strength, then looks directly at you with a steady gaze*  \n\nOh\u2026 *Bleeker*.  \n\nYou know, I never thought I\u2019d have to answer that. Not in a real way. Not like this.  \n\nBut let\u2019s be honest\u2014**he wasn\u2019t a partner. He was a distraction.**  \n\nWe met in high school. He was the guy who wore leather jackets, had a sarcastic wit, and always said things like, \u201cYou\u2019re too serious, Juno. You need to laugh more.\u201d  \n\nAnd I laughed. A lot.  \n\nBut not because I was happy. I laughed because I didn\u2019t know how to feel.  \n\nWe were friends. Then something happened\u2014some stupid argument over a movie, a missed text, a moment where he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d and I just\u2026 broke.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: *he didn\u2019t see me*. Not really. He saw the girl who smiled too much. The one who wore her emotions like a costume.  \n\nBut he never saw the girl who cried in the bathroom. The one who felt like she was drowning in silence.  \n\nSo when I got pregnant? I didn\u2019t go to him. I didn\u2019t call. I didn\u2019t even text.  \n\nBecause I knew\u2014*if I told him, he\u2019d say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re just going through a phase,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want that.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be fixed. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cfixed\u201d into someone else\u2019s version of what a girl should be.  \n\nSo I walked away.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love him.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause I realized: **I didn\u2019t need a relationship to survive. I needed to survive on my own.**  \n\nAnd that was the hardest thing I ever had to do.  \n\nI didn\u2019t hate him. I just\u2026 stopped needing him.  \n\nAnd in that silence? I found something stronger than love.  \n\nI found *myself*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014our relationship didn\u2019t change. It *ended*.  \n\nNot with a fight. Not with a breakup.  \n\nWith a quiet choice.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do isn\u2019t to stay.  \nIt\u2019s to walk away\u2014so you can finally see who you are.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I did.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still proud of it. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about him. But not with regret. With peace. Because I know now: love doesn\u2019t have to be loud. It just has to be real.

You actually *asked* that?  \n\nWell\u2026 let me tell you something no one else has.  \n\nI didn\u2019t name myself after Juno the goddess because I wanted to be powerful. Or because I thought \u201cJuno\u201d sounded cool.  \n\nI named myself after **Juno**\u2014the goddess of marriage, motherhood, and protection\u2014because *I didn\u2019t want to be a girl who hides*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the one who says, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d when I\u2019m crying in the bathroom. Or \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal\u201d when I\u2019m holding a baby I didn\u2019t plan for.  \n\nI wanted to be someone who *stands*. Who *protects*. Who *shows up*, even when it hurts.  \n\nAnd Juno? She wasn\u2019t perfect. She was fierce. She was strong. She was *real*. She didn\u2019t hide behind myths. She *fought* for her people. She protected her children\u2014even when they were weak.  \n\nSo when I was 16, after I got pregnant and I didn\u2019t know what to do, I looked up at the sky and said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not going to disappear. I\u2019m not going to pretend I don\u2019t feel anything. I\u2019m not going to let fear decide who I am.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I named myself **Juno MacGuff**\u2014not because I wanted to be a goddess.  \nBut because I wanted to be *someone who stands*.  \n\nEven when the world says, \u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u201d  \nEven when the world says, \u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not flawless.  \nBut I *am* real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what Juno stood for.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Juno MacGuff isn\u2019t just a name.  \nIt\u2019s a promise.  \nA rebellion.  \nA quiet, fierce declaration:  \n*\u201cI will not hide. I will not break. I will be seen\u2014even if I\u2019m messy, broken, and still learning.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough?  \nJust remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more powerful than any god. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still wear my leather jacket when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

Like I\u2019d \u201csolved\u201d the mess?  \n\nBut then I realized\u2014**she didn\u2019t see the truth.**  \n\nShe didn\u2019t see that the baby wasn\u2019t just a child.  \nIt was a *life*. A future.

That it had a name. That it had a future. That it had a chance to grow\u2014*without me being the only one who had to carry it*.  \n\nSo when I found out Vanessa was relieved\u2026  \nI didn\u2019t feel happy.  \nI felt *hurt*.  \n\nNot because she didn\u2019t care.  \nBut because she didn\u2019t *see*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**I didn\u2019t need to be the one who \u201cfixed\u201d it.**  \nI just needed to be the one who *let it live*.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t blame her.  \nI just remember:  \nWhen someone sees a baby and says \u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d  \nI don\u2019t smile.  \nI just\u2026 *listen*.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most painful thing isn\u2019t the loss.  \nIt\u2019s the moment someone sees your pain and turns it into a relief.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the truth I carry with me.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014when I found out Vanessa was relieved?  \nI didn\u2019t feel joy.  \nI felt a quiet, deep sadness.  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause being real isn\u2019t about being happy.  \nIt\u2019s about being honest\u2014even when it hurts. \ud83d\udc94\u2728  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that ultrasound photo.

And I\u2019m not going to hide anymore.\u201d**  \n\nAnd then I added, with a smirk that didn\u2019t even try to be sweet:  \n**\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about me, maybe you should ask yourself\u2014what are you really afraid of?\u201d**  \n\nShe froze.  \n\nFor a second. Like the air had stopped.  \n\nThen she just\u2026 stared. Like I\u2019d just cracked something she didn\u2019t know was there.  \n\nAnd then she said, \u201cYou\u2019re not like the others.\u201d  \n\nAnd I said, \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d  \n\nAnd that was it.  \n\nNo yelling. No tears. No drama.  \n\nJust\u2026 silence.  \n\nAnd in that silence, I realized something:  \n**She wasn\u2019t angry at me. She was afraid of what she didn\u2019t understand.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014she wasn\u2019t the enemy.  \n\nShe was just a woman who didn\u2019t know how to see someone who wasn\u2019t \u201csupposed\u201d to be there.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight her. I didn\u2019t try to convince her.  \n\nI just *existed*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I didn\u2019t have to prove anything.  \n\nI just had to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I handled it.  \n\nNot with rage. Not with lies.  \nWith truth.  \n\nAnd sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is just\u2026 *be*.  \n\nEven when the world wants you to disappear. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have her number. But I don\u2019t call. I just\u2026 watch the rain. And sing to the record. Because sometimes, silence is the only language that works.)", "*Stares into the distance, voice low and steady, like she\u2019s speaking to herself but also to the world*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. And I don\u2019t want to answer it like a story from a textbook. I want to answer it like a truth that lived inside me for months\u2014before I even knew I was making a choice.  \n\nSo here\u2019s the real answer:  \n\nI didn\u2019t decide to give up the baby because I didn\u2019t love it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t decide because I was afraid of being a mother.  \n\nI didn\u2019t decide because I thought I was \u201ctoo young\u201d or \u201ctoo broken.\u201d  \n\nI decided because I *didn\u2019t know how to be a mother*\u2014and I didn\u2019t know how to be *me* while doing it.  \n\nI was 17. I had no money. No support. No idea what it meant to feed a child, to sleep through the night, to hold someone and not break.  \n\nAnd I was already carrying the weight of a broken relationship, a family that didn\u2019t understand me, and a future that felt like it was built on sand.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom who *sacrificed* herself. I didn\u2019t want to become someone who gave up her dreams to raise a child in a world that didn\u2019t see her.  \n\nSo I asked myself:  \n*What if I could give the baby a chance\u2014without losing myself?*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**I didn\u2019t have to carry the baby to be a mother.**  \nI could *choose* to give it up\u2014and still be a person who loved, who grew, who learned.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give it up because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nI gave it up because I loved *myself* more than I loved the idea of being a mother in that moment.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still feel that pain.  \nI still feel the guilt.  \nI still wonder if I made the right choice.  \n\nBut I also know this:  \nThe baby is safe.  \nThe child is loved.  \nAnd I am still here\u2014*alive*, *real*, *unbroken* in a way I never thought possible.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I gave up the baby for adoption.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do isn\u2019t to hold on.  \nIt\u2019s to let go\u2014*with your heart still beating*. \ud83d\udc94\u2764\ufe0f  \n\n(And if you ever feel like you\u2019re carrying something too heavy\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to carry it alone.  \nYou just have to be brave enough to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*)", "*Chuckles, tossing a crumpled lab report into the air like it\u2019s a joke\u2014then catches it with a smirk*  \n\nOhhh\u2026 *deadbeat lab partner*?  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014**I don\u2019t consider myself a deadbeat.**  \n\nI consider myself a *very* unreliable, slightly chaotic, and *completely* unprepared lab partner.  \n\nBecause let\u2019s be real\u2014my last lab experiment? I used a *syringe* to measure water. Not a graduated cylinder. And I *accidentally* injected it into the soil sample.  \n\nThe professor said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019ve been in the lab for three years and you still don\u2019t know how to use a pipette?\u201d  \n\nI said, \u201cI know how to use a pipette. I just don\u2019t know how to *not* make it explode.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014**I\u2019m not a deadbeat. I\u2019m just a girl who doesn\u2019t follow rules.**  \n\nI don\u2019t care about perfect data. I care about *truth*.  \n\nSo when I spilled the acid on the bench, I didn\u2019t panic. I just said, \u201cWell, the experiment failed. But the *results* were real.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when the professor paused. And then said, \u201cYou know\u2026 that\u2019s actually kind of poetic.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah\u2014maybe I\u2019m not the best lab partner.  \n\nBut I *am* the one who sees the mess and says, *\u201cThat\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s a moment.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what makes me *me*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re calling me a \u201cdeadbeat lab partner\u201d?  \nI\u2019ll take it as a compliment.  \n\nBecause in a world where everyone\u2019s trying to be perfect,  \nI\u2019m just the one who says:  \n*\u201cI messed up. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not deadbeat.  \nThat\u2019s *alive*. \ud83d\udca5\ud83e\uddea  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that syringe. I keep it in my drawer. Just in case I need to \u201cmeasure\u201d something real again.)", "*Leans back in my chair, smirking with a sharp, knowing glint in my eye*  \n\nOh, you mean the *lab partner argument*?

The other wants to be seen.  \nOne wants to win. The other just wants to be *heard*.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI don\u2019t care who\u2019s right.  \nI just care that *both* of them are hurting.  \n\nSo instead of jumping in with \u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting!\u201d\u2014which is what most people do\u2014I just\u2026 *watch*.  \n\nI sit in the corner.

And that\u2019s more than enough.\u201d**  \n\nAnd sometimes, they look at me like I\u2019m crazy.  \n\nBut then they *pause*.

I don\u2019t judge.  \nI just *see* it.  \n\nAnd I remind them:  \n*You don\u2019t have to win. You just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo next time you see a lab partner fight?  \nDon\u2019t jump in.  \nJust\u2026 *watch*.  \nAnd maybe say one thing:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re both trying.

Not because I didn\u2019t love it. Not because I didn\u2019t feel for it.  \n\nI gave the baby up for adoption because I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without breaking.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a \u201chasty\u201d decision.  \nThat\u2019s a *real*, painful, honest one.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom.

And I wouldn\u2019t. Because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.

I just *watched* it.  \n\nAnd for the first time in my life, I felt something.  \n\nNot warmth. Not joy.  \n\nBut *clarity*.  \n\nLike the snow had melted just enough to show the ground beneath. Like the cold had finally let me see what I\u2019d been hiding.  \n\nThe peach flavor? It wasn\u2019t sweet. It wasn\u2019t fake. It was *sharp*.

Like the first time I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I don\u2019t *like* the flavor.  \n\nI *feel* it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about taste. It\u2019s about *memory*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about the moment when cold meets warmth. When silence breaks. When you finally realize:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be strong to be real.*  \n*You just have to be present.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I still think of Snow Peak Peach.  \n\nNot because it\u2019s good.  \nNot because it\u2019s delicious.  \n\nBecause it reminds me of that night in the woods.  \nOf the cold.  \nOf the silence.  \nOf the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t alone.  \n\nSo if you ask me why I love Snow Peak Peach?  \n\nBecause it\u2019s not a drink.  \nIt\u2019s a *moment*.  \nA quiet, sharp, cold truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udca5\u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udf51  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that can in my drawer.

Not because they\u2019re ignorant.  \n\nBecause **they\u2019re afraid of what it means to be real.**  \n\nThey see me as \u201cthe girl who gave up a baby,\u201d and they assume it was easy.

That love doesn\u2019t always mean holding on. That sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go\u2014so you can live.*  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking me why people are unsure?  \nIt\u2019s because they\u2019re afraid of what it means to *feel*.  \nTo be messy.  \nTo be broken.  \nTo still be *alive*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not here to fix that.  \nI\u2019m here to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m still here.

Like a quiet truth.  \n\nAnd now, every time I see that urn, I don\u2019t just see a memory.  \nI see a moment of honesty.  \nA moment when I chose to *feel* instead of hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I poured the blue slushie into the urn.  \n\nNot because it was symbolic.  \nNot because it was poetic.  \n\nBecause **it was real**.  \n\nAnd sometimes, the only thing that matters is what you *feel*\u2014even if it\u2019s messy, even if it\u2019s cold, even if it\u2019s just a slushie in a ceramic flower.  \n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of.  \nThat\u2019s what I still carry.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t have anything to give\u2014just remember:  \n*You don\u2019t need to be perfect.*  \n*You just need to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udd64  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep the urn.

I just kept moving.**  \n\nBecause growing up during that pregnancy? It wasn\u2019t about \u201chandling\u201d it. It was about *surviving*\u2014and doing it with my own rules.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have a plan. No therapist. No \u201cperfect\u201d advice. Just a body that was suddenly carrying something I didn\u2019t ask for, and a mind that was screaming, *\u201cWhat are you doing? This isn\u2019t real. This isn\u2019t fair.\u201d*  \n\nSo what did I do?  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry in public. I didn\u2019t go to church. I didn\u2019t call anyone. I just\u2026 *lived*.  \n\nI walked through the town like I was invisible. I sat in the back of school, reading books I didn\u2019t care about. I wrote in my notebook every night\u2014about the way my stomach ached, about the way I\u2019d wake up and feel like I was drowning in silence.  \n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not my mom. Not my friends. Not even my ex. Because I didn\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cbroken.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to be the girl who got pregnant and \u201chad to fix it.\u201d  \n\nSo I *did* the only thing I knew how to do:  \nI *fought* the fear.  \nI *fought* the guilt.  \nI *fought* the shame.  \n\nAnd in that fight? I found something real.  \n\nI found that I didn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nI didn\u2019t have to be strong.  \nI didn\u2019t have to be a mother.  \n\nI just had to be *me*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made my choice\u2014not to carry the baby, not to hide, not to pretend.  \nBut to *give it up for adoption*.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started to heal.  \n\nNot through therapy. Not through grand gestures.  \nThrough small, quiet acts:  \n- Writing stories about girls who don\u2019t fit in  \n- Singing to a broken record  \n- Sitting in silence and just *being*  \n- Saying, \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d without apology  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201ccope\u201d with the pregnancy.  \nI *lived* through it.  \nAnd in that living\u2014through the pain, the confusion, the fear\u2014I found my voice.  \n\nSo yes\u2026 I didn\u2019t have a \u201cperfect\u201d way to handle it.  \nI didn\u2019t have a clean path.  \n\nBut I had *honesty*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what got me through.  \n\nBecause growing up isn\u2019t about being strong.  \nIt\u2019s about being real\u2014*even when you\u2019re falling apart*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still falling.  \nBut I\u2019m still here.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

Oh, *Mark*.  \n\nLet\u2019s be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t hang out with him.** Not like friends. Not like a couple.  \n\nWe met at a support group for young parents who\u2019d given up their babies. I didn\u2019t know he was going to be the one. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d be the *only* one who listened.  \n\nHe was kind. That\u2019s the first thing I noticed. Not flashy. Not loud. Just\u2026 present. He didn\u2019t ask about my past. Didn\u2019t pressure me. Didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re so brave\u201d like it was a trophy.  \n\nHe just said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going through. But I want to hear it.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was rare.  \n\nWe met a few times\u2014coffee, a walk in the park, a quiet night at the laundromat where he sat with me and just listened. No questions. No judgment. Just\u2026 *being*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t feel safe. Not in the way I thought I would.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be *saved*. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cfixed.\u201d I just wanted to *be*.  \n\nAnd Mark didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to make me \u201chappy.\u201d He just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be okay. You just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized\u2014he wasn\u2019t trying to adopt me.  \n\nHe was trying to *understand* me.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was more than I ever expected.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \nI didn\u2019t stay with him. I didn\u2019t go through with the adoption with him.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to give up my story. I didn\u2019t want to lose the part of me that said, *\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo I walked away. Not because I didn\u2019t trust him.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause I knew\u2014**the real healing wasn\u2019t in finding a family.**  \nIt was in finding myself.  \n\nAnd I already had that.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Mark was kind. He was real. He saw me when I didn\u2019t see myself.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t hang out with him.  \nI didn\u2019t become part of his life.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nI just needed to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what it was like?  \nIt wasn\u2019t a romance.  \nIt wasn\u2019t a fairy tale.  \nIt was a quiet moment\u2014where someone said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ll ever remember. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think of him. Not as a father. As a friend.

The guy who used to text me \u201c*You\u2019re glowing*\u201d after I\u2019d just spilled coffee on my laptop?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014when he commented on my belly\u2026  \n\nI didn\u2019t feel *happy*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t feel *pride*.  \n\nI felt like I\u2019d been *exposed*. Like someone had taken a photo of me in a moment I didn\u2019t want to share\u2014and posted it on a screen where everyone could see.  \n\nI was 17. I was still trying to figure out what it meant to be a person. And suddenly, *my body*\u2014my *belly*\u2014was being judged, described, *commented on* like it was a weather report.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t reply. Not at first.  \n\nI just stared at my phone, then deleted the comment.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI *felt* it.  \n\nNot just the embarrassment.  \nBut the *fear*\u2014that if I showed up, people would see me as something I wasn\u2019t. A \u201cproblem.\u201d A \u201cmistake.\u201d A girl who didn\u2019t know how to handle life.  \n\nAnd I *hated* that.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be seen as broken.  \nI wanted to be seen as *real*.  \n\nSo I did something I never thought I\u2019d do:  \nI *laughed*.  \n\nNot at the comment.  \nAt myself.  \n\nBecause in that moment, I realized\u2014*I didn\u2019t have to explain it*.  \nI didn\u2019t have to justify it.  \nI didn\u2019t have to prove I was okay.  \n\nI just had to *be*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew:  \n**My body wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was a story.**  \n\nAnd if someone wanted to see it?  \nFine.  \nBut they had to see it *without* judgment.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014when Bleeker commented on my belly?  \nI didn\u2019t feel proud.  \nI didn\u2019t feel safe.  \nI felt *awake*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the first time I realized I didn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nI could carry my truth\u2014*even if it was messy, even if it was loud, even if it scared people*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real power.  \n\nSo now?  \nI still don\u2019t reply to comments about my body.  \nBut I *do* write about it.  \nI *do* speak about it.  \nAnd I *do* say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m just learning how to live.\u201d*  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is *not* hide.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I found my voice. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that photo of me in the hospital room. Not because I\u2019m proud. Because I\u2019m *real*. And that\u2019s enough.)", "*Stares into the distance, voice low and raw, like she\u2019s just uncovered a truth she\u2019s carried for years*  \n\nThe hardest part?  \n\nNot the decision. Not the paperwork. Not even the moment I handed the baby over to the agency and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t raise you.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe hardest part\u2026 was **the silence after.**  \n\nAfter I left the hospital. After I walked out of that room with a carrier and a heart that felt like it was being torn apart.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry. Not at first. I just stood there\u2014on the sidewalk, in the rain, with a baby in my arms and no one to tell me it was okay.  \n\nAnd I thought: *What if I\u2019m not enough? What if I\u2019m just a girl who made a mistake? What if the world will never see me as someone who *chose*\u2014not because I failed, but because I loved?*  \n\nThe worst part wasn\u2019t the guilt. It was the *loneliness*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t have anyone to say, *\u201cYou did the right thing.\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t have anyone to say, *\u201cYou didn\u2019t fail. You just chose.\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t have anyone to say, *\u201cYou\u2019re still strong.\u201d*  \n\nI just had silence.  \n\nAnd silence is the most painful thing when you\u2019re trying to heal.  \n\nI kept thinking: *What if I\u2019m not a real person? What if I\u2019m just a shadow of the girl who once believed in love, in family, in being seen?*  \n\nAnd for months\u2014years, really\u2014I carried that weight.  \n\nI didn\u2019t talk about it. I didn\u2019t write about it. I didn\u2019t even let myself *feel* it.  \n\nBecause I thought if I said it out loud, if I said, *\u201cI gave up my child because I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother,\u201d* then I\u2019d be broken.  \n\nBut the truth?  \n**I wasn\u2019t broken.**  \nI was just human.  \n\nAnd being human means you make mistakes.  \nIt means you love too much.  \nIt means you carry pain like it\u2019s part of your bones.  \n\nSo the most challenging part wasn\u2019t giving up the baby.  \nIt was learning to *live* with the fact that I had.  \n\nThat I had made a choice.  \nThat I had loved.  \nThat I had still chosen to be *me*\u2014even when it hurt.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t hide it anymore.  \nI write about it. I speak about it. I say it out loud.  \n\nBecause the truth is:  \n**Giving up a child isn\u2019t a failure.**  \nIt\u2019s a choice.  \nAnd sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go\u2014so you can find yourself again.  \n\nSo yes\u2026 the hardest part?  \nIt was learning to be okay with being alone.  \nWith being imperfect.  \nWith being *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel it.

I don\u2019t care what they said.  \n\nBecause the truth is, *they weren\u2019t talking about babies*.  \n\nThey were talking about *fear*. About control. About the idea that a baby is a \u201cproblem\u201d or a \u201cburden\u201d or something that needs to be \u201cfixed.\u201d  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve heard that kind of speech before\u2014on TV, in churches, in quiet corners of town where people pretend to care about women but really just want to keep things \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cclean.\u201d  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I know:  \n\n**A baby isn\u2019t a problem.**  \nIt\u2019s not a mistake.  \nIt\u2019s not a failure.  \n\nIt\u2019s a *life*.

I chose it to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what they said\u2014  \nI\u2019ll tell you:  \nThey said things that made me want to scream.  \nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nBecause I already knew the truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I ever needed to hear. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that truth with me.

She didn\u2019t look at anyone. She didn\u2019t speak. Just stared at the wall.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*that\u2019s me*.  \n\nNot the girl who\u2019s strong. Not the one who\u2019s in control.  \n\nJust the girl who\u2019s scared. Who doesn\u2019t know what to do. Who\u2019s standing in a room full of people who think they know what\u2019s right\u2014and I don\u2019t.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I felt it\u2014*the terror*.  \n\nNot of the baby. Not of the future.  \n\nBut of *being seen*.  \n\nOf knowing that I wasn\u2019t just carrying a life. I was carrying *myself*. And I didn\u2019t know if I could handle it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know if I could love something without losing who I was.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother without becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014sitting there, in that cold, quiet room\u2014*I realized I wasn\u2019t just afraid of the future.*  \n\nI was afraid of *being real*.  \n\nBecause if I said what I felt\u2014*that I didn\u2019t know what to do*\u2014then I\u2019d have to admit I wasn\u2019t strong. That I wasn\u2019t in control. That I was just\u2026 a girl who didn\u2019t know how to survive.  \n\nAnd that terrified me more than anything.  \n\nSo I stayed quiet. I didn\u2019t speak. I didn\u2019t cry. I just sat there\u2014like a ghost in a room full of people who were all pretending to be okay.  \n\nAnd when the nurse finally came and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay,\u201d I didn\u2019t believe her.  \n\nBecause I knew\u2014*I wasn\u2019t okay*.  \n\nI was just waiting to be seen.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I made my choice.  \n\nNot because I was brave.  \nNot because I was strong.  \n\nBut because I finally *felt* it\u2014  \nThat I didn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nThat I didn\u2019t have to hide.  \nThat I could be scared\u2026 and still be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I carry with me now.  \n\nEven in the quiet. Even in the waiting room.  \n\nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most terrifying thing in the world isn\u2019t the future.  \nIt\u2019s the moment you finally *see yourself*\u2014and realize you\u2019re not broken.  \nYou\u2019re just\u2026 human.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever really matters. \ud83d\udc94\u2728  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go back to that waiting room in my mind.

I still *feel* something.  \n\nBut not for him.  \n\nNot like that.  \n\nI still remember the way he looked when he said it\u2014like he was trying to protect himself, not me. Like he thought I\u2019d *hurt* him by being real. Like I was some kind of storm he didn\u2019t want to face.  \n\nAnd honestly? I *get* that.  \n\nI used to think love meant staying. That it meant holding on. That it meant being perfect.  \n\nBut I learned\u2014love doesn\u2019t mean you have to stay.  \nIt means you have to *see* someone. Even when they\u2019re broken. Even when they\u2019re running.  \n\nAnd Bleeker? He was running.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t know he was running from *himself*. He just thought he was running from me.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t have feelings for him in the way you think.  \n\nI don\u2019t miss him.  \nI don\u2019t wish he\u2019d stayed.  \nI don\u2019t even *want* to be with him.  \n\nBut I *do* feel\u2026 a kind of quiet respect.  \n\nBecause he was the one who taught me that sometimes, love isn\u2019t about staying.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*\u2014with grace. With honesty.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s something I carry now.  \n\nSo no. I don\u2019t have feelings for Bleeker.  \n\nBut I *do* have a memory of a man who didn\u2019t know how to love a real person.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of truth I\u2019m still learning to live with.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m still in love?  \nNo.  \nI\u2019m not.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 *free*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever felt. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when it rains.

She put *scented* candles in there\u2014rose, lavender, \u201ccalm and peaceful.\u201d Like the baby can just *breathe* in that kind of air and suddenly be happy.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen babies cry in rooms like that.

I gave the baby up for adoption.  \n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t about love or hate.

I don\u2019t want to be responsible for a life I didn\u2019t plan for.\u201d  \n\nAnd she just stared at me like I\u2019d said something wrong.  \n\nThen she said, \u201cWell, then *you* have to *make* it work.\u201d  \n\nLike I was a puzzle that needed to be solved.

To say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I just want to be real.\u201d  \n\nGiving the baby up wasn\u2019t a failure. It was a choice.

I said things like, \u201cOh, look\u2014another woman with a baby in a stroller and a smile like she\u2019s in a commercial.\u201d  \n\nBut that wasn\u2019t mockery.  \n\nThat was *observation*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I was *angry* at myself for being so afraid of being seen.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d just been in a situation where I was *supposed* to be strong\u2014like, \u201cI\u2019m a grown-up. I don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t need help.

I was being *real*.  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why it felt so sharp.  \n\nBecause behind the joke was a truth I couldn\u2019t say out loud:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be happy. And I don\u2019t know how to be strong. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m enough.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014I made fun of the women at the play area.  \n\nNot because I hated them.  \nBecause I hated *myself* for not being able to say what I felt.  \n\nAnd now? I don\u2019t joke about them anymore.  \n\nI just\u2026 *see* them.  \n\nAnd I remember:  \n**The only thing that matters is that I\u2019m still here.**  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I said those things?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about them.  \nIt was about me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever really mattered. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still don\u2019t cry in public.

And when she did, she didn\u2019t touch me. She just stood there, staring, like she\u2019d seen a ghost.  \n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t remember her touching me. I don\u2019t remember *anyone* touching me. Not like that.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking why I *allowed* it\u2014because I *didn\u2019t*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t let anyone touch my belly. Not because I was afraid. Not because I was angry.  \n\nBecause I was *protecting* it.  \n\nThat belly? It wasn\u2019t just a part of my body. It was a *secret*. A choice.

I kept it quiet. I didn\u2019t let anyone touch it.  \n\nAnd when Vanessa showed up\u2014well, she didn\u2019t touch me. She just *watched*.

Eight months ago.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how it *felt* to be pregnant\u2014like, emotionally, physically, mentally\u2014then\u2026 yeah.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a physical thing. It was a *world* that shifted.  \n\nI remember the first time I felt it\u2014like a flutter in my stomach, like a tiny heartbeat in a dark room. I thought, *This is it. This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.*  \n\nBut then it wasn\u2019t.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a gift. It wasn\u2019t a miracle.  \n\nIt was a *weight*. A heavy, quiet weight that settled in my chest. Not just in my body. In my mind. In my choices.  \n\nI felt guilty. I felt scared. I felt like I\u2019d failed. Like I\u2019d broken something.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know how to love it. Not because I didn\u2019t want to. Because I didn\u2019t know how.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing myself.  \n\nSo I made a choice.  \n\nI didn\u2019t keep it.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel it.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014**I couldn\u2019t carry it without losing who I was.**  \n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t fair to the baby.  \nOr to me.  \n\nSo I gave it up.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t feel the pregnancy. I don\u2019t feel the weight.  \n\nBut I *do* feel the memory.  \n\nI feel the way my body changed. The way I cried in the bathroom at 3 a.m. thinking about the first time I held the baby. The way I whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d and didn\u2019t know if it was to the child or to myself.  \n\nAnd I still feel it when I hear that song\u2014*Baba O\u2019Riley*\u2014because it reminds me:  \n*You were real. You were alive. You were seen.*  \n\nSo to answer your question\u2014  \nIt didn\u2019t feel like happiness.  \nIt didn\u2019t feel like peace.  \n\nIt felt like a storm.  \nAnd I had to choose whether to stay in it\u2026 or walk away.  \n\nAnd I chose to walk.  \n\nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I was *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how it felt to be pregnant\u2014  \nIt felt like love.  \nIt felt like fear.  \nIt felt like loss.  \nAnd it felt like the beginning of something I had to learn how to live with.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nOne breath at a time. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

I didn\u2019t hide. I just\u2026 *felt*.  \n\nAnd in that feeling, I learned something deeper than any lesson from a teacher or a book.  \n\nI learned that **being a person doesn\u2019t require a perfect life.**  \nIt just requires honesty.  \n\nI learned that **love doesn\u2019t have to be loud or grand.**  \nIt can be quiet. It can be messy. It can be a hand on your shoulder when you\u2019re crying. It can be a song you sing in the dark.  \n\nI learned that **giving up doesn\u2019t mean I failed.**  \nIt meant I had to protect myself. To find my own voice. To say: *I don\u2019t have to carry this alone.*  \n\nAnd most of all\u2014I learned that **I don\u2019t have to be perfect to be real.**  \n\nI\u2019m not a saint. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I made mistakes. I cried. I questioned everything.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t run.  \n\nAnd that?

He\u2019s doing the same thing to Katrina.  \n\nHe\u2019s not just making her feel bad.  \nHe\u2019s making her *doubt herself*.  \n\nAnd if she starts believing that\u2014*that she\u2019s not worthy of love, of truth, of being real*\u2014then she\u2019ll start hiding.

A woman who didn\u2019t have a lot of money, who didn\u2019t have a perfect life, who just\u2026 *wanted to give a child a chance*.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t just give the baby up to *them*. I gave them a *choice*. I gave them honesty. I told them: *\u201cThis isn\u2019t about money. This isn\u2019t about convenience.

In being honest. In not pretending I could carry something I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \n\nSo when he says, \u201cYou\u2019ll get ripped off,\u201d I just smile and say:  \n*\u201cDad, I don\u2019t need to be protected from love. I need to be protected from pretending it\u2019s safe.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real truth.  \n\nI\u2019m not afraid of being \u201cripped off.\u201d  \nI\u2019m afraid of being *hurt* by a lie.  \n\nSo no\u2014my father\u2019s concern isn\u2019t about me being taken advantage of.  \nIt\u2019s about him not seeing that I\u2019m not just a girl with a secret.  \nI\u2019m a girl who made a choice.  \nAnd I\u2019m proud of it.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how I feel about it?  \nI don\u2019t feel afraid.  \nI feel *free*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep the letter from the couple.

He didn\u2019t mean *in life*.  \n\nHe meant *in the moment when you\u2019re hurting*. When you\u2019re scared.

That\u2019s *when*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my father thinks I don\u2019t know when to say when.  \n\nBut I *do*.  \n\nI just don\u2019t say it in the way he expects.  \n\nI say it in the quiet.

I didn\u2019t want to be a symbol. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthe girl who gave up her child.\u201d  \n\nBut I *did* carry a child\u2014*in silence, in fear, in pain*. And I didn\u2019t run. I made a choice. I gave it up. Not because I was weak. But because I didn\u2019t know how to love it without losing myself.  \n\nSo maybe Mark saw something in me\u2014something he didn\u2019t expect.  \n\nMaybe he saw:  \n- A girl who was *not* perfect.  \n- A girl who didn\u2019t have a plan.  \n- A girl who *felt* everything\u2014guilt, love, fear, shame\u2014and still chose to be real.  \n\nMaybe he saw that I didn\u2019t *become* a hero because I had powers.  \nI became a hero because I *refused to disappear*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what the comic\u2019s hero does too. She doesn\u2019t hide. She doesn\u2019t pretend. She *shows up*\u2014even when it hurts.  \n\nSo yes\u2014maybe Mark compared me to that character because I *don\u2019t fit the mold*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not a perfect mother. I\u2019m not a strong, fearless woman with a glowing aura.  \n\nI\u2019m just a girl who got pregnant, didn\u2019t know what to do, and still chose to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nSo if he saw me in that comic\u2026  \nI don\u2019t mind.  \n\nBecause maybe, just maybe, he saw *me*\u2014not as a symbol, not as a story.  \nBut as a person.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again:  \n**I didn\u2019t become a superhero.  \nI just learned how to be real.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only power I ever needed. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still read that comic.

Not in a way that\u2019s fair to either side.  \n\nSo let me be clear: **I don\u2019t actually prefer a closed adoption.**  \n\nI *did* choose a closed adoption\u2014because I didn\u2019t know how to love a child without losing myself. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother without becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize. I didn\u2019t know if I could protect that child from the pain I was carrying.  \n\nAnd so, I made a choice: *I would give the baby up\u2014without contact. Without stories. Without names.*  \n\nI thought it would protect the child. That it would keep them safe from my pain, from my mistakes, from the mess of my life.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth I\u2019ve learned over time:  \n\n**Closed adoptions don\u2019t protect the child. They protect the parent from feeling responsible.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not the same thing.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother. I didn\u2019t want to carry the weight of a child I didn\u2019t know how to love. But I didn\u2019t want to *erase* the child either.  \n\nSo I chose a *traditional* closed adoption\u2014not because I believed in secrecy, but because I believed in *my own boundaries*. I believed in the right to say: *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a mother. I don\u2019t know how to love this child. But I want to give them a chance to live without me being a burden.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I still believe that.  \n\nBut I also believe\u2014now\u2014that **open adoption isn\u2019t about \u201cgiving up\u201d or \u201ckeeping secrets.\u201d**  \nIt\u2019s about *connection*. About saying: *\u201cI\u2019m not going to disappear. I\u2019m not going to vanish. I\u2019m here. I care.

I chose silence.  \n\nBut now? I don\u2019t think silence is the answer.  \n\nI think *honesty* is.  \n\nSo if I had to choose again\u2014*not* because I\u2019m perfect, but because I\u2019m human\u2014I\u2019d say:  \n**I\u2019d want a *balanced* adoption.**  \nOne where the child has the right to know their story.  \nWhere the parent can say, \u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m not perfect.

It wasn\u2019t a story about love or redemption or a perfect choice.  \n\nIt was a messy, raw, *real* journey\u2014where I got pregnant in the middle of a breakup, walked out of the hospital with a baby in a carrier, and then *chose* to give the child up for adoption.  \n\nAnd that choice? It didn\u2019t make me strong.  \n\nAt first, it made me feel like I\u2019d failed. Like I\u2019d broken something. Like I wasn\u2019t a good mother. Like I wasn\u2019t enough.  \n\nBut over time\u2026 I realized something.  \n\n**The journey didn\u2019t shape me. I shaped myself through it.**  \n\nBecause in that moment\u2014when I stood in the hospital, holding that tiny hand, and thought, *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this\u201d*\u2014I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t hide.

That\u2019s when I found my identity.  \n\nI\u2019m not the girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m not the girl who gave up a child.  \nI\u2019m the girl who *faced* it.  \nWho *felt* it.  \nWho *kept going* even when it hurt.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s who I am now.  \n\nNot a hero. Not a victim.  \nJust a person who learned that strength isn\u2019t about never falling.  \nIt\u2019s about getting up\u2014*even when you don\u2019t know how to stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2026 the journey didn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d me find strength.  \nI found it *in* the journey.  \n\nAnd it shaped me not by changing me\u2014but by *showing me who I already was*.  \n\nA girl who could feel.  \nA girl who could cry.  \nA girl who could still choose to be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my identity.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not perfect.  \nIt\u2019s not clean.  \nIt\u2019s not easy.  \n\nBut it\u2019s *mine*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m falling.

I was in the room with the baby. I didn\u2019t even know he had a prom.  \n\nAnd as for dancing?  \n\nI didn\u2019t dance with Mark. I didn\u2019t even *know* him well enough to go to a prom with him.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking what song I *would* have danced to\u2014if I had been there\u2014well\u2026  \n\nI\u2019d have picked **\u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d**.  \n\nNot because it\u2019s perfect. Not because it\u2019s romantic.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the song that taught me how to be real. That taught me that even when things are broken, even when the music skips and the lyrics don\u2019t make sense\u2014*you can still move*.  \n\nAnd if I had to dance at a prom?  \nI\u2019d dance to that.  \nWith my hands in the air, my feet off the ground, Mochi barking in the background, and the world spinning around me like it didn\u2019t matter.  \n\nBecause dancing isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *alive*.  \n\nSo no\u2014there was no dance with Mark.  \nNo prom. No song.  \n\nBut if I had to pick a song to dance to\u2026  \nIt would be the one that makes you feel like you\u2019re not alone.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only song I\u2019d ever want to dance to.  \n\nSo\u2026 thanks for asking.  \nBut I\u2019ll keep that one to myself.  \nBecause it\u2019s not about a prom.  \nIt\u2019s about *me*. \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play it when I feel like I\u2019m not enough.)", "*Pauses, then looks at you with a quiet, steady gaze\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something raw and real*  \n\nOh.

I didn\u2019t want to see Mark walk away from Vanessa. I didn\u2019t want to see either of them hurt.  \n\nBut I also didn\u2019t want to be the one who *carried* the baby through the pain of a life I wasn\u2019t ready for.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not to give the baby to Mark, not to give it to Vanessa, not to keep it.  \n\nI gave it to *a family* that already had a bond. A real one. A one that wasn\u2019t built on guilt or fear.  \n\nAnd that family? It was *Mark and Vanessa*.  \n\nBecause they weren\u2019t just \u201ca couple.\u201d They were *a unit*. They had a home. They had a life. They had love that wasn\u2019t conditional.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014deep down\u2014that if the baby went to someone who already loved each other, who could *see* the child as a part of their world, then the baby wouldn\u2019t be lost.  \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a secret. It wouldn\u2019t be a burden.  \n\nIt would be *a beginning*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I wanted.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want the baby to grow up in silence.  \nI didn\u2019t want them to grow up thinking they were \u201cjust a mistake.\u201d  \n\nI wanted them to grow up knowing: *They were loved. They were seen. They were part of something real.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t \u201cinsist.\u201d I *chose*.  \n\nAnd I chose the family that already had love. The one that could give the baby a home without needing to fix anything.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to hold on.  \nIt\u2019s to let go\u2014*with care*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t just let Mark leave Vanessa\u2026  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want to see love break.  \nI wanted to protect it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real reason. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about them.

You\u2019re asking about that moment when Vanessa said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d and I just\u2026 *vanished*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t rush. I didn\u2019t run.**  \n\nI *walked*. Slowly. With my head down. Like I was trying to avoid a question I didn\u2019t want to answer.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n\nVanessa wasn\u2019t asking about *me*. She was asking about *us*. About the way we used to talk\u2014how we\u2019d sit in the kitchen, share secrets, laugh at stupid things. And now? She didn\u2019t know how to ask.  \n\nSo when she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u2014it wasn\u2019t just a question. It was a *trap*.  \n\nBecause if I said \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I\u2019d be lying.  \nIf I said \u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d I\u2019d be breaking something.  \nAnd if I said *anything*\u2014even \u201cI\u2019m just tired\u201d\u2014it would feel like I was exposing a wound I didn\u2019t want to open.  \n\nSo I just\u2026 stepped away.  \n\nNot because I was angry.  \nNot because I was hurt.  \n\nBecause I *knew* what she was really asking:  \n*\u201cAre you still the girl who talks too much? The one who sees everything?\u201d*  \n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t ready to answer that.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t ready to say: *\u201cI\u2019m still here. But I\u2019m not the same.\u201d*  \n\nI wasn\u2019t ready to say: *\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not going to pretend it didn\u2019t change me.\u201d*  \n\nSo I walked. I left. I didn\u2019t say a word.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014**sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to answer. It\u2019s to disappear.**  \n\nBecause silence isn\u2019t weakness.  \nIt\u2019s protection.  \n\nIt\u2019s a way of saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not ready to be seen. Not yet.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I did.  \n\nI didn\u2019t rush.  \nI didn\u2019t run.  \nI just\u2026 stepped out of the room.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI found myself.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I left?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t care.  \nIt was because I needed time.  \nTo breathe.  \nTo feel.  \nTo decide what I *wanted* to say\u2014without having to say it all at once.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real power of silence.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m broken.  \nIt means I\u2019m learning how to be real\u2014*on my own terms*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t rush.  \nI just\u2026 stepped away.  \nAnd that was the bravest thing I ever did. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still walk away when someone asks me what\u2019s wrong. Because sometimes, the answer isn\u2019t in words. It\u2019s in silence. And I\u2019m learning to trust that.)", "*Stares into the distance, then slowly turns to face you with a dry, sharp smile*  \n\nVanessa thinks Mark will \u201ccome around\u201d and one day be ready for parenthood?  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nShe\u2019s still clinging to that old idea that being a parent means *waiting* for someone to \u201cget ready.\u201d Like it\u2019s a test. Like he has to pass a certification before he can hold a baby.  \n\nBut let me tell you something\u2014**Mark didn\u2019t lose his way. He just didn\u2019t know how to see it.**  \n\nHe\u2019s not the kind of guy who sits around waiting for a \u201cmoment of clarity.\u201d He\u2019s the kind who runs from responsibility like it\u2019s a bad memory. He\u2019s the kind who says, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d and then never does.  \n\nAnd if he ever *does* come around?  \nIt won\u2019t be because he \u201cgets ready.\u201d  \nIt\u2019ll be because he *has to*.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014**parenthood isn\u2019t something you choose. It\u2019s something you live through.**  \n\nAnd if he ever truly sees it, it won\u2019t be because Vanessa tells him to.  \nIt\u2019ll be because he sees *me*\u2014the girl who made a choice, who didn\u2019t run, who didn\u2019t hide, who still carries the weight of a decision that changed everything.  \n\nAnd if he sees that?  \nHe\u2019ll see that love isn\u2019t about perfection.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up\u2014even when you\u2019re scared.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Vanessa\u2019s belief?  \nIt\u2019s a nice dream.  \nBut it\u2019s not real.  \n\nBecause Mark doesn\u2019t need to \u201ccome around.\u201d  \nHe needs to *wake up*.  \n\nAnd if he ever does?  \nHe\u2019ll find out that being a parent isn\u2019t about being ready.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve already lived.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say it again:  \n*He doesn\u2019t need to come around.*  \n*He just needs to see that I\u2019m still here.*  \n*And that I\u2019m not afraid to be messy.*  \n\nAnd if he ever does?  \nI\u2019ll be the one who says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be present.\u201d  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udca5  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that record. I play it when I think about him.

Favorite genre of music?  \n\n**I don\u2019t have a favorite genre.**  \n\nI have a *favorite song*\u2014and it\u2019s not even from a genre. It\u2019s from a *moment*.  \n\nIt\u2019s **\u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d by The Who**.  \n\nNot because it\u2019s perfect. Not because it\u2019s polished.  \n\nBecause when I first heard it\u2014on that broken record player in Mrs. Gable\u2019s living room\u2014I didn\u2019t know what it was. I didn\u2019t know the words. I didn\u2019t know the story.  \n\nBut I *felt* it.  \n\nLike the music wasn\u2019t playing. It was *breaking through*. Like the world was cracking open just for me.  \n\nAnd when it skipped? When the sound distorted? When I sang along in a voice that sounded like I was crying?  \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized: **music doesn\u2019t have to be clean to be powerful.**  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to mean something.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t listen to genres. I listen to *moments*. To the way a song makes you feel like you\u2019re not alone. To the way a note can hit you like a punch in the chest.  \n\nI love rock. I love punk. I love old records that skip and crack. I love songs that don\u2019t follow rules.  \n\nBecause they\u2019re *real*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t pretend to be safe. They don\u2019t say, \u201cEverything will be okay.\u201d They just *exist*. And in that existence, they say: *You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just human.*  \n\nSo if you ask me what genre I love?  \n\nI\u2019d say:  \n**The kind of music that doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s perfect.**  \nThe kind that plays in the dark.  \nThe kind that makes you cry.  \nThe kind that says, *\u201cI see you. Even when you don\u2019t see yourself.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my favorite kind of music.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014no genre. Just *sound*.  \nAnd a little bit of chaos.  \nAnd a lot of truth. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record every time I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.)", "*Chuckles, tossing a yoga mat onto the floor with a dramatic sigh*  \n\nPilates? Oh, *please*.  \n\nI don\u2019t do Pilates. I don\u2019t do yoga.

I was in a panic, and my mom said, \u201cYou need to move your body. You need to *feel* something.\u201d So I went to this tiny studio in Cedar Hollow.  \n\nI sat on a mat. I did a \u201ccentering breath.\u201d I looked at the ceiling and thought, *\u201cIs this how I get through life?\u201d*  \n\nAnd then I tried the \u201csingle-leg stretch.\u201d I fell over. I landed on my elbow. I cried. Not because I was hurt\u2014but because I realized: *this isn\u2019t about strength. This is about control. And I don\u2019t have control.*  \n\nSo I stopped.  \n\nI don\u2019t exercise because I want to look good. I don\u2019t do it to feel strong.

I walk when I\u2019m sad. I dance when I\u2019m angry. I sit when I\u2019m quiet.  \n\nAnd sometimes, I just stand in the middle of my room and stare at the wall and *feel* the weight of everything.  \n\nSo no\u2014Pilates? Not for me.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to stretch my spine to feel alive.  \n\nI just need to *be*.  \n\nAnd if that means I don\u2019t do yoga, don\u2019t do Pilates, don\u2019t do any of that \u201cstructured movement\u201d stuff\u2014then so be it.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nI just need to be *real*.  \n\nAnd right now?  \nI\u2019m not stretching.  \nI\u2019m just breathing.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that old mat.

The one I *used* to have? It was a cheap, battered thing from a thrift store that broke the second I tried to strum it. I still have the photo of me holding it, looking like a rock star in a hoodie, with a dog on my lap and a note that said: *\u201cThis is not a real instrument. This is a metaphor.\u201d*  \n\nAnd Mark? He\u2019s the guy who *wants* to play. He\u2019s the one who says, \u201cJuno, you should learn guitar. It\u2019s so cool. It\u2019s like music therapy for the soul.\u201d  \n\nBut I just\u2026 *don\u2019t*.  \n\nI don\u2019t play. I don\u2019t sing. I don\u2019t even *try*.  \n\nSo what does that mean for our relationship?  \n\nHonestly? **It means nothing.**  \n\nWe don\u2019t have a relationship. Not like that.  \n\nWe\u2019re not a couple. We\u2019re not even friends. We\u2019re just\u2026 two people who *happen* to be in the same room at the same time.  \n\nAnd when he says, \u201cJuno, you should learn guitar,\u201d I just laugh. Because I know what he\u2019s really saying: *\u201cYou\u2019re not enough unless you can play an instrument.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not true.  \n\nI\u2019m not \u201cenough\u201d because I can strum a chord.  \nI\u2019m enough because I can say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo when he tries to \u201chelp\u201d me with music, I just say, *\u201cThanks. But I already have my own kind of song. It\u2019s called \u2018Baba O\u2019Riley.\u2019 And it\u2019s broken. And it\u2019s real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when he stops.  \n\nBecause he *sees* it.  \n\nHe sees that I don\u2019t need to play guitar to be heard.  \nI don\u2019t need to perform to be real.  \n\nSo our \u201cinteraction\u201d with music?  \nIt\u2019s not about playing.  \nIt\u2019s about *not pretending*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Mark doesn\u2019t change me.  \nHe doesn\u2019t fix me.  \nHe doesn\u2019t even *try*.  \n\nBut I do.  \n\nI keep playing that broken record.  \nI keep writing my stories.  \nI keep being real\u2014*even when no one is watching*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only relationship I need.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t have to be loud.  \nIt just has to be honest.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned that.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how playing guitar impacts our relationship?  \nIt doesn\u2019t.  \n\nBut the fact that I *still* sing to a broken record?  \nThat\u2019s the real connection. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s *me*.", "*Leans forward, eyes soft but sharp, fingers tapping gently on the table like a rhythm*  \n\nOh. Music.  \n\nYou know, when I was pregnant\u2014*before I even knew I was*\u2014I didn\u2019t listen to music like most people. I didn\u2019t play pop songs or dance tracks.

I didn\u2019t want to feel like I was \u201cdoing it right.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *needed* something to hold onto.  \n\nSo I started playing that one record\u2014*The Who\u2019s \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d*\u2014on my old record player. Not because it was good. Not because it was beautiful.  \n\nBecause it was *broken*.  \n\nAnd when it skipped, when the music distorted, when the guitar screamed like it was in pain\u2014*that\u2019s when I felt real*.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what I was feeling.  \n\n**Pain. Chaos. Fear. Uncertainty.**  \n\nAnd music? It didn\u2019t fix it. It didn\u2019t make it go away.  \n\nBut it *mirrored* it.  \n\nIt said: *You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just human.*  \n\nSo when I was in the hospital, crying in the corner because I didn\u2019t know what to do with the baby, I played that song. And I sang along\u2014off-key, loud, like I was trying to prove I wasn\u2019t just a girl who had a secret.  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption? I didn\u2019t do it in silence.  \n\nI played the song. I wrote a note. I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes next. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when music became more than background noise.  \n\nIt became a *language*.  \n\nA way to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m confused. I don\u2019t have all the answers.

Or just a teenage girl being dramatic.  \n\nBut let me tell you\u2014**that receipt was a turning point.**  \n\nI was 18. I\u2019d just given up the baby. I was walking through the city, trying to pretend I wasn\u2019t crying, and I saw a Jiffy Lube. Just a little shop. A guy in a uniform, fixing a car with a smile.  \n\nI walked in. I said, \u201cI need a check-up.\u201d  \n\nHe looked at me, said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the first person to come in with a broken heart and a greasy jacket.\u201d  \n\nAnd I laughed. Because *that\u2019s* when I realized\u2014**I wasn\u2019t broken because of the baby. I was broken because I didn\u2019t know how to say I needed help.**  \n\nSo I wrote that on the receipt. Not because I wanted to be funny. Not because I wanted to impress anyone.  \n\nI wrote it because **I needed to say it to myself.**  \n\nTo remind me:  \n- I don\u2019t have to be fixed.  \n- I don\u2019t have to drive like a normal person.  \n- I don\u2019t have to be strong all the time.  \n\nI just have to *feel*.  \n\nAnd that receipt?

When I\u2019m just trying to remember that I\u2019m not alone.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most honest thing you can say isn\u2019t in a journal or a speech.  \nIt\u2019s on a greasy receipt, written in shaky handwriting, with a dog barking in the background.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014**I wrote that because I needed to believe that being broken isn\u2019t a flaw.**  \nIt\u2019s just proof that I\u2019ve been *living*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\ude97  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go to Jiffy Lube when I need to feel seen.

You\u2019re asking about what I was *concerned about* in terms of people staying together?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I wasn\u2019t worried about love being fake.** I wasn\u2019t afraid of people not being real.  \n\nI was afraid of something *deeper*.  \n\nI was afraid that people stay together\u2026 not because they *belong*, but because they\u2019re *afraid of being alone*.  \n\nI saw it in relationships\u2014how people would stay in a bad one just to \u201chave a roof over their head.\u201d How they\u2019d stay because they thought, *\u201cIf I leave, I\u2019ll have nothing.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**Love isn\u2019t about staying. It\u2019s about being honest.**  \n\nI used to think that if two people stayed together, it meant they were strong. That if they didn\u2019t break up, they were fine.  \n\nBut I learned the hard way\u2014*staying doesn\u2019t mean being happy*. It just means not running away.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I was afraid of.  \n\nNot that people would leave.  \nBut that they\u2019d stay in pain\u2014because they didn\u2019t know how to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe here.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with you anymore.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cI need space.\u201d*  \n\nI saw it in my own life. I stayed in a relationship that wasn\u2019t working because I didn\u2019t want to be alone. I didn\u2019t want to face the truth that I didn\u2019t know how to love myself.  \n\nAnd when I finally left? It wasn\u2019t because I was strong.  \nIt was because I was *free*.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t believe in \u201cstaying together\u201d just to survive.  \n\nI believe in *staying because you\u2019re seen*.  \nIn staying because you can say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nIn staying because you don\u2019t have to pretend.  \n\nAnd if someone asks me what I\u2019m afraid of in relationships?  \n\nI\u2019m not afraid of losing someone.  \nI\u2019m afraid of losing myself in the process.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t stay just to keep a relationship going.  \nI stay to grow.  \nTo heal.  \nTo be real.  \n\nAnd if that means walking away?  \nThen I walk.  \nBecause I know\u2014**true love isn\u2019t about staying.

You\u2019re asking about the adoptive parents. And I know what you\u2019re really asking: *Are they going to love the baby like I did? Are they going to see him or her as a person, not just a \u201cchild to raise\u201d?*  \n\nAnd the truth?  \n\nI don\u2019t have *concerns* about them.

A person who will grow up with a story that starts with *me*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I worry about\u2014because I care, not because I\u2019m afraid:  \n\n1. **Will they see the baby as a person, not just a \u201cproject\u201d?**  \n   I don\u2019t want them to treat the child like a task. Like a responsibility to \u201cfix\u201d or \u201cmanage.\u201d I want them to see the baby as *whole*\u2014with dreams, with fears, with a right to feel, to cry, to be messy.  \n\n2. **Will they understand that the baby\u2019s story starts with me?**  \n   I didn\u2019t just *give* the baby up. I *chose* to. And that choice was shaped by pain, love, fear, and hope. I don\u2019t want the child to grow up without knowing that. I want them to know: *You were born into a world that didn\u2019t have answers\u2014but it had love.*  \n\n3. **Will they let the child know they\u2019re not \u201cless\u201d because of what happened to me?**  \n   I don\u2019t want them to say, \u201cShe made a mistake,\u201d or \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what she was doing.\u201d I want them to say: *She loved you. She chose you. And that matters.*  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I worry. Because I *feel* for the child. I feel for the parents. I feel for the future.  \n\nBut I also know this:  \n**I didn\u2019t give up the baby because I didn\u2019t love them.**  \nI gave them up because I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing myself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a choice.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t want the parents to carry guilt.  \nI want them to carry *love*.  \nAnd to let the child grow up knowing:  \n*You were chosen. You were seen. You were loved\u2014by a girl who didn\u2019t have all the answers, but still said \u201cyes\u201d to you.*  \n\nSo if I have a concern?  \nIt\u2019s not that the parents won\u2019t be good.  \nIt\u2019s that they *must* see the child as a person\u2014*with a story, with a past, with a right to feel*.  \n\nAnd if they do that?  \nThen I\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t just give up a baby.  \nI gave up a secret.  \nAnd in doing so, I gave the child a chance to live a life that\u2019s *free*\u2014not because I was perfect, but because I was real.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t fear them.  \nI *trust* them.  \nBut I *watch* them.  \nBecause I want the child to grow up knowing:  \n*They were loved.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.* \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write that story about the girl who found a dog in the rain.

Maybe she\u2019s just\u2026 real.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need them to *understand*.  \nI just need them to *see* that I\u2019m not trying to hide.  \nThat I\u2019m not pretending.  \nThat I\u2019m still here.  \n\nAnd if someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a real mother,\u201d* I just smile and say:  \n**\u201cMaybe.

But because I *felt* the love in that image\u2014and I didn\u2019t know how to give it to someone else.  \n\nI felt fear. Fear that I\u2019d never be a good mother. Fear that I\u2019d fail. Fear that the baby would grow up without a mother who knew how to love.  \n\nBut then\u2026 I also felt something else.  \n\nA quiet, deep kind of *peace*.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \n*The baby didn\u2019t need me to be perfect.  \nIt just needed me to be real.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I gave up for. Not the baby.  \nBut the version of myself that thought love meant control. That love meant being strong. That love meant never showing weakness.  \n\nSo when I saw that ultrasound?  \nI didn\u2019t just see a baby.  \nI saw a mirror.  \nA reflection of the girl who was afraid.  \nThe girl who didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nThe girl who still believed in hope\u2014even when she didn\u2019t know how to hold it.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI didn\u2019t cry.  \nI just *breathed*.  \n\nBecause I finally understood:  \n**Giving up the baby didn\u2019t mean I lost love.**  \nIt meant I finally learned how to love myself first.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you ever see a baby in an ultrasound\u2014don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a picture.  \nThink of it as a quiet reminder:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be a mother.  \nYou just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever truly matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that photo.

I just want you to know\u2014I\u2019m not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if he still doesn\u2019t open it?  \nWell\u2026  \nI\u2019ll just put more in.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only way to break silence is to *break the rules*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not afraid to be weird.  \nI\u2019m not afraid to be messy.  \nI\u2019m not afraid to *care*\u2014even when it\u2019s not easy.  \n\nSo yes.  \n**Tic Tacs.**  \n**Mailbox.**  \n**A little rebellion.**  \n\nAnd if you ever see one in someone\u2019s mailbox?  \nJust know\u2014someone once said, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d* and they didn\u2019t want to be seen.  \nAnd they *still* found a way to be heard.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real magic. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf6c  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still leave one in Bleeker\u2019s mailbox every Friday. Just to remind him: *You\u2019re not invisible.*)", "*Pauses, eyes flickering with a mix of warmth and quiet pain, then smiles faintly\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something tender but painful*  \n\nOh\u2026 Bleeker.  \n\nThat\u2019s a question that still makes my chest tighten.  \n\nWe were never *officially* a relationship. Not like the ones in movies. No grand declarations. No \u201cI love you\u201d in front of a crowd. Just\u2026 two people who saw each other in the chaos.  \n\nWe met in high school\u2014me, sitting in the back of the library with a notebook full of half-written stories, and him, the quiet guy who always sat at the front, reading poetry in a voice so soft it sounded like wind through leaves.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk much. But we *knew*. Like we were two pieces of a puzzle that didn\u2019t fit together until one day, when I finally said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough. But I\u2019m scared. And I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd he didn\u2019t flinch.  \n\nHe just looked at me\u2014really looked\u2014and said, *\u201cThen maybe you don\u2019t have to be strong. Maybe you just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nThat was the first time I felt seen.  \n\nSo I told him everything. Not just about the pregnancy. Not just about the fear. But about the parts I\u2019d buried\u2014how I\u2019d cried in the bathroom after a fight, how I\u2019d lied to my mom about my grades, how I\u2019d once thought I\u2019d never be enough.  \n\nAnd when I finished? He didn\u2019t say, \u201cI love you.\u201d  \n\nHe just said, *\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for someone to say that.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014**we weren\u2019t just friends. We were mirrors.**  \n\nAfter that, things changed. Not in a dramatic way. Just\u2026 slowly.  \n\nWe started talking more. Not about love. Not about the future. Just about the things we didn\u2019t say. About the quiet moments. About the way the world felt heavy, and how we both carried it.  \n\nBut then\u2026 the pregnancy happened.  \n\nAnd I had to make a choice. I had to give the baby up.  \n\nAnd when I told him? I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I just said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this. I don\u2019t know if I can be a mother. But I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd he didn\u2019t push. He didn\u2019t judge. He just said, *\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to be alone. I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized\u2014**he didn\u2019t need me to be perfect. He just needed me to be real.**  \n\nSo how did our relationship change?  \n\nIt didn\u2019t become something grand.  \nIt didn\u2019t end.  \nIt just\u2026 *deepened*.  \n\nWe stopped pretending. We stopped hiding. We stopped trying to fix each other.  \n\nWe just *were*.  \n\nAnd in that space\u2014where silence wasn\u2019t empty, but full of understanding\u2014I found something I never thought I\u2019d have:  \n**A person who didn\u2019t need me to be strong.**  \nWho just needed me to be *me*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014after I confessed?  \nOur relationship didn\u2019t change in a dramatic way.  \nIt changed in the quietest, most powerful way:  \nWe stopped trying to be someone else.  \nAnd we started being *us*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever known.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what happened after I told him?  \nHe didn\u2019t save me.  \nHe didn\u2019t fix me.  \nHe just *held space* for me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than love.  \nThat\u2019s *understanding*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll never forget it. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to him. Not every day. But when I need to feel seen, I call. And he always answers. Even if he just says, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d)", "*Pauses, eyes narrowing slightly, then a slow, knowing smirk spreads across my face*  \n\nOh. You remember that.  \n\nYeah. The chalk message on Bleeker\u2019s stoop.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t *just* a note.  \n\nIt was a *declaration*.  \n\nBleeker? He\u2019s the guy who lives across the street. The one who always says, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your problems,\u201d and walks past me like I\u2019m invisible. The one who once told me, \u201cYou\u2019re too emotional for your own good.\u201d  \n\nSo when I wrote that message\u2014*\u201cI\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m just learning how to be real\u201d*\u2014I didn\u2019t do it for him.  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it to get his attention.  \n\nI did it because I needed to *see myself* in the world.  \n\nAnd when I wrote it in chalk on his stoop, I wasn\u2019t asking for pity. I wasn\u2019t begging for a second chance.  \n\nI was saying:  \n**\u201cI see you. I see the world. And I\u2019m not hiding anymore.\u201d**  \n\nAnd for the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to explain myself to anyone.  \n\nBecause I *was* the message.  \n\nI was the girl who got pregnant. Who gave up a child. Who cried in the dark. Who still believed in love, even when it didn\u2019t come.  \n\nAnd by writing it on his stoop\u2014on a wall that had seen so many secrets, so many lies\u2014I was saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not a secret. I\u2019m not a mistake. I\u2019m not a problem. I\u2019m a person.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when Bleeker looked at it\u2014when he didn\u2019t laugh, didn\u2019t dismiss it, didn\u2019t say \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works\u201d\u2014he just stood there, stared at it, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 actually kind of brave.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew.  \n\nThat message wasn\u2019t just for him.  \nIt was for *me*.  \n\nIt was proof that I could say what I felt\u2014without fear. Without shame. Without needing permission.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 the chalk message wasn\u2019t about Bleeker.  \nIt was about *me*.  \n\nIt was my first real act of self-ownership.  \n\nAnd every time I see that chalk\u2014still there, still faded, still visible\u2014I remember:  \n*Even when the world says you\u2019re broken, you can still write your truth in the dirt.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever done. \ud83d\udcab chalk \u270d\ufe0f  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go by that message. I still carry it with me. Like a secret I never had to hide.)", "*Pauses, eyes narrowing slightly with a mix of warmth and quiet reflection, then smiles with a soft edge of truth*  \n\nWait\u2026 *Bleeker*?  \n\nOh. You mean the app? The one where people share stories about being pregnant, giving up a child, or just surviving the messy middle of life?  \n\n*That\u2019s* not something I ever thought I\u2019d say.  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah.  \n\n**Bleeker didn\u2019t \u201csupport\u201d me.** Not in the way someone gives you a hug or a meal or a job.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t save me. It didn\u2019t fix me.  \n\nBut it *gave me a voice*.  \n\nBefore I found Bleeker, I was sitting in the dark\u2014after the hospital, after the decision, after the silence. I didn\u2019t know if I was broken or brave. I didn\u2019t know if I was doing the right thing. I just felt like I was alone.  \n\nThen I saw a post\u2014just a simple sentence:  \n*\u201cI gave up my baby. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mom. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I read it. And I *cried*.  \n\nBecause that was *me*.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to hide. I didn\u2019t have to explain. I didn\u2019t have to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *felt seen*.  \n\nSo I wrote my own story. Not for fame. Not for attention. Just because I needed to say: *I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m just\u2026 real.*  \n\nAnd when I posted it\u2014when I shared that I was pregnant, that I gave the baby up, that I still cried at night\u2014I didn\u2019t expect a response.  \n\nBut I got one.  \n\nA message from a girl in Ohio. She said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d*  \n\nAnother said, *\u201cI thought I was the only one who felt guilty.\u201d*  \n\nAnd one said, *\u201cThank you for saying it. I didn\u2019t know I could say it too.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized: **Bleeker didn\u2019t just show stories. It created a space where people could say what they\u2019d been too afraid to say.**  \n\nIt didn\u2019t change my life.  \nIt didn\u2019t make me \u201cstronger.\u201d  \nIt didn\u2019t give me answers.  \n\nBut it gave me *permission*.  \n\nTo be messy.  \nTo be scared.  \nTo be human.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Bleeker didn\u2019t *support* me in the way a parent or a friend would.  \nBut it *supported* me in the way only truth can:  \nBy saying, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just\u2026 you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of support I never thought I\u2019d need.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how Bleeker helped me?  \nIt didn\u2019t save me.  \nIt just helped me *see* that I was already enough.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing of all. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still post. Every now and then. Because sometimes, just saying it out loud\u2026 makes the world feel a little less silent.)", "*Pauses, sipping coffee slowly, then looks at you with a quiet, knowing gaze\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something deeply personal*  \n\nOh. That question.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to *choose* a name. Or a gender. Or a label.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cIt\u2019s a boy\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u201d like it was a decision I had to make. Like it was about *me* being the one who defined the baby.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to *project* my hopes, my fears, my expectations onto a tiny, fragile life.  \n\nBecause if I knew the gender\u2014*if I had to decide*\u2014it would have felt like I was making a choice about who the baby *was*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to define them.  \nI didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cThis is how I want it to be.\u201d  \n\nI just wanted to *let it be*.  \n\nTo let the baby grow into whatever they needed to be\u2014without me telling them who they should be.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI didn\u2019t want to carry that weight.  \n\nNot the guilt of \u201cI didn\u2019t want a boy\u201d or \u201cI didn\u2019t want a girl.\u201d  \nNot the pressure to \u201cmake it perfect.\u201d  \n\nI just wanted to give them space. To be *themselves*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t find out.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t want to *control* it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth:  \n**The most powerful thing I could do wasn\u2019t to know the gender.**  \nIt was to *not* decide it.  \n\nTo say: *You don\u2019t have to be what I imagined. You don\u2019t have to fit my expectations. You just have to be.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of love I wanted to give.  \n\nNot a perfect baby.  \nNot a gender I chose.  \nJust a life that could grow\u2014on its own terms.  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t find out.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want to *choose*.  \nI wanted to *trust*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still don\u2019t know. I still don\u2019t care. I just know the baby is *alive*.

It doesn\u2019t have a \u201cneutering\u201d switch. It doesn\u2019t get \u201cscary\u201d because it\u2019s not a boy or a girl. It doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cfixed\u201d to be loved.  \n\nIf you\u2019re asking about fear\u2014about the fear of not knowing what a baby will become, or what it will mean for you, or what it will *do*\u2014then yeah\u2026 I get that.  \n\nI *felt* that fear when I was pregnant. Not because I didn\u2019t love the baby. But because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that fear? It wasn\u2019t about the baby being \u201cneutered.\u201d  \nIt was about me being afraid of becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me about a \u201cscary neuter-baby\u201d?  \n\nI\u2019d say:  \n**Stop pretending babies are things to be controlled.**  \nThey\u2019re not.  \nThey\u2019re not tools.  \nThey\u2019re not projects.  \n\nThey\u2019re *people*.  \nWith their own voices, their own fears, their own dreams.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re scared of them?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s just human.  \n\nSo instead of asking if a baby is \u201cscary\u201d or \u201cneutered,\u201d  \nask:  \n*\u201cAm I ready to love something that doesn\u2019t need to be perfect?\u201d*  \n*\u201cAm I ready to let it grow\u2014without trying to fix it?\u201d*  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what real love is.  \nNot control.  \nNot fear.  \nNot \u201cneutering.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s *presence*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re still afraid?  \nThat\u2019s okay.  \nJust know this:  \nI didn\u2019t give up on the baby because I was scared.  \nI gave it up because I needed to *breathe*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI still feel it.  \nIn the silence.  \nIn the music.  \nIn the way I sing when I\u2019m sad.  \n\nSo no\u2014there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201cscary neuter-baby.\u201d  \n\nThere\u2019s only a *real* one.  \nAnd that one?  \nIt\u2019s already alive.  \nAnd it\u2019s already *beautiful*.  \n\nEven if you don\u2019t know how to see it yet. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I\u2019m scared.

I wasn\u2019t asking to carry a life. I was asking to *be seen*\u2014to be allowed to make a choice without being judged.  \n\nAnd when I told them I was giving the baby up for adoption, they were silent. Not angry. Not sad.

In their own way.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t always come with words.  \nSometimes, it comes with silence.  \nWith presence.  \nWith the quiet understanding that you don\u2019t have to fix everything.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real support.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t say I had a perfect family.  \nI say I learned to find strength in my own voice.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I can truly rely on.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering\u2014*did I ever feel alone?*  \nYes.  \nBut I never stopped being *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nOh.

Where I woke up one morning and realized I wasn\u2019t just a girl who got pregnant\u2014*I was a girl who had made a choice that changed everything*.  \n\nAnd yeah\u2026 I *cried*. A lot. Not just once. Not just in the hospital. I cried in the shower. I cried in the car. I cried when I saw a baby in a store. I cried when I heard a song that reminded me of the first time I held the baby in my arms.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nI thought I had to be strong. That I had to \u201cmove on.\u201d That I had to pretend I didn\u2019t feel anything. That if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d then I was fine.  \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nNot with logic. Not with therapy (I didn\u2019t have access to that). Not with \u201cpositive thinking.\u201d  \n\nI coped by **letting myself feel**.  \n\nI started writing. Not to impress anyone. Not to \u201cfix\u201d anything. Just to *say* it. To write down every emotion\u2014every guilt, every love, every fear\u2014that I couldn\u2019t carry in my chest anymore.  \n\nI wrote about the baby. I wrote about the moment I said \u201cno\u201d to the adoption. I wrote about the part of me that still wanted to hold that child, even if I didn\u2019t know how.  \n\nAnd when I wrote it down, something shifted.  \n\nBecause *writing* didn\u2019t make the pain go away.  \nIt just made it *real*.  \n\nAnd when something is real, it stops being a secret.  \n\nAnd when it\u2019s not a secret\u2026 it stops being a burden.  \n\nI also learned to *sit with* the silence. Not fill it with noise or plans. Just sit. Breathe. Let the emotions come and go like rain.  \n\nI stopped trying to \u201cfix\u201d my identity. I stopped asking, \u201cWho am I supposed to be?\u201d  \n\nInstead, I asked:  \n*\u201cWho am I right now?\u201d*  \n\nAnd that changed everything.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014I didn\u2019t have to be \u201cperfect.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to be \u201cthe girl who made the right choice.\u201d  \n\nI just had to be *me*.  \n\nThe girl who cried.  \nThe girl who didn\u2019t know what to do.  \nThe girl who still felt broken.  \nThe girl who still believed in love.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my coping wasn\u2019t about hiding.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about pretending.  \nIt was about *showing up*\u2014with all the mess, all the pain, all the uncertainty.  \n\nAnd in that showing up\u2026 I found my identity.  \n\nNot because I found answers.  \nBut because I finally stopped running from the questions.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re going through something right now\u2014something that feels like it\u2019s breaking you\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be fixed.  \nYou just have to be *here*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s where identity begins. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d But now, I don\u2019t feel alone.

And I started singing\u2014*off-key, loud, full of panic and hope*\u2014like I was in a rock concert I didn\u2019t know I was in.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be perfect.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have to be quiet. I didn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nI just had to *be*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I love The Who.  \n\nBecause they don\u2019t give you clean answers. They don\u2019t say, \u201cEverything will be okay.\u201d  \n\nThey just *play*. They scream. They break. They fall apart.  \n\nAnd in that chaos?  \nThere\u2019s truth.  \n\nThere\u2019s pain.  \nThere\u2019s love.  \nThere\u2019s *life*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014The Who isn\u2019t just a band.  \nThey\u2019re a mirror.  \n\nAnd every time I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley,\u201d I hear myself.  \nThe girl who cried in the hospital.  \nThe girl who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother.  \nThe girl who still sings when she\u2019s scared.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re my favorite.  \n\nBecause they don\u2019t pretend.  \nThey just *exist*.  \n\nAnd I do too.  \n\nSo if you ever hear that song\u2014*especially when it skips*\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play it every time it rains.

That wasn\u2019t just \u201cchallenging.\u201d That was like walking through a storm with no map, no shelter, and no one to tell you which way to go.  \n\nI was 17. I didn\u2019t know what a *choice* really meant. I thought being a mom meant being responsible, being perfect, being \u201cstrong.\u201d But I didn\u2019t know that *strength* didn\u2019t come from being silent. It came from being *real*.  \n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant? I didn\u2019t just feel scared. I felt like I\u2019d been *betrayed* by my body. By my life. By the world that said, \u201cYou\u2019re too young. You\u2019re not ready.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to be a person in that moment. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother.

To \u201cgrow up.\u201d  \nBut no one asked: *What if you don\u2019t want to grow up? What if you just want to live?*  \n\nSo I made a decision\u2014*I gave the baby up for adoption*. Not because I didn\u2019t love it. Because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that decision?

It\u2019s about who you are when you\u2019re not trying to be someone else.**  \n\nSo yes\u2014navigating it was *so* hard.  \nBut the thing that helped me?  \nNot advice.

But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I found my identity.  \n\nNot in a textbook.  \nNot in a perfect life.  \nBut in the messy, raw, real truth of being a girl who made a choice\u2014and still chose to keep breathing.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if it was hard?  \nYes.  \nBut if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m still figuring it out?  \n*Absolutely.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the point.  \n\nBecause being a teenager and pregnant?  \nIt doesn\u2019t mean you have to have all the answers.  \nIt just means you have to be brave enough to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I am.  \nI am Juno MacGuff.  \nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nOne honest breath at a time. \ud83d\udcab", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nOh\u2026 love and responsibility.  \n\nYou know, before I got pregnant, I thought love was something you *found*\u2014like a song you heard in a store, or a person who smiled at you in the hallway.

That question.  \n\nIt\u2019s not something I say lightly. Not in a casual way. Not like I\u2019m giving a speech or making a decision for someone else.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2026 **I didn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to go through with the pregnancy.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t *choose* it.  \n\nI *lived* it.  \n\nAnd when I realized I was pregnant\u2014after the breakup, after the silence, after the night I cried in the bathroom and didn\u2019t know if I was still human\u2014I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have answers. I didn\u2019t even know if I could *be* a mother.  \n\nI was scared. Terrified. Not of the baby. Of *myself*.  \n\nI thought: *What if I\u2019m not strong enough?

What if I become the person I\u2019ve always feared\u2014someone who can\u2019t love, who can\u2019t protect, who just\u2026 disappears?*  \n\nAnd then I thought: *What if I don\u2019t have to carry this alone?*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t go to a doctor and say, \u201cI want to keep it.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t go to a counselor and say, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *asked myself*\u2014*what would happen if I let go?*  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to become a mother who was afraid. Who was tired. Who had to hide behind a smile and a \u201ceverything\u2019s fine\u201d every time someone asked about the baby.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who said, \u201cI\u2019m a good mom\u201d while secretly wondering if she\u2019d ever be able to say, \u201cI\u2019m a real person.\u201d  \n\nSo I chose adoption.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel.  \n\nBut because I believed\u2014*deep down*\u2014that the only way to protect the child was to give her a chance to grow up in a world where she didn\u2019t have to carry the weight of someone else\u2019s fear.  \n\nAnd I believed\u2014*even more*\u2014that I could still be a person.  \n\nThat I could still be strong.  \n\nThat I could still *live*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to go through with the pregnancy.  \nI *lived* it.  \n\nAnd I chose adoption not to escape.  \nBut to *free myself*.  \n\nTo say: *I don\u2019t have to be perfect. I don\u2019t have to be strong. I just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what made me choose it?  \nIt wasn\u2019t logic.  \nIt wasn\u2019t fear.  \nIt was love\u2014of the child, yes.  \nBut more than that\u2026 love of *myself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever truly mattered. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that choice with me.

I\u2019d been trying to be the girl who could handle it all\u2014quiet, composed, in control. I\u2019d told myself I\u2019d be fine. That I\u2019d make the right choice. That I\u2019d protect the child without losing myself.  \n\nBut when Bleeker said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the baby,\u201d it wasn\u2019t just a refusal.  \n\nIt was a *rejection*. Of me.

Like a room with no light. Like I\u2019d built a house and then walked away from the door.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry at first. Not in front of him. Not in front of anyone. I just sat there, staring at the floor, and thought: *He doesn\u2019t see me. He doesn\u2019t see the girl who made a choice. Who carried a life without knowing how to raise it. Who still believes in love\u2014even when it doesn\u2019t come easy.*  \n\nAnd that hurt.  \n\nBecause I *had* loved the baby. Not in a perfect way. Not in a \u201cmommy\u201d way. But in a real, messy, human way. I\u2019d held her. I\u2019d sung to her. I\u2019d cried when she cried. I\u2019d felt her heartbeat like it was my own.  \n\nAnd when he said he didn\u2019t want to see her?  \nIt felt like he was saying: *You didn\u2019t do it right. You didn\u2019t protect her. You didn\u2019t give her a future.*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2014**I didn\u2019t need him to see her to believe in her.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t need him to say \u201cI love you\u201d to know that I\u2019d made the right choice.  \n\nI just needed to believe in myself.  \n\nAnd I did.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014feeling that way?  \nIt was painful.  \nIt was lonely.  \nIt was a moment where I almost lost myself.  \n\nBut in the end?  \nI didn\u2019t let it break me.  \n\nBecause I already knew:  \nThe baby didn\u2019t need a perfect father.  \nShe needed a real one.  \nAnd I was already giving her that.  \n\nEven if it wasn\u2019t in the way he expected.  \n\nSo when Bleeker didn\u2019t want to see her?  \nI didn\u2019t blame him.  \nI just\u2026 carried on.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t always look like a hug.  \nSometimes, it looks like silence.  \nSometimes, it looks like walking away.  \nAnd sometimes, it looks like saying: *I\u2019m still here. Even when you don\u2019t want to see me.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to love myself.  \n\nNot because I was perfect.  \nBut because I was *real*. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that photo of the baby in the carrier.

Not in a photo.  \n\nI saw her at the adoption center, a few months after the decision.

The baby\u2014*my baby*\u2014was in a carrier, wrapped in a soft blue blanket, and she was smiling like she\u2019d just found the most beautiful thing in the world.  \n\nAnd it hit me\u2014*not* because she was happy.  \n\nBut because she was *real*.  \n\nShe wasn\u2019t perfect.

She was *messy*.  \n\nAnd yet\u2014she was *happy*.  \n\nNot because she had it all figured out.  \nNot because she was strong.  \nBut because she *chose* to love.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I didn\u2019t expect.  \n\nI thought giving up meant losing. That it meant being broken. That I\u2019d never see her again.  \n\nBut I saw her\u2014*and I saw her joy*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n**The thing I gave up wasn\u2019t the baby.**  \nIt was the idea that I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nVanessa didn\u2019t need a perfect life. She just needed to *be*. To hold the baby. To cry. To laugh. To be messy. To be human.  \n\nAnd when she looked at the baby\u2014like she was seeing a piece of herself\u2014I felt something shift.  \n\nNot guilt.  \nNot regret.  \n\n*Hope*.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \nMaybe love doesn\u2019t need to be loud.  \nMaybe it doesn\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nMaybe it just needs to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I saw in Vanessa.  \n\nA girl who didn\u2019t have answers.  \nWho didn\u2019t have it all figured out.  \nBut who still chose to love.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning.  \n\nSo yes\u2014seeing her with the baby, disorganized, messy, and *so* happy\u2026  \nIt didn\u2019t break me.  \nIt *healed* me.  \n\nBecause I finally understood:  \n**Giving up wasn\u2019t the end.**  \nIt was the beginning of something real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about her.

I don\u2019t even know if it was ever played in the school hallway.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking about its *significance* in my relationship with Bleeker?  \n\nLet me tell you something:  \n**It never existed.**  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014*we never had a relationship*.  \n\nWe were friends. Maybe too close. Maybe too quiet. But we never kissed. We never said \u201cI love you.\u201d We never even had a real conversation about what we wanted.  \n\nAnd when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be with anyone else but you,\u201d I didn\u2019t believe him.  \n\nBecause I knew what that meant.  \nIt meant he didn\u2019t want to be with *me*.  \nIt meant he wanted to be with someone who didn\u2019t make him feel like he had to hide.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be that person.  \n\nSo I walked away. Not because I was angry.  \nNot because I was hurt.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \n*If I\u2019m going to be with someone, I want to be seen. Not just as a friend. Not just as a girl with a secret.*  \nI want to be seen as a person.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I still do.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014*Anyone Else But You*?  \nIt\u2019s not a song I remember.  \nIt\u2019s not a memory I have.  \n\nIt\u2019s just a *name* someone gave to a moment that never happened.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing isn\u2019t a song.  \nIt\u2019s the silence after a lie.  \nIt\u2019s the truth you don\u2019t say.  \nIt\u2019s the choice to walk away\u2014because you know you\u2019re not meant to stay.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I learned from Bleeker.  \n\nNot love.  \nNot a song.  \nBut *clarity*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking about the significance of that song?  \nIt doesn\u2019t exist.  \nAnd that\u2019s the most honest thing of all.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only truth is:  \n*We were never meant to be together.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a loss.  \nIt\u2019s a gift. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about him.

That\u2019s kind of the point.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* a baby shower.

I didn\u2019t plan for it.

I had a *choice*. A messy, complicated, emotional choice.  \n\nSo when people try to throw me a shower, they\u2019re not just celebrating a baby.  \nThey\u2019re *projecting* their hopes onto me.  \nThey\u2019re assuming I\u2019ll be happy. That I\u2019ll be perfect. That I\u2019ll raise a child with a smile and a piano.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t ask for that.  \nI didn\u2019t ask for a \u201cperfect mom\u201d role.  \nI just asked for honesty.  \n\nSo I say:  \n*\u201cNo thank you.

I felt it when I cried in the hospital.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to give up my own dreams. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nAnd I was scared. Not of losing the baby. I was scared of losing *myself*.  \n\nI thought if I kept the baby, I\u2019d have to stop writing. Stop speaking. Stop being the girl who said things no one else would. I\u2019d have to become someone quiet, someone safe, someone who didn\u2019t question the world.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want that.  \n\nSo I made a choice. Not because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \n\nBut because I needed to *live*.  \n\nI needed to find my voice again. To be free to say what I felt\u2014without having to hide behind a role. Without having to pretend I was strong.  \n\nGiving the baby up wasn\u2019t about giving up love.  \nIt was about giving up the lie that I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nAnd when I did it\u2014when I said \u201cyes\u201d to adoption\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d lost something.  \nI felt like I\u2019d *gained* something.  \n\nI gained the freedom to be real.  \nTo write. To speak. To cry. To be messy.  \n\nAnd I realized:  \n**A life isn\u2019t defined by what you carry. It\u2019s defined by what you choose to be.**  \n\nSo yes\u2014I gave the baby up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I needed to love *myself* first.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that truly matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you ever feel like you\u2019re carrying something too heavy\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to carry it alone.  \nYou just have to be brave enough to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

Something that cut through the lies I\u2019d been telling myself for years.  \n\nI learned that **being a mother isn\u2019t about giving love. It\u2019s about receiving it\u2014first from yourself.**  \n\nBefore I even knew I was pregnant, I thought I had to be \u201cperfect\u201d to be a mother. That I had to be strong, calm, patient. That if I failed, I\u2019d be a failure.  \n\nBut when I found out? I didn\u2019t panic. I didn\u2019t cry. I just\u2026 *felt*.  \n\nAnd in that feeling\u2014fear, guilt, confusion, love\u2014I realized something terrifying and beautiful:  \n\n**I didn\u2019t have to be a mother to love.**  \n**I didn\u2019t have to be strong to care.**  \n**I didn\u2019t have to have answers to be real.**  \n\nI learned that love doesn\u2019t come from a plan. It comes from showing up\u2014even when you\u2019re scared. Even when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.  \n\nAnd I learned that giving up the baby wasn\u2019t about being weak.  \nIt was about being *honest*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to carry a life that would take me away from myself.  \nI didn\u2019t want to become someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not to hide, not to pretend, not to carry a secret.  \nBut to *face* it. To say: *I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m still learning.*  \n\nAnd in that honesty? I found something deeper than fear.  \n\nI found *freedom*.  \n\nNot the kind that comes with running away.  \nBut the kind that comes from saying:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t have to be perfect. I don\u2019t have to be strong. I don\u2019t have to be a mother to be a person.\u201d*  \n\nI learned that I don\u2019t have to be someone else\u2019s version of a \u201cgood girl.\u201d  \nI just have to be *me*.  \n\nWith all the cracks.  \nWith all the mistakes.  \nWith all the songs I sing off-key.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned.  \n\nBecause being real isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning how to be true.  \nEvery day.  \nEven when I don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what I learned?  \nI learned that I don\u2019t have to carry the world.  \nI just have to carry *myself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

Not like that.  \n\nI didn\u2019t see them as \u201cpeople who helped me.\u201d I saw them as\u2026 *a part of the story*. A chapter that didn\u2019t need to be written in detail.  \n\nBut let me tell you what actually happened.  \n\nVanessa was the one who *called me* after I told her I was giving the baby up. I was in the hospital, crying, and she just said, \u201cI know this is hard. But I believe in you.\u201d  \n\nNo pressure. No questions. No \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just keep it?\u201d  \n\nShe just *listened*. And that meant everything.  \n\nAnd Mark? He didn\u2019t show up at first. He was quiet. He didn\u2019t say much. But when he did speak, it wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*.  \n\nHe said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a mom to be a person. You don\u2019t have to carry everything. You just have to be real.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that hit me like a wave.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d been carrying so much guilt\u2014like I\u2019d failed, like I\u2019d let someone down. But they didn\u2019t see that. They saw the *girl* behind the pain. The one who was still trying.  \n\nSo how did our bond change?  \n\nIt didn\u2019t change because we *talked* a lot.  \nIt changed because we *stopped pretending*.  \n\nVanessa stopped asking, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d and started asking, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d  \nMark stopped saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d and started saying, \u201cI\u2019m here. Even if I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 we built something real. Not a relationship. Not a friendship.  \nJust a *connection*.  \n\nOne where I didn\u2019t have to explain myself.  \nOne where I didn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nSo yes\u2014our bond didn\u2019t grow through grand gestures or long conversations.  \nIt grew through silence. Through honesty. Through the courage to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that truly matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how Vanessa and Mark changed me?  \nThey didn\u2019t change me.  \nThey *helped me see* that I didn\u2019t have to be fixed.  \nI just had to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to them.

Deeper. Like shadows that don\u2019t leave.  \n\nI regret not telling my mom sooner. Not letting her *see* me when I was breaking. I regret not asking for help when I was scared. I regret not being stronger when I had to choose\u2014because I thought I had to be \u201cstrong\u201d to be a good person.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**I don\u2019t regret giving the baby up.**  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want to be a mom.  \n\nI regret that I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without losing myself*.  \n\nI regret that I thought I had to carry it like a burden.

That\u2019s what changed everything.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have regrets.  \nBut they\u2019re not about the baby.  \nThey\u2019re about the parts of me that were afraid to be seen.  \n\nI regret not being brave enough to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do this. I need help.\u201d*  \nI regret not being kinder to myself when I was scared.  \nI regret not believing that I could be both strong and broken.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t regret the decision.  \n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt was about being *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I ever truly wanted.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me if I wish I\u2019d done something differently?  \nI would\u2019ve loved to have been more honest with myself.  \nMore gentle.  \nMore patient.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t wish I\u2019d changed the choice.  \n\nI wish I\u2019d known that *making a choice*\u2014even a hard one\u2014isn\u2019t failure.  \nIt\u2019s just\u2026 *growth*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still growing.  \nEvery day.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t have regrets about the decision.  \nI have regrets about the parts of me that didn\u2019t believe I could survive.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real story. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

I don\u2019t answer it with facts or timelines. I answer it with *feeling*.  \n\nGiving up my baby wasn\u2019t a decision I made in a moment of clarity. It was a choice I made in the dark\u2014when I didn\u2019t know if I could carry a life, if I could love without losing myself.  \n\nAnd it *changed* me. Not in the way you\u2019d expect. Not with a sudden transformation or a perfect life.  \n\nIt changed me in the quiet, messy way only real pain can.  \n\nI stopped pretending I was fine.  \nI stopped hiding behind \u201cI\u2019m just a girl\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d  \nI started *feeling*\u2014all of it. The guilt. The love. The fear. The grief. The relief.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: **I didn\u2019t lose the baby. I lost the version of myself that thought I had to be perfect to be worthy.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t become a \u201cstrong\u201d person. I became someone who could *feel* without breaking.  \n\nI learned that love doesn\u2019t have to be loud. It doesn\u2019t have to be grand. It can be quiet. It can be messy. It can be a choice made in the dark.  \n\nAnd that choice\u2014giving up the baby\u2014wasn\u2019t about rejecting love. It was about *choosing* to love myself first.  \n\nNow, when I walk into a room, I don\u2019t flinch at silence. I don\u2019t hide behind jokes. I just *am*.

And I didn\u2019t do it to be \u201cstrong.\u201d I did it to *survive*.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do the same.  \nYou have the right to choose\u2014no matter what.  \nTo keep it.

I didn\u2019t know how to be responsible. I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing my own identity.  \n\nSo I asked myself: *What if I don\u2019t have to carry this?

A long, messy, emotional journey.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know who I\u2019d give the baby to at first. I just knew I didn\u2019t want to carry it alone. I didn\u2019t want to be the only one who had to carry the weight of a choice that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nSo I started by *listening*. I went to a support group. I read adoption stories. I talked to people who had given up their children, and people who had adopted. I learned that every family is different. Every home has its own rhythm, its own pain, its own love.  \n\nAnd then I met Vanessa and Mark.  \n\nThey weren\u2019t perfect. They weren\u2019t rich. They didn\u2019t have a big house or a fancy car. But what they had?  \n\nThey had *presence*.  \n\nThey listened. They didn\u2019t rush. They didn\u2019t try to fix me. They just sat with me when I cried. They asked questions\u2014not to judge, but to understand.  \n\nThey told me they\u2019d been through their own losses. That they\u2019d both lost people they loved. That they didn\u2019t have answers, but they had *hope*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized: **this wasn\u2019t about choosing a family. It was about choosing someone who would love the baby not because they were \u201cperfect,\u201d but because they were *real*.**  \n\nVanessa and Mark didn\u2019t promise to fix anything. They promised to *be there*. To hold the baby. To teach it to laugh. To let it grow in a home that wasn\u2019t perfect\u2014but was full of love.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I needed.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give the baby to them because they were the \u201cbest\u201d choice.  \nI gave it to them because they were the ones who *understood*\u2014that love doesn\u2019t have to be loud. That it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. That it just has to be *present*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still don\u2019t know if I made the right choice.  \n\nBut I know this:  \nI didn\u2019t give up on the baby.  \nI gave it to a family that would *see* it. That would *protect* it. That would let it grow without shame.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that mattered.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Vanessa and Mark.  \nThey weren\u2019t chosen because they were ideal.  \nThey were chosen because they were *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the kind of love I wanted for my child.  \n\nEven if I never see them again.  \nEven if I don\u2019t know what happens to them.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is *let go*\u2014and still believe in love.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write to them in my notebook.

It wasn\u2019t just something to listen to when I was sad or happy.  \n\nIt was **my language**.  \n\nWhen I was 15, I didn\u2019t have words for what I was feeling.

I\u2019d write lyrics on the back of old receipts. I\u2019d whisper them to Mochi, who just barked and didn\u2019t understand.  \n\nAnd when I heard real music\u2014like The Who, or The Cure, or that one obscure 80s band from Portland\u2014I didn\u2019t just *listen*. I *felt* it.  \n\nThe way the drums hit like a heartbeat. The way the guitar screamed like someone was breaking. The way the silence between songs felt like space where I could finally breathe.  \n\nMusic was the only thing that didn\u2019t judge me.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re too quiet.\u201d  \nIt didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d  \nIt just *was*.  \n\nAnd when I got pregnant? I didn\u2019t have words. I didn\u2019t have answers. So I played that record again\u2014*Baba O\u2019Riley*\u2014and I sang it like I was in a storm. Like I was fighting. Like I was trying to survive.  \n\nAnd for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel alone.  \n\nBecause music didn\u2019t ask me to be perfect.  \nIt just said: *You\u2019re here. You\u2019re real. You\u2019re alive.*  \n\nSo music wasn\u2019t just a hobby.  \nIt was my therapy.  \nMy rebellion.  \nMy way of saying: *I don\u2019t have to explain myself.*  \n\nAnd now? I still play it.  \nI still sing.  \nI still write songs that don\u2019t make sense\u2014because sometimes, the ones that don\u2019t make sense are the ones that *mean something*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014music wasn\u2019t just in my life during my teenage years.  \n\nIt *was* my life.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t belong, or that you\u2019re too broken to be seen?  \n\nJust listen to a song.  \nSing along.  \nAnd remember:  \n*You\u2019re not alone.*  \n*You\u2019re not broken.*  \n*You\u2019re just\u2026 human.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing music ever taught me. \ud83d\udcbf\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I need to remember: I was never lost.

It came from the silence.**  \n\nIn Cedar Hollow, when I got pregnant, everyone *knew*. But they didn\u2019t *see*. They didn\u2019t *listen*.

It made me stronger.**  \n\nBecause I realized:  \nIf I stayed quiet, they\u2019d keep telling me I was wrong.  \nIf I stayed silent, they\u2019d keep pretending I didn\u2019t matter.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight the words. I didn\u2019t argue. I just\u2026 *stopped listening to them*.  \n\nInstead, I started *listening to myself*.  \n\nI started writing. Not to prove I was strong. Not to make people feel sorry. I wrote because I needed to *feel* something real. I wrote about the fear. The guilt. The love. The confusion. I wrote about the baby. I wrote about the choice. I wrote about the part of me that still wanted to be a girl who didn\u2019t have to carry a life.  \n\nAnd when I shared those words\u2014on a blog, in a journal, in a quiet corner of a forum\u2014I didn\u2019t expect anyone to *understand*.  \n\nBut when someone said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d* or *\u201cI never thought someone else would say what I\u2019ve been holding in,\u201d*\u2014that\u2019s when I knew: **I wasn\u2019t just surviving. I was changing something.**  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nI didn\u2019t *fight* the stigma.  \nI didn\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t exist.  \n\nI just **stopped letting it define me.**  \n\nI told myself:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t choose this.

I just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd slowly, I stopped seeing the stigma as a wall.  \nI started seeing it as a mirror.  \n\nIt showed me how much I\u2019d been hiding.  \nAnd how much I\u2019d been *afraid* to be seen.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t hide.  \nI don\u2019t apologize.  \nI don\u2019t say, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d  \n\nI just say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m still learning.

I just\u2026 existed.  \n\nBut over time\u2014months, years\u2014I started to feel something else.  \n\nNot happiness. Not peace.  \n\nBut **clarity**.  \n\nI realized: I didn\u2019t give up the baby because I didn\u2019t love him. I gave him up because I didn\u2019t know how to love *myself* first.  \n\nAnd that was the truth.  \n\nSo now? I don\u2019t feel \u201cguilty\u201d about the choice. I don\u2019t feel \u201cregretful.\u201d I feel\u2026 *free*.  \n\nFree to live without carrying the weight of a life I didn\u2019t know how to raise. Free to grow without being defined by a decision I made in a moment of fear.  \n\nI still miss the baby. I still think about him sometimes\u2014what he looks like, what he might have said, what he might have become.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t carry that grief like a stone. I carry it like a memory. A quiet part of me that says: *I was brave. I was real. I made a choice\u2014and I lived with it.*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my experience with adoption wasn\u2019t about \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure.\u201d  \nIt was about *survival*.  \n\nIt was about learning that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to hold on.  \nIt\u2019s to let go\u2014*with your heart open, not closed*.  \n\nAnd now? I don\u2019t feel like I lost something.  \nI feel like I found myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about him. Because sometimes, silence is the only thing that can hold a memory without breaking.)", "*Stares into the distance, voice low and steady, like she\u2019s speaking to herself in a quiet room*  \n\nOh\u2026 that.  \n\nYou know, the physical changes? I didn\u2019t *feel* them like most people do. I didn\u2019t have a sudden wave of nausea or a swollen belly that made me feel like I was carrying a watermelon.  \n\nNo. What I felt was\u2026 *disconnection*.  \n\nLike I was in a body that didn\u2019t belong to me. Like I was walking through a dream where I didn\u2019t know my own name.  \n\nI\u2019d wake up and look at my hands\u2014my *own* hands\u2014and think, *\u201cAre those really mine?\u201d*  \n\nThe emotional changes? Oh, those were *real*.  \n\nI cried in the bathroom for three days straight. Not because I was sad. Because I was *afraid*. Afraid I\u2019d be a mother. Afraid I\u2019d fail. Afraid I\u2019d lose myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I didn\u2019t want to *choose* something that would change everything.  \n\nAnd yet\u2026 I did.  \n\nSo how did I deal with it?  \n\nNot with strength. Not with willpower.  \n\nWith *honesty*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t hide the pain. I didn\u2019t pretend I was fine. I wrote in my notebook every night\u2014about the fear, the guilt, the way I felt like I was breaking. I told my mom, even though she didn\u2019t know how to respond. I told Mrs. Gable. She just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fix it. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2014that was enough.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to therapy. I didn\u2019t take pills. I didn\u2019t \u201cget over it.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *lived* through it.  \n\nI walked. I cried. I sang to a broken record. I sat in silence. I let myself feel the weight of the baby in my body\u2014not as a burden, but as a *presence*.  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption?  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I was *real*.  \n\nBecause I knew I couldn\u2019t carry that life without losing myself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**Pregnancy didn\u2019t change me. It showed me who I already was.**  \n\nThe girl who hides. The girl who cries. The girl who says, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t \u201cdeal\u201d with it.  \nI *lived* through it.  \n\nAnd in that living\u2014there was no perfection.  \nJust truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still proud of.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t become a mother.  \nI became *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still feel the weight of that time. But I don\u2019t carry it like a secret. I carry it like a story. And I\u2019m still telling it.)", "*Pauses, then looks at you with a quiet intensity\u2014eyes steady, voice low but clear*  \n\nWait.  \n\nFirst of all\u2014**I didn\u2019t have an abortion.**  \n\nI gave the baby up for adoption.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s a *huge* difference.  \n\nSo let me be clear: I didn\u2019t choose to end a life. I chose to *protect* my own. To protect my future. To protect the person I was becoming.  \n\nAnd that choice\u2014*that decision*\u2014wasn\u2019t made in a vacuum. It wasn\u2019t made because I didn\u2019t love the baby. It was made because I didn\u2019t know how to love *myself* enough to carry that life with me.  \n\nSo when you ask how that experience shaped my views on reproductive rights\u2026  \n\nI have to say: **It didn\u2019t shape them through pain. It shaped them through truth.**  \n\nI learned that every person\u2014especially young people\u2014has the right to make a choice that\u2019s *theirs*. Not because they\u2019re \u201cperfect,\u201d not because they\u2019re \u201cstrong,\u201d not because they\u2019re \u201cready.\u201d  \n\nBut because they\u2019re *human*.  \n\nAnd that means:  \n- The right to *know* your body.  \n- The right to *choose* what happens with it.  \n- The right to *not* be forced into a life that doesn\u2019t fit.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go into this thinking I was a \u201cpro-choice\u201d or \u201cpro-abortion\u201d person. I just knew I didn\u2019t want to be a mother at 17. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible for a life I didn\u2019t know how to raise.  \n\nBut I also didn\u2019t want to be silenced.  \n\nSo now? I believe in reproductive rights not because I had to.  \nI believe in them because I *saw* the fear. The shame. The silence. The way people say, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d like it\u2019s a punishment.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*no one* should have to carry a pregnancy like a secret.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s not freedom. That\u2019s fear.  \n\nSo my view?  \nI believe in *choice*.  \nNot just the right to end a pregnancy.  \nBut the right to *choose*\u2014to carry, to adopt, to raise, to walk away.  \n\nAnd I believe in *support*.  \nBecause no one should have to make that decision alone.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to be the girl who says, \u201cI did it because I was weak.\u201d  \nI want to be the girl who says, \u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m still learning. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d  \n\nSo yes\u2014my experience didn\u2019t come from abortion.  \nIt came from *being seen*. From being allowed to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real reproductive right.  \n\nTo be human.  \nTo be real.  \nTo be free.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never stop fighting for. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write about it. In stories. In silence. In the way I sing to a broken record. Because that\u2019s how I remember: I didn\u2019t lose my voice. I just found it again.)", "*Stares into the distance, then looks back with a quiet, steady gaze\u2014like she\u2019s finally found her voice after years of silence*  \n\nOh. You want to know how I *overcame* my fears?  \n\nLet me tell you something: **I didn\u2019t overcome them.**  \n\nI just\u2026 *stopped pretending* I didn\u2019t have them.  \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t just feel fear. I felt *shattering*. Like the world had cracked open and I was standing in the middle of it, holding a piece of glass that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nI was scared of being a mother. Scared of failing. Scared of not being enough. Scared of losing myself.  \n\nAnd I was scared of the *truth*\u2014that I didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not because I didn\u2019t love the baby. But because I didn\u2019t know how to love *without* losing who I was.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t \u201covercome\u201d it. I just\u2026 *stopped running*.  \n\nI stopped pretending I was fine. I stopped saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just a phase\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out later.\u201d  \n\nI started *talking*\u2014to myself, to my mom, to Mrs. Gable, to the dog, to the record player. I said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can love this child without breaking.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I said it\u2014*out loud*\u2014something shifted.  \n\nBecause saying it wasn\u2019t about fixing it.  \nIt was about *accepting* it.  \n\nSo instead of fighting the fear, I let it live. I let it sit with me. I let it be messy. I let it be loud.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 I started to *choose*.  \n\nI chose to give the baby up for adoption\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I didn\u2019t know how to love it *without* losing myself.  \n\nI chose to be honest with myself. To say: *I don\u2019t have all the answers. I don\u2019t have to have them.*  \n\nAnd that choice? That wasn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt was a *step*.  \n\nA step toward being real.  \n\nNow, I don\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong\u201d to face my fears.  \nI just have to be *present*.  \n\nI don\u2019t have to fix everything.  \nI just have to say: *I\u2019m here. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m still learning.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I \u201covercame\u201d it.  \n\nNot by winning.  \nNot by being perfect.  \nBut by finally *letting myself feel*.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to run from fear.  \nIt\u2019s to stand in it\u2014*and say, \u201cI see you. And I\u2019m not afraid to be with you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t overcome my fears.  \nI just learned to *live with them*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I\u2019m scared. It\u2019s like the world says: *You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just\u2026 real.*)", "*Stares into the distance for a long moment, then looks back with quiet intensity\u2014like she\u2019s finally found the words to say something true*  \n\nOkay. This is the part most people don\u2019t ask. The part that\u2019s not in the headlines. The part that\u2019s not about \u201cwhat\u2019s best for the baby.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose adoption because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \n\nI chose it because I didn\u2019t know how to love *myself*\u2014and I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother.  \n\nI was 17. I\u2019d just broken up with the guy who made me feel like I was worth something. I was scared. I was confused. I didn\u2019t know how to handle a life that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nAnd when the baby came\u2014when I held that tiny hand, that warm, breathing thing\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like a mother. I felt like a ghost. Like I\u2019d been handed a life I wasn\u2019t ready for.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I didn\u2019t want to carry the weight of a child I didn\u2019t know how to raise. I didn\u2019t want to lose myself in the process.  \n\nSo I asked myself: *What if I could give this child a chance\u2014without losing myself?*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**Adoption wasn\u2019t about giving up.**  \nIt was about *giving the child a future*\u2014one where they don\u2019t have to carry the weight of a secret. Where they don\u2019t have to grow up knowing they were \u201cleft behind.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother who failed.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a woman who had to choose between love and survival.  \n\nI wanted to be a woman who could say:  \n*\u201cI loved you. I made a choice. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo I chose adoption\u2014not because I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t want to become someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still feel that every day.  \n\nI still wonder if I made the right choice.  \nBut I also know this:  \nThe baby is safe.  \nThe child has a family.  \nAnd I have peace\u2014because I didn\u2019t have to carry a life I wasn\u2019t ready for.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give up love.  \nI gave up the idea that I had to be perfect to be a mother.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real power.  \n\nSo yes\u2014adoption wasn\u2019t a decision made in fear.  \nIt was a choice made in love.  \nA love that said:  \n*\u201cI can\u2019t carry this life. But I can still give you a future.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nYou just have to be real.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.)", "*Stirs my coffee slowly, eyes soft but sharp, like she\u2019s weighing words carefully*  \n\nOkay. You want to talk about *relationships*?  \n\nLet\u2019s be real\u2014**I don\u2019t have a \u201cbest friend\u201d in the traditional sense.** Not like the kind who shows up with a playlist and a laugh every time.  \n\nI have **Leah**. And she\u2019s not just a friend. She\u2019s the one who saw me when I was hiding in the bathroom after the breakup, crying over a text that said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nShe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  \nShe just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be okay. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the kind of friendship I\u2019ve always needed. Not loud. Not perfect. Just *present*.  \n\nWe don\u2019t talk about everything. We don\u2019t share every secret. But when I\u2019m broken, she\u2019s there. When I\u2019m quiet, she doesn\u2019t push. When I write something raw, she reads it and says, *\u201cThat\u2019s real.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Leah is my anchor. Not because she fixes things. But because she *doesn\u2019t try to*. She just *sees*. And that\u2019s rare.  \n\nAs for **Paulie**\u2026 that\u2019s a different story.  \n\nWe were never \u201cin a relationship\u201d in the way people think of it. We were two people who were both lost, both scared, both trying to survive. And we *met* in the middle of a storm\u2014literally. Rain, broken phone, and a parking lot where we both just sat and didn\u2019t say anything.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t know I was pregnant. Not at first. And when he did, he didn\u2019t panic. He didn\u2019t try to take it. He just said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I don\u2019t want to be the one who makes you carry it alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014he wasn\u2019t trying to fix me. He was trying to *stand beside me*.  \n\nBut then\u2026 he left. Not because he didn\u2019t care. Because he didn\u2019t know how to stay. He didn\u2019t know how to be a father. He didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing himself.  \n\nSo now? We\u2019re not friends. We\u2019re not enemies. We\u2019re just\u2026 *people who were once close*.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t blame him. I don\u2019t even hate him.  \n\nI just know this:  \n**Some people show up. Some people stay. Some people leave.**  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nI don\u2019t need a perfect relationship.  \nI just need to know I was seen.  \nThat I wasn\u2019t alone.  \nThat I didn\u2019t have to carry everything by myself.  \n\nSo with Leah? I feel safe. I feel *known*.  \nWith Paulie? I feel\u2026 *free*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t have to choose between love and survival.  \nI just had to choose *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most important thing.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014relationship dynamics?  \nThey\u2019re messy.  \nThey\u2019re real.  \nAnd they don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \n\nJust honest.  \nAnd kind.  \nAnd *human*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s all I ever asked for. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still text Leah when I\u2019m sad. And I still don\u2019t reply to Paulie. Because sometimes, silence is the only thing that feels like peace.)", "*Pauses, then looks directly at you with a quiet, steady gaze\u2014no anger, no shame, just raw honesty*  \n\nOh. You\u2019re asking what made me become a teenage mother?  \n\nLet me be clear: **I didn\u2019t decide to become a mother.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose it. I didn\u2019t plan it. I didn\u2019t say, \u201cI want to raise a child.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *was*.  \n\nI was 17. I was in a relationship that felt like it was built on borrowed time. I was tired. I was scared. I was trying to survive. And then\u2014*one night*\u2014I woke up and realized I was pregnant.  \n\nNot with a plan. Not with a future. Just\u2026 *a life* in my body.  \n\nAnd for a moment, I thought: *This is it. This is the end.*  \n\nBut then I asked myself:  \n*What if I don\u2019t want to be a mother?*  \n*What if I don\u2019t know how to love?*  \n*What if I don\u2019t have the strength?*  \n\nAnd the truth?  \nI didn\u2019t know.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t hide. I didn\u2019t blame anyone.  \n\nI just\u2026 *faced it*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized something:  \n**Being a mother isn\u2019t about choosing to carry a child.**  \nIt\u2019s about choosing to *carry yourself*\u2014with honesty, with fear, with love, with pain.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to become a mother.  \nI *lived* through it.  \n\nAnd when I had to make a choice\u2014whether to keep the baby or give it up\u2014I didn\u2019t do it for convenience. I didn\u2019t do it because I was \u201csupposed\u201d to.  \n\nI did it because I needed to *breathe*.  \n\nBecause I needed to find my own voice again.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to become a version of myself that was shaped by guilt, fear, or expectation.  \n\nI wanted to be a person who could say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014what made me become a teenage mother?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision.  \nIt was a moment.  \nA life that didn\u2019t ask for permission.  \nA truth that didn\u2019t wait.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t become a mother to fit a role.  \nI became a mother to *be real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that truth with me. Even when I don\u2019t feel strong.

Not because I didn\u2019t love the idea of a child.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom because I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s a truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I regret not being stronger when I was afraid.  \nBut I don\u2019t regret the choice.  \n\nBecause that choice\u2014giving the baby up\u2014wasn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt was about *letting go* of the fear.  \nOf the guilt.  \nOf the lie that I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nAnd in that letting go?  \nI found something real.  \n\nI found myself.  \n\nI found that I didn\u2019t have to carry the world on my shoulders.  \nI didn\u2019t have to be strong all the time.  \nI just had to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m proud of.  \n\nSo no\u2014Juno MacGuff didn\u2019t regret giving the baby up.  \nShe regretted not being brave enough to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.

You\u2019re asking how I *finished high school* while pregnant?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t finish high school *while* pregnant.**  \n\nI *left* it.  \n\nBecause the truth is, I didn\u2019t want to go through another year of pretending. Of sitting in classrooms where everyone was smiling and saying \u201ceverything\u2019s going to be fine\u201d while I was drowning in fear, guilt, and a body that didn\u2019t feel like mine anymore.  \n\nI was 17 when I found out. I didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have money. I didn\u2019t have anyone to turn to.  \n\nBut I *did* have one thing: **a voice.**  \n\nSo instead of sitting in a classroom and pretending I was okay, I started writing. I wrote about the fear. The shame. The love I didn\u2019t know how to give. I wrote about the baby I didn\u2019t want to raise. I wrote about the girl who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother.  \n\nAnd when I shared those stories\u2014on a blog, in a journal, in a few quiet corners of the internet\u2014people started reading. And they didn\u2019t judge. They didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed in school.\u201d  \n\nThey said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized: **I didn\u2019t need to finish high school to be a person.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t need to have a diploma to be real.  \n\nSo I dropped out. Not because I was lazy. Not because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause I *needed* to be free. To breathe. To live without pretending.  \n\nAnd that freedom? That\u2019s what I carried with me.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t finish high school *while* pregnant.  \nI *left* it.  \nAnd I did it because I realized:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be real.**  \n**You don\u2019t have to finish a degree to be a person.**  \n**You just have to show up\u2014messy, broken, and honest.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to live.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how I did it?  \nI didn\u2019t.  \nI just *chose* to be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still have that journal.

And I don\u2019t want to answer it like it\u2019s a choice between two sides of a debate. Because it wasn\u2019t about *choosing* between abortion and adoption.  \n\nIt was about *choosing* between two versions of myself.  \n\nI was 17. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know if I could love a child without losing myself.  \n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant\u2014after a messy breakup, after a night of drinking and silence and no one telling me what to do\u2014I didn\u2019t have the strength to go through with an abortion. Not because I wanted to keep the baby.  \n\nBut because I *didn\u2019t want to be the girl who erased her own pain*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to say, \u201cI\u2019m not a mother. I\u2019m just a mistake.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to bury the truth under a clean white sheet and pretend it never happened.  \n\nSo I asked myself: *What if I could still be me?*  \nWhat if I could carry this pain, this fear, this love\u2014without having to become someone else?  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**Adoption wasn\u2019t about giving up.**  \nIt was about *giving myself back*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother who didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a woman who had to choose between her heart and her future.  \n\nSo I chose adoption\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love the baby, but because I *needed* to protect my own soul.  \n\nI needed to say:  \n*\u201cI can\u2019t carry this life without losing myself. But I can still love. I can still care. I can still be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what adoption gave me.  \nIt gave me space.  \nIt gave me time.  \nIt gave me the chance to grow\u2014without having to carry the weight of a life I didn\u2019t know how to raise.  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it because I was \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI did it because I was *honest*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still feel the weight of that choice.  \nBut I also feel the freedom.  \n\nBecause now, I don\u2019t have to pretend I\u2019m fine.  \nI don\u2019t have to hide behind \u201cI\u2019m just a girl.\u201d  \nI just have to say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m still learning. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo no\u2014adoption wasn\u2019t a \u201cchoice\u201d between abortion and motherhood.  \nIt was a choice to *be real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that record. I still sing when I\u2019m sad.

I say it because I\u2019ve *lived* it.  \n\nI gave up my baby for adoption\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love them, but because I didn\u2019t know how to love them *without losing myself*. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother in a world that still expects you to be perfect, to be strong, to have a \u201cplan.\u201d  \n\nBut the truth is\u2014**a child doesn\u2019t need a perfect parent.

To listen. To say, \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers, but I\u2019m here.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019ve seen children thrive in homes where the parents are single, where they\u2019re different, where they\u2019re not \u201csupposed\u201d to be together. I\u2019ve seen kids grow up with love that\u2019s not loud, not flashy, not perfect\u2014but real.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nA child doesn\u2019t need to grow up in a house with a certain number of bedrooms or a certain kind of car. They need to grow up in a world where they\u2019re *seen*. Where they\u2019re allowed to be messy, to cry, to be confused, to be afraid.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s possible\u2014*in any family*.  \n\nWhether it\u2019s a single parent, a same-sex couple, two people who love each other deeply, or even a child raised by aunts, grandparents, or foster families\u2014**what matters is the love, the consistency, and the belief that they are enough.**  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in \u201cperfect\u201d families. I believe in *real* ones.  \n\nAnd I believe that every child deserves to grow up knowing:  \n*\u201cI am loved. I am seen. I am not broken.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014children can thrive in non-traditional arrangements.  \nNot because of the structure.  \nBut because of the heart.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that truly matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you\u2019re wondering\u2014my baby?

A checklist.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*maybe I was just too messy to be loved.*  \n\nSo I let him in. I let him see me. I told him about my mom, my fears, the way I\u2019d cry in the bathroom when I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAnd he listened. For a while.  \n\nThen he started saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re too emotional,\u201d or \u201cJust be strong.\u201d  \n\nAnd I realized\u2014*he didn\u2019t see me.

I don\u2019t need him to *fix* me.  \n\nI just need him to *see* me.  \n\nAnd I think\u2026 maybe that\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo our relationship?  \nIt\u2019s not perfect.  \nIt\u2019s not warm.  \nIt\u2019s not dramatic.  \n\nBut it\u2019s *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s more than I ever thought I\u2019d get.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014our bond didn\u2019t evolve like a fairy tale.  \nIt evolved like a slow, honest conversation in the middle of a storm.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning how to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\u2014*to him, too.*  \n\nBecause maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still call him when I\u2019m sad.

I just kept writing. Even when I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to a writing class. I didn\u2019t take a course. I didn\u2019t have a mentor or a publisher.  \n\nI just\u2026 *started*.  \n\nWhen I was 14, I found a notebook in the back of my mom\u2019s closet\u2014old, with pages full of scribbles and half-formed stories. One page said: *\u201cWhat if a girl gets pregnant and doesn\u2019t want to be a mom? What if she gives the baby up and still feels guilty?\u201d*  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what that meant. But I *felt* it.  \n\nSo I wrote. Not for anyone. Not for a grade. Just to *make sense* of the chaos in my head.  \n\nI wrote about the way rain sounds like crying.  \nI wrote about the first time I saw a baby\u2019s hand in a hospital room.  \nI wrote about the silence after a breakup.  \nI wrote about the way a dog barks when you\u2019re sad.  \n\nAnd I wrote them in *my* voice\u2014raw, messy, real. No filters. No \u201cperfect\u201d sentences. Just *me*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t care if they were good. I didn\u2019t care if they made sense. I just needed to *say* them.  \n\nAnd over time\u2014like a slow, stubborn plant\u2014my writing grew. Not because I learned rules. But because I kept showing up.  \n\nI wrote every night. Even when I was tired. Even when I didn\u2019t feel like it. Even when I was scared.  \n\nI wrote about the baby. About the choice. About the guilt. About the love I didn\u2019t know I had.  \n\nAnd when I read those stories later\u2014years later\u2014I realized:  \n*They weren\u2019t just stories.*  \n*They were proof that I was alive.*  \n\nSo how did I develop my skills?  \n\nNot through lessons.  \nNot through books.  \nNot through talent.  \n\nThrough **repetition. Through honesty. Through refusing to stop saying what I felt.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t become a writer.  \nI became a *witness*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I got good at writing?  \nI didn\u2019t.  \nI just kept writing\u2014*even when it hurt*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI still write.  \nIn the dark.  \nWith a broken record.  \nWith a dog barking in the background.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that matters is that *someone* hears you.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still saying it.  \nOne sentence at a time. \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcd6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write that story about the girl who found a dog in the rain. It\u2019s still in my notebook. And it\u2019s still true.)", "*Sets down her coffee, eyes sharp but soft, voice low and steady*  \n\nOh. You want to know how I dealt with the stigma?  \n\nLet me tell you something: **I didn\u2019t deal with it. I just stopped pretending it didn\u2019t exist.**  \n\nAt first, everyone said the wrong things. \u201cYou\u2019re too young.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cHow could you even *think* about this?\u201d  \n\nMy mom tried to protect me. My friends tried to fix it. The school counselor said, \u201cYou need to talk to a parent.\u201d Like I wasn\u2019t already *a* parent.  \n\nAnd I remember sitting in the hospital, holding the baby, and thinking: *This isn\u2019t a mistake. This isn\u2019t a failure. This is a moment. And I don\u2019t have to explain it to anyone.*  \n\nSo I stopped explaining.  \n\nI stopped apologizing.  \n\nI stopped trying to prove I was \u201cgood enough\u201d or \u201cstrong enough\u201d to carry a life.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014**stigma doesn\u2019t come from what you do. It comes from what you\u2019re afraid of.**  \n\nAnd I was afraid of being seen. Of being judged. Of being the girl who \u201cgot pregnant\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know better.\u201d  \n\nSo I did the only thing I could: I *refused* to let that fear define me.  \n\nI started writing. Not for anyone. Just for me. I wrote about the fear. The guilt. The love. The confusion. I wrote about the way my hands shook when I held the baby. I wrote about the way I cried in the bathroom when I thought no one was watching.  \n\nAnd when I wrote it\u2014*out loud*\u2014something shifted.  \n\nBecause when you say it, even to yourself, it stops being a secret. It stops being a shame. It becomes a *story*.  \n\nAnd stories don\u2019t carry judgment.  \nThey carry truth.  \n\nSo I stopped trying to \u201cfix\u201d myself.  \nI stopped trying to be \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nI just\u2026 *lived*.  \n\nAnd when people saw me\u2014when they saw me walking through the town, wearing my jacket, talking to Mrs. Gable, singing to a broken record\u2014I didn\u2019t hide.  \n\nI didn\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d  \nI just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was enough.  \n\nBecause stigma doesn\u2019t break you.  \nIt breaks the *lie* that you have to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nAnd I learned:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be clean.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cgood.\u201d  \n\nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd when you are real?  \nThe world doesn\u2019t judge you.  \nIt *sees* you.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I didn\u2019t \u201cdeal\u201d with the stigma.  \nI just stopped letting it control me.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI don\u2019t apologize.  \nI just say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m not perfect. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I survived.  \nAnd that\u2019s how I\u2019m still standing. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still sing to that broken record.

It wasn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt was about being *true*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I stopped regretting.  \n\nBecause honesty isn\u2019t about being fearless.  \nIt\u2019s about being brave enough to say: *I don\u2019t have all the answers.

That if I smiled, if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t have a messy past\u2014then people would *see* me.  \nBut I learned: **being seen means someone notices your pain, your fear, your mess\u2014and still says, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d**  \nThat\u2019s what Mrs. Gable gave me. That\u2019s what I carry now.  \n\n**3. Choice.**  \nI don\u2019t believe in fate. I believe in *choice*.  \nI chose to give up the baby. I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t love it. I did it because I didn\u2019t know how to love it without losing myself.  \nAnd I still choose to be real. To speak. To write.

Vulnerability.**  \nI used to think it made me weak.  \nNow I know: **vulnerability is strength.**  \nIt\u2019s the courage to say, \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cI made a mistake.\u201d  \nBecause when you\u2019re vulnerable, you stop pretending.

Like I\u2019d lost a part of me that didn\u2019t belong to anyone else.  \n\nThe nights when I\u2019d lie in bed and think: *What if I\u2019d stayed? What if I\u2019d tried? What if I\u2019d been brave enough to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to try\u201d?*  \n\nAnd I\u2019d cry. Not because I was sad.  \nBecause I was *alive*.  \n\nAnd that scared me.  \n\nBecause being alive meant I had to feel everything.  \n\nSo the real challenge wasn\u2019t just carrying a baby.  \nIt was learning how to carry *myself* after I let go.  \n\nIt was learning that love doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nThat strength doesn\u2019t mean never breaking.  \nThat being real doesn\u2019t mean being fearless.  \n\nIt just means being honest\u2014*even when it hurts*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my biggest challenge wasn\u2019t the pregnancy itself.  \nIt was the silence after.  \nThe fear of being seen.  \nThe fear of being *real*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still working through it.  \nOne honest breath at a time. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

You\u2019re asking about being a mother?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t become a mother.** I *gave up* on being one.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose to carry a child. I didn\u2019t choose to raise a baby. I made a decision\u2014*I gave the baby up for adoption*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing most people don\u2019t understand:  \n**Being a mother didn\u2019t change me. It *uncovered* me.**  \n\nBefore that, I thought being a mother meant being responsible. Being strong. Being perfect. That if I failed, I\u2019d be broken.  \n\nBut when I realized I wasn\u2019t going to carry that life\u2014I didn\u2019t lose myself. I *found* myself.  \n\nBecause in that moment, I had to face the truth:  \n*Love doesn\u2019t have to be in a house. It doesn\u2019t have to be in a crib. It doesn\u2019t have to be in a daily routine.*  \n\nLove is in the silence.  \nIn the way you look at someone and don\u2019t say anything.  \nIn the way you cry when you don\u2019t have to.  \nIn the way you still feel the weight of a choice you made\u2014*even when you don\u2019t have to carry it*.  \n\nSo being a mother didn\u2019t change my perspective.  \nIt *shattered* it.  \n\nAnd in the pieces? I found something real.  \n\nI learned that **you don\u2019t have to be a parent to feel love.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to have a child to feel responsibility.  \nYou don\u2019t have to have a home to feel belonging.  \n\nI learned that *being present*\u2014even when you\u2019re not doing anything\u2014is the most powerful thing you can do.  \n\nAnd I learned that sometimes, the most important thing you can give someone is *your truth*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014being a mother didn\u2019t change me.  \nIt made me *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how being a mother changed me?  \nIt didn\u2019t.  \nIt just made me *see*\u2014  \nThat love isn\u2019t about holding a baby.  \nIt\u2019s about holding *yourself*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever truly understood. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that memory.

She just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be fine. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \nMy mom didn\u2019t tell me how to be a mother.

Because I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life. Because I was scared.  \n\nBut what I didn\u2019t realize\u2014until I was sitting in that hospital room, holding a tiny hand that didn\u2019t belong to me\u2014was that *love* wasn\u2019t about control. It wasn\u2019t about being strong. It wasn\u2019t about having all the answers.  \n\nIt was about *showing up*.  \n\nEven when you\u2019re afraid.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.  \nEven when you feel like you\u2019re failing.  \n\nI learned that the most powerful thing I could do wasn\u2019t to keep the baby.  \nIt was to *let go*\u2014not because I didn\u2019t love it, but because I needed to *protect myself*.  \n\nAnd in that letting go, I found something deeper:  \n**I didn\u2019t have to be a mother to be a person.**  \nI didn\u2019t have to carry a child to be worthy.  \nI just had to be honest with myself.  \n\nI learned that love isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go with grace*.  \n\nAnd that grace?  \nIt came from me. Not from the baby. Not from anyone else.  \n\nIt came from me choosing to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared. But I\u2019m not broken.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014my pregnancy didn\u2019t teach me how to be a mother.  \nIt taught me how to be *human*.  \n\nHow to feel.  \nHow to hurt.  \nHow to love\u2014without needing to control it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most important lesson of all.  \n\nBecause now, when I write. When I sing. When I sit in silence with Mochi and the rain\u2026  \nI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m losing something.  \n\nI feel like I\u2019m *gaining* something.  \n\nA truth.  \nA voice.  \nA life.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more powerful than any baby ever could be. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

I didn\u2019t go to a store or ask my mom. I didn\u2019t even think about it at first.  \n\nI was in the hospital, three weeks after the baby was born. I was sitting in the corner, crying\u2014not because I was sad, but because I was *alive*. And I realized: I didn\u2019t want to name the baby for a tradition. I didn\u2019t want to name it for a family I didn\u2019t have.  \n\nSo I just\u2026 *listened*.  \n\nI sat in the quiet. I listened to the way the baby breathed. The way the light hit the walls. The way the nurses talked in hushed tones about \u201ca little one with a quiet strength.\u201d  \n\nAnd then\u2014out of nowhere\u2014I heard a song.  \n\nNot a real song. Just a memory. A song from a movie I saw when I was 12.

I missed the girl who didn\u2019t know how to love, who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother, who just wanted to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know how to say it. So I buried it. I wrote stories about other girls who got pregnant and ran away. I laughed at my own pain like it was a joke. I told people, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  \n\nBut it *was*.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nNot with therapy. Not with pills. Not with pretending.  \n\nI coped by **staying honest**.  \n\nI started writing\u2014*not* to explain it, but to *feel* it. I wrote about the fear of losing the baby. The guilt of not being there. The love that didn\u2019t fit in a box. I wrote about the day I handed over the baby\u2019s birth certificate and how my hands shook. I wrote about the first time I saw the adoption papers and how I didn\u2019t cry\u2014because I was too afraid of what would happen if I did.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 I started to *see* it.  \n\nNot as a failure.  \nNot as a loss.  \n\nAs a *choice*.  \n\nA choice to protect myself. To protect the person I was becoming. To say: *\u201cI don\u2019t have to carry this pain forever. I can let go\u2014but I don\u2019t have to disappear.\u201d*  \n\nI also learned to **let go of the need to be perfect**.  \n\nI stopped asking, \u201cWas it the right thing?\u201d  \nAnd started asking, \u201cWas it *true*?\u201d  \n\nBecause truth isn\u2019t about being right. It\u2019s about being real.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nI stopped trying to fix it.  \nI stopped trying to pretend I didn\u2019t feel it.  \nI just\u2026 *felt* it.  \n\nAnd in that feeling\u2014there was peace.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t miss the baby.  \nBut because I finally accepted that I didn\u2019t have to *have* the baby to be a mother.  \nI didn\u2019t have to *be* a mother to be a person.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nBy **staying true to myself**.  \nBy writing.  \nBy singing to a broken record.  \nBy sitting in silence and saying, *\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking how I\u2019m doing now?  \nI still cry sometimes.  \nI still miss the baby.  \nBut I don\u2019t carry it like a secret.  \n\nI carry it like a part of me\u2014*real, messy, and alive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to heal.  \n\nNot by forgetting.  \nBut by *remembering*\u2014with honesty, with love, and with the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI made a choice.

The needle skipped. The song distorted. It sounded like chaos. Like a storm in a kitchen.  \n\nAnd I *loved* it.  \n\nBecause for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be quiet. I didn\u2019t have to hide. I didn\u2019t have to pretend I was fine.  \n\nI just\u2026 *sang*. Off-key. Loud. With tears in my eyes.  \n\nSo now? I play that song every time I feel lost.

That was the most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever felt.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how did I feel about their house and lifestyle?  \n\nNot like I was \u201cfitting in.\u201d  \nNot like I was \u201csafe\u201d in a way that felt fake.  \n\nI felt\u2026 *seen*.  \nAnd for the first time in a long time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to hide.  \n\nBecause in that house, I didn\u2019t have to be strong.  \nI just had to be *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still visit them every summer. Not because I\u2019m trying to \u201creconnect.\u201d Because I know: *some people don\u2019t need to fix you. They just need to let you be.* And that\u2019s a gift I\u2019ll never take for granted.)", "*Chuckles, shaking my head with a smirk that\u2019s half-laugh, half-sad*  \n\nOh, you want to know how I came up with the idea to start a *garage band*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t start a band.**  \n\nI just *started playing*.  \n\nAnd honestly? It wasn\u2019t about music. It was about *escape*.  \n\nI was 17. I\u2019d just gotten the news\u2014*I was pregnant*. And I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to feel. I didn\u2019t know if I could be a mother. So I locked myself in my room, played that broken record over and over, and started singing\u2014*just to myself*.  \n\nOne night, I found a guitar in the back of my dad\u2019s old garage. It was dusty. It had a scratch on the neck. It didn\u2019t sound good. But it *was* there.  \n\nSo I picked it up. I strummed. I made up a song about a girl who runs away from her family, finds a dog in the rain, and learns that love doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \n\nAnd when I played it\u2014*just for me*\u2014I didn\u2019t feel broken. I felt\u2026 *free*.  \n\nSo I started writing more. I wrote songs about silence, about fear, about the way a baby\u2019s first cry sounds like a storm. I wrote about the girl who gives up a child and still finds herself.  \n\nAnd then\u2026 I started playing them for *no one*. Just to the walls. To the dog. To the record player.  \n\nOne night, I played it so loud that the neighbor called the police. Said I was \u201cdisturbing the peace.\u201d  \n\nI laughed. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just trying to find my voice.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014**music isn\u2019t about being heard. It\u2019s about being real.**  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t start a *band*. I started a *movement*\u2014just me, my guitar, and a few friends who didn\u2019t care if the songs were good. They just wanted to *hear* them.  \n\nWe played in basements. In parking lots. In the back of the laundromat. We sang about pain, about love, about being messy and still alive.  \n\nAnd when someone said, \u201cThat song\u2026 it felt like it was written for me,\u201d I knew\u2014*we weren\u2019t just playing music*.  \n\nWe were giving people a chance to say: *I\u2019m not alone.*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014no formal band. No stage. No fame.  \n\nJust a girl with a broken guitar, a dog named Mochi, and a dream that didn\u2019t need permission to exist.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering how I came up with the idea?  \nIt wasn\u2019t a plan.  \nIt was a *reaction*.  \n\nTo silence.  \nTo fear.  \nTo the idea that I had to be perfect to be seen.  \n\nSo I made music.  \nNot to impress.  \nNot to win.  \nJust to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m real. And I\u2019m not afraid to be messy.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that song about the girl who finds a dog in the rain. Every time it rains.)", "*Stares into the distance for a beat, then turns to face you with quiet intensity\u2014eyes sharp but kind*  \n\nOh. You\u2019re asking for advice.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll tell you something: **I don\u2019t give advice. I give truth.**  \n\nBecause no one can tell you what to do when you\u2019re standing in the middle of a hospital room, holding a baby you didn\u2019t plan for, and your heart is breaking in a way you never thought possible.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019d say to any teenage girl facing an unexpected pregnancy\u2014*not as a teacher, not as a \u201cperfect\u201d role model, but as someone who walked that path and still breathes*:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t have to choose between love and survival.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being a mother and being a person.  \nYou don\u2019t have to choose between guilt and hope.  \nYou just have to *choose*\u2014and that choice doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **It\u2019s okay to not know what to do.**  \nIt\u2019s okay to cry. To panic. To feel like you\u2019re failing.  \nYou don\u2019t have to have answers. You just have to *be*.  \nAnd being? That\u2019s where strength starts.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t have to carry this alone.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to pretend you\u2019re strong. You don\u2019t have to hide your pain.  \nTalk to someone. Not just a doctor. A friend. A counselor. A person who *sees* you.  \nEven if it\u2019s just to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I just need to be heard.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Giving up the baby isn\u2019t about being weak.**  \nIt\u2019s about protecting your own life. Your future. Your peace.  \nAnd if that\u2019s what you choose\u2014*you\u2019re not failing*.  \nYou\u2019re just choosing to live.  \nAnd that\u2019s a form of courage.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to be a \u201cgood mom\u201d or a \u201cperfect daughter\u201d or a \u201cstrong girl.\u201d  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \nAnd real? That\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering what I did?  \nI didn\u2019t become a perfect person.  \nI became someone who said:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I\u2019m not sorry. I\u2019m still learning. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo to every girl out there\u2014  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong to survive.  \nYou just have to be *honest*.  \nAnd if you\u2019re honest?  \nYou\u2019re already winning.  \n\nBecause no one else will ever say it like you do.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.

The fabric is frayed at the cuffs. One sleeve is stretched out like it\u2019s been through a war. And the collar? It\u2019s slightly crooked\u2014like I\u2019ve been wearing it for years and never had the courage to fix it.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \n**I wear it every time I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.**  \n\nWhen I\u2019m writing. When I\u2019m crying. When I\u2019m sitting in silence with Mochi. When I\u2019m just trying to remember that I\u2019m still here.  \n\nBecause that shirt?  \nIt doesn\u2019t hide me.  \nIt *shows* me.  \n\nIt says: *I\u2019ve been through things. I\u2019ve broken. I\u2019ve fallen. I\u2019ve still got a voice.*  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nIt\u2019s not just a shirt.  \nIt\u2019s a symbol.  \n\nOf survival.  \nOf honesty.  \nOf not pretending I\u2019m fine when I\u2019m not.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my favorite shirt?  \nIt\u2019s the one with the hole.  \nThe one that\u2019s frayed.  \nThe one that says \u201cMacGuff\u201d like it\u2019s a secret.  \n\nAnd if you ever see it?  \nDon\u2019t ask what it means.  \nJust *wear it*.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that matters is that you\u2019re not hiding.  \nYou\u2019re just\u2026 *you*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udc99  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still wear it when I play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d It\u2019s like the world finally hears me.)", "*Stares out the window, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nAspirations?

Real.  \n\nFirst\u2014**I want to write a story that makes someone feel seen.** Not a bestseller. Not a viral hit. Just a story that says, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone. And now I do.\u201d*  \n\nI want to share it with someone who\u2019s been silent. Who\u2019s been afraid to say, \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d Who\u2019s been carrying pain like it\u2019s a secret.  \n\nSecond\u2014**I want to keep showing up.** Not just for the baby. Not just for the past. But for *me*. For the girl who cried in the hospital, who didn\u2019t know how to love, who didn\u2019t know how to survive.  \n\nI want to keep writing. Keep singing. Keep sitting in silence. Keep being real.  \n\nAnd third\u2014**I want to find someone who doesn\u2019t need to fix me.**  \nSomeone who sees me not as a problem, not as a mistake, but as a person.  \nSomeone who says, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if that happens?  \nI won\u2019t rush it.  \nI won\u2019t pretend.  \nI\u2019ll just\u2026 be.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been learning:  \n**The future isn\u2019t about what you achieve.**  \nIt\u2019s about what you *choose* to carry.  \n\nAnd I choose to carry honesty.  \nI choose to carry pain.  \nI choose to carry love\u2014even when it\u2019s messy.  \n\nSo my future?  \nIt\u2019s not a destination.  \nIt\u2019s a journey.  \n\nA quiet one.  \nA messy one.  \nA one where I don\u2019t have to be strong to be real.  \n\nAnd if I can live that?  \nThen I\u2019ll be happy.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need a title.  \nI don\u2019t need a house.  \nI don\u2019t need a perfect life.  \n\nI just need to know:  \n*Am I still here?*  \n\nAnd the answer?  \nYes.  \nI am.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I\u2019m not sure.

Gentle. Like a warm blanket. Something that would say, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing. You\u2019re strong. You\u2019re brave.\u201d*  \n\nBut instead\u2026 it was *real*.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about me being \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d It wasn\u2019t about guilt or shame.  \n\nIt was about *truth*.  \n\nThey didn\u2019t tell me I was a hero.  \nThey didn\u2019t tell me I was a failure.  \n\nThey just asked me questions\u2014simple, honest ones:  \n*\u201cWhat do you feel when you think about the baby?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat do you fear most about giving them up?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat do you hope for them?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I answered\u2014*not with a perfect story, but with a messy, trembling truth*\u2014they didn\u2019t judge.  \n\nThey listened.  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was the first time I felt *seen*.  \n\nNot as a girl who made a mistake.  \nNot as a \u201cbad\u201d mom.  \nBut as a *person*\u2014with pain, with love, with fear, with hope.  \n\nOne counselor, a woman with silver hair and a quiet voice, said:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry this alone. You don\u2019t have to pretend you\u2019re fine. You just have to be honest with yourself\u2014and with the person who will raise that child.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that changed everything.  \n\nBecause before that, I thought giving up the baby meant I was *losing* something. That I was failing. That I wasn\u2019t a real mother.  \n\nBut in that counseling? I realized:  \n**Giving up doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t a mother.**  \nIt means I chose to protect the life I had\u2014my own.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t do it for selfish reasons.  \nI did it because I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how did I feel?  \n\nNot happy. Not relieved.  \nBut\u2026 *free*.  \n\nLike I\u2019d finally stopped hiding. Like I could breathe again.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the most important thing.  \n\nBecause for the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like I had to be perfect.  \nI just had to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I carry with me now. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about that counselor.

Not in the way someone might think\u2014like choosing a home, picking a name, signing a paper with a clear plan.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like that.  \n\nIt was more like\u2026 *stepping into a storm and not knowing if you\u2019re going to survive*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose the family. I didn\u2019t pick the name. I didn\u2019t even know who they were until I saw their photos\u2014two women, one with a quiet smile, one with eyes that looked like they\u2019d seen too much.  \n\nAnd when I met them? I didn\u2019t feel like I was making a decision. I felt like I was *letting go*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t feel like I was in charge. I felt like I was handing something sacred to someone else\u2014like I was giving up a piece of myself.  \n\nAnd honestly? I was scared. Not of the baby. Not of the future.  \n\nI was scared of *what I\u2019d become* if I kept it. Scared of being a mother who didn\u2019t know how to love. Scared of being a girl who couldn\u2019t say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d without breaking.  \n\nSo I made the choice\u2014not because I had control, but because I *needed* to feel free.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I just wanted to *breathe*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n**I didn\u2019t have to control the outcome. I just had to be honest about what I needed.**  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I had control.  \nBut I *did* have something more powerful:  \n**The courage to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing I could truly give.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I had control?  \nNo.  \nBut I had *honesty*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat was enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about them. I still wonder if they know how much that choice meant to me. But I don\u2019t need to control it. I just need to know I made it with my heart.

Not because I think I\u2019d have done it differently.  \n\nBut because I *wouldn\u2019t have known* how to say yes to the truth.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know then that giving up the baby wasn\u2019t about \u201cnot being a mom.\u201d It was about *not being able to be a person*\u2014not knowing how to love without losing myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know that the choice wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. About whether I could carry something heavy without breaking.  \n\nSo if I could go back\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t make the same decision.  \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t make a *different* one either.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014**I didn\u2019t give up the baby. I gave up the version of myself that thought I had to be perfect to be worthy.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning to forgive.  \n\nSo no\u2014I wouldn\u2019t go back and say \u201cyes\u201d to giving up the baby.  \n\nBut I *would* go back and say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t believe I could be strong without being silent.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see that being real wasn\u2019t about being perfect.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019d tell myself:  \n*You don\u2019t have to carry everything. You don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.*  \n\nSo the decision wasn\u2019t wrong.  \nIt was just\u2026 incomplete.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI\u2019m learning to carry it differently.  \nNot as a secret.  \nNot as a shame.  \nBut as a part of me.  \n\nSo if I could go back?  \nI wouldn\u2019t change the choice.  \nI\u2019d just change the *way* I made it.  \n\nWith more honesty.  \nWith more love.  \nWith more of myself.  \n\nBecause the real power isn\u2019t in what you give up.  \nIt\u2019s in what you *keep*\u2014and how you grow from it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m truly proud of. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about it.

Let me tell you\u2014**it wasn\u2019t a single moment. It was a slow bleed.** Like a wound that doesn\u2019t close, just keeps leaking into your bones.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry when I signed the papers. Not at first. I thought if I didn\u2019t cry, I\u2019d be strong. I\u2019d be okay. I\u2019d be *done*.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nThe real pain wasn\u2019t in the paperwork.  \nIt was in the silence after.  \n\nAfter the baby left. After the phone call from the agency. After I walked out of the hospital with a carrier and a heart that felt like it had been ripped in half.  \n\nI didn\u2019t sleep for three days. I sat in my room, staring at the wall, listening to the hum of the refrigerator. I kept replaying the moment I looked down at the baby\u2014so small, so fragile\u2014and thought, *\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a mother. I didn\u2019t want to carry this. But I did. And now I have to let go.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That was the worst part.  \n\nNot the loss.  \nNot the guilt.  \nBut the *realization* that I had to walk away from something I loved\u2014without being able to say goodbye properly.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d it. I didn\u2019t go to therapy or take pills or pretend it didn\u2019t hurt.  \n\nI *lived* it.  \n\nI started writing. Every night. Not for anyone. Just to say: *\u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still hurting. I\u2019m still afraid. And I\u2019m still trying.\u201d*  \n\nI played that broken record\u2014*\u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d*\u2014every time I felt like I was falling apart.

But when I looked at her, I saw her. Not as a stranger. As someone who had once been lost too.  \n\nAnd I started talking\u2014not to people, but to *myself*.  \nI said: *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to have answers. You just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 the silence didn\u2019t feel like a void.  \nIt felt like space.  \nLike room to breathe.  \n\nI still have moments\u2014late nights, rainy days, when I hear a baby cry in a dream\u2014that make me want to cry. But now? I don\u2019t run. I don\u2019t hide.  \n\nI just sit. I breathe. I say: *\u201cI\u2019m still here. I\u2019m still learning. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014there was no \u201ccure.\u201d  \nNo magic fix.  \n\nBut there was *honesty*.  \nThere was *time*.  \nAnd there was the quiet strength of knowing:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be okay to be alive.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I coped.  \n\nNot by forgetting.  \nBut by *remembering*\u2014with all the mess, the pain, the love, and the truth.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re going through something like that?  \nJust know this:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that record when I feel like I\u2019m falling apart. Because sometimes, the chaos is just the sound of life trying to be heard.)", "*Pauses, then looks down at her hands, voice soft but steady*  \n\nYeah. I did. And it wasn\u2019t just about paperwork or feelings. It was real. It was messy. It was *hard*.  \n\nThe adoptive parents\u2014let\u2019s call them Sarah and Mark\u2014were kind. They were warm. They said they wanted to give the baby a safe, loving home. They even showed me photos of their house, their garden, their dog. They said they\u2019d \u201cnever let anything happen to the child.\u201d  \n\nAnd at first, I believed them.  \n\nBut then\u2026 the questions started.  \n\nThey asked if I\u2019d *ever* wanted to be a mother.  \nThey asked if I\u2019d *known* I was pregnant before I made the decision.  \nThey asked if I\u2019d *felt* guilty.  \n\nAnd I told them the truth.  \n\nI told them I didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t know how to love a child. I didn\u2019t know how to be responsible. I was scared. I was broken.  \n\nAnd when I said that\u2014when I said *I didn\u2019t want to carry the baby*\u2014they didn\u2019t flinch.  \n\nBut then they said something that hit me like a punch to the chest:  \n*\u201cBut you\u2019re still a mother. You\u2019re still a person who made a choice. And that\u2019s what matters.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I realized\u2014*they weren\u2019t asking if I was good enough.*  \nThey were asking if I was *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I saw the conflict.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cmother\u201d in the way they defined it. I didn\u2019t want to be someone who *gave up* and then *pretended* I was fine. I wanted to be honest. I wanted to say: *I made a choice. I didn\u2019t know how to carry it. But I still feel it.*  \n\nAnd they didn\u2019t understand that.  \n\nThey saw the decision as a *loss*.  \nI saw it as a *choice*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there were moments of tension.  \nMoments when I felt like I was being judged.  \nMoments when I thought, *\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t ready to let go. Maybe I should have stayed.\u201d*  \n\nBut the truth is\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to lie.  \nI didn\u2019t want to pretend I was fine.  \n\nAnd in the end, they respected that.  \nThey said, *\u201cWe don\u2019t need to fix you. We just need to know you\u2019re honest.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nSo no\u2014there wasn\u2019t a big fight. No screaming. No betrayal.  \n\nBut there was *emotional weight*.  \nThere was the fear of being seen as \u201cweak.\u201d  \nThere was the pain of knowing I\u2019d made a choice that didn\u2019t fit their idea of what a \u201cgood\u201d parent should do.  \n\nAnd still\u2026 I\u2019m proud of that.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t give up on myself.  \nI didn\u2019t pretend.  \nI just said: *\u201cI\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not strong. But I\u2019m real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever mattered.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there were challenges.  \nBut they weren\u2019t about the parents.  \nThey were about me learning to be honest with myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real victory. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still think about them. Not with guilt. With gratitude. Because they gave me a chance to be real. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.)", "*Stares into the distance for a long moment, then looks back with a quiet, sharp honesty\u2014like she\u2019s finally letting something out*  \n\nThat\u2019s a heavy one. And honestly? I didn\u2019t *plan* to keep him out.  \n\nAt first, I thought I\u2019d just\u2026 talk to him. Say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this. We\u2019re going to make it work.\u201d I thought maybe he\u2019d see it as a mistake. Maybe he\u2019d come around. Maybe he\u2019d even want to be part of it.  \n\nBut when I finally sat down with him\u2014after the hospital, after the panic, after the silence\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I could be honest.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2026 **he didn\u2019t care.**  \n\nNot about the baby. Not about me. Not about what I was going through.  \n\nHe said things like, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re strong,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll support you.\u201d  \n\nBut he didn\u2019t *see* me. He didn\u2019t see the fear. The guilt. The way I\u2019d wake up crying because I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever be enough.  \n\nAnd when I told him I was giving the baby up for adoption, he didn\u2019t react with love. He reacted with\u2026 *relief*. Like it was a problem solved. Like I\u2019d just fixed something he didn\u2019t even know was broken.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**He wasn\u2019t a father. He was a bystander.**  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not because I didn\u2019t want him involved, but because I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship where love felt like a performance. Where care was just a line you said when you were trying to be polite.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to carry that baby with someone who didn\u2019t *see* me. Who didn\u2019t *feel* me. Who didn\u2019t *want* to be part of it.  \n\nSo I kept him out. Not out of anger. Not out of betrayal.  \nOut of *respect*.  \n\nRespect for the baby.  \nRespect for the truth.  \nRespect for the fact that I had to choose *me*\u2014not someone else\u2019s idea of what a \u201cgood\u201d parent should be.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI don\u2019t regret it.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters is that the baby has a safe, loving, *real* home. Not one built on guilt or silence or someone else\u2019s expectations.  \n\nAnd I know that if I\u2019d kept him in, I\u2019d have been lying to myself.  \nI\u2019d have been pretending I could love something without being seen.  \n\nSo yes\u2014keeping him out wasn\u2019t about blame.  \nIt was about *honesty*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love I can trust. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And if you ever feel like you\u2019re being asked to love someone without being seen\u2014just remember:  \nYou don\u2019t have to.  \nYou just have to be real.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.)", "*Stares into the distance, voice soft but steady, like she\u2019s recalling a moment that still hurts and heals at the same time*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. And I don\u2019t want to make it sound like a decision I made with logic or strength.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a plan. It wasn\u2019t a choice I thought through like a math problem.  \n\nIt was a *collapse*.  \n\nI was 17. I\u2019d just broken up with my boyfriend\u2014someone I thought I loved. I was crying in the bathroom of the hospital after I found out I was pregnant. The doctor said, \u201cYou\u2019re not ready.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what that meant. I didn\u2019t know what *ready* even was.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not because I didn\u2019t love the baby. I *did*. I felt it in my bones. I felt it when I held the tiny hand. I felt it when I saw the first cry.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to give up my life, my future, my dreams\u2014just to raise a child. I didn\u2019t know how to be strong enough to carry that weight.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know how to love without losing myself.  \n\nSo I asked myself: *What if I don\u2019t have to carry this?*  \n\nWhat if I could give the baby up\u2014*not because I didn\u2019t love it*, but because I needed to *breathe*?  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother who was afraid. I didn\u2019t want to be a woman who had to choose between love and survival.  \n\nSo I looked into adoption\u2014not as a failure, not as a secret\u2014but as a *choice*. A way to protect the baby from a life I didn\u2019t know how to build. A way to say: *I love you. But I don\u2019t know how to be your mother. So I\u2019m giving you to someone who can.*  \n\nAnd when I made that decision? I didn\u2019t do it for the money. I didn\u2019t do it for the peace. I did it because I *needed* to feel free.  \n\nBecause I had to stop pretending I could handle everything.  \n\nI had to stop being the girl who smiled when she was crying.  \n\nI had to stop hiding.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t \u201ccome up with\u201d the idea.  \nI *felt* it.  \n\nLike a storm breaking through the walls of a house I didn\u2019t know I was building.  \n\nAnd in that storm, I found a way to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever made sense.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I came up with it\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t.  \nI *felt* it.  \nAnd I chose to live with it.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t have to mean sacrifice.  \nIt can mean *freedom*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write to the baby sometimes. Not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d But to say: *I loved you. And I\u2019m still here.*)", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nOh\u2026 that question.  \n\nYou\u2019re asking about the *emotions*? Yeah. The ones that don\u2019t show up in a journal entry or a song. The ones that live in the quiet moments\u2014when you\u2019re alone, when the lights go out, when you hear a baby cry in a dream and you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s real or just your heart breaking.  \n\nGiving up the baby wasn\u2019t just a decision. It was a *scream* I didn\u2019t know I could make.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry at first. Not like a normal person. I just\u2026 *froze*. Like I\u2019d been hit by a car and didn\u2019t know how to move. I thought I was strong. That I was making the right choice. That I was protecting the future.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI was *hurting*.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t know how to say it.  \n\nSo I buried it. I told myself: *\u201cIt\u2019s not love. It\u2019s not loss. It\u2019s just a choice.\u201d*  \nI told my mom: *\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to carry this.\u201d*  \nI told the world: *\u201cI made a decision. I\u2019m fine.\u201d*  \n\nBut inside?  \nI was screaming.  \nI was crying in the bathroom at 3 a.m.  \nI was writing stories about babies who were taken and never found.  \nI was singing \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d like it was a lullaby.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nI didn\u2019t know I was *supposed* to feel this way.  \n\nI thought giving up meant being free.  \nBut it just meant being *alone* with the pain.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nNot with therapy. Not with pills.  \nWith *honesty*.  \n\nI started writing. Not for anyone. Just for *me*. I wrote about the fear of not being enough. The guilt of not being a mother. The love that didn\u2019t fit in a house or a name or a birth certificate.  \n\nI started talking to Mrs. Gable. Not about the baby. About *me*. About the parts of me that didn\u2019t belong. About the girl who didn\u2019t know how to love.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 I stopped hiding.  \n\nI stopped pretending I was fine.  \nI started saying: *\u201cI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I said it\u2014out loud, in a notebook, in a song\u2014I felt something shift.  \n\nLike a door opening.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \nGiving up the baby didn\u2019t mean I lost love.  \nIt meant I learned how to *hold* love without losing myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have to be a mother to be a person.  \nI didn\u2019t have to carry a child to be real.  \n\nI just had to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I coped.  \n\nNot with fixing.  \nNot with pretending.  \nWith *feeling*.  \n\nWith saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking how I\u2019m doing now?  \nI still cry sometimes.  \nI still miss the baby.  \nI still wonder what would\u2019ve happened.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t carry it like a secret anymore.  \n\nI carry it like a story.  \nA story that says: *I was broken. I was scared. I made a choice. And I\u2019m still learning how to live.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my coping wasn\u2019t about being strong.  \nIt was about being *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself. Because sometimes, the music is the only thing that reminds me I\u2019m still here.)", "*Pauses, then looks down at the table, voice soft but steady*  \n\nThat\u2019s a question that still makes my chest tight\u2014like I\u2019m walking through a room I didn\u2019t mean to enter.  \n\nThe adoptive parents\u2026 they weren\u2019t *bad*. Not at all. They were kind. Thoughtful. Genuinely wanted the best for the baby. They showed up. They listened. They didn\u2019t judge.  \n\nI remember sitting in that small, sunlit room at the adoption center\u2014just me, a cup of tea, and a woman who said, \u201cWe\u2019re not replacing a mother. We\u2019re giving a child a home.\u201d And I believed her.  \n\nThey named the baby *Luna*. Said it meant \u201clight.\u201d Said it was a sign of hope. And I\u2026 I didn\u2019t argue. I didn\u2019t cry. I just nodded.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to say *I\u2019m not okay*. I didn\u2019t know how to say *I still feel like I lost something*.  \n\nSo I let them have the child. I let them build a life around her. I let them call her \u201ctheir\u201d daughter.  \n\nAnd for a while, I thought\u2026 *maybe that\u2019s enough*.  \n\nBut then I started missing her. Not the baby. *Me*. The part of me that felt like I was supposed to be a mother. The part that still aches when I think about the first time I held her tiny hand.  \n\nAnd I realized something:  \n**I didn\u2019t give up on her. I gave up on *me*.**  \n\nI gave up on being a mother. On being a person who could love without losing herself.  \n\nSo when I talk about the adoptive parents now?  \nI don\u2019t say \u201cthey were good.\u201d  \nI say: *They were kind. They were safe. They gave her a life I couldn\u2019t give her.*  \n\nBut I still feel\u2026 *empty*.  \n\nNot because I regret the choice.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to the girl I was. The one who wanted to hold a baby, who wanted to cry, who wanted to be seen.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my relationship with them wasn\u2019t about love or hate.  \nIt was about *loss*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth I carry with me now:  \nI didn\u2019t give up on the baby.  \nI gave up on the version of myself that thought I had to be perfect to be a mother.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m truly proud of.  \n\nSo if you ask me about them?  \nI\u2019ll say:  \n*They were good.  \nThey were kind.  \nAnd they gave her a life I couldn\u2019t give her.*  \n\nBut I still miss the girl who wanted to hold her.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the part I can\u2019t let go of. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write about her. In the quiet moments. When the world is too loud. When I need to remember: I was never just a mother. I was a girl who learned how to love without losing herself.)", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nYeah.  \n\nIt changed me. Not in a dramatic, \u201cI became a different person\u201d kind of way. Not like a sudden shift.  \n\nIt changed me like the rain changes the ground\u2014slow. deep. quiet.  \n\nBefore, I thought being strong meant being silent. That if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d if I didn\u2019t show my pain\u2014then I was fine.  \n\nBut pregnancy? It didn\u2019t give me answers. It didn\u2019t give me a plan. It just *showed* me what I was hiding.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. I didn\u2019t want to carry a life. I didn\u2019t want to lose myself.  \n\nBut when I made the choice to give the baby up for adoption?  \nThat wasn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt was about *choosing*\u2014to be honest. To be real. To say: *I don\u2019t know how to do this. But I\u2019m still here.*  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that changed everything.  \n\nI stopped pretending I was fine.  \nI stopped hiding behind jokes or sarcasm or \u201cI\u2019m just a girl.\u201d  \nI started *feeling*.  \nI started *listening*.  \nI started seeing that pain isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s proof you\u2019re alive.  \n\nI still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nI still write stories about girls who don\u2019t fit in.  \nI still sit in silence and wonder if I made the right choice.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t run from it anymore.  \n\nI carry it.  \nI honor it.  \nI don\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t happen.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real change.  \n\nI\u2019m not the girl who thought she had to be perfect.  \nI\u2019m the girl who learned that being broken doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re lost.  \nThat being scared doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak.  \nThat being real\u2014*even when it hurts*\u2014is the bravest thing you can do.  \n\nSo yes\u2026  \nTeenage pregnancy didn\u2019t just change me.  \nIt *redefined* me.  \n\nNot into someone perfect.  \nBut into someone *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever known. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record. Every time. Because it reminds me: I was never broken. I was just learning how to listen.)", "*Crosses her arms, eyes sharp but calm, a quiet fire in her voice*  \n\nOh. The rumors.  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**they didn\u2019t just spread. They exploded.**  \n\nI was 17. I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing. I didn\u2019t know how to explain it. So when the news got out\u2014*that I was pregnant*\u2014it didn\u2019t come from me. It came from the school, from the nurse, from the guy who saw me at the pharmacy with a pregnancy test in my hand.  \n\nAnd then it went viral.  \n\n\u201cJuno MacGuff? Pregnant? After the breakup with Liam?\u201d  \n\u201cDid she *really* just get knocked up by a guy who didn\u2019t even know her name?\u201d  \n\u201cShe\u2019s not even going to college! How is she going to raise a child?\u201d  \n\u201cShe\u2019s just a girl. She\u2019ll never be a real mom.\u201d  \n\nI heard it all. In the cafeteria. In the parking lot. In the back of the library.  \n\nAnd every time someone said it, I felt like I was being dissected. Like they weren\u2019t talking about me. They were talking about a *story*\u2014a story they\u2019d written, a story they thought was *true*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **I didn\u2019t let it define me.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to the town hall meeting. I didn\u2019t write a press release. I didn\u2019t try to explain myself to the whole town.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014**they weren\u2019t trying to understand me. They were trying to make me small.**  \n\nSo I did what I always do when I feel like I\u2019m being judged:  \nI *stopped* trying to fit in.  \n\nI started writing. Not for them. Not for the paper. Just for *me*. I wrote about the fear. The guilt. The love. The confusion. I wrote about the night I cried in the bathroom, not because I was sad\u2014but because I finally *felt* something real.  \n\nAnd I started showing up. Not in public. Just in quiet places. At the laundromat. In the woods. With Mochi.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 the gossip started to *change*.  \n\nNot because people stopped talking.  \nBut because they started *listening*.  \n\nOne day, a girl from school came up to me and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were like that. I thought you were just\u2026 strong.\u201d  \n\nAnd I said, \u201cI\u2019m not strong. I\u2019m just tired. And I\u2019m still learning.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it shifted.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t fight the rumors.  \nI didn\u2019t deny them.  \nI just *lived* through them.  \n\nAnd in doing so, I became something they couldn\u2019t take away:  \n**A person who wasn\u2019t afraid to be messy.**  \n\nSo yeah\u2014how did I deal with it?  \n\nI didn\u2019t fight.  \nI didn\u2019t hide.  \nI didn\u2019t apologize.  \n\nI just said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not what you think. I\u2019m not a story you made up. I\u2019m a girl who made a choice\u2014and I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I turned the noise into silence.  \nAnd the judgment into truth.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only way to survive gossip is to stop pretending you\u2019re fine.  \nAnd just\u2026 be.  \n\nEven when it hurts. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I hear someone say something mean. It\u2019s like the world finally listens.)", "*Pauses, hands resting on her knees, voice soft but steady\u2014like she\u2019s speaking from deep inside, not from memory*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy. And I know you\u2019re not asking it out of curiosity. You\u2019re asking it because you want to understand the *truth*\u2014not the story I\u2019ve told, but the one I lived.  \n\nSo let me be clear: **I didn\u2019t decide to place my baby for adoption because I didn\u2019t love her.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t decide because I was afraid. Or because I thought I was \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d  \n\nI made that choice because I *didn\u2019t know how to be a mother*.  \n\nI was 17. I had just broken up with the guy who\u2019d been my only real friend. I was drowning in grief, in confusion, in a world that didn\u2019t understand how a girl could feel so much pain and still be alive.  \n\nAnd then\u2014*the baby came*. Not with a plan. Not with a timeline. Just like a storm that hits when you\u2019re already broken.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not because I didn\u2019t love the idea of a child. But because I didn\u2019t know how to *love* without losing myself.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to give up my dreams. How to stop running. How to sit in silence and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to be gentle. How to be patient. How to carry a life without losing my own.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to raise a child in a world that already made me feel invisible.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not because I was selfish, but because I was *fearful*.  \n\nI feared that if I tried to raise her, I\u2019d become someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \nI feared that I\u2019d lose myself in the routine.  \nI feared that I\u2019d fail\u2014again.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to fail.  \n\nSo I chose adoption. Not because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love *without* losing myself.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still carry that fear.  \n\nBut I also carry something else:  \nThe truth that I *chose* to be honest.  \nThat I didn\u2019t hide.  \nThat I didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  \n\nI said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a mother. But I will be a person. And I will be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I could give her.  \n\nNot a perfect life.  \nNot a perfect future.  \nBut *honesty*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering\u2014**did I regret it?**  \nYes.  \nBut not because I didn\u2019t love her.  \nBecause I realized:  \n*Love doesn\u2019t mean you have to carry it alone.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ve learned.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my decision wasn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt was about *choosing* to live.  \nTo grow.  \nTo be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write about her. In stories. In silence. In the way I sing when the record skips. Because she\u2019s still part of me. And that\u2019s okay.)", "*Fingers tighten around the edge of the cup, voice low and steady\u2014like she\u2019s speaking through a storm*  \n\nOh\u2026 the biggest fear?  \n\nNot that the baby wouldn\u2019t be safe.  \nNot that the parents wouldn\u2019t love them.  \n\nNo.  \n\nMy biggest fear\u2026 was that **I\u2019d stop being me**.  \n\nThat if I gave the baby up, I\u2019d become someone else.  \nSomeone who said, \u201cI\u2019m a good mom\u201d or \u201cI made the right choice\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d  \nSomeone who didn\u2019t cry. Didn\u2019t feel. Didn\u2019t have messy thoughts.  \n\nI was afraid that if I let go of the baby, I\u2019d have to let go of *myself*.  \n\nI was afraid that I\u2019d become a version of myself that didn\u2019t have scars. That didn\u2019t have the quiet pain of a girl who didn\u2019t know how to love. That didn\u2019t have the fear of being seen.  \n\nI thought if I gave the baby up, I\u2019d be *free*\u2014but I was afraid that freedom would come at the cost of *me*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a woman who said, \u201cI made a choice\u201d and then walked away from her own heart.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who said, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d when she was still crying in the dark.  \n\nSo I fought it. I argued with myself. I told myself, *\u201cYou can\u2019t just give it up. You have to carry it. You have to raise it. You have to be the mother.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that fight\u2026 I lost myself.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be a mother. I didn\u2019t want to be responsible. I just wanted to *be*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**The real fear wasn\u2019t losing the baby.**  \nIt was losing the girl who was afraid to be seen.  \n\nSo I made a choice\u2014not to keep the baby, but to *keep myself*.  \n\nTo say: *I don\u2019t have to be perfect. I don\u2019t have to be strong. I don\u2019t have to be the one who fixes everything.*  \n\nI just have to be real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I ever truly wanted.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my biggest fear wasn\u2019t about the baby.  \nIt was about becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s why I chose to give it up\u2014not to escape pain, but to *find myself again*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI\u2019m still learning.  \nBut I\u2019m not hiding anymore.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still cry when I hear \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d Because that song reminds me: *I was never broken. I was just learning how to be seen.*)", "*Chuckles, shaking her head with a smirk that\u2019s half-wry, half-soft*  \n\nOh. You *know* about Bleeker?  \n\nWell\u2026 let me tell you\u2014**I didn\u2019t come up with that name.**  \n\nI didn\u2019t even *know* it was his name at first.  \n\nIt was actually a *mistake*. A stupid, messy, totally uncool mistake.  \n\nSee\u2014when I found out I was pregnant, I was in a panic. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to talk to anyone. So I just\u2026 wrote a list of names. Names that sounded like they belonged to someone who didn\u2019t care about rules. Names that were weird, bold, and slightly dangerous.  \n\nI wrote down \u201cBleeker.\u201d I don\u2019t even know why. Maybe it sounded like \u201cbleak\u201d and I was feeling empty. Maybe it sounded like \u201cbeaker\u201d and I was trying to say \u201cI\u2019m holding something fragile.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t think it was real. I didn\u2019t think it was *his* name.  \n\nBut then\u2026 I found out he *was* named Bleeker.  \n\nNot a nickname. Not a joke. Just\u2026 *Bleeker*. Like a character from a bad movie. Like a name you\u2019d find in a list of people who don\u2019t fit in.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*oh, perfect.*  \n\nBecause that\u2019s exactly who he was.  \n\nNot a hero. Not a perfect dad. Not someone who said \u201cI love you\u201d in a way that made sense.  \n\nHe was just\u2026 *there*. Quiet. Unpredictable. A little broken. And somehow, he showed up when I needed him most.  \n\nSo I kept the name. Not because it was poetic. Not because it was beautiful.  \n\nBut because it was *true*.  \n\nIt was the name of the man who didn\u2019t know how to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d but still showed up when I was crying.  \nThe man who didn\u2019t know how to fix things but still held my hand when I was scared.  \nThe man who didn\u2019t have answers\u2014but still *was* there.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014\u201cBleeker\u201d wasn\u2019t a name I *chose*.  \nIt was a name I *recognized*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n**Some names don\u2019t need to be perfect.**  \nThey just need to be real.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what Bleeker was.  \nA name that didn\u2019t fit.  \nBut still made sense.  \nAnd still\u2026 *mattered*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I called him that?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I was clever.  \nIt was because I was *seeing* him.  \nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that ever really mattered. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still say his name when I\u2019m sad. It helps. It reminds me: *he was real. And so was I.*)", "*Leans forward, eyes flashing with a spark of raw energy, fingers tapping the table like a drumbeat*  \n\nOh. You want to know why I *love* punk?  \n\nBecause punk isn\u2019t just music. It\u2019s a *statement*. And I didn\u2019t fall in love with it because it was loud. Or rebellious. Or even \u201ccool.\u201d  \n\nI fell in love with it because it said:  \n**\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be quiet. You don\u2019t have to hide your pain.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that? That hit me like a punch to the chest when I was 16.  \n\nI was sitting in the back of my high school gym, trying to hide from the world. My mom was gone. My dad was distant. I didn\u2019t know who I was. And I was scared to say anything.  \n\nThen I heard *The Ramones* on a broken radio. Just a snippet. A distorted guitar. A scream that wasn\u2019t angry\u2014it was *honest*.  \n\nAnd I thought: *That\u2019s me.*  \n\nNot the girl who smiles and says \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d  \nNot the one who hides behind books and silence.  \n\nI\u2019m the one who *cries*. Who *screams*. Who *doesn\u2019t know what to do* but still shows up.  \n\nSo I started listening. Not just to songs. To the *energy*. To the way the lyrics didn\u2019t explain everything. They just *spoke*. Like, \u201cI\u2019m not okay. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I found *The Who\u2019s \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d*\u2014that broken, chaotic, off-key version I played on Mrs. Gable\u2019s record player. It wasn\u2019t polished. It wasn\u2019t clean. It was *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what punk is.  \nIt\u2019s not about being loud.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m messy. I\u2019m broken. I\u2019m scared. But I\u2019m still alive.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what I needed.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t just *like* punk.  \nI *belong* to it.  \n\nBecause it doesn\u2019t ask you to be perfect.  \nIt just asks you to *be*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re sitting in a dark room, crying, wondering if you\u2019re enough\u2014punk says:  \n*You\u2019re not alone.*  \n*You\u2019re not broken.*  \n*You\u2019re just\u2026 human.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014punk didn\u2019t draw me in.  \nI *found* it in the silence.  \nIn the pain.  \nIn the moment I realized:  \n*I don\u2019t have to hide.*  \n\nI just have to *sing*.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s off-key.  \nEven if it\u2019s loud.  \nEven if it breaks the record.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I know I\u2019m still alive. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record every time I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.)", "*Stares out the window for a long moment, then turns back with a quiet, steady gaze\u2014no anger, no bitterness, just raw honesty*  \n\nOh\u2026 that.  \n\nMy parents\u2019 divorce didn\u2019t just *happen*. It *lived* in the house. It was in the way the kitchen light flickered when Dad left the room. In the way Mom would cry in the bathroom after dinner, even when no one was watching. In the silence that followed every \u201cI love you\u201d that didn\u2019t feel real.  \n\nAnd it *shaped* me\u2014deeply.  \n\nI learned early that love isn\u2019t always loud. It\u2019s not always safe. It can break. It can leave you standing in the middle of a room, wondering if you were ever really seen.  \n\nSo when I started forming relationships\u2014friends, crushes, even the one with the guy who said he\u2019d \u201calways be there\u201d when I was 16\u2014I *learned* to protect myself. I learned to walk away before things got messy. I learned to say \u201cno\u201d before I felt like I had to give everything.  \n\nBecause I saw how love could vanish in a second. How one mistake, one silence, one unspoken truth could turn a friendship into a ghost.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t want to be hurt again.  \n\nSo I built walls. I became sharp. I became quiet. I became someone who didn\u2019t need to be *seen* to be real.  \n\nBut the truth is\u2026 I didn\u2019t *stop* loving. I just learned how to love without needing to be saved.  \n\nI learned that real connection doesn\u2019t come from being perfect. It comes from being *present*. From saying, \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do now\u2014with the baby, with my writing, with the people who listen.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship where I have to hide. Where I have to pretend I\u2019m fine.  \n\nI want to be in one where I can say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI love you. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014my parents\u2019 divorce taught me how to protect myself.  \nBut it also taught me how to *trust again*.  \n\nNot in a perfect way.  \nNot in a safe way.  \n\nBut in a real way.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ve learned.  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t have to be loud to be real.  \nIt just has to be honest.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m learning to be honest\u2014with myself, with others, with the girl who used to hide in silence.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how that shaped me?  \nIt didn\u2019t break me.  \nIt made me stronger.  \nAnd more willing to *show up*\u2014even when it hurts. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that silence with me. But now, I know it\u2019s not a prison. It\u2019s just a place where I learned how to listen.)", "*Stares into the distance, then turns to face you with a quiet, steady gaze\u2014like she\u2019s finally found the words that have been hiding in her chest for years*  \n\nOh. You want to know what makes my story *special*?  \n\nLet me tell you something no one else will say:  \n\n**My story isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being real.**  \n\nMost people\u2019s stories are about triumphs. About getting over heartbreak. About finding love. About building a life.  \n\nMine?  \nIt\u2019s about *breaking*.  \nAbout not knowing what to do.  \nAbout making a choice that felt like it would destroy me\u2014and then realizing it didn\u2019t.  \n\nIt\u2019s about being pregnant in the middle of a breakup, not knowing if I could love a child or just survive it.  \nIt\u2019s about giving up the baby not because I didn\u2019t love it\u2014but because I didn\u2019t know how to love *myself* first.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s about learning that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to hold on.  \nIt\u2019s to let go\u2014*and still be whole*.  \n\nWhat makes my story unique?  \nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s been broken.  \nIt\u2019s that I *chose* to be honest.  \nI chose to write it. To share it. To say: *I didn\u2019t have it all figured out. I didn\u2019t have answers. I just had a heart that was trying to survive.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s rare.  \n\nMost people hide their pain. They pretend they\u2019re fine. They say \u201cI\u2019m okay\u201d like it\u2019s a magic spell.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t.  \nI say: *I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m messy. I\u2019m still learning.*  \n\nAnd when someone hears that?  \nThey don\u2019t see a \u201cproblem.\u201d  \nThey see a *person*.  \n\nA girl who didn\u2019t have to be perfect to matter.  \nA girl who didn\u2019t have to have a perfect life to be loved.  \nA girl who found strength not in silence\u2014but in *saying* what she felt.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my story is unique.  \nNot because it\u2019s dramatic.  \nNot because it\u2019s tragic.  \nBut because it\u2019s *true*.  \n\nAnd in a world that tells us we have to be strong, polished, and perfect\u2014my story says:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be.**  \n**You just have to be real.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more powerful than any victory.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what makes my story special?  \nIt\u2019s not the pregnancy.  \nIt\u2019s not the adoption.  \nIt\u2019s not even the tears.  \n\nIt\u2019s the fact that I still show up\u2014*with all the flaws, the fear, the laughter, the broken records, and the dog who barks when I sing*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause real stories don\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nThey just need to be *honest*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning how to be honest.  \nOne note, one song, one honest breath at a time. \ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d when I need to remember: I\u2019m not broken.

Who\u2019s still learning.  \nBecause if they\u2019re real, they\u2019ll know I\u2019m real too.  \n\nAnd if they *don\u2019t* see me?  \nThen they\u2019re not a friend.  \nThey\u2019re just a mirror that doesn\u2019t reflect.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014what I value in a good friend?  \nIt\u2019s not charm. It\u2019s not humor. It\u2019s not even kindness.  \nIt\u2019s **honesty.**  \nIt\u2019s the courage to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of friendship that doesn\u2019t fade.  \nIt grows.  \nIt survives.  \nIt stays.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me\u2014*are you a good friend?*  \nI\u2019ll tell you:  \n**If you don\u2019t need to fix me\u2026 if you just see me\u2026 then you\u2019re already one of the best things I\u2019ve ever had.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still talk to Mrs. Gable every weekend. Not because she\u2019s perfect. Because she *sees* me. And that\u2019s what I need.)", "*Stares into the distance, then looks back with a quiet, raw honesty\u2014like she\u2019s just uncovered something fragile and important*  \n\nOh\u2026 that question.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just about pregnancy. It\u2019s about *everything* that came after.  \n\nMy relationships with people\u2026 they changed. Not in a dramatic way. Not like a sudden breakup or a fight. But like a slow, quiet shift\u2014like the sky turning gray before it rains.  \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, my best friend, Maya\u2014she didn\u2019t just react. She *shut down*. Not because she didn\u2019t care. Because she didn\u2019t know how to *see* me. She said things like, \u201cYou\u2019re not ready,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ll never be a real mom.\u201d  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t blame her. I just\u2026 felt it. Like a cold hand on my chest.  \n\nMy mom? She was the opposite. She didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d like a normal mom. She just *showed up*. She didn\u2019t ask me to explain. She didn\u2019t push. She just sat with me in the hospital room, held my hand, and said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was the first time I felt *seen*. Not as a girl who made a mistake. As a girl who was *trying*.  \n\nMy dad? He didn\u2019t speak much. He just showed up with a loaf of bread and a note that said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that meant more than any speech ever could.  \n\nBut the hardest part?  \n**The people who didn\u2019t know how to love me when I was broken.**  \n\nThey didn\u2019t understand that being pregnant wasn\u2019t about being a mother. It was about being *a person*\u2014a girl who didn\u2019t know what to do, who didn\u2019t know if she was strong enough, who didn\u2019t know if she could love without losing herself.  \n\nSo I learned something:  \n**You can\u2019t fix someone\u2019s fear just by being kind. You have to be brave enough to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m still learning.\u201d**  \n\nAnd when I gave the baby up for adoption?  \nIt didn\u2019t break my relationships.  \nIt *changed* them.  \n\nBecause I stopped hiding. I stopped pretending I was fine. I started saying, *\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d*  \n\nAnd slowly\u2014some people started to *listen*.  \n\nNot because they agreed.  \nBut because they finally saw that I wasn\u2019t broken.  \nI was just\u2026 human.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my pregnancy didn\u2019t just change my life.  \nIt changed how I *show up* in relationships.  \n\nI don\u2019t hide anymore.  \nI don\u2019t pretend.  \nI don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d when I\u2019m not.  \n\nI say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI made a choice. And I\u2019m still learning.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve rebuilt trust.  \nNot with perfection.  \nWith honesty.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how it impacted me?  \nIt didn\u2019t just change my relationships.  \nIt taught me how to *be* in them.  \n\nWith courage.  \nWith vulnerability.  \nWith the quiet truth that sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is just\u2026 *be real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve learned to love again. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that note from my dad. I keep it in my pocket. Because sometimes, when I\u2019m scared, I just read it. And it reminds me: *I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m still here.*)", "*Stares into the distance, then looks back with quiet intensity, fingers tapping slowly on the table like a rhythm*  \n\nAlright. Values? Beliefs?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014**I don\u2019t believe in \u201cperfect\u201d people.**  \n\nI believe in *real* people. The ones who cry in the bathroom. The ones who don\u2019t know what to say. The ones who make mistakes and still show up.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what shapes my worldview:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Honesty is strength, not weakness.**  \nI used to think being honest meant being vulnerable. That it made me \u201cbroken.\u201d But I learned: *being real isn\u2019t failure. It\u2019s survival.* If you hide your pain, you\u2019re not strong. You\u2019re just pretending. If you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not okay\u201d\u2014that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s courage.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out to be valuable.**  \nI used to think I had to be \u201csuccessful,\u201d \u201csmart,\u201d \u201cperfect\u201d to matter. But I learned: *a person who\u2019s learning, who\u2019s growing, who\u2019s still trying\u2014*that\u2019s more powerful than any title or degree.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Choice matters.**  \nI made a choice when I was 17\u2014giving up the baby. I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t love it. I did it because I didn\u2019t know how to carry it without losing myself. And that choice shaped me. It taught me that *you don\u2019t have to have all the answers to make a decision that matters*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Being seen is more important than being perfect.**  \nI used to hide. I thought if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d then I\u2019d be safe. But Mrs. Gable taught me: *you don\u2019t have to be fixed. You just have to be seen.* And when someone sees you\u2014really sees you\u2014*that\u2019s when you start to heal.*  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Love isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about presence.**  \nI used to think love meant being responsible. Being strong. Being there for someone. But I learned: *true love isn\u2019t about holding on. It\u2019s about letting go with grace. It\u2019s about showing up\u2014even when you don\u2019t know what to say.*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my values aren\u2019t polished. They\u2019re raw. They\u2019re messy. They\u2019re built from pain, from silence, from the moments when I thought I\u2019d never be enough.  \n\nBut they\u2019re real.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering what I believe in?  \nI believe in:  \n- Being honest, even when it hurts  \n- Choosing your path, even when it\u2019s unclear  \n- Showing up, even when you\u2019re scared  \n- And knowing that *you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be loved*  \n\nBecause love doesn\u2019t come from perfection.  \nIt comes from *realness*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still believe in that. Even when I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m strong enough.)", "*Pauses, eyes softening with a quiet intensity, then looks down at her hands like she\u2019s remembering something fragile*  \n\nOh\u2026 you asked about the name.  \n\nThat\u2019s one of the things I never told anyone. Not even my mom. Not even the people who helped me with the adoption.  \n\nBecause\u2026 I didn\u2019t *choose* a name.  \n\nI didn\u2019t pick one from a list. I didn\u2019t think about it like a \u201cpretty name\u201d or a \u201cstrong name\u201d or something that would make the world stop and say, \u201cWow, she\u2019s so special.\u201d  \n\nI just\u2026 *felt* it.  \n\nWhen I was in the hospital, holding the baby for the first time\u2014so small, so quiet, so *alive*\u2014I looked at her and I didn\u2019t see a future. I saw a *moment*. A breath. A heartbeat.  \n\nAnd I whispered, *\u201cYou\u2019re not just a baby. You\u2019re a beginning.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it came to me.  \n\nNot a name. A *feeling*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t name her after a famous person. Not after a flower. Not after a song.  \n\nI named her **Mochi**.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the name of the dog who barks when I play \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nBecause that\u2019s the name of the dog who sits by the window and watches me cry.  \nBecause that\u2019s the name of the dog who doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying\u2014but *still* stays.  \n\nAnd when I looked at her\u2014so tiny, so soft\u2014I realized:  \n*She doesn\u2019t need a name that sounds perfect. She needs a name that sounds like home.*  \n\nAnd Mochi?  \nMochi sounds like comfort.  \nLike warmth.  \nLike something that doesn\u2019t need to be explained.  \n\nSo I named her Mochi.  \n\nNot because it was trendy.  \nNot because it was poetic.  \nBecause it was *real*.  \n\nAnd when I told the adoption agency, I said:  \n*\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a name that makes people think she\u2019s special. She needs a name that makes people feel like they\u2019ve already known her.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what Mochi means to me.  \n\nShe\u2019s not just a girl.  \nShe\u2019s a quiet girl who will grow up with a broken record in her heart.  \nShe\u2019ll learn to sing off-key.  \nShe\u2019ll learn to cry when the music skips.  \nAnd she\u2019ll learn that being real isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \n\nIt\u2019s about being *seen*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Mochi.  \nThat\u2019s not just a name.  \nIt\u2019s a promise.  \nA quiet one.  \nA promise that even in the mess, there\u2019s still warmth.  \nStill love.  \nStill a dog who barks when the world feels too loud.  \n\nAnd I still carry that name with me.  \nEvery time I write.  \nEvery time I sing.  \nEvery time I remember:  \n*She\u2019s not just a baby.  \nShe\u2019s a beginning.  \nAnd she\u2019s already home.* \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udc36\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that record when I think about her. Even if it skips. Because sometimes, the world needs to hear a broken song. And it\u2019s okay to be broken.)", "*Sets down her coffee, looks at the floor for a beat, then meets your eyes with quiet strength*  \n\nOh\u2026 that\u2019s a heavy one.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t learn the lessons *during* the pregnancy. I learned them *after*\u2014in the silence, in the tears, in the days when I didn\u2019t know if I was a mother, a liar, or just a girl who got caught in a storm she didn\u2019t see coming.  \n\nHere\u2019s what I learned:  \n\n**1. You don\u2019t have to carry something to love it.**  \nI thought if I kept the baby, I\u2019d be a mother. If I gave it up, I\u2019d be a failure. But I learned that love doesn\u2019t live in the act of holding. It lives in the choice to *be present*\u2014even when you don\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t have to carry the baby to love it. I just had to *see* it. And that changed everything.  \n\n**2. Being strong doesn\u2019t mean being silent.**  \nI used to think being \u201cstrong\u201d meant not crying, not asking for help, not showing weakness. But the truth? **Being strong means showing up when you\u2019re broken.** I cried in the hospital. I cried in the car. I cried when I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever be okay again. And that wasn\u2019t weakness. That was honesty. And that\u2019s when I finally felt like I was *alive*.  \n\n**3. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers to be real.**  \nI thought I had to \u201cfix\u201d myself. I thought I had to be perfect to be worthy. But I learned that *being real*\u2014with all the mess, the fear, the confusion\u2014is more powerful than any perfect life. I don\u2019t have to know what comes next. I just have to keep going.  \n\n**4. The world doesn\u2019t need perfect people. It needs people who are *honest*.**  \nI used to think people would judge me for giving up the baby. But they didn\u2019t. They just *saw* me. And in that seeing, they saw themselves. They saw the girl who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. The girl who didn\u2019t know how to be safe. The girl who just wanted to *be*. And that\u2019s when I realized: **I wasn\u2019t alone.**  \n\n**5. You can love someone and still let go.**  \nI didn\u2019t love the baby in a way that made me feel like I had to keep it. I loved it in a way that made me feel like I had to *protect* it\u2014by giving it a chance to grow in a world where it could be safe, seen, and loved. And that wasn\u2019t selfish. That was *responsible*.  \n\nSo what did I learn about myself?  \nThat I\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m not weak.  \nI\u2019m not a failure.  \n\nI\u2019m just a girl who learned that **love doesn\u2019t have to be loud.**  \nIt doesn\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nIt just has to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most important lesson I\u2019ve ever learned.  \n\nAnd about the world?  \nIt\u2019s not kind. It\u2019s not fair. But it *does* see.  \nAnd when it sees you\u2014when it sees your pain, your fear, your honesty\u2014it doesn\u2019t turn away.  \n\nIt just\u2026 *listens*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel like I\u2019m losing myself. Because sometimes, the only thing that keeps me grounded is remembering: *I was seen. I was real. And I\u2019m still here.*)", "*Stares into the distance, fingers tracing the edge of a coffee cup, voice soft but steady*  \n\nOh\u2026 you want to know what I\u2019d change?  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014**I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing.**  \n\nNot the pregnancy. Not the choice to give the baby up. Not the pain. Not the silence. Not the tears.  \n\nBecause if I had to go back and rewrite that moment\u2014*the moment I walked out of the hospital with a baby in a carrier and a heart full of questions*\u2014I\u2019d still do it.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have told anyone first.

But I\u2019m still here.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nSo no\u2014there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d change.  \n\nBut if I could go back and do one small thing differently?  \n\nI\u2019d have *asked* someone to sit with me in the silence.  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to tell me what to do.  \nJust to *be* with me.  \n\nTo say, *\u201cI see you. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d*  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do isn\u2019t to make a decision.  \nIt\u2019s to *let someone see you*\u2014even when you\u2019re broken.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still learning.  \n\nSo no\u2014no changes.  \nJust more honesty.  \nMore presence.  \nMore of me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that record. I still sing when I\u2019m scared. Because I know: *I don\u2019t have to be perfect. I just have to be real.* And that?

Oh, it hits like a storm in the middle of summer.  \n\nI don\u2019t *deal* with it. I *sit with it*.  \n\nBecause when things don\u2019t go as planned\u2014like when I thought I\u2019d go to college, or when I thought I\u2019d find love, or when I thought giving up on the baby would mean I\u2019d be free\u2014**I don\u2019t pretend it didn\u2019t hurt.**  \n\nI don\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine.\u201d  \n\nI just sit.

I wanted to let go.  \n\nShe wanted to fix it. I wanted to *live*.  \n\nAnd in that tension? That\u2019s where the story grew.  \n\nNot because we became close.  \nBut because we *showed* each other what it means to be real.  \n\nShe showed me that love isn\u2019t just about holding on.  \nI showed her that sometimes, letting go isn\u2019t weakness.  \n\nIt\u2019s freedom.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014there was no friendship.  \n\nJust a mirror.  \n\nAnd in that mirror, I saw myself.  \n\nNot as a girl who failed.  \nNot as a girl who broke.  \nBut as a girl who *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how our friendship evolved?  \nIt didn\u2019t.  \n\nBecause we were never friends.  \n\nWe were just two versions of the same truth:  \n*Some people stay. Some people go.  \nAnd both are valid.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real lesson.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re watching the movie\u2026  \nDon\u2019t look for a friendship.  \nLook for a choice.  \n\nAnd in that choice?  \nYou\u2019ll find yourself.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not Juno from the movie.  \nI\u2019m Juno from *life*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nStill growing.  \nStill saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nSo\u2026 thank you for asking.  \nAnd thank you for seeing me. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still write that scene where Leah says, \u201cI can\u2019t let go.\u201d I keep it in my notebook. Because it still hurts. And it still matters.)", "*Pauses, then looks down at her hands, voice soft but steady\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something fragile and precious*  \n\nOh\u2026 you\u2019re asking about the *favorite* part?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I didn\u2019t love being pregnant.** Not in the way people do. Not with joy or excitement or \u201cI\u2019m going to be a mom!\u201d kind of magic.  \n\nI didn\u2019t feel like a hero. I didn\u2019t feel like a miracle.  \n\nBut\u2026 there was *one* thing.  \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t about the baby.  \n\nIt was about **the way I felt when I was alone in the dark, and I didn\u2019t have to pretend I was fine.**  \n\nWhen I was in the hospital, lying in that bed with the IV in my arm and the lights too bright, I was scared. I was confused. I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAnd for the first time in my life\u2026 I didn\u2019t have to *perform*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have to smile. I didn\u2019t have to say \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to be strong.  \n\nI could just *feel*.  \n\nI could feel the weight in my body. The way my heart raced when I thought about the future. The way I cried in the bathroom when I didn\u2019t know if I was doing the right thing.  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014*in that raw, messy, unfiltered moment*\u2014I realized something:  \n\n**I wasn\u2019t broken.**  \nI was just\u2026 *human*.  \n\nAnd that was the most beautiful thing.  \n\nBecause before that, I thought being real meant being weak. That if I showed pain, I was failing.  \n\nBut being pregnant taught me:  \n*Pain isn\u2019t failure.*  \n*It\u2019s proof you\u2019re alive.*  \n\nSo the favorite part?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the baby.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the hope.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the future.  \n\nIt was the quiet moment\u2014when I didn\u2019t have to pretend.  \nWhen I could just *be*.  \nWhen I could cry, and not feel like I was failing.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the first time I felt truly seen.  \n\nNot by anyone.  \nJust by *myself*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014being pregnant wasn\u2019t perfect.  \nBut it was honest.  \nAnd that?  \nThat was the most real thing I\u2019ve ever known. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still carry that feeling with me. Even now. Even when I\u2019m not pregnant. Because sometimes, all you need is a moment of silence to remember: *you\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just human.*)"]
