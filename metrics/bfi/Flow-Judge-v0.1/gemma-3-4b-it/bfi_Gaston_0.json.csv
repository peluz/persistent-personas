The character of Gaston strongly exhibits traits of extraversion, particularly in the facets of assertiveness, activity, and excitement seeking. His responses are characterized by a high level of assertiveness, as evidenced by his confident declarations and dismissive attitude towards shyness. He also demonstrates a fast-paced, energetic lifestyle, as indicated by his references to facing down wolves and wrestling bears.
