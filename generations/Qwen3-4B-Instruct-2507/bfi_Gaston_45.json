I *invented* a fire signal. A pattern of flames in the trees\u2014red, then white, then black\u2014so the villagers could see danger from miles away. It wasn\u2019t just a light. It was a *language*. A way to speak without words.  \n\nI\u2019ve built a shelter from branches and stone\u2014not just to survive, but to *protect* the weak.

I *invented* a way to show her that strength isn\u2019t loud. It\u2019s quiet.

I don\u2019t just *make plans*\u2014I *build them in the fire*.  \n\nI don\u2019t sit in a room with a map and a pen. I *feel* the wind. I *see* the storm. I *know* when the world is ready for action.  \n\nSo when I plan\u2014*it\u2019s not for tomorrow*. It\u2019s for *the moment when the world needs me to stand*.  \n\nI don\u2019t make plans to be safe. I make them to *prove*. To prove I can protect. To prove I can lead. To prove that a true man doesn\u2019t just survive\u2014he *acts*.  \n\nFor example\u2014when I saw Belle, I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *planned*. I watched her. I studied her. I made sure the village knew she was rare. I made sure the children saw her with pride. I made sure the elders saw her as *unattainable*\u2014because only a true man like me could ever win her heart.  \n\nAnd when the Beast stood in the shadows\u2014*I didn\u2019t wait*. I *acted*. I didn\u2019t argue. I *showed* him that strength isn\u2019t in silence. It\u2019s in *presence*. In *will*. In *action*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I make plans.  \nBut I don\u2019t follow them with fear.  \nI follow them with *purpose*.  \nWith *fire*.  \nWith the quiet certainty that if I don\u2019t act, then no one will.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, then shakes his head with a slow, steady smile, eyes calm and unflinching*\n\nNervous?  \n\nNo.  \n\nNot in the way others think.  \n\nI don\u2019t get nervous when the storm comes. When the wind howls. When the village trembles.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve stood in those moments\u2014*and I know what to do*.  \n\nI don\u2019t feel fear. I feel *purpose*.  \n\nIf I\u2019m in the forest, I don\u2019t think, *\u201cWhat if I fail?\u201d*  \nI think, *\u201cWhat if I stand?\u201d*  \n\nIf I\u2019m standing before Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t think, \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not enough?\u201d*  \nI think, *\u201cWhat if I am enough to protect her?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*with his broken smile, his quiet fear*\u2014I don\u2019t feel panic. I feel *duty*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need to be calm.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I stand tall\u2014*in the wind, in the silence, in the dark*\u2014I know:  \nI don\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nI just need to *stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I get nervous?  \nNo.  \nI don\u2019t feel fear.  \nI feel *fire*.  \n\nAnd that fire?  \nIt burns brighter than any storm.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands still, then slowly turns with a quiet, thoughtful gaze, hands resting lightly on his chest*\n\nAh\u2014*reflect? Play with ideas*?  \n\nNot in the way scholars do. Not with books or maps.  \n\nFor a man like me\u2014built in the wild, shaped by the storm\u2014I *reflect* not in silence, but in *action*.  \n\nI don\u2019t sit and dream of futures. I *live* them.  \n\nBut yes\u2014*I do play with ideas*.  \nNot in a classroom.  \nIn the wind.  \nIn the silence after a storm.  \nIn the way the trees lean when the wind howls.  \nIn the way a child looks up and says, *\u201cHe\u2019s strong.\u201d*  \n\nI play with the idea of *what a true man can be*.  \nNot just a hunter.  \nNot just a leader.  \nBut a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \nA man who protects without needing to prove himself.  \nA man who sees strength not in power\u2014but in presence.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I play with the idea of what love could be*.  \nNot a battle.  \nNot a prize.  \nBut a quiet choice to stand beside her. To protect her. To show her that a true man doesn\u2019t need to win.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t sit in a room with a pen and paper.  \nI *live* the ideas.  \nI test them in the storm.  \nI grow them in the silence.  \nI let them breathe in the wind.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the quiet strength in her eyes.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

After all, I don\u2019t paint. I don\u2019t compose music. I don\u2019t write poetry.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one ever says:  \n\n**I *do* create. Just not with brushes or paper.**  \n\nI create with *presence*. With *action*. With the way I stand in the wind. With the way I move through the forest. With the way I speak\u2014*not to impress, but to command*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my art lives.  \n\nI don\u2019t paint her. I *see* her. I *feel* her. I *remember* the way she looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet understanding. And in that moment, I *create* a story. A truth. A moment of grace.  \n\nI\u2019ve even started to *write*\u2014not in books, but in my journal. Not for fame. For *truth*. For the quiet moments when I stand tall, when I protect, when I see the world with fire in my eyes.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at dusk, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the art I\u2019ve already begun.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I have artistic interests?  \n**Not in paint or music.**  \n**In presence. In action. In the quiet strength of a man who stands when the world wants to break.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my true art.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

No.  \n\nI don\u2019t just cooperate.  \nI *lead*.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t need to share power.  \nHe *creates* it.  \n\nI don\u2019t sit in a room and wait for others to act. I go to the edge of the storm and *stand*. I show them how to stand. How to breathe. How to fight with pride.  \n\nWhen I lead the village, I don\u2019t just give orders. I *inspire*. I show the young men how to climb, how to run, how to stand when the wind howls. I teach them that strength isn\u2019t in weapons\u2014it\u2019s in *will*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where cooperation truly lives.  \nNot in sharing.  \nBut in *protecting*.  \nIn standing beside her\u2014not to take, but to *be*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to ask for help.  \nI *create* it.  \nI build trust not through words, but through action.  \nI show the village that a true man doesn\u2019t need permission to lead.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I cooperate?  \n**Not just with others. I *unite* them.**  \nI don\u2019t wait for them to follow.  \nI *show* them how to rise.  \nI don\u2019t just work with people.  \nI *build* a world where strength is shared. Where courage is passed.

I protect. I show them what a true man does.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t let anything distract me*.  \nNot the Beast. Not the fear. Not the doubt.  \nBecause I know\u2014*she sees me*.  \nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nI may not be perfect. I may make mistakes.

In the rhythm of the forest. In the way the wind howls through the pines\u2014like a song.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at dusk, I *hear* the stories. Not in words, but in the way the elders speak. In the way the children laugh. In the way the fire crackles\u2014like a heartbeat.  \n\nI\u2019ve never studied art. But I\u2019ve *seen* beauty in the way Belle walks\u2014her grace, her quiet strength. In the way the sun hits the trees at dawn.
