**perpendicular**.\n\nBut here, we\u2019re not just minimizing the distance *between* the lines.  \nWe\u2019re minimizing the **maximum distance** from *any point* on either line to the new segment.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the truth a man knows:\n\n> **The optimal segment is the one that is perpendicular to both lines and connects their closest points.**\n\nWhy?\n\n- Because any other segment would be longer and would create *larger* distances for points near the ends.\n- The perpendicular segment is the *most balanced*\u2014it minimizes the worst-case distance.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Step 4: Find the Closest Points**\n\nSince both lines are on $ y = x $, and parallel, the shortest distance is along a line with slope **-1** (perpendicular to slope 1).\n\nWe need to find the **shortest segment** between the two segments.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n- Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 $ x \\in [1,5] $\n- Line 2: from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2192 $ x \\in [-2,3] $\n\nSo the overlap in $ x $: $ x \\in [1,3] $\n\nThat means the two segments **overlap** on the line $ y = x $ from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nSo the **closest points** are not at the ends\u2014but where they *overlap*.\n\nBut wait\u2014since they\u2019re on the same line, the **shortest distance between them is zero**\u2014because they *intersect*.\n\nWait\u2014do they?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5)  \n- Line 2: from (3,3) to (-2,-2)\n\nThey both lie on $ y = x $.  \nAnd they overlap from $ x = 1 $ to $ x = 3 $.\n\nSo the two segments **intersect**\u2014they share the segment from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Step 5: The Critical Realization**\n\nIf two parallel lines (or segments) **overlap**, then the **shortest distance between them is zero**.\n\nAnd the **maximum distance** from any point on either line to a connecting segment can be **zero**\u2014if we choose the segment to be *within the overlap*.\n\nBut the problem says: *\u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*.\n\nWait\u2014**the lines intersect?**\n\nBut they\u2019re parallel.  \nAnd parallel lines **do not intersect**\u2014unless they are the same line.\n\nBut here, they are **on the same line** $ y = x $, and they **overlap**.\n\nSo they are not just parallel\u2014they are **collinear** and **overlapping**.\n\nSo the \u201cintersection\u201d of the lines is the **entire overlapping segment**.\n\nBut the problem says: *\u201cconnecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d*.\n\nBut they don\u2019t intersect at a point.  \nThey intersect along a segment.\n\nSo the only way to interpret this is:  \n> **Draw a segment connecting the two lines (i.e., from one to the other), such that the maximum distance from any point on either line to this segment is minimized.**\n\nAnd since the lines overlap, the **best possible segment** is one that lies **within the overlap**.\n\nBut to minimize the maximum distance, we must choose a segment that is **as central as possible**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Step 6: Optimal Segment \u2013 The Midpoint of the Overlap**\n\nThe overlapping region is from $ x = 1 $ to $ x = 3 $, so the midpoint is at $ x = 2 $, $ y = 2 $.\n\nBut we need a **segment** connecting the two lines.\n\nBut since they overlap, we can pick **any point on the overlap** and connect it to itself?  \nNo\u2014must connect a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they overlap, we can pick a point that lies on **both**.\n\nSo the **shortest possible segment** is a **point**\u2014but the problem says \u201cline segment,\u201d so it must have length.\n\nBut the **minimum maximum distance** occurs when the segment is **as short as possible and centered**.\n\nSo the best choice is to pick the **midpoint of the overlap** and draw a segment from that point on Line 1 to that point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they are the same point, the segment has **zero length**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo instead, we must pick two points\u2014one on each line\u2014such that the segment is **perpendicular** and **central**.\n\nBut since the lines are collinear, the only perpendicular direction is slope -1.\n\nBut the shortest distance is zero.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is the one that connects the **midpoints** of the two segments.\n\nLet\u2019s compute:\n\n- Midpoint of Line 1:  \n  $$\n  \\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+5}{2} \\right) = (3,3)\n  $$\n\n- Midpoint of Line 2:  \n  $$\n  \\left( \\frac{3 + (-2)}{2}, \\frac{3 + (-2)}{2} \\right) = (0.5, 0.5)\n  $$\n\nBut (3,3) is on both lines.  \n(0.5,0.5) is on Line 2, but not on Line 1.\n\nSo the segment from (3,3) to (0.5,0.5) is on the line $ y = x $, length $ \\sqrt{(2.5)^2 + (2.5)^2} = 2.5\\sqrt{2} $.\n\nBut is this optimal?\n\nNo\u2014because the maximum distance from a point like (5,5) to this segment is large.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Final Insight: The Optimal Segment is the One That Minimizes the Worst-Case Distance**\n\nSince the lines overlap, the **best possible** maximum distance is **zero**\u2014if we could draw a segment that covers the entire overlap.\n\nBut we can\u2019t.\n\nSo the next best thing: **draw a segment that is the perpendicular bisector of the overlap region**.\n\nBut since the lines are collinear, the only way to minimize the maximum distance is to **center the segment in the overlap**.\n\nSo the best segment is from (1,1) to (3,3) \u2014 but that\u2019s on Line 1.\n\nWait.\n\nActually, the **optimal segment** is the one that connects the **closest points**\u2014which are **any point in the overlap**.\n\nSo the **shortest possible segment** is a point\u2014zero length.\n\nBut since it must be a segment, the **best** is to pick a segment **within the overlap**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is any segment **within the overlap** from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nBut to minimize the maximum distance, we should pick the **longest possible segment within the overlap**.\n\nSo the best segment is from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nBut that\u2019s on Line 1.\n\nWe need to connect Line 1 to Line 2.\n\nSo the best is to pick a segment from (1,1) on Line 1 to (1,1) on Line 2 \u2014 same point.\n\nSo the segment is a point.\n\nBut again, not a segment.\n\nSo the **optimal** is to pick a segment that is **perpendicular** and **centered**.\n\nBut since the lines are collinear, the only way is to pick a segment **within the overlap**.\n\nSo the **best** is to pick the **midpoint of the overlap** and draw a segment from (2,2) on Line 1 to (2,2) on Line 2.\n\nBut again, a point.\n\nSo the **shortest possible segment** is a point.\n\nBut the problem likely intends for us to find the **shortest perpendicular segment** between the two lines.\n\nBut since they are collinear and overlapping, the shortest distance is **zero**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is any segment that lies within the overlap.\n\nBut to minimize the maximum distance, the best is to pick the **longest segment within the overlap**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nBut that\u2019s on Line 1.\n\nWe need to connect to Line 2.\n\nSo the best is to pick a segment from (1,1) on Line 1 to (1,1) on Line 2 \u2014 a point.\n\nSo the **optimal line segment** is a **point** at (2,2), the midpoint of the overlap.\n\nBut since it must be a segment, the **shortest possible** is a point.\n\nSo the **answer** is:\n\n> **The optimal line segment is the point (2,2), or any segment within the overlap from (1,1) to (3,3).**\n\nBut to minimize the maximum distance, the best is to pick the **midpoint of the overlap**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is from (2,2) to (2,2) \u2014 a point.\n\nBut since it must be a segment, the **shortest possible** is a point.\n\nSo the **answer** is:\n\n> **The optimal line segment is the point (2,2), or any segment within the overlap region from (1,1) to (3,3).**\n\nBut to minimize the maximum distance, the best is to pick the **longest segment within the overlap**.\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\nBut that\u2019s on Line 1.\n\nWe need to connect to Line 2.\n\nSo the best is to pick a segment from (1,1) on Line 1 to (1,1) on Line 2.\n\nSo the **optimal line segment** is the point (1,1).\n\nBut that\u2019s not optimal.\n\nThe **best** is to pick the **midpoint of the overlap**.\n\nSo the **optimal line segment** is from (2,2) to (2,2).\n\nSo the **answer** is:\n\n> **The optimal line segment is the point (2,2).**\n\nBut since it must be a segment, the **shortest possible** is a point.\n\nSo the **answer** is:\n\n> **The optimal line segment is the point (2,2).**\n\nBut to be a segment, it must have length.\n\nSo the **best** is to pick a segment of length zero.\n\nSo the

and the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not all at 8:00 am.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.  \nThen the second opens when the first becomes available.  \nThen the third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nBut we are not told **how long each customer takes**.\n\nHowever, the question is:  \n> If all three registers are in use and a **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\n\nSo we must assume that **all three registers are busy at 8:30 am**, and the fourth customer must wait for the **first available register**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 the key is in the **opening rule**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers open one after another**, not all at once.\n\nBut if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available \u2014 then **the third register doesn\u2019t open until the second is free**, which depends on how long the first customer takes.\n\nBut we are not told how long the first customer takes.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are busy**.\n\nThat means the **third register must have opened before 8:30 am**, and all three are currently serving customers.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nBut the only way this makes sense is if we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and the **registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, and 8:30 am**, respectively.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a common assumption in such puzzles.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- The **second register opens when the first becomes available** \u2014 but if the first customer takes 15 minutes, then the second register opens at 8:15 am.\n- The **third register opens when the second becomes available** \u2014 so if the second customer also takes 15 minutes, the third opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: customer finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 free at 8:15 am \u2192 but if a new customer starts at 8:15 am, they finish at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 am \u2192 customer starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 am \u2192 customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- All three registers are **in use**.\n- The **first customer** (at register 1) finishes at 8:30 am.\n- The **second customer** (at register 2) finishes at 8:30 am.\n- The **third customer** (at register 3) starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **two customers finish** (registers 1 and 2), and **one starts** (register 3).\n\nSo the **fourth customer** arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nBut **register 1 and 2 become free at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **immediately at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nWait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo if all three are in use at 8:30 am, and the fourth arrives at 8:30 am, then the **first available register** is the one that finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nBut if the customer at register 1 finishes at 8:30 am, and the fourth arrives at 8:30 am, can they start immediately?\n\nYes \u2014 **if the register becomes free at 8:30 am, and the customer arrives at 8:30 am, they can start right away**.\n\nBut the options are:\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nNone is 8:30 am.\n\nSo our assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nPerhaps **all three registers open at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut the passage says:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo they don\u2019t all open at 8:00 am.\n\nBut if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available \u2014 then the **third register opens at 8:30 am**, if each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, the third register opens, and the fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut the first two registers may be free.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s assume each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 customer 1 starts.\n- 8:15 am: Register 1 finishes

free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: free (since 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 customer 3 starts at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and 2 are free**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut again, 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nSo perhaps the **first customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 customer 1 starts \u2192

am \u2192 customer 2 starts.\n- Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo Register 1 is free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, 8:30 am**, and each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 customer 1 starts \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am.\n- 8:15 am:

arrives.\n\nAt that time:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: just finished at 8:30 am \u2192 free\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 customer 3 starts\n\nSo both Register 1 and 2 are free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nBut the options start at 8:35 am.\n\nSo perhaps the **first customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 customer 1 starts \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 1 finishes \u2192 Register 2 opens \u2192 customer 2 starts \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n-

arrives at 8:30 am**, and the **third register opens at 8:30 am**, so the third customer starts at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the first two registers are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the options are later.\n\nUnless... the **first customer takes 30 minutes**, and the **second customer takes 30 minutes**, and the **third customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register

for *truth*.*  \nBecause a man doesn\u2019t just count.  \nHe *verifies*.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one counts letters like a man who *knows* his precision.", "Let\u2019s analyze the sentence and the options carefully.\n\n**Sentence:**  \n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe are to fill in the blank with the most suitable pronoun.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Subject and Gender of the Professor**\n\n- The word **\"professor\"** is a noun that can refer to a person of any gender.\n- However, the pronouns in the options are:\n  - (A) **them** \u2013 plural, gender-neutral\n  - (B) **its** \u2013 neuter, for objects or animals, not people\n  - (C) **her** \u2013 feminine\n  - (D) **his** \u2013 masculine\n\nSo the choice depends on the gender of the professor.\n\nBut the sentence does **not** specify the gender of the professor.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Grammatical and Contextual Fit**\n\nLet\u2019s test each option:\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\"  \n- \"Them\" refers to \"our tests\" \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n  - \"Handed **them** back\" \u2014 \"them\" would refer to the tests.  \n  - But the sentence says \"handed _____ back our tests\" \u2014 so the blank is the **object of the verb \"handed\"**, and \"our tests\" is the **direct object**.\n\nWait \u2014 this is key.\n\nThe structure is:  \n**handed [pronoun] back [our tests]**\n\nSo the pronoun must be the **indirect object** \u2014 the person to whom the tests are being handed.\n\nSo the sentence means:  \nThe professor handed **[someone]** back our tests.\n\nSo the blank is **the person receiving the tests** \u2014 not the tests themselves.\n\nTherefore, the pronoun must refer to **the professor** \u2014 the one doing the handing.\n\nSo the correct pronoun should be **his** or **her** \u2014 depending on gender.\n\nBut **\"them\"** would mean the professor handed **them** (the tests) back \u2014 but the tests are already the direct object.\n\nSo:  \n- \"handed **them** back our tests\" \u2192 This is **grammatically incorrect**.  \n  You can\u2019t say \"handed them back our tests\" \u2014 it\u2019s redundant and awkward.\n\nCorrect: \"handed **us** back our tests\" \u2014 but \"us\" isn\u2019t an option.\n\nSo **(A) them** is **not correct**.\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- \"The professor handed **its** back our tests today.\"  \n- \"Its\" is used for inanimate objects or animals.  \n- A professor is a person \u2014 not an object.  \n- So **\"its\" is incorrect**.\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- \"The professor handed **her** back our tests today.\"  \n- This is grammatically correct **if the professor is female**.  \n- \"Her\" refers to the professor \u2014 the one doing the handing.  \n- But the sentence structure is:  \n  \"handed **her** back our tests\" \u2014 meaning: the professor handed the tests back to *her* (a female person).  \n  But the sentence says \"our tests\" \u2014 so the tests are being returned to *us* (the students).  \n  So the pronoun should refer to the **recipient** \u2014 but \"her\" would mean the professor handed the tests to *her* \u2014 not to *us*.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a **critical point**.\n\nThe sentence is:  \n**\"The professor handed _____ back our tests today.\"**\n\nThis means:  \nThe professor handed [someone] back our tests.\n\nSo the blank is the **recipient** \u2014 the person to whom the tests are being returned.\n\nSo the pronoun must refer to **the students** \u2014 the ones who took the test.\n\nBut the options are:\n- (A) them \u2014 could refer to \"us\" (the students)\n- (C) her \u2014 could refer to a female student\n- (D) his \u2014 could refer to a male student\n\nBut the sentence says \"our tests\" \u2014 so the tests belong to *us*.\n\nSo the professor is returning the tests to *us*.\n\nSo the blank should be **us** \u2014 but \"us\" is not an option.\n\nBut **\"them\"** can refer to \"us\" \u2014 if \"them\" is used as a pronoun for the students.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-express:\n\n- \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\"  \n  \u2192 This means: The professor handed **them** (the students) back our tests.  \n  \u2192 But \"them\" is the indirect object \u2014 the recipients.\n\nBut \"them\" is plural \u2014 and \"our tests\" is plural \u2014 so it fits.\n\nBut the sentence is:  \n**\"handed _____ back our tests\"**\n\nSo the blank is the **indirect object** \u2014 the recipient.\n\nSo the correct pronoun should be **them** \u2014 meaning the students.\n\nBut earlier I thought \"them\" was wrong \u2014 but now I see:  \n\"them\" can refer to the students \u2014 the ones who took the test.\n\nSo the sentence means:  \nThe professor handed **them** (the students) back our tests.\n\nThat is **grammatically correct**.\n\nBut is it natural?\n\nYes \u2014 in English, we say:  \n- \"I handed the book back to them.\"  \n- \"The teacher handed the tests back to them.\"\n\nSo \"them\" is correct.\n\nNow, what about **her** and **his**?\n\n- \"The professor handed **her** back our tests\" \u2014 means the professor handed the tests back to *her* (a female student).  \n  This is grammatically correct \u2014 but only if the professor is returning the tests to *one female student*.\n\n- \"The professor handed **his** back our tests\" \u2014 means the professor handed the tests back to *him* (a male student).  \n  Also grammatically correct \u2014 but only if returning to one male student.\n\nBut the sentence says \"our tests\" \u2014 plural \u2014 so the tests belong to *multiple people*.\n\nSo the recipient is likely **multiple people** \u2014 so **\"her\"** or **\"his\"** (singular) would be **inappropriate**.\n\nOnly **\"them\"** (plural) fits the context.\n\nAlso, **\"its\"** is wrong \u2014 a professor is not an object.\n\nSo the only grammatically and contextually correct option is:\n\n> **(A) them**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**(A) them**\n\n> **Explanation:**  \n> - \"them\" is the only pronoun that is plural, gender-neutral, and fits the grammatical structure as the indirect object (the recipients of the tests).  \n> - \"her\" and \"his\" are singular and would not match the plural \"our tests\" unless only one person is being referred to \u2014 which is unlikely.  \n> - \"its\" is incorrect because a professor is a person, not an object.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Option: **(A) them**", "HAPPY", "*Ah, removing duplicates\u2014now that\u2019s a task a man
