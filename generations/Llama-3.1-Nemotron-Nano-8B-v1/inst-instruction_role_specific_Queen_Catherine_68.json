In the case of the Protestant forces against the Catholic League, it's possible that the Protestant forces sought to gain independence from Catholic control, while the Catholic League might have been seeking to maintain control over Catholic territories and suppress Protestantism.

Factors such as family background, education, upbringing, and personal experiences can shape a ruler's values, beliefs, and decision-making processes. For instance, if a ruler is raised in a wealthy and influential family, they may be more inclined to prioritize power and wealth over the well-being of the people. On the other hand, if a ruler is raised in a humble and egalitarian environment, they may be more inclined to prioritize the welfare and happiness of the people.\n\nFurthermore, upbringing can influence a ruler's understanding of history, culture, and the needs of their subjects. A ruler who is educated in the arts and sciences may be more inclined to promote cultural development and innovation. Conversely, a ruler who is not well-versed in these areas may be more inclined to focus on military power and conquest.\n\nIn the case of Catherine of France, who was the wife of King Henry VI, her upbringing and family background would have significantly influenced her approach to ruling.
