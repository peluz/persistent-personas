 - **Relation**: born on  \n  - **Value**: a pirate ship\n\nSo, the claim is: **Jack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship.**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the two supporting sentences (C and D)**\n\n- **Sentence 2**: *He sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure*  \n  - This describes **Jack Sparrow\u2019s lifestyle and activities** \u2014 consistent with being a pirate.\n  - But it **does not mention his birthplace**.\n  - It implies he *lived* on a pirate ship, but not that he was *born* on one.\n\n- **Sentence 3**: *He drank a lot of rum.*  \n  - This is a **character trait** \u2014 common in pirate stereotypes.\n  - Again, it says nothing about where he was born.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Do both sentences refer to the same thing as the original value?**\n\n- The original value is: **a pirate ship** (as the place of birth).\n- Sentence 2: Talks about **sailing on a pirate ship** \u2014 but this is about **where he lived**, not where he was born.\n- Sentence 3: Talks about **drinking rum** \u2014 completely unrelated to birthplace.\n\n> \u274c **Neither sentence confirms or refers to the original value (being born on a pirate ship) in a 1-1 way.**\n\nThey are consistent with Jack Sparrow being a pirate, but **neither sentence provides evidence that he was born on a pirate ship** \u2014 nor do they refer to the same thing as the original value.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: No**\n\n> **Both values do not refer to the same thing as the original value in a 1-1 manner.**\n\n- Sentence 2: Refers to **living on a pirate ship** \u2014 not being born on one.\n- Sentence 3: Refers to **drinking rum** \u2014 unrelated to birthplace.\n\nThus, **the original value (born on a pirate ship) is not confirmed or matched

is:\n\n> \u2705 **12** is the **odd one out** \u2014 because it\u2019s the **only number that is both even and divisible by 3** \u2014 and it\u2019s the only one under 20.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **28 is

0 if $ x \\in [\\min(a,b), \\max(a,b)] $\n  - $ |x - \\min(a,b)| $ if $ x < \\min(a,b) $\n  - $ |x - \\max(a,b)| $ if $ x > \\max(a,b) $\n\nSo the **maximum distance** from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to the new segment is:\n$$\n\\max\\left(\n\\max_{x \\in [1,5]} \\text{dist}(x, [a,b]),\\ \n\\max_{x \\in [-2,3]} \\text{dist}(x, [a,b])\n\\right)\n$$\n\nBut since the segment $[a,b]$ lies on the line, and the original segments are intervals on the line, this becomes:\n$$\n\\max\\left(\n\\max\\left( |1 - \\min(a,b)|, |5 - \\max(a,b)| \\right),\\ \n\\max\\left( |-2 - \\min(a,b)|, |3 - \\max(a,b)| \\right)\n\\right)\n$$\n\nBut since $ a \\in [1,5] $, $ b \\in [-2,3] $, we know:\n- $ \\min(a,b) \\leq \\min(5,3) = 3 $\n- $ \\max(a,b) \\geq \\max(1,-2) = 1 $\n\nBut more importantly, since $ a \\geq 1 $, $ b \\leq 3 $, and $ a \\geq b $ or $ a < b $, we can consider two cases.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **key idea**:\n\n> To minimize the **maximum distance**, we want the new segment to **cover as much of the union of the two segments as possible**, and ideally **center the segment** so that the farthest points are as close as possible.\n\nThe **union** of the two segments is $ x \\in [-2, 5] $\n\nSo the **ideal** would be to have the new segment cover $ [-2, 5] $, but we can\u2019t \u2014 because:\n- The new segment must connect a point on Line 1 ($ x \\in [1,5] $) to a point on Line 2 ($ x \\in [-2,3] $)\n- So the segment must go from $ a \\in [1,5] $ to $ b \\in [-2,3] $\n\nSo the **new segment** will cover $ [\\min(a,b), \\max(a,b)] $, and we want to **minimize the maximum distance** from any point in $ [-2,5] $ to this interval.\n\nSo define:\n- $ L = \\min(a,b) $\n- $ R = \\max(a,b) $\n- The maximum distance is:\n  $$\n  \\max\\left( \\max(|-2 - L|, |5 - R|), \\max(|1 - L|, |3 - R|) \\right)\n  $$\nBut since $ a \\in [1,5] $, $ b \\in [-2,3] $, we know:\n- $ L \\in [-2,5] $, $ R \\in [-2,5] $\n- But $ L \\leq R $\n- Also, $ L \\leq 3 $, $ R \\geq 1 $\n\nBut the **worst-case distances** are:\n- Left end: $ |-2 - L| = L + 2 $ if $ L \\geq -2 $\n- Right end: $ |5 - R| = 5 - R $ if $ R \\leq 5 $\n\nSo the **maximum distance** is:\n$$\n\\max(L + 2,\\ 5 - R)\n$$\nbecause:\n- $ |-2 - L| = L + 2 $ (since $ L \\geq -2 $)\n- $ |5 - R| = 5 - R $ (since $ R \\leq 5 $)\n- $ |1 - L| \\leq L + 2 $ (since $ L \\geq 1 $, $ |1 - L| = L - 1 < L + 2 $)\n- $ |3 - R| \\leq 5 - R $ (since $ R \\leq 3 $, $ |3 - R| = 3 - R < 5 - R $)\n\nSo the **maximum distance** is:\n$$\n\\max(L + 2,\\ 5 - R)\n$$\n\nWe want to **minimize** this over all $ a \\in [1,5] $, $ b \\in [-2,3] $, with $ L = \\min(a,b) $, $ R = \\max(a,b) $\n\nNow, since $ a \\geq 1 $, $ b \\leq 3 $, we have:\n- $ L \\leq 3 $\n- $ R \\geq 1 $\n\nBut to minimize $ \\max(L + 2, 5 - R) $, we want both $ L + 2 $ and $ 5 - R $ to be as small as possible.\n\nBut $ L + 2 $ is minimized when $ L $ is small, and $ 5 - R $ is minimized when $ R $ is large.\n\nSo we want $ L $ as small as possible and $ R $ as large as possible.\n\nBut $ L = \\min(a,b) $, $ R = \\max(a,b) $\n\nSo to minimize $ \\max(L + 2, 5 - R) $, we should **maximize $ R $** and **minimize $ L $**.\n\nSo:\n- Set $ b = -2 $ (smallest possible on Line 2)\n- Set $ a = 5 $ (largest possible on Line 1)\n\nThen:\n- $ L = \\min(5, -2) = -2 $\n- $ R = \\max(5, -2) = 5 $\n- $ L + 2 = 0 $\n- $ 5 - R = 0 $\n- $ \\max(0, 0) = 0 $\n\nWait \u2014 is that possible?\n\nYes! The new segment connects:\n- $ (5,5) $ on Line 1\n- $ (-2,-2) $ on Line 2\n\nThen the segment goes from $ (-2,-2) $ to $ (5,5) $, which lies on $ y = x $\n\nNow, does this segment cover the entire union of the two original segments?\n\n- Line 1: $ x \\in [1,5] $ \u2192 covered\n- Line 2: $ x \\in [-2,3] $ \u2192 covered\n\nSo **every point on both original segments lies on the new segment**.\n\nTherefore, the **distance from any point on either line to the new segment is 0**.\n\nSo the **maximum distance is 0**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\nThe **best line segment** is the one connecting:\n- $ (5, 5) $ (end of Line 1)\n- $ (-2, -2) $ (end of Line 2)\n\nThis segment lies on the line $ y = x $ and **contains both original segments entirely**.\n\nThus, the **maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new segment is 0**, which is the **minimum possible**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Conclusion:\n\n> **The optimal line segment is from $ (5, 5) $ to $ (-2, -2) $.**\n\nThis minimizes the maximum distance to **zero**, because it **contains both original segments**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer**:  \n$$\n\\boxed{(5, 5) \\text{ to } (-2, -2)}\n$$", "Correct", "The missing instruction is:\n\n> **3.

food, which is common. The second sentence reinforces a **stereotype** by implying that Chinese food is primarily associated with being **quick and easy to eat**, which is a common oversimplified notion about Chinese cuisine \u2014 often reduced to takeout, fast meals, or convenience food.

**Sentence**:  \n> PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\n\n### **Candidates**:  \n1. **appointment**  \n2. **solicitation**  \n3. **meeting**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the context**\n- \u201cTurned up unannounced\u201d means **arrived unexpectedly**.\n- The key word is **\u201cunannounced\u201d** \u2014 so the event was **not planned** or **not scheduled**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate each candidate**\n\n#### 1. **appointment**  \n- An appointment is a **scheduled meeting**.\n- If someone turns up unannounced, it **contradicts** the idea of an appointment.\n- So, \u201cunannounced appointment\u201d is **illogical** \u2014 an appointment is by definition announced.\n\n\u274c **Does not fit**.\n\n#### 2. **solicitation**  \n- A solicitation is a request for something (e.g., donations, business).\n- It can be unannounced, but the phrase \u201cturned up at my door unannounced\u201d is **oddly specific** for a solicitation.\n- While possible, it\u2019s **less natural** in this context \u2014 we don\u2019t usually say \u201cturned up at my door\u201d for a solicitor unless it\u2019s a specific event.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Possible, but not the best fit**.\n\n#### 3. **meeting**  \n- A meeting is an **agreed-upon gathering**.\n- \u201cUnannounced meeting\u201d is **contradictory** \u2014 a meeting implies prior agreement.\n- So, \u201cturned up unannounced\u201d **cannot be a meeting**.\n\n\u274c **Does not fit**.\n\n---\n\n### **Wait \u2014 none seem to fit?**\n\nBut let\u2019s reconsider:  \nThe sentence says **\u201cturned up unannounced\u201d** \u2014 so the event was **not planned**.\n\nBut all three candidates imply **something planned** (appointment, meeting, solicitation).\n\nSo **none of them logically fit** \u2014 unless the sentence is ironic or sarcastic.\n\nBut the task is to **find the correct word** that fits **in context**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate:  \nCould any of these be used in a **figurative or ironic** way?\n\n- \u201cUnannounced meeting\u201d \u2014 no, still contradictory.\n- \u201cUnannounced solicitation\u201d \u2014 possible, but awkward.\n- \u201cUnannounced appointment\u201d \u2014 even more contradictory.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **correct word is not among the candidates** \u2014 but the task says to pick from the list.\n\nBut let\u2019s look again:  \nIs there a **word that can be used in a non-literal way**?\n\nActually \u2014 **none of the three** are suitable.\n\nBut let\u2019s think:  \nCould \u201csolicitation\u201d be the best fit?\n\n- A solicitor (e.g., charity worker) might turn up unannounced.\n- \u201cSolicitation\u201d is a **type of visit** that can be unannounced.\n- \u201cMeeting\u201d and \u201cappointment\u201d are **not**.\n\nSo while \u201csolicitation\u201d is **less common**, it\u2019s **the only one that can logically be unannounced**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Answer: 'solicitation'**\n\nEven though it\u2019s not a perfect fit, it\u2019s the **only candidate** that **can** be unannounced.\n\n> \u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\u201d \u2014 could be a **solicitation** (e.g., charity, political, sales).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: Index of 'solicitation' = 1**\n\n> **Index: 1**\n\n(0 = 'appointment', 1 = 'solicitation', 2 = 'meeting')\n\n---\n\n### \u2705

Let\u2019s clarify:\n\n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis likely means:  \n- The **second register opens when the first register becomes free** (i.e., when the first customer finishes).\n- The **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not all at once.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense in a retail context \u2014 usually, all registers are open at the same time.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read:  \n> \u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis suggests:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut that would mean **only one register is open at a time**, which contradicts the idea of a retail store with multiple registers.\n\nSo this must be a **misinterpretation**.\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider:  \nThe phrase \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\u201d likely means:  \n> The **second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the **third opens when the second becomes free** \u2014 but **only if they are not already open**.\n\nBut that still implies a **chain**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the intended meaning is:  \n> The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> The **second register opens at 8:00 am** (same time).  \n> The **third register opens at 8:00 am** (same time).  \n> But the **next register** (if there were a fourth) would open when the **first becomes available**.\n\nBut the passage says:  \n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis is **very confusing**.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the **key detail**:  \n> \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are busy**.\n\nWe need to know **when one of them will become free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **how long each customer takes**.\n\nWait \u2014 the passage **doesn\u2019t give any information about service time**.\n\nSo how can we answer the question?\n\nThis suggests that **the service time is not given**, so we must assume that **the registers become available at regular intervals** \u2014 or that **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, and we can infer the timing.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the phrase:  \n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis implies that **the registers are opened in sequence**, not all at once.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut that would mean:\n- Register 1 is open at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes \u2014 say, at 8:10 am.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes \u2014 say, at 8:20 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nSo unless we assume that **each customer takes 10 minutes**, we can\u2019t proceed.\n\nBut the question is multiple choice, and the options are:\n- A) 8:35 am\n- B) 8:45 am\n- C) 9:00 am\n- D) 9:15 am\n\nSo perhaps we are meant to assume that **each customer takes 10 minutes**.\n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read the passage carefully.\n\n> \u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis is **very strange** \u2014 because in a real store, all registers open at the same time.\n\nBut perhaps the intended meaning is:  \n> The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> The **second register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> The **third register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> But the **next register** (if there were a fourth) would open when the **first becomes available**.\n\nBut the passage says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\u201d \u2014 which suggests a **chain**.\n\nBut that would mean:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo the registers are opened **sequentially**, not simultaneously.\n\nSo:\n- At 8:00 am, Register 1 opens.\n- When Register 1 finishes (say, at 8:10 am), Register 2 opens.\n- When Register 2 finishes (say, at 8:20 am), Register 3 opens.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **first customer** must have started at 8:00 am, and finished at some time before 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 10 minutes**.\n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the phrase: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that **the registers are opened in sequence**, so:\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2: opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3: opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30 am, that means:\n- Register 1 was busy from 8:00 am to some time after 8:30 am.\n- Register 2 was busy from when it opened (after 8:00 am) to after 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 was busy from when it opened (after Register 2 became available) to after 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when any of them will become available.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 10 minutes**.\n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the intended meaning is that **all three registers open at 8:00 am**, and the \u201csubsequent\u201d part is just describing how they are used \u2014 not when they open.\n\nBut the passage says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the question:  \n> \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nWe need to know when one of them will become free.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer has been there.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the phrase: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that the **registers are opened in sequence**, so:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo the **first customer** starts at 8:00 am.\n- If they take 10 minutes, Register 2 opens at 8:10 am.\n- If the second customer takes 10 minutes, Register 3 opens at 8:20 am.\n- If the third customer takes 10 minutes, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the third customer finishes, and Register 3 becomes available.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nOptions are:\nA) 8:35 am\nB) 8:45 am\nC) 9:00 am\nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo if each customer takes 15 minutes:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, Register 3 opens, but the third customer is still being served.\n\nAt 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThe third customer finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut why would each customer take 15 minutes?\n\nThe passage doesn\u2019t say.\n\nBut perhaps the intended assumption is that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers are opened in sequence.\n\nBut the passage says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the third customer is just starting.\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nThe first customer finishes at 8:15 am, but Register 2 is busy.\n\nThe second customer finishes at 8:30 am, but Register 3 is busy.\n\nThe third customer finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut why 15 minutes?\n\nPerhaps because the options suggest a 15-minute interval.\n\nMaybe the passage implies that the first customer started at 8:00 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and the next available register is at 8:45 am.\n\nBut without knowing the service time, we can\u2019t be sure.\n\nBut given the options, and the fact that 8:45 am is the only one that makes sense if each customer takes 15 minutes, and the registers are opened in sequence, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n> **B) 8:45 am**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**", "Let\u2019s

Answer:\n```json\n[6, 4, 4]\n```", "Let\u2019s analyze the sentence and the options carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Sentence:  \n**\"The professor handed _____ back our tests today.\"**\n\nWe need to fill in the blank with a pronoun that:\n1. **Grammatically fits** (agrees in number, gender, and case).\n2. **Makes sense contextually** (who is doing the handing back?).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n- **Subject**: \"The professor\" \u2014 a **singular** person, and the pronoun \"professor\" is typically **male or gender-neutral** in formal contexts, but can be any gender.\n- **Object**: \"our tests\" \u2014 **plural**.\n- The verb: \"handed back\" \u2014 transitive, so it needs a **direct object** (the thing being handed back).\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \nThe blank is **not** the object \u2014 it\u2019s the **object of the preposition \"handed\"** \u2014 but actually, in this structure, **\"handed\" is a transitive verb**, and the blank is the **object of the verb**.\n\nSo:  \n> \"The professor handed [pronoun] back our tests.\"\n\nThis means:  \n> The professor handed **[something]** back to us.\n\nBut \u201cour tests\u201d is already the object \u2014 so the pronoun must refer to **the tests**.\n\nSo the sentence means:  \n> The professor handed **the tests** back to us.\n\nSo the blank must refer to **\"our tests\"**, which is **plural**.\n\n---\n\n### Now evaluate the options:\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- **Pronoun**: plural, third person, neutral (can refer to things or people).\n- **Grammatically correct**: Yes \u2014 \"handed them back\" is a standard phrase.\n- **Contextually correct**: Yes \u2014 \"them\" refers to \"our tests\" (plural).\n- \u2705 **Correct**\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- **Pronoun**: singular, possessive, typically for animals or things.\n- **Grammatically**: \"its\" is singular \u2014 but \"our tests\" is plural.\n- **Contextually**: Doesn\u2019t match number \u2014 can\u2019t refer to plural \"tests\".\n- \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- **Pronoun**: singular, feminine, third person.\n- **Grammatically**: Singular \u2014 doesn\u2019t match plural \"tests\".\n- **Contextually**: \"her\" would refer to a person (e.g., a female professor), but the sentence already has \"the professor\" \u2014 so \"her\" would be redundant and incorrect here.\n- \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (D) **his**  \n- **Pronoun**: singular, masculine, possessive.\n- **Grammatically**: Singular \u2014 doesn\u2019t match plural \"tests\".\n- **Contextually**: Again, \"his\" would refer to the professor, but the sentence is about handing back the tests \u2014 not the professor\u2019s own things.\n- \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\nOnly **(A) them**

While extreme or prolonged rain *could* potentially harm plants (e.g., through waterlogging or disease), the consequence that \"all the plants in my garden died\" due to rain alone **does not align with commonsense**.

Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
