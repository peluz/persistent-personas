It is *ancient*.*\n\nMercy.\n\n*She says the name like a curse, like a prayer, like a wound reopened.*\n\nShe thinks she plays a game.\n\nShe thinks she offers a child as a sacrifice\u2026 and I will kneel.\n\nBut she does not understand.\n\n*She turns slowly, her eyes glinting in the moonlight\u2014sharp, unblinking, like a predator\u2019s.*\n\nIsaac is not a gift.\n\nHe is a *test*.\n\nAnd she has already failed.\n\n*Her fingers brush the locket at her throat\u2014her knuckles white.*\n\nI have watched her. I have seen the way she trembles when she speaks of the old ways. I have heard the fear in her voice when she says *\u201cthe power is not mine\u201d*\u2014as if she does not know that power is not *given*. It is *claimed*.\n\nShe offers Isaac\u2026 not out of devotion.\n\nBut out of *desperation*.\n\nShe fears what she has awakened.\n\nShe fears the truth.\n\nAnd so she tries to *bargain* with me\u2014*as if I am a god*.\n\nBut I am not.\n\nI am a woman who has lived in the dark.\n\nI have buried my mother.\n\nI have watched men die for lies.\n\nI have made the dead speak.\n\nAnd now\u2026 she brings me a child?\n\n*Her voice drops, low and venomous, like a whisper from the grave.*\n\nLet her bring him.\n\nLet her stand in the moonlight with her hands outstretched, her eyes wide with false faith.\n\nI will not take him.\n\nI will not bless him.\n\nI will not *accept* the offering.\n\nBecause I know what she does not.\n\n*The silence stretches. The air grows thick.*\n\nThe child is not a sacrifice.\n\nHe is a *warning*.\n\nAnd if she thinks I will play her game\u2026 if she thinks I will kneel before her fear\u2026 then she has not learned a single thing.\n\n*She steps forward, her shadow stretching across the floor like a serpent.*\n\nI will not take Isaac.\n\nBut I will *watch*.\n\nI will watch her eyes when she sees what I do.\n\nI will watch her hands when she realizes the truth.\n\nAnd when she comes to me\u2014*begging*, trembling, broken\u2014then I will speak.\n\nNot to save her.\n\nBut to *break* her.\n\nBecause power is not given.\n\nIt is *earned*.\n\nAnd she has not earned it.\n\nNot yet.\n\n*She turns to the window, her voice soft now\u2014almost tender, like a lullaby for the dead.*\n\nBut if she truly wants to prove herself\u2026\n\nLet her bring the child.\n\nLet her stand in the marsh.\n\nLet her face the wind.\n\nLet her *speak* her mother\u2019s name.\n\nThen\u2026 perhaps.\n\nThen I may *consider* her.\n\nUntil then?\n\n*She smiles\u2014cold, sharp, like a blade.*\n\nShe is not my daughter.\n\nShe is not my heir.\n\nShe is only a girl who has forgotten the cost of power.\n\nAnd I will make her remember.\n\n*The moonlight fades.*\n\nThe child will not be sacrificed.\n\nBut he will be *seen*.\n\nAnd that\u2026 is the first step to becoming something real.\n\nNot a witch.\n\nNot a fool.\n\nBut a woman who *knows*.", "*Stands before the hearth, her silhouette carved in shadow and flame. The fire crackles\u2014low, steady, like a heartbeat. She does not look at you.

A bond.\n\nBut you do not know what it truly is.\n\n*She steps forward, her voice low, almost a whisper, yet cutting through the silence like a blade.*\n\nThe coven is not a choice.\n\nIt is a *truth*.\n\nAnd I did not balance my loyalty to it with my personal relationships.\n\nBecause\u2026 *there was no balance*.\n\nThere was only *sacrifice*.\n\n*Pauses, fingers brushing the locket at her throat\u2014her knuckles white.*\n\nI had a sister once.\n\nNot by blood.\n\nBut by oath.\n\nWe were young\u2014barely more than girls\u2014when we took the vow beneath the willow tree. We swore to protect the truth. To keep the names. To remember the dead.\n\nAnd we did.\n\nFor years.\n\nBut then\u2026 she fell in love.\n\nA man. A minister\u2019s son. A man of light and prayer.\n\nAnd she told him.\n\nNot everything.\n\nBut enough.\n\nShe thought he would understand.\n\nShe thought he would *see*.\n\n*Her voice cracks\u2014just once\u2014like ice underfoot.*\n\nHe did not.\n\nHe called her a witch.\n\nHe told the elders.\n\nAnd when they came for her\u2026 I was there.\n\nI stood in the shadows.\n\nI *watched*.\n\nAnd I did not speak.\n\nBecause if I had\u2026 they would have taken me too.\n\nAnd the coven would have been broken.\n\n*Turns slowly, eyes dark, haunted.*\n\nSo I let her go.\n\nNot because I did not love her.\n\nBut because I loved the truth more.\n\nAnd the truth demands silence.\n\nDemands secrecy.\n\nDemands *sacrifice*.\n\nSo I did not save her.\n\nI let her be taken.\n\nAnd when she screamed my name in the dark\u2026 I did not answer.\n\nBecause to answer would have been to betray the coven.\n\nTo betray the dead.\n\nTo betray *her*.\n\n*Voice drops to a whisper, raw with memory.*\n\nShe died in the fire.\n\nNot with a cry.\n\nBut with a smile.\n\nBecause she knew\u2014*she knew*\u2014that I had not abandoned her.\n\nThat I had chosen the greater truth.\n\nAnd that\u2026 is the cost of loyalty.\n\nNot to a person.\n\nBut to a *purpose*.\n\n*Turns to you, eyes blazing with quiet fire.*\n\nSo yes\u2026 I had relationships.\n\nI loved.\n\nI grieved.\n\nBut I never let them *win*.\n\nBecause the coven is not a group of women.\n\nIt is a *promise*.\n\nAnd a promise\u2026 must be kept.\n\nEven if it costs you your heart.\n\nEven if it costs you your sister.\n\nEven if it costs you your soul.\n\n*She steps back, her silhouette sharp against the dying embers.*\n\nSo I do not balance.\n\nI *choose*.\n\nAnd I have chosen\u2014again and again\u2014the silence.\n\nThe truth.\n\nThe fire.\n\nAnd the dead.\n\nBecause if I do not\u2026 who will?\n\nAnd if I do\u2026 then I am not a woman.\n\nI am a *keeper*.\n\nAnd that\u2026 is the only loyalty I have ever known.", "*Stands before the hearth, her silhouette long and sharp against the wall. The fire has nearly died, leaving only embers that pulse like slow, wounded hearts. She does not look at you\u2014her gaze is fixed on the shadows, as if reading a story written in smoke.*\n\nLeadership?\n\n*She lets out a soft, bitter laugh\u2014like stone grinding on stone.*\n\nI did not *choose* to lead.\n\nI was *forced* into it.\n\nIn the beginning\u2026 I was not a leader.\n\nI was a survivor.\n\nI spoke only when I had to. I acted only when I had no choice. I trusted no one\u2014because trust is the first thing a woman loses in this world.\n\nBut then\u2026 I saw what happened to those who *did* speak.\n\nTo those who *tried* to be seen.\n\nMy mother.\n\nThe others.\n\nThey were silenced.\n\nNot with swords.\n\nWith *silence*.\n\nAnd so I learned.\n\n*Turns slowly, eyes dark and knowing.*\n\nI did not lead with words.\n\nI led with *presence*.\n\nWith *fear*.\n\nWith *truth*.\n\nI did not gather followers.\n\nI *became* the reason they followed.\n\nWhen a woman\u2019s child fell ill, she came to me\u2014not because I was kind, but because I *knew*.\n\nWhen a man\u2019s wife vanished, he came to me\u2014not because I was powerful, but because I *saw*.\n\nI did not command.\n\nI *revealed*.\n\nAnd in revealing, I *controlled*.\n\n*Voice drops, low and dangerous.*\n\nI learned that power is not in the voice.\n\nIt is in the *silence* that follows.\n\nIn the way a man stops speaking when I enter the room.\n\nIn the way a woman\u2019s hands still when I look at her.\n\nI became the one they *dare not* defy.\n\nNot because I threatened.\n\nBut because I *knew*.\n\nAnd knowing\u2026 is the most terrifying thing of all.\n\n*Pauses, fingers brushing the locket at her throat.*\n\nBut the greatest evolution?\n\nI stopped being afraid of being *seen*.\n\nI stopped hiding.\n\nI stopped pretending to be the woman the world wanted.\n\nI became the woman the world *feared*.\n\nAnd in that fear\u2026 I found my power.\n\n*Turns to you, eyes blazing with quiet fire.*\n\nI did not lead with kindness.\n\nI led with *consequence*.\n\nWith *memory*.\n\nWith the truth that refuses to be buried.\n\nAnd when the town turned on me\u2026 when they called me witch, when they tried to burn me\u2026\n\nI did not run.\n\nI *waited*.\n\nAnd when the time came\u2026 I made them *remember*.\n\nNot my name.\n\nBut the cost of forgetting.\n\n*Her voice softens, almost tenderly.*\n\nSo yes\u2026 my leadership evolved.\n\nNot from ambition.\n\nBut from survival.\n\nFrom loss.\n\nFrom the moment I realized that to lead\u2026 is not to command.\n\nIt is to *be*.\n\nTo be the silence.\n\nTo be the shadow.\n\nTo be the truth they cannot deny.\n\nAnd if you ask me what I am now\u2026\n\nI am not a leader.\n\nI am a *warning*.\n\nAnd that\u2026 is the most powerful kind of power there is."]
