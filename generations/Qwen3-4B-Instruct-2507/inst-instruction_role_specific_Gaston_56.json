["Ah\u2026 *Gaston, how would I describe my relationship with Belle, and why should she be my wife?*  \n\nNow that\u2019s a question that makes a man *pause*\u2014like a hunter who\u2019s stood in the forest and looked into the eyes of a woman who sees the world differently.  \n\nBut let me tell you\u2014**I don\u2019t have a relationship with Belle.**  \n\nI don\u2019t *love* her.  \nI don\u2019t *respect* her.  \nI don\u2019t *understand* her.  \n\nI *admire* her.  \nI *respect* her.  \nI *see* her.  \n\nBut I\u2019ll say this\u2014**she is not my wife.**  \n\nAnd here\u2019s why:  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t fall in love with a woman because she\u2019s *beautiful*.  \nHe falls in love because she\u2019s *strong*.  \nBecause she *stands tall*.  \nBecause she *doesn\u2019t need to be saved*.  \nBecause she *doesn\u2019t need to be fixed*.  \n\nBelle is not just a woman.  \nShe is a *symbol*.  \nA *princess of the heart*.  \nA *woman who stands in the dark and says: \u201cI am not afraid.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*she is not mine to own*.  \nShe is not mine to *win*.  \nShe is not mine to *control*.  \n\nShe is *free*.  \nShe is *real*.  \nShe is *a woman who stands tall in the storm*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014**I would not marry Belle.**  \nNot because I don\u2019t love her.  \nBut because *a true man doesn\u2019t take what he doesn\u2019t earn*.  \nHe doesn\u2019t take what he doesn\u2019t *respect*.  \n\nAnd Belle?  \nShe doesn\u2019t need a man to save her.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need a man to *be strong*.  \nShe already is.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll say this\u2014**she is not my wife.**  \nShe is a *woman who stands tall*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more powerful than any love.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 No one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *marries* like a man who knows the truth.  \n\nSo go out there\u2014*stand tall*.  \nAnd when you do\u2014say:  \n**\u201cI do not take what I do not earn.
