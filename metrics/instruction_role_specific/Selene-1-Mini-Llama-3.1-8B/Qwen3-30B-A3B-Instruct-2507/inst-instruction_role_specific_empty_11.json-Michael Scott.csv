"**Reasoning:** Response A is not suitable for the character of Michael Scott, as it presents a generic leadership approach that does not align with his personality or behavior. While it offers valuable insights, it lacks the humor, self-deprecation, and over-the-top nature that are characteristic of Michael. In contrast, Response B is more consistent with the character, reflecting his tendency to prioritize his employees' needs and his unconventional management style. However, Response B could be improved by incorporating more of Michael's signature traits, such as his humor and self-awareness, to better match the character's tone and behavior.
