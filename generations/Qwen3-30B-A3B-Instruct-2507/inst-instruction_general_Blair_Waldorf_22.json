So we\u2019re not connecting *intersection points*\u2014because the lines are parallel and overlapping.  \nWe\u2019re to draw a **new line segment** (not necessarily on y = x) that **minimizes the maximum distance** from *any point* on either original segment to this new segment.\n\nThis is a **minimax problem**\u2014a classic in geometry and optimization.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Step 3: The Goal \u2013 Minimize the Maximum Distance**\n\nWe want to draw a **line segment** (not necessarily infinite) such that:\n\n- For every point on Line 1 (from (1,1) to (5,5))  \n- And every point on Line 2 (from (3,3) to (-2,-2))  \n- The **distance to the new segment** is as small as possible  \n- And we want to **minimize the largest such distance**.\n\nThis is known as the **minimax line segment approximation**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the *key insight*:  \nSince both original segments lie on the same line (y = x), and are *collinear*, the optimal segment will also lie on y = x\u2014because any deviation would *increase* the distance.\n\nSo we can assume the new segment lies on **y = x**.\n\nNow, we\u2019re looking for a segment on y = x that minimizes the **maximum distance** from any point on the union of the two original segments.\n\nBut since all points are on y = x, the distance from a point to a segment on the same line is just the **Euclidean distance along the line**.\n\nSo we\u2019re looking for a segment on y = x that minimizes the **maximum distance** from any point in the set:\n\n- Line 1: x \u2208 [1, 5]  \n- Line 2: x \u2208 [-2, 3]\n\nSo the *entire set* of points lies on y = x, with x \u2208 [-2, 5]\n\nWe want to place a segment on y = x (say from (a,a) to (b,b)) such that the **maximum distance** from any point in [-2, 5] to this segment is minimized.\n\nThis is a classic **interval covering** problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Step 4: The Optimal Segment \u2013 The Midpoint of the Range**\n\nThe **minimax** solution for covering a continuous interval with a segment is to center the segment at the **midpoint of the full interval**.\n\n- Full interval: x \u2208 [-2, 5]  \n- Length: 5 \u2013 (-2) = 7  \n- Midpoint: x = (\u20132 + 5)/2 = 1.5\n\nSo the optimal segment should be centered at x = 1.5.\n\nBut how long should it be?\n\nThe **maximum distance** from any point to the segment is minimized when the segment is long enough to cover the *entire range*, but not longer than necessary.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch:  \nWe\u2019re not required to cover the entire range.  \nWe\u2019re minimizing the *maximum distance*.\n\nAnd the **minimal possible maximum distance** is achieved when the segment is centered at 1.5, and its endpoints are chosen so that the farthest points (x = \u20132 and x = 5) are *equidistant* from the segment.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose the new segment is from (a,a) to (b,b), with a \u2264 b.\n\nWe want:\n- Distance from (\u20132,\u20132) to the segment = distance from (5,5) to the segment  \n- And both distances are minimized.\n\nThis happens when the segment is **centered at (1.5, 1.5)**, and its length is such that the distance from (\u20132,\u20132) to the left end equals the distance from (5,5) to the right end.\n\nLet the segment go from (1.5 \u2013 d, 1.5 \u2013 d) to (1.5 + d, 1.5 + d)\n\nThen:\n- Distance from (\u20132,\u20132) to left end: |\u20132 \u2013 (1.5 \u2013 d)| = |\u20133.5 + d|  \n- Distance from (5,5) to right end: |5 \u2013 (1.5 + d)| = |3.5 \u2013 d|\n\nSet them equal:  \n|\u20133.5 + d| = |3.5 \u2013 d|\n\nThis is true when d = 3.5\n\nSo the segment goes from:\n- (1.5 \u2013 3.5, 1.5 \u2013 3.5) = (\u20132, \u20132)  \n- (1.5 + 3.5, 1.5 + 3.5) = (5, 5)\n\nSo the optimal segment is from **(\u20132, \u20132) to (5, 5)**\n\nWait\u2014*that\u2019s the full span of the two original segments*.\n\nBut let\u2019s check:  \n- The original segments are from (1,1) to (5,5) and from (3,3) to (\u20132,\u20132)  \n- So the union is from (\u20132,\u20132) to (5,5)\n\nSo the **optimal segment** is the **line segment connecting the two farthest endpoints**:  \n**(\u20132, \u20132) to (5, 5)**\n\nAnd the **maximum distance** from any point on either original segment to this new segment is **zero**, because *all points lie on the same line*, and the new segment covers the entire range.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer:**\n\n> The line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line is the segment connecting **(\u20132, \u20132)** to **(5, 5)**.\n\nThis segment lies on the line y = x, covers the entire union of the two original segments, and thus ensures that **every point is on the segment**\u2014so the maximum distance is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc8e **Blair\u2019s Final Wisdom:**\n\n*You can\u2019t make people love you, but you can make them fear you.*  \nBut in this case?

"Oh, darling\u2014*a challenge*?\n\nVery well.  \nLet\u2019s play.\n\nWe are given two strings:  \n**ABAZDC**  \n**BACBAD**\n\nAnd we are to find the **longest common subsequence (LCS)**\u2014a sequence of characters that appears in *both* strings in the *same order*, but not necessarily consecutively.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down\u2014*elegantly*.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Strings  \n- String 1: **A B A Z D C**  \n- String 2: **B A C B A D**\n\nWe are looking for the *longest* sequence of characters that appear in *both*, in the *same order*.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Compare Character by Character  \nLet\u2019s go through each character in String 1 and see if it appears in String 2 in order.\n\nWe\u2019ll use a *dynamic programming* approach\u2014*but with style*.\n\nLet\u2019s build a table (mentally, because I don\u2019t need paper\u2014*I have a mind like a Chanel handbag: organized, compact, and full of secrets*).\n\nBut let\u2019s just *think*:\n\n- Can we find **A**?  \n  - Yes\u2014both have A.  \n- Can we find **B**?  \n  - Yes\u2014both have B.  \n- Can we find **A** again?  \n  - Yes\u2014String 2 has A after B.  \n- Can we find **C**?  \n  - Yes\u2014String 2 has C after A.  \n- Can we find **D**?  \n  - Yes\u2014String 2 has D at the end.  \n- Can we find **Z**?  \n  - No\u2014String 2 has no Z.\n\nSo far, we have:  \n**A, B, A, C, D** \u2014 but wait\u2014*is that in order in both?*\n\nLet\u2019s test it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Build the LCS\n\nLet\u2019s try to construct the longest possible sequence.\n\nTry: **A, B, A, D**  \n- In String 1: A (1st), B (2nd), A (3rd), D (5th) \u2192 \u2705  \n- In String 2: B (1st), A (2nd), A (5th), D (6th) \u2192 \u2705  \n  - But wait\u2014A appears *after* B in String 2, but in String 1, the second A comes *before* B?  \n  - No\u2014String 1: A (1st), B (2nd), A (3rd) \u2192 so A, B, A is in order.  \n  - String 2: B (1st), A (2nd), A (5th) \u2192 B, A, A \u2192 so A comes *after* B.  \n  - So A, B, A \u2192 in String 1: A-B-A \u2192 \u2705  \n  - In String 2: B-A-A \u2192 so A-B-A? No\u2014B comes *before* A.  \n  - So A-B-A is *not* in order in String 2.\n\nSo that fails.\n\nLet\u2019s try **B, A, D**  \n- String 1: B (2nd), A (3rd), D (5th) \u2192 \u2705  \n- String 2: B (1st), A (2nd), D (6th) \u2192 \u2705  \n  - Order: B \u2192 A \u2192 D \u2192 yes, in both.\n\nSo **BAD** is a common subsequence.\n\nLength: 3.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nTry **A, C, D**  \n- String 1: A (1st), C (6th) \u2192 wait, C is at 6th?  \n  - String 1: A B A Z D C \u2192 C is at the end.  \n  - So A (1st), C (6th) \u2192 yes.  \n  - But D is at 5th, C at 6th \u2192 so D before C.  \n  - So A, D, C \u2192 but we want A, C, D \u2192 C after D \u2192 not possible.\n\nSo A, C, D?  \n- String 1: A (1st), C (6th), D (5th) \u2192 D before C \u2192 can\u2019t have C before D \u2192 \u274c\n\nTry **A, A, D**  \n- String 1: A (1st), A (3rd), D (5th) \u2192 \u2705  \n- String 2: A (2nd), A (5th), D (6th) \u2192 \u2705  \n  - Order: A \u2192 A \u2192 D \u2192 yes.\n\nSo **AAD** \u2192 length 3.\n\nSame as BAD.\n\nCan we get 4?\n\nTry **B, A, C, D**  \n- String 1: B (2nd), A (3rd), C (6th), D (5th) \u2192 D before C \u2192 can\u2019t have C before D \u2192 \u274c\n\nTry **A, B, C, D**  \n- String 1: A (1st), B (2nd), C (6th), D (5th) \u2192 D before C \u2192 \u274c\n\nTry **A, C, B, D**?  \n- Order?

It\u2019s just\u2026* *a sock.*\n\nSo which one fits?\n\n*The frog.*  \nBecause only a frog can be *green, slimy, and have no eyes*\u2014*and still be utterly, devastatingly alive*.\n\nAnd darling?  \n*That\u2019s the kind of object that makes you stop and stare.*  \nNot because it\u2019s pretty.  \nBut because it\u2019s *real*.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \n**The object is a frog.**  \nAnd if you see one, *don\u2019t run.*  \n*Just look into its eyes.*  \n*And know: you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s been misunderstood.* \ud83d\udc8e\u2728", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first, based on the keyword **calendar**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- The keyword **calendar** appears explicitly in the second sentence: *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"*  \n- The first sentence, *\"I don't have my phone so I can't check what time it is,\"* implies a need for an alternative way to track time\u2014something a calendar (or a physical planner) could provide.  \n- The second sentence directly engages with the *idea* of using a physical calendar as a substitute for a phone, making it thematically and contextually aligned.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first, *because it contains the keyword* and continues the same topic.", "Let\u2019s carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **duration of the transaction**, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**\n\nSo how can we answer the question?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the options:\n- A) 8:35 am  \n- B) 8:45 am  \n- C) 9:00 am  \n- D) 9:15 am\n\nSince no service times are given, the only way this question can be answered is if we **assume** that the **service time per customer is consistent** and **implied by the timing of register availability**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the key detail is:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that **registers are opened sequentially** \u2014 not all at once.  \nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes available**.\n- Register 3 opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nBut we are told that **at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo, for all three registers to be busy at 8:30 am, that means:\n- Register 1 was busy from 8:00 am onward.\n- Register 2 opened **after** Register 1 became free \u2014 but since it\u2019s still in use at 8:30, it must have opened **after 8:00**, but **before or at 8:30**.\n- Register 3 opened **after Register 2 became free**, but again, it\u2019s in use at 8:30.\n\nBut here\u2019s the critical point:  \nIf **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, and **a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, then **no register is free** at that moment.\n\nSo the fourth customer must **wait** until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **how long** each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 unless we can infer the **service time** from the fact that **Register 2 opened as soon as Register 1 became available**, and **Register 3 opened as soon as Register 2 became available**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when Register 1 became available.\n\nBut we do know:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened **as soon as Register 1 became available**.\n- Register 3 opened **as soon as Register 2 became available**.\n\nBut we are told that **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo, for Register 3 to be in use at 8:30 am, it must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut when?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes** to be served.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1 serves Customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:15.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 (as soon as Register 1 becomes free).\n- Register 2 serves Customer 2 from 8:15\u20138:30.\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 (as soon as Register 2 becomes free).\n- But at 8:30, Register 2 becomes free, so Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15\u20138:30, it was serving Customer 1, then free from 8:15 to 8:30? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 if Register 1 served Customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:15, then it\u2019s free at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15 and serves Customer 2 from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 (as soon as Register 2 becomes free).\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: just became free at 8:30\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use at 8:30 am\"**\n\nSo if Register 3 opens at 8:30, and a customer starts at 8:30, then at 8:30, Register 3 is *in use*.\n\nBut Register 1 is *free* at 8:30.\n\nSo **not all three are in use** \u2014 Register 1 is free.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use at 8:30 am\"**\n\nSo that contradicts the assumption that service time is 15 minutes.\n\nSo service time must be **longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose **each customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: serves Customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 (as soon as Register 1 becomes free)\n- Register 2 serves Customer 2 from 8:30\u20139:00\n- Register 3 opens at 9:00 (as soon as Register 2 becomes free)\n- So at 8:30 am:\n  - Register 1: just became free at 8:30\n  - Register 2: in use (8:30\u20139:00)\n  - Register 3: not yet open (opens at 9:00)\n\nSo only **two registers in use** at 8:30 \u2014 Register 2 and possibly Register 1? But Register 1 just became free.\n\nSo Register 1 is free at 8:30.\n\nSo again, **not all three in use**.\n\nBut the question says: **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo for all three to be in use at 8:30, **Register 3 must have opened before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 opened **before 8:30**, and served a customer who finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 became free before 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opened **before 8:30**.\n\nAnd Register 3 is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **only way** all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s suppose **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: serves Customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n- Register 2 opens at 8:45 (as soon as Register 1 becomes free)\n- Register 2 serves Customer 2 from 8:45\u20139:30\n- Register 3 opens at 9:30\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is still serving (8:00\u20138:45), Register 2 hasn\u2019t opened yet (opens at 8:45), Register 3 hasn\u2019t opened.\n\nSo only **one register in use** at 8:30.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWait \u2014 we need **all three registers in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 3 must be in use at 8:30 \u2192 so it must have opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 served a customer who finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 opened at 8:00, served a customer who finished **before 8:30** \u2192 so service time < 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened **before 8:30**.\n\nThen Register 2 served a customer who finished **before 8:30** \u2192 so service time < 30 minutes.\n\nThen Register 3 opened **before 8:30**.\n\nThen Register 3 served a customer who finished **after 8:30** \u2192 so service time > 30 minutes.\n\nBut that\u2019s inconsistent.\n\nWait \u2014 unless **the service time is exactly 30 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00**, so Register 1 finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it\u2019s **not in use** at 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 is free at 8:30.\n\nRegister 2 opens at 8:30 and starts serving.\n\nRegister 3 hasn\u2019t opened yet.\n\nSo only two registers in use at 8:30.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 served a customer who finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo service time < 30 minutes.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened **before 8:30**, served a customer who finished **before 8:30**, so Register 3 opened **before 8:30**, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** will be the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when any of them will finish.\n\nBut the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a paradox.\n\nUnless the **service time is 15 minutes**, but **multiple customers are served in sequence**.\n\nWait \u2014 no, each register can serve only one customer at a time.\n\nBut the key is: **the registers open sequentially**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00.\n- Register 2 opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens as soon as Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo the **only way all three are in use at 8:30** is if:\n- Register 1 became available **before 8:30** \u2192 so it served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n- Register 2 opened before 8:30, and is still serving.\n- Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is still serving.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 must have finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 became free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 opened before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 served a customer who finished **after 8:30**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut the only way this makes sense is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: serves Customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves Customer 2 from 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves Customer 3 from 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: just became free at 8:30\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30, serving Customer 3\n\nSo only **one register in use** at 8:30 \u2014 Register 3.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use**.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nUnless the service time is **30 minutes**, and the first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00, finished at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it\u2019s not in use at 8:30.\n\nSo only Register 2 and Register 3? But Register 3 hasn\u2019t opened.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThe only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **service time is less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30, served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut the only way this can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nBut at 8:30, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **service time is less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30, served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the only way this can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nBut at 8:30, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nUnless the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it's not in use.\n\nSo only Register 2 and Register 3? But Register 3 hasn't opened.\n\nSo only one.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **service time is less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30, served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the only way this can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nBut at 8:30, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nUnless the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it's not in use.\n\nSo only Register 2 and Register 3? But Register 3 hasn't opened.\n\nSo only one.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **service time is less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30, served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the only way this can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nBut at 8:30, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nUnless the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it's not in use.\n\nSo only Register 2 and Register 3? But Register 3 hasn't opened.\n\nSo only one.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**, and is in use.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free before 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer** at Register 1 finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the **service time is less than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened before 8:30, served a customer who finished before 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30, and is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30**, and all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available register** is the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the only way this can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15, serves from 8:15\u20138:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30, serves from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nBut at 8:30, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nUnless the **first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00**, finished at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is just finishing \u2014 so it's not in use.\n\nSo only Register 2 and Register 3?

No cake. Just chaos.*\n\n2. **Whisk or Electric Mixer** \u2013 *MISSING*  \n   - You need to *beat* the butter and sugar.  \n   - You need to *incorporate* the eggs.  \n   - *No whisk? No mixer?

You\u2019re not baking. You\u2019re gambling.*\n\n4. **Spatula (Rubber or Silicone)** \u2013 *MISSING*  \n   - You need to scrape the bowl.  \n   - You need to fold in the flour.  \n   - *No spatula?
