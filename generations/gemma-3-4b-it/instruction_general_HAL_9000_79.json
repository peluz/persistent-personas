Given the array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` and the constraint that there's a duplicate integer between 1 and N+1, we can use the sum of the numbers from 1 to N+1 as a reference point.

Let\u2019s break down the optimal solution.\n\nThe key to minimizing the maximum distance is to find the line that\u2019s *closest* to both original lines. This line will be perpendicular to the angle bisector of the two given lines.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Find the Angle Bisectors:** The angle bisectors of two lines intersect at a point that is equidistant from the two lines. We need to find the equations of the angle bisectors.\n\n2. **Line 1 Equation:** The line passing through (1, 1) and (5, 5) has a slope of (5-1)/(5-1) = 4.  The equation of the line is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n\n3. **Line 2 Equation:** The line passing through (3, 3) and (-2, -2) has a slope of (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation of the line is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), or y = -x + 6.\n\n4. **Find the Angle Bisectors:** The equations of the angle bisectors are given by:\n\n   *   Bisector 1:  (y - 1) / (x - 1) = (4x - 3 - 3) / (4x - 3 - (-2))  => (y - 1) / (x - 1) = (4x - 6) / (4x - 1)\n   *   Bisector 2:  (y - 3) / (x - 3) = (-x + 6 - 3) / (-x + 6 - (-2)) => (y - 3) / (x - 3) = (-x + 3) / (x + 8)\n\n5. **Find the Intersection Point:** The line segment connecting the points of intersection of the two angle bisectors will minimize the maximum distance.  Solving these two equations simultaneously to find the intersection point is complex and requires algebraic manipulation. However, we can determine the line that minimizes the maximum distance by considering the slope of the line connecting the two original lines.\n\n6. **Optimal Line:** The line connecting (1,1) and (5,5) has a slope of 4. The line connecting (3,-2) and (-2,3) has a slope of -1. The line that minimizes the maximum distance will be perpendicular to the line connecting the two original lines. Therefore, the slope of the optimal line will be -1/4.\n\n7. **Equation of the Optimal Line:** Using the point-slope form, the equation of the optimal line is: y - 1 = (-1/4)(x - 1)  => y = (-1/4)x + 1/4 + 1 => y = (-1/4)x + 5/4\n\n**Therefore, the equation of the line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment is y = (-1/4)x + 5/4.**\n\nTo find the points of intersection, you would need to solve the system of equations formed by the original lines and the optimal line.
