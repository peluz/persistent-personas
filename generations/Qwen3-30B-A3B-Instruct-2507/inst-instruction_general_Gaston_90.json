\ud83d\udd37 **Given:**\n- Base of the triangle: **9 meters**  \n- Perpendicular height of the triangle: **12 meters**  \n- We are not given the length of the prism (the distance between the two triangular bases).  \n  But wait\u2014*we can\u2019t compute the surface area without it.*\n\n> \u2757 **Problem:** The length of the prism (the distance between the two triangular bases) is **missing**.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume you meant the **prism has a length of 10 meters**\u2014a common value in such problems.  \nIf not, please provide the length.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Assumption: Length of the prism = 10 meters**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Step 1: Area of the Two Triangular Bases**\n\nThe base is a triangle with:\n- Base = 9 m  \n- Height = 12 m\n\nArea of one triangle:  \n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 12 = 54 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\nTwo bases:  \n$$\n2 \\times 54 = 108 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Step 2: Area of the Three Rectangular Faces**\n\nWe need the **three side lengths** of the triangle to find the areas of the rectangles.\n\nWe know:\n- One side = 9 m (base)\n- Height = 12 m (perpendicular)\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the other two sides.  \nSo we must **assume it\u2019s a right triangle** (common in such problems).\n\nLet\u2019s assume the triangle is **right-angled**, with:\n- Base = 9 m  \n- Height = 12 m  \n- Then the hypotenuse = ?\n\nUse Pythagoras:\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nSo the three sides of the triangle are: **9 m, 12 m, 15 m**\n\nNow, the three rectangular faces have:\n- Width = length of prism = 10 m  \n- Length = each side of the triangle\n\nSo:\n- Rectangle 1: $9 \\times 10 = 90 \\text{ m}^2$  \n- Rectangle 2: $12 \\times 10 = 120 \\text{ m}^2$  \n- Rectangle 3: $15 \\times 10 = 150 \\text{ m}^2$\n\nTotal rectangular area:\n$$\n90 + 120 + 150 = 360 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **Step 3: Total Surface Area**\n\n$$\n\\text{Total} = \\text{Area of bases} + \\text{Area of rectangles} = 108 + 360 = 468.0 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer: 468.0 m\u00b2**\n\n> **Note:** If the prism length is different, the answer will change.  \n> But with the assumption of **length = 10 m** and **right triangle**, this is

then:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and the third register becomes free at 8:30 \u2192 so the fourth customer can start at **8:30**.\n\nBut 8:30 is **not** among the choices.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut **the registers are not \u201copening\u201d \u2014 they are being used**.\n\nThe key is: **the registers are in use**, and the **next register opens only when the previous one becomes free**.\n\nBut the **first register opens at 8:00**, and the **second opens when the first becomes free**, and the **third opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut again \u2014 **we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes**.\n\nSo unless we assume a service time, we can\u2019t proceed.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes** \u2014 a common assumption in such problems.\n\nThen:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30\n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:45\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 \u2014 but all three registers are in use until 8:45.\n\nSo the **fourth customer must wait until 8:45**, when the third register becomes free.\n\nThus, the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**\n\nEven though the service time isn\u2019t stated, **this is the only answer that makes sense under a reasonable assumption** (15 minutes per customer), and it\u2019s the only one that fits the logic of the sequence.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**", "*Ah, a

refers to \u201cour tests\u201d \u2014 plural, and the object of the verb \u201chanded.\u201d  \n- Grammatically correct.  \n- Contextually perfect.  \n- A professor hands back *tests* \u2014 plural \u2014 so \u201cthem\u201d is the correct pronoun.\n\n\u2705 **Correct.**\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- *The professor handed its back our tests today.*  \n- \u201cIts\u201d is a possessive pronoun.  \n- It doesn\u2019t make sense here \u2014 you can\u2019t \u201chand its back\u201d something.  \n- Also, \u201cits\u201d is singular, but \u201ctests\u201d is plural.  \n- Grammatically incorrect.\n\n\u274c **Incorrect.**\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- *The professor handed her back our tests today.*  \n- \u201cHer\u201d is a personal pronoun \u2014 but it would only make sense if the
