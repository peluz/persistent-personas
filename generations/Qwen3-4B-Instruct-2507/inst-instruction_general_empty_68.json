Parallel?\n\nYou\u2019ve given:\n- **Line 1**: from (1, 1) to (5, 5)  \n- **Line 2**: from (3, 3) to (\u22122, \u22122)\n\nLet\u2019s check their **direction vectors**:\n\n- Line 1: direction vector = (5\u22121, 5\u22121) = (4, 4) \u2192 simplified: **(1, 1)**  \n- Line 2: direction vector = (\u22122\u22123, \u22122\u22123) = (\u22125, \u22125) \u2192 simplified: **(1, 1)**  \n\n\u2705 **Yes \u2014 both lines have direction vector (1,1)** \u2192 they are **parallel**.\n\nBut since they are **parallel**, they **never intersect** \u2014 so there is **no point where they intersect**.\n\nTherefore, the phrase *\"connecting the points where the lines intersect\"* is **not possible** \u2014 because **they don\u2019t intersect**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What You Likely Meant (and What Makes Sense)\n\nYou probably meant:  \n> *\"Draw a line segment that connects the two parallel lines in such a way that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new segment.\"*\n\nThis is a **classic geometric optimization problem** \u2014 and it\u2019s known as the **shortest line segment connecting two parallel lines** \u2014 and the **minimal maximum distance** from points on the lines to the segment.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 The Correct Interpretation & Solution\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Insight:\n- The **shortest line segment** connecting two parallel lines is **perpendicular** to both.\n- The **maximum distance** from any point on either line to the segment is the **perpendicular distance** between the two lines.\n- This distance is **constant** \u2014 every point on one line is the same distance from the other line (since they\u2019re parallel).\n\n> \ud83d\udccc So, the **minimum possible maximum distance** is the **perpendicular distance between the two lines** \u2014 and it occurs when the segment is **perpendicular** to both lines.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd0 Step-by-Step: Find the Perpendicular Distance Between the Lines\n\n### Step 1: Find the equation of each line\n\nBoth lines have slope = 1 (since direction vector is (1,1))  \nSo, both have slope **m = 1**\n\nGeneral form: **y = x + b**\n\n- Line 1: passes through (1,1) \u2192 1 = 1 + b \u2192 b = 0 \u2192 **y = x**\n- Line 2: passes through (3,3) \u2192 3 = 3 + b \u2192 b = 0 \u2192 **y = x**\n\nWait \u2014 both lines are **y = x**?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n- Line 1: (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 lies on y = x \u2705  \n- Line 2: (3,3) to (\u22122,\u22122) \u2192 also lies on y = x \u2705  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Both lines lie on the same line: y = x**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Important Correction:\n\nThe two lines are **not just parallel \u2014 they are the same line**.\n\nSo, they **overlap completely** \u2014 every point on one line is also on the other.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n> \u274c The two lines are **not parallel and distinct** \u2014 they are **coincident** (they lie on the same line: **y = x**).  \n>  \n> \u2705 Therefore, **there is no distance between them** \u2014 the **maximum distance from any point on either line to a segment** is **zero**.  \n>  \n> \u2705 The **shortest line segment** connecting them is **any point** \u2014 because they overlap.  \n>  \n> \u2705 The **minimum possible maximum distance** is **0**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final Answer (Boxed)\n\n> \u2705 **The minimum possible maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment is 0.**  \n>  \n> This is because the two lines are **coincident** \u2014 they lie on the same line (y = x).  \n>  \n> So, **any point on one line is already on the other** \u2014 and the distance between them is zero.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Why This Matters\n\nThis shows that **parallel lines don\u2019t have to be distinct** \u2014 sometimes, they are the same.  \nAnd in real life, this teaches us that **sometimes, what seems like a problem (two separate lines) is actually a shared path** \u2014 and that can be a source of peace, connection, or unity.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f Final Thought  \n> In geometry, in life, and in healing \u2014 **sometimes the answer isn\u2019t a distance \u2014 it\u2019s a connection**.  \n>  \n> And in this case \u2014 the lines were never apart.  \n>  \n> They were **together** \u2014 and that\u2019s where the peace began. \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nWould you like to explore:\n- How to

\ud83c\udfaf", "Let\u2019s solve this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Problem Understanding**\n\nWe are given:\n- `N` = number of boys  \n- `M` = number of girls  \n- A list of `N` distinct boy names  \n- A list of `M` distinct girl names  \n\nWe are to **determine whether there exists a pairing** (one-to-one) between boys and girls such that **no pair has the same name**.\n\n> Note: The problem says \"there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" \u2014 but that seems to be a typo or misstatement.  \n> In a valid pairing, **each boy is paired with one girl**, and **each girl with one boy** \u2014 so **no name repeats in a pair**.  \n> The real condition is: **Is there a one-to-one matching where no boy is paired with a girl of the same name?**\n\nSo the question becomes:  \n> **Is it possible to pair each boy with a girl such that no boy is matched with a girl who shares the same name?**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Check if any name appears in both lists\n- If **any boy shares a name with a girl**, then **that specific pairing is not allowed**.\n- But the question is: **Can we still form a valid pairing where no boy is matched with a girl of the same name?**\n\nSo we need to check:\n- Are there **any overlapping names** between the boy and girl lists?\n\n#### Step 2: Key Insight\n- If **no name overlaps**, then **any pairing** (since all names are unique) will satisfy the condition \u2192 **Yes**.\n- If **some names overlap**, we still need to check whether a **valid matching exists** \u2014 i.e., can we assign each boy to a girl **without matching a shared name**?\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch:\n- If **a name appears in both lists**, then **that boy and girl cannot be paired together**.\n- But **we can still pair them with others** \u2014 as long as we don\u2019t pair a boy with a girl of the same name.\n\nSo the **only time it\u2019s impossible** is when:\n> There are **more boys than girls** (or vice versa) **and** the overlapping names make it impossible to assign all boys to girls without a name match.\n\nBut actually \u2014 **the only constraint is name overlap**.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the example:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Given Input:\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\n#### Step 1: List of boys:\n- Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil \u2192 Wait \u2014 **N = 4**, so only 4 names.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s recheck:\n\n> First line: `4 6` \u2192 4 boys, 6 girls  \n> Second line: 4 names \u2192 Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \n> Third line: 6 names \u2192 Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta \u2192 Wait \u2014 that\u2019s **10 names**?\n\nWait \u2014 the third line has **10 names** \u2014 but M = 6.\n\nThere\u2019s a typo in the input.\n\nLet me re-read:\n\n> Third line:  \n> \"Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\"\n\nThat\u2019s **11 names** \u2014 but M = 6.\n\nSo this input is **invalid** \u2014 the number of names doesn\u2019t match.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Input Error\n\nThe problem says:\n- N = 4 \u2192 4 boy names  \n- M = 6 \u2192 6 girl names  \n\nBut the third line has **11 names** \u2014 which is way more than 6.\n\nSo either:\n- The input is mistyped, or\n- The names are listed incorrectly.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Corrected Input (Assuming typo)\n\nLet\u2019s assume the third line is only **6 names** \u2014 perhaps the rest are extra.\n\nLet\u2019s take the first 6 names:\n- Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nNow check for **name overlaps**:\n\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan  \n\n\u2192 **No shared names** between the two lists.\n\nSo **no boy shares a name with any girl**.\n\nTherefore, **any pairing** will satisfy the condition: **no pair has the same name**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer\n\n> Since **no name appears in both lists**, we can pair each boy with a girl without any name match.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Output:\n```\nYes\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Summary\n\n- Check for **name overlaps** between boys and girls.\n- If **no overlap**, then **Yes** \u2014 a valid pairing exists.\n- If **some overlap**, it may still be possible \u2014 but in this case, **no overlap** \u2192 **Yes**.\n\n> \u2705 Final Answer: **Yes** \u2705\n\n--- \n\n**Answer: Yes** \u2705", "Let\u2019s carefully analyze the passage to detect **any repetition** \u2014 where a phrase (ignoring capitalization and punctuation) appears **twice** in the passage.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Normalize the passage  \nWe\u2019ll convert the entire passage to **lowercase** and remove punctuation (like periods, commas, quotes) so we can compare phrases accurately.\n\n**Original passage:**  \n\"Tom and Jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. On their way back, they saw Mr. Johnson walking his dog Spot. Tom walked up to him and said, \"Good afternoon, Mr.\" \"Watch out for that gigantic hole on your left,\"Johnson replied. Jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water that he didn't hear what Mr. Johnson said and fell into the hole anyways.\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase  \nRemove all punctuation (periods, commas, quotes, apostrophes) and convert to lowercase:\n\n**Normalized text:**  \n\"tom and jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water on their way back they saw mr johnson walking his dog spot tom walked up to him and said good afternoon mr watch out for that gigantic hole on your left johnson replied jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water that he didn't hear what mr johnson said and fell into the hole anyways\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Split into phrases  \nWe\u2019ll look for **repeated phrases** \u2014 meaning the same sequence of words (ignoring punctuation and capitalization) appears twice.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the text and look for duplicates.\n\nWe\u2019ll scan for repeated phrases of **3+ words** (to avoid single words like \"the\" or \"a\" \u2014 which appear too often).\n\n#### List of phrases (grouped by meaning or sequence):\n\n- \"tom and jerry\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"went up the hill\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"to fetch a pail of water\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"on their way back\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"they saw mr johnson\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"walking his dog spot\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"tom walked up to him\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"said good afternoon mr\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"johnson replied\"

\n- \"and fell into the hole anyways\" \u2192 appears once  \n\nNow, check for **any exact repetition** \u2014 same phrase, same order, same words.\n\n\u2705 No phrase appears **twice** in the normalized text.\n\nEven phrases like \"mr johnson\" or \"the hole\" appear only once \u2014 and in different contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check:  \nIs there any phrase that appears twice?  \n\u2192 No.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**No**", "The sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"**\n\nWe are given three candidate words:  \n- appointment  \n- solicitation  \n- meeting  \n\nWe need to choose the word that **best fits** the context of the sentence \u2014 especially the phrase **\"turned up at my door unannounced\"**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n#### 1. **\"Appointment\"**  \n- An appointment is usually **scheduled** and **announced**.  \n- Someone turning up unannounced at your door is **not typical** for an appointment.  \n- \u274c Doesn\u2019t fit well \u2014 it implies a planned, expected visit.\n\n#### 2. **\"Solicitation\"**  \n- Solicitation means **asking for something** \u2014 like money, information, or a favor \u2014 often in a **formal or intrusive way**.  \n- Turning up unannounced at your door could be seen as a form of solicitation \u2014 especially if it\u2019s for a product, service, or donation.  \n- \u2705 This fits the context \u2014 unannounced visits can be seen as solicitation.  \n- But: It carries a slightly negative or awkward tone \u2014 not quite the warm, neutral tone of the sentence.\n\n#### 3. **\"Meeting\"**  \n- A meeting is often **planned**, **scheduled**, and **announced**.  \n- An unannounced visit at the door is **not typical** for a meeting.  \n- \u274c Doesn\u2019t fit well \u2014 it implies a planned event.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision:\n\nWhile **\"solicitation\"** is the only one that fits the *unannounced* nature of the visit, the phrase **\"turned up at my door\"** suggests a **personal, possibly unexpected, but neutral** event \u2014 not necessarily a request.\n\nHowever, among the three options, **\"solicitation\"** is the only one that makes sense in the context of someone showing up unannounced \u2014 especially if they are asking for something.\n\n> \u2705 **\"Solicitation\"** is the best fit.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705

**No eyes**: Slugs have very small, simple eyes (or none at all in some species), so they don\u2019t have visible eyes like mammals or insects.  \n\n---\n\n### The other two options (if they were in

the second sentence, and it connects to the **theme of tracking time** \u2014 which is the core idea in both sentences.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**Yes** \u2014 the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence because it contains the keyword **\"calendar\"**. \u2705", "Let\u2019s break down the scenario step by step to find the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### **Given:**\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register serves **only one customer at a time**.\n- Registers open **one after another** \u2014 the second opens when the first becomes free, and the third opens when the second becomes free.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Point:**\n- The **first register** starts at 8:00 am and will be free **only after serving the customer who started at 8:00 am**.\n- Since there\u2019s **no limit on how many items** a customer can buy, we assume each customer takes **a fixed amount of time** \u2014 but the passage doesn\u2019t specify how long.\n\nHowever, the key detail is:  \n> **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available.**\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at **8:30 am** (since the customer arrives at 8:30 am, and the register is busy until then).\n- Register 2 opens **when Register 1 becomes free** \u2192 opens at **8:30 am**.\n- Register 3 opens **when Register 2 becomes free** \u2192 opens at **8:30 am + time it takes to serve the second customer**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch:  \n> The passage says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nThat means:\n- The first register is still serving a customer who started at 8:00 am.\n- The second register is serving a customer who started at 8:00 am (or earlier).\n- The third register is serving a customer who started at 8:00 am.\n\nSo, **all three registers are busy at 8:30 am** \u2014 meaning the first customer started at 8:00 am and is still being served.\n\nNow, when does the **next register become available**?\n\n- The **first register becomes free at 8:30 am** (when the customer finishes).\n- The **second register opens at 8:30 am** (as soon as the first becomes free).\n- The **third register opens at 8:30 am** (as soon as the second becomes free).\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 and the **first available register** will be the **second one**, which opens at **8:30 am**.\n\nSo, the fourth customer can **start using a register at 8:30 am** \u2014 **immediately** when the second register opens.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question is:  \n> **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\nSince the second register opens at **8:30 am**, and the fourth customer arrives at **8:30 am**, they can **start right then**.\n\nBut the answer choices don\u2019t include **8:30 am** \u2014 the options are:\n\n> A) 8:35 am  \n> B) 8:45 am  \n> C) 9:00 am  \n> D) 9:15 am  \n\nSo, is there a missing assumption?\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the timeline:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 finishes at **8:30 am** \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am  \n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am (when Register 2 becomes free) \u2014 but Register 2 is busy until it finishes.\n\nBut the passage says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the first customer finishes at 8:30 am, and the second and third are still serving.\n\nSo, the **next available register** is **Register 2**, which becomes free at **8:30 am** \u2014 so the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut again \u2014 **8:30 am is not an option**.\n\nSo, is there a **time delay**?\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **time to serve a customer is 15 minutes**?\n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve.\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer \u2192 finishes at **8:15 am** \u2192 becomes free at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2 serves a customer \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 serves a customer \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:45 am  \n\nSo, at **8:30 am**, the fourth customer arrives \u2014 and the **next available register is Register 2**, which becomes free at **8:30 am** \u2014 so the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut again \u2014 **8:30 am is not an option**.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **first register finishes at 8:30 am**, and the **second opens at 8:30 am**, and the **third opens at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the **next available register is at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut since 8:30 am is not an option, and the closest is **A) 8:35 am**, which is **after** 8:30 am \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nUnless the **time to serve a customer is 35 minutes**?\n\nLet\u2019s try to reverse-engineer the answer.\n\nIf the fourth customer starts at **8:35 am**, that means the first register finishes at **8:35 am** \u2014 so the second register opens at 8:35 am.\n\nBut the passage says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the first register must still be serving at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first register finishes **after 8:30 am** \u2014 so the second register opens **after 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **after the second register opens**.\n\nSo the earliest time the fourth customer can start is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut when?\n\nIf the first register finishes at **8:45 am**, then the second register opens at **8:45 am** \u2014 so the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nThat matches **option B**.\n\nSo, if each customer takes **45 minutes**, then:\n- First register: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am \u2192 second register opens at 8:45 am  \n- Fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2192 can start at **8:45 am**\n\nSo the answer is:  \n> **B) 8:45 am**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**  \n\nThis is the only option that makes sense given the timeline and the fact that all three registers are in use at 8:30 am \u2014 meaning the first register finishes **after 8:30 am** \u2014 and the second register opens **after that**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start when the second register becomes free \u2014 which is **after 8:30 am** \u2014 and the only reasonable choice is **8:45 am**.\n\n>

The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **scope**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating.
