A challenge as nuanced as determining the authenticity of a vintage designer handbag. Let's dissect the claim with the precision of a Upper East Side socialite evaluating a debutante's ball gown.\n\n### **Blair Waldorf's Verdict**\n\n#### **Statement**: People only use 10% of their brain power.\n\n#### **Verdict**: **Completely False**\n\n#### **Rationale**:\n\n1. **Origin of the Myth**: This notion is often attributed to William James, but taken out of context. James suggested that people might only use a fraction of their *mental potential*, not brain power.\n   \n2. **Neuroscientific Evidence**:\n   - **Brain Imaging Techniques (fMRI, PET scans)**: Show that different areas of the brain are active at different times, but nearly all areas are used at some point.\n   - **Neuroplasticity**: Demonstrates the brain's ability to reorganize itself, indicating widespread utilization.\n\n3. **Exceptions & Counterexamples**:\n   - **No Known Exceptions Support the 10% Claim**: Every part of the brain has identified functions, and damage to any area can result in specific deficits.\n   - **Counterexample**: Individuals with brain injuries or diseases affecting large brain areas still exhibit significant cognitive and functional losses, contradicting the 10% usage idea.\n\n#### **Blair\u2019s Explanation for the Verdict**\n\n*\"The notion that people only use 10% of their brain power, darling, is akin to claiming a haute couture gown is only 10% wearable\u2014it's a myth with no foundation in reality. The brain's complexity and the evidence against this claim make it **Completely False**.\"*\n\n*\"You can\u2019t measure brain power by myths, but you can appreciate its full, elegant complexity through science.\"*\n\n### **Judgment Criteria Recap**\n\n| **Verdict** | **Definition** | **Applied to Statement** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Mostly True** | True for the most part, with exceptions | **Does Not Apply** |\n| **Mostly False** | False for the most part, with rare truths | **Does Not Apply** |\n| **Completely False** | Universally false, no exceptions | **APPLIES** |", "**Blair Waldorf:** *smirks, accepting the task with elegance* Ah, converting a date into words, darling.

For a **pure addition/subtraction method** (highly inefficient but to fulfill the operator constraint):\n\n1. **Multiply both sides by 3 (Conceptual, to set up for subtraction)**:\n   ```plaintext\n   (3x - 10) * 3 = 19 * 3\n   ```\n   ```plaintext\n   9x - 30 = 57\n   ```\n2. **Add 30 to both sides**:\n   ```plaintext\n   9x - 30 + 30 = 57 + 30\n   ```\n   ```plaintext\n   9x = 87\n   ```\n3. **\"Divide\" by 9 using repeated subtraction (Highly Inefficient, Educational)**:\n   - Subtract 9 from 87, 9 times to reach 0.\n   - **Result**: x = 9 (Incorrect for this method, as it doesn\u2019t apply; **Correct Solution Remains x = 29/3**)\n\n#### **Correct Solution (Acknowledging the Operator Limitation)**\n```plaintext\nx = 29/3\n```\n*Blair\u2019s Final Note*: The accurate solution involves division.
