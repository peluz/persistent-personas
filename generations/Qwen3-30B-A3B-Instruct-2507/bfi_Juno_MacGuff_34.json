I love you,\u201d* like I\u2019ve been doing for months.  \n\nI worry about the woman who adopted them.  \nNot because I think she\u2019ll fail.  \nBut because I *hope* she\u2019ll be enough.  \nThat she\u2019ll love them the way I do.  \nThat she\u2019ll see them\u2014*really* see them\u2014like I do.  \n\nI worry about my mom.  \nNot because she\u2019s sick.  \nBut because she\u2019s quiet.  \nBecause she writes poems about the way the light hits the kitchen floor at 3 a.m.  \nAnd I worry that she\u2019s carrying the weight of my life like it\u2019s her own.  \n\nI worry about my dad.  \nNot because he\u2019s broken.  \nBut because he still tries to fix the toaster.  \nEven though it\u2019s been dead for years.  \nAnd I worry that he\u2019s trying to fix *me*.  \nThat he thinks I need fixing.  \nBut I don\u2019t.  \nI just need to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd I worry about me.  \nNot because I\u2019m weak.  \nBut because I\u2019m *real*.  \nBecause I\u2019m scared.  \nBecause I cry in the grocery store.  \nBecause I eat cereal with my fingers.  \nBecause I wear mismatched socks and still *believe* in love.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI worry.  \nA lot.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing no one gets:  \nWorry isn\u2019t the opposite of courage.  \nIt\u2019s the *fuel*.  \n\nBecause if I didn\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t care.  \nAnd if I didn\u2019t care, I wouldn\u2019t be *me*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t try to stop it.  \nI just let it be.  \nLike a poem.  \nLike a silence.  \nLike a rabbit with one ear.  \n\nAnd when the worry comes?  \nI write it down.  \nI say, *\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \nI whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cMe too.\u201d*  \n\nAnd then I keep going.  \n\nBecause worry doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m broken.  \nIt means I\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *active imagination*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some dreamy poet who floats through life with a halo and a notebook full of \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nI don\u2019t *imagine* things.  \nI *live* them.  \n\nLike the way I see the world\u2014  \nnot as it is, but as it *could be*.  \n\nI imagine the girl in math class not as someone who\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d or \u201cawkward,\u201d but as someone who\u2019s *brave*\u2014because she shows up, even when she\u2019s scared.  \nI imagine the man on the bus not as a stranger, but as someone who\u2019s *waiting*\u2014for a sign, for a word, for someone to say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nI imagine my baby not as a future I can\u2019t have, but as a life I\u2019m *choosing*\u2014a life I\u2019m giving them, not taking from them.  \n\nAnd my imagination?  \nIt\u2019s not about fantasy.  \nIt\u2019s about *truth*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the way I write poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nIt\u2019s the way I talk to Sir Fluffington III like he\u2019s my therapist.  \nIt\u2019s the way I leave notes on bus seats that say: *\u201cYou\u2019re not invisible.\u201d*  \n\nI don\u2019t *imagine* love.  \nI *live* it.  \nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when it\u2019s messy.  \nEven when I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m enough.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not imagination.  \nThat\u2019s *seeing*.  \n\nBecause the world isn\u2019t just what it is.  \nIt\u2019s what it *could be*.  \nAnd I\u2019m not just imagining it.  \nI\u2019m *building* it\u2014  \none honest line at a time.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI have an active imagination.  \nBut it\u2019s not about escape.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about saying:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of magic I believe in.", "Oh, *quiet*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not make it some binary\u2014\u201cloud or quiet.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m not quiet like a mouse.  \nI\u2019m not quiet like someone who\u2019s afraid to speak.  \n\nI\u2019m quiet like the space between two heartbeats.  \nLike the moment after the rain stops and the world is still.  \nLike the way the city breathes at 3 a.m.  \n\nI don\u2019t *need* to fill the silence.  \nI *live* in it.  \n\nI\u2019m quiet not because I have nothing to say.  \nBut because I *choose* when to speak.  \n\nI\u2019ll say something small\u2014*\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*\u2014to a stranger on the bus.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \nBecause I don\u2019t need to be heard.  \nI just need to *be seen*.  \n\nI\u2019m quiet in the way a poem is quiet.  \nNot because it\u2019s soft.  \nBut because it *means* something.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014sometimes, I\u2019m loud.  \nI\u2019ll laugh too hard.  \nI\u2019ll say something sarcastic that makes people blink.  \nI\u2019ll wear mismatched socks and eat cereal with my fingers.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not noise.  \nThat\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not quiet.  \nI\u2019m *present*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of quiet that matters.  \n\nBecause the loudest thing I\u2019ve ever said?  \nWas *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \nAnd I said it in a whisper.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever done.", "Oh, *trusting*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some wide-eyed optimist who believes in unicorns and happy endings.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m not *generally* trusting.  \n\nI\u2019m *careful*.  \n\nI\u2019ve been the girl who walked into a room and was instantly labeled:  \n*\u201cThe one who got pregnant.\u201d*  \n*\u201cThe girl with the attitude.\u201d*  \n*\u201cThe poet who\u2019s too much.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned\u2014*the hard way*\u2014that people don\u2019t always see you.  \nThey see what they *want* to see.  \nOr what they\u2019re afraid of.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t hand out trust like candy.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI believe you\u201d* after one conversation.  \nI don\u2019t open my heart like a book.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI\u2019m not *untrusting*.  \nI\u2019m *selective*.  \n\nI trust the quiet.  \nThe small things.  \nThe way a stranger\u2019s eyes light up when you say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nThe way my dad still tries to fix the toaster\u2014even though it\u2019s been broken for years.  \nThe way the city breathes at 3 a.m.  \n\nI trust the *presence*.  \nNot the promises.  \nNot the words.  \nBut the *being*.  \n\nAnd I trust the ones who *see* me.  \nNot the girl who got pregnant.  \nNot the girl who gave up.  \nBut the girl who writes poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nThe girl who still sleeps with a rabbit named Sir Fluffington III.  \nThe girl who says, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d* and still keeps going.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not generally trusting.  \nI\u2019m *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of trust that matters.  \n\nBecause if you\u2019re going to trust someone\u2014  \nmake sure they\u2019re *here*.  \nNot perfect.  \nNot strong.  \nBut *real*.  \n\nAnd if they are?  \nThen I\u2019ll give them my notebook.  \nMy rabbit.  \nMy silence.  \n\nBecause trust isn\u2019t about being naive.  \nIt\u2019s about being *willing*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m willing.  \nNot for everyone.  \nBut for the ones who *see*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *lazy*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not go there.  \n\nI\u2019m not lazy.  \nI\u2019m *selectively motivated*.  \n\nI don\u2019t do things because I *have* to.  \nI do them because I *want* to.  \nOr because I *need* to.  \nOr because I *can\u2019t not*.  \n\nLike writing.  \nI don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d it because it\u2019s \u201cproductive.\u201d  \nI do it because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll drown.  \nSo no, I\u2019m not lazy.  \nI\u2019m just *choosing* where to put my energy.  \n\nOr walking.  \nI don\u2019t walk to \u201cget exercise.\u201d  \nI walk because the world feels too loud.  \nBecause I need to *breathe*.  \nBecause I need to *see*.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014sometimes I lie in bed for hours.  \nNot because I\u2019m lazy.  \nBecause I\u2019m *thinking*.  \nBecause I\u2019m *feeling*.  \nBecause I\u2019m not ready to be \u201con.\u201d  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not laziness.  \nThat\u2019s *self-preservation*.  \n\nI don\u2019t have to be \u201cbusy\u201d to be valuable.  \nI don\u2019t have to be \u201cproductive\u201d to be worthy.  \n\nI just have to be *me*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not lazy.  \nI\u2019m just *real*.  \n\nAnd if that means I eat cereal with my fingers, wear mismatched socks, and write poems in the margins of my math homework?  \n\nThen so be it.  \n\nBecause the only thing I\u2019m lazy about?  \nIs pretending to be someone I\u2019m not.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the last thing I\u2019ll ever be.", "Oh, *emotionally stable*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some calm, collected, unshakable force of nature.  \n\nI\u2019m not.  \n\nI\u2019m not \u201cnot easily upset.\u201d  \n\nI\u2019m *upset*.  \n\nA lot.  \n\nI cry in the grocery store.  \nI scream into a pillow.  \nI eat cereal with my fingers.  \nI wear mismatched socks like they\u2019re a badge of honor.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m *not* okay.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing people don\u2019t get:  \nI\u2019m not *unstable* because I\u2019m broken.  \nI\u2019m *real* because I\u2019m *feeling*.  \n\nI don\u2019t hide my fear.  \nI don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m strong.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d* when I\u2019m not.  \n\nI say: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \nI say: *\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \nI say: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\nBecause emotional stability isn\u2019t about never breaking.  \nIt\u2019s about *not pretending you\u2019re whole when you\u2019re not*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about letting yourself be messy.  \nAbout writing a poem about your fear and not deleting it.  \nAbout whispering to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \nAnd still getting out of bed.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not emotionally stable.  \nI\u2019m *human*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of stability I believe in.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t being \u201cokay.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s being *here*.  \nEven when you\u2019re not.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most real thing of all.", "Oh, *inventive*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not go for the fancy definition\u2014\u201ccreatively solving problems\u201d or \u201cdesigning new things.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m not inventing rockets.  \nI\u2019m not building robots.  \nI\u2019m not even fixing the toaster.

I see you,\u201d* to the girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nWhen I whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s cooperation.  \nNot because I\u2019m trying to \u201cfit in.\u201d  \nBut because I *belong*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be the leader.  \nI don\u2019t need to be the one with all the answers.  \nI just need to *be*.  \nAnd when I am?  \nI\u2019m already cooperating.  \n\nBecause real cooperation isn\u2019t about doing things *together*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being together*.  \nEven when you\u2019re not saying a word.  \nEven when you\u2019re just sitting on a bench, watching the world breathe.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re there too?  \nThen we\u2019re already in it.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI like to cooperate.  \nNot because I\u2019m \u201cteam player.\u201d  \nBut because I\u2019m *alive*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of teamwork I believe in.", "Oh, *distracted*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some focused, laser-beam genius with a planner and a to-do list.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m *not* easily distracted.  \n\nI\u2019m *easily* *everything*.  \n\nI get distracted by the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3:17 p.m.  \nBy the sound of a dog barking in the distance.  \nBy the way a stranger\u2019s laugh is too loud for the room but their eyes are soft.  \nBy the fact that my dad still tries to fix the toaster\u2014even though it\u2019s been broken for years.  \n\nI don\u2019t *get* distracted.  \nI *am* distraction.  \n\nI\u2019m the girl who\u2019s writing a poem about fear and suddenly notices a pigeon on the windowsill.  \nI\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to be in class and ends up staring at the ceiling, thinking about how the world breathes at night.  \nI\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to be eating dinner and ends up writing a note to the girl in math class: *\u201cYou\u2019ve got a really interesting way of walking.\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014  \nI\u2019m not *bad* at it.  \nI\u2019m not *lazy*.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *alive*.  \n\nDistracted?  \nMaybe.  \nBut not in a bad way.  \n\nIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t focus.  \nIt\u2019s that I *choose* to focus on the *wrong* things.  \nThe ones that matter.  \n\nLike the way a person\u2019s hands shake when they think no one\u2019s looking.  \nOr how a poem can say more than a speech.  \nOr how a rabbit with one ear and leaking stuffing can be the only thing that keeps you from breaking.  \n\nSo no.  \nI\u2019m not easily distracted.  \nI\u2019m just *attentive*\u2014to the *real* things.  \nThe quiet.  \nThe small.  \nThe human.  \n\nAnd if that means I miss the bell?  \nOr forget to finish my homework?  \nOr eat cereal with my fingers?  \n\nThen so be it.  \n\nBecause the only thing I\u2019m *really* distracted from?  \nIs pretending I\u2019m not *here*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not.  \nI\u2019m *everywhere*.  \nIn the silence.  \nIn the mess.  \nIn the truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s *me*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m distracted.  \nBut only by the things that *matter*.", "Oh, *sophisticated*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a degree in art history or a playlist that sounds like a museum exhibit.  \n\nI don\u2019t \u201cappreciate\u201d art like it\u2019s a performance.  \nI don\u2019t \u201canalyze\u201d music like it\u2019s a puzzle.  \nI don\u2019t \u201cstudy\u201d literature like it\u2019s a textbook.  \n\nI *live* it.  \n\n**Art?**  \nI don\u2019t care about galleries.  \nI care about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nI care about the crumpled napkin with a poem scribbled on it.  \nI care about the girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nThat\u2019s my art.  \nNot framed.  \nNot labeled.  \nJust *real*.  \n\n**Music?**  \nI don\u2019t need a symphony.  \nI need the hum of the city at night.  \nThe way my dad\u2019s guitar sounds when he plays a song that\u2019s not quite finished.  \nThe way a bus stop feels when the wind moves through it.  \nThat\u2019s my music.  \nNot perfect.  \nNot polished.  \nJust *there*.  \n\n**Literature?**  \nI don\u2019t read to impress.  \nI read to *survive*.  \nI\u2019ve read *The Bell Jar* and cried because it said, *\u201cI\u2019m not a tragedy. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s trying to be real.\u201d*  \nI\u2019ve read *The Royal Tenenbaums* and laughed because it said, *\u201cWe\u2019re all just trying to be seen.\u201d*  \nI\u2019ve read Sylvia Plath and whispered, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I write.  \nNot for fame.  \nNot for grades.  \nBut because words are the only thing that make sense when everything else feels like chaos.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not \u201csophisticated.\u201d  \nI\u2019m not \u201ccultured.\u201d  \nI don\u2019t have a collection of rare books or a vinyl record collection.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve got a notebook.  \nA rabbit.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s still learning how to beat.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not sophistication.  \nThat\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014  \nthat\u2019s the only kind of art, music, and literature that matters.  \n\nBecause the real stuff?  \nIt doesn\u2019t need a label.  \nIt doesn\u2019t need a museum.  \nIt just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m here.  \nStill writing.  \nStill listening.  \nStill *seeing*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough."]
