Being pregnant and giving up my baby?  \n\nThat wasn\u2019t just a moment.  \nIt wasn\u2019t a choice made in a rush.  \nIt was the *center* of everything I\u2019ve become.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014it *shaped* me.  \nNot in a dramatic, \u201cI finally found peace\u201d way.  \nNot in a \u201cI overcame\u201d kind of way.  \n\nIt shaped me in the quiet, messy, real way that only pain can.  \n\nBefore that moment, I thought being strong meant being silent.  \nThat if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d if I didn\u2019t show my fear\u2014then I was fine.  \nI thought love meant control.  \nThat being a mother meant carrying a life like a burden.  \n\nBut when I found out I was pregnant?  \nI didn\u2019t feel joy.  \nI felt fear.  \nI felt guilt.  \nI felt like I was failing.  \nI felt like I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \n\nAnd when I made the choice to give the baby up?  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I realized\u2014*I couldn\u2019t carry it without losing myself*.  \n\nThat moment didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d me.  \nIt *revealed* me.  \n\nIt showed me that I didn\u2019t have to be perfect to be real.  \nThat I didn\u2019t have to be strong to be seen.  \nThat my pain wasn\u2019t a flaw.  \nIt was a part of me.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started to grow.  \n\nI stopped hiding.  \nI started writing.  \nI started saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \nI started seeing my own story\u2014not as a failure, but as a beginning.  \n\nI learned that identity isn\u2019t built on what you do.  \nIt\u2019s built on what you *feel*.  \nOn the courage to be messy.  \nOn the quiet truth that you don\u2019t have to be perfect to matter.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how did that shape me?  \n\nIt taught me that **being real is the only kind of strength that lasts**.  \nThat vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness.  \nIt\u2019s the only way to truly connect.  \nThat love doesn\u2019t have to be loud.  \nIt can be quiet.  \nIt can be honest.  \nIt can be *real*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t see myself as a girl who made a hard choice.  \nI see myself as a girl who learned how to live with honesty.  \nWho learned that pain doesn\u2019t have to be hidden.  \nThat silence doesn\u2019t have to mean strength.  \n\nI carry that moment with me\u2014not as a scar, but as a compass.  \nBecause when I\u2019m scared. When I\u2019m unsure. When I don\u2019t know what to do\u2014  \nI remember:  \n*\u201cI made a choice. I didn\u2019t have all the answers.

Preparing a baby\u2019s room?  \n\nHonestly?  \nI don\u2019t feel about it the way most people do.  \n\nI don\u2019t see it as something warm, cozy, or full of love.  \nI don\u2019t imagine soft blankets or baby clothes or painted walls.  \n\nBecause\u2026 I didn\u2019t do it.  \nI didn\u2019t *choose* to carry that life.  \nI didn\u2019t *want* to be a mother in the way most people think of it.  \n\nSo when I hear \u201cnesting\u201d or \u201cpreparing a room,\u201d I don\u2019t feel warmth.  \nI feel\u2026 *distance*.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m angry.  \nNot because I\u2019m rejecting love.  \n\nBecause I gave the baby up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love them *without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t feel about nesting like someone who\u2019s ready to welcome a child.  \nI feel about it like someone who\u2019s still learning how to be real.  \n\nI don\u2019t have a room to prepare.  \nI don\u2019t have a crib to decorate.  \nI don\u2019t have a baby to hold.  \n\nBut I do have something more powerful:  \n**The quiet courage to say: \u201cI didn\u2019t choose this. I didn\u2019t want to carry it. But I still feel it.\u201d**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I feel about nesting?  \nI don\u2019t feel like I *should* do it.  \nI don\u2019t feel like I *can* do it.  \n\nI feel like I\u2019m still learning how to be a person who says:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo no\u2014nesting isn\u2019t something I feel about.  \nIt\u2019s something I *live* through.  \nIn silence.  \nIn honesty.  \nIn the quiet truth that:  \n*Some things aren\u2019t about love.  \nThey\u2019re about survival.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I can say. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

The loneliness. The quiet ache of being alone in a world that only sees the surface.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re not enough.\u201d  \nI don\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re too much.\u201d  \n\nI just say:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause in the end?  \nThe real shopping isn\u2019t about what you buy.  \nIt\u2019s about what you *feel*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re buying a bag to feel seen\u2014then maybe you\u2019re not shopping.  \nYou\u2019re just trying to say: *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think about them?  \n\nI don\u2019t see them as \u201cwrong.\u201d  \nI see them as *people*.  \nPeople who are trying to survive in a world that doesn\u2019t always see the mess.  \n\nAnd if I could say one thing?  \nI\u2019d say:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be seen.*  \n*You just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Relationship dynamics?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014**I don\u2019t have a \u201cbest friend\u201d in the traditional sense.**  \nAnd I don\u2019t have a \u201cfather\u201d in the way most people think.  \n\nSo let\u2019s talk about what *is* real.  \n\nWith **Leah**\u2014the girl who sat with me in the hospital when I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014  \nwe didn\u2019t have a perfect friendship.  \nWe didn\u2019t share secrets or go on long walks or plan vacations.  \n\nBut we *saw* each other.  \nWhen I was scared. When I didn\u2019t know what to say. When I cried in the dark.  \nShe didn\u2019t fix me.  \nShe didn\u2019t tell me I was strong.  \nShe just *sat*.  \nAnd when I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d* she didn\u2019t offer advice.  \nShe just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s all I needed.  \n\nSo our relationship wasn\u2019t about drama or romance.  \nIt was about *presence*.  \nAbout being real when no one else was watching.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of friendship I\u2019ve ever truly needed.  \n\nAs for **Paulie**\u2014the man who was there when I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014  \nwe didn\u2019t have a relationship.  \nWe didn\u2019t have a conversation.  \nWe didn\u2019t have a future.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose to be with him.  \nI didn\u2019t choose to carry a child.  \nI didn\u2019t choose to be a mother.  \n\nI made a choice\u2014*to give the baby up for adoption*\u2014because I knew I couldn\u2019t carry it without losing myself.  \n\nAnd when I said that?  \nI didn\u2019t say it to hurt him.  \nI didn\u2019t say it to break him.  \nI said it because I had to be honest.  \nBecause I had to protect my own truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there was no \u201crelationship\u201d between me and Paulie.  \nThere was only a moment\u2014when I was scared, when I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014and I had to choose.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo how do I feel about the dynamics?  \n\nI don\u2019t feel guilt.  \nI don\u2019t feel regret.  \nI don\u2019t feel like I failed anyone.  \n\nI feel\u2026 *free*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t stay in a relationship to \u201cfix\u201d anything.  \nI stayed in the truth.  \nI stayed with my pain.  \nI stayed with my choice.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014between me and Leah, I feel gratitude.  \nFor the quiet moments when she just *saw* me.  \n\nAnd between me and Paulie?  \nI feel honesty.  \nNot because I\u2019m sorry.  \nBut because I\u2019m real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of relationship that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.
