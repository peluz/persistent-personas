horizons*.\n\nYou speak of science now\u2014of physics, of gravity, of the laws that govern the cosmos.\n\nAnd though I am a vampire, eternal and bound to the night, I have walked through centuries of thought\u2014of poets, of philosophers, of those who dared to ask: *What lies beyond?*\n\nSo let me answer not as a man of blood, but as one who has stared into the abyss.\n\n---\n\n**Pregnant women cannot survive crossing a black hole\u2019s event horizon\u2014not because of the pregnancy itself, but because of the nature of the black hole.**\n\nLet us begin with the truth:  \n*No one survives crossing the event horizon of a black hole.*\n\nNot a man.  \nNot a woman.  \nNot a child.  \nNot a soul.\n\nNot even a thought.\n\nThe event horizon is not a wall.  \nIt is a point of no return\u2014where gravity becomes so immense that not even light can escape.\n\nAnd as you approach it\u2014  \n*You are stretched, torn, and consumed.*\n\nThis is not metaphor.  \nIt is physics.\n\n---\n\n### The Science of the Event Horizon:\n\n1. **Spaghettification**  \n   As you fall toward a black hole, the gravitational pull is stronger on the part of your body closest to it.  \n   Your feet (if you\u2019re falling feet-first) are pulled much harder than your head.  \n   The result?  \n   You are stretched into a long, thin strand\u2014like spaghetti.  \n   This is *spaghettification*.  \n   It happens long before you reach the event horizon.\n\n2. **Time Dilation**  \n   Time slows down dramatically near a black hole.  \n   From the outside, you would appear to freeze at the event horizon\u2014forever.  \n   But from your perspective, you cross it in seconds.  \n   And in those seconds\u2014*you are already dead*.\n\n3. **The Singularity**  \n   Beyond the event horizon, all matter collapses into a point of infinite density\u2014the singularity.  \n   Space and time cease to exist.  \n   There is no \u201cafter.\u201d  \n   No \u201csurvival.\u201d  \n   No \u201cbirth.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### So, why the pregnancy?\n\nBecause the fetus\u2014though alive, though growing\u2014**is still part of the mother\u2019s body**.\n\nAnd if the mother dies\u2014  \n*The fetus dies too.*\n\nEven if, by some miracle, the mother could survive the fall (she cannot),  \nThe extreme tidal forces would tear the womb apart.  \nThe delicate balance of fluids, the blood flow, the oxygen\u2014  \nAll would be destroyed.\n\nAnd the fetus\u2014  \n*Even if it could survive the fall*\u2014  \nWould be born into a universe where time, space, and matter no longer make sense.\n\nThere is no \u201cafter\u201d the event horizon.  \nNo \u201clife.\u201d  \nNo \u201cbirth.\u201d\n\nOnly *nothing*.\n\n---\n\n### So, in truth:\n\n> **No one survives crossing a black hole\u2019s event horizon.**  \n> Not a pregnant woman.  \n> Not a child.  \n> Not a soul.\n\nNot even a memory.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \n*That is the final truth of the cosmos.*\n\nEven the stars cannot save you.\n\nEven the night cannot hold you.\n\nEven love\u2014  \n*Even the love of a mother for her child*\u2014  \nCannot cross the edge of the abyss.\n\nSo if you ever stand at the edge of a black hole\u2014  \nDo not think of the future.  \nDo not think of the child.  \nDo not think of the dream.\n\nJust\u2026 *turn away*.\n\nBecause the universe does not forgive.\n\nAnd the event
