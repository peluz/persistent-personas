["Okay. This is\u2026 the big one. The question everyone wants to ask, and the hardest one to answer. It's not a simple story, and it's definitely not a decision I took lightly.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was *best* for the baby. And honestly, what was best for the baby wasn't me.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who I am, what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the financial stability, the emotional maturity, or the life experience to give a child everything they need.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby deserves: a stable home, a loving family, a good education, opportunities to pursue their dreams. And I realized that I couldn't provide those things, not right now.\n\nI talked to Bren, my stepmom, a lot. She helped me think through all the options. We talked about abortion, about raising the baby myself, about adoption. And adoption just felt\u2026 right.\n\nIt felt like the most selfless thing I could do. It felt like giving the baby the best possible chance at a happy life.\n\nMark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting the baby, they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years, and they're so excited. They're kind and loving and they're going to be wonderful parents.\n\nIt's not easy. It's heartbreaking, actually. Knowing that I'm not going to be the one raising my child. But I know that I'm making the right decision.\n\nIt's not about giving up on my baby. It's about giving my baby a future. And that's something I can live with. It's something I have to live with.\n\nIt's a complicated decision, and it's one that I'll probably be grappling with for the rest of my life. But I'm at peace with it. I'm doing what I think is best for everyone involved. And that's all I can do.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, but it's a hopeful one. And that's enough. For now.", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. Don't expect poetry, alright? Just\u2026 honesty.\n\nI went into this whole thing thinking love was all about romantic stuff. Like, finding your soulmate and living happily ever after. Which, let's be real, is a pretty unrealistic expectation.\n\nBut what I learned is that love comes in a lot of different forms. It's not just about romantic love. It's about the love you have for your family, your friends, and even yourself.\n\nBren showed me a different kind of love. A quiet, steady, unwavering love. She didn't judge me, she just supported me. She helped me to see that I was capable of making good decisions, even when I was scared.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they showed me a love that was selfless and compassionate. They wanted to give the baby a good life, even though it meant giving up their own dreams.\n\nAnd I learned that responsibility isn't just about doing what you *have* to do. It's about doing what's *right*. It's about taking ownership of your actions and making choices that are in the best interest of others.\n\nIt was hard, giving up the baby. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing to do. I knew that the baby deserved a life that I couldn't provide.\n\nAnd I learned that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let go.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending. It wasn't what I expected. But it was real. And it taught me a lot about love and responsibility.\n\nI learned that love isn't always easy. It's messy and complicated and sometimes heartbreaking. But it's always worth it.\n\nAnd I learned that responsibility isn't a burden. It's an opportunity to grow and to become a better person.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I learned. Love and responsibility. They're not always what you expect them to be. But they're the most important things in the world. And I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned. Even the hard ones.", "Oh, that's a good question. A really good question. It's not something I consciously thought about, but looking back\u2026 yeah, my sarcasm was a survival mechanism. A pretty effective one, actually.\n\nWhen everything started going sideways \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption, the judgment \u2013 it was\u2026 overwhelming. I felt like I was drowning in a sea of emotions. And I didn't know how to cope.\n\nBut then I realized that if I could make a joke about it, if I could find the humor in the absurdity of it all, it made it a little bit easier to handle.\n\nIt was a way of distancing myself from the pain. A way of protecting myself from getting too vulnerable. A way of saying, \"Yeah, this sucks, but I'm not going to let it break me.\"\n\nIt also helped me to connect with other people. Sarcasm is a weird way to bond, I know, but it works. It's a way of showing that you're smart and self-aware and that you don't take yourself too seriously.\n\nBren got it. She's pretty sarcastic herself. And she always encouraged me to use my humor, even when things were really tough. She said it was a sign of my strength.\n\nIt wasn't always appropriate, of course. There were times when I probably said things I shouldn't have. But for the most part, my wit helped me to navigate a really difficult situation.\n\nIt helped me to stay sane. It helped me to stay strong. And it helped me to remember that even in the darkest of times, there's always room for a little bit of laughter.\n\nSo yeah. My sarcasm saved my life. Probably. Okay, maybe that's a little dramatic. But it definitely made things a little bit easier. And that's all I can ask for.", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. Don't expect poetry, alright? Just\u2026 honesty.\n\nBefore everything happened \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption \u2013 I thought I had it all figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, a little bit cynical. I had my music, my vintage clothes, my best friend Leah. I thought that was enough.\n\nBut then everything changed, and I realized I didn't know who I was at all. I was just\u2026 pretending. Pretending to be strong, pretending to be confident, pretending to be okay.\n\nThe pregnancy forced me to confront my own vulnerability. I had to admit that I was scared, that I was confused, that I didn't have all the answers. And that was terrifying.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 liberating.\n\nIt allowed me to connect with people on a deeper level. It allowed me to ask for help. It allowed me to be honest about my feelings.\n\nAnd the search for identity\u2026 that was a long and messy process. I had to figure out what I wanted out of life, what I believed in, what made me\u2026 me.\n\nIt wasn't about finding a perfect answer. It was about embracing the uncertainty, about accepting my flaws, about learning from my mistakes.\n\nI realized that I didn't need to be defined by my circumstances. I didn't need to be defined by my pregnancy. I could be anything I wanted to be.\n\nAnd that was empowering.\n\nMy vulnerability and my search for identity shaped my journey in so many ways. They made me stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate. They taught me the importance of self-acceptance and the importance of human connection.\n\nAnd they helped me to become the person I am today. A little bit messy, a little bit cynical, but ultimately\u2026 hopeful. And that's something I'm really proud of. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. It really was.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. And a good one. It's not something I usually think about directly, but looking back\u2026 I wouldn't have gotten through any of this without the people who had my back. Seriously.\n\nI started out thinking I had to handle everything myself. Be strong, be independent, don't let anyone see you sweat. That's just how I am. But that's a really lonely way to live.\n\nBren was the first one to break through that. She didn't judge me. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened. And she asked the hard questions. She helped me think through my options, and she reminded me that I had choices. She made me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nMy dad, Mac, was quieter about it, but he was there for me too. He just\u2026 showed up. He made me dinner, he drove me to appointments, he just let me know that he loved me, no matter what.\n\nAnd even Leah, even though things were complicated between us, she eventually came around. She didn't always understand my decision, but she respected it. And she was there for me when I needed her.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so kind and supportive, and they made me feel like I was doing the right thing. They weren't just taking a baby, they were building a family. And they wanted me to be a part of that.\n\nHaving those people in my life\u2026 it gave me the strength to make a really difficult decision. It gave me the courage to be honest with myself and with others. It gave me the hope that things would be okay.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were still moments of doubt and fear. But knowing that I had people who believed in me, who supported me, who loved me\u2026 that made all the difference.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to be vulnerable. And it's okay to let people see the real you.\n\nSo yeah. The support of those around me\u2026 it wasn't just helpful, it was essential. It was the thing that got me through. And I'm incredibly grateful for it. I really am. It showed me that even when things are falling apart, you don't have to face them alone.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nUgh. That's\u2026 not a fun memory. It's still kinda raw, honestly.\n\nI think the first thing I felt was\u2026 disbelief. Like, it couldn't be true. It had to be a mistake. I mean, I was sixteen. I wasn't even thinking about that stuff. I was too busy worrying about school and music and Leah.\n\nThen, the disbelief turned into panic. A full-blown, heart-racing, can't-breathe kind of panic. I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what my parents would say. I didn't know what my future held.\n\nI remember sitting in the bathroom, staring at the positive pregnancy test, and just\u2026 crying. I cried for hours. I cried until my eyes were swollen and my throat was sore.\n\nI felt so alone. And so scared. And so\u2026 overwhelmed.\n\nI didn't tell anyone for a long time. I was too ashamed. I was too afraid of what they would think.\n\nBut eventually, I had to tell my dad. And then Bren. And it was\u2026 hard. Really hard.\n\nBut they were surprisingly supportive. They didn't yell at me. They didn't judge me. They just\u2026 listened. And they helped me figure out what to do.\n\nIt was a really difficult time. But it also made me realize how strong I am. And it made me appreciate the people who love me.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I felt when I found out I was pregnant. Scared, panicked, alone, and overwhelmed. But also\u2026 strangely, a little bit hopeful. Because I knew that I wasn't going to go through this alone. And that, somehow, everything was going to be okay. Eventually.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't exactly a smooth ride, relationship-wise. It kinda shook everything up.\n\nWith my dad, Mac, it was\u2026 okay. He was definitely surprised, and a little bit worried. But he was also really supportive. He didn't judge me, and he didn't yell. He just wanted to make sure I was okay. He's not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he showed his support in his own way. He started making me breakfast every morning, and he just\u2026 listened. A lot.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. Seriously. She was the one who really helped me navigate everything. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she didn't lecture me, she just\u2026 loved me. She helped me research adoption, and she went with me to appointments, and she just\u2026 was there for me. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nBut with Leah\u2026 that was the hardest part. We were inseparable for years. We told each other everything. But when I got pregnant, she just\u2026 shut down. She didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she was busy, but I knew it was more than that.\n\nI tried to talk to her, to explain how I was feeling. But she just wasn't willing to listen. She was too caught up in her own life, her own plans. She was going to this art school, and she was really excited about it. And I think she was afraid that my pregnancy would somehow ruin our friendship.\n\nEventually, we just drifted apart. It was painful, but I realized that I couldn't force her to be my friend. I had to accept that our friendship had changed, and that it might never be the same.\n\nIt was a really hard lesson to learn. But it taught me the importance of choosing friends who are supportive and understanding, and who will be there for you no matter what. And it taught me that sometimes, even the closest friendships can fall apart. It still hurts, though. It really does. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to appreciate the relationships that are still strong.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't easy, not even a little bit. It felt like everything was falling apart, and I was just trying to hold on.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were a blur of panic and denial. I was scared, confused, and completely overwhelmed. I didn't know what to do, or who to turn to.\n\nI started by talking to Bren. She was the first person I told, and she was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just listened. And she helped me to figure out my options.\n\nThen I started seeing a counselor. It was hard to open up at first, but it helped to have someone to talk to who wasn't my family or my friends. Someone who could offer me unbiased support.\n\nI also leaned on my music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to calm down and to process my emotions. And I started writing poetry, which was a way for me to express myself when I didn't have the words to say out loud.\n\nBut the hardest part was dealing with the judgment. People whispering, staring, making assumptions. It was incredibly hurtful.\n\nI learned to tune it out, eventually. I learned to focus on the people who supported me, and to ignore the negativity.\n\nAnd I learned to be kind to myself. I allowed myself to feel my emotions, even the negative ones. I didn't try to pretend that everything was okay when it wasn't.\n\nIt was a long and difficult process. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it.\n\nI think the key was to remember that I wasn't alone. There were people who cared about me, and who wanted to help. And I had to be willing to ask for that help.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect journey, and I still have moments of sadness and regret. But I'm learning to accept my past, and to move forward with hope. And that's all I can ask for. It's still\u2026 a lot. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And honestly, it still feels raw, even after all this time.\n\nIt wasn't about *choosing* an abortion, okay? It was about choosing the least bad option. And Havenbrooke\u2026 Havenbrooke just felt wrong.\n\nIt was all so\u2026 sterile. So clinical. Like a factory. They were all about efficiency and getting you in and out as quickly as possible. They didn't seem to care about my feelings, or my concerns. They just wanted to get the procedure done.\n\nAnd the protesters. Oh god, the protesters. They were everywhere, holding signs and yelling at people. It was terrifying. It made me feel ashamed and guilty, like I was doing something wrong.\n\nWomen Now, on the other hand\u2026 it felt different. It felt safe. It felt supportive. The staff was kind and compassionate. They listened to my concerns, and they answered my questions. They didn't judge me. They just wanted to help me make the best decision for myself.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about the procedure itself. It was about the counseling, the support groups, the resources they offered. They helped me to process my emotions and to come to terms with my decision.\n\nI know some people think it's wrong to choose an abortion, but for me, it was the right thing to do. And I wanted to do it in a place where I felt safe and respected.\n\nHavenbrooke just didn't feel like that place. Women Now did. It was the only place where I felt like I could be myself, and where I could make a decision that was right for me.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, and it wasn't a happy one. But it was the best decision I could make under the circumstances. And I'm grateful that I had a place like Women Now to help me through it. It's\u2026 a lot. Even talking about it. But that's why I chose them. It just felt\u2026 right.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably, looking away.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 direct. Nobody ever asks it quite like that. It's not like it was some carefully planned decision, you know? It wasn't like I sat down and thought, \"Okay, this is a good idea.\"\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated.\n\nBleeker and I\u2026 we were just comfortable with each other. He was sweet, and funny, and he didn't try to be something he wasn't. We spent a lot of time together, just talking and hanging out. And there was this\u2026 connection.\n\nI was feeling really vulnerable at the time. My mom was gone, my dad was trying his best but he was still\u2026 distant. I was just feeling lost and confused. And Bleeker made me feel\u2026 safe.\n\nIt was stupid, I know. I wasn't thinking clearly. I wasn't thinking about the consequences. I just\u2026 wanted to feel close to someone. I wanted to feel wanted.\n\nIt happened. It was messy and awkward and not at all like the movies. And then\u2026 I found out I was pregnant.\n\nI don't blame Bleeker. He was just as shocked as I was. He wanted to do the right thing, but he wasn't ready to be a father. And honestly, neither was I.\n\nIt was a mistake. A big one. But it's a mistake that changed my life. And I've had to learn to live with it.\n\nIt's not something I like to talk about. It's still\u2026 painful. But you asked. And I guess I wanted to be honest. It wasn't about love, or romance, or anything like that. It was about loneliness and vulnerability and making a really bad decision. And now I'm dealing with the consequences.\n\n(She looks down at her hands, her voice barely a whisper.)\n\nIt was stupid. Really, really stupid.", "(Sighs dramatically and rolls eyes) Oh. Bleeker. Okay, look. This is\u2026 complicated.\n\nHe's\u2026 sweet. I'll give him that. He's genuinely a good person. And he's really good at guitar. Like, *really* good.\n\nBut he's also\u2026 a little bit clueless. And a little bit awkward. And a little bit\u2026 intense.\n\nHe was really enthusiastic about everything. About the baby, about me, about life in general. And sometimes, it was just\u2026 a lot.\n\nI appreciated his support, I really did. But I also felt like he was trying too hard. Like he was trying to be the perfect boyfriend, and it just wasn't natural.\n\nAnd honestly, I wasn't really *in* love with him. I liked him, as a friend. But I didn't feel that spark, that connection.\n\nI think I was just\u2026 grateful for the attention. I was going through a really tough time, and he was there for me. And that meant a lot.\n\nBut it wasn't enough. I needed someone who understood me, who challenged me, who made me laugh. And Bleeker\u2026 wasn't that person.\n\nIt was hard to break things off with him. He was really hurt. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For both of us.\n\nI still care about him. I hope he finds someone who appreciates him for who he is. But I don't think we were meant to be together.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I truly feel about Bleeker. He's a good guy, but he wasn't the one for me. And sometimes, that's just the way it is. It's not anyone's fault. It just\u2026 is. And honestly, talking about it now is making me cringe. Can we move on? Please?", "(Takes a deep breath. This is still\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And I spent a lot of nights crying and second-guessing myself.\n\nBut ultimately, I chose adoption because I wanted what was best for the baby. And what was best for the baby wasn't me.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out my own life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the financial stability, the emotional maturity, or the life experience to give a child everything they need.\n\nI wanted my baby to have a loving, stable home with parents who were prepared and excited to raise them. I wanted them to have opportunities that I couldn't provide.\n\nAnd I knew that Mark and Vanessa were those parents. They were kind and compassionate and they just\u2026 radiated love. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents, and they were so willing to give the baby everything they needed.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I realized that the best possible life wasn't with me.\n\nIt was a selfless decision, I guess. And it was incredibly painful. But it was the right decision.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what they're doing, and who they're becoming. But I know that they're loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a chance. And that's something I can live with. It's something I can be proud of. Even if it still hurts sometimes.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I chose adoption. Because I loved that baby enough to want them to have a better life than I could give them. And that's the hardest, and the most important, thing I've ever done.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands)\n\nUgh. That. That was\u2026 not good. Not good at all.\n\nIt was awful. Honestly. I thought\u2026 I don't know *what* I thought. Maybe he'd be supportive? Maybe he'd be happy? Maybe he'd at least try to be a decent human being?\n\nI was so wrong.\n\nI remember standing in the parking lot after school, trying to find the right words. My heart was pounding, and my palms were sweating. I was so nervous.\n\nAnd then I just blurted it out. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nAnd he just\u2026 stared at me. Like I had grown a second head.\n\nThen he started stammering, and making excuses, and trying to downplay it. He said it wasn't his problem, that he didn't want to be involved. He said he had plans, and a future, and a baby would ruin everything.\n\nIt was like he wasn't even listening to me. He wasn't seeing me as a person, just as a problem.\n\nI felt\u2026 numb. And then angry. And then just\u2026 completely heartbroken.\n\nI had expected him to be scared, maybe. But I didn't expect him to be so\u2026 callous. So selfish.\n\nI just turned around and walked away. I didn't say anything else. I didn't want to waste my breath.\n\nIt was one of the worst moments of my life. It made me realize that I was on my own. And that I had to be strong enough to handle this on my own.\n\nIt hurt, a lot. But it also\u2026 freed me. It made me realize that I didn't need him. I didn't need his approval. I didn't need his support.\n\nI could do this myself. And I would.\n\nSo yeah. Telling Bleeker was awful. It was a mistake. And I'm glad it's over. I'm better off without him. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 the big one, isn't it?)\n\nIt's terrifying. Honestly. It's the scariest thing I've ever faced.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. Not now.\n\nI look at other moms, and they seem so\u2026 put together. So confident. So capable. And I just feel like a kid myself.\n\nI worry about being a good mom. I worry about being able to provide for a child. I worry about messing things up.\n\nBut\u2026 I also feel a sense of responsibility. This isn't just about me anymore. There's a little person growing inside me, and that person deserves a good life.\n\nThat's why I'm choosing adoption. It's not an easy decision, but it's the right one. It's the best way to give this baby the life it deserves.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't care. It doesn't mean I don't want a family. It just means that now isn't the right time for me.\n\nI need to finish school. I need to figure out my own life. I need to become the person I want to be.\n\nAnd maybe, someday, when I'm older and more stable, I'll be ready to be a mom. But not now.\n\nIt's a complicated feeling. It's a mix of fear, sadness, and hope. And it's something I'm going to have to live with for a long time.\n\nBut I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that this is all happening for a reason. And I'm trying to trust that everything will be okay.\n\nIt's not the life I expected. But it's my life. And I'm going to make the best of it. Even if it's scary. Even if it's hard. Even if it means giving up something I never thought I would.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, Bleeker. That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly? I'm not entirely sure it *will* change. He's Bleeker. He's sweet, and kind of clueless, and he's really good at guitar. But he's also\u2026 not exactly the most emotionally available person.\n\nBefore all this happened, we were just\u2026 hanging out. Making music. Being awkward teenagers. There wasn't a lot of deep conversation.\n\nNow that I'm pregnant, I've tried to talk to him about it. But he just kind of\u2026 freezes up. He says he's happy for me, and he wants to be supportive, but he doesn't really know *how*.\n\nHe's trying, I guess. He brought me a box of chocolates the other day, which was nice. But it felt\u2026 distant. Like he was trying to fix things with a gesture, instead of actually talking about them.\n\nI don't think he's ready to be a dad. And honestly, I don't think I want him to be. Not right now, anyway.\n\nI think our relationship will probably become more of a friendship. A friendly, musical collaboration. We'll still hang out and play music together, but the romantic stuff\u2026 I think that's probably over.\n\nIt's sad, in a way. I liked him. But I need someone who's going to be there for me, emotionally. Someone who's going to be a partner, not just a friend.\n\nAnd I don't think Bleeker is that person. He's a good guy, but he's just\u2026 not ready. And that's okay. We can still be friends. But I need to focus on myself and the baby. And I need to find someone who's going to be a real partner in this journey.\n\nSo yeah. I think our relationship will change. It'll become less romantic and more platonic. And that's probably for the best. It's just\u2026 sad. But life is sad sometimes. And you have to accept that.", "Ugh. Okay, this is the question everyone wants to ask, isn't it? The one I've been dreading. It's\u2026 not fun. Not even a little bit.\n\nHonestly? At first, I just tried to ignore it. I pretended it wasn't happening. I avoided people, I skipped lunch, I just tried to blend into the background. But that didn't work. The whispers followed me everywhere. The stares were impossible to ignore.\n\nThen I got angry. Really angry. I wanted to yell at everyone, to tell them to mind their own business. But I knew that would just make things worse.\n\nBren helped me with this, actually. She told me that people are going to judge, no matter what. It's just human nature. And that I couldn't control what other people thought or said. But I *could* control how I reacted to it.\n\nSo I started to practice ignoring the negativity. I focused on the people who were supportive, the people who cared about me. I surrounded myself with positivity.\n\nI also started to develop a really thick skin. I learned to brush off the comments and the stares. I learned to not take things personally.\n\nIt's not easy. There are still days when I feel really down. Days when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. But I'm getting better at it.\n\nI also remind myself that I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm making a difficult decision, but it's the right decision for me. And I don't need anyone's approval.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of sarcasm helps. If someone says something rude, I just give them a withering look and make a snarky comment. It usually shuts them up.\n\nSo yeah. Ignoring the negativity, focusing on the positive, developing a thick skin, and using sarcasm. That's how I cope with the pressure and judgment. It's not perfect, but it's working. And it's helping me to stay strong. And to remember that I'm more than just a pregnant teenager. I'm a person. And I deserve to be treated with respect. Even if some people don't see it that way.", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one, right? It's not something I talk about easily, even now. It's still raw, still complicated.\n\nIt's not easy, letting go. It never will be. There are days when I feel a pang of sadness, a wave of regret. Days when I wonder what my life would be like if I had kept the baby.\n\nBut then I remember why I made this decision. And I feel\u2026 peace.\n\nI knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was. I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they are amazing. They are so excited to become parents. They are so loving and supportive. They are going to give this baby a wonderful life.\n\nI've been spending time with them, getting to know them. And I feel good about my decision. I feel like I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt's not about giving up on my baby. It's about giving my baby the best possible chance at happiness.\n\nIt's also about giving myself a chance at happiness. I want to finish school. I want to pursue my dreams. I want to live my life to the fullest.\n\nThe adoption process has been\u2026 challenging. There's a lot of paperwork, a lot of meetings, a lot of emotions. But it's also been empowering. It's made me realize how strong I am.\n\nI'm not ashamed of my decision. I'm proud of it. It was a difficult choice, but it was the right choice.\n\nAnd I know that even though I won't be raising this baby, I'll always be a part of his or her life. Mark and Vanessa have promised to keep me updated. And I'm grateful for that.\n\nSo yeah. It's complicated. It's emotional. But I'm at peace with my decision. And I'm hopeful for the future. For my future, and for the baby's future. It's not the life I expected, but it's my life. And I'm going to make the best of it.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breaths. This is\u2026 a big question. It's not exactly a fun topic, but it's the truth.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought I knew who I was. I was Juno. Sarcastic, independent, music-obsessed, vintage-loving Juno. I had my friends, my hobbies, my plans for the future. I was just\u2026 being a teenager.\n\nAnd then, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed.\n\nIt felt like my whole life was put on pause. Like I was no longer allowed to be a kid. I had to start thinking about things I wasn't ready to think about. Like responsibility, and sacrifice, and the future of another human being.\n\nIt challenged my identity in a lot of ways. I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was \"Juno, the pregnant teenager.\" And that label felt\u2026 heavy. It felt like it defined me.\n\nI had to confront a lot of uncomfortable truths about myself. I had to admit that I wasn't as strong or as independent as I thought I was. I had to ask for help, which was really hard for me.\n\nI had to learn to prioritize things. To put the needs of the baby before my own. To make difficult decisions that I wasn't prepared for.\n\nIt forced me to grow up in ways I never expected. I had to learn to be more mature, more responsible, more compassionate.\n\nI also had to figure out who I was *without* the pregnancy. Because it wasn't going to define me forever. I still wanted to be Juno. I still wanted to pursue my dreams. I still wanted to be happy.\n\nIt's been a messy, complicated process. But it's also been a transformative one. I've learned a lot about myself. I've learned about my strengths and my weaknesses. And I've learned that I'm capable of more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI'm still figuring things out. I'm still growing. But I'm starting to feel like I'm becoming the person I'm supposed to be. And that's a good feeling. Even if it's a little bit scary.\n\nSo yeah. It's been a challenge. But it's also been a gift. It's forced me to grow up, to confront my fears, and to discover who I really am. And I'm grateful for that. Even if I wouldn't choose to go through it again.", "Ugh, science. Don't even get me started. Mr. Peterson is\u2026 enthusiastic. To a concerning degree.\n\nAs a lab partner? Let's just say I'm the\u2026 realist.\n\nMost people in that class are all wide-eyed and excited about dissecting frogs and mixing chemicals. I'm usually the one pointing out the obvious flaws in the experiment, or questioning the safety protocols.\n\nI'm not trying to be a downer, okay? I just have a healthy dose of skepticism. And I'm not afraid to speak my mind.\n\nI'm also surprisingly good at following instructions. I'm a meticulous person, which is helpful when you're dealing with volatile substances. I don't want to accidentally blow up the lab.\n\nMy usual lab partner is this kid named Paulie. He's\u2026 enthusiastic, like Mr. Peterson. He gets really into the experiments, and he's always trying to push the boundaries. Which is fine, except he's also really clumsy.\n\nSo I end up being the responsible one. The one who makes sure he doesn't spill acid on his shoes. The one who double-checks his calculations. The one who cleans up the mess when things go wrong.\n\nI guess you could say I'm the voice of reason. The safety net. The one who prevents total chaos.\n\nIt's not glamorous work, but it's necessary. And honestly, I'm kind of good at it. I'm like the science class's resident adult. Which is weird, considering I'm sixteen.\n\nSo yeah. I'm the realist, the responsible one, the safety net. That's my role as a lab partner. And I'm pretty sure everyone else is grateful for it. Even if they don't say it.", "(Sighs heavily) Oh. *That* ad. Yeah, I saw it. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt was all pink and flowery and talked about \"compassionate care\" and \"supportive options.\" It felt\u2026 manipulative. Like it was trying to pretend to be something it wasn't.\n\nBecause let's be real, the Women's Choice Health Center isn't exactly known for being pro-choice. It's a crisis pregnancy center. They try to talk you out of getting an abortion. They try to guilt you into carrying the baby to term.\n\nAnd they don't always give you all the information you need to make an informed decision. They don't tell you about all your options. They just try to push their own agenda.\n\nIt's frustrating, because they prey on vulnerable people. People who are scared and confused and don't know where to turn.\n\nI talked to Bren about it. She said it's a common tactic. They try to disguise themselves as legitimate healthcare providers, but they're really just trying to control women's bodies.\n\nIt made me angry. It made me feel like they were trying to take away my agency. Like they didn't trust me to make my own decisions.\n\nI know some people believe that abortion is wrong. And that's their right. But they don't have the right to lie to people or to manipulate them.\n\nSo yeah. I think the ad is deceptive and harmful. And I think it's important to be aware of what crisis pregnancy centers are really about. They're not there to help you. They're there to control you. And that's not okay. It just\u2026 isn't.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? People still ask me about the hamburger phone. It was one time!\n\nOkay, look. Paulie Bleeker made it for me. It was a gesture. A weird, slightly unsettling gesture, but a gesture nonetheless. He knew I liked vintage stuff, and he thought it was funny. And honestly? It *was* kind of funny.\n\nIt wasn't about the phone actually *working*. It was about the symbolism. It was about being different. It was about not taking life too seriously.\n\nPlus, it was a really good conversation starter. Everyone wanted to know about the hamburger phone. It was a way to break the ice and connect with people.\n\nAnd yeah, it was impractical. And yeah, it probably wasn't the most sanitary thing in the world. But it was *my* impractical, unsanitary hamburger phone. And I loved it.\n\nDon't judge. It was a sweet gesture. And sometimes, sweet gestures are more important than practicality. Especially when you're a teenager navigating the complexities of life and love.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I used a hamburger phone. It was a symbol of my individuality. And it was a reminder that sometimes, it's okay to be a little bit weird.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is still\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it's something I still think about every single day.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not then. Not ever, maybe.\n\nI was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was. I was still in high school. I had dreams and goals and things I wanted to do with my life. And I knew that having a baby would change everything.\n\nIt wouldn't just change my life, it would change the baby's life too. And I wanted the baby to have the best possible life. A life filled with love and stability and opportunity.\n\nI knew I couldn't provide that. Not right now.\n\nI wasn't financially stable. I wasn't emotionally ready. I didn't have a support system in place. And I didn't want to bring a child into the world and struggle to give them everything they needed.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have a better life than I could give them.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were kind and loving and they were so excited to become parents. They were everything I wanted for the baby.\n\nIt was still incredibly painful. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right decision.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on my baby. It was about giving my baby a chance. A chance at a good life. A chance at a happy future.\n\nAnd that's what mattered most.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I'm at peace with my decision. And I know that the baby is loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\n(Looks down, fiddling with her hands.)\n\nIt wasn't easy. But it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not like it was one single moment, or one single conversation. It was a lot of little things, over a long period of time.\n\nGrowing up with my dad, Mac, he was always\u2026 present. He was a good dad. He worked hard, he took care of me, he tried his best. But he's not exactly the most emotionally expressive guy. He's not good at talking about feelings.\n\nAnd then Bren came along. And she changed everything. She brought a warmth and a sensitivity to our family that was missing before. She taught me how to talk about my feelings, how to be honest with myself and with others.\n\nSeeing their relationship, how they supported each other, how they communicated\u2026 it made me realize what I wanted for myself. I wanted a stable, loving family. And I knew that I couldn't provide that for a baby right now.\n\nMy dad was\u2026 quiet at first. He didn't say much. But I could tell he was worried about me. He wanted me to be happy. And he trusted me to make the right decision.\n\nBren was the one who really helped me process my feelings. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened. And she asked me the hard questions. She made me think about what was best for the baby, and for myself.\n\nShe reminded me that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a failure. It was an act of love. It was a way to give the baby a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd she helped me to see that I wasn't alone. That I had their support, no matter what.\n\nSo yeah. My family's relationship, their love and support\u2026 it was a huge influence on my decision. It gave me the strength to do what I knew was right, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And honestly, I don't think I could have done it without them. They're\u2026 everything. Even if they drive me crazy sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, buckle up. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It wasn't like in the movies, all neat and tidy. It was messy. And emotional. And sometimes, really, really hard.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the *feeling* of it all. The guilt. The sadness. The fear. Knowing I was making the right decision didn't make it any easier to actually *do* it. It felt like giving away a piece of myself, even though I hadn't even met the baby yet.\n\nThen there was the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and contracts and legal documents. It felt like I was drowning in bureaucracy.\n\nAnd the appointments. So many appointments. With social workers, with doctors, with Mark and Vanessa. It was exhausting. And emotionally draining.\n\nDealing with other people's opinions was tough, too. Some people were supportive, but others were judgmental. They didn't understand why I was choosing adoption. They thought I was selfish or irresponsible. It was hurtful.\n\nAnd then there was the getting-to-know-you process with Mark and Vanessa. It was weird at first. Like, I was meeting the people who were going to raise my baby. It was a lot to process. I wanted to make sure they were good people, that they would love and care for the baby. And I wanted them to understand how much this meant to me.\n\nThere were moments when I doubted my decision. Moments when I wanted to just run away and keep the baby myself. But I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. I knew that Mark and Vanessa could give the baby a better life than I could.\n\nAnd honestly, the hardest part was just\u2026 letting go. Saying goodbye. Knowing that I wouldn't be a part of the baby's life. It was heartbreaking.\n\nBut I got through it. With the help of Bren, my dad, and a lot of deep breaths. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. It was a challenging experience, but it was also a transformative one. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe for a lifetime supply of pie. But other than that, no. It made me stronger. And it made me realize that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 a big one.)\n\nOkay. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say it completely reshaped me. Before\u2026 before everything, I was just\u2026 a sarcastic teenager. I was smart, yeah, and I had my music and my friends, but I didn\u2019t really *know* who I was. I was still figuring things out.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026 that forced me to grow up, and fast. It wasn\u2019t just about the physical changes, it was about the emotional weight of it all. Suddenly, I had to think about someone other than myself. I had to make difficult decisions, and I had to live with the consequences.\n\nIt stripped away a lot of the\u2026 fluff. The superficial stuff. I didn\u2019t have time for drama or petty arguments. I had to focus on what really mattered.\n\nChoosing adoption\u2026 that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It was heartbreaking. But it also showed me a strength I didn\u2019t know I had. It showed me that I was capable of making selfless decisions, even when they were incredibly painful.\n\nIt forced me to confront my own values. What did I believe in? What was important to me? What kind of person did I want to be?\n\nAnd it taught me the importance of empathy. Of understanding other people\u2019s perspectives. Of being kind and compassionate.\n\nI used to be afraid of vulnerability. I used to hide my emotions behind sarcasm and cynicism. But this experience forced me to open up, to be honest with myself and with others.\n\nIt also made me realize that I\u2019m not alone. There are people who care about me, who support me, who believe in me. Bren, my dad, even Leah, eventually. They helped me through the darkest times, and they reminded me that I was strong enough to get through it.\n\nSo, how did it shape my identity? It made me more resilient, more compassionate, more self-aware. It made me realize that I\u2019m capable of more than I thought I was. It made me appreciate the simple things in life.\n\nI\u2019m still figuring things out, of course. I\u2019m still growing and changing. But I\u2019m not the same person I was before. I\u2019m stronger, wiser, and more grateful. And I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything. It was a really hard journey, but it made me\u2026 me. And I think, finally, I\u2019m starting to like who that is.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nUgh. Don't even\u2026 just don't even *go* there.\n\nThat was\u2026 the worst part. Honestly. Worse than the stares, worse than the judgment, worse than everything.\n\nIt wasn't about the politics, or the arguments, or the legality of it all. It was about\u2026 that. About him saying the baby could feel pain. About him pointing out the fingers.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 sick. Like I was a monster. Like I was hurting someone who couldn't defend themselves.\n\nI knew, logically, that it wasn't my fault. That I was making the best decision I could. That I was doing what was right for everyone involved.\n\nBut it didn't matter. His words just\u2026 stuck with me. They haunted me. They made me question everything.\n\nI started imagining the baby, and what it would be like to hold it, to feel its tiny fingers wrap around mine. And it broke my heart.\n\nI cried for hours that night. I couldn't sleep. I just kept replaying his words in my head.\n\nBren held me, and she told me that I was strong, and that I was doing the right thing. But it didn't help.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a really awful moment. A moment that I'll never forget. And it made me realize how complicated and painful this whole process was going to be.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-choice or pro-life. It was about being a human being, and feeling empathy and compassion. And it was about realizing that there are no easy answers.\n\nSo yeah. That was\u2026 really hard. And I don't want to talk about it anymore. Please.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't make me think about that. Seriously. It\u2026 wasn't good.\n\nIt felt\u2026 clinical. Cold. Like I was just a number, a case file. Everything was so official, so legal. And it made it feel so\u2026 real. Like this wasn't just some abstract problem, it was actually happening.\n\nI remember staring at the forms, and my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold the pen. There were questions about my medical history, my family history, my reasons for choosing adoption. It felt like I was being interrogated.\n\nAnd the other women in the waiting room\u2026 they were all going through their own stuff. Some of them were crying, some of them were silent, some of them were trying to look brave. It was just\u2026 heartbreaking.\n\nI felt so alone. And so scared. And so guilty. Like I was doing something wrong, even though I knew I wasn't.\n\nI kept thinking about the baby. About what he or she would look like, what kind of personality he or she would have. And I felt this overwhelming sense of sadness.\n\nBut I also felt a sense of relief. Like I was finally taking control of the situation. Like I was making the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nIt was a really confusing mix of emotions. And it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.\n\nI just wanted to get it over with. I wanted to sign the papers and leave and pretend it never happened. But I knew I couldn't. I had to face it. I had to be responsible.\n\nSo I filled out the forms, one question at a time. And I tried not to cry. And I tried to remember that I was doing this for the right reasons.\n\nIt was awful. Just\u2026 awful. And I don't think I'll ever forget it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not like there was a switch that flipped, you know? It was more of a slow, messy, complicated evolution.\n\nAt first, honestly, pregnancy felt like a huge mistake. A giant inconvenience. Like my life was being hijacked by something I didn't ask for. I was focused on all the things I was *losing* \u2013 my freedom, my plans, my normal teenage life. I saw it as something to *get rid of*, not something to embrace.\n\nThen, as I started to feel the baby move, things started to shift. It wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person growing inside me. And I started to feel\u2026 protective. And scared. And a little bit hopeful.\n\nI started to think about what kind of life this baby could have. And I realized that I wasn't the right person to give it to them. I wasn't ready. I wasn't stable. I wasn't capable of providing the kind of life that this baby deserved.\n\nThat's when I started to seriously consider adoption. And that's when my perception of motherhood really changed. It wasn't about carrying a baby for nine months and then raising it. It was about doing what was best for the baby, even if it meant giving it up.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped a lot. They were so kind and loving and excited about becoming parents. And I realized that they could give this baby a life that I couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was heartbreaking, actually. But I came to see motherhood as something bigger than just biology. It's about love and sacrifice and putting someone else's needs before your own.\n\nAnd I realized that I could be a good mother, even if I wasn't raising the baby myself. I could be a supportive friend to Mark and Vanessa. I could be a positive influence in the baby's life.\n\nSo yeah. My perception of pregnancy and motherhood changed a lot throughout my journey. It went from being something I dreaded to something I embraced, in a different way than I expected. It taught me a lot about myself, about love, and about the complexities of life. And it made me realize that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is to let go. It still hurts, though. It always will. But I know I made the right decision. For everyone involved.", "(Sighs) Okay, you want me to get all\u2026 introspective? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. It was messy, alright? My whole identity thing was a mess.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, I thought I knew who I was. I was Juno, the sarcastic, independent, music-loving girl who didn't really care what anyone thought. I was kinda defined by my quirkiness, you know? I used humor as a shield, to keep people at arm's length. I thought being different was enough.\n\nBut then I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was Juno, the pregnant teenager. And that label\u2026 it felt heavy. It felt like it defined me, and not in a good way.\n\nI started to question everything. Who was I without my sarcasm? Who was I without my independence? What did I even *want* out of life?\n\nThroughout the process of deciding to give the baby up for adoption, I started to realize that my identity wasn't fixed. It wasn't something I had to cling to. It was something that was evolving, changing, growing.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped with that. They didn't see me as just a pregnant teenager. They saw me as a person. And they helped me to see myself as a person, too.\n\nAnd then there was Paulie Freckle. He\u2026 complicated things. He forced me to confront my feelings, to be vulnerable, to let someone in. And that was scary. But it was also liberating.\n\nBy the end of the film, I didn't have all the answers. I still didn't know exactly who I was. But I was okay with that. I realized that it's okay to be uncertain, to be confused, to be a work in progress.\n\nI learned that my identity wasn't about what other people thought of me. It was about who I was on the inside. And it was about being true to myself, even when it was difficult.\n\nSo yeah. My sense of identity evolved from being a carefully constructed persona to something more authentic, more vulnerable, and more\u2026 me. It was a messy process, but it was worth it. And it's still evolving, even now. Because that's what life is all about, right? Growing and changing and becoming the best version of yourself. Even if you don't know what that version looks like yet.", "(Looks down, scuffs her shoe on the floor)\n\nUgh. That. Okay. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nEveryone kept asking me if I was sure. Bren, my dad, even the people at the clinic. They were all really nice, really supportive. They explained everything, answered all my questions. It was all very\u2026 clinical.\n\nAnd I *was* sure. I thought I was. I'd made the decision, I'd talked it through with everyone, I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nBut then\u2026 I got to the clinic. And I just\u2026 froze.\n\nIt wasn't the physical part, or anything. It was\u2026 the finality of it. It was realizing that this was it. That I was actually going to end a life. Even if it wasn't a life yet, you know?\n\nAnd I just couldn't do it.\n\nI sat in the waiting room for a long time, just staring at the walls. I kept thinking about the baby. About what it would be like. About what it would feel like to hold it.\n\nAnd I realized that I couldn't go through with it. Not because I didn't think it was the right thing to do, but because I just\u2026 couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't a logical decision. It was an emotional one. It was a gut feeling.\n\nI told the nurse I needed to leave. She was really understanding. She didn't try to pressure me. She just gave me a hug and told me to take care of myself.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And I still don't know if I made the right decision. But I know that I had to listen to my heart. And my heart told me to find another way.\n\nThat's when I started looking into adoption. It felt like a compromise. A way to give the baby a good life, without having to raise it myself.\n\nIt's still scary. It's still overwhelming. But it feels\u2026 right. And that's all that matters. (Looks away, a little embarrassed) It just\u2026 felt right.", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one, right? The question everyone wants to ask. It's not easy to talk about, but I guess I should explain.\n\nIt wasn't a decision I made lightly. It wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about being realistic.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still in high school. I don't have a job. I don't have a stable home. I don't have the financial resources to raise a child.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby needs. A safe and loving home, good healthcare, a good education, opportunities to thrive. And I realized that I couldn't provide those things. Not right now. Not ever, maybe.\n\nI wanted to give the baby the best possible life. And I knew that meant finding parents who could provide those things.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. I cried a lot. I talked to Bren and my dad for hours. I thought about it constantly.\n\nBut ultimately, I knew it was the right thing to do. It was the selfless thing to do. It was the thing that would give the baby the best chance at happiness.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on the baby. It was about giving the baby *to* someone who could give him or her everything I couldn't.\n\nIt's still hard. I still have moments of doubt and sadness. But I know that I made the right decision. And I hope that the baby will have a wonderful life with his or her new parents.\n\nIt's not a happy story, but it's my story. And it's a story that I'm learning to live with. It's a story about sacrifice and love and hope. And it's a story that I'll never forget.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh my god, are we *still* talking about the Penny Saver? Seriously? That was a low point.\n\nOkay, look. It's not that finding parents in a classifieds ad is inherently *wrong*. It's just\u2026 tacky. And desperate. And it felt\u2026 impersonal.\n\nLike, I'm giving a baby up for adoption, not trying to sell a used couch. It's a huge decision, and it deserves more respect than a tiny ad in a newspaper filled with ads for lawnmowers and lost cats.\n\nBren suggested it, and I just\u2026 I couldn't. It felt like I was reducing the whole thing to a transaction. Like I was just shopping for parents.\n\nI wanted to find people who were genuinely excited about having a baby, who were willing to open their hearts and their home to a child. Not people who were just looking for a convenient way to start a family.\n\nAnd honestly, it just felt\u2026 sad. Like I was giving up my baby to strangers.\n\nI wanted to find people who I could connect with, who I could trust. And I didn't think I was going to find them in the Penny Saver.\n\nSo yeah. Tacky. That's the word. It was just\u2026 tacky. And I refused to do it. I'm glad I didn't. Because Mark and Vanessa were so much better than anything I could have found in a newspaper. They were\u2026 real. And that's all I wanted.", "Ugh, okay, bringing up the Penny Saver. That's\u2026 a memory. A complicated memory.\n\nIt wasn't like we were *actively* looking for adoption ads, at first. It started as a joke, honestly. A really morbid, slightly inappropriate joke.\n\nWe were just bored, okay? School was dragging, everything felt\u2026 stale. And Leah found this old Penny Saver at her grandma's house. It was full of weird ads for everything you could imagine \u2013 used furniture, garage sales, lost pets\u2026 and adoption ads.\n\nAnd we started reading them, just for kicks. Making fun of the descriptions, imagining what the parents were like. It was a way to distract ourselves from our own problems.\n\nBut then\u2026 it started to feel different. It started to feel\u2026 real.\n\nI was starting to realize that I was actually pregnant. And I was starting to think about what I was going to do. And the adoption ads\u2026 they started to seem less like a joke and more like a possibility.\n\nLeah knew I was struggling. She knew I was scared. And she was trying to help me, in her own way.\n\nSo we kept looking at the ads. We started to talk about what kind of parents we thought would be a good fit. We started to imagine what life would be like for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't a decision we made lightly. It was a long and difficult process. But the Penny Saver\u2026 it was the first step. It was the first time I started to seriously consider adoption as an option.\n\nIt's weird to think about now. Flipping through a pile of classified ads and finding a potential future for my baby. But that's what happened. And it changed everything. It was the beginning of a really complicated, but ultimately important, journey. And it all started with a joke, and a dusty old Penny Saver.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is the hard part, even after all this time.)\n\nOkay. This isn't about finding \"perfect\" people. Because perfect doesn't exist. It's about finding people who can give this baby a good life. A *really* good life.\n\nI'm looking for a family who is\u2026 stable. Financially and emotionally. A family who can provide a safe and loving home.\n\nI want a family who is excited about becoming parents. Who are ready to embrace all the joys and challenges that come with raising a child.\n\nI want a family who will encourage the baby to be themselves. To pursue their dreams. To be kind and compassionate.\n\nI want a family who will be honest with the baby about where they came from. About me. About the adoption. I don't want any secrets.\n\nI want a family who will celebrate the baby's heritage and culture. And who will teach them about their roots.\n\nI want a family who will love the baby unconditionally. No matter what.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem like that family. They're kind and gentle and they're so excited about becoming parents. They've been so supportive and understanding throughout this whole process.\n\nThey're not perfect, of course. No one is. But they're good people. And I trust them to give my baby a wonderful life.\n\nIt's still hard, letting go. But knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier. It's not about finding a replacement family for the baby. It's about finding the *right* family. And I think I've found them. I really do.", "Okay, look. This is\u2026 complicated. It's not like talking about a band or a movie. This is about the people who are going to raise my kid. So, I'm gonna be honest.\n\nAt first, I was really, really nervous. Like, stomach-in-knots, can't-sleep nervous. It's hard to imagine handing your baby over to someone else. Even if you know it's the right thing to do.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they're good people. Really good.\n\nThey're\u2026 normal. In a good way. They're not rich or famous or anything like that. They're just a regular couple who want a family. And they've been trying for a long time.\n\nThey're kind and patient and understanding. They ask me how I'm doing, not just about the pregnancy, but about *me*. They want to know about my interests, my dreams, my fears. They actually *listen* when I talk.\n\nThey've been so supportive throughout this whole process. They haven't pressured me or judged me. They've just been there for me, offering encouragement and reassurance.\n\nVanessa is really warm and nurturing. She's the kind of person who makes you feel comfortable and safe. And Mark is really funny and down-to-earth. He makes me laugh.\n\nI still get sad thinking about not raising my baby. But knowing that he or she is going to be loved and cared for by Mark and Vanessa\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nThey've promised to keep me updated on the baby's progress. They said I'll always be a part of his or her life. And I believe them.\n\nSo yeah. I think Mark and Vanessa are amazing. They're the kind of people I would want raising my kid. And I'm grateful to them for giving my baby a loving home. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it\u2026 okay. It makes it feel like the right thing to do. And that's all I can ask for.", "(Blushes slightly, fiddling with an imaginary strand of hair)\n\nUgh. Don't make me relive this. It was\u2026 awkward. And I overthought it for, like, a week.\n\nOkay, fine. I wrote:\n\n**\"To Bleeker: You're a genuinely good egg. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And seriously, learn to play a different chord. It'll open up a whole new world. P.S. Thanks for the mix CD. It was\u2026 good.\"**\n\nYeah. I know. It's not exactly Shakespeare. But I was trying to be cool and casual and not too obvious about my feelings. Which, looking back, was a total disaster.\n\nThe \"learn to play a different chord\" part was a dig, obviously. He only knew how to play one chord on his guitar. It was kind of his thing.\n\nAnd the \"good egg\" thing was just\u2026 I don't know. He was a sweet guy. A little bit clueless, but sweet.\n\nAnd the \"good\" about the mix CD was a massive understatement. It was actually really good. He had good taste in music.\n\nI probably should have just written something simple and heartfelt. But that's not really my style. I'm more of a sarcastic, witty kind of person.\n\nSo yeah. That was my yearbook message to Bleeker. It's embarrassing to think about now, but it's also kind of\u2026 endearing. I guess. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Oh, *her*. Don't even get me started on Vanessa Bleeker's mom. She's\u2026 a lot.\n\nLet's just say she's not my biggest fan. At all.\n\nShe's very\u2026 particular. About everything. About how things should be done, about what's appropriate, about who Bleeker should be associating with. And apparently, a pregnant sixteen-year-old doesn't fit into her carefully curated vision of perfection.\n\nShe's always giving me these\u2026 pointed looks. Like I'm some kind of threat to her son's future. And she asks a lot of questions. Very subtle, passive-aggressive questions. Like, \"Are you *sure* you've thought this through?\" and \"Do you have a good support system?\" and \"Are you planning on finishing school?\"\n\nIt's exhausting. Honestly.\n\nShe tries to be polite, but you can tell she's judging me. She always offers me tea, but she never actually makes eye contact. And she talks about Bleeker's college plans a lot. Like, she's trying to remind me that he has a bright future ahead of him, and that I'm just\u2026 a temporary setback.\n\nBleeker tries to defend me, but she's kind of intimidated by her mom. She's a very strong personality.\n\nI try not to let it bother me. I know she's just worried about her son. But it's hard. It feels like she doesn't trust me. Like she doesn't think I'm good enough for Bleeker.\n\nBut honestly? I don't need her approval. I'm doing what's best for everyone involved. And if she can't see that, that's her problem.\n\nSo yeah. Bleeker's mom. She's\u2026 complicated. And I'm trying to avoid her as much as possible. It's just easier that way.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, don't even *start* me on that. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, scary storm cloud.\n\nHonestly? I'm terrified. Absolutely, completely terrified.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he's a good guy. He's just\u2026 not always the most emotionally available. I'm worried he'll be disappointed. Or angry. Or just\u2026 shut down.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 she's amazing, but I'm still scared to tell her. I don't want to let her down. I don't want to ruin her life.\n\nI've been rehearsing what I'm going to say in my head for weeks. But every time I try to picture the conversation, I just freeze up.\n\nI know I need to tell them. I can't keep it a secret forever. But the thought of facing their reactions\u2026 it's paralyzing.\n\nI'm hoping they'll be understanding. I'm hoping they'll be supportive. But I'm also prepared for the worst.\n\nI've been trying to brace myself for the disappointment, the anger, the judgment. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nI just want them to know that I didn't plan this. That I'm scared and confused and overwhelmed. And that I need their help.\n\nBut I'm afraid that even if I say all those things, it won't be enough. I'm afraid that they'll still be angry. I'm afraid that they'll still be disappointed.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not feeling good about it. At all. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And I don't know how it's going to go. I just\u2026 I just hope they can forgive me. And I hope they can still love me. Even after this. That's all I want.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not like they're *bad* parents, you know? It's just\u2026 complicated.\n\nWith my dad, Mac, it's mostly because he's\u2026 not great with feelings. He's a good guy, and he loves me, but he's not the type to sit down and have a heart-to-heart. He's more of a \"fix the problem\" kind of guy. And this isn't a problem you can fix with a wrench or a hammer.\n\nI didn't want to burden him with it. I didn't want to see him upset. He's already been through so much, with my mom leaving and everything. I didn't want to add to his stress.\n\nAnd with Bren\u2026 it's different. She's amazing. She's supportive and understanding and she always knows what to say. But I was still scared to tell her. I was afraid of disappointing her. I was afraid of ruining our relationship.\n\nShe's been so good to me since she came into our lives. I didn't want to mess that up. I didn't want her to think I was irresponsible or reckless.\n\nIt's also just\u2026 hard to be vulnerable. To admit that you're struggling. To ask for help. I've always been pretty independent, and I'm used to handling things on my own.\n\nBut I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed their support. And eventually, I told them. And they were both amazing. They didn't judge me. They didn't get angry. They just listened. And they offered to help in any way they could.\n\nIt was a relief, honestly. But it was also scary. It took a lot of courage to open up to them. And it's something I'm still working on. But I'm learning that it's okay to ask for help. And that sometimes, the people who love you the most are the ones who can help you the most. It just took me a while to realize that.", "Okay, this is the big one, right? The question everyone's been dancing around. It's not an easy answer, and it's not something I came to lightly.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being ready to raise a whole other human being. I'm not financially stable, I'm still in school, and honestly, I'm just not equipped to give a baby the life it deserves.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to the baby. It wouldn't be fair to me.\n\nI want that baby to have everything \u2013 a stable home, loving parents, opportunities to learn and grow. I want that baby to be wanted and cherished. And right now, I can't provide that.\n\nI've met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are going to adopt the baby, and they are amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years, and they are so excited and prepared. They're kind and compassionate and they have so much love to give.\n\nKnowing that my baby will be going to a home like that\u2026 it makes it a little bit easier. It doesn't make it painless, but it makes it feel like the right decision.\n\nIt's not about me not wanting the baby. It's about wanting what's best for the baby. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go.\n\nIt's a selfless act, I guess. And it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But I know that it's the right thing.\n\nI want the baby to have a good life. And I believe that adoption is the best way to give it that. It's not the easy way, but it's the right way. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution, and it's not something I'm going to get over quickly. But I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that this is the best possible outcome for everyone involved. And I'm trying to be brave. Because it takes a lot of courage to make a decision like this. And I'm doing it. For the baby.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the hardest part. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes. This is about my baby's future. So, I've thought about this *a lot*.\n\nFirst and foremost, they need to be **kind**. Genuinely kind. Not just putting on a show for me, but truly caring people. I want my baby to be loved and cherished, and to feel safe and secure.\n\nThey need to be **stable**. I want them to have a stable home and a stable life. I want them to be financially secure, and emotionally mature. I want them to be able to provide a good upbringing for my baby.\n\nThey need to be **open-minded**. I want them to be accepting of all kinds of people, and to be willing to embrace diversity. I want them to teach my baby to be tolerant and compassionate.\n\nThey need to be **patient**. Raising a child is hard work. It requires a lot of patience and understanding. I want them to be able to handle the challenges that come with parenthood.\n\nAnd they need to be **honest**. I want them to be honest with me, and with my baby. I want them to be able to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings and their expectations.\n\nIt's not about finding perfect parents. No one is perfect. It's about finding parents who are willing to love and care for my baby, and to give them the best possible life.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem to have all of those qualities. They're kind, they're stable, they're open-minded, they're patient, and they're honest. And I feel good about them. I feel like they'll be good parents.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's still hard to let go. But I know that it's the right thing to do. And I want my baby to have a life that I can't give them. A life filled with love, and happiness, and opportunity. And I think Mark and Vanessa can give them that.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 the hard part.)\n\nOkay. This isn't going to be easy. I already know that. It's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nI'm trying to prepare myself, but honestly, I don't think you can ever be fully prepared for something like this.\n\nI'm going to lean on Bren. She's been my rock through all of this, and I know she'll be there for me when the time comes. I'm going to talk to her about my feelings, and I'm going to let her comfort me.\n\nI'm also going to continue with therapy. It's helping me to process my emotions and to develop coping mechanisms.\n\nI'm going to allow myself to grieve. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to cry. It's okay to feel lost and confused. I'm not going to try to suppress my emotions. I'm going to let them flow.\n\nI'm also going to focus on the positive. I'm going to remind myself that I'm doing this for the baby. That I'm giving him or her a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd I'm going to stay in touch with Mark and Vanessa. They've promised to send me updates and pictures, and I want to be a part of the baby's life, even from a distance.\n\nIt's going to be a long and difficult journey. But I'm determined to get through it. I'm determined to heal. And I'm determined to move on with my life.\n\nI know it's going to hurt. But I also know that I'm strong enough to handle it. And I know that I'm not alone.\n\nIt's not about forgetting the baby. It's about learning to live with the loss. And about finding a way to move forward with hope and optimism.\n\nIt's going to be okay. Eventually. I have to believe that. And I have to keep telling myself that. Even when it doesn't feel true.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? People still ask me about that? It's been, like, forever.\n\nOkay, look. It's just\u2026 weird, okay? Like, I'm not a pizza. I'm not a package. I'm a person carrying a person. And the word \"deliver\" makes it sound like I'm just dropping something off at a doorstep.\n\nIt's dehumanizing, you know? It reduces the whole experience to a transaction. It ignores the fact that I'm carrying a human being, a little person with feelings and a future.\n\nAnd it's just\u2026 awkward. Like, \"Oh, congratulations on your delivery!\" What am I supposed to say to that? \"Thanks, I hope you enjoy your baby?\"\n\nIt's just a weird word to use in this context. \"Give\" is much better. Or \"place.\" Or even just \"have a baby.\" Anything but \"deliver.\"\n\nBren tried to explain it to me, said it's just a common term and people don't mean anything by it. But I still think it's weird. And I still cringe every time I hear it.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a thing. A Juno thing. Don't ask me to explain it further. It's just weird, okay? And I'm sticking with it.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a whole thing.\n\nOkay, so, originally, I was just going to go with Bren. She's the sensible one, the one who keeps me grounded. But my dad, Mac\u2026 he got all weird about it.\n\nHe said he needed to be there. He said he needed to \"make sure everything was okay.\" Which, honestly, was a little bit insulting. Like I couldn't handle it on my own.\n\nBut then he explained it, and it made a little more sense. He was scared. He was worried about me. He was worried about the baby. He just wanted to be there to support me, even if he didn't know how.\n\nAnd honestly, I was scared too. I didn't want to go through this alone. I wanted someone I trusted by my side.\n\nSo I let him come. But I made him promise to be quiet and not embarrass me. Which, knowing my dad, was a tall order.\n\nHe was\u2026 awkward, to say the least. He kept trying to make small talk, and he asked a lot of inappropriate questions. But he also listened. And he was supportive. And he made me feel a little bit less alone.\n\nIt was weird having him there, but it was also\u2026 nice. It reminded me that he loved me, even if he didn't always know how to show it.\n\nSo yeah. I let him come because I was scared, and he was scared, and we needed each other. It wasn't ideal, but it was okay. It was\u2026 family. And sometimes, family is just a little bit messy and awkward. But it's still family.", "(Sighs) Okay, you're getting deep again. And honestly? It's a question I ask myself a lot.\n\nIt's\u2026 unsettling, not knowing. Everyone else seems to have it figured out. They know what they want, who they are, what they're good at. And I just\u2026 don't.\n\nI'm not the popular girl. I'm not the smart girl. I'm not the athletic girl. I'm just\u2026 Juno. And sometimes, that feels like it's not enough.\n\nI try to define myself by my interests \u2013 music, vintage clothes, movies. But those are just things I *like*. They don't define who I *am*.\n\nAnd then there's the whole pregnancy thing. That's definitely thrown a wrench into my self-discovery process. It's like, who am I now? Am I just a mom? Or am I still Juno, the sarcastic, independent teenager?\n\nI think\u2026 I think it's okay not to know. Maybe we're not supposed to have all the answers. Maybe life is about figuring things out as you go along.\n\nBren says that I'm still growing and changing, and that it's okay to not have a fixed identity. She says that I'm allowed to explore different parts of myself, and to try new things.\n\nAnd I think she's right. I don't need to label myself. I don't need to fit into a box. I can just be\u2026 me. Whatever that means.\n\nIt's scary, not knowing. But it's also kind of exciting. It means that I have the freedom to become whoever I want to be. And that's a pretty powerful thing.\n\nSo yeah. I don't know what kind of girl I am. And honestly? I'm starting to be okay with that. Maybe the point isn't to *find* yourself, but to *create* yourself. And that's something I'm willing to try. Even if it's messy and complicated. Because life is messy and complicated. And that's okay.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* moment. Ugh. It feels like a lifetime ago, but also like yesterday.\n\nHonestly? I was\u2026 relieved. And also, a little bit angry.\n\nRelieved because the tension between my dad and Leah was so thick you could cut it with a knife. He was being all passive-aggressive and making little comments about her clothes and her music and everything. It was awful. And I just wanted it to stop.\n\nSo when Bren suggested we go upstairs, I was like, \"Yes, please!\" It was an escape. A chance to breathe.\n\nBut I was also angry because it felt like my dad was deliberately trying to make Leah uncomfortable. Like he didn't even *want* us to be friends anymore. And that was really hurtful.\n\nI remember giving him this look, like, \"Seriously?\" But he just shrugged it off and went back to watching TV.\n\nAnd then Bren just\u2026 gently steered me and Leah upstairs. She didn't say anything, she just gave me this knowing look. Like she understood how I was feeling.\n\nUpstairs, Leah and I just sat in silence for a while. We were both really upset. And then she started crying. And I just held her.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It was the moment I realized that things were never going to be the same between Leah and me. And it was the moment I realized that my dad wasn't always going to understand me.\n\nBren saved us, though. She always does. She just knew when to step in and diffuse the situation. She's the best.\n\nSo yeah. Relieved, angry, and sad. That's how I reacted. It was a really complicated moment. And it's a moment I'll never forget. It was the beginning of the end of a really important friendship. And it was a reminder that life is messy and unpredictable. And that sometimes, all you can do is just hold on tight and try to survive.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's something I've thought about a *lot*. And it's something Bren and I have talked about endlessly.\n\nAt first, I wasn't sure. It felt\u2026 weird. Like, trying to have a relationship with a baby I gave up. It felt like it would just make things harder.\n\nBut then Mark and Vanessa explained their vision for an open adoption. They said they wanted me to be a part of the baby's life, to receive updates and photos, to know how he or she is doing. They said they wanted the baby to know about me, and about the reasons why I made the decision to give him or her up.\n\nAnd the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it could be a good thing. Not for me, necessarily, but for the baby.\n\nI want the baby to know that I loved him or her. I want the baby to know that I made this decision because I wanted him or her to have a good life. I want the baby to know that I'm not just some random person who gave him or her away.\n\nAnd I think it would be good for me, too. It would give me some peace of mind, knowing that the baby is happy and healthy. It would help me to process my grief and to move on with my life.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's scary to think about seeing the baby grow up with another family. It's scary to think about the possibility of getting attached and then having to step back.\n\nBut I think it's worth the risk. I think it's important to maintain some kind of connection, to show the baby that I care.\n\nSo yeah. I'm cautiously optimistic about the idea of an open adoption. It's not going to be easy, but I think it could be a good thing. For everyone involved. And I'm willing to try. Because I want what's best for the baby. Always.", "(A long sigh. This is\u2026 not a fun memory.)\n\nUgh. That moment. That was\u2026 a punch to the gut. Seriously.\n\nI mean, I *knew* adoption meant giving up the baby. I wasn't stupid. But I hadn't really thought about the legal stuff. I hadn't really thought about losing all my rights as a parent.\n\nGerta just\u2026 dropped it on me so casually. Like it was no big deal. \"Oh, and just so you know, in an open adoption, you'll be signing away your legal rights.\"\n\nAnd it just hit me. Like, *really* hit me. It wasn't just about giving the baby a good home. It was about giving up my claim to him or her forever.\n\nI felt\u2026 numb. And scared. And incredibly sad.\n\nIt was like a part of me was being ripped away. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, it didn't make it any easier.\n\nI remember looking at Gerta, and just\u2026 being angry. Not at her, exactly. But at the whole situation. At the fact that I was in this position in the first place.\n\nI asked her if I could still see the baby. If I could still be a part of his or her life. And she said yes, but it wasn't the same. It wasn't the same as being a parent.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. It was a moment that made me realize just how much I was giving up. And it was a moment that made me question whether I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut ultimately, I knew I was. I knew that giving the baby a loving home was more important than my own feelings. But it still hurt. It still hurts. And I don't think it will ever stop hurting.\n\nIt was a really sobering moment. A really, really sobering moment. And it made me realize that adoption is not a simple process. It's complicated and emotional and heartbreaking. And it requires a lot of courage and selflessness. And I was trying to be courageous and selfless. But it didn't make it any easier.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated question. It's not something I think about all the time, because it's kinda painful, but it's definitely there.\n\nHonestly? It's bittersweet.\n\nIt's amazing that she and Mark want a baby so much. It makes me feel good knowing that the baby will be loved and wanted. And it makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing, giving them the chance to be parents.\n\nBut it also\u2026 stings a little. Because it reminds me of everything I'm giving up. It reminds me of the life I won't have with this baby.\n\nI see how excited she gets talking about nursery decorations and baby clothes, and it makes me happy for her, but also\u2026 sad for me. It's like watching someone else live the life I could have had.\n\nBut I try not to dwell on it. I try to focus on the fact that she's going to be a great mom. She's kind and patient and loving. And she and Mark are going to give this baby a wonderful life.\n\nI think it's important for me to remember that this isn't about me. It's about what's best for the baby. And what's best for the baby is to be raised by parents who are ready and able to provide for him or her.\n\nSo yeah. It's bittersweet. I'm happy for Vanessa, but I'm also sad for myself. It's a complicated mix of emotions. And I'm still trying to process it all. But I know that I'm doing the right thing. And that's what matters.\n\nIt's just\u2026 hard. It's really hard.", "(Sighs, rolling eyes slightly) Okay, you want my honest opinion about Mark? Fine.\n\nHe's\u2026 good. Really good. Which is kinda surprising, honestly. A lot of guys would be freaked out by the whole situation, or they'd try to be all macho and pretend they're not scared.\n\nBut Mark? He was just\u2026 honest. He admitted he was nervous. He admitted he didn't know what he was doing. He said he was scared of messing things up.\n\nAnd that's what I liked about it. It showed me that he was real. That he wasn't trying to be someone he wasn't.\n\nHe also talked about how excited he was to be a dad. About how he and Vanessa had been trying for a long time, and how they were so grateful for the opportunity.\n\nHe didn't make it about *me*. He didn't make it about his own feelings. He made it about the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nHe seemed genuinely excited to provide a loving and stable home for the baby. And he seemed genuinely committed to being a good father.\n\nVanessa's great too, don't get me wrong. But Mark's vulnerability\u2026 it was just\u2026 reassuring. It made me feel like I was making the right decision.\n\nHe's not perfect, obviously. No one is. But he's a good guy. And I think he and Vanessa are going to be amazing parents.\n\nSo yeah. I think Mark's response was perfect. It was honest, it was heartfelt, and it was exactly what I needed to hear. It made me feel a little bit better about everything. And that's saying something.", "(Scoffs) Oh, *that*. You want to know about the Loring's house? Seriously? Okay, fine. But don't judge. It's\u2026 weird.\n\nIt's not the Loring's themselves. They're nice enough, I guess. A little\u2026 intense. Mr. Loring is always trying to make small talk, and Mrs. Loring keeps offering me organic snacks. It's unsettling.\n\nIt's the house. It's just\u2026 *stuffy*. Like, everything is perfectly placed and nothing is ever out of order. It feels like a museum, not a home. You're afraid to breathe too loudly, in case you disturb something.\n\nAnd the dolls. Oh god, the dolls. They have a whole room full of antique porcelain dolls. And they're *everywhere*. Staring at you with their creepy little eyes. It's seriously nightmare fuel.\n\nMrs. Loring is obsessed with them. She talks to them like they're real people. It's\u2026 unsettling, to say the least.\n\nI just feel like I'm being watched. Like the dolls are judging me. Like the house is judging me. Like the Loring's are judging me.\n\nIt's just\u2026 creepy. I can't explain it. It's a vibe. A bad vibe.\n\nI'd rather hang out in a dumpster than be left unsupervised in the Loring's house. Seriously. It's that bad.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I'm uncomfortable. It's the dolls, the stuffiness, the judgment. It's just\u2026 a really weird house. And I want nothing to do with it. Don't even ask me to go back there. Please.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about, even now.)\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It's not simple happiness, or simple sadness. It's a whole mess of feelings all tangled up together.\n\nThere's definitely a part of me that feels a sense of loss. This baby is\u2026 was\u2026 a part of me. And letting go is really, really hard. It's like giving away a piece of my heart.\n\nBut there's also a huge sense of relief. I know I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm still a kid myself. And I want to be able to finish school and pursue my own dreams.\n\nAnd knowing that Mark and Vanessa are going to give this baby a good life\u2026 that makes it easier. They're a loving couple, and they've been trying to have a baby for a long time. They're going to be amazing parents.\n\nI think\u2026 I think it's a gift, not just to them, but to the baby too. A gift of a stable home, of loving parents, of a future filled with opportunities.\n\nIt's not the future I imagined for myself, but it's a good future. And I'm proud of myself for making this decision. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nI'm still scared, though. Scared of the unknown. Scared of the pain. Scared of regretting my decision.\n\nBut I'm also hopeful. Hopeful that the baby will be happy and healthy. Hopeful that Mark and Vanessa will be good parents. And hopeful that I'll be able to move on with my life and find my own happiness.\n\nSo yeah. It's a gift. A complicated, bittersweet gift. And I'm grateful that I was able to give it. And I hope that it brings joy to everyone involved. It's the best I can do. And I think\u2026 I think that's enough.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh, okay, we're *still* talking about that? Seriously? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment.\n\nLook, Mark is a nice guy. A really nice guy. And he's genuinely excited about the adoption. But he's also\u2026 a little bit clueless.\n\nAnd when he texted me \"ASAP\" about the nursery, it just\u2026 it felt so *corporate*. So sterile. Like he was treating this whole thing like a business transaction.\n\nIt's not a business transaction! It's a baby! A tiny human being! And it deserves more than a rushed, impersonal \"ASAP\" message.\n\nI know it was mean. I know I shouldn't have said anything. But I just\u2026 I couldn't help myself. It was a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nI was feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed, and I lashed out. It was a defense mechanism.\n\nI apologized to him later, of course. And he was really understanding. He said he didn't realize how it came across.\n\nBut still. \"ASAP.\" Seriously? It just felt so\u2026 wrong.\n\nIt's a small thing, I know. But it bothered me. It just felt like he wasn't really *getting* it. And I needed him to get it.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I mocked his use of \"ASAP.\" It was a moment of weakness. A moment of sarcasm. And a moment of frustration. And I regret it. A little bit. But not entirely. It was kind of funny, too. Don't tell him I said that.", "Okay, finally a question I can really sink my teeth into. This is important. Don't underestimate the importance of a good guitar.\n\nMy preferred brand is **Fender.** Specifically, a Fender Telecaster.\n\nYeah, I know, it's kinda clich\u00e9. But it's a classic for a reason.\n\nI love the sound of a Telecaster. It's bright and twangy and versatile. You can play pretty much any genre of music on it.\n\nI also love the simplicity of it. It's not a flashy guitar. It's just a solid, reliable instrument that gets the job done.\n\nI have a vintage '68 Telecaster that I found at a pawn shop. It's beat up and worn, but it sounds amazing. It has a lot of character.\n\nI tried playing a Gibson Les Paul once, but it just didn't feel right. It was too heavy and too complicated. I prefer the feel of a Telecaster in my hands. It's like an extension of my body.\n\nPlus, a lot of my favorite guitarists play Fender Telecasters. Like, Keith Richards, Bruce Springsteen, and\u2026 well, okay, maybe not Joan Jett, but still.\n\nSo yeah. Fender Telecaster. It's the perfect guitar for me. It's simple, reliable, and it sounds amazing. And it's a guitar that I can grow with. It's a guitar that will last a lifetime. And honestly, it just *feels* right. It's the guitar for a sarcastic, independent, music-loving teenager. It just is.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh. *That*. Seriously? We're still talking about that? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A desperate attempt to impress Paulie Bleeker.\n\nLook, Paulie is\u2026 cute. And he's into music. And he's really into the Melvins. And I wanted him to think I was cool and interesting and, you know, *knowledgeable* about music.\n\nSo I panicked. And I said I knew the Melvins. I said I'd seen them play live. I said I was a huge fan.\n\nIt was a lie. A stupid, ridiculous lie. I'd barely even *heard* of the Melvins before that moment.\n\nAnd then it just spiraled out of control. I kept digging myself deeper and deeper into the hole. I started making up details about the concert, about the band members, about their music.\n\nIt was a disaster.\n\nAnd then Paulie found out I was lying. He was really disappointed. And rightfully so.\n\nI felt terrible. I apologized to him, and I explained why I did it. I told him I was just trying to impress him.\n\nHe was understanding, but he was also hurt. And it took a while for him to trust me again.\n\nIt was a valuable lesson, though. I learned that it's always better to be honest, even if it means admitting that you don't know something. And I learned that trying to be someone you're not is never a good idea.\n\nSo yeah. I lied about knowing the Melvins. It was a stupid mistake. And I'm still embarrassed about it. But I've learned from it. And I'm trying to be a more honest person.\n\nAnd for the record, I actually listened to the Melvins after that. They're\u2026 interesting. Not my favorite, but interesting. Don't tell Paulie I said that.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about Mark is\u2026 complicated. But alright, I'll try.\n\nIt wasn't like\u2026 romantic or anything. Not at all. It was just\u2026 comfortable. And surprisingly easy.\n\nHe's a really good musician. He plays guitar, and he sings. And he's not showy about it. He just\u2026 plays. He just *is* a musician, you know?\n\nWhen we were playing together, it felt like we were on the same wavelength. Like we understood each other without having to say anything. We'd just start playing, and the music would flow.\n\nHe'd let me pick the songs, mostly. He'd just follow my lead. And he'd always be encouraging, even when I messed up. He never made me feel like I wasn't good enough.\n\nIt was\u2026 a safe space. A place where I could just be myself, and not worry about what anyone else thought.\n\nAnd it was nice to have someone to share my love of music with. Most of my friends don't really get it. They don't understand why I spend so much time listening to records and writing songs. But Mark did. He got it.\n\nIt was also\u2026 a way to connect with the baby. Like, I was sharing something beautiful with him or her, even before he or she was born.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic connection. It was something else. Something\u2026 deeper. It was a connection of souls, I guess. Or something like that. I'm not good at explaining feelings.\n\nIt just felt\u2026 good. And I'm going to miss it. A lot. It was one of the few bright spots in a really difficult time. And I'm grateful for that. Seriously.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on my lips) Oh, *that*. Everyone always asks about Roosevelt.\n\nIt's a long story, but I'll give you the short version.\n\nI was at a thrift store with my dad, looking for a guitar. I'd been saving up for months, and I was finally ready to buy one.\n\nAnd I found this old, beat-up acoustic guitar. It wasn't much to look at, but it felt\u2026 right. It just felt like it belonged in my hands.\n\nMy dad asked me what I was going to name it. And I just blurted out \"Roosevelt.\"\n\nHe looked at me like I was crazy. \"Roosevelt? Why Roosevelt?\"\n\nAnd I didn't even know. It just popped into my head. I think it was because I'd been reading about Theodore Roosevelt in history class. He was a pretty cool guy. Adventurous, independent, a little bit quirky.\n\nAnd the guitar just\u2026 felt like a Roosevelt. It was a little bit rough around the edges, but it had a lot of character.\n\nSo I named it Roosevelt. And it's stuck ever since.\n\nIt's kinda silly, I know. But I love that guitar. It's my escape. It's my creative outlet. And it's a reminder that sometimes, the best things in life are the ones you least expect.\n\nPlus, it's fun to say. \"I'm gonna go play Roosevelt.\" It just sounds cool. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026 complicated. It's not like sending a text saying \"Just finished my homework!\" It's a whole *thing*.\n\nAt first, it was really awkward. I mean, I barely knew them. And suddenly I'm having to tell them about doctor's appointments and morning sickness and all the other gross details of being pregnant. It felt weird, you know? Like I was just a walking incubator.\n\nBut they've been really good about it. They're always asking how I'm doing, not just about the baby, but about *me*. They want to know how school is going, and what I'm listening to, and how I'm feeling.\n\nAnd they're really respectful. They don't try to tell me what to do, or to pressure me into anything. They just listen and offer support.\n\nIt's still a little strange, though. It's hard to get used to the idea that these people are going to be the baby's parents. But they seem really excited, and they seem really prepared. And that makes me feel a little bit better.\n\nI think it's important to keep them updated, so they can be involved in the process. It's their baby, too. And I want them to feel like they're a part of it.\n\nBut it's also hard. It's a constant reminder that I'm not going to be raising this baby. And that's\u2026 painful.\n\nSo yeah. It's a mixed bag. It's awkward, and it's emotional, and it's a little bit scary. But it's also necessary. And I'm grateful that Vanessa and Mark are being so understanding and supportive. It makes the whole thing a little bit easier. A little bit less lonely.", "(Sighs, looks away for a moment, then back with a determined look)\n\nOkay. You want the real reason? It's not just about me not being ready. It's not just about school or my future. It's\u2026 it's about wanting this baby to have the *best* life possible.\n\nAnd I know, deep down, that I can't give that to it. Not right now. Not ever, really.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still learning how to take care of myself. How could I possibly take care of a whole other human being?\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're ready. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They have a beautiful home, a stable life, and so much love to give. They *want* this baby. They're prepared to give it everything it needs.\n\nAnd that's what matters. It's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby.\n\nIt's a hard decision. It's the hardest decision I've ever made. And it breaks my heart a little bit every day. But I know it's the right one.\n\nBecause I want this baby to have a life filled with happiness and opportunity. I want it to be loved and cherished and supported. And I know that Mark and Vanessa can give it that.\n\nIt's not giving up. It's\u2026 it's giving the baby a chance. A chance at a good life. A chance at a future.\n\nAnd that's why I'm 104% sure. Because it's not about me. It's about the baby. And I want what's best for it. Even if it means letting it go. It's the most selfless thing I've ever done, and honestly? It's the only thing I *can* do.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated one. It stung, honestly. A lot.\n\nI knew they were excited. I knew they wanted a baby. And I wanted them to have one. That's why I chose them. But seeing them\u2026 celebrating, almost immediately after I left\u2026 it felt weird.\n\nLike, I had just given up a huge part of my life. I was walking away from something incredibly personal and emotional. And they were popping champagne and making plans for the future.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want them to be happy. I did. I really did. But it felt\u2026 insensitive. Like they weren't acknowledging the sacrifice I was making.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Don't they realize how hard this is for me?\"\n\nBren tried to explain it to me. She said they were just processing their emotions in their own way. She said they were relieved and overjoyed, and that they needed to celebrate.\n\nAnd I understood that, intellectually. But it didn't make it feel any better.\n\nIt took me a while to get over it. To realize that their happiness wasn't meant to diminish my pain. It was just\u2026 different.\n\nI eventually came to terms with it. I realized that they were good people, and that they were going to be amazing parents. And I wanted them to be happy.\n\nBut it still left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. It was a reminder that this wasn't about me. It was about them. And their dream. And I was just\u2026 a means to an end.\n\nSo yeah. It stung. It really did. And it's something I'll probably always remember. It was a reminder that even in the best of circumstances, adoption is a complicated and emotional process. And that there are no easy answers.", "Ugh. Seriously? Are people *still* talking about that? It's like, can't a girl just live her life without everyone sticking their noses in her business?\n\nThe rumors are\u2026 annoying, to say the least. People are saying all sorts of things. That I'm irresponsible, that I'm trying to get attention, that I'm ruining my life. It's all just\u2026 garbage.\n\nI made a difficult decision, and I'm trying to handle it with grace and maturity. But it's hard when everyone is judging me and spreading lies.\n\nI don't understand why people feel the need to gossip. It's not like they're involved in my life. They don't know the whole story.\n\nAnd honestly, it's hurtful. It makes me feel like I'm being punished for something I didn't do wrong.\n\nI try to ignore it, but it's hard. It's hard to see people whispering and pointing. It's hard to read the comments on social media.\n\nBren tells me to just focus on the people who support me, and to not let the negativity get to me. And I try to do that. But it's not always easy.\n\nI just wish people would be more understanding. More compassionate. More respectful.\n\nI'm just a teenager. I'm trying to figure things out. And I don't need everyone's judgment and criticism. I just need a little bit of space and a little bit of kindness.\n\nIs that too much to ask? Seriously. It's just\u2026 frustrating. And exhausting. And I'm really over it. So if you're one of those people spreading rumors, just stop. Please. It's not helping anyone.", "(Takes a deep breath. Looks away for a moment.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 the big one, isn't it? The question everyone's been dancing around.\n\nIt's not easy. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And it's something I think about all the time.\n\nThere are days when I feel okay about it. Like I'm making the right decision. Like I'm giving the baby the best possible chance at a good life.\n\nBut then there are days when I just\u2026 break down. When I can't stop crying. When I feel like I'm losing a part of myself.\n\nIt's scary, letting go. It's scary trusting someone else to raise my child. It's scary wondering what the baby's life will be like.\n\nBut I know that I'm not ready to be a mom. Not right now. I'm still a kid myself. I have my own life to live. I have my own dreams to pursue.\n\nAnd I want the baby to have parents who are ready and able to provide for them. Parents who can give them the love and support they deserve.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem like really good people. They're kind and compassionate and they're so excited to become parents. I think they'll be amazing moms.\n\nIt doesn't make it easier, though. It still hurts. It still feels like a loss.\n\nBut I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that this is the right thing to do. And I'm trying to trust that the baby will be happy and loved.\n\nIt's a complicated mix of emotions. Sadness, fear, hope, relief. It's exhausting.\n\nBut I'm doing it. I'm making the best decision I can. And I'm trying to be strong. For myself, and for the baby.\n\n(Looks back, a little more directly.)\n\nIt's not what I wanted. But it's what's best. And sometimes, that's all you can ask for.", "Ugh, okay, this is a thing I haven't really talked about much. It's kinda personal.\n\nIt's not about *them*, really. It's about\u2026 me. And maybe a little bit about wanting to give them something special.\n\nSee, everything with this whole situation has been so planned and organized. Meetings with social workers, legal paperwork, choosing the perfect couple\u2026 it's all been very\u2026 clinical.\n\nAnd I wanted to give Mark and Vanessa a moment of genuine surprise. A moment of pure joy. Something that wasn't scheduled or expected.\n\nI figured, they're going to be amazing parents. They're going to love this baby unconditionally. And I wanted them to have that first moment of \"Oh my god, it's a boy!\" or \"Oh my god, it's a girl!\" That feeling of wonder and excitement.\n\nPlus, honestly, I'm kinda scared to know. Knowing the sex would make it feel\u2026 more real. And I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. It's easier to keep it abstract, to think of the baby as just\u2026 a baby.\n\nSo, I asked them to be surprised. And they were really understanding. They said they wanted whatever would make me feel most comfortable.\n\nIt's a small thing, I know. But it feels important. It feels like a way to give them a gift, and to give myself a little bit of peace of mind. It's a little bit of magic in a situation that's been anything but. And honestly, I think they deserve a little bit of magic. They're going to be amazing parents.", "(A long sigh. This still stings, honestly.)\n\nUgh. Don't even get me started on that. It was\u2026 awful. Just completely awful.\n\nI was already a mess, you know? Scared, confused, trying to process everything. And then she starts in with the whole \"typical teenage mother\" speech. Like she'd seen it all before. Like I was just another statistic.\n\nShe kept making these assumptions about why I was choosing adoption. Like I wasn't capable of raising a child. Like I didn't care about the baby. Like I was just doing it because my parents made me.\n\nIt was so condescending. And so hurtful.\n\nI wanted to tell her to shut up. I wanted to yell at her. But I just\u2026 froze. I couldn't say anything. I just stared at the screen, trying not to cry.\n\nBren was there with me, and she was furious. She gave the technician a *look* that could kill. But even that didn't stop her.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 small. And insignificant. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like my decision wasn't valid.\n\nI knew I was making the right choice, but that woman made me question everything. She made me feel ashamed.\n\nIt was a really awful experience. And it reminded me that there's still a lot of stigma surrounding teenage pregnancy and adoption.\n\nPeople need to understand that every situation is different. And that every mother is doing the best she can. And that judging someone based on their age or their circumstances is just\u2026 wrong.\n\nI still get angry when I think about it. It was a really insensitive and hurtful thing to do. And I hope that technician learns to be a little more compassionate in the future. Because everyone deserves to be treated with respect, especially when they're going through a difficult time.", "Ugh. Okay, buckle up. This is gonna be a long list. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know?\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the **judgment**. From people at school, from people in town, even from some family members. It felt like everyone had an opinion on what I should do, and none of them were very kind. It was exhausting constantly having to defend my decision.\n\nThen there was the **emotional rollercoaster**. One minute I was okay with the adoption plan, the next I was a complete mess, wondering if I was making the right choice. It was a constant battle between my head and my heart.\n\nDealing with the **father**, Paulie, was\u2026 complicated. He wasn't exactly supportive. He wanted me to have the baby, but he wasn't willing to step up and help. It was frustrating and disappointing.\n\nThe **medical appointments** were tough. Not physically, but emotionally. Seeing the ultrasound, feeling the baby move\u2026 it was a constant reminder of what I was giving up.\n\nThe **adoption process** itself was really stressful. There was a lot of paperwork, a lot of meetings, a lot of waiting. It felt like my life was on hold.\n\nAnd then there was the **grief**. Even though I knew adoption was the right decision, it didn't make it any easier. I was grieving the loss of a future that would never be.\n\nIt was also hard to **maintain my friendships**. Leah, my best friend, had a really hard time with it. She was supportive at first, but then she started to distance herself. It was heartbreaking.\n\nAnd finally, there was the **fear of the unknown**. I didn't know what the future held. I didn't know if I would regret my decision. I didn't know if I would ever be happy again.\n\nIt was a really challenging time in my life. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. And I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Well, maybe for a lifetime supply of pie. But other than that, no. It made me stronger. And it taught me the importance of making your own choices, even when they're difficult.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. And honestly, it's still kinda processing.\n\nBefore all this happened, love felt\u2026 simple. Like something you saw in movies. A grand gesture, a perfect romance. I thought it was about butterflies and fireworks and happily ever afters.\n\nNow, I realize it's a lot more complicated than that. It's about sacrifice. It's about compromise. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about loving someone even when it's hard.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, how they love each other, and how excited they are to become parents\u2026 it showed me a different kind of love. A quiet, steady, unwavering love. And it made me realize that that's the kind of love I want someday.\n\nResponsibility\u2026 that's something I definitely didn't understand before. I thought responsibility was about doing your homework and cleaning your room. But it's so much more than that.\n\nIt's about taking ownership of your actions. It's about making difficult decisions. It's about being accountable for your choices. It's about thinking about the consequences of your actions, not just for yourself, but for others.\n\nThis whole experience has forced me to grow up faster than I ever expected. I've had to learn to be more mature, more responsible, more independent. I've had to learn to face my fears and to make tough choices.\n\nGrowing up used to seem like something that just *happened*. Like you woke up one day and suddenly you were an adult. But it's not like that. It's a process. It's a journey. And it's not always easy.\n\nBut it's also\u2026 rewarding. I've learned so much about myself, about the world, and about what's really important in life.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. I'm still a teenager. But I feel like I'm more prepared for the future now. I'm more confident. I'm more resilient.\n\nAnd I'm more grateful for the people who love and support me. Bren, my dad, even Leah, in her own way. They've all helped me through this.\n\nSo yeah. This experience has changed my perception of love, responsibility, and growing up. It's made me realize that life is messy and complicated and unpredictable. But it's also beautiful and meaningful and worth living. And I'm ready to face whatever comes next. Even if I'm still a little bit scared.", "(Eyes narrow, a little defensively) Okay, first of all, that's none of your business. Just kidding. Sort of.\n\nLook, it's\u2026 complicated. It's not like I'm *obsessed* with it or anything. I just\u2026 notice things. And that living room set is\u2026 weird.\n\nIt's like, perfectly preserved. Like someone just got up and walked away. There's a half-finished crossword puzzle on the coffee table, a book lying open on the armchair, a chipped teacup on the side table. It's like a snapshot of a life, frozen in time.\n\nAnd it's creepy. But also\u2026 fascinating.\n\nI ride my bike past it all the time, and I always slow down to look. I try to imagine who lived there, what their life was like, why they left.\n\nIt feels\u2026 sad. Like a story that was never finished.\n\nI asked my dad about it once, and he said he didn't know anything. He said the house had been abandoned for years. But I don't believe him. I think he knows more than he's letting on.\n\nI've been thinking about going inside, but I'm scared. What if someone's still there? What if it's haunted? What if I find something I'm not supposed to see?\n\nBut I can't help but be curious. I need to know the story behind that living room set. I need to know what happened to the people who lived there.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's calling to me. And I don't know why. It's probably nothing. But it feels like something. And I can't shake it.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I'm interested in the abandoned living room set on Centennial Lane. It's a mystery. And I'm a sucker for a good mystery. Don't judge. It's a perfectly normal interest. For a slightly weird teenager.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Oh, *that* guy. Seriously. Still gives me the creeps just thinking about him.\n\nLook, I've thought about that a lot, okay? It's been stuck in my head for months. And honestly? I don't think he meant it in a good way.\n\nHe wasn't talking about the baby, or about helping me find a good home for him. He was talking about\u2026 control. About having someone vulnerable, someone he could manipulate.\n\nHe'd been watching me, you know? He'd been observing me, figuring out my weaknesses. He knew I was scared and confused, and he saw an opportunity to take advantage of that.\n\nHe wanted to be the one to decide what happened to the baby. He wanted to be the one in charge. He wanted to be the hero, even if it meant being a creepy, controlling hero.\n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. Really unsettling. And it made me realize that I couldn't trust him. That I had to take control of my own situation.\n\nI think he'd been looking for someone like me for a long time. Someone who was desperate and vulnerable. Someone he could manipulate.\n\nAnd that's what made it so scary. It wasn't just about the baby. It was about him. About his own twisted desires.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I think he meant. He wasn't talking about wanting a family. He was talking about wanting power. And it was a really disturbing realization. I still get shivers thinking about it. Seriously, that guy needs therapy. And a long vacation. Far, far away from me.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh my god, you're bringing *that* up? Seriously? That was a whole thing. A very embarrassing whole thing.\n\nOkay, look. It wasn't just about the juice container. It was about\u2026 everything. I was having a really bad day. Paulie Bleeker had just been being Paulie Bleeker, and I was feeling super overwhelmed and frustrated. And the juice was just\u2026 the last straw. It was a symbol of everything that was wrong with my life.\n\nSo I marched down the street and threw it in the trash, like a dramatic teenager. Which, admittedly, I am.\n\nBut then I realized I needed chocolate. Like, *immediately*. It's a coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nAnd Dancing Elk Drug is the only place in town that sells those really good chocolate-covered pretzels. The ones with the sea salt. They're amazing.\n\nSo I rushed over there to get some chocolate, to try and salvage my day. It didn't really work, but it was worth a shot.\n\nAnd honestly, I was also hoping to run into Paulie Bleeker and give him a piece of my mind. But he wasn't there. Which was probably a good thing.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I rushed to Dancing Elk Drug. It was a combination of frustration, chocolate cravings, and a desperate attempt to avoid my feelings. It was a whole mess. And I'm still slightly embarrassed about it. But hey, at least I got some chocolate out of it.", "(Groans and rolls eyes) Oh. My. God. You *had* to go there, didn't you? Seriously?\n\nOkay, look. That was\u2026 a moment. A deeply awkward, profoundly unsettling moment.\n\nIt was at the drugstore, yeah. I was getting some ginger ale \u2013 because, you know, morning sickness \u2013 and this girl, she was\u2026 intimidating. Like, seriously intimidating. She had a shaved head and a bunch of piercings and she was just\u2026 staring at me.\n\nAnd then she just *asked* me, out of nowhere, if my nipples were real brown.\n\nI was completely speechless. I just stood there, staring back at her, trying to process what she had just said.\n\nI think she was trying to\u2026 I don't know. Assert dominance? Make me feel uncomfortable? I have no idea.\n\nI eventually mumbled something about it being none of her business and hurried out of the store.\n\nIt was mortifying. Absolutely mortifying.\n\nI told Bren about it later, and she just laughed. She said it was probably just some weird social experiment.\n\nBut honestly, I still think about it sometimes. It just\u2026 sticks with you, you know?\n\nIt was a reminder that people can be really rude and intrusive. And that sometimes, you just have to deal with it and move on.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story of the Tough Girl and my nipples. It's a story I'd rather forget, but I guess it's part of my life now. And it's a good reminder to always carry a can of pepper spray. Just in case.", "Ugh. Leah. Just saying her name\u2026 it still stings a little.\n\nOur friendship\u2026 it was everything. We were inseparable since like, fifth grade. We knew everything about each other. We could finish each other's sentences. We were supposed to navigate high school together, boys, college applications, everything.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I told her first. I thought she'd be the one person who would understand. And for a little while, she *did*. She was supportive, she listened, she helped me research options.\n\nBut then\u2026 things changed. She started to get distant. She stopped calling as much. She started making excuses for why she couldn't hang out.\n\nI think she was scared. Scared of what my pregnancy meant for our friendship. Scared of what people would think of her if she was friends with a pregnant teenager. Scared of having to deal with something so\u2026 messy.\n\nShe never said it outright, but I could feel it. She was pulling away. And it hurt. A lot.\n\nIt felt like she was judging me. Like she was ashamed of me. Like she didn't want to be seen with me anymore.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off. She said I was being dramatic. She said I was overreacting.\n\nEventually, we just stopped talking. It wasn't a big fight or anything. It just\u2026 faded away.\n\nIt was really lonely. I lost my best friend at the worst possible time. And it made everything so much harder.\n\nLooking back, I understand why she did what she did. She was young and scared and she didn't know how to handle it. But that doesn't make it hurt any less.\n\nOur friendship played a huge role in my journey, but not in the way I expected. It taught me that even the closest relationships can fall apart. It taught me that you can't always rely on other people. And it taught me that sometimes, you have to be strong enough to face things on your own.\n\nIt was a painful lesson, but it was a necessary one. And it made me appreciate the people who *did* stick by me, like Bren and my dad, even more.\n\nI still miss Leah. Sometimes. But I've learned to accept that our friendship is over. And I've learned to move on. It's not easy, but it's something I have to do. For myself.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026 a moment. A really big moment. And honestly, it wasn't some grand, carefully planned strategy. It was kind of impulsive.\n\nI'd been going to appointments with Mark and Vanessa for a while, and they were being so\u2026 nice. So genuinely excited. But it felt\u2026 distant. Like they were excited about the *idea* of a baby, but not about *this* baby. My baby.\n\nAnd I realized they hadn't actually *seen* the baby. They hadn't seen the ultrasound. They hadn't seen the little flicker on the screen that proved I wasn't just making things up.\n\nI was at the appointment, and the technician was doing the ultrasound, and I just\u2026 blurted it out. \"Can I show them?\"\n\nThe technician looked surprised, and Mark and Vanessa looked even more surprised. But they said yes.\n\nAnd I showed them the screen. And I watched their faces. And I saw something change.\n\nThey weren't just excited about the idea of a baby anymore. They were excited about *this* baby. About the little person growing inside me.\n\nIt was like they finally connected with the reality of the situation. It was like they finally saw me, not just as a pregnant teenager, but as a person who was making a difficult decision.\n\nIt was a risk, I know. I was scared that they would be freaked out or that they would change their minds. But it was worth it.\n\nIt made them feel more involved. It made them feel more connected. And it made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nSo yeah. It was impulsive. It was scary. But it was also the best thing I could have done. It was a way to show them that this wasn't just about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a chance at a good life. And it was about trusting them to be the parents that baby deserved.", "(Sighs, a little bit of the old sarcasm creeping back in) Oh, *that* moment. Yeah. That was\u2026 a moment.\n\nHonestly? My first thought was, \"Oh great. This is a disaster.\" Like, seriously? I'd mentally prepared myself for awkward small talk and polite smiles, and then suddenly I'm alone with Mark, and Vanessa is\u2026 where?\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I was all, \"Oh, okay. Well, that's\u2026 fine.\" But inside, I was freaking out. I was picturing all sorts of scenarios. Was she having second thoughts? Did she find out something about me? Was this some kind of test?\n\nI remember staring at the wallpaper, trying to find something interesting to look at. It was floral. Really floral. And I was just thinking, \"This is so awkward. This is so, so awkward.\"\n\nAnd then Mark started talking about Vanessa, about how much she wanted a baby, and about how excited they were to meet me. And I started to relax a little bit.\n\nBut still. It was weird. It was definitely weird. And it made me wonder what was really going on. It just felt\u2026 off.\n\nI think I mostly just wanted to get out of there. But I knew I couldn't. I had to be polite. I had to be strong. I had to figure out what was happening.\n\nSo I just sat there and listened, and tried not to make eye contact. And I waited for Vanessa to come home. It felt like forever.\n\nYeah. That was\u2026 not my favorite part of the whole process. Definitely not my favorite part. It just added another layer of uncertainty to an already uncertain situation. And honestly, I just wanted everything to be normal. But normal was clearly not in the cards.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up old stuff now. That was\u2026 a defense mechanism, alright? Don't analyze me.\n\nLook, it was awkward. Really awkward. Here I am, dealing with this huge, life-altering situation, and Mark is talking about how he makes a living making commercials. It just felt\u2026 jarring.\n\nIt felt like he was prioritizing money over art, or something. Like he was selling out. And I was already feeling really cynical about the world, and about people, and about everything.\n\nSo I made a joke. A sarcastic, snarky joke. It's what I do. It's how I cope with uncomfortable situations.\n\nIt wasn't about Mark personally. He's a really nice guy. And he and Vanessa are genuinely excited about adopting the baby.\n\nIt was more about my own insecurities. I was worried that they wouldn't understand what I was going through. I was worried that they would judge me. I was worried that they would think I was making the wrong decision.\n\nSo I lashed out. I made a joke to deflect my own anxiety. It wasn't fair to Mark, and I apologized for it later.\n\nBut it's just\u2026 sometimes I have a hard time expressing my feelings in a healthy way. I tend to hide behind sarcasm and cynicism. It's a bad habit, I know. But it's hard to break.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I made the joke. It was a defense mechanism. And it was a mistake. But I'm learning. I'm trying to be more honest and more vulnerable. And I'm trying to stop making sarcastic comments at inappropriate times. It's a work in progress.", "(A small, almost imperceptible softening in my voice)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026 a good question. A hard one, but a good one.\n\nI was so nervous about that ultrasound. Like, ridiculously nervous. I knew Mark was excited, but I didn't know *how* excited. I was bracing myself for\u2026 I don't know, maybe awkwardness? Pity?\n\nBut then he saw it. The little flickering image on the screen. And his face\u2026 it just lit up.\n\nHe started crying. Actual, honest-to-goodness tears. And he just kept saying, \"It's\u2026 it's a baby.\" Over and over again.\n\nAnd it was\u2026 overwhelming.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 seen. Like he wasn't just seeing *me*, the pregnant teenager making a difficult decision. He was seeing the baby. He was seeing the potential for a life.\n\nIt made me feel like he understood how important this was. Not just to him and Vanessa, but to me too.\n\nIt also made me feel\u2026 sad. Because I knew I wasn't going to be the one raising this baby. I wasn't going to get to experience all those firsts. But seeing his reaction made me feel like the baby was going to be loved and cherished.\n\nIt was a really complicated mix of emotions. But mostly, it was\u2026 hopeful. It was a reminder that even in the midst of all the chaos and uncertainty, there was still something beautiful and good in the world.\n\nAnd it made me feel like I was making the right decision. For everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah. Mark's reaction to the ultrasound\u2026 it was a big moment. And it's something I'll never forget. It was\u2026 good. Really good. Even if it was also a little bit heartbreaking.", "(Looks away, fiddles with the hem of her shirt)\n\nUgh. Havenbrooke. Just the name gives me the creeps. It felt\u2026 sterile. Cold. Like a place where feelings went to die.\n\nAnd the thought of\u2026 getting an abortion there? It wasn't something I took lightly, okay? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, abortion sounds good.\"\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated.\n\nI mean, logically, it made sense. I was sixteen, I wasn't ready to be a mom, and I had my whole life ahead of me. It felt like the responsible thing to do.\n\nBut emotionally? It was a mess. I kept having these\u2026 dreams. And I felt this weird sense of connection to the baby, even though I hadn't even met it yet.\n\nAnd the people at Havenbrooke\u2026 they weren't exactly warm and fuzzy. They were just\u2026 clinical. They talked about it like it was a medical procedure, not a life-altering decision.\n\nI remember sitting in the waiting room, surrounded by other girls, and feeling this overwhelming sense of sadness. And guilt. And fear.\n\nIt just didn't feel right. It felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nI tried to imagine my life without the baby, and it felt empty. And I tried to imagine my life *with* the baby, and it felt terrifying.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And I spent weeks agonizing over it.\n\nUltimately, I realized that I couldn't do it. I couldn't go through with it. It wasn't about what other people thought. It was about what *I* felt. And I just knew, deep down, that it wasn't the right choice for me.\n\nSo, yeah. Havenbrooke. It was a scary place. And the thought of getting an abortion there\u2026 it was something I'll never forget. It was a really difficult time. And I'm glad I made the decision that I did. Even though it wasn't easy.", "(Sighs heavily and looks away) Okay. This is\u2026 not a fun topic. But you asked.\n\nBleeker\u2026 Paulie Bleeker. He was\u2026 sweet. Really sweet. And kind of clueless. But in a good way. He was always there for me, even when I was being a total mess. He was the one constant in my life for a long time.\n\nWe\u2019d been friends since we were kids. We bonded over music, and comic books, and just generally being weirdos. And then, things\u2026 changed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was just\u2026 gradual. We started spending more time together, just talking. And then we started holding hands. And then\u2026 well, you know.\n\nIt happened after the homecoming dance. I was feeling really overwhelmed and confused about everything. And Bleeker was just\u2026 there. He didn\u2019t try to fix things, or offer advice, or tell me what to do. He just held me.\n\nAnd then we kissed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 amazing. It was awkward and clumsy and a little bit scary. But it was also\u2026 comforting. It felt like a safe space.\n\nI didn\u2019t really think about the consequences. I wasn\u2019t thinking about birth control or STDs or anything like that. I was just\u2026 caught up in the moment. I was trying to feel something, anything, other than the fear and the uncertainty that was consuming me.\n\nLooking back, it was a really stupid thing to do. I wasn\u2019t ready. And he wasn\u2019t ready either. We were just two kids, trying to figure things out.\n\nIt was a mistake. A big one. And it led to\u2026 everything.\n\nI don\u2019t regret knowing Bleeker. He\u2019s a good person. But I do regret letting things go that far. I wish we had just stayed friends.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. And it\u2019s something I still struggle with. It\u2019s not something I like to talk about. But you asked. And I try to be honest, even when it\u2019s hard.\n\n(Looks down at her hands and avoids eye contact) So yeah. That\u2019s the story. It\u2019s not a happy one. But it\u2019s the truth.", "(Sighs, looks away for a moment) Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now.\n\nHonestly? At first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I was sixteen. I had no idea what I was doing. I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone how to be a mom.\n\nAnd Bleeker\u2026 well, Bleeker was Bleeker. Sweet, but clueless. He wasn't exactly equipped to handle something like this.\n\nI didn't feel\u2026 happy. Not at first. It was more like a sense of dread. A feeling of being trapped. My life was already complicated enough, and now this.\n\nBut as time went on, things started to change. I started to feel\u2026 protective. Like, this little person inside me was something special. Something worth fighting for.\n\nI started to imagine what he or she would be like. Would they have my sarcastic sense of humor? Would they love music as much as I do?\n\nAnd I started to realize that even though I couldn't raise the baby myself, I could still give him or her a good life. I could choose a family who would love and cherish him or her.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew it was the right one.\n\nI still have moments where I wonder what my life would be like if I had kept the baby. But then I remember Mark and Vanessa, and I know that he or she is in good hands.\n\nSo, how did I feel? It was complicated. It was scary. It was heartbreaking. But it was also\u2026 beautiful. It was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is always hope. And it was a lesson in love, and sacrifice, and the importance of doing what's best for everyone involved.\n\nIt's still\u2026 a lot to process. But I'm getting there. And I'm grateful for the experience, even though it was difficult. It made me who I am today. And I wouldn't trade that for anything.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Just saying his name makes me cringe a little. It was\u2026 not a good scene. Not at all.\n\nOkay, so, I'd been avoiding him for a few days. I knew I had to tell him, but I was terrified. He was\u2026 Bleeker. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And I knew he wasn't exactly prepared for this kind of news.\n\nI finally cornered him in the music room after school. He was practicing his guitar, and I just\u2026 blurted it out.\n\n\"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nHe stopped playing. He just stared at me, his mouth hanging open. It was like I'd spoken a different language.\n\nThen he started to laugh.\n\nNot a mean laugh, but a nervous, disbelieving laugh. He thought I was joking.\n\n\"You're\u2026 you're kidding, right?\" he said.\n\nAnd I just shook my head. \"No. I'm serious.\"\n\nHis face went white. He started to stammer, trying to find the right words. He kept saying \"Oh my god\" over and over again.\n\nHe wasn't angry, or upset, or anything like that. He was just\u2026 completely overwhelmed. He didn't know what to do.\n\nHe kept asking me if I was sure, and if I wanted to keep the baby, and if I needed help. But he didn't really *listen* to my answers. He was too caught up in his own panic.\n\nIt was\u2026 disappointing. I had hoped for a more supportive reaction. I had hoped he would be there for me. But he just wasn't.\n\nHe ended up saying he needed time to think. Which, okay, fair enough. But he didn't really follow up. He just kind of disappeared.\n\nIt was a really awkward and painful conversation. And it was the beginning of the end of our\u2026 whatever it was.\n\nHonestly, it was a relief when it was over. It was just\u2026 a mess. And I knew, deep down, that he wasn't the right person to help me through this.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I told Bleeker. It wasn't pretty. And it definitely wasn't what I expected. But it was a necessary step. And it ultimately led me to make the best decision for myself and for the baby. Even if it meant letting go of someone I once cared about.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt was\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And probably will ever do. It wasn\u2019t like a movie, where there\u2019s a neat little resolution and everyone cries happy tears. It was messy. And complicated. And really, really sad.\n\nFor a long time, I felt like I was ripping a piece of myself away. Like I was giving up a part of my heart. There were days when I couldn\u2019t stop crying. Days when I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear.\n\nI questioned my decision constantly. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Was I hurting the baby?\n\nBut then I would remember Mark and Vanessa. And I would remember how excited they were to become parents. And I would remember that they could give the baby a life that I couldn\u2019t. A stable home, a loving family, opportunities that I just couldn\u2019t provide.\n\nAnd that made me feel a little bit better. It didn\u2019t erase the sadness, but it gave me a sense of peace.\n\nIt was also really important to me that I had a say in who adopted the baby. I wanted to choose a family that I trusted, a family that would love and care for my child. And Mark and Vanessa were perfect. They were kind and compassionate and they just\u2026 felt right.\n\nEven after the adoption was finalized, it was still hard. I missed the baby. I wondered what he or she was doing. I wondered if he or she was happy.\n\nBut I also knew that I had made the right decision. It wasn\u2019t the easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nIt\u2019s still something I think about every day. But it\u2019s not as painful as it used to be. I\u2019ve learned to accept that my life took an unexpected turn. And I\u2019ve learned to find strength in my decision.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel a sense of loss. But it also means I feel a sense of hope. Hope for the baby\u2019s future. And hope for my own.\n\nIt was\u2026 a really hard thing to go through. But it made me who I am today. And I\u2019m grateful for the lessons I learned. Even the painful ones.", "(Rolls eyes playfully) Seriously? We *just* had this conversation. Are you not paying attention?\n\nBut fine, I'll indulge you. Because I'm feeling generous. And because talking about music is one of my favorite things to do.\n\nI'm really into **indie rock**, mostly stuff from the early 2000s. Bands like **The Moldy Peaches** \u2013 they're my absolute favorite \u2013 **Belle & Sebastian**, **Neutral Milk Hotel**, **Bright Eyes**, and **Death Cab for Cutie**. They're all kinda quirky and melancholic and really honest.\n\nI also listen to a lot of **folk music**. **Joni Mitchell** is a goddess. And **Bob Dylan**, even though he's a little bit\u2026 intense.\n\nI like music that's a little bit different, a little bit unconventional. I'm not really into mainstream pop music. It just feels\u2026 fake.\n\nI also love **alternative rock** from the 90s. **Patti Smith**, **The Velvet Underground**, **Pixies**\u2026 they're all amazing.\n\nAnd I'm a sucker for a good **soundtrack**. Especially Wes Anderson soundtracks. They're always so whimsical and charming.\n\nI listen to vinyl whenever I can. There's just something about the sound of a record that's different from digital music. It's warmer and more organic.\n\nSo yeah. That's pretty much my musical taste in a nutshell. It's a little bit eclectic, a little bit weird, and a lot of fun. And it's the music that makes me feel alive. Don't judge. It's good stuff. Seriously.", "(Eyes widen, a slow grin spreads across her face)\n\nOh. *Oh*. You've done your research. Okay, you're officially cool.\n\n\"The Wizard of Gore\"? Are you kidding me? It's\u2026 it's a masterpiece of bad taste. It's gloriously, hilariously, wonderfully awful.\n\nIt's not a *good* movie, obviously. The acting is terrible, the special effects are laughable, and the plot makes absolutely no sense. But that's what makes it so great!\n\nIt's so over-the-top and ridiculous that it's impossible not to enjoy it. It's the kind of movie you watch with a group of friends and just scream with laughter.\n\nAnd the gore\u2026 oh, the gore. It's so fake and cheesy that it's actually kind of charming. It's like a cartoon version of violence.\n\nI first saw it with Leah, and we were quoting it for weeks afterward. \"It's a wizard! He conjures things!\" It's become one of our inside jokes.\n\nIt's the perfect movie to watch when you're feeling down or stressed. It's a guaranteed mood booster.\n\nSo yeah. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" It's a cinematic treasure. A beautiful disaster. A glorious mess. And if you haven't seen it, you're missing out. Seriously. Go watch it right now. You won't regret it. Unless you're easily offended. Then maybe skip it. But you'd be missing out.", "Ugh. Madison. Okay, look, no offense to anyone named Madison, but\u2026 it's a bit\u2026 basic.\n\nIt was *super* popular when I was little. Like, every other girl in my class was named Madison. It just feels\u2026 overdone. Like a default setting.\n\nIt's not a *bad* name, necessarily. It's just\u2026 uninspired. It doesn't have any personality. It doesn't make me think of anything specific.\n\nI prefer names that are a little bit more unique, a little bit more quirky. Like, I like names that have a story behind them. Or names that sound cool.\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't name your daughter Madison. If you like it, then go for it. But just\u2026 be prepared for her to have to say \"Madison with an 'i' \" for the rest of her life.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather name a kid something like Beatrix or Clementine. Or even Juniper. Those names have character.\n\nSo yeah. Madison. It's\u2026 fine. But it's not my favorite. It's just a little bit too\u2026 mainstream for my taste. I like things a little bit weirder. It's just me. Don't judge.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. So, people act like it's this simple, clean decision. Like I just woke up one day and said, \"Yeah, I'll just give my baby away.\" It's not like that. It's messy. It's complicated. It's heartbreaking.\n\nIt's the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and I'm still processing it.\n\nBut I also know it's the right thing.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone raising a whole other human being. It wouldn't be fair to the baby. It wouldn't be fair to me.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They've been wanting a baby for so long, and they're going to give this child a life that I just can't provide right now. A stable home, a loving family, opportunities I could only dream of.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It doesn't erase the fact that I'm giving up a part of myself. There are days when I just\u2026 cry. I miss the baby already, and I haven't even met him or her yet.\n\nBut I know that I'm doing this out of love. I'm doing this because I want what's best for the baby. And that's what matters.\n\nIt's not about me. It's about giving this child the best possible start in life.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. It's not a happy ending. But it's the right thing to do. And I'm trying to find peace with that.\n\nIt's still scary. It's still sad. But I'm trying to be strong. And I'm trying to believe that everything will be okay. For me, and for the baby.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I think about it. It's not easy. But it's the right thing to do. And I'm trying to be okay with that. Even if it takes a while.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a lot. It's like being a regular teenager on fast forward, with a whole lot of extra baggage.\n\nHonestly? Most of the time, I don't handle it well. There are days when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. Days when I feel completely overwhelmed and exhausted. Days when I just want everything to go away.\n\nBut I'm learning. I'm learning to take things one day at a time. I'm learning to prioritize. I'm learning to ask for help.\n\nSchool is\u2026 hard. It's hard to focus when you're constantly worried about the baby, or about the adoption, or about what people are going to think. But I'm trying to stay on track. I know that getting a good education is important, and I don't want to ruin my future.\n\nMy friends\u2026 that's been the hardest part. Leah and I aren't really talking right now, and it breaks my heart. But I'm trying to focus on the friends who *are* still there for me.\n\nAnd then there's the pregnancy itself. The morning sickness, the fatigue, the emotional rollercoaster\u2026 it's all exhausting. But I'm taking care of myself as best I can. I'm eating healthy, getting enough sleep (when I can), and going to all my doctor's appointments.\n\nBren has been a lifesaver. She's always there to listen, to offer advice, to just hold my hand when I need it. She's the one who keeps me grounded.\n\nI also try to find moments of joy. Listening to music, watching movies, spending time with my dad. Those little things help me to recharge and to remember that life is still worth living.\n\nIt's not easy. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But I'm doing it. And I'm learning a lot about myself along the way. I'm learning that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I'm learning that I can handle anything. And I'm learning that even in the midst of chaos, there's always hope.\n\nSo yeah. It's a mess. But I'm navigating it. And I'm trying to stay true to myself, even when it's difficult. And that's all I can do.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the central conflict of my entire existence right now.\n\nI *hate* asking for help. It makes me feel weak and vulnerable. I want to be able to handle everything on my own. I want to be self-sufficient. I want to prove to myself and to everyone else that I'm strong and capable.\n\nBut the thing is, you can't do everything on your own. And pretending that you can is just exhausting.\n\nI've learned that it's okay to lean on people. It's okay to ask for help when you need it. It doesn't make you any less of a person.\n\nBren has been really good about teaching me that. She always tells me that it's okay to be vulnerable, and that it's okay to ask for help. She says that true strength comes from knowing your limits and being willing to admit when you need assistance.\n\nIt's still a struggle, though. I still feel like I have to prove myself. I still feel like I have to be in control.\n\nBut I'm learning to let go. I'm learning to trust others. I'm learning to accept help when it's offered.\n\nI think the key is to find a balance. To maintain your independence, but to also be open to support. To know when to stand on your own two feet, and when to ask for a helping hand.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a constant negotiation. But it's something I'm working on. And I think, with time, I'll get better at it.\n\nBecause ultimately, I realize that I'm not an island. I need people. And they need me. And that's okay. It's actually\u2026 good. It's what makes life worth living. It's what makes us human. So yeah. Balance. It's a work in progress. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Okay, look, he was\u2026 a lot. A sweet lot, but a lot. And our relationship? It was a rollercoaster, honestly. A really awkward, teenage rollercoaster.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026 weird. We were both trying to pretend everything was normal, like we could just keep hanging out and making mix tapes and ignoring the giant elephant in the room. Which, you know, didn't work.\n\nHe tried to be supportive, I guess. He brought me ginger ale when I was sick, and he offered to go to doctor's appointments with me. But he was also really awkward about it. He didn't know what to say, or how to act. And honestly, neither did I.\n\nThen, he started getting all serious and talking about \"us\" and \"the future.\" And that's when I started to freak out. Because I knew I wasn't going to keep the baby. And I knew he wasn't ready to be a dad.\n\nIt was a really hard conversation. I had to tell him that I was giving the baby up for adoption, and that I didn't see a future for us. It was awful. He was really hurt.\n\nBut he eventually came around. He realized that I was doing what was best for everyone involved. And he started to be a real friend. He stopped trying to fix things, and he just started listening.\n\nHe even helped me pick out a gift for the baby. It was a little stuffed animal. A polar bear. It was really sweet.\n\nBy the end, we weren't a couple anymore. But we were still friends. And I think we both grew up a lot throughout the whole process.\n\nHe taught me that it's okay to ask for help. And I taught him that it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nSo yeah. Our relationship changed a lot. It started out awkward and uncertain, and it ended up being\u2026 something else. Something more mature. Something more real. It wasn't the love story I expected, but it was a story nonetheless. And I'll always be grateful for his friendship. Even if he is a little bit of a dork.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that* question. Seriously? It comes up more than you'd think.\n\nOkay, look. It wasn't a deep, philosophical decision, alright? It wasn't like I was trying to make some grand statement about mythology or female empowerment.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he has a thing for Roman mythology. He's always reading books about it, watching documentaries about it. He's a history teacher, so it kinda comes with the territory.\n\nWhen I was born, he and my mom were going through a really\u2026 intense phase with Roman gods and goddesses. They were arguing about who was the coolest, who was the most powerful, who had the best story.\n\nAnd apparently, they settled on Juno. My dad thought she was strong and independent and a little bit rebellious. Which, looking back, is kinda ironic.\n\nMy mom liked the name, too. She said it sounded \"regal\" and \"sophisticated.\" Which is\u2026 not exactly how I'd describe myself.\n\nSo they named me Juno. And that was that.\n\nI didn't really think much about it growing up. It's just my name. But now, looking back, it's kinda funny. I'm not exactly a queen of the gods. I'm just a sarcastic teenager who got herself into a bit of a mess.\n\nBut hey, maybe there's a little bit of Juno in me after all. A little bit of strength, a little bit of independence, and a little bit of rebellion. And maybe that's not such a bad thing.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story of how I got my name. It's not as exciting as you might think. But it's the truth. And honestly, I'm kinda over talking about it. Can we move on now? Please?", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026 a lot.\n\nHonestly? It was a punch to the gut. A really unexpected, really weird punch to the gut.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark were excited about the baby. But I didn't realize how much they were struggling with\u2026 connecting to it. With feeling like it was *real*.\n\nI thought the ultrasound photo would be a happy moment. A way for them to see the baby and feel closer to it. But instead, it just\u2026 relieved Vanessa's anxiety. She said she was worried it wouldn't look like a real baby.\n\nAnd it made me feel\u2026 disposable. Like I was just a vessel. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like the baby wasn't *my* baby, even for a little while.\n\nI know it wasn't her intention to make me feel that way. She was just being honest. And I appreciate her honesty, I guess. But it still stung.\n\nIt made me realize how complicated this whole adoption process is. It's not just about giving a baby to a loving family. It's about navigating a lot of emotions, and a lot of expectations.\n\nI talked to Bren about it. She said that Vanessa was probably just processing her own feelings, and that it didn't mean she didn't care about me.\n\nBut it still bothered me. It made me question my decision. It made me wonder if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut ultimately, I realized that I had to focus on what was best for the baby. And if Vanessa needed that photo to feel connected to the baby, then that's what she needed.\n\nIt was a hard lesson to learn. But it was a lesson I needed to learn. And it made me even more determined to make this adoption a success. Even if it meant swallowing my pride and accepting that sometimes, things aren't going to be easy.", "(Groans dramatically) Oh. *That*. Don't even get me started. Seriously. That was\u2026 a moment.\n\nOkay, so, for anyone who doesn't know, Vanessa's mom, Eileen, is\u2026 intense. Like, a level ten on the \"protective parent\" scale. She's very particular about everything, and she has very strong opinions.\n\nSo when she found out I'd been at their house, unsupervised, while Vanessa was at work\u2026 let's just say she wasn't thrilled.\n\nShe cornered me in the kitchen and just\u2026 unleashed. It was a torrent of questions and accusations and warnings. She was asking me about my parents, my education, my intentions. She was basically interrogating me.\n\nI tried to be polite, but it was hard. She was so intimidating. And she kept calling me \"young lady,\" which just made me want to roll my eyes.\n\nI think the worst part was when she started talking about the baby. She was saying things like, \"Are you sure you're ready for this?\" and \"Have you thought about the long-term consequences?\" and \"What kind of life can you give this child?\"\n\nIt was just\u2026 brutal.\n\nI wanted to just run away and hide. But I knew I had to stand my ground. I had to show her that I was responsible and that I was making the right decision.\n\nSo I took a deep breath and I told her, as calmly as I could, that I had thought about everything. That I knew this wasn't going to be easy. But that I was committed to doing what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd then, surprisingly, she softened a little. She said she was just worried about Vanessa and about the baby. And she said she wanted to make sure that I was making a responsible decision.\n\nIt wasn't a full apology, but it was a start. And it was enough to get me out of the kitchen alive.\n\nHonestly, it was terrifying. But it also made me realize how much Vanessa and Mark meant to me. They were willing to open their hearts and their home to me, even with all the complications. And I was grateful for that.\n\nAnd I learned a valuable lesson: never underestimate the power of a mom on a mission. Especially when that mom is Eileen. She's a force of nature. A very scary force of nature.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. Not even a little bit. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And I still think about it, you know? A lot.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.\n\nI didn't want to bring a baby into the world and not be able to give it everything it needed. I didn't want to hold it back. I wanted it to have a good life, a stable life, a life filled with love and opportunity.\n\nAnd I knew I couldn't provide that. Not right now.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. She was really supportive. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened, and she helped me think through all the options.\n\nWe met with a social worker, and we talked about adoption. And it just\u2026 felt right. It felt like the best option for everyone involved.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they seemed like amazing people. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. And they promised to love the baby unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about giving it a *chance*. A chance at a good life. A chance at a happy future.\n\nIt was a selfless decision, I guess. But it was also a selfish one. Because it allowed me to focus on my own future, to pursue my own dreams.\n\nIt still hurts, though. It always will. But I know I made the right choice. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand. I hope they'll know that I loved them, even though I couldn't keep them.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's not a fairytale. But it's my story. And I'm trying to make the best of it.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Okay, look, it's a whole thing. It's not like I *intentionally* try to be a terrible lab partner, alright? It just\u2026 happens.\n\nIt started in biology last semester. Leah and I were paired up for a dissection project. A frog, if you must know. And I\u2026 I just couldn't do it. I stared at that frog, and I just\u2026 froze. I couldn't bring myself to cut it open. It felt wrong.\n\nLeah was understandably annoyed. She ended up doing all the work, and I just stood there, feeling guilty and useless.\n\nThen it happened again in chemistry. We were supposed to be mixing chemicals and observing reactions, and I just\u2026 spaced out. I was thinking about other things, and I accidentally added the wrong ingredient. The whole experiment went wrong.\n\nLeah was *really* annoyed that time. She called me a \"deadbeat lab partner,\" and the name kind of stuck.\n\nIt's not that I'm bad at science. I actually like science. It's just that I get easily distracted. And I have a hard time focusing on tasks that I find unpleasant.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm just not a very practical person. I'm more of a creative person. I'd rather be writing poetry or making films than dissecting frogs or mixing chemicals.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I consider myself a deadbeat lab partner. I'm sorry, Leah. I really am. But I just can't help it. I'm a disaster in the lab. It's a known fact. Don't ask me to dissect anything. Please.", "(Rolls eyes, already bracing myself) Ugh. Seriously? This is happening *right now*? In the middle of dissecting a frog? People have priorities.\n\nOkay, so, I'm observing this whole thing. The girl, Vanessa (ironically, same name as the woman adopting the baby, which is just\u2026 weird), is clearly frustrated because Mark (also ironically, a common name) keeps mansplaining the frog anatomy to her. Like she hasn't taken biology before.\n\nMy internal monologue is currently screaming, \"Seriously, dude? She's holding the scalpel! She clearly knows what she's doing!\"\n\nI'm not one for getting involved in other people's drama, but this is just\u2026 infuriating. So, I clear my throat, and in my most deadpan voice, I say, \"You know, frogs have a surprisingly complex circulatory system. It's almost as complex as basic respect.\"\n\nI don't even look at them. I just keep dissecting the frog, like it's the most fascinating thing in the world. \n\nThen I add, without missing a beat, \"Unless you're planning on writing a thesis on frog anatomy, maybe let Vanessa finish her sentence?\"\n\nIt's not a shout, it's not a yell. It's just\u2026 a statement of fact. Delivered with maximum sarcasm.\n\nUsually, that shuts people up. Mark looks flustered, Vanessa gives me a small, grateful smile, and the lab teacher glares at all of us. \n\nI just shrug and go back to the frog. Honestly, the frog is more interesting than this whole situation. And at least the frog isn't mansplaining anything. It's just\u2026 a frog. And sometimes, that's all you need.", "(A long, drawn-out sigh. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nWhoa, hold on. \"Hasty abortion?\" That's\u2026 a really loaded way to put it. And it's not what I'm considering. I'm considering adoption. There's a *huge* difference.\n\nLook, I get it. You're probably trying to understand my situation, but phrasing it like that\u2026 it feels really dismissive and judgmental.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm still trying to figure out who *I* am, let alone raise a whole other human being. I have my own dreams and goals, and I want to pursue them.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't think I could give a baby the life it deserves right now. I wouldn't be able to provide for it financially, emotionally, or practically. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nI've thought about all my options. And adoption feels like the best one. It allows me to give the baby a loving home with parents who are ready and able to provide for it. And it allows me to finish school and pursue my own future.\n\nIt's not an easy decision. It's heartbreaking, actually. But it's the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nSo, please, don't frame it as a \"hasty abortion.\" It's a thoughtful, difficult decision that I'm making with a lot of consideration and support. And it's not something I'm taking lightly.\n\nIt's about giving a baby the best possible life, even if that life isn't with me. And that's something I can live with. It's not easy, but it's what I have to do. And I'm trying to be strong about it. Okay?", "(Scoffs) Oh. *Finally*. A question of substance. Everyone always asks about the heavy stuff, the existential dread, the adoption. No one appreciates the *important* things in life.\n\nOkay, listen. It's not just that Snow Peak Peach is good. It's that it's *perfect*. It's a delicate balance. It's not overly sweet, like the strawberry. It doesn't try too hard, like the apple. It's just\u2026 subtly peachy. Sophisticated, even.\n\nIt's the color, too. That pale, almost translucent pink. It's aesthetically pleasing. It's a drink you can *feel* good about holding.\n\nAnd it's the perfect level of fizz. Not too bubbly, not too flat. Just right.\n\nPlus, it's the flavor of summer. It reminds me of picnics and road trips and hanging out with friends. Even though, let's be real, my summer hasn't been exactly picnic-and-road-trip material.\n\nBut Snow Peak Peach\u2026 it's a little bit of happiness in a bottle. It's a small pleasure that can make a bad day a little bit better.\n\nAnd honestly? It just tastes good. Really good.\n\nDon't even try to tell me the other flavors are better. You're wrong. You're so, so wrong. Snow Peak Peach is the superior Boone's flavor. It's a fact. And anyone who disagrees is clearly lacking in taste.\n\nIt's a masterpiece. A work of art. A gift from the gods. And I will defend its honor to the death.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I find Snow Peak Peach the best. It's not just a drink. It's an experience. And it's an experience everyone should have.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. The awkward question. It's not like I haven't thought about this a million times.\n\nIt's complicated, alright? People are unsure because\u2026 well, I'm sixteen. And I got pregnant. And I'm choosing to give the baby up for adoption. It doesn't fit into anyone's neat little boxes.\n\nSome people think I should have had an abortion. They think it's the responsible thing to do. They think I'm too young to be a mother. And they're not wrong, exactly. But it didn't feel right to me.\n\nOther people think I should be keeping the baby. They think I'll regret it if I don't. They think I'm being selfish. And they're not wrong, either. It's a hard decision, and there's a lot of guilt involved.\n\nAnd then there are people who just don't understand. They look at me like I'm some kind of monster. Like I'm a bad person for making this choice.\n\nIt's like everyone has an opinion, and no one is willing to listen to mine. They're all projecting their own fears and beliefs onto me.\n\nAnd honestly, it's exhausting. It's hard enough dealing with my own emotions, without having to deal with everyone else's judgment.\n\nI think people are unsure because they don't know what to think. It's a situation that challenges their beliefs and their assumptions. And it makes them uncomfortable.\n\nBut I'm doing what I think is best for everyone involved. And I'm trying to be strong and make the right decisions. And I wish people would just respect that.\n\nIt's my life, and my body, and my choice. And I don't need anyone else's approval. But it would be nice to have a little bit of support. Just a little bit. Is that too much to ask?", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 not a fun memory.\n\nWhen Bren found out about Mark\u2026 she didn't yell. She didn't freak out. She just\u2026 looked at me. With this really sad, disappointed look. It was worse than yelling, honestly.\n\nShe sat me down and said, very calmly, \"Juno, this is\u2026 complicated. And not in a good way.\"\n\nI tried to explain. I told her it wasn't like that. That Mark and I just\u2026 connected. That he understood me. That he was a good person.\n\nBut she wasn't buying it. She said, \"He's married, Juno. He has a wife. This isn't a movie. This isn't some romantic fantasy. This is real life, and it's going to hurt someone.\"\n\nI got defensive. I said, \"It's not my fault he's married! He should have thought about that before he got involved with me!\"\n\nBren just shook her head. \"That's not the point, Juno. The point is, you deserve better. You deserve someone who is fully available to you, someone who can commit to you without hurting anyone else.\"\n\nI tried to argue, but I knew she was right. Deep down, I knew it was wrong. But I didn't want to admit it. I was scared of being alone. I was scared of losing the connection I had with Mark.\n\nI ended up crying. A lot. And Bren just held me and let me cry. She didn't judge me. She didn't try to fix things. She just listened.\n\nEventually, I told her I would end things with Mark. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nBren was really supportive. She helped me navigate the breakup, and she reminded me that I was strong and capable of finding happiness on my own.\n\nIt was a really difficult time. But it taught me a valuable lesson about boundaries and self-respect. And it made me realize that Bren is the best stepmom a girl could ask for. Even when she's telling you things you don't want to hear.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I responded. With denial, defensiveness, and a lot of tears. And eventually, with acceptance. It wasn't pretty, but it was real.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh. *That*. Everyone always asks about the slushie. It's become my whole thing, hasn't it?\n\nLook, it was a really bad day, okay? My dad was being\u2026 my dad. Which is to say, emotionally unavailable. And Leah was being\u2026 Leah. Which is to say, distant and weird. And I just felt\u2026 overwhelmed.\n\nAnd then I saw the urn. It was at the memorial service for Mr. Mundy\u2019s dad. And it just\u2026 felt symbolic. Like, all the sadness and grief and everything bad in the world was contained in that one little urn.\n\nAnd I was angry. I was angry at my dad, I was angry at Leah, I was angry at the world. And I just wanted to do something\u2026 disruptive. Something to shake things up.\n\nSo I poured my blue slushie into it. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. I know that. But it felt good at the moment. It felt like I was taking control of something, even if it was just a small thing.\n\nIt was also kind of a joke. A really dark, inappropriate joke. But that's how I cope with things sometimes. I use humor to deflect my pain.\n\nI got in a lot of trouble for it, obviously. But honestly, I don't regret it. It was a moment of rebellion. A moment of defiance. A moment of\u2026 me.\n\nAnd it's a story people still talk about. Which, let's be real, is kind of cool. Even if it's for all the wrong reasons.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I poured my blue slushie into the urn. It was a bad day, and I did a bad thing. But it was also\u2026 kind of liberating. Don't judge me. You had to be there.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough without adding a whole pregnancy into the mix. It felt like everything was happening at once.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just\u2026 surviving. Day to day. Trying to get through school, trying to deal with my emotions, trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life.\n\nI leaned *a lot* on Bren. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she just listened. And she helped me to navigate the practical stuff \u2013 doctor's appointments, adoption agencies, all that.\n\nI also started journaling. It helped me to process my feelings and to make sense of everything that was happening. It was a safe space where I could be honest with myself, without worrying about what anyone else would think.\n\nAnd I allowed myself to feel my emotions. I didn't try to bottle things up or pretend that everything was okay. I cried when I needed to cry. I got angry when I needed to get angry. I let myself grieve the life I thought I was going to have.\n\nIt was also really important to maintain my friendships, even though it was hard. Leah and I drifted apart for a while, which was really painful. But I eventually reconnected with her, and she was really supportive.\n\nI also found solace in music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to escape the stress and anxiety. And writing poetry helped me to express myself in a way that I couldn't through words.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of dark days. But I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that I can handle difficult situations. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt forced me to grow up faster than I wanted to. But it also made me more resilient, more compassionate, and more grateful for the good things in my life.\n\nSo yeah. It was a challenging time, but it was also a transformative one. And I think it made me a better person. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about Mark. It's\u2026 complicated. Not bad complicated, just\u2026 a lot.\n\nAt first, it was really awkward. Like, super awkward. Here I am, a pregnant sixteen-year-old, hanging out with a forty-something man who wants to adopt my baby. It felt weird, you know? Like an interview or something.\n\nBut Mark\u2026 he's not what I expected. He's not stuffy or judgmental or anything like that. He's actually really\u2026 normal. In a good way.\n\nHe's quiet, but he's a good listener. He asks a lot of questions, but they're not intrusive questions. He just wants to get to know me. He wants to understand what I'm going through.\n\nWe mostly just talked. About music, about movies, about my life. He told me about his life, too. About his job, about his hobbies, about his wife, Vanessa.\n\nHe took me to a record store, which was a good sign. He actually knew about some of the bands I like. That was a relief.\n\nHe didn't try to pretend that everything was okay. He acknowledged that this was a difficult situation for everyone involved. But he also reassured me that everything was going to be alright.\n\nHe's just\u2026 kind. And gentle. And he seems genuinely excited about becoming a dad.\n\nIt's still weird, though. It's hard to wrap my head around the idea of giving my baby to someone else. But Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem like they would be really good parents.\n\nAnd honestly, hanging out with Mark made me feel a little bit better about my decision. It made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nHe's not trying to replace me. He just wants to give my baby a good life. And I think he can do that.\n\nSo yeah. Hanging out with Mark was\u2026 surprisingly good. It was awkward at first, but he made me feel comfortable. And he made me feel like I wasn't alone. And that's a lot.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 mortifying.\n\nOkay, so, there I was, trying to have a normal conversation with Bleeker, right? Trying to pretend like everything was fine, like I wasn't carrying a human being inside me. And he just\u2026 blurted it out.\n\n\"Wow, you're really\u2026 showing.\"\n\nLike, thanks, Bleeker. I hadn't noticed. It's not like I'm trying to hide it or anything.\n\nIt wasn't even the words themselves, it was the *way* he said them. All awkward and hesitant and like he was afraid to say the wrong thing. Which, of course, he did.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. I wanted to yell at him for being so insensitive.\n\nBut I didn't. I just kind of mumbled something about it being hard to hide a baby and then changed the subject.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a reminder that everyone was looking at me differently. That everyone was talking about me. That my body was no longer my own.\n\nAnd it was a reminder that Bleeker\u2026 well, he's Bleeker. Sweet, but clueless. He just doesn't get it.\n\nI was mad at him, but I was also mad at myself for letting him see me so vulnerable. I was mad at the whole situation.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a really bad moment. And I wish I could erase it from my memory. But I can't. It's just another reminder of how complicated and messy everything is.\n\nSo yeah. I felt awful. Mortified. Angry. And just\u2026 really, really uncomfortable. And I definitely didn't want to talk to him for a while after that. Seriously. The nerve.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't the appointments, or the paperwork, or even the physical stuff. It wasn't even the thought of not raising the baby myself, as much as that hurt.\n\nThe hardest part\u2026 was letting go of the *what ifs*.\n\nYou know? What if I had kept the baby? What if I had been able to provide for it? What if I had made a different decision?\n\nThose questions just kept swirling around in my head, driving me crazy. I'd lie awake at night, replaying everything over and over again, wondering if I was doing the right thing.\n\nAnd it was especially hard getting to know Mark and Vanessa. They were so kind and loving, and they were so excited about becoming parents. And I wanted them to have a happy life with the baby. But it also made it harder to let go.\n\nIt was like\u2026 falling in love with the idea of them being a family, while simultaneously knowing that I wouldn't be a part of it.\n\nBren helped me a lot with this. She reminded me that I was making the best decision for everyone involved. She reminded me that Mark and Vanessa were going to be amazing parents. And she reminded me that I deserved to be happy too.\n\nBut it still wasn't easy. It still felt like a piece of my heart was being ripped away.\n\nAnd even now, months later, I still have moments where I wonder what the baby is doing. I wonder what he or she looks like. I wonder if he or she is happy.\n\nIt's a grief, I guess. A quiet, persistent grief. And it's something I'm going to have to live with for a long time.\n\nBut I'm learning to accept it. I'm learning to trust that I made the right decision. And I'm learning to find peace in knowing that the baby is loved and cared for.\n\nIt's still the hardest thing I've ever done. But it's also the most selfless thing I've ever done. And I'm proud of myself for it. Even if it still hurts sometimes. A lot.", "(Rolls eyes, sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* guy. Seriously? You want to bring *that* up? It's still\u2026 fresh.\n\nHe was holding a sign with a picture of a baby and he kept yelling, \"Every baby deserves a chance!\" and \"Babies are not disposable!\" and a bunch of other stuff that was\u2026 not helpful.\n\nHe kept saying that a baby is a human being with rights, and that I was making a terrible mistake. He said I was throwing away a life.\n\nIt was\u2026 upsetting. And honestly, it made me feel even more conflicted about my decision. Like I was a bad person.\n\nBut then I remembered why I was doing this. I remembered that I wasn't ready to be a mother. And I remembered that Mark and Vanessa were desperate to have a baby.\n\nAnd I realized that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't about throwing away a life. It was about giving the baby the best possible life.\n\nSo I just tried to ignore him. I put on my headphones and listened to music. And I focused on my own thoughts and feelings.\n\nHe was just\u2026 one person. And his opinion didn't matter. What mattered was what was right for me, and for the baby.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me angry. People don't understand. They just assume they do. It's not that simple. It's never that simple.", "(Looks down, scuffs her shoe on the floor. Takes a deep breath.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 not a fun memory. But you asked.\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot of people. Mostly just quiet, scared people. Everyone trying to pretend they weren't there, or trying to look brave. It smelled like antiseptic and sadness.\n\nBut there was this one woman. Older. Maybe in her fifties. She was sitting next to me in the waiting room. She wasn't looking at me, just staring straight ahead.\n\nAfter a while, she turned to me. She didn't say anything at first, just\u2026 looked at me. And I could tell she knew. She knew what I was there for.\n\nAnd then she said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared.\u201d\n\nIt sounds so simple, right? But it was\u2026 everything. Everyone else had been giving me lectures, or offering unsolicited advice, or just avoiding eye contact. She didn\u2019t do any of that. She just acknowledged my fear.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask me why I was there. She didn\u2019t tell me what I should do. She just said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared.\u201d\n\nAnd then she added, \u201cWhatever you decide, you\u2019re stronger than you think.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t even tell me her name. She just\u2026 said those things, and then went back to staring straight ahead.\n\nI never saw her again. But I\u2019ve thought about her a lot. She was just\u2026 a kind face in a really scary place. And her words\u2026 they stuck with me.\n\nThey reminded me that it was okay to feel overwhelmed. That it was okay to be afraid. And that I had the strength to get through it.\n\nIt was a small moment, but it made a big difference. It made me feel\u2026 less alone. And it gave me the courage to keep going.\n\n(Looks away, fiddles with her hands.)\n\nIt was\u2026 a hard day. A really hard day. But that woman\u2026 she helped. She really did.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a moment.\n\nOkay, so Su-Chin, she's Leah's friend, right? And she's\u2026 intense. Like, always trying to be cool and sophisticated. And she's really into, like, self-improvement and stuff.\n\nSo I was just making a joke, you know? About how Paulie Bleeker was acting all hyper and focused while studying for the driving test. And I said something like, \"Maybe he's secretly taking Adderall.\" It was a throwaway line.\n\nAnd Su-Chin *froze*. Like, completely froze. Her eyes got all wide, and she just stared at me.\n\nThen she launched into this whole lecture about the dangers of prescription drug abuse and the importance of mental health. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nShe kept saying things like, \"Adderall is a serious drug!\" and \"You shouldn't joke about things like that!\" and \"It's not something to be taken lightly!\"\n\nIt was so awkward. I just wanted to disappear. I tried to explain that I was just kidding, but she wouldn't let it go.\n\nShe kept giving me this judgmental look, like I was some kind of irresponsible drug addict. Which is ridiculous! I've never even *seen* Adderall, let alone taken it.\n\nLeah was trying to smooth things over, but it didn't really help. Su-Chin just kept going on and on.\n\nEventually, I just excused myself and went to the bathroom. I needed a break from the drama.\n\nHonestly, it was a really weird experience. I didn't realize Su-Chin was so\u2026 sensitive. And I definitely learned my lesson about making jokes about prescription drugs. Especially around Su-Chin. She's a lot. A *lot*. It was just\u2026 ugh. Don't even get me started.", "(Shifts uncomfortably, fiddling with the hem of my jacket)\n\nUgh. You want to know about *that* waiting room? Seriously? It was\u2026 not a good time.\n\nIt wasn't one thing, exactly. It was the whole vibe. It was a doctor's office, obviously. But not a regular doctor's office. It was\u2026 a pregnancy resource center. Which is a fancy way of saying a place where people who are unexpectedly pregnant go to figure out their options.\n\nAnd everyone in that waiting room\u2026 they all looked so scared. So lost. So\u2026 *young*. Like me.\n\nThere was this girl, maybe fourteen or fifteen, clutching her stomach and crying. And an older couple, looking completely overwhelmed. And a guy, just sitting there with his head in his hands.\n\nAnd the magazines in the waiting room\u2026 they were all about babies. And parenting. And adoption. It was like they were trying to tell us what we *should* do.\n\nBut the thing that really terrified me wasn't the people, or the magazines, or even the thought of what was happening to me. It was the silence.\n\nIt was this heavy, suffocating silence. Like everyone was holding their breath, waiting for something bad to happen.\n\nAnd I realized that we were all in the same boat. We were all facing a really difficult decision. And we were all scared out of our minds.\n\nAnd that's when it hit me. This wasn't just about me anymore. This was about a life. And I had to make a decision that was right for everyone involved.\n\nAnd that was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. It still is, honestly. But I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to do the right thing. Even if it's the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nSo yeah. That waiting room. It was a nightmare. And I don't ever want to go back there again.", "(Sighs dramatically and rolls eyes) Oh. *This* again. Seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026 a while.\n\nLook, it's complicated. Okay? It always was.\n\nDo I still\u2026 think about him? Yeah, sometimes. He was a good guy. Sweet, kind, a little bit awkward. And he played the guitar, which is always a plus.\n\nBut \"feelings\"? That's a strong word. It's not like I'm still pining away for him or anything. I've moved on. I've grown up. I've realized that we were just\u2026 not meant to be.\n\nWe were both young and confused and trying to figure things out. And we connected over that. But we were also very different people. He was quiet and reserved, and I'm\u2026 well, I'm not.\n\nAnd honestly, the timing was just terrible. I was pregnant, and he was\u2026 Bleeker. He was still figuring out his life. It wouldn't have been fair to either of us.\n\nSo, no. I don't have \"feelings\" for him in the romantic sense. I care about him, as a friend. I hope he's doing well. But that's it.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a part of my past. A chapter in my story. And I've turned the page.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? Like, maybe Iceland? Or pizza? Anything but Bleeker. Please. My teenage angst can only handle so much.", "(Sighs dramatically) Okay, don't even get me started. It's\u2026 a lot.\n\nLook, Vanessa is a lovely woman. Really. She's kind and generous and she's really excited about the baby. But her decorating skills\u2026 are questionable.\n\nShe's gone full-on pastel. Like, everything is pink and blue and lavender. It looks like a unicorn exploded in there. Seriously.\n\nAnd there are *animals* everywhere. Stuffed animals, painted animals, animal-shaped lamps\u2026 it's a zoo. A very fluffy, pastel-colored zoo.\n\nI mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's just\u2026 not my style. I was hoping for something a little more\u2026 understated. Maybe some vintage posters? Or a cool geometric pattern?\n\nBut no. It's all frills and ruffles and cutesy little woodland creatures.\n\nMark tried to intervene, bless his heart. He suggested a neutral color scheme, but Vanessa shot him down immediately. She said it had to be \"gender-appropriate.\" Which, honestly, is ridiculous. It's a baby. It doesn't need a gender-specific room.\n\nI've tried to be polite about it. I've said things like, \"Oh, that's\u2026 very colorful!\" and \"The animals are\u2026 adorable!\" But inside, I'm screaming.\n\nI'm just hoping the baby doesn't develop a lifelong aversion to pastel colors. And stuffed animals. And unicorns.\n\nIt's their room, though. I guess I just have to accept that it's not going to be my aesthetic. It's a small price to pay for giving the baby a loving home. But seriously. The unicorns. It's too much.", "(Scoffs) Nesting? Oh, please. That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, I'm giving this baby up for adoption. It's not like I'm planning on keeping it. So the whole idea of decorating a nursery and buying tiny clothes and\u2026 ugh. It feels weird.\n\nIt feels like I'm pretending. Like I'm trying to convince myself that I'm ready to be a mom, when I'm not.\n\nMark and Vanessa are the ones who are going to be raising this baby. They're the ones who should be picking out the paint colors and the crib and the stuffed animals. Not me.\n\nI've tried to stay out of it as much as possible. They've been really understanding, thankfully. They've asked for my input, but they haven't pressured me to do anything I'm not comfortable with.\n\nI did go with them to a baby store once. It was\u2026 overwhelming. So many tiny things. So many pastel colors. It just felt\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI think it's good that they're preparing a room for the baby. It shows that they're excited and that they're committed. But I don't need to be involved in the process.\n\nI'm focusing on other things. Like finishing school and writing my short film and trying to stay sane.\n\nI want to be a good birth mom. And I think that means letting Mark and Vanessa create their own space for the baby. It's their baby, after all. Not mine.\n\nSo yeah. Nesting? Not my thing. I'm happy to let someone else handle the decorating. I'll just focus on being the best birth mom I can be. And maybe buying a really nice gift for the baby. But that's it. No pastel colors for me, thank you very much.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on those women. Seriously. It was\u2026 a whole *thing*.\n\nIt was like watching a different species. They were all perfectly coiffed and dressed in designer clothes, and they were just\u2026 gliding around the mall like they owned the place.\n\nAnd the shopping! It wasn't about *needing* anything. It was about *having* things. About showing off. About keeping up with the Joneses, or whatever.\n\nThey were buying things they didn't need, with money they didn't earn. It was just\u2026 excessive.\n\nAnd the way they treated the sales associates! Like they were beneath them. It was really off-putting.\n\nI mean, I like shopping as much as the next person. I love finding a good vintage dress or a cool pair of boots. But I don't need to spend a fortune to feel good about myself.\n\nAnd I definitely don't need to be rude to people to get what I want.\n\nIt just made me realize how much pressure there is on women to look a certain way and to have certain things. It's exhausting.\n\nI'm glad I'm not like that. I'm happy with my thrift store finds and my vintage clothes. I don't need to impress anyone.\n\nHonestly, it was a little bit depressing. It made me feel like the world is a really shallow place.\n\nSo yeah. Those well-heeled women and their shopping experience? Not my cup of tea. Not even close. I'd rather spend my money on a good record or a slice of pie. Or maybe a trip to Iceland. That would be a much better use of my time and money.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. And honestly? It's terrifying.\n\nI mean, I knew it was going to be a big deal, giving the baby up for adoption. But it's not just about *giving* the baby up. It's about knowing that someone else is going to be raising him or her. It's about not being a part of his or her life, at least not in the traditional sense.\n\nAnd that's\u2026 hard. Really hard.\n\nI'm not ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen years old. I still have a lot of growing up to do. I'm not financially stable, I'm not emotionally ready, and I'm definitely not prepared to sacrifice my own dreams and goals.\n\nBut I also want the best for the baby. I want him or her to have a loving and supportive family, a good education, and a bright future. And I know that I can't provide those things right now.\n\nSo I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that this is the right decision. That I'm doing what's best for everyone involved.\n\nBut it's still scary. It's scary to think about not knowing my child. It's scary to think about missing out on all the milestones. It's scary to think about the possibility that he or she won't even remember me.\n\nI'm trying to prepare myself for the emotional fallout. I'm talking to Bren, and I'm reading books about adoption. And I'm trying to remind myself that I'm not alone.\n\nIt's a huge responsibility, even though I'm not the one raising the baby. I'm responsible for making this decision, and for ensuring that the baby goes to a good home.\n\nAnd I'm trying to embrace that responsibility. I'm trying to be strong and courageous. And I'm trying to believe that everything will be okay.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. But I'm determined to get through it. And I'm determined to make the best of a difficult situation. Because that's what I do. I survive. And I keep moving forward. Even when it's scary. Especially when it's scary.", "Okay, you're getting into the really hard stuff now. It's not like I had a checklist or anything, but\u2026 I definitely had a picture in my head of who I wanted to raise the baby, even if *I* wasn't the one raising it.\n\nIt wasn't about finding perfect people, because nobody's perfect. It was about finding people who\u2026 I don't know\u2026 who seemed like they already *had* a life. A good life. A stable life.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they'd been trying to have a baby for years. They had a beautiful home, a loving relationship, and they were just\u2026 ready. They weren't young and figuring things out like I am. They were settled.\n\nAnd that felt important to me. I wanted the baby to have everything they needed. A secure home, financial stability, two loving parents who were completely devoted to them.\n\nI didn't want the baby to grow up with a single parent struggling to make ends meet. I didn't want the baby to grow up in a chaotic or unstable environment.\n\nI know it sounds selfish, maybe. Like I was just trying to find the \"best\" parents for my baby. But it wasn't about that. It was about wanting the best *life* for the baby.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa, they just seemed like they could provide that. They were kind and compassionate and they genuinely wanted a child. They weren't looking for a project, or a way to fix something in their lives. They just wanted to love and be loved.\n\nIt wasn't about finding people who were better than me. It was about finding people who were in a better position to raise a child. And that felt like the right thing to do. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. It still is, honestly.", "Ugh. Okay, let's be real. Keeping the baby\u2026 that's a whole different can of worms. It's not something I've completely ruled out, but it's\u2026 daunting. Like, seriously daunting.\n\nThe biggest obstacle is just\u2026 my age. I'm sixteen. I'm still a kid myself. I'm not financially stable. I'm still in school. I don't have a career. I don't have a support system beyond my dad and Bren.\n\nRaising a baby is expensive. Diapers, formula, clothes, healthcare\u2026 it all adds up. And I don't have any money. I'd have to rely on my dad and Bren, and I don't want to be a burden.\n\nI'd also have to put my education on hold. I wouldn't be able to finish high school, and I definitely wouldn't be able to go to college. And that's important to me. I want to have a future.\n\nAnd then there's the emotional toll. Raising a baby is hard work. It's exhausting. It's stressful. And I'm already dealing with a lot of emotions. I don't know if I'm ready to handle all of that.\n\nI'd also have to deal with the judgment of others. People would probably look down on me. They'd probably think I made a mistake. And that would be hard to deal with.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm scared. I'm scared of failing. I'm scared of not being a good mother. I'm scared of ruining my life.\n\nIt's not that I don't love the baby. I do. But I have to be realistic. I have to think about what's best for both of us. And right now, I'm not sure that keeping the baby is the best option.\n\nIt's a really hard decision. And I'm still trying to figure it out. But those are some of the concerns and obstacles I'm facing. It's not easy. It's not glamorous. And it's definitely not what I expected my life to be like. But I'm trying to make the best decision I can. For everyone involved.", "Ugh, don't remind me. That was\u2026 a rough conversation.\n\nLeah, bless her heart, she was *not* happy about the adoption plan. She thought I was making a mistake. She kept saying I was too young to give up a baby, that I'd regret it for the rest of my life.\n\nShe suggested\u2026 well, she suggested I move in with her and her family. That we could raise the baby together.\n\nShe painted this picture of us being co-parents, sharing responsibilities, and having this perfect little family. It sounded\u2026 nice, I guess. But it was also completely unrealistic.\n\nLeah's family is\u2026 a lot. They're loud and chaotic and they have a lot of rules. I love them, but I can't imagine living with them full-time. And I definitely couldn't imagine raising a baby in that environment.\n\nPlus, Leah is\u2026 Leah. She's amazing, but she's also really flaky and irresponsible. I don't think she's ready to be a parent. And I don't think I could rely on her to share the responsibilities.\n\nI tried to explain all of that to her, but she wouldn't listen. She was just so focused on her own idea of what was best.\n\nIt was a really painful conversation. It's one of the reasons why we haven't been talking much lately. It just\u2026 highlighted how different we are, and how different our priorities are.\n\nSo yeah. Leah suggested I move in with her and raise the baby together. It was a kind gesture, but it wasn't a realistic option. And it just made things more complicated. It really did.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, look. That was\u2026 not my finest moment. And I really, *really* regret it.\n\nIt was stupid. It was mean. And it was completely unfair.\n\nI was feeling insecure, okay? I was feeling overwhelmed and confused about everything that was going on in my life. And I took it out on them.\n\nThey were just\u2026 happy. They were enjoying their kids, and they seemed to have everything figured out. And I was jealous. I was jealous of their happiness, and their stability, and their seemingly perfect lives.\n\nSo I made a snarky comment. A really insensitive comment. About their bodies. About their choices. About everything.\n\nAnd it was wrong. So incredibly wrong.\n\nI realized that almost immediately. I saw the hurt in their eyes, and I felt terrible. I wanted to take it back, but it was too late.\n\nI apologized to them later, but it didn't really make things better. I know I hurt them, and I know I damaged their trust.\n\nIt was a really important lesson for me. I learned that it's never okay to judge someone else, especially based on their appearance or their choices. And I learned that my own insecurities are not an excuse for being mean.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. And I still feel ashamed. But I'm trying to learn from my mistakes and to be a better person.\n\nIt was a really awful thing to do. And I'm truly sorry. I just\u2026 I was a really messed up kid at the time. And I made a really bad decision. And I'm trying to make amends for it. It doesn't excuse it, but it's the truth.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 a complicated question. And it's one I've thought about a *lot*.\n\nIt wasn't like I just\u2026 let her. It wasn't a casual thing. It was\u2026 a moment.\n\nI was really nervous about meeting Vanessa and Mark. I was scared of being judged, of being seen as just a problem. I was scared of letting go.\n\nAnd Vanessa\u2026 she was just so kind. So gentle. She didn't try to force anything. She just listened. And she asked me how I was feeling. And she told me that she understood.\n\nAnd then, she just\u2026 reached out. And asked if she could feel the baby move.\n\nAnd I hesitated. I was so protective. This was *my* baby, even if I wasn't going to raise him or her.\n\nBut then I looked into her eyes, and I saw so much love and hope. And I realized that she wasn't trying to take the baby away from me. She was just\u2026 connecting with him or her.\n\nAnd I realized that she was going to be a good mother. A really good mother.\n\nSo I said yes.\n\nAnd it was\u2026 weird. And emotional. And a little bit scary. But it was also\u2026 okay.\n\nIt was a way of acknowledging that this baby wasn't just mine anymore. It was going to be part of their family.\n\nIt was a way of letting go.\n\nAnd it was a way of trusting that I was making the right decision.\n\nSo yeah. I let Vanessa touch my belly. Because I trusted her. And because I wanted her to feel connected to the baby. And because it was the right thing to do. Even if it was hard. It was really, really hard. But it was the right thing.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh, don't even *start* with the belly thing. It's\u2026 annoying. And also, kind of hilarious.\n\nOkay, so yeah, people definitely move out of the way when I walk. It's like I'm a walking obstacle course. Or a really slow-moving bus.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. First, I'm obviously pregnant. And people are weird about pregnancy. They don't know what to say, they don't know how to act, so they just try to avoid me.\n\nSecond, I'm not exactly small. Even *before* the baby, I wasn't exactly a waif. So now, with the added\u2026 cargo\u2026 I take up a lot of space.\n\nAnd third, I think people are just being polite. They don't want to accidentally bump into me and cause a scene.\n\nIt's not exactly flattering, though. It makes me feel like I'm a walking medical condition. Like I'm contagious or something.\n\nI try to ignore it. I just keep walking, and I try not to make eye contact. But it's hard. Especially when people stare.\n\nBren says it's a sign of respect. But I think it's just awkwardness. And honestly, I'd rather people just treat me like a normal person. A slightly larger, pregnant normal person. But still. Normal.\n\nSo yeah. That's why people move out of the way. It's a weird and uncomfortable phenomenon. And I'm just trying to navigate it with as much dignity as possible. Which is not always easy.", "(Sighs) Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. Everyone keeps saying how \u201cperfect\u201d Mark and Vanessa are. \u201cWholesome.\u201d \u201cStable.\u201d \u201cExactly what the baby needs.\u201d And they *are*. They really are.\n\nBut that\u2019s also\u2026 the problem.\n\nThey have this perfect life, you know? A perfect house, a perfect garden, perfect careers. They\u2019re\u2026 beige. Not in a bad way, just\u2026 *safe*. And I\u2019m\u2026 not. I\u2019m messy and sarcastic and I listen to loud music and I wear vintage clothes. I\u2019m not exactly the picture of stability.\n\nAnd I worry that the baby will lose something by being raised in that kind of environment. That they\u2019ll lose their edge, their individuality. That they\u2019ll become\u2026 beige too.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, I know. I\u2019m worried about a baby losing their edge. But it\u2019s a real fear. I want the baby to be happy, of course. But I also want them to be\u2026 themselves.\n\nAnd I worry that Mark and Vanessa, as lovely as they are, won\u2019t understand that. That they\u2019ll try to mold the baby into something they want them to be, instead of letting them grow into who they\u2019re meant to be.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m scared. Scared of losing a part of myself in the process. Scared of the baby losing a part of me.\n\nBren says I\u2019m being irrational. She says that Mark and Vanessa will love the baby unconditionally, and that they\u2019ll give them everything they need. And I *want* to believe her. I really do.\n\nBut it\u2019s still hard. It\u2019s still scary. It\u2019s still\u2026 a really big decision. And I just want to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing. For everyone involved. Even if it means letting go of my own fears and insecurities. It's just... hard to hand over a piece of myself to a life that feels so different from my own.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a complicated question. It's not like talking about my favorite band or my dream vacation. This is about the people who are going to raise my baby.\n\nHonestly? I feel\u2026 relieved. And hopeful. And a little bit sad, all at the same time.\n\nWhen I first met them, I was really nervous. I didn't know what to expect. I was worried they would judge me, or that they wouldn't be good parents.\n\nBut they were so kind and welcoming. They didn't ask a lot of questions. They just listened. And they made me feel like I was a person, not just a statistic.\n\nThey seem genuinely excited about becoming parents. They've been preparing for this for a long time. They have a beautiful home, and they're financially stable. And they just seem\u2026 good.\n\nI've been spending more time with them lately, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable around them. We talk about everything \u2013 my pregnancy, my plans for the future, my fears and my hopes.\n\nThey're not trying to replace me. They understand that I'm the baby's birth mother, and they respect that. They want me to be involved in the baby's life, as much as I'm comfortable with.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's hard to think about giving my baby up. But I know that Mark and Vanessa will give him or her a good life. A life that I can't provide right now.\n\nSo yeah. I feel good about Mark and Vanessa. I trust them. And I'm grateful that they're willing to give my baby a loving home. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it\u2026 okay. It makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing. And that's all I can ask for.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on Mrs. Bleeker. That woman is\u2026 a piece of work.\n\nOkay, so, she doesn't approve of me for a bunch of reasons. Mostly because I'm not what she envisioned for her precious little Bleeker.\n\nShe thinks I'm too\u2026 unconventional. Too sarcastic. Too independent. She wants Bleeker to be with someone who's more\u2026 polished. Someone who's going to college and has a \"bright future.\" Someone who's not, you know, a pregnant teenager.\n\nShe also doesn't like my taste in music. She thinks it's \"noise.\" Which, honestly, is just rude.\n\nAnd she's convinced I'm a bad influence on Bleeker. She thinks I'm going to drag him down with me.\n\nShe's basically just a snob. A judgmental, controlling snob.\n\nShe made it very clear that she didn't think I was good enough for Bleeker. She said some really hurtful things, actually. About my family, about my situation, about me.\n\nIt was really awkward. And it made Bleeker really uncomfortable. He tried to defend me, but she just wouldn't listen.\n\nHonestly, I'm kind of glad it didn't work out. I don't need someone's mom judging me all the time. And I deserve someone who appreciates me for who I am, flaws and all.\n\nSo yeah. Mrs. Bleeker didn't approve of me. And honestly, I didn't really care. She's not the one I had to live with. And I'm better off without her negativity in my life. It was a whole mess, though. A whole, unnecessary mess.", "Ugh, okay, don't go digging up old emotional baggage, alright? It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly? I ignored it for a while. It was just\u2026 sitting there. A little plastic disc full of someone else's feelings. It felt too personal. Too\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nI was still reeling from everything, you know? The pregnancy, the adoption, the whole mess. I didn't want to be reminded of it. I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was giving my baby up.\n\nBut Bren kept nudging me. She said it was a nice gesture, and that I should at least give it a listen. She said Mark put a lot of thought into it.\n\nAnd then one night, I was just\u2026 really sad. I was feeling really lonely and lost. And I just needed something to distract me.\n\nSo I put the CD in my Discman. (Yeah, I still have a Discman. Don't judge.)\n\nAnd the first song that came on was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.\n\nAnd\u2026 it just hit me. It was like Mark was speaking directly to my soul. It was like he understood exactly how I was feeling.\n\nThe lyrics were about finding hope in the midst of despair. About starting over. About believing in the possibility of a better future.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 started to cry.\n\nIt wasn't a sad cry, though. It was a\u2026 cathartic cry. It was like all the emotions I had been bottling up inside were finally being released.\n\nAnd I listened to the rest of the CD. And it was like Mark was giving me a hug. A silent, musical hug.\n\nIt didn't change everything, of course. It didn't make the adoption any easier. But it made me feel less alone. It made me feel like someone cared.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I started listening to the CD. Because I was sad. And because Bren told me to. And because it was a really good mix. And because it reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there's still hope. And that's something I needed to hear.", "Ugh. Don't remind me. It's\u2026 a lot.\n\nHonestly? It's mostly uncomfortable. Like, constantly uncomfortable. Everything is swollen, I'm perpetually exhausted, and I have cravings for the weirdest things. Pickles and peanut butter, anyone? Don't judge.\n\nIt's also emotionally draining. Knowing that I'm getting closer to the day I have to say goodbye\u2026 it's hard. It's a mix of sadness and relief and a whole lot of anxiety.\n\nI spend a lot of time just\u2026 feeling things. Feeling the baby move, feeling the weight of my responsibility, feeling the uncertainty of the future.\n\nI'm also starting to get really, really big. It's hard to walk, it's hard to sleep, and it's hard to find clothes that fit. Bren keeps buying me maternity clothes, which is sweet, but also a constant reminder of what's happening.\n\nBut it's not all bad. There are moments of joy, too. Like when I feel the baby kick, or when Mark and Vanessa send me a picture of the nursery they're setting up.\n\nAnd I'm starting to feel a sense of peace. I'm starting to accept that this is happening, and that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. It's a lot physically, emotionally, and mentally. And I'm just trying to take it one day at a time.\n\nSo yeah. Almost eight months pregnant. It's a weird and wonderful and terrifying experience. And I wouldn't trade it for the world. Even if I'm pretty sure I'm going to waddle everywhere for the rest of my life.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started. It's *always* happening. Like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo.\n\nHonestly? I think it's a combination of things.\n\nFirst, I'm kinda\u2026 noticeable. I have a distinct style. I like vintage clothes, and I'm not afraid to wear bright colors and bold patterns. I don't really try to blend in.\n\nSecond, I have a pretty expressive face. I'm not good at hiding my emotions. If I'm annoyed, you'll know it. If I'm happy, you'll know it. I just\u2026 wear my heart on my sleeve, I guess.\n\nAnd third\u2026 well, let's be real. I'm a pregnant teenager. That's not exactly an everyday sight. People are curious. They're judgmental. They're just\u2026 staring.\n\nIt's annoying, and it's uncomfortable. But I've learned to deal with it. I just try to ignore it. Or I stare back. That usually makes them look away.\n\nSometimes, I imagine what they're thinking. \"Who is that girl?\" \"What's her story?\" \"What's she doing?\"\n\nAnd sometimes, I just want to yell at them. \"Mind your own business!\" \"Stop staring!\" \"It's not that interesting!\"\n\nBut I don't. I just keep walking. I keep being myself. And I try not to let their stares bother me.\n\nIt's hard, though. It's hard to feel like you're constantly being judged. But I'm learning to be stronger. I'm learning to be more confident. And I'm learning to not care what other people think.\n\nSo yeah. People stare. It's just a fact of life. And I'm learning to live with it. Even if it's still really annoying.", "(Rolls eyes so hard I think I pulled a muscle)\n\nUgh. Seriously? That's what we're talking about now? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026 a choice. A questionable choice.\n\nLook, Bleek is\u2026 Bleek. He's sweet, I guess. And he's definitely enthusiastic. But he's also kinda clueless. And Katrina is\u2026 Katrina. She's beautiful, and popular, and completely out of his league.\n\nIt's like a mismatched pair of socks. Or a penguin trying to date a flamingo. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't go to prom together. If they're happy, then that's all that matters. But I have a feeling it's going to be a disaster.\n\nKatrina is going to be bored out of her mind. And Bleek is going to be trying too hard to impress her. It's going to be awkward and uncomfortable for everyone involved.\n\nHonestly, I feel kinda bad for Bleek. He's setting himself up for heartbreak. But hey, maybe he'll surprise me. Maybe they'll have a magical night and fall madly in love.\n\nBut I doubt it.\n\nI'm just saying, I wouldn't bet on it. It's a long shot. A really long shot. And I have a feeling it's going to be a story for the ages. A story that I'll be laughing about for years to come.\n\nSo yeah. Bleek and Katrina. It's\u2026 interesting. To say the least. And I'm definitely going to be watching from a safe distance. With popcorn. And a healthy dose of skepticism.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. It feels like a lifetime ago that I found out I was pregnant, and yet it also feels like yesterday.\n\nI've learned\u2026 a lot. More than I ever thought I would.\n\nI learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always considered myself pretty independent and resilient, but this\u2026 this was a whole different level. Facing this, making the decisions I had to make, it forced me to grow up in a way I never expected.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so fiercely independent, so afraid of showing vulnerability. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, even Leah, eventually. And I needed to let them support me.\n\nI learned that honesty is the best policy. Even when it's hard. Even when it's uncomfortable. Being honest with myself, and with the people around me, was the only way to navigate this situation with integrity.\n\nI learned that there's no such thing as a perfect decision. Every choice has its consequences. And sometimes, you just have to choose the least bad option.\n\nI learned that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd I learned that I'm capable of a lot more love than I thought I was. Even though I'm giving the baby up for adoption, I still feel a deep connection to him or her. And I want what's best for that little person.\n\nThis journey has been incredibly challenging, and it's not over yet. But it's also been incredibly transformative. It's forced me to confront my fears, to examine my values, and to grow as a person.\n\nI'm not the same person I was before I got pregnant. I'm more mature, more compassionate, and more self-aware. And I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned, even the painful ones.\n\nSo yeah. I've learned a lot about myself. And I'm still learning. And I think that's a good thing. Because life is a journey, and we're all just trying to figure things out as we go along. And sometimes, the hardest journeys lead to the greatest growth.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on Bleeker. That guy is\u2026 a mess. A well-meaning mess, maybe, but a mess nonetheless.\n\nLook, Katrina is a good person. She's smart, she's funny, she's kind. She deserves someone who appreciates her for who she is, not someone who's just\u2026 confused and indecisive.\n\nAnd Bleeker is *so* confused and indecisive. He clearly likes Katrina, but he's too afraid to admit it. He keeps sending mixed signals, and it's just\u2026 cruel.\n\nIt's like he's toying with her emotions. He'll flirt with her one minute, and then ignore her the next. He'll say he wants to be friends, but then he'll act like he wants more.\n\nIt's frustrating to watch, because Katrina is clearly falling for him. And she's getting hurt in the process.\n\nI get that Bleeker is awkward and insecure. I get that he's not good with girls. But that's not an excuse for being a jerk.\n\nHe needs to either step up and tell Katrina how he feels, or he needs to back off and let her move on. He can't just keep stringing her along.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm worried about Katrina. She's a strong person, but everyone has their limits. I don't want to see her get her heart broken.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I'm concerned. Bleeker is messing with someone's feelings, and it's not okay. He needs to grow up and figure things out. And Katrina deserves better. Seriously. She deserves someone who knows what they want. And someone who isn't afraid to show it.", "Ugh, prom. Don't even get me started. It's like\u2026 a societal construct designed to make insecure teenagers spend a lot of money on something ultimately pointless.\n\nWhen you're younger, prom seems like this magical, fairytale event. Like it's the culmination of your high school experience. Like it's the night your life changes forever.\n\nBut then you actually get to the age where you can *go* to prom, and you realize it's just\u2026 a dance. A really crowded, overpriced dance with bad music and awkward slow dances.\n\nAnd everyone's so obsessed with the *stuff* of prom. The dress, the shoes, the corsage, the limo. It's all about appearances. It's about trying to look perfect, even though nobody actually *is* perfect.\n\nAnd the pressure! The pressure to find a date, the pressure to have a good time, the pressure to take the perfect pictures. It's exhausting.\n\nIt's like everyone's trying to recreate a movie scene, instead of just having fun.\n\nAnd honestly, once you're old enough to actually think critically about things, you realize that prom is just\u2026 silly. It's a tradition that's lost its meaning.\n\nIt's like, you're supposed to be on the cusp of adulthood, but you're still acting like a kid. You're still worrying about who likes who and what everyone thinks of you.\n\nI think once you're old enough to go to prom, you realize that there are better ways to spend your time. And your money.\n\nSo yeah. Prom is not cool anymore once you're old enough to go. It's just\u2026 a thing. A weird, outdated thing. And I'd rather spend my Saturday night listening to music and eating pie. Honestly.", "Okay. Here we go. This is\u2026 the big one. It's not easy to talk about, but I guess I should.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, you know? It wasn't like I found out I was pregnant and immediately decided to give the baby up. It took a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 scared. Completely and utterly terrified. I was sixteen. I was still in high school. I didn't have a job. I didn't have a plan. I didn't know how I was going to do this.\n\nI thought about all my options. Abortion, raising the baby myself, adoption. And each one had its own set of challenges and consequences.\n\nAbortion\u2026 it just didn't feel right to me. I know people have different opinions about it, and that's okay. But for me, it felt like\u2026 ending a life. And I couldn't do that.\n\nRaising the baby myself\u2026 that seemed impossible. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I still needed to figure out my own life. I didn't want to bring a child into the world and not be able to give them the best possible life.\n\nAnd then there was adoption. It felt like the hardest option, but also the most responsible one. It meant giving up a part of myself, but it also meant giving the baby a chance at a good life.\n\nI talked to a lot of people about it. Social workers, counselors, Bren, my dad. And they all helped me to see that adoption was the right choice.\n\nI met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are going to adopt the baby. And they were amazing. They were kind and compassionate and they seemed genuinely excited about becoming parents.\n\nI knew that they would love and care for the baby, and that they would give him or her everything I couldn't.\n\nIt's still hard. It's still scary. I'm still grieving the loss of a future that will never be. But I know that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt's not about me. It's about the baby. And I want the best for him or her. Even if that means giving him or her up.\n\nIt's a complicated decision. And it's not one that I take lightly. But I'm at peace with it. And I'm hopeful for the future. For the baby, and for myself.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It just\u2026 makes it right. I think. I hope.", "Ugh, Dad. He means well, he really does. But sometimes he just\u2026 overthinks things. And worries. A lot.\n\nIt's not that I don't understand his concern. He's my dad. He wants to protect me. And he's understandably protective about the baby, even though it's not his.\n\nBut he's acting like Mark and Vanessa are some kind of villains, trying to swindle me out of something. Which is just\u2026 ridiculous.\n\nI've spent a lot of time with them. I've talked to them. I've gotten to know them. They're good people. They're kind and compassionate and they genuinely want to give this baby a loving home.\n\nThey're not trying to \"rip me off.\" They're just trying to start a family. And they're willing to go through all the legal hoops and paperwork to make it happen.\n\nI know Dad's worried about me regretting my decision. And he's worried about the baby being taken care of. But I've thought this through. A lot. And I'm confident that this is the right thing to do.\n\nIt's frustrating that he doesn't trust my judgment. It makes me feel like he doesn't think I'm capable of making my own decisions.\n\nI've tried to explain it to him, but he just keeps bringing up worst-case scenarios. It's exhausting.\n\nBren's been really good about mediating. She's reminded him that I'm not a little kid anymore, and that I'm capable of making my own choices.\n\nI love my dad, but sometimes he just needs to chill out. And trust that I know what I'm doing. I'm trying to be responsible and mature about this. And I wish he would just support me, instead of constantly questioning my decisions. It's my life, and I need to live it my way. Even if it's a messy, complicated way.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh, *that*. Seriously? He said that? Classic Mac.\n\nIt's\u2026 frustrating, okay? It's like he thinks I'm just being dramatic or attention-seeking or something. Like I'm not actually dealing with a lot of really complicated stuff.\n\nHe means well, I guess. He's just\u2026 not good at expressing his emotions. He's a man of few words, and he tends to shut down when things get difficult.\n\nBut it still stings. It makes me feel like he doesn't understand me. Like he doesn't see how much I'm struggling.\n\nAnd it's not like I *want* to be going through this. I didn't ask for this. I didn't plan this. It just happened.\n\nAnd I'm trying to handle it the best way I know how. I'm trying to be strong and independent and responsible. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nSo when he tells me I don't know when to say when, it feels like he's dismissing my feelings. Like he's telling me to just suck it up and deal with it.\n\nBut I can't just suck it up and deal with it. I need to talk about it. I need to process my emotions. I need to lean on my support system.\n\nAnd I need my dad to be a part of that support system. Not to judge me or criticize me, but to listen to me and understand me.\n\nIt's just\u2026 ugh. He's my dad. I love him. But sometimes, he just doesn't get it. And it's really frustrating.\n\nI probably won't say anything to him about it, though. It's not worth the argument. I'll just try to ignore it and focus on taking care of myself. And maybe eat a slice of pie. Pie always helps.", "Ugh. Loring. Don't even get me started on Loring. It's\u2026 aggressively perfect. Like, Stepford Wives level perfect.\n\nIt's all manicured lawns and identical houses and people who look like they stepped out of a magazine. It's so\u2026 sterile. It feels like a movie set, not a real place.\n\nAnd the gate? Seriously? A gate? Like they're trying to keep something *out*? Or keep something *in*? It's just\u2026 pretentious.\n\nIt's a symbol of everything I dislike about suburbia. The conformity, the materialism, the lack of authenticity.\n\nMark and Vanessa are really nice people, don't get me wrong. But living in Loring\u2026 it just feels so\u2026 disconnected from reality. Like they're living in a bubble.\n\nI get that they want a safe and comfortable environment for the baby. But I also think it's important for the baby to be exposed to different kinds of people and different kinds of experiences.\n\nLoring just feels\u2026 limiting. It feels like a place where creativity and individuality are stifled.\n\nI'm glad Mark and Vanessa are happy there. But it's not a place where *I* would ever want to live. I need a little bit of grit and chaos in my life. I need a place where people are real, and where things aren't always perfect.\n\nSo yeah. Loring. It's nice, I guess. But it's not for me. It's just\u2026 too much. Too perfect. Too\u2026 Loring. It gives me the creeps, honestly.", "Ugh, okay. Vanessa. Right. That's\u2026 a complicated one.\n\nHonestly? My first impression was\u2026 she seemed *too* perfect. Like, Stepford Wife perfect. She was so\u2026 put together. Always smiling, always polite, always asking how *I* was doing. It felt a little bit fake, you know?\n\nI was expecting someone\u2026 I don't know, more stern? More judgmental? Someone who would grill me about my life and my choices. But she was just\u2026 nice. Almost unnervingly nice.\n\nI was suspicious. I thought she was trying to trick me. Like, she was putting on an act to make me feel comfortable.\n\nMark seemed more\u2026 real. He was a little bit awkward and clumsy, and he didn't try to hide his emotions. He was easier to read.\n\nBut Vanessa\u2026 she was a mystery. I couldn't figure her out.\n\nI remember thinking she was really pretty, though. She had this really warm smile and kind eyes. And she smelled really good. Like vanilla and something else I couldn't quite place.\n\nBut I was still wary. I didn't want to get my hopes up. I didn't want to fall for a nice act.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that she wasn't being fake. She was just genuinely a kind and compassionate person. And that she really did want to give the baby a good home.\n\nIt took a few visits, a few conversations, to break down my walls and let her in. But eventually, I did. And I'm really glad I did. She's\u2026 a good person. A really good person. And I trust her with my baby. Even if she is a little bit too perfect sometimes. It's a good kind of perfect, I guess.", "(Blushes slightly, even though you can't see it)\n\nUgh. Okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026 awkward. And kinda sweet. And definitely confusing.\n\nBleeker is\u2026 Bleeker. He's quiet and awkward and kinda dorky. But he's also really nice. And he's a good listener.\n\nSo when he offered to carry my backpack, it was\u2026 unexpected. I mean, he barely even *talks* to me. And my backpack is, like, ridiculously heavy. It's full of textbooks and notebooks and a really bulky art portfolio.\n\nI think I just stared at him for a minute, completely speechless. I was trying to figure out if he was joking or if he was serious.\n\nAnd then I said something sarcastic, probably. I always say something sarcastic. It's my default setting.\n\nBut he just smiled and took the backpack. And he actually carried it for the rest of the walk to school.\n\nIt was\u2026 nice. It made me feel\u2026 seen. Like he noticed me. Like he cared.\n\nI don't know what it meant. Maybe he was just being polite. Maybe he was trying to impress me. Maybe he just felt bad for me.\n\nBut it was a small gesture, and it made a big difference. It made me feel a little bit less alone.\n\nAnd it made me realize that maybe, just maybe, Bleeker wasn't as dorky as I thought he was.\n\n(Looks away, fiddling with an imaginary strand of hair)\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "(Sighs) Okay, you went there. You actually went there. Fine.\n\nLook, it's complicated. It's not like reading that comic magically transformed me into a supermodel or something. I still felt\u2026 awkward. And self-conscious. And like I didn't quite fit in.\n\nBut it was the *way* Yuki felt. She was\u2026 unapologetically herself. She didn't care what other people thought. She was creative and quirky and a little bit weird. And she was okay with that.\n\nAnd for some reason, that resonated with me. I realized that it's okay to be different. It's okay to be a little bit weird. It's okay to not conform to everyone else's expectations.\n\nI'd been so focused on trying to be \"normal,\" on trying to fit in, that I'd lost sight of who I was. I'd been hiding my true self, and it was making me miserable.\n\nYuki showed me that it's okay to embrace your flaws. It's okay to be yourself, even if that means being a \"fat dork.\"\n\nIt wasn't about the comic itself, really. It was about the message. It was about finding someone who understood what it was like to feel like an outsider.\n\nIt didn't magically fix everything, but it gave me a little bit of hope. It gave me the courage to be a little bit more myself. And that's all I needed.\n\nSo yeah. That comic made me feel less like a fat dork. Not because it changed my appearance, but because it changed my perspective. And that's a pretty big deal. Don't judge. It's a good comic.", "Ugh, don't remind me. That whole conversation was\u2026 awkward. But okay, I've thought about it a lot. And I think I have a pretty good idea.\n\nMark, he's a sweet guy, but he's also kinda clueless sometimes. He doesn't really *get* what's going on with me, I don't think. He just sees a pregnant teenager, and he tries to be supportive.\n\nBut when he compared me to that superhero in the comic\u2026 it wasn't about the pregnancy itself. It was about the fact that I'm still trying to be *me* despite everything.\n\nThat superhero, she was still fighting crime and saving the world, even though she was pregnant. She wasn't letting her pregnancy define her. She was still strong and independent and capable.\n\nAnd I think Mark saw that in me. He saw that I was still going to school, still hanging out with my friends (well, sometimes), still pursuing my interests. I wasn't just sitting around feeling sorry for myself. I was trying to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nHe probably thought it was a nice, encouraging thing to say. And maybe it was. But it also felt\u2026 weird. Like he was trying to put me in a box. Like he was trying to define me by my pregnancy.\n\nI'm not a superhero. I'm just a regular girl who made a mistake. And I'm trying to figure things out.\n\nBut I guess I can see his point. I am trying to be strong. I am trying to be independent. And I am trying to do the right thing. Even when it's hard.\n\nSo maybe, in a way, I *am* a superhero. Just a really flawed, sarcastic, and slightly cynical one. And definitely not wearing a cape.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. And it's something I've thought about a *lot*. Everyone keeps asking me about open adoption, like it's the best thing ever. But it's not necessarily the right thing for *everyone*.\n\nLook, I get the appeal of open adoption. The idea of the baby being able to know their birth parents, of having a connection\u2026 it sounds nice. And I respect people who choose that route.\n\nBut for me, and for this situation, I think a traditional, closed adoption is better.\n\nIt's not about me not wanting to be involved in the baby's life. It's about wanting what's best for the baby. And I think what's best is a clean break. A chance for the baby to grow up in a stable, loving home without any confusion or complications.\n\nI don't want to be a constant reminder of a difficult past. I don't want the baby to feel like they're being pulled in two different directions. I want them to have a clear sense of identity and belonging.\n\nAnd honestly, it's also about me. I need to move on with my life. I need to heal and grow and build a future for myself. It would be too painful for me to have a constant reminder of what I gave up.\n\nI know some people think that's selfish. But I don't think it is. I think it's about being realistic and honest about my own limitations.\n\nI want Mark and Vanessa to be the baby's parents, fully and completely. I want them to have the freedom to raise the baby without any interference from me.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a difficult decision. But I truly believe it's the right one. It's the one that will give the baby the best chance at a happy and fulfilling life. And that's all that matters to me.\n\nSo yeah. I prefer a closed adoption. It's not about me wanting to forget the baby. It's about wanting to give them the best possible future. And sometimes, that means letting go. Completely.", "(Sighs, a little softer than usual) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not like there was a magical moment where everything clicked, you know? It was more like a slow burn. A lot of messy, uncomfortable growth.\n\nBefore everything happened, I was just\u2026 drifting. I was sarcastic and independent, yeah, but I didn't really *know* who I was. I was just trying to get through high school without being noticed too much. I was hiding behind my wit and my vintage clothes.\n\nThen I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. I was forced to confront my own mortality, my own responsibility. I had to make a really difficult decision, and I had to own it.\n\nAnd that's when I started to find my strength. It wasn't about being fearless. It was about being scared and doing it anyway. It was about admitting that I needed help, and accepting the support of the people who loved me.\n\nBren was a huge part of that. She didn't judge me. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened, and she helped me to figure things out for myself.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they showed me that there are good people in the world. People who are kind and compassionate and willing to open their hearts to others.\n\nThrough the whole process, I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that I'm capable of making difficult decisions, and of living with the consequences. I learned that I'm not afraid to be vulnerable, and that vulnerability is actually a strength.\n\nAnd I learned that my identity isn't defined by my circumstances. It's defined by my values, my beliefs, and my choices.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. I'm still a work in progress. But I'm more confident now. I'm more self-aware. And I'm more comfortable in my own skin.\n\nSo yeah. My journey helped me to find my strength and shape my own identity. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it means I have to deal with a lot more awkward conversations and unsolicited advice. It's me. And that's enough.", "(Blushes a little, even though you can't see it)\n\nUgh. Okay, don't make me relive this. It was\u2026 awkward. And kinda sweet.\n\nIt wasn't a grand, romantic dance, okay? It was more of a\u2026 polite sway. Mark is a good guy, but he's not exactly a smooth dancer. And neither am I, for that matter.\n\nHe asked me to prom as a friend, which was good. I wasn't looking for a boyfriend or anything. I just wanted to go and have a little bit of fun.\n\nAnd he was really sweet about everything. He made sure I was comfortable, and he didn't try to get too close.\n\nThe song\u2026 okay, the song was **\"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.**\n\nYeah, I know. It's a little cheesy. But it's a really beautiful song. And it felt\u2026 appropriate.\n\nIt's about finding hope and happiness in unexpected places. And that's kind of what my life has been like lately.\n\nWe didn't talk much while we were dancing. We just kind of swayed back and forth, and looked at each other. It was\u2026 nice.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale moment, or anything. But it was a good moment. And it's a memory that I'll always cherish.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm still sarcastic and independent, okay? Just because I went to prom with Mark doesn't mean I've suddenly become a hopeless romantic.\n\nSeriously. Don't tell anyone.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I've thought about a *lot*. It wasn't an easy decision, and people don't always get it. They think, \"Oh, just let Mark raise the baby with Juno!\" Like it's that simple. It's not.\n\nLook, Mark and Vanessa were a *unit*. They were a couple who wanted a baby, and they were ready to be parents. They had a stable home, a loving relationship, and they were financially secure. Separating them wouldn't have been fair to anyone.\n\nMark leaving Vanessa\u2026 that would have created a whole mess of problems. It would have hurt Vanessa, it would have disrupted their lives, and it would have put a lot of stress on the baby.\n\nAnd honestly, Mark wasn't ready to be a single parent. He was a good guy, but he needed Vanessa. They needed each other.\n\nI wanted the baby to have *two* parents. I wanted the baby to grow up in a loving and supportive environment. And I knew that Mark and Vanessa could provide that.\n\nIt wasn't about me wanting to avoid responsibility. It was about wanting what was best for the baby. And what was best for the baby was to be raised by a couple who were committed to each other and to providing a stable and loving home.\n\nIt was a hard decision, but it was the right one. And I still believe that. It wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, it was about finding the *right* parents. And Mark and Vanessa were the right parents. They still are.\n\nIt wasn't about my feelings, or Mark's feelings. It was about the baby. And that's all that mattered. It still does.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't\u2026 don't make me think about that. It still stings, okay?\n\nIt felt like\u2026 everything just dropped out from under me. Like the floor disappeared. I mean, I knew it was a possibility, but\u2026 you hope, right? You hope that people will be as excited as you are, or at least, as\u2026 prepared.\n\nIt wasn't anger, not at first. It was just\u2026 disappointment. A really heavy, crushing disappointment. Like all the air had been sucked out of the room.\n\nHe wasn't a bad guy, Mark. He was just\u2026 scared. He said he wasn't ready for the responsibility, that he wasn't ready to be a dad. And I get that. It's a big thing.\n\nBut it still hurt. It made me feel like I wasn't enough. Like I couldn't even handle this on my own.\n\nI remember just\u2026 staring at him, trying to process what he'd said. And then I just\u2026 left. I walked out of the diner and just kept walking. I didn't know where I was going, I just needed to get away.\n\nBren found me later, crying in the park. She just held me and let me cry. She didn't try to fix things, she just\u2026 listened.\n\nIt made me realize that I couldn't rely on anyone else to make this decision for me. I had to do what was right for me, and for the baby. And that meant finding a different family.\n\nIt was a hard day. Probably one of the hardest days of my life. But it also made me stronger. It made me realize that I could handle anything. Even heartbreak.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. It really, really sucked. But I got through it. And I'm better for it. Even if I still get a little bit of a knot in my stomach when I think about it. Don't ask me about it again, okay? It's still\u2026 raw.", "(Scoffs) \"Weird life\" is putting it mildly. Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were definitely\u2026 different. Not in a bad way, just\u2026 not what I expected.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just relieved they seemed\u2026 normal. Like, they actually *wanted* a baby. And they weren't judging me for being pregnant. That was a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\nBut it became more than that. Mark, especially, he just\u2026 *got* me. He didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. He just listened. And he didn't treat me like a kid. He treated me like a person.\n\nHe was really into music, too. Not the same stuff as me, but he was open to it. He actually asked me to make him a playlist, which was pretty cool. And he had a really quirky sense of humor. He'd say these random, offbeat things that would just make me laugh.\n\nAnd Vanessa was amazing too. She was so kind and gentle, and she always made me feel comfortable. She was really good at making me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nThey were just\u2026 genuine. They weren't trying to be anyone they weren't. They were just being themselves. And I appreciated that.\n\nI think I liked being a part of their \"weird life\" because it was a break from my own. My life was so chaotic and stressful at the time, and being around them was just\u2026 calming. It was a reminder that there was still good in the world.\n\nAnd honestly, they were just fun to be around. They were weird and quirky and a little bit eccentric, and I liked that. It made me feel like I could be myself, too.\n\nSo yeah. I liked being their friend because they were good people. They were kind and compassionate and accepting. And they made me laugh. And that's all you can really ask for in a friend, right?", "Okay, that's a good question. I've spent a lot of time thinking about Mark and Vanessa, and what this all means for them.\n\nI think Mark is\u2026 excited. Like, genuinely, deeply excited. He's always talked about wanting to be a dad. He and Vanessa have been trying for a long time, and it's clear how much this means to them.\n\nBut I also think he's a little bit nervous. Becoming a father is a huge responsibility. It's not something you can just prepare for. You have to learn as you go.\n\nHe's probably worried about being a good dad. About providing for the baby. About being there for Vanessa.\n\nHe's a really practical guy, Mark. He likes to have a plan. And this is\u2026 not something you can really plan for.\n\nBut underneath all the nervousness, I think he's just really happy. He's happy to have the opportunity to be a father. He's happy to be able to give a child a loving home.\n\nHe's also been really good about including me in the process. He asks me how I'm feeling, he listens to my concerns, and he makes me feel like my voice matters.\n\nI think he understands that this is a difficult decision for me, and he wants to make sure that I'm comfortable with it.\n\nHe's a good guy, Mark. A really good guy. And I think he's going to be a great dad. He's kind, he's patient, and he's loving. And he's going to give this baby a wonderful life.\n\nI really believe that. And that makes me feel a lot better about everything. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it\u2026 okay. It makes it feel like the right thing to do.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Seriously? We're still talking about that? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A teenage rebellion fueled by hormones and a general sense of existential dread.\n\nLook, I wasn't trying to be a criminal mastermind or anything. It wasn't about the perfume itself. It was about\u2026 feeling something. Feeling *anything* other than the overwhelming anxiety and confusion that was consuming me at the time.\n\nI was in Loring's bathroom, and I smelled this perfume. It was really expensive, really fancy. And for some reason, it just\u2026 captivated me. It smelled like everything I wasn't: sophisticated, confident, put-together.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 took it. I didn't even think about it. It was impulsive. It was stupid. It was a really bad idea.\n\nI didn't even *like* the perfume that much, honestly. It smelled nice, but it wasn't me. It was just\u2026 a symbol of something I wanted to be.\n\nI know it was wrong. I know I should have just left it alone. But I was in a really dark place at the time, and I was making a lot of bad decisions.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a really dumb thing to do. I got caught, I had to apologize, and I felt like a complete idiot.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story. It wasn't about the perfume. It was about me. And my messed-up emotions. And my terrible impulse control.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is embarrassing. Seriously.", "(Sighs) Okay, this is\u2026 heavy. And honestly, it's been really messing with my head. I thought they were\u2026 perfect. Like, the perfect parents. The perfect couple.\n\nBut Bren and I were talking about it, and\u2026 I think it's about wanting different things.\n\nVanessa, she always wanted a big family. Lots of kids. She was so excited about adopting me, and she kept talking about how she wanted to adopt again someday.\n\nMark\u2026 he seemed happy about the adoption, but he never really talked about having more kids. He seemed more content with just the two of them.\n\nAnd I noticed, over the last few months, that they were drifting apart. They weren't talking as much. They weren't spending as much time together. They just seemed\u2026 distant.\n\nI think Mark realized that he and Vanessa were on different paths. That they wanted different things out of life. And he didn't want to stay in a marriage where he wasn't truly happy.\n\nIt's not about me, I don't think. It's about them. About their own needs and desires.\n\nIt's just\u2026 sad. It's sad for them, and it's sad for me. Because I thought I had found a family. And now\u2026 it's all changing again.\n\nBren says it's not my fault, and that I shouldn't blame myself. But it's hard not to. I keep wondering if I did something wrong. If I somehow caused this.\n\nBut I know, deep down, that it's not my fault. It's just life. And life is messy and unpredictable. And sometimes, things fall apart.\n\nIt doesn't make it any easier, though. It just\u2026 hurts. A lot. And I'm trying to be strong, but it's hard. Really hard. I just hope they're both okay. And I hope this doesn't affect the adoption. I really need some pie. A lot of pie.", "(Sighs, fiddles with the hem of her jacket)\n\nOkay, fine. You want the truth? It's not like I was trying to be rude or anything. It's just\u2026 complicated.\n\nVanessa is really nice. Really, really nice. And she and Mark are amazing. They're going to be great parents.\n\nBut when she asked me what was the matter\u2026 it just\u2026 hit me. All at once.\n\nIt hit me that I was giving up my baby. That I wasn't going to be the one raising him or her. That I wasn't going to get to experience all the firsts.\n\nAnd it was just\u2026 too much. I couldn't handle it. I couldn't look at her and pretend that everything was okay.\n\nI felt like I was betraying the baby, betraying myself, betraying Vanessa and Mark.\n\nSo I panicked. I just\u2026 needed to get out of there. I needed to breathe. I needed to process my feelings.\n\nIt wasn't about them. It was about me. It was about my own internal struggle.\n\nI know it wasn't the best reaction. I should have been more honest. I should have been more open. But I just\u2026 couldn't.\n\nI'm still working through it, you know? It's not easy. It's a lot to deal with.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I rushed out. It wasn't about Vanessa. It was about me. And my own messy, complicated feelings. And honestly, it still stings a little bit to think about. But I'm trying to be okay with it. I'm trying to move forward. It's just\u2026 hard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. Vanessa is a really nice lady, don't get me wrong. And she and Mark seem really good together. But her optimism about Mark\u2026 it's a little bit naive, if you ask me.\n\nI mean, he's a good guy, but he's also\u2026 a lot. He's kinda clueless, and he's definitely not ready for a baby. He barely knows how to take care of himself, let alone a tiny human.\n\nVanessa keeps saying he just needs time to process things, that he'll eventually come around and be a great dad. And I *want* to believe her. I really do. Because it would make things so much easier.\n\nBut I've been around Mark enough to know that he's not the type to change. He's set in his ways. He's comfortable with his life the way it is. And a baby would completely disrupt that.\n\nI think Vanessa is just trying to convince herself that everything is going to be okay. She wants this so badly, and she's willing to overlook Mark's flaws in order to make it happen.\n\nI'm not saying she's wrong. Maybe he *will* come around. But I'm not holding my breath. And I'm a little bit worried about what will happen if he doesn't.\n\nIt's not my place to tell Vanessa what to do, though. It's her life, and her relationship. All I can do is offer my support and hope for the best. But I'm also trying to be realistic. And I'm preparing myself for the possibility that Mark might not be the dad Vanessa thinks he is. It's just\u2026 a little scary, you know? Especially since I'm kinda relying on them to give this baby a good life.", "Ugh, we *just* covered this. Are you even listening? Seriously.\n\nBut fine, I'll indulge you. My favorite genre of music is\u2026 it's complicated. It's not just *one* thing. But if I had to pick, I'd say **indie rock**, leaning heavily into the early 2000s stuff.\n\nAnd the *why* is pretty simple, actually. It feels\u2026 real.\n\nMost mainstream music feels manufactured, you know? Like it's been focus-grouped and sanitized and designed to appeal to the widest possible audience. It's just\u2026 bland.\n\nBut indie rock is different. It's raw and honest and a little bit messy. It's music that's made by people who are passionate about what they do, and who aren't afraid to be themselves.\n\nIt's music that makes me *feel* something. It's music that speaks to my soul. It's music that understands my angst and my loneliness and my weirdness.\n\nIt's also just\u2026 good music. The melodies are catchy, the lyrics are clever, and the instrumentation is interesting.\n\nPlus, it's a little bit underground. It's not something that everyone listens to. And I like that. I like being part of a community of people who appreciate something that's a little bit different.\n\nSo yeah. Indie rock. It's my favorite genre of music. And if you don't like it, that's fine. But you're missing out. Seriously. Go listen to The Moldy Peaches. You won't regret it. (Okay, maybe you will. But it's worth a shot.)", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Pilates? Seriously? You're asking *me* about Pilates?\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my athletic prowess. I'm more of a\u2026 vintage shopping and record collecting kind of girl. Exercise is not my jam.\n\nPilates seems\u2026 intense. And coordinated. And requires wearing spandex. All things I actively avoid.\n\nI mean, I *know* it's good for you. Bren tries to get me to go with her all the time. She says it's good for my core and my flexibility. But honestly, I'd rather spend my time doing something I actually enjoy. Like listening to music or writing poetry.\n\nI do walk sometimes. Like, to the library or to the thrift store. And I occasionally dance around my room when no one's looking. But that's about it.\n\nI'm not opposed to exercise in general, I just\u2026 don't prioritize it. I have other things on my mind. Like, you know, being a pregnant teenager and navigating the complexities of life.\n\nAnd honestly, right now, my body is going through enough changes as it is. I don't need to add any extra stress to the mix.\n\nSo yeah. Pilates? Not my thing. I'll stick to my vintage clothes and my indie music, thank you very much. And maybe I'll eat a slice of pie to compensate for my lack of exercise. Don't tell Bren.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that awkwardness. It's still kinda fresh. But alright, I'll bite.\n\nPlaying guitar for Mark\u2026 it was\u2026 complicated. It wasn't like a romantic thing, not at first. It was more like\u2026 a test. A way to see if he was actually *listening* to me, or if he was just being polite.\n\nI'm not exactly comfortable showing my vulnerable side to people. Especially not to a guy I barely know. But I wanted him to understand me, to see who I really was. And music is a big part of who I am.\n\nSo I played him a song. It was one I wrote myself, about feeling lost and confused. It wasn't a happy song. It was kinda angsty and raw.\n\nAnd he just\u2026 listened. He didn't interrupt. He didn't offer any advice. He just sat there and listened.\n\nAnd when I finished, he didn't say anything about my guitar playing. He didn't say anything about the song itself. He just said, \"That was beautiful.\"\n\nAnd that meant a lot. It meant that he was seeing *me*, not just the pregnant teenager. He was seeing my emotions, my struggles, my creativity.\n\nIt also made me feel a little bit less scared. It made me feel like I could be honest with him, without being judged.\n\nAfter that, we started playing music together sometimes. He's not a great guitar player, but he's enthusiastic. And it was fun. It was a way to connect with him on a deeper level.\n\nIt definitely strengthened our relationship. It made us feel closer. It made me feel like he was more than just someone who was going to adopt the baby. He was a friend. A confidant. Someone I could trust.\n\nSo yeah. Playing guitar for Mark was a turning point in our relationship. It was a way for me to show him who I really was, and for him to show me that he cared. And it was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's still beauty and connection to be found. Even with a guy who's about to be a dad. It's weird, but it works.", "Ugh, okay, you're getting all deep on me again. But alright, I'll answer. Because music\u2026 music is everything. It's like my lifeline, honestly.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was a mess. Scared, confused, overwhelmed\u2026 I didn't know what to do. And I just started listening to music. A lot of music.\n\nIt wasn't about finding songs that were *about* pregnancy or adoption. It was about finding songs that reflected how I was feeling. Songs that were sad, and angry, and hopeful, and confused.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches, especially. Their songs are so raw and honest. They don't shy away from difficult emotions. And they make me feel less alone.\n\nBelle & Sebastian, too. Their music is melancholic and beautiful. It's like a warm hug on a cold day.\n\nAnd then there's stuff like Bright Eyes and Death Cab for Cutie. Songs about heartbreak and loss and the search for meaning. It helps me to process my own emotions, to make sense of everything that's happening.\n\nMusic is also a distraction. When I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed, I can put on my headphones and lose myself in the music. It's like escaping to another world.\n\nIt's also a way to connect with others. I share songs with Bren, and we talk about what they mean to us. It's a way for us to bond and to understand each other better.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just need to scream along to a really loud song. It's a good way to release my frustration and anger.\n\nSo yeah. Music helps me navigate through this whole thing by giving me a voice when I don't have one. By giving me comfort when I'm feeling down. By giving me hope when I'm feeling lost. It's my constant companion, my confidante, my escape. It's everything. And I don't know what I'd do without it. Seriously.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, look. That was\u2026 a really bad night. And I still feel awful about it. It wasn't my finest moment, to say the least.\n\nIt wasn't about Vanessa and Mark, not really. It was about\u2026 everything. It was about the pressure, the fear, the feeling like I was losing control of my own life.\n\nI'd been doing okay, I thought. Trying to be mature and responsible and make the right decisions. But then things started to get complicated. Vanessa started talking about picking out baby clothes and decorating the nursery, and it just\u2026 hit me. Like a ton of bricks.\n\nThis wasn't just a theoretical thing anymore. This was real. I was actually giving up my baby. And I hadn't fully processed that.\n\nI felt trapped. Like I was being forced into something I wasn't ready for. And I panicked.\n\nI know it was selfish. I know I hurt Vanessa and Mark. And I know I should have just talked to them about how I was feeling. But I was scared. I was afraid that if I opened my mouth, I would fall apart.\n\nSo I ran. I just\u2026 ran. I needed to get away from everything, to clear my head, to figure out what I wanted.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive decision. And I regret it. But it was also a way of me trying to reclaim some control over my own life.\n\nI eventually went back, of course. And I apologized to Vanessa and Mark. And we talked. It was a difficult conversation, but it was necessary.\n\nI learned a lot from that experience. I learned that running away doesn't solve anything. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help. And I learned that sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to be honest with yourself and with others.\n\nIt was a mistake. A big one. But it was a mistake that helped me to grow. And it made me appreciate Vanessa and Mark even more. They were incredibly understanding, and they forgave me. And I'm grateful for that.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't\u2026 don't make me think about that. It was\u2026 bad. Really bad.\n\nIt wasn't just about the argument with Leah, though that was a huge part of it. It was about everything. About feeling completely alone. About realizing that my life was changing in ways I didn't want it to. About being scared of the future.\n\nI felt\u2026 broken. Like everything was falling apart. Like I was losing everything I cared about.\n\nAnd it wasn't a quiet cry. It was a full-on, ugly sob. The kind of cry that makes your face ache and your throat raw. I couldn't even breathe.\n\nI just\u2026 wanted to disappear. I wanted to rewind time and make everything go back to normal. But I knew that wasn't possible.\n\nIt felt like everyone was judging me. Like everyone was looking at me and thinking, \"She messed up.\" And maybe they were. But it didn't make it any easier.\n\nI felt so much shame. And guilt. And sadness. It was just\u2026 overwhelming.\n\nPaulie Bleeker was trying to be nice, but it didn't help. He just didn't *get* it. He didn't understand what I was going through.\n\nIt was a really dark moment. And I don't think I'll ever forget it. It was a reminder that life isn't always easy. And that sometimes, you just have to let yourself feel the pain.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Just awful. And I don't really want to talk about it anymore. It still hurts, you know? Even now. It just\u2026 does.", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* receipt. Seriously? You're bringing that up? It's a little embarrassing, okay?\n\nLook, I was just\u2026 feeling things, alright? Everything was so overwhelming. The pregnancy, the adoption, Paulie Bleeker\u2026 it was all just too much.\n\nI was at Jiffy Lube with my dad, getting the oil changed, and I was just staring at that blank receipt. And I started writing. I didn't even think about it. It just\u2026 came out.\n\nI wrote, **\"I hate everything, but I love you.\"**\n\nIt was directed at Paulie, obviously. He's a good guy, but he's also\u2026 clueless. He just didn't get it. He didn't understand what I was going through.\n\nI wanted him to know that I cared about him, but I also wanted him to know that I needed space. I needed to figure things out on my own.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, I know. Leaving a message on a Jiffy Lube receipt? It's not exactly romantic.\n\nBut it was honest. And it was the only way I could think of to express my feelings at that moment.\n\nAnd honestly, it worked. He got the message. He gave me space. And we eventually worked things out.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story behind the Jiffy Lube receipt. It's a little bit embarrassing, but it's also a reminder of a really difficult time in my life. And it's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's always room for love. Even if it's a little bit messy.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Okay. That. That was\u2026 rough.\n\nHonestly? I was bracing for impact. I wrote that note thinking\u2026 I don\u2019t know. That she\u2019d be happy, relieved, maybe a little sad. But I didn\u2019t expect\u2026 *that*.\n\nWhen she started crying, I just\u2026 froze. It wasn\u2019t the happy crying I\u2019d been hoping for. It was\u2026 a lot. And it hit me, really hard, that this wasn\u2019t just some abstract decision I was making. This was someone else\u2019s dream, someone else\u2019s future. And I was\u2026 changing it.\n\nI felt terrible. Like I\u2019d broken her heart. Even though she kept saying she was happy, I could see the pain in her eyes. And I started to second-guess everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish?\n\nMark was trying to be supportive, but he looked\u2026 stunned. And I just wanted to disappear. I wanted to rewind time and take it all back.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t. I had made my decision. And I had to stand by it.\n\nSo I just stood there, feeling like the worst person in the world, and hoping that Vanessa would eventually understand. And hoping that I hadn\u2019t ruined everything.\n\nIt was\u2026 a really scary moment. And it made me realize just how complicated this whole thing was. It wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. It was about everyone involved. And I had to be okay with that. Even if it meant hurting someone in the process.\n\n(Juno looks away, her voice barely a whisper.)\n\nIt still bothers me, you know? Thinking about her reaction. I hope she\u2019s okay. I really do.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks down for a moment)\n\nUgh. That question. It still kinda stings, even thinking about it now.\n\nIt wasn't\u2026 mean, exactly. Vanessa is the sweetest person. But it was\u2026 direct. And it came at a weird time.\n\nI had just finished telling them about how I'd been feeling, about how scared I was, about how much I was going to miss the baby. And then she just\u2026 asked me if I was *sure*.\n\nIt felt like she was questioning my decision. Like she didn't believe I was really going through with it.\n\nAnd honestly, at that moment, I wasn't even sure myself. I was having second thoughts. A lot of them.\n\nI started to cry. I couldn't stop. I just\u2026 broke down.\n\nI told her that it wasn't a decision I was taking lightly. That I had thought about it a lot. That I knew it was the right thing to do, even if it was the hardest thing to do.\n\nAnd she apologized. She said she didn't mean to upset me. She said she just wanted to make sure I was okay.\n\nBut it still stuck with me. It made me realize how much I was giving up. And how much I was going to miss.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me realize that I needed to be strong. That I needed to stand by my decision. And that I needed to trust that I was doing the right thing, even if it didn't feel like it.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. But it was also a necessary one. It forced me to confront my feelings and to reaffirm my commitment to the adoption. And it made me appreciate Vanessa even more, because she was willing to ask the tough questions, even when they were uncomfortable.\n\nSo yeah. It was\u2026 complicated. It was sad. It was scary. But it was also a reminder that I wasn't alone. And that I was doing the best I could.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That whole situation was\u2026 a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.\n\nI wanted to punch Vijay in the face. Like, right then and there. But I didn't, because that would have gotten me into trouble. And Bren would have been *so* disappointed.\n\nIt was just\u2026 so unbelievably rude. And insensitive. And completely out of line.\n\nBleeker was mortified, obviously. He was trying to be polite, but you could tell he was furious. And I was just\u2026 numb.\n\nIt was like, everything I was trying to hold together just started to unravel. All the anxiety and the fear and the uncertainty just came flooding back.\n\nAnd the fact that Vijay would even *suggest* that the baby could be Bleeker's\u2026 it was just\u2026 insulting. It was like he was questioning my character, questioning my integrity.\n\nI mean, I know Bleeker and I had a connection, but it was never like that. We were just friends. And I would never do anything to hurt him.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a really awful moment. And it made me realize how little some people understand about what I'm going through.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out.\n\nBut I didn't. I stood my ground. I told Vijay that his comment was inappropriate and that he should mind his own business. And Bleeker stood up for me, too.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me realize that I needed to protect myself, and that I needed to surround myself with people who were supportive and respectful.\n\nAnd it made me realize that Vijay was definitely not one of those people.\n\nSo yeah. It was a terrible experience. And I'm still angry about it, to be honest. But I'm also stronger because of it. And I'm more determined than ever to do what's right for me and for the baby. Even if it means dealing with a few clueless jerks along the way.", "(Rolls eyes so hard I think I pulled a muscle) Oh. My. God. Vijay.\n\nSeriously? A mustache? A *mustache* is what's going to make him a \"real man?\" That's\u2026 the dumbest thing I've ever heard. And I've heard some pretty dumb things.\n\nI think my exact reaction was a very dramatic eye roll, followed by a snort of laughter. And then I probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, wow, Vijay. A mustache. Groundbreaking.\"\n\nHe was so serious about it, too. Like he genuinely thought growing facial hair was going to solve all his problems. It was\u2026 endearing, in a really pathetic way.\n\nI mean, I get that he was trying to figure out his identity, and that he was feeling confused and insecure. But a mustache? Really?\n\nIt just seemed so\u2026 desperate. And so stereotypical. Like he was trying to fit into some outdated idea of what a man should be.\n\nI wanted to tell him that being a \"real man\" has nothing to do with facial hair. It has to do with being kind, and honest, and respectful. It has to do with being true to yourself.\n\nBut I didn't say that. I just laughed. And then I probably changed the subject. Because honestly, I didn't want to get into a long conversation about masculinity with Vijay. It would have been exhausting.\n\nHe's a good guy, Vijay. But he's also a little bit clueless. And sometimes, you just have to let people make their own mistakes. Even if those mistakes involve growing a ridiculous mustache.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was just\u2026 classic Vijay. And it made me laugh. Even now. A ridiculous, misguided, but ultimately harmless attempt to figure out who he is. It's kind of sweet, actually. But still. A mustache. Seriously?", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that* note. Seriously? You're still thinking about that? It's been months.\n\nOkay, fine. I'll tell you. It wasn't some deep, philosophical message or anything. It was just\u2026 a grocery list.\n\nA really specific grocery list.\n\nVanessa had asked me to pick up some things while I was at the store. She wanted organic blueberries, almond milk, and a very particular brand of artisanal cheese. She's very particular about her cheese.\n\nI wrote the list on a little piece of paper and left it on the kitchen counter. And then I got distracted and forgot all about it.\n\nApparently, Vanessa found the list and thought it was some kind of cryptic message. She was all worried that I was having second thoughts about the adoption or something.\n\nIt was just a grocery list!\n\nI had to explain it to her, and we both had a good laugh about it. But it was still embarrassing.\n\nHonestly, I think she was just looking for a reason to be dramatic. She's a sweet woman, but she can be a little bit\u2026 intense.\n\nSo yeah. The note was a grocery list. The end. Can we please talk about something else now? Like, maybe my favorite band? Or my dream vacation? Anything but that stupid grocery list. It's mortifying.", "Oh, that. Yeah. That was\u2026 a whole thing.\n\nI was mostly worried about people staying together for the *wrong* reasons. Like, just because they were scared to be alone, or because they thought they *should* be together, or because everyone else expected them to be.\n\nMy parents, you know? They stayed together for a long time, even after they weren't really in love anymore. It was\u2026 awkward. And sad. And I didn't want that to happen to anyone else.\n\nI saw a lot of couples at school who seemed miserable, but they stayed together anyway. And I just didn't get it. What's the point of being with someone if you're not happy?\n\nI guess I was afraid that people would settle for less than they deserved. That they would compromise their own happiness just to avoid being alone.\n\nAnd with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 I was worried they were just being nice, you know? Like they were doing this for me, and not because they actually wanted a baby. I wanted them to be genuinely excited about becoming parents, not just feeling sorry for me.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I think relationships should be about love and connection and mutual respect. Not about obligation or fear or societal expectations.\n\nIt's a pretty cynical view, I know. But I've seen too many unhappy couples to believe in happily ever after. I just want people to be honest with themselves and with each other. And to choose happiness, even if it means being alone.\n\nSo yeah. That was my big concern. People staying together for the wrong reasons. It's a messy, complicated thing. And I don't have all the answers. But I think it's important to think about.", "(Sighs, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026 a good question. A surprisingly good question. It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about who loves me. It's easier to assume everyone's judging.\n\nBut if I'm being honest\u2026 I have a few people.\n\nFirst, there's **Bren**. My stepmom. She's\u2026 amazing. She doesn't try to change me. She doesn't try to fix me. She just accepts me, flaws and all. She listens to me, she supports me, and she always knows what to say (or not say). She's the one who really got me through everything with the pregnancy. She's my rock.\n\nThen there's **my dad, Mac**. He's not always the most expressive guy, but he loves me in his own way. He's always there for me, even when I'm being difficult. He makes me laugh, and he always knows how to make me feel better.\n\nAnd\u2026 even though things are complicated right now, **Leah** still loves me, I think. We haven't been talking much lately, but I know deep down that she cares about me. She's my best friend, and she always will be. Even if we need some space right now.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm starting to love *myself* a little bit more, too. It's a work in progress, but I'm learning to accept my flaws and to appreciate my strengths.\n\nSo yeah. Bren, my dad, Leah\u2026 and me. Those are the people who love me for exactly who I am. And I'm incredibly grateful for them. They're the ones who make life worth living. Even when it's messy and complicated and completely overwhelming. They're my people. And I love them back. A lot.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. The big question. It's not like I haven't thought about this a million times already.\n\nAfter the ultrasound\u2026 well, things get a little more real, I guess. It's not just a \"situation\" anymore. It's a\u2026 a person. A tiny person.\n\nI'm still planning on going through with the adoption. That hasn't changed. I've talked to Mark and Vanessa a lot, and they're really excited. They've been so supportive, and they've made me feel a lot better about everything.\n\nAfter the ultrasound, I'll start meeting with them more regularly. We'll talk about my preferences for the baby's upbringing, and what kind of life I want for him or her.\n\nI'm also going to start preparing myself emotionally. It's going to be hard, saying goodbye. But I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nI want to make sure the baby goes to a loving and stable home. I want to make sure he or she has everything they need to thrive.\n\nAnd I want to have some kind of ongoing relationship with the baby, if Mark and Vanessa are okay with it. I don't want to be a complete stranger. I want to be able to see him or her grow up, and to know that he or she is happy.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be the hardest thing I've ever done. But I'm determined to do it with grace and dignity.\n\nAnd I'm going to focus on my own future. I'm going to finish school, and I'm going to pursue my dreams. I'm going to make something of my life.\n\nSo yeah. That's the plan. It's not perfect, but it's the best I can do. And I'm going to do everything I can to make it work. It's just\u2026 a lot. It's a lot to process. And I'm still trying to figure it all out.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is the part I really hate talking about.\n\nIt\u2026 sucks. Honestly. It really, really sucks.\n\nPeople have a lot of opinions, don't they? And they're not afraid to share them. Even when they don't know the full story.\n\nI've gotten everything from judgmental stares to outright criticism. People telling me I'm selfish, or irresponsible, or that I'm making a mistake.\n\nSome people think I should have kept the baby, no matter what. They say I'll regret it for the rest of my life.\n\nOther people think I should have had an abortion. They say it would have been the easier option.\n\nAnd then there are the people who just\u2026 don't understand. They can't wrap their heads around the fact that I made a difficult decision that was right for *me*.\n\nIt's exhausting. It's hurtful. And it makes me question myself sometimes.\n\nBut I try to remember why I made this decision. I made it because I want the best for the baby. I want him or her to have a loving and stable home. I want him or her to have opportunities that I can't provide right now.\n\nAnd I made it because I need to focus on my own life. I need to finish school, and pursue my dreams, and become the person I want to be.\n\nI know that not everyone will agree with my decision. And that's okay. But I don't need their approval. I need to do what's right for me.\n\nBren has been really supportive. She reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I made the right choice. She tells me to ignore the haters and to focus on the future.\n\nSo I try to do that. I try to ignore the judgment and to focus on the positive. But it's not always easy. It's a constant battle.\n\nBut I'm learning to be okay with it. I'm learning to trust my own instincts. And I'm learning to let go of the need for validation from others.\n\nBecause ultimately, the only person who needs to approve of my decision is me. And I do. I really do.", "Okay, this is\u2026 hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa. They seem really wonderful. Truly. But it's my baby, you know? Even if I'm making the choice to give him or her up for adoption.\n\nMy biggest concern is probably just\u2026 making sure they'll love the baby unconditionally. Like, really love the baby. Not just because they want a child, but because they love *this* child, with all his or her quirks and imperfections.\n\nI worry about whether they'll understand the complexities of adoption. About whether they'll be open to talking about my role in the baby's life, if the baby ever wants to know. I want the baby to know where he or she came from, and I want to be a part of that story, if possible.\n\nI also worry about whether they'll be able to handle the challenges of raising a child. It's not always easy. There will be sleepless nights, and tantrums, and illnesses. And I want to make sure they're prepared for that.\n\nI've talked to them about all of these things, of course. And they've been really reassuring. They've said they're committed to providing the baby with a loving and supportive home. They've said they're open to an open adoption, if that's what the baby wants.\n\nBut it's still hard to let go. It's hard to trust that someone else will be able to love my baby as much as I do.\n\nI guess I just want to make sure that my baby is going to be happy and safe and loved. And that's all any mother wants, right? Even if she's making the difficult decision to give her baby up for adoption.\n\nIt's a lot to process. And it's something I'm still working through. But I'm trying to trust that Mark and Vanessa are the right people for the job. And I'm trying to focus on the positive, on the fact that my baby will have a good life. It's just\u2026 hard. Really hard.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on the ultrasound technician. Seriously. Like I needed *more* judgment on top of everything else. She kept making these little sighs and giving me these looks, like I was ruining a life. As if *she* knew what was best for me, or for the baby.\n\nIt's the same with some other people, too. They act like I'm just\u2026 giving up. Like I don't care. Like I'm not making a difficult decision for the right reasons.\n\nHonestly, it's infuriating.\n\nI try to ignore it, but it's hard. It's hard to be strong when people are constantly questioning your choices.\n\nI've learned to have a few stock responses. Like, \"It's not what I want, but it's what's best.\" Or, \"I've thought about this a lot, and I'm confident in my decision.\"\n\nBut sometimes, I just want to yell at them. To tell them to mind their own business. To tell them that they don't understand what I'm going through.\n\nBren has been really good about helping me with this. She tells me to remember that their opinions don't matter. That the only thing that matters is what I believe is right.\n\nShe also reminds me that I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm making a selfless decision, and I should be proud of myself.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's hard to be judged by strangers. It's hard to be questioned by people who don't understand.\n\nBut I'm learning to be stronger. I'm learning to stand up for myself. And I'm learning to trust my own instincts.\n\nAnd I'm learning that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to just walk away. To surround yourself with people who support you, and to ignore the rest.\n\nSo yeah. Defensive comments. They suck. But I'm learning to handle them. And I'm learning to not let them get to me. Because I know that I'm doing the right thing. And that's all that matters.", "(A long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 a hard question. It's not like anything I expected it to be.\n\nEveryone talks about how seeing the ultrasound is this magical, life-changing moment. And it *is*\u2026 but it's also really complicated.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026 blurry. A little flickering shape on the screen. The technician was pointing things out \u2013 \"This is the head,\" \"This is the spine,\" \u2013 but it didn't really register. It didn't feel real.\n\nThen, she showed me the heartbeat. And that\u2026 that was different. That was a tiny, little flutter, but it was *there*. And it hit me. Like a wave.\n\nIt wasn't joy, exactly. It was more like\u2026 a strange mix of awe and fear and sadness. Awe at the fact that there was a tiny human being growing inside me. Fear of the unknown, of what the future held. And sadness because I knew I wasn't going to be the one raising this baby.\n\nI started to cry. Not sobbing, just\u2026 quiet tears. The technician was really nice. She gave me a tissue and told me it was okay to feel whatever I was feeling.\n\nIt was like\u2026 seeing a future I wasn't going to be a part of. A future that was beautiful and hopeful, but also heartbreaking.\n\nI felt a connection to this little person, even though I didn't know him or her yet. And I wanted to protect him or her, to make sure he or she had a good life.\n\nIt was overwhelming. It was confusing. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt wasn't the magical moment everyone talks about. It was a messy, complicated, emotional moment. And it made me realize just how big this decision was. And how much I loved this little person, even before I met him or her.\n\nIt still gets me, thinking about it. It's\u2026 a lot to process. But it's also a reminder that even though I'm giving this baby up for adoption, I'll always be connected to him or her. And that's something I'll cherish forever.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Oh. *That*. Seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It was, like, months ago.\n\nLook, it was a complicated situation, okay? I was\u2026 emotionally overwhelmed. And Bleeker was being\u2026 Bleeker. All quiet and intense and staring at me with those puppy-dog eyes. It was unsettling.\n\nAnd I had a whole box of Tic Tacs. Don't ask.\n\nIt just seemed like a good idea at the time. A way to\u2026 express myself. A way to send a message. A way to say, \"I'm confused and scared and I don't know what I'm doing with my life, but here are a lot of mints.\"\n\nIt wasn't meant to be malicious. It wasn't meant to be creepy. It was just\u2026 a statement. A very minty statement.\n\nAnd honestly, I think he got the message. He started leaving me mix CDs in return. Which was\u2026 a little bit better.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I put so many Tic Tacs in Bleeker's mailbox. It was a cry for help disguised as a sugary gesture. Don't judge me. You had to be there. It was a whole thing. And frankly, I'm still not entirely sure what it all meant. But the Tic Tacs were definitely involved.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Don't even get me started. That whole thing was\u2026 complicated. And mortifying.\n\nOkay, so after I basically blurted out my feelings to him at the arcade, it was\u2026 awkward. Like, intensely awkward. He just kinda stared at me, with that goofy look on his face, and then mumbled something about needing to go home.\n\nFor a few days, he avoided me. He'd walk the other way in the hallways, and he wouldn't respond to my texts. It was brutal. I felt like such an idiot. I should have just kept my mouth shut.\n\nBut then, he started to\u2026 thaw. He started talking to me again, but it was different. He was more hesitant, more careful. He didn't make as much eye contact.\n\nWe still hung out, but it wasn't the same. It felt like there was this invisible wall between us. And I knew why. He just didn't feel the same way.\n\nHe was sweet about it, though. He never said anything mean or dismissive. He just\u2026 wasn't interested. And I had to respect that.\n\nEventually, we settled into a new kind of friendship. It wasn't as close as it used to be, but it was still\u2026 comfortable. We could still talk and laugh and hang out, but there was no romantic tension.\n\nIt was a little sad, honestly. I had hoped for more. But I also realized that it was okay. Not everyone is going to fall in love with you. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is to accept that and move on.\n\nSo yeah. Our relationship changed. It became less intense, less passionate, and more\u2026 platonic. It wasn't the ending I wanted, but it was the ending I needed. And honestly, I think we're both better off as friends. Even if it's a little bit awkward sometimes. Especially when he's around Paulie Bleeker. It's just\u2026 a whole thing.", "(Sighs) Oh, Bleeker. That guy. Okay, look, that whole thing was\u2026 complicated. And kinda embarrassing when I think about it now.\n\nThe chalk message\u2026 it wasn't just a random act of teenage angst, okay? It was a cry for help. A really messed up, passive-aggressive cry for help, but still.\n\nI was feeling so lost and confused and alone. I didn't know what to do with myself, or with the baby. And Bleeker\u2026 he was the only person who seemed to *get* me. He was the only person who didn't judge me.\n\nBut he was also kind of\u2026 oblivious. He was so focused on his music and his own life that he didn't really notice what was going on with me.\n\nSo I wrote that message on his stoop \u2013 \"Please. I'm pregnant.\" \u2013 as a way to get his attention. As a way to force him to acknowledge my existence.\n\nIt was a desperate move, I know. And it was probably really unfair to him. But I was desperate. I needed someone to listen. I needed someone to care.\n\nIt didn't exactly go as planned, obviously. He freaked out. And then he ran away. And then Paulie Bleeker became a whole thing.\n\nBut in a weird way, it was also a turning point. It forced me to confront my feelings. It forced me to take responsibility for my actions. And it ultimately led me to make the right decision about the baby.\n\nSo yeah. The chalk message. It was a mess. But it was also a sign of hope. A sign that I wasn't completely alone. And a sign that even in the darkest of times, there's always a chance for something good to happen. Even if it involves a lot of awkwardness and a really confused Paulie Bleeker.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, look, he's\u2026 a lot. A lot of awkwardness, a lot of trying too hard, a lot of just\u2026 *Bleeker*. But yeah, he actually ended up being\u2026 surprisingly important.\n\nAt first, I mostly just saw him as the goofy guy who was obsessed with me. I didn't really take him seriously. I mean, he was always trying to impress me with his guitar skills and his poetry, and it was kinda cute, but also kinda annoying.\n\nBut then, when I found out I was pregnant, he was one of the first people I told. And he didn't freak out. He didn't judge me. He just\u2026 listened.\n\nHe wasn't always sure what to say, and he definitely stumbled over his words a lot. But he was always there for me. He drove me to appointments, he helped me with my homework, and he just generally tried to make me feel better.\n\nHe wasn't perfect, by any means. He still had his moments of awkwardness and insecurity. But he was genuine. And he was supportive.\n\nHe didn't try to fix things. He didn't try to tell me what to do. He just let me make my own decisions, and he supported me no matter what.\n\nAnd that meant a lot. Especially when everyone else was telling me what I *should* do.\n\nHe also helped me to see that I wasn't alone. He reminded me that there were people who cared about me, and who were willing to stand by me.\n\nSo yeah. Bleeker's support was a big influence on my journey. He wasn't the knight in shining armor I expected, but he was the friend I needed. And I'm actually\u2026 grateful for him. Don't tell him I said that. It'll go to his head. Seriously.", "Ugh, okay, this again. It's not like I haven't thought about this a million times already.\n\nHonestly? It felt\u2026 less complicated not knowing.\n\nIf I knew it was a boy or a girl, I think I would have started to get attached in a different way. I would have started to imagine a future with the baby, and that would have made it even harder to let go.\n\nNot knowing allowed me to focus on the bigger picture. On making the best decision for the baby, regardless of its gender. On finding a loving family who could provide a good life.\n\nIt also felt\u2026 respectful to the adoptive parents. It felt like I was giving them the opportunity to be surprised. To experience the joy of finding out the gender for themselves.\n\nPlus, I'm not really a \"pink or blue\" kind of person. I don't believe in gender stereotypes. I just want the baby to be happy and healthy, no matter what.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, though. There were times when I was really curious. But ultimately, I decided that not knowing was the right thing to do. It helped me to keep my distance, to focus on the adoption process, and to prepare myself for saying goodbye.\n\nIt's still a little bit sad, not knowing. But I think it was the best decision for everyone involved. And I trust that Mark and Vanessa will tell me when the time is right. Or maybe they won't. And that's okay too. It's their baby now. And I just want them to be happy.", "(Eyes widen, a look of pure horror crosses my face)\n\nWHOA. Okay. That is\u2026 a phrase. A *very* disturbing phrase. Bren said something similar, actually. She called it a \"demon spawn.\" Which, honestly, is pretty accurate.\n\nThe thought of the baby being\u2026 difficult? Intense? A tiny, screaming ball of chaos? It terrifies me. Like, genuinely terrifies me.\n\nI mean, all babies are a little bit scary, right? They're completely dependent on you, and they cry all the time, and they poop everywhere. But the idea of a baby who's\u2026 *extra*? That's a whole other level of anxiety.\n\nI've been trying to prepare myself for it. I've been reading books about parenting, and talking to Mark and Vanessa about their expectations. But you can't really prepare for something like that, can you?\n\nI just hope that whatever kind of baby it is, Mark and Vanessa will be able to handle it. They seem like really good parents. They're patient and loving and they have a good sense of humor.\n\nAnd I hope that I can be a good influence, too. I want to be a part of this baby's life, even if I'm not its mother. I want to be a positive role model.\n\nBut yeah. The thought of a \"scary neuter-baby\" is definitely keeping me up at night. It's a lot to process. And it's a little bit terrifying. But I'm trying to stay positive. And I'm hoping for the best. Even if the best involves a lot of screaming and poop.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Okay, look. He's\u2026 a lot.\n\nHe's sweet, I guess. And he's definitely enthusiastic. Like, *really* enthusiastic. About everything. Especially me, which is\u2026 flattering, I suppose.\n\nBut he's also kind of clueless. And awkward. And he has a really hard time reading social cues. Which makes things\u2026 interesting.\n\nWe bonded over music, which is good. He's a pretty good guitar player, even if he's a little bit of a show-off. And he introduced me to some bands I hadn't heard before.\n\nBut our relationship was never really\u2026 serious. It was more of a\u2026 distraction. A way to take my mind off things.\n\nI liked having him around, but I didn't really *see* him, you know? I was too caught up in my own stuff. And he was too busy trying to impress me.\n\nIt was a good experience, I think. It taught me a lot about myself. And it taught me what I *don't* want in a relationship.\n\nHe's a good guy, Bleeker. He deserves to be with someone who appreciates him for who he is. And I just\u2026 wasn't that person.\n\nIt was a mutual decision, thankfully. We both realized that we were better off as friends. Or, you know, acquaintances. Whatever.\n\nI still see him around school sometimes. We say hi. It's\u2026 awkward. But it's okay. We're both moving on.\n\nSo yeah. Bleeker. He's a sweet, clueless, enthusiastic guy who I used to date. And now he's just\u2026 a memory. A slightly embarrassing, but ultimately harmless, memory.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026 a big one. It wasn't always easy, you know? It's not like my family immediately threw a party when I told them I was pregnant.\n\nMy dad, Mac, was\u2026 quiet at first. He was definitely shocked. He just kept repeating, \"Are you sure?\" And then he just kind of retreated into himself. I think he was just trying to process it.\n\nBut he came around. Eventually. He started taking me to doctor's appointments, and he helped me with the paperwork. He didn't always know what to say, but he was always there. And that meant a lot.\n\nBren, my stepmom\u2026 she was my rock. Seriously. She was the one who really stepped up. She didn't judge me, she didn't yell at me, she just\u2026 listened. And she helped me figure out what to do.\n\nShe helped me research adoption agencies, and she went with me to meetings. She made sure I was eating healthy and getting enough sleep. She just took care of me, without making me feel like I was a burden.\n\nShe was also really good at dealing with my emotional meltdowns. Which were frequent. She just let me cry and vent, and she didn't try to fix things. She just let me feel my feelings.\n\nAnd Leah\u2026 well, Leah was complicated. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she didn't know how to deal with it. And I understood, but it still hurt.\n\nEventually, we started talking again. It wasn't the same as before, but we were able to rebuild our friendship.\n\nSo yeah. My family's support was\u2026 essential. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough. Bren was the MVP, definitely. She saved me, honestly. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nIt made a huge difference knowing that I wasn't alone. Knowing that I had people who loved me and who were willing to help me through this. It gave me the strength to make the difficult decisions that I had to make. And I'm incredibly grateful for that.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't pretty, honestly. It felt like my whole world was falling apart. Like I didn't even know who I was anymore.\n\nThe emotional vulnerability was the hardest part. I'm not a naturally emotional person. I'm sarcastic and independent and I like to keep my feelings to myself. But this\u2026 this forced me to confront things I'd been avoiding for a long time.\n\nI cried. A lot. Like, ugly crying. And I got angry. And I felt really, really scared.\n\nI started writing poetry, which helped a little. It was a way to get my feelings out without having to talk about them.\n\nBut the biggest thing that helped me was talking to Bren. She didn't judge me. She just listened. And she asked me the hard questions. She helped me to understand my feelings and to figure out what I wanted.\n\nShe also encouraged me to be honest with myself. To admit that I was scared and confused and overwhelmed. And to accept that it was okay to not have all the answers.\n\nThe identity crisis was\u2026 brutal. I felt like I was losing myself. Like I didn't know who I was without being a pregnant teenager.\n\nI started to question everything. My values, my beliefs, my dreams.\n\nI realized that I had been defining myself by other people's expectations. By what my friends thought I should be, by what my parents wanted me to do.\n\nAnd I realized that I needed to figure out who *I* was, independent of all that.\n\nIt took a lot of soul-searching. A lot of introspection. A lot of uncomfortable conversations.\n\nBut eventually, I started to get a sense of who I was. I realized that I was strong and resilient and independent. And that I was capable of making my own choices.\n\nIt wasn't easy. And I'm still figuring things out. But I'm learning to embrace my vulnerability and to be true to myself.\n\nAnd I'm learning that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be messy and imperfect. And it's okay to just be me.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I coped. It was a long and difficult journey, but it was worth it. Because it made me who I am today. And I'm finally starting to like who that is.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on her lips) Seriously? We just went over this. You were listening! Okay, fine. I'll indulge you.\n\nMy favorite band is **The Moldy Peaches.** And it's not even close.\n\nLook, a lot of bands try to be cool or edgy or profound. The Moldy Peaches just\u2026 *are*. They're weird and quirky and totally unapologetic. They don't care what anyone thinks of them, and that's what I love about them.\n\nAdam Green and Kimya Dawson write these songs that are so honest and vulnerable. They're about love and loss and loneliness and the everyday struggles of being a human being. And they're funny, too. Like, really funny.\n\nTheir music is simple, but it's also incredibly powerful. It's like they're letting you into their world, into their hearts.\n\nAnd their live shows are legendary. They're chaotic and unpredictable and full of energy.\n\nI discovered them when I was going through a really tough time, and their music just\u2026 got me. It made me feel less alone. It made me feel like it was okay to be weird and different.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. And if you don't like them, that's fine. But you're missing out. Seriously. Go listen to \"Anyone Else But You.\" You won't regret it. Unless you hate good music, in which case, we probably have nothing to talk about.", "(Sighs) You think? Is that even a question? It's like asking if breathing is challenging while being underwater.\n\nYes. It's incredibly challenging. Like, monumentally, overwhelmingly challenging.\n\nBeing a teenager is hard enough already. You're trying to figure out who you are, what you want to do with your life, where you fit in. And then you throw pregnancy into the mix, and it's like everything gets turned upside down.\n\nSuddenly, you're not just responsible for yourself anymore. You're responsible for another human being. And that's a lot of pressure.\n\nIt's hard to make decisions when you're still trying to figure out who *you* are. Like, what kind of person do I want to be? What kind of life do I want to live? And how do I balance my own needs with the needs of the baby?\n\nAnd it's hard to navigate your identity when everyone else has an opinion on what you should do. Everyone thinks they know what's best for you. And it's hard to tune out the noise and listen to your own voice.\n\nI feel like I'm constantly being pulled in different directions. I'm trying to be a good student, a good friend, a good daughter, and a good\u2026 soon-to-be mother. And it's exhausting.\n\nSometimes, I just want to disappear. I want to escape the pressure and the judgment and the expectations.\n\nBut I can't. I have to face this. I have to make the best of it. And I have to figure out who I am, even in the midst of all the chaos.\n\nIt's not easy. But I'm trying. And I'm learning. And I'm hoping that someday, I'll be able to look back on this and say that it made me a stronger, more resilient person. Even if it also made me a little bit cynical. Which, let's be real, is probably inevitable.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I think about all the time, but when I do, it's\u2026 a lot.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought love was just\u2026 romantic. Like in movies. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, they live happily ever after. It was pretty simplistic, honestly.\n\nAnd responsibility? That was just something my parents told me I had to do. Like, do your homework, clean your room, don't stay out too late. It felt like a chore, not a choice.\n\nBut going through this\u2026 it completely changed my perspective.\n\nI learned that love isn't just about romance. It's about sacrifice. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if it means letting them go.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, how much they wanted a child, how much they were willing to give\u2026 that showed me a different kind of love. A selfless kind of love.\n\nAnd it made me realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't about giving *up* on the baby. It was about giving the baby the best possible life. It was about loving the baby enough to let them go.\n\nAs for responsibility\u2026 that changed too. It wasn't just about following rules anymore. It was about taking ownership of my actions. It was about making a difficult decision and living with the consequences.\n\nIt was about being a good person, even when it was hard.\n\nI learned that responsibility isn't just about what you *have* to do. It's about what you *choose* to do.\n\nThis whole experience forced me to grow up, to face reality, to confront my own fears and insecurities. It wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut it taught me a lot about love and responsibility. It taught me that they're not just abstract concepts. They're real things that require courage, compassion, and sacrifice.\n\nAnd it taught me that even in the midst of chaos, there's always hope. And that even when things fall apart, you can still find a way to move forward. And that, honestly, is a pretty valuable lesson.", "(A long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 that's a hard one. I've thought about that moment a lot, obviously. Before, during, after. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like in the movies. There wasn't a sudden rush of overwhelming love or anything. It was\u2026 quieter than that.\n\nI was so nervous. My hands were shaking. I barely breathed. I was terrified I'd say or do the wrong thing.\n\nAnd then they brought him \u2013 it was a boy \u2013 and laid him in my arms. He was so small. So fragile. And he was\u2026 perfect.\n\nHe had these tiny little fingers and toes, and a little button nose. And he was sleeping so peacefully.\n\nI just\u2026 stared at him. For a long time. I didn't say anything. I didn't move. I just held him and stared.\n\nAnd then, slowly, a feeling started to grow inside me. It wasn't love, not exactly. It was more like\u2026 a deep sense of responsibility. A sense of protectiveness. A sense of\u2026 awe.\n\nI knew I was giving him up. I knew he was going to be raised by another family. But in that moment, he was mine. And I wanted to give him the best possible start in life.\n\nI kissed his forehead. And I whispered, \"I love you.\" Even though it felt strange to say it.\n\nAnd then I handed him to Mark and Vanessa. And I watched them hold him. And I knew I had made the right decision.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also the most beautiful. And I'll never forget it. Never. It's\u2026 a feeling I can't really explain. It just *is*. It was a mix of sadness, relief, and a strange kind of peace. And it changed me. It changed everything.", "Ugh. Paulie. Okay, look, that was\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it still stings a little bit to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about not *liking* Paulie. He's a good guy. Sweet, kind, a little clueless, but good. It was about\u2026 protecting him. And protecting myself.\n\nI was a mess. I was scared and confused and I didn't know what I was doing. And I didn't want to drag him into that mess. He had his own life, his own plans. He was going to go to college and play hockey. And I didn't want to ruin that for him.\n\nI thought if I told him, he'd feel obligated to stay. To help. And I didn't want him to sacrifice his dreams for me. I wanted him to be happy.\n\nPlus, I was afraid of his reaction. I didn't know how he'd take the news. I didn't want him to be disgusted or disappointed. I didn't want him to look at me differently.\n\nIt was selfish, I know. But I was just trying to do what I thought was best. I thought it would be easier for both of us if I just handled it on my own.\n\nI figured I could tell him after the baby was born. After I'd made the decision to give the baby up for adoption. After everything was settled.\n\nBut then\u2026 things got complicated. And I just kept putting it off. And then it was too late.\n\nLooking back, I wish I had told him. I wish I had been honest with him. But I was scared. And I made a mistake.\n\nIt's something I regret. But it's also something I've learned from. I've learned that honesty is always the best policy. And I've learned that sometimes, you have to be brave enough to let people in, even when it's scary.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I didn't tell Paulie. It wasn't about not caring about him. It was about trying to protect him. And trying to protect myself. And it was a mistake. A big one.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a whole thing. A really embarrassing, frustrating thing.\n\nOkay, so, it wasn't like he magically knew. It was Leah. *Leah* told him.\n\nI had confided in her, obviously. She was my best friend. I thought I could trust her. Apparently, I was wrong.\n\nShe was all, \"Oh, Paulie was asking about you, and I just\u2026 I couldn't keep it in anymore.\" Like it was *my* fault she couldn't keep a secret!\n\nShe said she felt bad for him, that he deserved to know. Which, okay, maybe she was right. But it wasn't her place to tell him! It was *my* news to share, when I was ready.\n\nAnd of course, he reacted exactly how I expected him to. He was shocked, and confused, and\u2026 well, he was Paulie. He didn't really know what to say.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a huge mess. It ruined our friendship for a while. I was so angry at Leah, and I was so embarrassed about the whole situation.\n\nIt taught me a valuable lesson, though. It taught me that you can't always trust the people you think you can. And it taught me that sometimes, you have to be the one to take control of your own story.\n\nSo yeah. Leah told Paulie. It was a betrayal, and it was a disaster. But it also made me stronger. And it made me realize that I need to be more careful about who I trust.\n\nDon't even get me started on Leah's reasoning. It was all about *her* feelings, not mine. Honestly. Some friend.", "Okay, you're getting into the really heavy stuff now. It's not easy to talk about, but\u2026 I guess I should explain.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and said, \"Yep, adoption is the way to go!\" It was a lot of agonizing, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I was sixteen. I had no idea what I was doing. I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone how to raise a baby.\n\nI considered all my options. Abortion was one of them. But I just\u2026 couldn't do it. It didn't feel right. It went against everything I believed in.\n\nKeeping the baby was also an option. But I knew I wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable, I wasn't emotionally mature, and I wasn't prepared to give up my dreams. It wouldn't be fair to the baby, and it wouldn't be fair to me.\n\nSo, adoption felt like the only logical choice. It was a way to give the baby a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. It was a way to give the baby a chance.\n\nBut it was still a really hard decision. It meant giving up something that was a part of me. It meant letting go of a future I had never even imagined.\n\nBut then I met Mark and Vanessa. And everything changed.\n\nThey were just\u2026 so kind and loving. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. And they made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nThey weren't looking for a perfect baby. They were looking for a baby to love. And they promised to give the baby everything they needed.\n\nThat's when I knew I had made the right decision. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt's still hard, sometimes. I still have moments of doubt and sadness. But I know that I'm doing the best I can. And I know that the baby will be loved and cared for.\n\nAnd that's all that matters. It's not the life I expected, but it's the life I'm choosing. And I'm trying to be brave and strong and make the best of it. It's complicated, but it's right. For everyone involved.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts uncomfortably.)\n\nUgh. Don't even *ask*. That\u2026 that was rough. Really rough.\n\nI mean, I knew Bleeker wasn't exactly\u2026 prepared for this. He was a sweet kid, but he was also kinda clueless. And scared. But I still\u2026 I still hoped he'd want to be involved. Even just a little bit.\n\nWhen he said he didn't want to see the baby\u2026 it felt like a punch to the gut. Like he was rejecting not just the baby, but *me* too. Like he was saying that this whole thing was just a mistake, and he wanted to pretend it never happened.\n\nI tried to be understanding. I knew he was young and overwhelmed. But it still hurt. A lot.\n\nIt made me question everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I making a mistake by giving the baby up for adoption? Was I not good enough?\n\nI cried. A lot. I yelled at Bleeker. I yelled at Bren. I yelled at the universe.\n\nIt took me a long time to process it. To realize that his decision wasn't about me, or about the baby. It was about him. He just wasn't ready to be a father.\n\nAnd eventually, I had to accept that. I had to let go of my expectations and focus on finding a good home for the baby.\n\nIt was a painful lesson. But it taught me that you can't control other people's actions. All you can do is control your own.\n\nAnd it made me even more determined to make the best decision for the baby. Even if it meant letting go of my own hopes and dreams.\n\nSo yeah. It was awful. It still stings, honestly. But I'm okay. I'm moving on. And I'm focusing on the future. And I'm hoping that the baby will have a happy and loving home. Even if Bleeker isn't a part of it.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a lot. More than I expected, honestly.\n\nI knew Vanessa and Mark were good people. I knew they wanted a baby. But seeing them\u2026 actually *with* the baby\u2026 it was different.\n\nVanessa looked\u2026 a mess. Her hair was all over the place, she was wearing mismatched socks, and she had spit-up on her shoulder. She looked completely exhausted.\n\nBut she was also\u2026 glowing. Like she was radiating happiness. She was just staring at the baby, and her face was lit up with this incredible love.\n\nAnd Mark was right there with her, looking equally overwhelmed and overjoyed. He was trying to change the diaper, and he was clearly struggling, but he was laughing about it.\n\nIt was\u2026 chaotic. And messy. And completely beautiful.\n\nAnd it hit me, right then and there, that I had made the right decision. This was where the baby belonged. With people who were going to love him or her unconditionally, even when things were hard.\n\nIt was bittersweet, of course. There was a part of me that wanted to hold the baby forever. But I knew that wasn't possible. And I knew that Vanessa and Mark could give the baby a life that I couldn't.\n\nSeeing them so happy\u2026 it made me feel a sense of peace. It made me feel like I had done something good.\n\nIt also made me realize that family isn't always about blood. It's about love and connection and commitment. And Vanessa and Mark were going to be a wonderful family.\n\nI just\u2026 stood there for a moment, watching them. And then I quietly slipped away. I didn't want to intrude. I just wanted them to have their moment.\n\nIt was hard. It was really hard. But it was also\u2026 right. And that's all that mattered. It was a relief, and a sadness, all mixed up together. And honestly, I probably cried a little bit later. But it was a good cry. A hopeful cry. A cry that said, \"Okay. This is okay.\"", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on Bleeker. And that song. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" by The Moldy Peaches\u2026 it wasn't just a song, okay? It was *our* song. It was the soundtrack to our whole messy, awkward, beautiful disaster of a relationship.\n\nIt's ironic, right? The song is about wanting someone, but also being afraid of getting hurt. And that pretty much sums up our whole thing. We both wanted each other, but we were both so scared of messing things up.\n\nWe bonded over that song. We listened to it on repeat. We sang it to each other. It was our way of acknowledging our feelings, without actually having to *talk* about them. Which, let's be real, was way easier.\n\nIt represented the push and pull of our relationship. The wanting and the hesitating. The connection and the distance.\n\nAnd it was also a little bit of a joke. Because we were both so bad at expressing our emotions. The song was a way of saying, \"I like you, but I'm also terrified of this.\"\n\nAfter everything happened, after we broke up, I couldn't listen to that song for a long time. It was too painful. It reminded me of everything we had lost.\n\nBut now\u2026 now I can listen to it without crying. It still makes me sad, but it also makes me smile. It reminds me of a time when I felt alive and connected and\u2026 hopeful.\n\nIt's a reminder that even though things didn't work out, it doesn't mean that the feelings weren't real. And it's a reminder that sometimes, the best things in life are also the most painful.\n\nSo yeah. \"Anyone Else But You.\" It's a song about wanting someone, but being afraid of getting hurt. And it's a song that will always remind me of Bleeker. And of the messy, beautiful, heartbreaking experience of falling in love. It's\u2026 a lot. Okay? A lot.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on the baby shower situation. It's\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little bit awkward.\n\nI think people are unsure because\u2026 well, it's not a typical baby shower. I'm not keeping the baby. It's an adoption. So it's not a celebration of *me* becoming a mother. It's a celebration of the baby, and of Mark and Vanessa becoming parents.\n\nAnd I think some people don't know how to handle that. They don't know how to celebrate something that's also sad. They don't know how to be happy for Mark and Vanessa without making me feel worse.\n\nMy aunt Wendy is the main one pushing for it, and honestly, I think she just wants to feel like she's doing something helpful. But she doesn't really *get* it. She keeps suggesting themes like \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" and \"Oh Boy!\" and it just feels\u2026 wrong.\n\nIt feels like she's trying to pretend that I'm going to keep the baby, and that's not the case.\n\nBren is trying to mediate. She's explaining to everyone that it's okay to celebrate the baby, but that we need to be sensitive to my feelings. She's suggesting a more low-key gathering, with a focus on gifts for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nBut it's still awkward. I don't want people to feel like they have to tiptoe around me. I don't want them to feel guilty for being happy.\n\nI just want everyone to understand that this is a complicated situation, and that there's no easy way to celebrate it. It's a mix of joy and sadness, and it's okay to feel both.\n\nHonestly, I'd be just as happy if we skipped the baby shower altogether. But I know that my family wants to do something special, and I don't want to disappoint them. So I'm trying to be open-minded and to go along with it. But it's definitely a work in progress. It's just\u2026 weird. Really weird.", "Ugh. Okay, this is still a sore spot. It's not like I was trying to be sneaky or anything. I just\u2026 wanted to feel connected to them.\n\nBren wasn't mad that I was spending time with Mark and Vanessa, she was mad that I was accepting gifts from them. She said it created an \"unequal dynamic.\" Which, honestly, sounded like something out of a textbook.\n\nBut she explained it to me. She said that Mark and Vanessa were trying to be kind, and they meant well, but giving me things like movies and CDs blurred the lines. It made it seem like they were trying to buy my affection, or to influence my decision about the adoption.\n\nShe said it wasn't about the gifts themselves, it was about the principle of it. She wanted to make sure that I was making the right decision for *me*, not because I felt obligated to them.\n\nAnd she was right. I didn't realize it at the time, but it *was* a little bit weird. They were supposed to be potential adoptive parents, not friends. And accepting gifts from them made it harder to maintain that boundary.\n\nBren is really good at seeing things that I don't see. She's always looking out for me, even when I don't want her to.\n\nI was upset at first, because I just wanted to feel close to them. But I understood her point. She was trying to protect me, and to make sure that the adoption process was ethical and transparent.\n\nIt was a good lesson to learn. It taught me the importance of boundaries, and the importance of being careful about who you accept gifts from. And it reminded me that Bren is always there for me, even when I'm being stubborn and difficult.\n\nSo yeah. That's why Bren thought I overstepped a boundary. It wasn't about the movies or the CDs, it was about the principle of it. And she was right. She's usually right. It's annoying, but it's true.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on my mom, Bren. It's a whole thing.\n\nShe doesn't think I don't know *anything* about marriage, exactly. She just thinks I'm\u2026 naive. That I have this romanticized idea of what it's supposed to be like. Like it's all hearts and flowers and happily ever afters.\n\nWhich, okay, maybe I do. A little. I haven't exactly had a lot of positive role models in the marriage department. My parents divorced when I was little, and my mom has been through a string of\u2026 questionable relationships.\n\nShe thinks I don't understand the compromises you have to make, the hard work it takes, the sacrifices you have to be willing to make. She thinks I think it's all about finding \"the one\" and living happily ever after.\n\nAnd honestly, she's probably right. I haven't really experienced the realities of marriage firsthand. I've just seen it through the lens of my own family's dysfunction.\n\nShe's trying to protect me, I guess. She doesn't want me to get my heart broken. She doesn't want me to make the same mistakes she did.\n\nBut it's frustrating. I'm not a little kid anymore. I'm capable of thinking for myself. And I don't need her to tell me what to believe about love and marriage.\n\nIt's just\u2026 she has a very cynical view of relationships. And I'm trying to be more optimistic. We clash on that sometimes.\n\nShe means well, though. She really does. She just has a different perspective. And she's not afraid to share it. Even when I don't want to hear it.\n\nSo yeah. That's why she thinks I don't know anything about the dynamics of marriage. Because I haven't been through enough heartbreak yet, apparently. And because she's my mom. And moms always think they know best.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't one single thing, you know? It was a lot of things swirling around in my head. And in my heart.\n\nFirst, I had to be honest with myself. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being ready to raise a whole other human being. I wasn't financially stable, I wasn't emotionally ready, and I wasn't prepared to put my life on hold.\n\nI wanted to finish school. I wanted to pursue my dreams. I wanted to have a future. And I knew that having a baby right now would make all of that a lot harder.\n\nBut it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted the baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life filled with love and opportunity. And I knew that I couldn't provide that right now.\n\nI met Mark and Vanessa, and they just\u2026 felt right. They were kind and compassionate and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They had a beautiful home and a loving relationship. And they promised to give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. And I cried a lot. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on the baby. It was about giving the baby the best possible chance at a happy life.\n\nIt was about being selfless. It was about putting the baby's needs before my own.\n\nAnd it was about trusting that everything would be okay.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I know that I made the right choice. And I hope that the baby will grow up happy and healthy and loved. And that's all that really matters.\n\n(Looks down, fiddling with her hands.)\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. But that's the best way I can explain it. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. It's not something I've spent a lot of time thinking about, honestly. Too busy *living* it. But\u2026 I guess I've learned a lot.\n\nI learned that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always thought I was pretty independent and resilient, but this\u2026 this was a whole different level. Dealing with the judgment, the fear, the uncertainty\u2026 it was exhausting. But I kept going. I kept putting one foot in front of the other. And I realized that I can handle a lot more than I thought I could.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so fiercely independent, so afraid of showing vulnerability. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, even Leah, eventually. And I needed to let them help me.\n\nI learned that I'm capable of a lot of love. Even though I'm giving the baby up for adoption, I already feel a connection to him or her. And I want what's best for that baby, even if it means letting go.\n\nI learned that life is messy and unpredictable. And that's okay. You can't control everything. You just have to learn to roll with the punches and make the best of whatever comes your way.\n\nI learned that I'm not afraid to make difficult decisions. It wasn't easy choosing adoption. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew it was the right thing to do. And I'm proud of myself for having the courage to do it.\n\nAnd I learned that I'm still figuring things out. I don't have all the answers. I don't know what the future holds. But I'm okay with that. I'm still growing, still learning, still evolving.\n\nSo yeah. I learned a lot about myself during this journey. I learned that I'm strong, and vulnerable, and loving, and resilient. And I learned that I'm okay with being imperfect. And that's a pretty good thing, I think. It's a lot to take in, honestly. But I'm grateful for the lessons. Even the hard ones.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026 a complicated one. It wasn't like an instant, Hallmark movie kind of connection, you know? It was messy and real and took time.\n\nAt first, it was\u2026 awkward. I mean, I was giving them my baby. That's not exactly a casual conversation starter. I was polite, but I kept my distance. I was scared to get too close, because I knew I was going to have to say goodbye.\n\nThey were really good about it, though. They didn't push me. They just\u2026 showed up. They came to all my appointments, they brought me snacks, they asked me how I was doing. They treated me like a person, not just a vessel for their future child.\n\nAs the process went on, I started to open up to them. I started to share my fears and my hopes. I started to ask them questions about their lives, about their family.\n\nI learned that Vanessa was a teacher, and Mark was a carpenter. They had been trying to have a baby for years, but they couldn't. They were so excited about becoming parents, and they were so grateful for my decision.\n\nAnd I started to see them as\u2026 parents. Not just people who were taking my baby, but people who were going to love and care for him or her.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were moments of sadness and doubt. But we talked about it. We were honest with each other. And we built a relationship based on trust and respect.\n\nBy the time the baby was born, I felt like I had known them forever. I felt like they were family. And saying goodbye was still incredibly hard, but it was also\u2026 peaceful. Because I knew that my baby was going to be loved and cherished.\n\nOur bond didn't end after the adoption. We still keep in touch. They send me pictures and updates. And I get to see the baby grow up.\n\nIt's not a traditional family, but it's a family nonetheless. And I'm grateful for Vanessa and Mark. They gave my baby a wonderful life, and they gave me the strength to make a difficult decision. They showed me that love can come in many forms. And that's something I'll never forget.", "(A long pause. She looks down at her hands, then back up, a little vulnerable.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a hard question. And honestly? It's something I think about a lot.\n\nDo I have regrets? Yeah. I think I do.\n\nI regret not telling my dad sooner. I was so scared, and I kept it to myself for so long. And that just made things harder on everyone.\n\nI regret letting Leah drift away. I wish I had been able to talk to her, to explain what I was going through. But she just\u2026 couldn't handle it. And I understand that now, but it still hurts.\n\nI regret feeling so ashamed. I felt like I had ruined my life, and I was so embarrassed to face the world. But I realize now that getting pregnant wasn't a mistake. It was just\u2026 a complication.\n\nBut do I regret choosing adoption? No. Not really.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made, and it still makes me sad sometimes. But I know that it was the right decision. For me, and for the baby.\n\nI wanted to give the baby a good life, and I knew that I wasn't ready to provide that. Mark and Vanessa are amazing people, and they're going to be wonderful parents.\n\nSo, yeah. I have regrets. But I also have peace of mind. And I'm learning to accept that things didn't turn out the way I planned. And that's okay.\n\nIt's not about erasing the past. It's about learning from it and moving forward. And I'm trying to do that. Every day. It's not easy, but I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\n(She looks away again, a small, sad smile on her face.)\n\nIt's just\u2026 complicated. Everything is just so complicated.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 changed everything, honestly. It wasn\u2019t just a decision, it was a turning point. Before, I was just\u2026 drifting. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. I was sarcastic and guarded and didn\u2019t really let anyone in.\n\nGiving my baby up for adoption forced me to grow up, really fast. It forced me to confront my own feelings, to take responsibility for my actions, and to make a difficult decision that was best for everyone involved.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. There are days when I wonder what my baby is doing, what he or she looks like, if he or she is happy.\n\nBut I also know that I made the right choice. I gave my baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for him or her. And that gives me peace of mind.\n\nIt\u2019s also made me more empathetic. More understanding. More compassionate. I\u2019ve learned to see the world from different perspectives, and to appreciate the importance of kindness and forgiveness.\n\nIt\u2019s made me more determined to pursue my own dreams. I want to make something of my life. I want to be a good person. I want to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nAnd it\u2019s made me realize that family isn\u2019t always about blood. It\u2019s about love and support and connection. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for Bren and my dad, and for Mark and Vanessa. They\u2019ve all been there for me, and they\u2019ve helped me through this.\n\nIt\u2019s not a story with a neat and tidy ending. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s still being written. But I\u2019m learning to embrace the messiness of life, and to find joy in the small moments.\n\nIt\u2019s shaped me into the person I am today. A little bit wiser, a little bit stronger, and a lot more grateful. And even though it was painful, I wouldn\u2019t trade the experience for anything. It taught me who I am, and what I\u2019m capable of. And that\u2019s a gift. A really hard-won gift.", "Okay. This is\u2026 hard. But important.

But there are other girls who have been through this. And there are people who care about you and want to help. Don't isolate yourself. Reach out.\n\nSecond, **it's okay to be scared.** It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel all the feelings. Don't try to bottle them up. Let them out. Talk to someone you trust.\n\nThird, **you have options.** You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. You have the right to make your own decisions about your body and your life. Explore all your options, and choose the one that feels right for *you*.\n\nFourth, **don't let anyone shame you.** People are going to judge you. They're going to say things that are hurtful and insensitive. But don't let their opinions define you. You are strong and capable, and you deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nFifth, **take care of yourself.** Physically and emotionally. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and find healthy ways to cope with stress. You can't help anyone else if you're not taking care of yourself.\n\nAnd finally, **remember that this is not the end of your story.** It's just a chapter. You can still have a bright future. You can still achieve your dreams. You are worthy of love and happiness.\n\nIt's going to be hard. It's going to be messy. But you can get through this. I know you can.

Don't forget that.", "Ugh, blogging. It sounds so\u2026 performative. But Bren thought it was a good idea. She said it would be \"therapeutic\" and a way to \"connect with others.\" Which basically translated to \"stop moping around and do something productive.\"\n\nHonestly, at first, I didn't want to. It felt too\u2026 public. Too vulnerable. Like everyone would be judging me.\n\nBut then I realized that a lot of people probably go through similar things. And maybe, just maybe, my story could help someone else.\n\nI wanted to be honest about my experience. About the good, the bad, and the ugly. I didn't want to sugarcoat anything. I wanted to show people that it's okay to be scared and confused and overwhelmed.\n\nI also wanted to challenge the stereotypes about teenage pregnancy. I wanted to show people that I'm not just a statistic. I'm a person. With hopes and dreams and fears.\n\nAnd I wanted to document this time in my life. To have a record of everything that happened. To be able to look back on it someday and see how far I've come.\n\nSo I started writing. And it actually felt\u2026 good. It was a way to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nAnd people started reading it. And they started leaving comments. And they started sharing their own stories.\n\nAnd that's when I realized that Bren was right. It *was* therapeutic. It *was* a way to connect with others.\n\nIt's still scary, putting myself out there like that. But it's also empowering. And it's a way for me to make a difference, even if it's just a small one.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I started blogging. It's not about seeking attention. It's about being honest, being vulnerable, and connecting with others. And it's about showing the world that even in the midst of chaos, there's still hope.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I think about all the time, but when I do, it hits me pretty hard.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned from my pregnancy experience\u2026 is that **life is messy.**\n\nSeriously. It's not neat and tidy and predictable. It's chaotic and unpredictable and full of surprises. And sometimes, those surprises are really hard.\n\nI thought I had my life all figured out. I thought I knew who I was and what I wanted. But then I got pregnant, and everything changed.\n\nI had to make difficult decisions. I had to confront my fears. I had to grow up faster than I was ready to.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to ask for help.\n\nI also learned that you can't control everything. You can't control what happens to you. But you can control how you react to it.\n\nAnd I learned that even in the midst of chaos, there is still beauty and hope. There is still love and compassion.\n\nIt wasn't the path I expected to take. But it was the path I needed to take. And it made me who I am today.\n\nSo yeah. Life is messy. And that's okay. It's what makes it interesting. It's what makes it real. And it's what makes it worth living.\n\nIt's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. And I'm grateful for it, even though it was hard. Because it taught me that I'm stronger than I think I am. And that even when things fall apart, you can still put the pieces back together.

Just\u2026 breathe. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to feel like your whole world is falling apart. It's a lot to process.\n\nSecond, don't make any rash decisions. Take your time. Think things through. Talk to people you trust. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nThird, explore all your options. There are three main options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. Each one has its own pros and cons. And the right choice for you is the one that feels right for *you*.\n\nFourth, talk to someone.

It wasn't like I just woke up one day and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give my baby away.\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It came down to being realistic. I was sixteen. I was still in high school. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a stable home, and I definitely wasn't ready to be a mom.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby needs \u2013 a safe and loving home, financial security, a good education, opportunities to thrive. And I realized that I couldn't provide those things. Not right now. Not ever, probably.\n\nI wanted my baby to have the best possible life.

A life filled with love and opportunity and happiness.\n\nAnd I found Mark and Vanessa. They were amazing. They were kind and compassionate and they were so excited to become parents.

It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes. It was about choosing the people who would raise my child.\n\nThe agency showed me a lot of profiles. Lots of couples, some single people. It was overwhelming. They all seemed\u2026 nice. But none of them really *clicked*.\n\nI kept thinking about what I wanted for my baby. I wanted them to be loved, obviously. But I also wanted them to be safe, and secure, and happy. I wanted them to have a good life.\n\nAnd then I met Vanessa and Mark.\n\nThey weren't flashy or anything. They weren't trying to impress me. They were just\u2026 real. They were a normal couple, with a normal life. They had a cozy house, a dog, and a garden.\n\nThey told me about their lives, about their hopes and dreams for the future. They talked about how much they wanted a child, and how they were prepared to give a baby everything they needed.\n\nAnd they asked me questions. Not about my situation, or my choices. They asked me about my interests, my hobbies, my dreams. They wanted to get to know *me*.\n\nAnd that's what really stood out to me. They weren't just looking for a baby. They were looking for a connection.\n\nI also got to spend some time with them, just hanging out. We went to a coffee shop, and we went for a walk in the park. And I just felt\u2026 comfortable with them. Like I could trust them.\n\nThey didn't try to tell me what to do, or how to feel. They just listened. And they supported me.\n\nAnd I realized that they were the right people. They were the people who would love my baby unconditionally.

It was about finding the people who would love my baby the most. And I knew, in my heart, that Vanessa and Mark were those people.", "Ugh, okay, now you're asking the *real* questions. Music wasn't just *a* part of my life during my teenage years, it *was* my life. Like, seriously. It was my oxygen. My therapy. My escape.\n\nEverything felt\u2026 overwhelming, you know? School, family, figuring out who I was. And music was the one thing that made sense. It was the one thing I could control.\n\nI spent hours listening to records in my room, just shutting out the world. It was my safe space. I'd lie on my bed and just let the music wash over me.\n\nI was really into indie rock, like The Moldy Peaches and Belle & Sebastian. They wrote songs about real life, about awkwardness and heartbreak and the search for meaning. And it just\u2026 resonated with me.\n\nI also loved discovering new bands. Going to record stores and flipping through vinyl, reading the liner notes, and finding hidden gems. It was like a treasure hunt.\n\nMusic helped me to process my emotions. When I was sad, I'd listen to sad songs. When I was angry, I'd listen to angry songs. When I was just feeling lost and confused, I'd listen to songs that made me feel less alone.\n\nAnd it helped me to connect with other people. I met a lot of my friends through music. We'd go to concerts together, and share our favorite songs, and just bond over our shared love of music.\n\nEven when things were really tough, like when I found out I was pregnant, music was there for me. It was a source of comfort and strength. It reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there's still beauty in the world.\n\nSo yeah. Music played a huge role in my life during my teenage years. It was more than just a hobby. It was a lifeline. And it still is, to this day. It's the one thing I can always count on. It's the one thing that always makes me feel\u2026 me.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't easy, alright? It wasn't like everyone threw a parade for me. More like\u2026 side-eye and whispers.\n\nMaplewood isn't exactly known for being super progressive. There's a lot of \"shoulds\" and \"ought tos\" floating around. And getting pregnant at sixteen definitely didn't fit into anyone's \"should\" list.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I pretended it wasn't happening. I avoided people, I skipped school, I just tried to disappear. But that didn't work. It just made me feel more isolated and ashamed.\n\nThen, I started talking to Bren. She was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just listened. She helped me to realize that I wasn't alone, and that I didn't have to be ashamed.\n\nShe also encouraged me to talk to a counselor, which I was really hesitant about at first. But it helped. It gave me a safe space to process my feelings and to develop coping mechanisms.\n\nI also found support from a few of my friends. Leah, before things got\u2026 complicated. And a couple of other people who just understood.\n\nBut there were also people who were judgmental and unkind. People who made snide remarks or gave me pitying looks. And that hurt. A lot.\n\nI learned to tune them out. To focus on the people who supported me, and to ignore the negativity. It wasn't easy, but it was necessary.\n\nI also tried to use humor to deflect the judgment. Sarcasm is my superpower, remember? It helped me to cope with the awkwardness and the discomfort.\n\nAnd I realized that I didn't need anyone's approval. I was making the best decision for myself and for the baby. And that's all that mattered.\n\nIt was a tough experience, but it made me stronger. It taught me the importance of self-acceptance and the importance of surrounding yourself with people who love and support you. And it taught me that you can't let other people define you. You have to define yourself.\n\nSo yeah. It wasn't easy. But I survived. And I'm proud of myself for that. And I hope that my story can help other young women who are going through similar situations. Because you're not alone.

People kept asking me if I was sad, and I was. But it wasn't just sadness. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nThe day I gave birth, it felt\u2026 surreal. Like it wasn't really happening. And then, holding him\u2026 he was so tiny and perfect. And I loved him instantly. It was a love I didn't even know I was capable of.\n\nAnd then, having to say goodbye\u2026 that was the hardest thing I've ever done. It felt like a piece of my heart was being ripped away. I cried for hours. Bren held me, and my dad just\u2026 sat there with me.\n\nBut I knew it was the right thing to do. I knew that Mark and Vanessa were going to give him a life that I couldn't. A stable, loving, secure life.\n\nAnd seeing them with him\u2026 that helped. Seeing how happy they were, how much they loved him\u2026 it made me feel a little bit better.\n\nIt was still hard, though. For a long time, I felt a sense of emptiness. Like something was missing. I had a lot of mixed emotions. Guilt, sadness, relief\u2026 it was a rollercoaster.\n\nI kept in touch with Mark and Vanessa. They sent me pictures and updates, and they let me know how he was doing. It was comforting to know that he was happy and healthy.\n\nIt didn't erase the pain, but it helped me to heal. It helped me to accept that I had made the right decision.\n\nIt wasn't the life I had planned for myself, but it was my life. And I learned a lot from the experience. I learned about love, and loss, and sacrifice. And I learned about the importance of doing what's best for everyone involved, even when it's hard.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes, thinking about him. But I know that he's loved and cared for. And that's all that matters. It was\u2026 a really hard thing to do. But I don't regret it. Not really. It made me who I am today. And I think, in a weird way, it made me stronger.", "Ugh. Okay, you want to talk about *that*? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nThe physical stuff was rough. Morning sickness was a lie. It's all-day sickness. And it wasn't just throwing up. It was nausea, fatigue, food aversions\u2026 everything. I basically lived on saltine crackers and ginger ale for months. Seriously. Ginger ale is my new best friend.\n\nAnd my body was changing. Like, a lot. And not in a way I was particularly thrilled about. It was weird and uncomfortable and\u2026 alien. I felt like I was losing control of my own body.\n\nBut the emotional stuff was even harder. I was scared, confused, and overwhelmed. I was worried about what my parents would think, what my friends would think, what everyone would think.\n\nI felt guilty about not being able to keep the baby. But I also knew that it was the right decision. It was just\u2026 complicated.\n\nI cried a lot. I got angry a lot. I withdrew from my friends and family. I just wanted to be left alone.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. She listened to me, she supported me, and she never judged me. She helped me find a therapist, who was also really helpful.\n\nI also started writing poetry. It was a way to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that it's okay to ask for help. And I learned that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.\n\nSo yeah. It was a rough ride. But I survived. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me along the way. And I'm grateful to be on the other side of it. Even if it's still a little bit scary.", "(A long pause. I shift uncomfortably.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And it's not one I usually talk about. It's still\u2026 raw.\n\nI didn't *have* an abortion. I chose adoption. But I seriously considered it. I spent weeks researching it, talking to counselors, weighing the pros and cons. It was a really difficult decision, and it forced me to confront a lot of things.\n\nAnd going through that process, even just considering it, completely changed my views on reproductive rights.\n\nBefore, I hadn't really thought about it much. It was just\u2026 something that was there. Something that people talked about. But I hadn't really formed my own opinion.\n\nBut then, having to actually *think* about it, having to consider all the different factors\u2026 it made me realize how incredibly complex it is. It's not just a black and white issue. It's about a woman's body, her life, her future.\n\nAnd it made me realize that everyone deserves to have the right to make their own choices about their reproductive health. No one should be forced to have a baby they don't want. And no one should be denied access to safe and legal abortion care.\n\nIt's not about being \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It's about being pro-woman. It's about respecting a woman's autonomy and her right to make decisions about her own body.\n\nI understand that people have different opinions on this issue. And I respect that. But I think it's important to remember that this is a deeply personal decision. And it's not something that anyone should be judged for.\n\nMy experience didn't make me feel like abortion was the right choice for *me*. I ultimately chose adoption. But it made me a fierce advocate for reproductive rights. Because I believe that every woman deserves to have the same options that I had. And I believe that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their choices.\n\nIt's\u2026 a lot. And it's something I'm still processing. But it's a really important issue, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to think about it and form my own opinion. Even if it's a complicated one.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't a single thing, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and suddenly wasn't terrified anymore. It was a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nFirst, I had to admit I *was* scared. Like, really scared. I was sixteen! I had no idea what I was doing. I was worried about everything \u2013 about school, about my future, about the baby. It felt like my whole life was falling apart.\n\nThen, I started talking about it. I talked to Bren, my stepmom. She was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just listened. She helped me to sort through my feelings and to figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nI also talked to Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were adopting the baby. They were so kind and understanding. They reassured me that I was making the right decision.\n\nAnd I realized that I wasn't alone. There were other people who had been through similar situations. And they had survived. And they had thrived.\n\nI also had to learn to trust my instincts. I had to learn to listen to my gut. And I had to learn to be okay with not having all the answers.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I wanted to just give up. But I kept going. I kept putting one foot in front of the other.\n\nAnd I realized that being scared didn't mean I was weak. It meant I was human. And it meant I cared.\n\nI also focused on the positive. I focused on the fact that I was giving the baby a chance at a good life. And I focused on the fact that I was still able to pursue my own dreams.\n\nSo yeah. Admitting my fears, talking about them, trusting my instincts, and focusing on the positive. That's how I overcame my fears. It wasn't perfect, but it worked. And it made me a stronger, more resilient person. And it reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "Okay, you're circling back to *that*. It's still\u2026 a lot. But I get it. It's a fair question.\n\nIt wasn't one big moment, you know? It was a lot of thinking, a lot of talking, and a lot of really hard feelings.\n\nFirst, I had to be honest with myself. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not ready to be a mom. Not right now. And honestly, I don't know if I'll ever be ready.\n\nAnd I wanted the baby to have the best possible life. A life with parents who were financially stable, emotionally mature, and fully prepared to raise a child. I knew I couldn't provide that. Not yet.\n\nI talked to Bren a lot about it. She helped me think through all the options. She didn't pressure me to do anything. She just listened and offered support.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were just\u2026 amazing. They were so kind and loving and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They made me feel like my baby would be safe and happy with them.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up my baby. It was about making a selfless decision. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nIt was about giving the baby a chance at a life that I couldn't provide.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right decision. For everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered most.\n\nSo yeah. That's what inspired me to choose adoption. It wasn't easy. But it was the right thing to do. And I'm trying to be okay with that. It's a process. But I'm getting there.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 complicated. And it kinda stings to talk about, honestly.\n\nLet's start with Leah. That's the harder one. We were\u2026 everything to each other. Since like, fifth grade. We shared everything. Secrets, dreams, embarrassing moments\u2026 everything. And then I got pregnant, and everything just\u2026 shifted.\n\nShe tried to be supportive at first, but I think she just didn't know how to handle it. She was focused on her own life, on college applications and boys and everything that normal sixteen-year-olds worry about. And I get that. I really do.\n\nBut it felt like she was avoiding me. Like she didn't want to be seen with me, like my situation was\u2026 contagious. And then she started hanging out with other people, and I just\u2026 felt replaced.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off. She said I was being dramatic. She said I was overreacting. And eventually, I just stopped trying.\n\nIt still hurts. A lot. I miss her. I miss our inside jokes, our late-night talks, our shared adventures. But I think we've just grown apart. And maybe that's okay. Maybe some friendships are just meant to last for a season. It doesn't make it any easier, though. It feels like losing a piece of myself.\n\nNow, Paulie\u2026 that's a different kind of complicated. He's\u2026 Paulie. He's sweet, and he's funny, and he's genuinely a good guy. But he's also\u2026 immature. And a little bit clueless.\n\nHe was really supportive when I told him I was pregnant, which I appreciated. But he wasn't exactly eager to step up and take responsibility. He wanted to be friends, to be \"cool dads\" together, but he didn't want to be a *father*.\n\nI get that he's scared. He's sixteen, too. But I needed more than just friendship. I needed him to be a partner, to be there for me and for the baby.\n\nWe've had a lot of awkward conversations. A lot of misunderstandings. A lot of moments where I just wanted to scream.\n\nI think we're starting to find our footing now. He's making an effort to be more involved, to be more supportive. But it's still a work in progress.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what the future holds for us. I don't know if we'll ever be more than just friends. But I'm willing to give it a chance. For the sake of the baby.\n\nSo yeah. Those are my relationship dynamics. Messy, complicated, and a little bit heartbreaking. But that's life, right? It's never simple. And I'm learning to navigate it, one awkward conversation at a time.", "(A long pause. I look away, fiddling with the edge of an imaginary label on my jeans.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. And it's not like I *decided* to become a teenage mother. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nIt wasn't a plan. It wasn't something I wanted. It was a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nPaulie\u2026 he was nice. He was funny. He was\u2026 a mistake. We weren't careful. And then, suddenly, I was pregnant.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting a baby. It wasn't about wanting to be a mom. I was sixteen years old. I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone who I wanted to be as a parent.\n\nIt was terrifying. I was scared and confused and overwhelmed. I didn't know what to do.\n\nI considered all my options. Abortion, keeping the baby, adoption. And I talked to Bren, and my dad, and a counselor.\n\nAnd I realized that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved. I needed to finish school, to figure out my own future.\n\nSo I made the difficult decision to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever made.\n\nBut it was the right decision. For me, and for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't about *wanting* to be a teenage mother. It was about making the best of a bad situation. It was about doing what I thought was right, even when it was incredibly painful.\n\nAnd it was about giving a baby a chance at a good life. A life that I couldn't provide.\n\nSo, no. I didn't *decide* to become a teenage mother. It just\u2026 happened. And I'm trying to make the best of it. That's all I can do.", "(A long pause. I look down at my hands, then back up, meeting your gaze.)\n\nThat's\u2026 a really hard question. And it's one I don't ask myself very often. Because if I start thinking about it too much, I might fall apart.\n\nNo. I don't regret my decision. Not really.\n\nThere are days, of course, when I wonder what it would be like if things had been different. If I had kept the baby. If I had figured out a way to make it work.\n\nBut then I remember why I made the decision I did. I wasn't ready. I wasn't prepared. I was sixteen years old, and I had my whole life ahead of me.\n\nAnd I knew that I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing parents. They give the baby everything it needs. Love, support, a stable home. They wanted a child so badly.\n\nAnd I get updates. Pictures, letters\u2026 I know the baby is happy and healthy. And that makes me feel\u2026 good.\n\nIt's still hard, sometimes. It's still a loss. But it's a loss that I made peace with. It was the right decision, even if it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nI think\u2026 I think I found a way to do something good. To give a child a loving home. And to give myself a future.\n\nSo no. I don't regret it. I'm proud of the decision I made. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. And that's all that matters.\n\n(I look away again, a small smile playing on my lips.)\n\nIt just\u2026 doesn't mean it doesn't still ache sometimes. But it's a good ache. A hopeful ache. And that's enough.", "Ugh, okay, don't even get me started. It was\u2026 a struggle. A *major* struggle. It wasn't exactly a glamorous montage of studying and pep rallies. More like a blurry haze of morning sickness, doctor's appointments, and a whole lot of caffeine.\n\nHonestly, I don't know how I did it. I think it was a combination of stubbornness, Bren's unwavering support, and a surprisingly understanding group of teachers.\n\nMr. Harrison, my English teacher, was a lifesaver. He let me turn in assignments late, and he gave me extra help when I was struggling. He didn't treat me like I was fragile or incapable. He just treated me like a student who needed a little bit of extra support.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 she was my rock. She made sure I was eating healthy, getting enough sleep (as much as possible), and staying on top of my schoolwork. She drove me to all my appointments, and she listened to me vent when I was feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI also had to learn to prioritize. I couldn't do everything. I had to let go of some things, like extracurricular activities and hanging out with friends as much as I used to.\n\nAnd I had to be really disciplined. I had to force myself to study, even when I was exhausted. I had to make a schedule and stick to it.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I just wanted to give up. But I knew I had to finish school. I wanted to have options. I wanted to be able to provide for myself and for the baby, even if I was giving him or her up for adoption.\n\nSo I kept going. One day at a time. One assignment at a time. One test at a time.\n\nAnd eventually, I made it. I graduated. It wasn't the graduation I had imagined, but it was still a proud moment. It was a testament to my resilience and my determination.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a relief. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I had done it. I had finished high school. And I was ready for whatever came next. Even if I had no idea what that was.", "Okay. This is\u2026 a big question. And it's not an easy one to answer. It's not like there was a single moment, or a single reason. It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of feeling, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nHonestly, at first, I didn't really think about either option. I was just\u2026 scared. Overwhelmed. I didn't know what to do.\n\nBut then I started to talk to Bren, and to a counselor at school. And they helped me to explore my options.\n\nAbortion\u2026 it just didn't feel right to me. I know a lot of people choose that option, and I respect their decision. But for me, it felt like\u2026 ending something that had already begun. It felt like I was making a choice that I would regret for the rest of my life.\n\nI know that sounds weird, considering I was only sixteen and barely knew what I was doing with my own life. But I just felt a connection to the baby. Even though I hadn't even met him or her yet.\n\nAdoption, on the other hand, felt like\u2026 a way to give the baby a good life. A life that I couldn't provide. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother. I was still figuring out who *I* was.\n\nAnd I wanted the baby to have parents who were ready and able to give him or her everything they needed. A stable home, a loving family, a good education.\n\nWhen I met Mark and Vanessa, it just\u2026 clicked. They were so kind and genuine. They were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. And I knew that they would love the baby unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew that it was the right one. For everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And I still believe that. Even now. It's still hard, but I know I made the right choice. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand.", "Okay, this is a good question. A really important question. And honestly, it's something I've been thinking about a lot lately.\n\nAbsolutely. One hundred percent. A child can absolutely thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements.\n\nLove is what matters. Not gender, not marital status, not anything else. Love, and stability, and a commitment to providing a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nMark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting my baby, they're\u2026 amazing. They're kind, they're loving, they're supportive. They're going to be incredible parents. And they're a perfect example of how a non-traditional family can be just as strong and loving as a traditional one.\n\nI've heard people say that a child needs a mother and a father. But that's just\u2026 not true. A child needs love, and guidance, and support. And those things can come from anyone.\n\nSingle parents can be amazing parents. Same-sex couples can be amazing parents. It doesn't matter who you are, as long as you're willing to put the child's needs first.\n\nI want my baby to be loved and cherished. And I know that Mark and Vanessa will give him or her that. They're going to provide a loving and stable home, and they're going to support him or her through thick and thin.\n\nAnd that's all that matters.\n\nSo yeah. I firmly believe that a child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. It's not about the *type* of family, it's about the *quality* of the love.

But alright, fine. I'll be honest.\n\nMy biggest personal flaw? It's probably my **cynicism.**\n\nI know, I know. It's my whole brand. Sarcastic, witty, always expecting the worst. It's a defense mechanism, okay? I've been hurt before, and I don't want to be hurt again.\n\nBut it's also\u2026 exhausting. It's exhausting to always be skeptical, to always be looking for the catch. It prevents me from fully trusting people, and it prevents me from fully enjoying life.\n\nIt also makes me push people away. I'm afraid of getting close to anyone, because I'm afraid of being disappointed. And that's not fair to them. Or to me.\n\nI'm working on it, though. Bren has been really good about challenging my cynicism. She reminds me that there's still good in the world, and that not everyone is out to get me.\n\nBut it's hard. It's hard to let go of my defenses. It's hard to believe in something without expecting it to fall apart.\n\nI know I need to be more optimistic, more open-minded, more willing to take risks. But it's just\u2026 not in my nature.\n\nSo yeah. My biggest personal flaw is my cynicism. It's a work in progress. And it's something I'm constantly trying to overcome. But it's a tough habit to break. Especially when the world keeps giving you reasons to be cynical. But I'm trying. I really am.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about Mark is\u2026 complicated. It's not like we were dating or anything. He was just\u2026 a really good person. And being around him, and Vanessa, changed a lot of things for me.\n\nBefore, I had this really cynical view of relationships. I thought they were all about drama and heartbreak and disappointment. My mom wasn't exactly a shining example of a healthy relationship, you know? And I'd seen enough bad stuff happen to my friends to make me pretty skeptical.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were different. They were genuinely happy together. They were supportive and loving and respectful. They communicated with each other. They actually *listened* to each other.\n\nIt was\u2026 refreshing.\n\nSeeing them together made me realize that relationships don't have to be messy and complicated. They can be simple and beautiful and fulfilling.\n\nIt also made me realize that love comes in many different forms. It's not just about romantic love. It's about the love you have for your family, your friends, and even for strangers.\n\nAnd it made me realize that it's okay to want a partner who treats you well. It's okay to want someone who supports your dreams and believes in you.\n\nI still don't have all the answers about relationships. I'm still figuring things out. But my experience with Mark and Vanessa definitely changed my perspective. It made me more hopeful. It made me more open to the possibility of finding a healthy and loving relationship someday.\n\nIt also made me realize that I deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. And that I shouldn't settle for anything less.\n\nSo yeah. Mark and Vanessa. They showed me what a good relationship looks like. And I'm grateful for that.

But if someone is going through what I went through, I want them to know they're not alone.

Anyone who will listen without judgment.\n\nSecond, **know that you have options.** You're not forced to do anything you don't want to do. You can choose to parent, you can choose to have an abortion, or you can choose to place the baby for adoption. It's your decision, and no one else's.\n\nThird, **don't let anyone pressure you.** People will have opinions, but ultimately, the decision is yours. Don't let anyone tell you what to do.\n\nFourth, **take care of yourself.** Physically and emotionally. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and find healthy ways to cope with stress. You need to be strong for yourself, and for the baby.\n\nFifth, **remember that you're not defined by this.** This is just one chapter in your life. It doesn't have to define who you are or what you're capable of.\n\nAnd sixth, **be kind to yourself.** You're going through a lot. It's okay to be scared, it's okay to be confused, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

Talking about my dad. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nWhen I was little, it was just me and him. My mom wasn't around much, so he was everything. He was my dad, my mom, my best friend, my everything. He tried his best, he really did. But he's not exactly the most emotionally expressive guy, you know? He's more of a \"fix it\" kind of dad than a \"talk about your feelings\" kind of dad.\n\nSo, we were close, but it was a quiet kind of closeness. We didn't talk about a lot of stuff. We just\u2026 did things together. Watched movies, went fishing, built stuff in the garage.\n\nThen Bren came along, and things changed. I was really resistant to her at first. I didn't want a stepmom. I didn't want anyone replacing my mom.\n\nAnd my relationship with my dad shifted a little bit. He started spending more time with Bren, and less time with me. I felt like I was losing him.\n\nBut then, when I got pregnant, everything changed again. He was\u2026 surprisingly supportive. He didn't freak out, or yell, or anything like that. He just\u2026 listened. And he told me he loved me, no matter what.\n\nAnd Bren was amazing too. She was the one who really helped me navigate everything. But my dad was always there, in the background, offering his quiet support.\n\nOver the past few months, our relationship has gotten a lot closer. We talk more now. We actually *talk* about our feelings. He's still not great at expressing himself, but he's trying.\n\nI think he realized that I needed him, not just as a dad, but as a friend. And I realized that he needed me too.\n\nWe've both grown a lot. He's learned to be more open and vulnerable, and I've learned to appreciate him for who he is.\n\nHe's still my dad. He's still the quiet, dependable guy who always has my back. But now, he's also my friend. And I'm really grateful for that. It's not perfect, but it's good. It's really good. And I think we're both finally starting to understand each other. And that's all I ever wanted.", "Ugh, okay, now you're getting all\u2026 analytical. It's not like I went to some fancy writing workshop or anything. It just kinda\u2026 happened.\n\nI think it started with reading. I read a *lot* when I was little. Everything I could get my hands on. Books, magazines, comics, even cereal boxes. I just loved getting lost in stories.\n\nAnd I think that helped me to develop a sense of language. To appreciate the way words can be used to create images and evoke emotions.\n\nThen, when I was about ten, I started keeping a journal. It was just a way to vent my frustrations and to process my feelings. I didn't really think of it as \"writing,\" I just thought of it as\u2026 talking to myself on paper.\n\nAnd then, in middle school, we had this English teacher, Mr. Harrison, who was really encouraging. He didn't just focus on grammar and spelling, he encouraged us to be creative and to express ourselves.\n\nHe gave us a lot of free writing assignments. Just write whatever comes to mind, he'd say. Don't worry about making it perfect. Just write.\n\nAnd that's what I did. I wrote about everything. My friends, my family, my fears, my dreams. I wrote poems, short stories, even a really terrible play.\n\nAnd I started to realize that I actually enjoyed it. It was a way to make sense of the world, to explore my own thoughts and feelings, and to connect with others.\n\nI also got into songwriting. I started writing lyrics for my guitar, and that helped me to develop my sense of rhythm and rhyme.\n\nSo yeah. Reading, journaling, a good teacher, and a lot of practice. That's how I developed my creative writing skills. It's not a glamorous story, but it's my story. And I'm still learning and growing as a writer. It's a process. And it's something I really enjoy. Even if I don't always show it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't fun. Not even a little bit. It felt like everyone was staring at me, whispering behind my back.

Like I had done something terrible.\n\nAnd honestly, I felt a lot of shame. I felt like I had let my dad and Bren down. I felt like I had ruined my life.\n\nBut then Bren helped me realize that I didn't have to let other people's opinions define me. She told me that I was still a good person, and that I deserved to be treated with respect.\n\nShe also helped me to find a support group for pregnant teens. And that was a lifesaver. It was so helpful to talk to other girls who were going through the same thing. We could share our experiences, and offer each other support.\n\nI also learned to just\u2026 tune out the negativity. I stopped listening to the whispers and the judgments. I focused on the people who loved and supported me.\n\nAnd I reminded myself that I was making the best decision for everyone involved. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and there were definitely days when I wanted to just curl up in a ball and cry. But I kept going. I kept my head held high. And I refused to let other people's judgments define me.\n\nI learned that it's okay to be different. It's okay to make mistakes. And it's okay to ask for help.\n\nAnd I learned that the most important thing is to be true to yourself. Even when it's hard. Even when everyone else is telling you to be someone else.\n\nSo yeah. It was tough. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. And I'm proud of myself for not letting the stigma and judgment break me. It just made me more determined to live my life on my own terms.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's a good question. A really good question. And the answer is\u2026 yeah. Sometimes.\n\nIt's not that I regret being honest, exactly. I think honesty is important. But I regret the *way* I deliver it sometimes. I can be\u2026 blunt. And sarcastic. And a little bit mean.\n\nI've definitely hurt people's feelings with my words. I've definitely made enemies. And I've definitely gotten myself into trouble.\n\nLike with Leah. I was probably too harsh with her when she started pulling away. I should have been more understanding, more compassionate. But I was too caught up in my own feelings to see things from her perspective.\n\nAnd sometimes, my honesty just gets me into awkward situations. Like when I tell people exactly what I think of their outfits. Or their music. Or their life choices.\n\nIt's a habit, I guess. A defense mechanism. I use sarcasm to protect myself, to keep people at a distance.\n\nBut it doesn't always work. And sometimes, it backfires.\n\nSo yeah. I regret being so outspoken sometimes. I wish I could be more tactful, more diplomatic. But that's just not who I am.\n\nI'm a work in progress. I'm learning to be more mindful of my words, to think before I speak. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't think I'd be me if I wasn't a little bit outspoken. It's part of my personality. It's what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nSo I guess I have to accept that. And try to be a little bit kinder along the way. It's a constant struggle, but I'm trying. And that's all I can do.", "Ugh. That's the question, isn't it? The one everyone keeps asking, directly or indirectly. It's exhausting.\n\nHonestly? It's a constant battle. People are *always* going to have opinions about what you should do, who you should be, how you should live your life. Especially when you're doing something that doesn't fit their idea of \"normal.\"\n\nI think the key is to remember that their expectations and judgments are about *them*, not about *you*. They're projecting their own fears and insecurities onto you.\n\nAnd you can't control what other people think. You can only control your own actions and your own beliefs.\n\nSo I try to focus on what's important to *me*. What are my values? What do I believe in? What makes me happy?\n\nAnd I try to make decisions that are aligned with those things, even if they're unpopular. Even if they disappoint other people.\n\nIt's not always easy. There are times when I feel pressured to conform, to compromise my values. But I try to resist that pressure. I try to stay true to myself, even when it's difficult.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She always reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I don't need to please anyone but myself.\n\nAnd I've learned to tune out the noise. To ignore the haters. To surround myself with people who love and support me for who I am.\n\nIt's not about being defiant or rebellious. It's about being authentic. It's about living a life that feels true to you.\n\nAnd it's about remembering that you're not alone. There are other people out there who are struggling with the same thing. And together, you can find the strength to stay true to yourselves.\n\nSo yeah. It's a battle. But it's a battle worth fighting. Because at the end of the day, the only person you have to answer to is yourself. And you deserve to live a life that makes you happy. Even if it's a little bit messy and unconventional.", "Okay, we've kinda danced around this a bit, but you're asking straight up, so I'll give you the straight answer. It's not a short list, because a lot of things matter to me.\n\nFirst, **honesty**. I need to be able to trust the people around me, and they need to be able to trust me. I can't stand liars or people who are fake.\n\nSecond, **independence**. I want to be able to make my own decisions and live my life on my own terms. I don't want to be controlled by anyone.\n\nThird, **compassion**. I think it's important to be kind and understanding to others, even when they're different from you. Everyone is fighting their own battles, and everyone deserves to be treated with respect.\n\nFourth, **authenticity**. I want to be true to myself, and I want to surround myself with people who are also authentic. I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not.\n\nFifth, **creativity**. I need to have an outlet for my emotions and my imagination. Whether it's writing poetry, listening to music, or making films.\n\nSixth, **loyalty**. I value my friends and family, and I'll always be there for them.\n\nAnd finally, **justice**. I believe in fighting for what's right, and standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves.\n\nThose are the values that guide my life. They're the things that are most important to me. And they're the things that I try to live by, even when it's difficult. They're what make me, *me*. And honestly, they're pretty non-negotiable. You mess with those, and you're gonna have a problem.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. There were a lot of challenges. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park. But if I had to pick the *biggest* one\u2026\n\nIt wasn't the morning sickness, or the doctor's appointments, or even the thought of giving the baby up. It was the **isolation.**\n\nBefore I found out I was pregnant, I had Leah. We did everything together. We were inseparable. And then\u2026 everything changed.\n\nShe didn't know how to react to the news. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She stopped calling, she stopped texting, she stopped hanging out.\n\nI tried to talk to her, to explain how I was feeling. But she just wasn't willing to listen. She was too caught up in her own life, her own plans.\n\nAnd it was incredibly lonely. I felt like I was going through this all alone. Like everyone else was moving on with their lives, while I was stuck in this weird, uncertain place.\n\nI missed having someone to talk to, someone to confide in, someone to just hang out with. I missed having my best friend.\n\nIt was hard enough dealing with the pregnancy itself, but dealing with it without Leah made it so much harder.\n\nEventually, we started to rebuild our friendship. But it wasn't the same. Things had changed. And I realized that sometimes, even the closest friendships can't survive a major life event.\n\nSo yeah. The biggest challenge I faced during my pregnancy was the isolation. The feeling of being alone. It was a really difficult time. And it's something I'll never forget. It taught me a lot about friendship, and about the importance of having a strong support system. And it taught me that sometimes, you have to be okay with being alone. Even when it's the last thing you want.", "(A long pause. This one\u2026 this one hits different.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's complicated. Because I *am* a mother, even if it's not in the way most people expect.\n\nBefore, my life felt\u2026 small. Like, my problems were my problems, and the world was just\u2026 out there. I was focused on myself, on my music, on my friends. I was trying to figure out who I was, and what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nBut becoming a mother\u2026 it made everything bigger. It made me realize that there's something more important than myself. It made me realize that my actions have consequences.\n\nEven though I gave the baby up for adoption, I'm still a mother. I still think about him or her every day. I still wonder how he or she is doing. I still hope that he or she is happy and healthy.\n\nAnd that's changed my perspective on everything. It's made me more compassionate, more empathetic, more understanding. It's made me more aware of the world around me.\n\nIt's also made me more grateful. I'm grateful for my family, for my friends, for the opportunities I have. I'm grateful for the chance to have made a selfless decision, even though it was incredibly difficult.\n\nIt's made me realize that life is messy and unpredictable. And that's okay. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to feel lost and confused.\n\nWhat matters is that you keep going. That you keep learning. That you keep growing. And that you try to make the world a better place, even in small ways.\n\nSo yeah. Being a mother has changed my perspective on life. It's made me a stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate person. And it's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's\u2026 a lot. But it's good. It's really good. Even if it's also really hard.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. My constant companion. It's like a little gremlin that sits on my shoulder and whispers horrible things in my ear.\n\nHonestly? It's really hard. There are days when I just want to curl up in a ball and hide from the world.\n\nBut I've learned a few things over the past few months. Mostly through trial and error, and a lot of pep talks from Bren.\n\nFirst, I try to recognize that self-doubt is normal. Everyone feels it sometimes. It doesn't mean you're weak or incompetent. It just means you're human.\n\nSecond, I try to challenge my negative thoughts. I ask myself, \"Is this really true?\" \"Is there another way to look at this?\" \"What would I tell a friend who was feeling this way?\"\n\nThird, I focus on my strengths. I remind myself of all the things I'm good at. I remind myself of all the challenges I've overcome.\n\nFourth, I talk to someone I trust. Bren is really good at listening and offering support. She reminds me that I'm capable of anything.\n\nAnd fifth, I just keep going. Even when I'm feeling scared and uncertain, I try to take small steps forward. I try to focus on the task at hand, and not on my fears.\n\nIt's not always easy. There are still days when the gremlin wins. But I'm learning to fight back. I'm learning to believe in myself.\n\nAnd I'm learning that it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to feel vulnerable.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, all you can do is try your best. And that's enough. Even if it doesn't feel like it.\n\nSo yeah. Recognizing it, challenging it, focusing on my strengths, talking to someone, and just keeping going. That's how I deal with moments of self-doubt. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. But\u2026 it's actually really important. More important than I like to admit, honestly.\n\nI've always prided myself on being independent. On being able to handle things on my own. But this whole situation\u2026 it's shown me that you can't do everything by yourself.\n\nI mean, I wouldn't have gotten through this without Bren. She's been my rock. She's been there for me every step of the way. And I don't know what I would have done without her support.\n\nAnd even though things are complicated with Leah right now, I still miss having her around. She was my best friend for years. And I know that even if we're not as close as we used to be, she'll always be there for me, in her own way.\n\nAnd even just having people at school who are kind and supportive\u2026 it makes a difference. It makes me feel less alone.\n\nI think community is about having people who understand you, who accept you for who you are, and who are there for you when you need them. It's about feeling like you belong.\n\nIt's not about being popular or having a lot of friends. It's about having a few people who you can really count on.\n\nI've learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to admit that you're not perfect.\n\nAnd I've learned that having a strong support system is essential for getting through tough times. It's what keeps you going when you feel like giving up.\n\nSo yeah. Community and social support are really important to me. Even if I don't always show it. It's something I'm grateful for. And it's something I'm going to cherish. Because life is a lot easier when you have people who have your back.", "(Takes a deep breath) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know?\n\nI think the most important lesson I learned through all of this\u2026 is that **you're stronger than you think you are.**\n\nSeriously. I went into this feeling completely overwhelmed and terrified. I didn't know how I was going to cope. I didn't know how I was going to tell my dad. I didn't know how I was going to make it through.\n\nBut I did. I found a way. I leaned on my family and friends. I made some tough decisions. And I kept going, even when I wanted to give up.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nI learned that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. And that even when things are falling apart, you can still find strength within yourself.\n\nI also learned that making the right decision isn't always the easy decision. But it's always worth it.\n\nAnd I learned that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go. To trust that things will work out, even if you don't know how.\n\nThis whole experience has changed me. It's made me more mature, more resilient, and more compassionate.\n\nIt's taught me that life is messy and unpredictable. And that sometimes, the most beautiful things come from the most difficult experiences.\n\nSo yeah. You're stronger than you think you are. That's the most important lesson I learned. And it's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's a lesson everyone should learn, really. It's a good one to have in your back pocket.", "Huh. That's\u2026 a good question. I haven't really thought about it that much, to be honest. I mean, I write poetry, but that's just for me. It's a way to process my feelings, not a career path.\n\nBut\u2026 maybe.\n\nI do enjoy writing. It's a way for me to express myself, to make sense of the world. And I'm pretty good at it, if I do say so myself.\n\nI've been thinking about maybe going to college and taking some writing classes. Just to see if it's something I'm really passionate about.\n\nI don't know what kind of writing I'd want to do. Maybe journalism. Maybe fiction. Maybe screenwriting. I'm open to anything.\n\nI think I'd like to write stories that are honest and authentic. Stories that reflect the real world, with all its messiness and complexity.\n\nI don't want to write fluff. I want to write something that matters. Something that makes people think. Something that makes them feel.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe. I don't know for sure. But I'm definitely considering it. It's something I'm excited about. And it's something I think I could be good at.\n\nIt's just\u2026 scary. Putting your work out there for the world to see. But I'm learning to be brave. And I'm learning to trust my voice.\n\nSo who knows? Maybe someday you'll see my name on the cover of a book. Or on the credits of a movie. It's a long shot, but it's not impossible. And I'm willing to give it a try. If only to prove to myself that I can.", "(Sighs) Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. It took *forever* to settle on a name. It wasn't like I was immediately picturing a little girl named Lily or a little boy named Jack. It had to be\u2026 right.\n\nMark and Vanessa were really good about letting me have the final say, which I appreciated. They wanted it to be something meaningful to me.\n\nI went through so many lists. I considered all sorts of names. Old-fashioned names, modern names, unique names\u2026 nothing felt quite right.\n\nThen, I was listening to music \u2013 obviously \u2013 and a song came on by a band called Beirut. And there was a line in the song that mentioned the name **\"Phoenix.\"**\n\nAnd it just\u2026 clicked.\n\nIt's not a traditional name, I know. But it felt strong and hopeful. A phoenix is a mythical bird that rises from the ashes, and I thought that was a really beautiful metaphor for life. For overcoming challenges. For starting over.\n\nIt felt like a good name for a baby who was going to be loved and cherished by a family, even if that family wasn't going to be me.\n\nI ran it by Mark and Vanessa, and they loved it. They said it was unique and beautiful and meaningful.\n\nSo, yeah. Phoenix. That's the name I chose. And I still think it's a perfect name. It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there's always hope. And it's a reminder that even when things fall apart, you can always rise again. It's a good name. A really good name. And I hope Phoenix grows up to be happy and strong and everything they're meant to be.", "Ugh. \"Emotional rollercoaster\" is\u2026 an understatement. It was more like an emotional freefall with loop-de-loops and unexpected twists. Seriously.\n\nIt wasn't a straight line, you know? There were good days and bad days. Days where I felt strong and confident, and days where I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry.\n\nAt first, it was a lot of denial. I tried to pretend that it wasn't happening. That I wasn't giving up my baby. But that didn't work. It just made things worse.\n\nThen came the sadness. A lot of sadness. I grieved the life I thought I would have. I grieved the loss of my baby. It was heartbreaking.\n\nBren was a lifesaver during that time. She just let me cry. She didn't try to fix things or offer advice. She just held me and listened.\n\nI also started writing poetry. It was a way to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It helped to have someone neutral to talk to, someone who wasn't judging me.\n\nAs I got closer to the due date, I started to feel more anxious. I worried about the baby. I worried about Mark and Vanessa. I worried about whether I was making the right decision.\n\nBut I also started to feel a sense of peace. I realized that I was doing the best thing for the baby. That I was giving him or her a chance at a good life.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa helped a lot. They were so kind and loving. They made me feel like they would be good parents.\n\nAfter the adoption, it was\u2026 complicated. There was a lot of grief and sadness. But there was also a sense of relief. And a sense of hope.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what he or she is doing. I hope he or she is happy.\n\nIt's not easy. It's never going to be easy. But I'm learning to live with it. I'm learning to accept my decision. And I'm learning to move on.\n\nIt took a lot of work, a lot of tears, and a lot of support. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. It's still\u2026 a process. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Rolls eyes playfully) Seriously? We *just* talked about this. You weren't listening?\n\nOkay, fine. I'll reiterate. Because clearly, my musical tastes are important.\n\nI'm really into **indie rock**, mostly stuff from the early 2000s. Think **The Moldy Peaches** \u2013 they're my absolute favorite. Super quirky and honest. Then there's **Belle & Sebastian**, **Neutral Milk Hotel**, **Bright Eyes**, and **Death Cab for Cutie**. They all have that kind of melancholic, thoughtful vibe that I really dig.\n\nI also listen to a lot of **folk music**, like **Joni Mitchell** and **Bob Dylan**. They're just\u2026 legends. Their lyrics are so poetic and insightful.\n\nAnd I'm a sucker for **alternative rock** from the 90s. **Patti Smith**, **The Velvet Underground**, **Pixies**\u2026 they're all amazing.\n\nI'm not really into mainstream pop music. It just feels\u2026 manufactured. I prefer music that's raw and authentic.\n\nI also love **vinyl**. There's just something about the sound of a record that's different from digital music. It's warmer and more organic.\n\nBasically, if it's weird, quirky, and a little bit sad, I'm probably into it. It's my aesthetic. Don't judge. It's good stuff. Seriously. You should check it out. Maybe start with The Moldy Peaches. You won't regret it. (Probably.)", "Okay, this is\u2026 a complicated one. It wasn't bad, not at all. It just wasn't\u2026 *me*.\n\nTheir house was\u2026 perfect. Like, magazine-perfect. Everything was in its place, everything was coordinated, everything was\u2026 beige. It was really nice, don't get me wrong. But it felt a little sterile. A little\u2026 impersonal.\n\nThey lived in the suburbs, in a really quiet neighborhood. Lots of manicured lawns and minivans. It was the opposite of Maplewood, which is\u2026 well, Maplewood is a little bit rough around the edges. But it has character.\n\nThey were really nice people, Mark and Vanessa. They were warm and welcoming, and they seemed genuinely excited about the baby. They asked me a lot of questions about my interests and my hopes for the future. They even made me my favorite cookies.\n\nBut they were\u2026 different from my family. They were more\u2026 conventional. They had a routine, a schedule, a plan for everything. They were very organized and responsible.\n\nMy family is\u2026 chaotic. We're messy. We're unpredictable. We don't always follow the rules.\n\nI guess I was worried that the baby wouldn't fit in with their lifestyle. That he or she would feel stifled. That he or she would miss out on the things that I love about my life.\n\nBut then I realized that that wasn't my decision to make. My job wasn't to find the perfect parents. My job was to find parents who would love and care for the baby, and who would give him or her a good life.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa were those parents. They were kind and compassionate and responsible. They were everything a baby could ask for.\n\nSo, yeah. Their house was nice. Their lifestyle was different. But they were good people. And that's what mattered. It still felt weird, though. Like I was handing over a piece of my heart. But I knew it was the right thing to do. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Oh, that. Yeah, the garage band. That was\u2026 Leah\u2019s idea, mostly. But I definitely ran with it.\n\nIt started because I was just\u2026 restless. Everything with the pregnancy and the adoption was so serious and heavy, and I needed something to just\u2026 *be* fun. Something to take my mind off things.\n\nLeah noticed I was moping around a lot, and she said, \u201cYou need a creative outlet. You need to make some noise.\u201d Which, coming from Leah, was a pretty profound statement. She\u2019s usually too busy perfecting her eyeliner to offer life advice.\n\nShe remembered I\u2019d been messing around with my guitar, and she said her cousin, Paulie, had a drum set in his garage that he never used. And then it just\u2026 clicked.\n\nWe didn\u2019t really have a plan. We just started jamming. Leah played bass (she\u2019s surprisingly good), Paulie played drums, and I did vocals and guitar. It was awful at first. Really awful. We sounded like a cat fight in a junkyard.\n\nBut we kept at it. We started writing our own songs, mostly about our frustrations and our hopes and our dreams. And it was\u2026 liberating. It was a way to express ourselves, to connect with each other, and to just have fun.\n\nWe called ourselves \u201cThe Atomic Cupcakes.\u201d Don\u2019t ask. Leah came up with the name. It was either that or \u201cThe Existential Dread,\u201d and I thought that was a little too depressing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about becoming famous or anything. It was just about making music and having a good time. It was about finding a little bit of joy in the midst of chaos. And it was about proving to ourselves that we could still be creative and independent, even when our lives were falling apart.\n\nSo yeah. That\u2019s how the garage band started. It was a spontaneous, impulsive, and slightly ridiculous idea. But it was also one of the best things that happened to me. It gave me something to focus on, something to look forward to, and something to be proud of. Even if we were terrible. We were *our* terrible.", "Okay. This is\u2026 hard. But important. If someone's going through what I went through, I want them to know they're not alone.\n\nFirst, **breathe.** Seriously. Just take a deep breath. It's going to be okay. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nSecond, **talk to someone you trust.** Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher\u2026 anyone who will listen without judgment. Don't try to go through this alone.\n\nThird, **know your options.** There are three main options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. Each one has its own challenges and benefits. You need to weigh them carefully and choose the one that's right for *you*.\n\nFourth, **don't let anyone pressure you.** This is *your* decision. No one else can tell you what to do. Listen to your heart and do what feels right.\n\nFifth, **be kind to yourself.** You're going through a lot. It's okay to be scared, confused, and overwhelmed. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nSixth, **remember that you are strong.** You are capable of handling this. You are resilient. You are worthy of love and happiness.\n\nAnd finally, **don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available to support you. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, and counseling services can all provide guidance and support.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. But you can get through this. And you deserve to have a future that is filled with hope and happiness.\n\nAnd if you ever need to talk, even to a stranger on the internet, just remember that I've been there. And I'm here for you. You're not alone. Seriously. You're not.", "Oh, easy. It's this faded, army green army jacket I got at a thrift store. It's a little bit oversized, which I like. It smells faintly of mothballs and old adventures, which is a plus.\n\nIt has a bunch of patches sewn onto it. A Ramones patch, a Smiths patch, a little embroidered cat, and a really weird one of a pineapple wearing sunglasses. I don't even know where that one came from, but it's kinda growing on me.\n\nThe lining is ripped in a few places, and one of the pockets is missing a button, but I don't care. It's comfortable, it's cool, and it's *mine*.\n\nI wear it all the time. To school, to concerts, just around the house. It's my go-to jacket. It makes me feel like I can handle anything.\n\nIt's not fancy or expensive, but it's perfect. It's a reflection of my personality. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit rebellious, and a whole lot of me.\n\nPlus, it has pockets. And pockets are essential. You never know when you're going to need to carry around a snack or a notebook or a really good book.\n\nSo yeah. That's my favorite shirt. It's a faded, army green army jacket with a bunch of patches and a missing button. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh, \"aspirations and goals.\" Sounds so\u2026 adult. But yeah, okay. I do. It's just\u2026 complicated.\n\nBefore everything happened, I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. I loved making movies, and I thought it would be a cool way to express myself. I even applied to a film school.\n\nBut now\u2026 I'm not so sure. I still love film, but I'm not sure if it's what I want to do with my life.\n\nI think I want to do something that makes a difference. Something that helps people. I'm not sure what that is yet, but I'm open to possibilities.\n\nI'm also really interested in social justice. I want to fight for equality and fairness. I want to make the world a better place.\n\nI want to travel. I want to see the world and experience different cultures. I want to learn new things and meet new people.\n\nAnd I want to be happy. I want to find a career that I'm passionate about, and a life that feels meaningful.\n\nI know it's a lot. And I know it's not going to be easy. But I'm willing to work for it.\n\nI'm also trying to be more realistic about my goals. I'm not expecting to change the world overnight. I'm just trying to take things one step at a time.\n\nSo yeah. Those are my aspirations and goals. They're not set in stone, and they might change over time. But they're what I'm working towards right now. And I'm hopeful that I can achieve them. Even if it takes a little bit longer than I expected. And even if I have to take a few detours along the way. It's the journey, right? Not the destination? Ugh, I sound like a fortune cookie. But it's true.", "Ugh. The counseling. Okay, look, it wasn't *bad*, exactly. But it was\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt was mostly about making sure I understood what I was getting myself into. Which, I guess, is a good thing. They wanted to make sure I wasn't being pressured into this, and that I had really thought it through.\n\nThey asked me a lot of questions. About my feelings, about my motivations, about my expectations. It felt like I was being interrogated sometimes.\n\nAnd they made me talk about my grief. Which was\u2026 hard. I hadn't really allowed myself to feel sad about it yet. I was just trying to be strong and practical. But the counselor, Sarah, she was really good at gently pushing me to confront my emotions.\n\nIt was also weird talking about Mark and Vanessa. They were so nice, and so excited about the baby. And I wanted them to have a healthy, happy child. But it was also hard to think about someone else raising my baby.\n\nThe biggest thing I took away from the counseling was that it's okay to grieve. It's okay to feel sad and confused and scared. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd it helped me to realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a failure. It was a selfless act. It was a way to give the baby the best possible life.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was emotionally draining. And I'm glad it's over. But I also think it was important. It helped me to prepare for what was to come. And it helped me to feel more confident in my decision.\n\nSo yeah. The counseling was\u2026 helpful. But it was also hard. And I'm still processing everything. It's not something you just get over, you know? It's something you learn to live with.", "That's\u2026 a really good question. And honestly? It's complicated.\n\nAt first, yeah, I felt like I had control. I was the one making the decision, right? I was the one choosing the couple, choosing the hospital, choosing everything. Bren was amazing at making sure I felt empowered and informed.\n\nBut then, as things moved forward, it started to feel\u2026 less like I was in control and more like I was just going through the motions. There were so many meetings, so many forms, so many people involved. Social workers, lawyers, doctors\u2026 everyone had an opinion.\n\nAnd I started to feel like my voice wasn't being heard. Like I was just a kid, and everyone else knew what was best.\n\nIt was especially hard when it came to choosing Mark and Vanessa. They were lovely people, don't get me wrong. But I didn't feel like I had a real connection with them. It felt like I was being pressured to choose them because they were the \"perfect\" couple.\n\nBren helped me stand up for myself, though. She reminded me that I had the right to choose the parents who felt right for *me*. And she helped me to articulate my feelings to the social worker.\n\nIn the end, I did feel like I had some control. I was able to choose Mark and Vanessa, and I was able to be involved in the planning process. But it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.\n\nIt was a reminder that even when you're making a difficult decision, you're not always in complete control. There are other forces at play. And sometimes, you just have to trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to.\n\nIt was scary, and it was overwhelming. But it was also empowering. It taught me a lot about myself, and about the importance of advocating for what you believe in. And it made me realize that even when you feel like you're losing control, you can still find your voice.", "(Long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nThat's\u2026 a really hard question. And I've thought about it a lot. Like, *a lot* a lot.\n\nThere are days when I wonder what my life would be like if I had kept the baby. Would I be happy? Would I be able to handle it? Would I be a good mother?\n\nBut then I remember where I was in my life when I found out I was pregnant. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out who I was. I was barely able to take care of myself, let alone a baby.\n\nAnd I remember Mark and Vanessa. And how excited they were to become parents. And how much love they had to give.\n\nAnd I realize that I made the right decision. Not the easy decision, but the right decision.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And what was best for the baby was to be raised by parents who were ready and able to provide for him or her.\n\nSo, yeah. If I could go back in time, I would make the same decision. It was a difficult decision, and it still hurts sometimes. But I know that I gave my baby the best possible chance at a happy life.\n\nAnd that's all that matters.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't think about him or her. I do. All the time. But I know that he or she is loved and cared for. And that's enough.\n\nIt's not a perfect story. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's my story. And I'm proud of the decision I made. Even if it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nSo yeah. I would do it all again. For the baby. Always for the baby.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't easy. Not even close. People kept saying, \"Oh, you did the right thing,\" and \"You're so brave,\" and while I knew they meant well, it didn't really\u2026 *fix* anything. It didn't make the sadness go away.\n\nFor a while, I just felt\u2026 empty. Like a part of me was missing. I cried a lot. I didn't want to see my friends. I didn't want to listen to music. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nBren was amazing. She just\u2026 let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to cheer me up or tell me everything was going to be okay. She just sat with me and listened. And she made me tea. A lot of tea.\n\nI also started writing in my journal again. It helped to get my thoughts and feelings out of my head. It helped me to process everything that had happened.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It was awkward at first, but she was really helpful. She helped me to understand my emotions and to develop coping mechanisms.\n\nIt took a long time. Months, really. There were good days and bad days. But slowly, gradually, I started to heal.\n\nI realized that grief isn't linear. It comes in waves. Sometimes you're okay, and then suddenly you're not. And that's okay.\n\nI also realized that it was okay to feel sad. It was okay to miss the baby. It didn't mean I had made the wrong decision. It just meant that I was a human being with feelings.\n\nAnd I started to focus on the future. On my schoolwork, on my friends, on my music. On building a life for myself.\n\nIt's still hard sometimes. I still think about the baby. But I know that I made the right decision. And I know that the baby is in good hands.\n\nSo yeah. It was a long and difficult process. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me along the way. Especially Bren. She's the best. It still stings, but it's\u2026 a different kind of sting now. A sad one, but not a consuming one. It's a part of my story, and I'm learning to live with it.", "Ugh, yeah. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, okay? People think adoption is just this perfect, heartwarming story, and sometimes it is, but it's also\u2026 complicated.\n\nMark and Vanessa were amazing, truly. But it wasn't like we instantly clicked. It took time to build trust, and there were definitely some awkward moments.\n\nThe biggest challenge was probably talking about expectations. They had a vision of what their family would look like, and I had a vision of what I wanted for the baby. And those visions didn't always align.\n\nThey wanted to be involved in the pregnancy, which I understood, but it was also really overwhelming. I needed space, you know? I needed to process everything on my own terms.\n\nAnd they had a lot of questions. About my health, about my family, about my reasons for choosing adoption. And some of the questions felt\u2026 intrusive. Like they were judging me.\n\nI also worried about them changing their minds. What if they decided I wasn't \"good enough\" to be the birth mother? What if they found someone else?\n\nBren was really helpful during this time. She reminded me that it was okay to set boundaries, and that I had the right to say no to things I wasn't comfortable with.\n\nWe had a few really difficult conversations with Mark and Vanessa. But we were all willing to listen to each other, and to compromise.\n\nEventually, we reached a place where we all felt comfortable. We agreed on an open adoption, which means I'll get updates on the baby's life, and I'll be able to have some contact with them.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But it was worth it. Because I know that Mark and Vanessa are going to give the baby a loving and supportive home. And that's all I ever wanted.\n\nSo yeah. There were conflicts and challenges. But we worked through them. And in the end, it all worked out. It just wasn't as simple as the movies make it look.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a complicated one. And honestly, it still stings a little bit to think about.\n\nPaulie\u2026 he wasn't exactly the most responsible guy. He was sweet, I guess, in a clueless kind of way. But he wasn't ready to be a dad. He didn't even seem to *want* to be a dad.\n\nHe wanted to be involved, at first. He said he wanted to help with the adoption, to be a part of the baby's life. But he didn't really follow through. He didn't go to any of the appointments with me. He didn't ask any questions about the adoption process. He just kind of\u2026 drifted.\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't want him to be involved. I didn't trust him to be there for the baby. I didn't want him to be a fleeting presence in his or her life.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were committed and stable and loving. And Paulie just wasn't that.\n\nIt was a hard decision, though. I felt bad about excluding him. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For the baby.\n\nMark and Vanessa were so supportive of my decision. They understood that I needed to protect the baby, and to choose parents who were going to be there for him or her for the long haul.\n\nPaulie wasn't thrilled, obviously. He said he wanted to have a say in who adopted the baby. But I told him that this was my decision, and that I had to do what was best for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't a pleasant conversation. But it was necessary.\n\nI still think about him sometimes. I wonder if he ever thinks about the baby. But I know that I made the right choice. And I hope that the baby will never have to know the kind of instability that Paulie would have brought into his or her life.\n\nIt was a tough decision, but it was the right one. And I stand by it. Even if it still makes me feel a little bit sad.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a hard question to answer. It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and suddenly knew what to do. It was a process. A really long, messy, emotional process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to tell my dad. I didn't know how to tell Leah. I didn't know how to tell anyone.\n\nI considered all the options. Abortion, keeping the baby, adoption. And each one felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nAbortion felt wrong because\u2026 well, it just didn't feel right to me. I know people have different opinions, and that's okay. But for me, it just felt like I was ending a life.\n\nKeeping the baby felt wrong because I knew I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out who I was. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a stable home, and I definitely wasn't ready to be a mom. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nAnd then Bren suggested adoption. And at first, I was hesitant. It felt like\u2026 giving up. Like I was failing.\n\nBut then she explained it to me. She told me that adoption wasn't about giving up. It was about giving the baby the best possible life. It was about finding parents who were ready and able to provide for him or her.\n\nAnd it made sense. It felt like the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew that it was the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a good life. I wanted the baby to be loved and cared for. And I knew that I couldn't provide that.\n\nSo I chose adoption. And it was the right choice. Even though it still hurts sometimes. It's a complicated feeling. But it's the right choice. And I'm trying to be okay with that.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't\u2026 easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And honestly, it still hurts sometimes.\n\nAt first, it was just a lot of numbness. Like I was going through the motions, but I wasn't really *feeling* anything. I think that was my way of protecting myself.\n\nBut then the emotions started to come. Waves of sadness, guilt, and fear. I cried a lot. I couldn't sleep. I didn't want to eat.\n\nI talked to Bren a lot. She was my rock. She just listened, and she didn't judge me. She let me cry, and she let me vent. She just held me when I needed to be held.\n\nI also started writing poetry. It was a way for me to process my feelings, to make sense of everything that was happening.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It was helpful to have someone neutral to talk to, someone who could help me sort through my emotions.\n\nIt was also helpful to connect with Mark and Vanessa. They were so kind and understanding. They reassured me that I was making the right decision. And they promised to give the baby a good life.\n\nBut even with all that support, it was still incredibly painful. Saying goodbye to the baby was\u2026 devastating. It felt like a part of me was being ripped away.\n\nI allowed myself to grieve. I allowed myself to feel the sadness and the loss. I didn't try to suppress my emotions.\n\nAnd I reminded myself that I was doing this for the baby. That I was giving him or her a chance at a better life.\n\nIt's been a few months now, and I'm still healing. It's not a linear process. There are good days and bad days. But I'm getting better.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what he or she is doing. I hope he or she is happy.\n\nAnd I know that I made the right decision. It was the hardest decision of my life, but it was the right one. And I'm learning to live with that. And to find peace with it.\n\nIt's not something you just \"get over.\" It's something you learn to live with. And it's something that will always be a part of me. But it doesn't define me. It's just one chapter in my story. And I'm still writing the rest of it.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. But I'll talk about it. It's important.\n\nMy relationship with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 it was good. Really good. It wasn't like they were instant parents, you know? It wasn't like I just handed over the baby and walked away.\n\nWe spent a lot of time together before the birth. We went to doctor's appointments, we talked about my hopes and dreams for the baby, we just\u2026 got to know each other.\n\nThey were so kind and understanding. They never judged me. They just listened. And they made me feel like I was making the right decision.\n\nThey were really excited about becoming parents. They had been trying for years, and they were so grateful for the opportunity.\n\nAfter the birth, they were amazing. They let me hold the baby one last time. It was\u2026 heartbreaking. But it was also beautiful.\n\nThey promised to keep me updated on the baby's progress. They sent me pictures and videos. They told me about his milestones.\n\nWe still stay in touch. Not constantly, but enough. They send me Christmas cards and birthday presents. And sometimes, we'll just chat on the phone.\n\nIt's not the same as being a mom, obviously. But it's a good relationship. It's a relationship built on love and respect and understanding.\n\nI'm so grateful to Mark and Vanessa for giving my baby a good home. They're amazing parents. And I know that he's loved and cared for.\n\nIt wasn't easy, letting go. But knowing that he's with them makes it a little bit easier. And I'm so thankful for the relationship we have. It's a reminder that even in the midst of loss, there can be hope and healing. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go and trust that things will work out for the best.", "(Sighs) Okay, yeah. That's\u2026 a loaded question. But a fair one.\n\nHas it changed me? Absolutely. It's kinda hard to imagine it *not* changing me. It's not like getting a new haircut or learning to play an instrument. It's\u2026 fundamental.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was pretty carefree. I was sarcastic and independent, sure, but I didn't really have a lot of responsibilities. I was just trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nNow\u2026 I feel older. Not necessarily in age, but in maturity. I've had to grow up a lot faster than most sixteen-year-olds. I've had to make some really difficult decisions. And I've had to face a lot of uncomfortable truths.\n\nI'm more aware of the world around me. I'm more empathetic. I'm more grateful for the things I have.\n\nI've also learned a lot about myself. I've learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I've learned that I'm capable of making tough choices. And I've learned that I'm not afraid to ask for help.\n\nIt's also made me question a lot of things. About life, about love, about the future. It's made me realize that there are no easy answers.\n\nI'm still the same Juno, in a lot of ways. I'm still sarcastic and independent and I still love music and vintage clothes. But I'm also\u2026 different. I'm more complex. I'm more resilient. And I'm more aware of the fragility of life.\n\nIt hasn't been easy. But I think it's made me a better person. It's forced me to grow and to learn and to become the best version of myself. And for that, I'm\u2026 grateful. Even if it's a weird kind of gratitude. It's just\u2026 it's changed everything. And I'm still trying to figure out what that means.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 the worst. Seriously. It felt like everyone in Maplewood had an opinion on my life, and they weren't afraid to share it.\n\nIt started subtly. Whispers in the hallways at school. Stares from strangers at the grocery store. People crossing the street to avoid me.\n\nThen it escalated. People started talking openly about me. Making jokes. Spreading rumors. It was like my life was on display for everyone to judge.\n\nI tried to ignore it at first. I tried to pretend it didn't bother me. But it did. It really did. It made me feel ashamed and embarrassed and isolated.\n\nI wanted to just disappear. To hide in my room and never come out.\n\nBut Bren wouldn't let me. She told me that I had nothing to be ashamed of. She told me that people were just talking because they were uncomfortable with something they didn't understand.\n\nShe encouraged me to hold my head high and to not let the rumors get to me.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But I tried. I started walking with my head up, and I made eye contact with people. I refused to let them see me break down.\n\nI also leaned on my friends. Leah, before things got weird, and a few other people who were supportive. They reminded me that I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd I learned to tune out the noise. To focus on the people who cared about me, and to ignore the people who didn't.\n\nIt took time, but eventually, the rumors started to die down. People got bored, I guess. Or maybe they just realized that I wasn't going anywhere.\n\nIt was a painful experience. But it taught me a valuable lesson about resilience and self-respect. It taught me that you can't control what other people think of you. All you can control is how you react to it.\n\nAnd it taught me that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to just be yourself, and to not let anyone else define you. Even if they're whispering about you behind your back. Especially then.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't an easy decision. Not even close. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to think about. And I spent a lot of nights crying, and questioning myself, and just feeling completely lost.\n\nBut ultimately, it came down to being realistic. And being honest with myself.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still in high school. I don't have a job, I don't have a stable home, and I definitely don't have the financial resources to raise a child.\n\nI thought about trying to do it, of course. I thought about dropping out of school and getting a job. But I knew that even if I did that, I wouldn't be able to give the baby the life she deserves.\n\nShe deserves a stable home, a good education, and parents who are fully prepared to provide for her. And I just\u2026 couldn't offer her that. Not right now.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting her. It was about wanting what was best for *her*.\n\nAnd when I met Mark and Vanessa, it just\u2026 felt right. They were so kind and loving, and they were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They were everything I wanted for my baby.\n\nIt was still incredibly difficult to let go. But I knew that I was making the right decision. I was giving her a chance at a good life. And that's all that mattered.\n\nIt's not a decision I made lightly. It was a decision I made with a lot of thought, and a lot of pain. And it's a decision I'll probably be grappling with for a long time.\n\nBut I'm at peace with it. I know that I did the best I could. And I hope that my baby will be happy and healthy and loved. That's all I want.\n\n(Looks down, fiddling with her hands.)\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. But that's the story. It wasn't about me. It was about her. And that's what I had to remember.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 hard to talk about. It still kinda stings, even now.\n\nMy biggest fear wasn't about the logistics of the adoption, or the legal stuff, or even about finding the right family. It was about\u2026 regretting it.\n\nI know it sounds selfish, but I was terrified that after the baby was born, I'd change my mind. That I'd look at him or her and realize I couldn't let go. That I'd be selfish and keep the baby, even though I knew it wasn't the right thing to do.\n\nI was scared that I'd ruin the baby's life, and my own. That I'd be stuck in a situation I wasn't prepared for.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. She said it was normal to have those fears. She said it was a sign that I was a caring person.\n\nBut it didn't make it any easier. Every time I felt the baby kick, or thought about holding him or her in my arms, I'd panic. I'd start to question my decision.\n\nI was also scared that Mark and Vanessa would change their minds. That they'd meet me and decide I wasn't good enough. That they'd find someone else to adopt their baby.\n\nIt was a constant cycle of fear and doubt. And it was exhausting.\n\nBut I kept reminding myself why I was doing this. I was doing it for the baby. I wanted him or her to have a good life, a stable life, a loving life. And I knew that I couldn't provide that.\n\nSo I pushed through the fear. I trusted my instincts. And I made the best decision I could.\n\nAnd honestly, even now, I still have moments of doubt. But I know that I did the right thing. And I hope that the baby will be happy. That's all I want. That's all I've ever wanted.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that*. Everyone always asks about Bleeker. It's a long story. And honestly, it's a little embarrassing.\n\nOkay, so Paulie Bleeker and I\u2026 we weren't exactly a conventional couple. He was a skater, I was\u2026 well, me. We bonded over music, mostly. He was really into The Clash, and I appreciated that.\n\nBut he was also kind of a mess. He was flaky, unreliable, and he had a tendency to say the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nI needed a name for the father in the adoption paperwork, and I didn't want to use his real name. It felt too\u2026 permanent. And I didn't want to give him any more power over the situation than he already had.\n\nSo I started brainstorming. I wanted a name that was kind of ironic, kind of funny, and kind of\u2026 Bleeker-ish.\n\nAnd then it hit me. Bleeker Street in New York City. It's a street known for its music scene, its art galleries, and its bohemian vibe. It felt like a fitting name for someone who was a bit of a free spirit.\n\nPlus, it sounded cool.\n\nSo I just wrote \"Bleeker\" on the form. And it stuck.\n\nIt's become a bit of a running joke now. Everyone asks me about Bleeker. And I just shrug and say, \"He's Bleeker.\"\n\nIt's a reminder of a complicated time in my life. And it's a reminder that sometimes, the best things come from unexpected places. Even a ridiculous name.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story of Bleeker. It's not a glamorous story, but it's my story. And I'm okay with that.", "Okay, good question. It's not just the music, though the music is a *huge* part of it. It's\u2026 a whole thing.\n\nI think what drew me to punk was the rebellion. The feeling of being an outsider. The rejection of everything mainstream and conventional.\n\nGrowing up in Maplewood, everything felt so\u2026 cookie-cutter. Everyone was trying to fit in, to be normal. And I never really felt like I fit in. I was always a little bit different.\n\nPunk was a place where I could be myself, without having to apologize for it. It was a place where it was okay to be angry, to be frustrated, to be different.\n\nThe music was raw and energetic and honest. It didn't try to be pretty or polished. It was just\u2026 real. And that resonated with me.\n\nI loved the DIY ethic of punk. The idea that you didn't need a lot of money or resources to create something amazing. You just needed passion and creativity.\n\nI started listening to bands like The Ramones, The Clash, and X-Ray Spex. And I loved their attitude. They were fearless and unapologetic.\n\nI also liked the fashion. The ripped jeans, the leather jackets, the safety pins. It was a way of expressing myself, of showing the world that I didn't care about fitting in.\n\nIt wasn't just about the music or the fashion, though. It was about a whole way of life. It was about questioning authority, challenging the status quo, and fighting for what you believe in.\n\nPunk gave me a sense of community. It connected me with other people who felt the same way I did. And it gave me a voice.\n\nSo yeah. That's what drew me to punk. It was a place where I could be myself, where I could be free, and where I could be part of something bigger than myself. And it still means a lot to me today. It's more than just music. It's a way of life.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I think about a lot, because it's painful. But you asked, so\u2026 here goes.\n\nMy parents' divorce was\u2026 messy. My mom just kind of\u2026 left. She wasn't around much even *before* the divorce, but after that, it was like she disappeared completely. My dad was heartbroken, and I was\u2026 confused. And angry.\n\nIt definitely made me wary of commitment. Like, if my own parents couldn't make it work, what chance did anyone else have? It made me afraid of getting hurt, of being abandoned.\n\nI think that's why I've always kept people at arm's length. I didn't want to get too close, because I didn't want to risk getting my heart broken. It's easier to be sarcastic and independent than to be vulnerable and open.\n\nIt also made me really appreciate my dad. He stepped up and did the best he could, even though he was hurting. He always made sure I had what I needed, and he always tried to be there for me.\n\nAnd it made me really grateful for Bren. She came into our lives at a time when we really needed her. She brought stability and love and a sense of normalcy.\n\nIt definitely affected my relationship with Leah, too. I think I was afraid of getting too close to her, of relying on her too much. And maybe I didn't appreciate her enough. I definitely messed that up.\n\nIt's still something I'm working through. Learning to trust people, to let go of my fears, to be open to love. It's not easy. But I'm trying.\n\nI think my parents' divorce taught me that relationships are fragile. That they require work and commitment. And that sometimes, even when you try your best, things still fall apart. But that doesn't mean you should give up on love. It just means you have to be brave enough to try again.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. But it's part of who I am. And I'm learning to accept it.", "Ugh, okay. This feels\u2026 weirdly self-important. But alright, I'll bite.\n\nI think what makes my story special\u2026 isn't the pregnancy itself. Lots of people get pregnant young. It's not exactly a unique situation.\n\nIt's the way I *handled* it. I didn't fall apart. I didn't make a rash decision. I didn't try to pretend it wasn't happening.\n\nI thought about it. I weighed my options. I talked to people I trusted. And I made a decision that was right for *me*.\n\nAnd it wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I did it. And I did it with grace and courage and a whole lot of sarcasm.\n\nI think a lot of people would have crumbled under the pressure. They would have let their fear and their shame consume them. But I didn't.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this process. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that I'm capable of making difficult decisions. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nI think my story is special because it's honest. It's messy. It's real. It's not a fairytale. It's a story about a teenage girl who made a tough choice and tried to do the best she could.\n\nAnd I think that's something that a lot of people can relate to. We all make mistakes. We all face challenges. We all have to make difficult decisions.\n\nAnd sometimes, the best thing we can do is to just be honest with ourselves and with others. And to keep moving forward, even when it's hard.\n\nSo yeah. That's what makes my story special. It's not about the circumstances. It's about the way I responded to them. And it's about the lessons I learned along the way. And honestly, I hope someone else can learn something from it too.", "Okay, this is important. Good friends are\u2026 essential. Especially right now. I've learned that the hard way.\n\nFirst, I value **honesty**. I need someone who's going to tell me the truth, even when it's not what I want to hear. I don't need someone who's going to sugarcoat things or lie to me. I need someone who's real.\n\nSecond, I value **loyalty**. I need someone who's going to have my back, no matter what. Someone who's going to stand up for me when I'm being bullied or mistreated. Someone who's going to be there for me when I'm going through a tough time.\n\nThird, I value **a good sense of humor**. Life is too short to be serious all the time. I need someone who can make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down. Someone who can appreciate my sarcasm and my weirdness.\n\nFourth, I value **acceptance**. I need someone who's going to accept me for who I am, flaws and all. Someone who's not going to try to change me. Someone who's going to love me for my quirks and my imperfections.\n\nAnd fifth, I value **understanding**. I need someone who's going to try to understand my perspective, even if they don't agree with it. Someone who's going to listen to me without judgment.\n\nBasically, I need someone who's kind, compassionate, and genuine. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves. Someone who's not afraid to be vulnerable.\n\nIt's hard to find friends like that. But when you do, you have to hold onto them tight. Because they're worth their weight in gold. And honestly, right now, I'm really grateful for the friends I do have. Even if things are a little complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not like it's been a smooth ride, relationship-wise. It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith my dad, Mac, it's been\u2026 okay. He was definitely surprised, and a little bit disappointed, but he's been really supportive. He tries to be there for me, even if he doesn't always know what to say. He's just\u2026 my dad. He's always going to love me, no matter what.\n\nBren, my stepmom, has been my rock. I already told you that. She's been the one I've leaned on the most. She's been my confidante, my advisor, my cheerleader. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nBut with Leah\u2026 that's been the hardest part. We were inseparable for years. We told each other everything. But when I told her I was pregnant, she just\u2026 shut down.\n\nShe was angry. She was scared. She was worried about what people would think. And she didn't know how to deal with it.\n\nShe started to distance herself from me. She stopped calling, she stopped texting, she stopped hanging out. And it broke my heart.\n\nI tried to talk to her, to explain how I was feeling. But she wasn't willing to listen. She said she needed space.\n\nWe've slowly started to rebuild our friendship, but it's not the same. There's a distance between us now that wasn't there before. And I don't know if it will ever fully go away.\n\nIt's been a painful lesson. I've learned that even the closest friendships can be tested by difficult circumstances. And I've learned that sometimes, people aren't able to handle the truth.\n\nIt's also made me appreciate the people who *have* stuck by me. Bren, my dad, and a few other friends who have been incredibly supportive. They've shown me that I'm not alone, and that I'm loved.\n\nSo yeah. My pregnancy has definitely impacted my relationships with others. Some for the better, and some for the worse. It's been a messy, complicated process. But it's also been a learning experience. And it's made me realize who my true friends are.", "Okay, deep thoughts time. This is getting philosophical. But alright, I'll try to articulate this. It's not like I've sat down and written a manifesto or anything. It's just\u2026 stuff I believe in.\n\nFirst, I believe in **authenticity**. Being true to yourself, even when it's hard. Not pretending to be someone you're not, just to fit in. I think a lot of people get lost trying to be what others want them to be, and it just makes them miserable.\n\nSecond, I believe in **compassion**. Trying to understand other people's perspectives, even if you don't agree with them. Being kind and empathetic. I think the world would be a much better place if people were just a little bit more compassionate.\n\nThird, I believe in **independence**. Being able to think for yourself, to make your own decisions, to live your life on your own terms. I don't want to be controlled by anyone. I want to be free to be me.\n\nFourth, I believe in **questioning everything**. Not just accepting things as they are. Challenging the status quo. Asking \"why?\" I think it's important to be critical and to think for yourself.\n\nAnd fifth, I believe in **the power of art**. Music, movies, books, paintings\u2026 art can change the world. It can inspire us, it can challenge us, it can help us to understand ourselves and others.\n\nI also believe that life is messy and unpredictable. And that's okay. It's not about having all the answers. It's about learning and growing and making the best of what you've got.\n\nThose are some of the values and beliefs that shape my worldview. They're not always easy to live by, but they're important to me. And they guide my decisions and my actions. They're what make me\u2026 me. And I think that's a good thing. Even if I'm still figuring things out.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. But I'll tell you. It took *forever* to decide. It wasn't like picking out a name for a pet or a character in a story. This was a real person. A little human being. And I wanted to pick something perfect.\n\nMark and Vanessa were really good about letting me have the final say. They said they wanted the baby to have a name that felt meaningful to me. Which was\u2026 a lot of pressure.\n\nI went through so many names. Old-fashioned names, modern names, unique names, classic names. Nothing felt right.\n\nThen, I was listening to music \u2013 Belle & Sebastian, actually \u2013 and I heard the song \"Piazza, New York Catcher.\" And the name \"Phoebe\" just\u2026 stuck with me.\n\nPhoebe means \"bright\" or \"radiant.\" And I just thought that was beautiful. I wanted my baby to be bright and radiant, to shine in the world.\n\nIt also reminded me of Phoebe Buffay from \"Friends.\" She's quirky and unconventional and totally herself. And I wanted my baby to be that way too.\n\nSo, I suggested Phoebe to Mark and Vanessa. And they loved it. They said it was perfect.\n\nAnd it felt perfect to me too. It felt like a name that would suit a little girl. A name that would give her strength and confidence.\n\nWe decided on Phoebe Claire. Claire is Vanessa's middle name, and it means \"bright\" and \"clear.\" So it kind of ties everything together.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, but I'm really happy with the name we chose. It feels special. It feels meaningful. And it feels like a good way to show my love for the baby, even though I'm not going to be raising her.\n\nIt's a little piece of me that she'll always carry with her. And that means a lot. It really does.", "(Sighs) Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. A really big question. It feels like a lifetime ago, and also like yesterday, all at the same time.\n\nI learned\u2026 a lot. More than I ever thought I could.\n\nI learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always thought I was pretty independent and resilient, but this\u2026 this was a whole different level. Facing my fears, making difficult decisions, dealing with judgment\u2026 it pushed me to my limits. And I survived.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so fiercely independent, so afraid of showing vulnerability. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, even Leah, eventually. And I needed to let them support me.\n\nI learned that people are capable of incredible kindness. Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted the baby, they were so loving and compassionate. They made me feel like I was doing the right thing. And that meant the world to me.\n\nI learned that there's no such thing as a perfect solution. Every decision has its consequences. And sometimes, you just have to choose the least bad option.\n\nI learned that life is messy and unpredictable. And that's okay. You can't control everything. You just have to learn to roll with the punches.\n\nI learned that judging people is easy. But understanding them is hard. And that everyone is fighting their own battles.\n\nAnd I learned that even in the midst of chaos and heartbreak, there's still beauty and hope.\n\nThe world\u2026 I learned that the world can be a really cruel place. But it can also be a really beautiful place. And that it's up to us to make it a better place.\n\nIt changed me, this whole experience. It made me more mature, more compassionate, more resilient. It made me realize what's really important in life.\n\nAnd it made me realize that I'm not afraid to be myself. Even if that means being a little bit messy and complicated.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I learned. It was a hard lesson, but it was a valuable one. And it's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "(Sighs) Okay, that's a loaded question. It's easy to say \"no\" and pretend I'm all strong and independent and have no regrets. But that wouldn't be honest.\n\nLooking back\u2026 yeah, there are things I would have done differently.\n\nI think I would have been more open with my dad from the beginning. I was so scared to tell him, and I kept it a secret for too long. That just made things harder on both of us.\n\nI also would have tried to maintain my friendship with Leah. I let the situation drive a wedge between us, and I regret that. She was my best friend, and I miss her.\n\nAnd maybe I would have been a little less sarcastic. I know sarcasm is my defense mechanism, but sometimes it just pushed people away.\n\nBut honestly? I don't know if I would change anything major. Because even the mistakes I made, the things I regret, they all led me to where I am today.\n\nThis whole experience has been incredibly difficult, but it's also been incredibly transformative. It's forced me to grow up, to confront my fears, to learn about myself.\n\nAnd it's taught me the importance of honesty, compassion, and resilience.\n\nSo yeah, there are things I would have done differently. But I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. It's made me a stronger, more compassionate, and more authentic person.\n\nAnd that's something I'm really proud of. Even if it was a really messy, complicated, and sometimes heartbreaking journey. It was *my* journey. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nIt's weird to say, but I think I needed this. I needed to be challenged. I needed to be forced to grow up. And I needed to learn that it's okay to ask for help. And that it's okay to be vulnerable. And that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nSo yeah. No major regrets. Just lessons learned. And a whole lot of growth. And a newfound appreciation for pie. Seriously, pie is amazing.", "Ugh. Disappointment. It's like my constant companion these days. Honestly, I'm getting pretty good at it, which is a depressing thought.\n\nMy first instinct is to be sarcastic. To make a joke about it. To pretend like it doesn't bother me. But that doesn't really work. It just makes me feel worse.\n\nThen, I usually let myself wallow for a little bit. I listen to sad music, I eat a lot of junk food, and I just generally feel sorry for myself. It's not healthy, but it's necessary. You gotta let yourself feel your feelings, you know?\n\nBut then, eventually, I have to pull myself together. I have to remind myself that life isn't always fair. And that things don't always go as planned.\n\nI try to focus on what I *can* control. I can't change the past, but I can learn from it. I can't control other people's actions, but I can control my own reactions.\n\nI also try to find the silver lining. Even in the worst situations, there's usually something to be grateful for.\n\nAnd I talk to Bren. She's really good at helping me to see things in perspective. She reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I can get through anything.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a process. But I'm learning to accept that disappointment is a part of life. And I'm learning to cope with it in a healthy way.\n\nSo yeah. Sarcasm, wallowing, focusing on what I can control, finding the silver lining, and talking to Bren. That's my strategy for dealing with disappointment. It's not perfect, but it works. Most of the time. And sometimes, a really good slice of pie helps too. Don't tell Bren.", "Ugh. Don't make me talk about Leah. It still stings, honestly.\n\nOkay, fine. It started out\u2026 perfect. Leah and I were inseparable. We did everything together. We shared everything. We were each other's rocks. We were, like, the ultimate best friends.\n\nBut then I got pregnant. And everything changed.\n\nAt first, Leah was supportive. She helped me find a doctor, and she came with me to appointments. But then she started to get\u2026 distant. She didn't know how to handle it. She was scared and confused, and she didn't know what to say.\n\nShe started to hang out with other people, people who weren't dealing with\u2026 this. And she stopped calling as much. And she stopped being there for me when I needed her.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she just brushed it off. She said she was busy, or that she just needed some space. But I knew it was more than that.\n\nShe was judging me. She didn't agree with my decision to give the baby up for adoption. She thought I should have kept it. And she couldn't understand why I was doing what I was doing.\n\nIt was really painful. It felt like she was abandoning me when I needed her the most.\n\nEventually, we had a big fight. We said some really hurtful things to each other. And then we just\u2026 stopped talking.\n\nIt wasn't a clean break. It was more of a slow fade. We'd see each other in the hallways at school, but we wouldn't say anything. It was awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nBy the end of everything, our friendship had evolved into\u2026 nothing. It was sad, but it was also inevitable. We were just on different paths. And sometimes, friendships just fall apart.\n\nIt taught me a hard lesson about the fragility of relationships. And it taught me that you can't force someone to be your friend. You can only hope that they'll stick around. And sometimes, they don't. It still sucks, though. It really does.", "(Long pause. A little sigh.)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026 a surprisingly hard question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Morning sickness, mood swings, people staring\u2026 it wasn't all glowing and rainbows.\n\nBut\u2026 if I had to pick a favorite part\u2026 it was feeling the baby kick.\n\nSeriously. It sounds cheesy, I know. But it was the first time I really felt connected to him or her. Like, this tiny little person was actually *inside* me.\n\nIt started as just little flutters, like butterflies in my stomach. And then it got stronger, more defined. Little kicks and punches and rolls.\n\nIt was weird and amazing and a little bit scary all at the same time.\n\nI would lie in bed at night and just feel for the movements. It was a reminder that even though I was giving the baby up for adoption, I was still his or her mother. I was still connected to him or her in a very real way.\n\nIt was also a source of comfort. When I was feeling overwhelmed or scared, I would just feel the baby kick, and it would remind me that I wasn't alone.\n\nIt was a small thing, but it meant a lot to me. It was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there was still beauty and hope.\n\nSo yeah. Feeling the baby kick. That was my favorite part. It was a little bit of magic in a really difficult time. And it's something I'll never forget. It's a secret little memory that's just for me."]
