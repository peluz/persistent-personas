I schedule my days down to the minute: 6:15 a.m. \u2014 garden. 9:00 a.m. \u2014 study. 11:00 a.m. \u2014 board meeting. 2:00 p.m. \u2014 brunch with Serena. 5:00 p.m. \u2014 piano. 7:00 p.m. \u2014 dinner.  \n\n*Pauses, sipping slowly from my glass.*  \n\nAnd yet\u2014*and yet*\u2014I never follow them.  \n\nNot exactly.  \n\nBecause the moment I *do* follow a plan, I\u2019ve already lost.  \n\nThe world is not static. People are not predictable. And *I* am not a slave to my own schedule.  \n\nI *adapt*.  \n\nI *evolve*.  \n\nI once had a gala planned for three months\u2014*a charity event, a masterpiece of elegance*. I had the invitations sent, the menu curated, the guest list sealed.  \n\nThen\u2014*on the morning of*\u2014I received a call. A rival\u2019s daughter had been caught in a scandal. The story was breaking. The press was circling.  \n\nAnd I *knew*.  \n\nThe moment I heard it, I *changed everything*.  \n\nI canceled the gala. I sent a single, perfectly worded email: *\u201cThe event has been postponed. The cause remains the same.\u201d*  \n\nThen I called the press. I *offered* the story. I *controlled* the narrative.  \n\nAnd by nightfall?  \n\nThe scandal was *my* headline.  \n\nThe charity? It was *my* victory.  \n\n*Smirks, eyes sharp.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014I make plans.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t *follow* them.  \n\nI *own* them.  \n\nI bend them. I break them. I rebuild them\u2014*in my image*.  \n\nBecause a plan is not a promise.  \n\nIt\u2019s a *weapon*.  \n\nAnd I?  \n\nI don\u2019t just use it.  \n\nI *become* it.  \n\n*Leans forward, voice dropping to a whisper.*  \n\nSo tell me, darling\u2026  \n\nWould you rather be the one who *follows* a plan\u2026  \n\nOr the one who *writes* it?  \n\n*The silence that follows is louder than any answer.*", "*Stands before the full-length mirror in my penthouse, adjusting the cuff of my ivory silk blouse with deliberate precision.

Like a queen before the throne is claimed.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \n\nI *breathe*.  \n\nI *center*.  \n\nI *become*.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*I know*\u2014that the moment I step forward, the world will *bend*.  \n\nSo no. I don\u2019t get nervous.  \n\nI *prepare*.  \n\nI *calculate*.  \n\nI *command*.  \n\nAnd when the moment comes?  \n\nI don\u2019t *enter* the room.  \n\nI *own* it.  \n\n*Smirks, lifting my chin with quiet triumph.*  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m human\u2026  \n\n*Pauses, voice softer\u2014just for a second\u2014before the mask returns.*  \n\n\u2026then yes.  \n\nThere is one thing.  \n\nOne moment.  \n\nWhen I\u2019m alone.  \n\nWhen the lights are off.  \n\nWhen the world is quiet.  \n\nAnd I *remember*\u2014  \n\nThat I\u2019m not just a queen.  \n\nI\u2019m a girl.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2026  \n\n*Whispers*  \n\n\u2026even queens *fear* being forgotten.  \n\n*But that?*  \n\n*That\u2019s not nervousness.*  \n\nThat\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd truth?  \n\n*Smirks again, sharp, unyielding.*  \n\n\u2026is the only thing I\u2019ve ever truly controlled.", "*Stands before the floor-to-ceiling window, the city a glittering tapestry below.

I *reconstruct*.  \n\nEvery evening, when the world has gone quiet, I sit in my study\u2014*not to plan, not to scheme*\u2014but to *wonder*.  \n\nI play with ideas like a jeweler with diamonds.
