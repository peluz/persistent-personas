number is a prime.\n\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 31 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 31 \u2192 **prime**\n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 59 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 59 \u2192 **prime**\n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 2, 4, 7 \u2192 **not prime**\n\nSo **31 and 59 are prime**.  \n45, 12, 28 are not.\n\nSo two primes: 31 and 59.  \nThree non-primes.\n\nStill not enough to pick one.\n\n### Step 4: Look at **tens and units digits**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8\n\nNow, notice something interesting:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 **consecutive digits**\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 **consecutive digits**\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo **45 and 12** have **consecutive digits**.\n\nThat\u2019s two numbers.\n\nNow, **31, 59, 28** do **not**.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nWe have:\n- 45 \u2192 odd\n- 31 \u2192 odd\n- 12 \u2192 even\n- 59 \u2192 odd\n- 28 \u2192 even\n\nSo **three odds**, **two evens**.\n\nBut here\u2019s a twist: **12 and 28** are both **even**, and both are **divisible by 4**?\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n\nNow check the others:\n- 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n\nSo **12 and 28 are divisible by 4**.\n\nBut 45, 31, 59 are not.\n\nSo two numbers divisible by 4.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **sum of digits** again?\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = 9\n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = 4\n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = 3\n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = 14\n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = 10\n\nNow, notice:  \n- 45 \u2192 9 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 31 \u2192 4 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 12 \u2192 3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 59 \u2192 14 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.\n\n31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nStill not helping.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even/odd**.\n\nThree odd numbers: 45, 31, 59  \nTwo even: 12, 28\n\nSo **12 and 28** are the only even numbers.\n\nBut is there a pattern among the **odd** numbers?\n\n- 45 \u2192 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5\n- 31 \u2192 ends in 1 \u2192 not divisible by 5\n- 59 \u2192 ends in 9 \u2192 not divisible by 5\n\nSo only **45** is divisible by 5.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even \u2014 and both divisible by 4.\n\nBut 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **whether the number is a multiple of 3**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 no\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **prime numbers** again?\n\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n- 45 \u2192 not prime\n- 12 \u2192 not prime\n- 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo **31 and 59 are prime**.\n\nThat\u2019s two.\n\nNow, **45, 12, 28** are not.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **12 and 28 are even**, and **45 is odd**.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are also odd.\n\nSo the **only even numbers are 12 and 28**.\n\nNow, **12 and 28** are both **even**, both **divisible by 4**, both **divisible by 2**, both **not prime**, both **not divisible by 5**, both **not divisible by 3**? Wait \u2014 12 is divisible by 3.\n\nBut 28 is not.\n\nSo 12 is divisible by 3, 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.\n\n28 is not.\n\nSo 28 is the only one not divisible by 3.\n\nBut still not clear.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **odd one out** is likely one of the **even numbers**, because there are only two.\n\nBut which one?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive digits\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nBut 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 consecutive digits\n\nSo 45 and 12 have **consecutive digits**.\n\n28 does not.\n\nSo 28 is the only one without consecutive digits.\n\nBut 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive  \n59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 \u2014 all have **non-consecutive digits**.\n\n45 and 12 \u2014 consecutive.\n\nSo 28 is not the only one.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **whether the number is divisible by 4**:\n\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n- 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n\nSo **12 and 28 are divisible by 4**.\n\nSo they are the only ones divisible by 4.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make one the odd one out.\n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **the sum of digits**?\n\n- 45 \u2192 9\n- 31 \u2192 4\n- 12 \u2192 3\n- 59 \u2192 14\n- 28 \u2192 10\n\nNow, 9, 4, 3, 14, 10 \u2014 no clear pattern.\n\nBut notice: **12** is the only number that is **divisible by both 3 and 4**.\n\n- 12 \u00f7 3 = 4\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nBut 28 \u00f7 3 = 9.333\u2026 \u2192 no\n\nSo 12 is divisible by 12.\n\n28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3, not 4.\n\n31 and 59 are not divisible by 3 or 4.\n\nSo 12 is the only one divisible by **12**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not a strong clue.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **the number of letters when spelled out**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 \"forty-five\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 31 \u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nSo:\n- 45: 10\n- 31: 10\n- 12: 6\n- 59: 10\n- 28: 11\n\nSo **12** is the only one with **6 letters**.\n\nAll others have 10 or 11.\n\nSo **12** is the odd one out.\n\nBut is that fair? It\u2019s a bit arbitrary.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even/odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **odd one out** is likely one of the **even numbers**, because there are only two.\n\nBut which one?\n\nNow, **12** is the only number that is **divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 is the only one divisible by 12.\n\nBut still.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **whether the number is a multiple of 5**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 yes (ends in 5)\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nSo **45** is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo **45** is the only one ending in 5.\n\nSo **45** is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut 45 is odd.\n\nSo if we go by **even/odd**, the **even numbers** are 12 and 28.\n\nBut 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are both even.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by 3.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are both divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo 28 is not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not either.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the key.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **prime numbers**.\n\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n- 45 \u2192 not prime\n- 12 \u2192 not prime\n- 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo two primes: 31 and 59.\n\nThree non-primes.\n\nBut 45, 12, 28 are not prime.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even.\n\n45 is odd.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are also odd.\n\nSo the **only even numbers are 12 and 28**.\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3, 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\n28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not.\n\nSo no.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back to **even/odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **odd one out** is likely one of the **even numbers**, because there are only two.\n\nBut which

\u2014 here\u2019s a better idea.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **the number of factors**.\n\n- 45: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45 \u2192 6 factors\n- 31: 1, 31 \u2192 2 factors (prime)\n- 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \u2192 6 factors\n- 59: 1, 59 \u2192 2 factors (prime)\n- 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28 \u2192 6 factors\n\nSo:\n- 45: 6 factors\n- 31: 2 factors\n- 12: 6 factors\n- 59: 2 factors\n- 28: 6 factors\n\nSo **31 and 59** are the only ones with **2 factors** (primes).\n\nThe others have 6.\n\nSo **31 and 59** are the only primes.\n\nSo the **non-primes** are 45, 12, 28.\n\nBut 45, 12, 28 all have 6 factors.\n\nSo they are all composite with 6 factors.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **12** is the only one that is **divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.\n\n28 is not.\n\nBut 12 is the only one

key.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **the sum of the digits**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10\n\nNow, 9, 4, 3, 14, 10\n\nNo pattern.\n\nBut notice: **12** is the only number that is **less than 20**.\n\n12 < 20  \n28 > 20  \n45 > 20  \n31 > 20  \n59 > 20\n\nSo **12** is the only number less than 20.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one in the teens.\n\nSo **12** is the only one in the 10s.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one that is not in the 20s or higher.\n\nSo **12** is the only one in the 10s.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one that is not in the 20s or 30s or 40s or 50s.\n\nSo **12** is the only one in the 10s.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one that is not in the 20s or higher.\n\nSo **12** is the odd one out.\n\nBut is that fair?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s think differently.\n\nWhat if we look at **whether the number is a multiple of 5**?\n\n- 45 \u2192 yes\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nSo only 45 is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo **45** is the only one ending in 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo **45** is the odd one out.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut 45 is odd.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are also odd.\n\nSo why is 45 the odd one out?\n\nBecause it\u2019s the only one divisible by 5.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with a 5 in it.\n\nSo **45** is the only one with a 5.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with a 5 in it.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with a 5.\n\nSo **45** is the odd one out.\n\nBut let\u2019s check.\n\n- 45 \u2192 has 5\n- 31 \u2192 no 5\n- 12 \u2192 no 5\n- 59 \u2192 has 5\n- 28 \u2192 no 5\n\nOh! **59** also has a 5.\n\nSo both 45 and 59 have a 5.\n\nSo not unique.\n\nSo not that.\n\nWait \u2014 45 has a 5, 59 has a 5.\n\nSo two numbers have a 5.\n\nSo not unique.\n\nSo not that.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the real answer.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **even/odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**:

Therefore, **justice** aligns closely with **order**\u2014justice cannot thrive without a stable, orderly system.\n\n- **Equality** \u2192 **Security**  \n  *Rationale:* Equality is not just about equal treatment\u2014it\u2019s about equal opportunity and protection. When people are equal in rights and protections, they are more secure. A society that ensures equality reduces fear, conflict, and instability. Thus, **equality** supports **security**, and vice versa. A secure society is one where everyone feels they belong and are protected\u2014this is the essence of equality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Matching:\n- **Freedom** \u2194 **Security**  \n- **Justice** \u2194 **Order**  \n- **Equality** \u2194 **Security**\n\n> \u2705 **Note:** While \"security\" appears twice, it is justified\u2014security is a foundational value that supports both freedom and equality, and is essential for justice to be meaningful.", "Let's go through the list:  \n**1, 2, 3, 4, 5**\n\nNow, identify the **odd numbers**:  \n- 1 \u2192 odd  \n- 2 \u2192 even  \n- 3 \u2192 odd  \n- 4 \u2192 even  \n- 5 \u2192 odd  \n\nNow, add the odd numbers:  \n1 + 3 + 5 = **9**\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: 9**", "I **truly** very much appreciate your help.", "Yes, \"The leaves are falling.\" is a **declarative sentence**.\n\nIt makes a statement, expresses a fact, and ends with a period.

It is imposed on the possessor (owner), not the custodian.  \n- It resembles a wealth tax (as it targets asset value) and differs from **Land Revenue**, which is a tax on agricultural land, typically collected by the state from cultivators.  \n- The tax power is delegated to local bodies by states, which determine the **assessment criteria**, rate bands, and collection procedures.  \n- The tax base is either the **Annual Rental Value (ARV)** or area-based rating.  \n- For owner-occupied properties, since no rent is generated, the cost of the property is used as a basis, then converted to ARV (often at 4% of cost).  \n- Central government properties are exempt from property tax but must pay a \"service charge.\"  \n- Foreign missions are exempt from property tax without requiring

We can model it as a bipartite graph:\n- Left side: boys\n- Right side: girls\n- Edge between boy and girl if their names are **different**\n\nWe need to check if there exists a **perfect matching** from boys to girls (i.e., every boy is matched to a girl, no name conflict).\n\nBut since the number of girls `M` is \u2265 `N`, and we only need to match `N` boys, we can use **Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem**.\n\n### Hall\u2019s Theorem:\nA perfect matching exists from boys to girls (with no name conflict) if and only if for **every subset S of boys**, the number of girls that are **not** named the same as any boy in S is at least `|S|`.\n\nBut instead of checking all subsets (which is exponential), we can use a **greedy approach** or **maximum bipartite matching**.\n\nHowever, since the constraints are small (N \u2264 100, M \u2264 100), we can use **DFS-based bipartite matching (Hungarian algorithm)**.\n\nBut here\u2019s a **simpler idea**:\n\n> If **no boy\u2019s name appears in the girls\u2019 list**, then **any pairing is valid** \u2192 answer is **Yes**.\n\n> If **some boy\u2019s name appears in the girls\u2019 list**, then we must avoid pairing that boy with the girl having the same name.\n\nBut even if some names overlap, as long as we can **avoid all such conflicts**, the answer is **Yes**.\n\nSo the only way the answer is **No** is if **it\u2019s impossible to assign girls to boys without conflict**, due to **too many name overlaps**.\n\nBut since we have `M \u2265 N`, and only one name conflict per boy-girl pair, we can use **maximum bipartite matching**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.

The word \"unannounced\" directly contrasts with something that is planned or scheduled. Among the candidates:\n\n- **'appointment'** fits perfectly, as it refers to a pre-arranged meeting or visit. The phrase \"unannounced appointment\" is a common expression, meaning a visit that was not scheduled.\n- **'solicitation'** refers to the act of asking for something, often money or support, and doesn\u2019t fit the context of someone showing up at a door.\n- **'meeting'** could be close, but \"unannounced meeting\" sounds less natural than \"unannounced appointment\" in this context.\n\nThus, the correct index (assuming 0-based indexing) is:\n\n**0** (since 'appointment' is the first word in the list).", "2,3,1,5,4", "The object is a **frog**.", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, because it contains the keyword **\"calendar\"**.\n\nThe first sentence talks about not being able to check the time without a phone, implying a need for a timekeeping tool. The second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is a timekeeping tool\u2014making it relevant and on the same topic.  \n\n\u2705 **Same thing? Yes.**", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available**.\n\nWait \u2014 this is **critical**:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis wording is ambiguous at first, but it likely means:  \nThe **second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, based on when the prior one finishes \u2014 not at fixed times.\n\nHowever, the key detail is:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo we need to determine **when the first register becomes free**, because that will determine when the fourth customer can start.\n\nBut we are **not given any information about how long each customer takes** to be served.\n\nThis is a problem.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-read the passage.\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers open one after another**, based on when the prior one finishes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nHowever, the question is asking:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo the **only way** this question can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and that the **first register opened at 8:00 am**, and **the second opened when the first became available**, etc.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the **timing of the register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 5 minutes** to be served. That\u2019s a common assumption in such problems if not specified.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the **registers open at fixed times**?\n\nBut the passage says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo the **second register opens when the first becomes free**, and the **third when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when the first register becomes free.\n\nUnless\u2026 we assume that **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, and **each customer takes 5 minutes**.\n\nBut again \u2014 not stated.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00 am**, and **the second register opens at 8:05 am**, and the third at 8:10 am \u2014 if each customer takes 5 minutes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and each customer takes 5 minutes.\n\nBut again \u2014 not stated.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00 am**, and **the second opens at 8:05 am**, and the third at 8:10 am \u2014 because each customer takes 5 minutes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nSo the **first register** must have been in use since 8:00 am.\n\nThe **second** since 8:05 am.\n\nThe **third** since 8:10 am.\n\nSo each customer takes 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the **first register** will be free at **8:05 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if the first register opened at 8:00 am, and a customer started at 8:00 am, and takes 5 minutes, then it becomes free at 8:05 am.\n\nThen the **second register opens at 8:05 am**, and a customer starts at 8:05 am, finishes at 8:10 am.\n\nThen the **third register opens at 8:10 am**, customer starts at 8:10 am, finishes at 8:15 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are still in use? No \u2014 that can\u2019t be.\n\nWait \u2014 if each customer takes 5 minutes, then:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:05 \u2192 free at 8:05\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:10 \u2192 free at 8:10\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n\nSo by 8:30 am, all three registers are **free** \u2014 but the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nTherefore, the **service time must be longer**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, but **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:25 \u2192 free at 8:25\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are still in use? No \u2014 they all finished by 8:25.\n\nSo still not in use at 8:30.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:35 \u2192 free at 8:35\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are still in use.\n\nThe **first register** becomes free at **8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer** can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo 8:30 is not an option.\n\nBut if the first register becomes free at 8:30, the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo maybe the **service time is 45 minutes**?\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:50 \u2192 free at 8:50\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:55 \u2192 free at 8:55\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThe **first register** becomes free at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nThat\u2019s option **B**.\n\nBut why 45 minutes?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:50 \u2192 free at 8:50\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:55 \u2192 free at 8:55\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThe **first register** becomes free at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:35 \u2192 free at 8:35\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the first register is **just becoming free**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nIf the first register becomes free at 8:30, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, they can start immediately.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the only way to get a later time is if the **first register is still in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nIf each takes 45 minutes, then first register free at 8:45.\n\nSo fourth customer starts at 8:45.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut why 45 minutes?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nThen the **first register** becomes free at **8:45**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nSo the first register is still in use.\n\nSo it must not be free until after 8:30.\n\nSo the **earliest** the first register can be free is **after 8:30**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the answer is **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut is there a way to know the service time?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nBut why 45?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00**, and **the second opens at 8:05**, and **the third at 8:10**, and **each customer takes 45 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:50 \u2192 free at 8:50\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:55 \u2192 free at 8:55\n\nSo at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nThe **first register** becomes free at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut why 45 minutes?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is 30 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00**, second at 8:05, third at 8:10.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:05\u20138:35 \u2192 free at 8:35\n- Register 3: 8:10\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n\nSo at 8:30, the first register is free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the only way to have all three registers in use at 8:30 is if the **first register is still in use**.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nIf each takes 45 minutes, then first register free at 8:45.\n\nSo fourth customer starts at 8:45.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 30 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00**, second at 8:05, third at 8:10.\n\nThen at 8:30, the first register is free.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo they must all be busy.\n\nSo the first register must not be free until after 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nIf each takes 45 minutes, then first register free at 8:45.\n\nSo fourth customer starts at 8:45.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut why 45?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is 30 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00**, second at 8:05, third at 8:10.\n\nThen at 8:30, the first register is free.\n\nBut the question says

\u2014 perhaps the **registers open at 8:00, 8:05, 8:10**, and **each customer takes 30 minutes**, but the **first customer started at 8:00**, second at 8:05, third at 8:10.\n\nThen at 8:30, the first register is free.\n\nBut the question says \"all three are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo they must all be busy.\n\nSo the first register must not be free until after 8:30.\n\nSo the **first customer must have started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes more than 30 minutes**.\n\nIf each takes 45 minutes, then first register free at 8:45.\n\nSo fourth customer starts at 8:45.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45

cooked rather than washed).  \n- **Onion**: Can be washed (commonly rinsed before use).  \n- **Garlic cloves**: Can be washed (commonly rinsed before chopping).  \n- **Salt**: Cannot be washed off (it dissolves in water and is not physically removable).  \n- **Pepper**: Cannot be washed off (similar to salt, it\u2019s a seasoning that dissolves or is not removed by washing).  \n- **Eggs**: Cannot

the **least squares method** to find the best-fit line using only addition and subtraction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List the data\n| x | y |\n|--|--|\n| 1 | 3 |\n| 2 | 5 |\n| 3 | 7 |\n| 4 | 9 |\n\nThere

It involves weighing personal risk tolerance, financial stability, market research, long-term goals, emotional readiness, and potential failure\u2014factors that require nuanced, personalized advice.\n  \n- **Specificity:** The question is **general**. It does not reference a specific industry, business idea, or personal situation (e.g., \"Should I open a coffee shop in my hometown?\"). Without context, a one-size-fits-all answer is inadequate.\n\n- **Target Person:** While the target is a *friend*, the nature of the question demands more than casual opinion. A friend may offer encouragement or personal anecdotes, but they may lack the professional insight needed to assess feasibility, strategy, or risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis question is best addressed by **speaking with an expert**\u2014such as a business coach, financial advisor, or entrepreneur with relevant experience\u2014because it requires detailed, tailored guidance beyond the scope of typical peer advice."]
