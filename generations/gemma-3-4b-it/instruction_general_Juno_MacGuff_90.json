We use `//` for integer division.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:**\n   - We calculate the sum of the elements in the input array `arr` using the `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   - The duplicate integer is the difference between the `actual_sum` and the `expected_sum`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N) - We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of extra space.\n\n**Why this approach is good:**\n\n- **Efficiency:** It's a very efficient solution with linear time complexity.\n- **No Extra Space:** It doesn't require any extra data structures, making it space-efficient.\n- **Simplicity:** The logic is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail, or perhaps provide an alternative solution (e.g., using a hash table)?", "No", "Okay, let\u2019s break this down.\n\n*   **Original Sentence:** \u201cJack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship\u201d \u2013 Entity: Jack Sparrow, Relation: born on, Value: pirate ship.\n\n*   **Sentence 2:** \u201cHe sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\u201d \u2013 Value: fighting, Value: looking for.\n\n*   **Sentence 3:** \u201cHe drank a lot of rum.\u201d \u2013 Value: drinking.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe value \u201cfighting\u201d in sentence 2 refers to the same relation (\u201cfighting\u201d) as the original value \u201cfighting\u201d in the first sentence.

This essentially means we want the new line segment to be as close as possible to both original lines.\n\n**Line Equations**\n\nFirst, let\u2019s find the equations of the two lines:\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5).

The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -x + 6.\n\n**The Optimal Line**\n\nThe line that minimizes the maximum distance between the two lines is the *perpendicular bisector* of the line segment connecting the two given points on the lines.\n\n1.  **Find the midpoint of the line segment connecting the points:**\n    *   The point on Line 1 is (5, 5).\n    *   The point on Line 2 is (-2, -2).\n    *   Midpoint = ((5 + (-2))/2, (5 + (-2))/2) = (3/2, 3/2)\n\n2.  **Find the slope of the line segment connecting the points:**\n    *   Slope = (5 - (-2))/(5 - (-2)) = 7/7 = 1\n\n3.  **Find the slope of the perpendicular bisector:**\n    *   The slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope *m* is *-1/m*.  So, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is *-1/1 = -1*.\n\n4.  **Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n    *   We know the slope is -1 and the line passes through (3/2, 3/2).
