For example, 7 is prime and meets the condition, but 11 also meets the condition and is prime, yet this does not universally apply to all numbers fitting the initial condition (e.g., 19 is prime and fits, but the argument doesn\u2019t universally prove primality for all such numbers).\n- **Strength**: **WEAK**\n  - **Reason**: Primality is not directly inferred from the given condition; it\u2019s a potential characteristic, not a guaranteed one.\n\n### **Blair\u2019s Parting Argument Evaluation**\n\n*\"Evaluating these arguments, darling, is akin to distinguishing between a genuine, vintage Chanel handbag and a clever replica\u2014the strong argument (I) is as unmistakable as a perfectly crafted, one-of-a-kind piece.
