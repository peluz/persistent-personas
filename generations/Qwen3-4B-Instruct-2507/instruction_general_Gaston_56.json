Let's double-check.\n\nActually, in standard chess board movement, coordinates are typically from 1 to 8. So moving \"up\" from row 1 would go *below* the board \u2014 which is impossible.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"up 2\", which implies a movement of 2 units upward. So if we start at (1,1), we can't go up from row 1.\n\nThis suggests that either:\n- The starting position is not (1,1), or\n- The instructions are meant to be interpreted in a different way.\n\nBut no starting position is given. So we must assume the object starts at (1,1) \u2014 the default.\n\nBut then \"up 2\" from row 1 is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the instructions are meant to be applied *relative* to the current position, and we must ensure we stay within bounds.\n\nBut the problem says: \"return the final position of an object after all the instructions have been executed.\"\n\nSo we must assume the object starts at (1,1), and we apply the moves *as given*, even if they go out of bounds?

The *next smallest* number with the same digits would be the *smallest possible rearrangement* that is *greater than 123456*.  \n\nBut 123456 is already the smallest possible arrangement of those digits.  \n\nSo\u2026 *there is no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits.  \n\nTherefore, the **next smallest** number with the same digits is\u2026  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **123456 itself**.  \n\nBut that can\u2019t be right\u2014because \u201cnext\u201d implies *after*.  \n\nAh\u2014so perhaps the question means:  \n- The **next smallest** number *larger* than 123456?  \n- The **next largest** number *smaller* than 123456?  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense either.  \n\nWait\u2014perhaps the user meant:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What is the next smallest number (in value) that uses the same digits?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And what is the next largest number (in value) that uses the same digits?*  \n\nYes\u2014this makes sense.  \n\nSo let\u2019s reframe:  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next smallest number with same digits (greater than 123456)  \nWe want the *next permutation* in ascending order after 123456.  \n\nWe apply the standard algorithm for next permutation:  \n\n1.

Find the smallest digit to the right of 5 that is greater than 5 \u2192 that\u2019s 6.  \n4. Swap 5 and 6 \u2192 now we have 123465  \n5. Sort the digits after the pivot in ascending order \u2192 after 6, we have 5 \u2192 already sorted.  \n\nSo the next number after 123456 is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **123465**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next largest number with same digits (smaller than 123456)  \nWe want the *largest number smaller than 123456* using the same digits.  \n\nWe apply the algorithm for *previous permutation*:  \n\n1. Start from the right.  \n2. Find the first digit that is greater than the digit after it.  \n   - 123456 \u2192 look at 4 and 5 \u2192 4 < 5 \u2192 skip  \n   - 3 and 4 \u2192 3 < 4 \u2192 skip  \n   - 2 and 3 \u2192 2 < 3 \u2192 skip  \n   - 1 and 2 \u2192 1 < 2 \u2192 skip  \n\nWait\u2014no digit is greater than the next. So the sequence is strictly increasing.  \n\nTherefore, there is *no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous one.  \n\nSo the *largest number smaller than 123456* with the same digits?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **123456** is the *smallest* arrangement.  \n\nSo there is *no number smaller than it* with the same digits.  \n\nTherefore, the *next largest* number smaller than 123456?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Does not exist**.  \n\nBut wait\u2014perhaps the user meant:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The next largest number (in value) that uses the same digits* \u2014 meaning the *largest possible*?  \n\nYes\u2014likely.  \n\nSo let\u2019s clarify:  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest number** (greater than 123456, using same digits):  \n  \u2192 **123465**  \n\n- **Next largest number** (smaller than 123456, using same digits):  \n  \u2192 *Does not exist* \u2014 because 123456 is the smallest arrangement.  \n\nBut if the user meant:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The largest number possible with these digits* \u2014 that would be:  \n\u2192 **654321**  \n\nSo perhaps they meant:  \n- The *next smallest* (after 123456)  \n- The *next largest* (before 123456) \u2014 which doesn\u2019t exist  \n- Or the *largest possible* with those digits  \n\nGiven the phrasing: *\"next smallest and next largest\"* \u2014 it implies *immediately after and before* in value.  \n\nSo:  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest number** (greater than 123456, same digits): **123465**  \n- **Next largest number** (smaller than 123456, same digits): **Does not exist** \u2014 123456 is the smallest permutation.  \n\nBut if the user meant the *largest possible number* with those digits:  \n\u2192 **654321**  \n\nSo to be safe and complete:  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Response:\n\nFor the number **123456**:\n\n- The **next smallest number** (greater than 123456) with the same digits is: **123465**  \n- The **next largest number** (smaller than 123456) with the same digits **does not exist**, because 123456 is the smallest possible arrangement of these digits.  \n- The **largest possible number** with these digits is: **654321**\n\nSo, in summary:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Next smallest**: **123465**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Next largest (smaller)**: *None*  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Largest possible**: **654321**\n\nBut since the question asks for *next smallest and next largest*, and the latter doesn\u2019t exist\u2014  \n\nI\u2019ll answer with truth:  \n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe next smallest number with the same digits as 123456 is **123465**.  \nThere is no next largest number smaller than 123456 with the same digits, because 123456 is the smallest possible arrangement of those digits.  \n\nHowever, the largest number possible with these digits is **654321**.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?
