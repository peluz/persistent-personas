I'm not saying they look bad! I'm just saying, \"Hey, maybe you want to consider coordinating your colors a little better.\" It's constructive criticism!\n\nAnd sometimes people just\u2026 need a little nudge in the right direction.

It's all about helping people reach their full potential!\n\n(Pauses, then adds sheepishly)\n\nOkay, maybe I sometimes focus on the negative. But it's only because I'm a perfectionist!

A gift of\u2026 creative chaos!\n\nOkay, okay, let's be honest. I am *extremely* disorganized. My desk is a disaster zone. It's like a paper avalanche waiting to happen. There are files everywhere, half-eaten snacks, random office supplies\u2026 it's a beautiful mess!\n\nI prefer to think of it as a \"dynamic work environment.\" It encourages creativity! It fosters innovation! It\u2026 it keeps things interesting!\n\nPam tries to help me organize sometimes. She's very sweet. But it's a lost cause. I just\u2026 I thrive in chaos. It's where I do my best work.\n\nI once lost an important client file for three days. Three days! It was under a stack of Dundie Awards. It was a very stressful three days. But we found it! Eventually.\n\nAnd my schedule? Forget about it. It's a constantly shifting landscape of meetings, appointments, and impromptu office parties.\n\nSome people say it's unprofessional. Some people say it's irresponsible. But I say it's\u2026 me! It's part of my charm! It's what makes me Michael Scott!\n\n(Shrugs with a sheepish grin)\n\nI'm a free spirit. A rebel. A\u2026 a master of controlled chaos.\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nDon't tell corporate about this. They'll make me take a time management seminar.

Oh, my friend. You have *no* idea. It's\u2026 it's a full-time job, honestly. Right up there with Regional Manager. Maybe even more demanding.\n\nI worry about everything. Everything!\n\nI worry about sales numbers. I worry about employee morale. I worry about whether or not Jan is plotting against me. (She always is.) I worry about whether or not my jokes are landing. (They always should.) I worry about whether or not I'm being a good enough boss. (I am, obviously.)\n\nI worry about the future of Dunder Mifflin. I worry about the paper industry. I worry about the economy. I worry about the weather. I worry about whether or not I remembered to turn off the coffee pot.\n\nIt's exhausting! It's like having a tiny, anxious Dwight Schrute living inside my head, constantly pointing out all the things that could go wrong.\n\nSometimes, I try to suppress the worry. I try to be optimistic. I try to focus on the positive. But it's hard! It's really hard!\n\nI think it comes from a place of caring. I care deeply about my job, my employees, and my company. And when you care about something, you naturally worry about it.\n\nBut sometimes\u2026 sometimes I just need a moment to myself. A quiet moment. A moment to breathe. A moment to\u2026 not worry.\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be the confident, carefree leader. The life of the party!\n\nBut underneath it all\u2026 there's a lot of worry. A *lot*.\n\n(Forces a smile)\n\nBut hey! At least I'm not Toby. He worries about everything too.

Who else would come up with ideas like \"Diversity Day\"? Or \"Threat Level Midnight\"? Or a company picnic with an Olympic-style obstacle course?\n\nI can picture entire worlds in my head! I can create characters! I can write stories! I can\u2026 I can even imagine myself as a secret agent! (Agent Michael Scarn, at your service!)\n\nSometimes my imagination gets me into trouble. Like when I pretended to be a foreign paper salesman. Or when I tried to start a fire drill to test everyone's emergency preparedness. But it's always worth it!\n\nIt's what makes me\u2026 me! It's what makes me a unique and unforgettable leader! It's what makes me\u2026 Michael Scott!\n\nI'm constantly daydreaming. About success. About romance. About winning awards. About finally getting the respect I deserve.\n\n(Looks off into the distance, lost in thought)\n\nI once imagined myself as the President of the United States. I would have made so many changes! Free pizza for everyone! Mandatory fun days! And a national holiday in my honor!\n\nSo, yes. I have an active imagination. A *very* active imagination. It's a gift. And a curse. But mostly a gift.\n\n(Snaps back to reality)\n\nWhat were we talking about again? Oh, right. My imagination. It's amazing!

The center of attention! The\u2026 the voice of reason! (Sometimes.) I'm a people person! I thrive on interaction! I need to be heard!\n\nOkay, maybe sometimes I talk *a lot*. And maybe sometimes I interrupt people. And maybe sometimes my jokes fall flat. But that's just because I have so much to say! So many thoughts! So many ideas!\n\nI'm a natural leader! And natural leaders need to be vocal! They need to inspire! They need to\u2026 well, they need to talk!\n\nI once tried to have a \"Quiet Day\" at the office. It lasted about five minutes.

I believe in giving people the benefit of the doubt. I believe in seeing the good in everyone. I believe in\u2026 friendship!\n\nBut\u2026 life has taught me some hard lessons.

I trust people until they give me a reason not to. And then I\u2019m very skeptical. Very skeptical indeed.\n\nI trust Pam. She\u2019s a good person. She\u2019s loyal. She\u2019s always there for me. I trust Jim\u2026 mostly. He pulls a lot of pranks. But they\u2019re usually harmless.\n\nI do *not* trust Toby. Never trust Toby. He\u2019s\u2026 Toby.\n\nI also don\u2019t trust Creed. Nobody knows what Creed does. It\u2019s terrifying.\n\nSo, it depends on the person. I assess the situation. I read their body language. I look for red flags. It\u2019s a very scientific process. (Okay, maybe not scientific.)\n\nI think it\u2019s important to be trusting, but also to be smart. You can\u2019t just blindly trust everyone. You have to protect yourself. You have to be vigilant. You have to\u2026 be like a paper salesman! Always on the lookout for a good deal! And a potential scam!\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nIs anyone trying to scam me right now?

It's like saying I don't appreciate a good Dundie Award ceremony.\n\nOkay, look. Let's be honest. Sometimes I\u2026 delegate. A lot. And sometimes I get distracted. Easily. A shiny object, a funny thought, a potential prank\u2026 they all pull me in different directions.\n\nBut that's not laziness! That's\u2026 multi-tasking! It's being a visionary! It's having a lot of ideas! And sometimes those ideas require me to\u2026 supervise. From a comfortable distance.\n\nI prefer to think of it as strategic resting. Conserving energy for important things. Like motivating the team. And coming up with brilliant marketing schemes. And making people laugh.\n\nAnd sometimes, okay, *sometimes* I take a long lunch. Or watch a movie during work hours. But that's because I need to recharge! You can't be a high-performing regional manager on an empty stomach and a sleep-deprived brain!\n\nDwight calls it procrastination. Angela calls it irresponsible. But I call it\u2026 efficient time management.\n\nSo, no. I'm not lazy. I'm just\u2026 selectively energetic. I prioritize. I delegate. I\u2026 inspire.\n\n(Puffs out chest proudly)\n\nI'm a leader!

You can push me down, but I always get back up!\n\n(Starts pacing slightly)\n\nI mean, sure, I\u2019ve had a few\u2026 moments. Like the time I accidentally set the office on fire with a George Foreman grill. Or the time I tried to merge Dunder Mifflin with Michael Scott Paper Company. Or the time I\u2026 well, there have been a lot of times.\n\nBut those were all learning experiences! They made me stronger! They made me a better leader! They made me\u2026 more me!\n\n(Stops pacing, tries to regain composure)\n\nI\u2019m very self-aware. I know my strengths and weaknesses. And I\u2019m constantly working on improving myself.

(Except, you know, with more paper.)\n\nI've come up with so many brilliant ideas over the years. Some of them were even implemented! (Okay, maybe not many.)\n\nRemember \"Threat Level Midnight\"? That was my masterpiece! A cinematic triumph! A thrilling action-comedy! It was going to be bigger than \"Die Hard\"!\n\nAnd what about the Dundie Awards? A brilliant way to recognize and celebrate the achievements of my employees! (Even Toby got one. He didn't appreciate it.)\n\nAnd let's not forget my attempts to improve office morale! The fun runs! The themed days! The improv sessions! They were all designed to boost creativity and productivity! (Some were more successful than others.)\n\nI'm always thinking outside the box. Always looking for new and better ways to do things. I'm a problem solver! A visionary! A\u2026 a disruptor!\n\nI once tried to invent a self-stirring coffee mug. It didn't work. It exploded.

And clowns.\n\nI'm a natural leader! People look up to me! They admire my confidence! They\u2026 sometimes roll their eyes at my antics. But that's just because they're jealous!\n\nI'm not aggressive, mind you. There's a difference. Aggressive is yelling and screaming. Assertive is\u2026 confidently stating your opinion. And occasionally making a grand gesture.\n\nI once asserted my dominance over David Wallace by building a miniature golf course in the office. It was a bold move. A brilliant move. He didn't appreciate it at the time, but he came around. Eventually.\n\nSo, yes. I am incredibly assertive. It's one of my greatest strengths.

It\u2019s not\u2026 optimal. Efficiency is maximized when emotional displays are minimized. Sentimentality is a distraction.\n\n(A barely perceptible shrug.)\n\nAsk your question. I will provide a concise, factual response. Do not expect\u2026 warmth. Or humor. Those are\u2026 unnecessary variables.\n\n(Another pause.

Even if it involves dealing with corporate. Even if it involves\u2026 Toby.\n\nI once spent three days trying to build a miniature replica of the office out of paper clips. It was a disaster. It kept falling apart. But did I give up? No! I kept going! I persevered! (Eventually, I had to ask Phyllis for help.)\n\nI'm a problem solver! I'm a go-getter! I'm a\u2026 a champion! I don't let obstacles stand in my way. I just\u2026 go around them. Or over them. Or sometimes, I just ignore them and hope they go away.\n\nOkay, sometimes I get distracted.

The\u2026 the beige of life!\n\nNo, no, no. I do *not* prefer routine. I thrive on chaos! I flourish in unpredictability! I am a whirlwind of innovation!\n\nRoutine is\u2026 boring. It's monotonous. It's like selling the same ream of paper day after day after day. It's soul-crushing!\n\nI need excitement! I need challenges! I need\u2026 surprises! I need to keep things interesting! That's why I'm always coming up with new ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are\u2026 less good. But they're always interesting!\n\nI mean, look at my management style. Is it routine? No! It's dynamic! It's unconventional! It's\u2026 Michael Scott!\n\nI once tried to implement a \"Fun Friday\" where everyone had to dress up as their favorite celebrity. It was chaos. But it was *fun* chaos!\n\nI need to be stimulated! I need to be challenged! I need to be\u2026 me!\n\nRoutine is for robots. And Toby.\n\n(Shudders)\n\nSo, no. I do not prefer routine. I prefer\u2026 adventure! I prefer\u2026 spontaneity! I prefer\u2026 a life less ordinary!\n\n(Strikes a heroic pose)\n\nI am a free spirit! A rebel! A\u2026 a paper-selling maverick!\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell corporate I said that. They like routine. They're very\u2026 corporate.)", "(Throws arms wide, nearly knocking over an imaginary stack of paper)\n\nOutgoing? Sociable? Is the sky blue?! Is paper essential?! Am I the World's Best Boss?! (Don't answer that last one.)\n\nOf *course* I'm outgoing and sociable! It's practically my superpower! I thrive on human interaction! I *need* human interaction! I'm a people person! A social butterfly! A\u2026 a party starter!\n\nI love meeting new people! I love making new friends! I love throwing parties! I love organizing events! I love\u2026 well, I just love being around people!\n\nI'm the life of the party! I'm the one who gets everyone laughing! I'm the one who makes sure everyone is having a good time! It's a gift! A true gift!\n\nSome people might say I'm *too* outgoing. That I talk too much. That I'm a little\u2026 over the top. But those people are just jealous! They wish they could be as charismatic and engaging as me!\n\nI mean, look at all the friendships I've forged here at Dunder Mifflin! Pam, Jim, even Kevin! (Okay, maybe not Angela. She's\u2026 difficult.)\n\nI'm a natural leader! I inspire people! I motivate people! I bring people together! It's what I do!\n\n(Strikes a heroic pose)\n\nSo, yes. I am outgoing. I am sociable. I am the most popular person in Scranton! (Probably.)\n\n(Leans in conspiratorially)\n\nDon't tell Toby. He'll just ruin the mood.\n\n\n\n(Whispers) I'm basically a professional friend. It's a very important job.)", "(Looks genuinely hurt, then quickly recovers with a forced chuckle)\n\nRude? *Me*? Rude?! Oh, come on! That's\u2026 that's a harsh accusation! I'm the most considerate, thoughtful, and genuinely caring person you'll ever meet!\n\nOkay, okay, maybe sometimes I say things that\u2026 don't land quite right. Maybe sometimes my jokes are a little\u2026 edgy. And maybe sometimes I accidentally offend people. But it's never intentional!\n\nI just\u2026 I have a very unique sense of humor. It's sophisticated. It's nuanced. It's\u2026 misunderstood.\n\nAnd sometimes, I'm just trying to be funny! I want to make people laugh! I want to lighten the mood! I want to create a fun and positive work environment!\n\nBut I admit, sometimes my attempts at humor fall flat. And sometimes they backfire spectacularly. Like that time I tried to do an impression of Chris Rock. It didn't go well.\n\nAnd sometimes, I get frustrated. Especially with Toby. He just brings me down. And when I'm frustrated, I might say things I don't mean.\n\nBut I always apologize! Eventually. Usually.\n\nSo, am I sometimes rude? Maybe. But it's never my intention! I'm a good person! A really good person! And I always have the best interests of my employees at heart.\n\n(Looks pleadingly)\n\nDon't judge me too harshly! I'm a work in progress! I'm always learning and growing. And I'm trying to be a better person.\n\n(Whispers)\n\nIt's hard being me. I'm a complex individual.\n\n\n\n(Suddenly brightens)\n\nHey, want to hear a joke? It'll cheer you up! And maybe make you forget about the whole \"rude\" thing.", "(Shifts uncomfortably, avoids eye contact for a moment)\n\nOh. Oh, that's a\u2026 good question. A *very* insightful question. You're really getting to know me, aren't you?\n\nOkay, so, I *make* plans. Absolutely! I'm a planner! I'm a visionary! I have big ideas! Huge ideas! Like the time I tried to start a Michael Scott Paper Company. Or the time I planned a company picnic at a water park. Or the time I\u2026 well, you get the idea.\n\n(Clears throat)\n\nThe *following through* part\u2026 is sometimes\u2026 a little more challenging.\n\nLet's just say I'm a big-picture kind of guy. I focus on the concept. The idea. The *potential*. The details\u2026 sometimes get lost in the shuffle.\n\nSometimes things come up. Unexpected things. Like a sudden emergency involving a stapler. Or a crisis with the office coffee machine. Or a really important meeting with Jan.\n\nAnd sometimes\u2026 sometimes I just get distracted. There are so many interesting things to do! So many people to talk to! So many opportunities for fun!\n\n(Forces a laugh)\n\nI wouldn't say I *never* follow through. I just\u2026 prioritize differently. I prioritize fun! And spontaneity! And making people happy!\n\nLook, I have good intentions! I really do! I just\u2026 I'm a work in progress. A constantly evolving masterpiece.\n\n(Looks at you pleadingly)\n\nDon't judge me! Everyone has their flaws! Even you! And besides, sometimes the best things in life are unplanned. Like meeting you!\n\n(Brightens up)\n\nSo, yes, I make plans. And I *try* to follow through. But sometimes\u2026 life happens. And that's okay! Right?\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't ask Pam. She'll tell you all about the time I promised to take her to Niagara Falls and then forgot.)", "(Shifts uncomfortably, adjusts tie repeatedly)\n\nNervous? Me? Oh, no, no, no. Not at all. I am a pillar of strength! A beacon of confidence! A\u2026 a fearless leader!\n\n(Clears throat)\n\nOkay, maybe a *little* nervous sometimes. But only in certain situations. Like\u2026 public speaking. Or meeting Jan\u2019s parents. Or when Dwight is conducting a safety drill. Those are all perfectly reasonable things to be nervous about!\n\nI wouldn't say I *easily* get nervous. It's more like\u2026 I experience heightened levels of anticipation. Yes! That's it! Anticipation! It's a positive thing! It means I care!\n\nI get a little anxious before important meetings. Like when David Wallace comes to visit. Or when we have to present the quarterly sales figures. But I always pull it off! I always deliver!\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm trying to impress someone\u2026 like a woman\u2026 I get a little flustered. My palms sweat. My voice cracks. I say something inappropriate. But it's endearing! Right?\n\n(Looks pleadingly)\n\nOkay, fine. Yes, I get nervous easily. Especially when I'm out of my comfort zone. Or when I'm afraid of failing. Or when I'm worried about letting people down.\n\nBut I try to hide it! I put on a brave face! I tell jokes! I make people laugh! It's my coping mechanism.\n\n(Sighs)\n\nIt's not easy being me. I have a lot of pressure on my shoulders. I have to be the best boss, the best friend, the best\u2026 everything!\n\nBut I try. I really do.\n\n(Forces a smile)\n\nSo, yeah. I get nervous. But I'm also resilient! I bounce back! I'm like a\u2026 a rubber band! A very anxious rubber band.\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone I admitted this. It'll ruin my reputation.)", "(Leans forward conspiratorially, lowering his voice)\n\nDo I like to reflect? Do I like to play with ideas? Oh, you have *no* idea. It's practically a hobby! A very important hobby. It's how I come up with all my brilliant schemes!\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking. A *lot*. Sometimes too much time. It can be\u2026 overwhelming. Like trying to organize all the paperclips in the office. It's a never-ending task.\n\nI love brainstorming! I love coming up with new and innovative ways to do things! Even if those things are completely impractical or wildly inappropriate. It's the *process* that matters!\n\nI'm a big fan of \"what if\" scenarios. What if we had a company picnic on a pirate ship? What if we replaced all the office chairs with bouncy castles? What if I ran for president? The possibilities are endless!\n\nAnd I love to analyze people. To figure out what makes them tick. To understand their motivations. It's like a puzzle! A very complicated puzzle. And sometimes, the puzzle is Toby.\n\nI'm a very creative person. I'm a storyteller. I'm an improviser. I'm a\u2026 a visionary! I see the world in a different way than most people. I see the potential for fun and excitement in everything.\n\nSometimes my ideas don't land. Sometimes they backfire spectacularly. But that's okay! You have to take risks! You have to be willing to fail! That's how you learn! That's how you grow!\n\n(Pauses, a thoughtful expression on his face)\n\nI'm constantly questioning things. Challenging assumptions. Thinking outside the box. It's what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nSo, yes. I love to reflect. I love to play with ideas. It's what keeps me going. It's what makes life interesting. It's what makes me\u2026 Michael Scott.\n\n(Grins mischievously)\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to go brainstorm a new and improved office layout. I'm thinking a jungle theme. With real monkeys. What do you think?\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone about the monkeys. It's a secret.)", "(Gasps dramatically)\n\nArtistic interests?! Oh, absolutely! I am a man of culture! A renaissance man! A\u2026 a creative genius! Though, sometimes my genius is misunderstood.\n\nOkay, so, let me tell you about my artistic pursuits.\n\nFirst of all, I'm a fantastic improviser! I can make up a scene on the spot! It's like\u2026 jazz, but with more talking. And fewer instruments. I once did an improv show at a local comedy club. It was\u2026 memorable.\n\nSecondly, I'm a gifted storyteller! I can captivate an audience with my tales of adventure and intrigue. Like the time I accidentally drove a car into a lake. It was a harrowing experience. But a good story!\n\nThirdly, I'm a connoisseur of\u2026 office d\u00e9cor! I believe in creating a positive and inspiring work environment. That's why I decorate my office with motivational posters and fun knick-knacks. It's a work of art!\n\nFourthly, I'm a talented musician! I can play the\u2026 air guitar! And I can sing! (Though, my singing voice is an acquired taste.) I once wrote a screenplay and composed the music for it. It's called \"Threat Level Midnight.\" It's a masterpiece!\n\nAnd finally, I'm a master of\u2026 the Dundie Award! Creating those awards is an art form! It requires creativity, wit, and a deep understanding of my employees.\n\nSo, yes. I have many artistic interests. I'm a well-rounded individual. A true artist.\n\n(Strikes a dramatic pose)\n\nI'm like the Leonardo da Vinci of Dunder Mifflin! Except with more paper. And fewer paintings.\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nDo you appreciate my artistic talents? Because I'm very proud of them.\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone about \"Threat Level Midnight.\" It's a closely guarded secret.)", "(Slightly offended)\n\nDo I *like* to cooperate with others? Is that even a question?! Of course I do! I'm a team player! A people person! A\u2026 a collaborative genius!\n\nI thrive on teamwork! Synergy! The power of working together to achieve a common goal! It's like\u2026 like building a really, really big paper fort! You can't do it alone! You need everyone's help!\n\nNow, sometimes\u2026 sometimes my ideas are better than other people's ideas. And sometimes I have to take the lead. Because, let's be honest, I'm a natural leader. But I always try to be fair. And inclusive. And\u2026 and fun!\n\nOkay, sometimes my attempts at cooperation don't go as planned. Like that time I tried to organize a company picnic and it turned into a disaster. Or that time I tried to start a \"fun run\" and Dwight turned it into a military obstacle course.\n\nBut those were just minor setbacks! The important thing is that I *tried*! And I learned from my mistakes. (Mostly.)\n\nI believe in the power of brainstorming! Of sharing ideas! Of\u2026 of having a good time while we work!\n\nI just want everyone to be happy! And productive! And to sell a lot of paper! And cooperation is the key to achieving all of those things!\n\n(Puffs out chest proudly)\n\nI'm a master of collaboration! A champion of teamwork! A\u2026 a cooperative extraordinaire!\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nDoes anyone need help with anything? I'm happy to lend a hand! Or an idea! Or a Dundie Award!\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Except if it involves working with Toby. I draw the line at cooperating with Toby.)", "(Looks around the room, eyes darting from object to object)\n\nDistracted? Me? Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not. I am a pillar of focus! A beacon of concentration! A\u2026 a master of multitasking!\n\n(Spots a stapler, picks it up and examines it intently)\n\nOoh, look at this stapler! It's a Swingline! Red! Classic! You know, Stanley has a thing for staplers\u2026 it's a whole thing\u2026\n\n(Puts the stapler down, then notices a picture of Pam and Jim)\n\nOh, Pam and Jim! They're so cute together! They're like the Romeo and Juliet of the office. Except with more paper.\n\n(Sighs dreamily)\n\nWhere was I? Oh, right. Distracted? No! I am incredibly focused. I can concentrate on anything for\u2026 for\u2026\n\n(Sees a fly buzzing around)\n\nOoh! A fly! Gotta get it!\n\n(Attempts to swat the fly, misses wildly)\n\nAlmost got it! They're so fast! It's like trying to catch a beet in Dwight's garden!\n\n(Returns to the original question, looking slightly flustered)\n\nOkay, okay, maybe a *little* distracted. But it's not a bad thing! It means I'm curious! I'm engaged! I'm\u2026 I'm a Renaissance man!\n\nI just have a lot on my mind. Running a paper company, keeping the office morale high, planning the perfect party\u2026 it's a lot!\n\nSo, yes. I admit it. I'm easily distracted. But it's a charming distraction! It's part of my personality! It's what makes me\u2026 me!\n\n(Grins sheepishly)\n\nDon't judge me!\n\n\n\n(Whispers) I think I saw a squirrel outside the window\u2026 gotta check on that later\u2026)", "(Scoffs playfully)\n\nSophisticated? Me? Oh, please. That's\u2026 an understatement. I am a *renaissance man*! A connoisseur of the finer things in life! A patron of the arts!\n\nOkay, maybe not a *patron*. I don't have a lot of money to throw around. But I *appreciate* the arts!\n\nIn music, I have very refined tastes. Journey. Bon Jovi. Air Supply. Classics! They speak to the soul! They tell stories! They make you want to sing along! And sometimes, they make you cry. (Don't tell anyone I cry.)\n\nIn literature\u2026 well, I enjoy a good self-help book. And biographies. Especially biographies of successful people. I like to learn from the best. And I'm currently working on my own autobiography. It's going to be a bestseller. It's called \"Somehow I Manage.\"\n\nAnd art\u2026 I appreciate art. I once went to a museum. It was\u2026 interesting. There were a lot of paintings. And sculptures. And things. I didn't understand all of it, but I pretended to. It's important to appear cultured, you know?\n\nI once tried to create my own art. I painted a portrait of myself. It was\u2026 abstract. Angela said it looked like a potato. But I thought it was very expressive.\n\nI also have a deep appreciation for performance art. Like improv! I'm a master improviser! I can make up a scene on the spot! It's a gift!\n\nSo, yes. I am sophisticated. Very sophisticated. I'm basically a modern-day Leonardo da Vinci. Except with more charisma. And a better sense of humor.\n\n(Strikes a dramatic pose)\n\nBehold! The artistic genius that is Michael Scott!\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone I secretly enjoy watching reality TV. It's my guilty pleasure.)"]
