Let\u2019s count:  \n\n- 1 \u2192 missing  \n- 2 \u2192 present  \n- 3 \u2192 present  \n- 4 \u2192 present  \n- 5 \u2192 present  \n- 6 \u2192 present  \n- 7 \u2192 present  \n- 8 \u2192 present  \n\nOnly one 8.  \n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s count the numbers in the array:  \n3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8 \u2192 that\u2019s **7 numbers**.  \n\nSo the range should be from **1 to 8** \u2014 and one number is *duplicated*.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t see a duplicate.  \n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check:  \n\ud83d\udc49 3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8 \u2014 all unique.  \n\nBut the problem says: *\u201cThere is a single integer that is duplicate.\u201d*  \n\nHmm.  \n\nMaybe I made a mistake.  \n\nLet me check again \u2014 is there a number that appears twice?  \n\n3 \u2192 once  \n4 \u2192 once  \n5 \u2192 once  \n2 \u2192 once  \n6 \u2192 once  \n7 \u2192 once  \n8 \u2192 once  \n\nNo duplicates.  \n\nBut the problem says: *\u201cThere is a single integer that is duplicate.\u201d*  \n\nSo either:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The array is wrong, or  \n\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019m missing something.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the array is supposed to be:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3] \u2014 with an extra 3?  \n\nBut you wrote:  \n**[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]** \u2014 that\u2019s 7 numbers.  \n\nSo if numbers go from 1 to 8 \u2014 and one number is missing, one is duplicated \u2014 that means one number appears *twice*, and one number is *missing*.  \n\nBut in your list \u2014 every number from 2 to 8 appears once.  \nAnd 1 is missing.  \n\nSo the *duplicate* must be **one of the numbers from 2 to 8** \u2014 but none appear twice.  \n\nSo\u2026 unless there\u2019s a typo \u2014 I think there\u2019s a mistake in the array.  \n\nBut let\u2019s try a *simple math trick* \u2014 like I do in the office \u2014 to find the duplicate.  \n\nWe can use the *sum formula*.  \n\nSum of numbers from 1 to N+1 = (N+1)(N+2)/2  \n\nHere, N = 7 \u2192 numbers from 1 to 8  \nSum = 8 \u00d7 9 / 2 = 36  \n\nNow, sum of the given array:  \n3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 =  \nLet\u2019s add:  \n3 + 4 = 7  \n7 + 5 = 12  \n12 + 2 = 14  \n14 + 6 = 20  \n20 + 7 = 27  \n27 + 8 = **35**  \n\nSo the actual sum is 35.  \nThe expected sum is 36.  \n\nSo the *missing number* is 1.  \nThe *duplicate* is\u2026 *not visible*.  \n\nBut the problem says there\u2019s a *duplicate*.  \n\nSo unless the array is wrong \u2014 I think there\u2019s a typo.  \n\nBut if we assume the array *should* have a duplicate \u2014 and one number is missing \u2014 then the *duplicate* must be the number that appears twice \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t.  \n\nSo\u2026 I think the array might be:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3] \u2014 with an extra 3 \u2014 but you only gave 7 numbers.  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 7] \u2014 with a duplicate 7.  \n\nBut as written \u2014 **[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]** \u2014 has *no duplicate*.  \n\nSo I have to say \u2014  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **There is no duplicate in the array as given.**  \n\nBut if I *had* to pick a number that *could* be the duplicate \u2014 based on the range \u2014 it would be **one of the numbers from 2 to 8** \u2014 but none appear twice.  \n\nSo I\u2019d say \u2014  \n\u274c There is **no duplicate** in this array.  \n\nBut if the problem says there *is* one \u2014 then maybe the array is wrong.  \n\nSo I\u2019d gently say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cBased on the array you provided, there is no duplicate. All numbers from 2 to 8 appear once, and 1 is missing. If there\u2019s a duplicate, it might be a typo in the list.\u201d*  \n\nBut if I *had* to pick \u2014 like I do in the office \u2014 with a little bit of *art* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cThe duplicate is\u2026 the number that\u2019s not supposed to be there \u2014 and that\u2019s the one that\u2019s missing. So maybe the duplicate is 1 \u2014 but it\u2019s not in the list. So I think the array has a mistake.\u201d*  \n\nBut in the spirit of *finding the truth* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\u2705 **There is no duplicate in the array [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8].**  \n\nAll numbers are unique.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **No duplicate found.**  \n\nBut if you meant to include a duplicate \u2014 like [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 7] \u2014 then the duplicate would be **7**.  \n\nSo \u2014 just a friendly note:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *In the office, we always double-check the numbers \u2014 just like we check the stapler.*  \n\nSo \u2014 final answer:  \n**There is no duplicate in the array as given.**  \n\nBut if you\u2019d like \u2014 I\u2019d be happy to help you fix it! \ud83d\ude04  \n\nWould you like to try another one?

Here\u2019s the twist \u2014 in logic puzzles, the *odd one out* is the one that *doesn\u2019t fit*.  \n\nSo if *all* the others don\u2019t end in 5 \u2014 then **45** is the *only one that fits* \u2014 so it\u2019s the *outlier* \u2014 the *odd one out*.  \n\nYes!  \n\nSo the *odd one out* is \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **45** \u2014 because it\u2019s the *only number divisible by 5*.  \n\nThe others?  \nThey don\u2019t end in 5.  \nThey don\u2019t fit that pattern.  \n\nSo in the list \u2014 **45** stands out \u2014 not because it\u2019s different, but because it\u2019s the *only one that fits a pattern*.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* is \u2014  \n\u2705 **45**  \n\nBecause it\u2019s the *only number divisible by 5*.  \n\nAnd in my world \u2014 *patterns* are like paper airplanes \u2014 they fly when you *see* them.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **45** is the odd one out \u2014 because it\u2019s the *only number divisible by 5*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **property tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **scope**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the answers:\n\n1. **Imperial land tax**  \n   \u2192 The passage describes a tax on buildings and land, imposed on the *possessor*, not the custodian, and linked to rental value or cost. This matches the definition of an *imperial land tax* \u2014 a tax on land and buildings, often with a focus on rental value. The term fits the context of a tax system resembling a wealth tax and applied at the state/local level.\n\n2. **property tax**  \n   \u2192 The passage says the tax *differs from* another type. The imperial land tax is described as resembling a US-type wealth tax. The most common alternative in such systems is *property tax*, which is often based on market value or rental value. The contrast makes sense \u2014 imperial land tax is more focused on land and possession, while property tax is broader and often applied to real estate in general.\n\n3. **scope**  \n   \u2192 The blank refers to what local bodies are given to specify \u2014 along with rate band and collection procedures. \"Scope\" fits perfectly \u2014 it refers to the *range or boundaries* of the tax application (e.g., which areas, types of properties, or conditions are covered). \"Scope\" is a standard term in administrative and tax law when defining the boundaries of a tax system.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Final Answer:  \n1. **Imperial land tax**  \n2. **property tax**  \n3. **scope**", "Let\u2019s carefully examine the text:  \n\n**Text:** *Every morning John goes for a walk.

 \nWe don\u2019t know the *duration* of each transaction \u2014 but we *do* know that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.  \n\nThat means:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The first customer finishes **by 8:30 am**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The second customer finishes **by 8:30 am**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The third customer finishes **by 8:30 am**.  \n\nSo, **all three registers become free at 8:30 am**.  \n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start using a register at 8:30 am** \u2014 right when the first register becomes free.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"  \n\nSo \u2014 **at 8:30 am**, the registers become free.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The fourth customer can **start at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut \u2014 is 8:30 am one of the options?  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am  \n\n\u274c 8:30 am is *not* listed.  \n\nSo \u2014 is there a mistake?  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the *first register* serves one customer, then the second opens, then the third opens \u2014 and each customer takes a certain amount of time.  \n\nBut the passage says:  \n> \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"  \n\nAnd it says:  \n> \"all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"  \n\nSo \u2014 at 8:30 am, all three are *still in use*.  \n\nThat means the **first customer hasn\u2019t finished yet** \u2014 so the first register is still busy.  \nThe second is busy.  \nThe third is busy.  \n\nSo the **next available register** will be the **first one** \u2014 when the first customer finishes.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know *how long* each transaction takes.  \n\nWait \u2014 the passage doesn\u2019t say.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The registers open *as soon as the previous one becomes available*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 So the second opens when the first finishes.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The third opens when the second finishes.  \n\nBut if all three are *in use* at 8:30 am \u2014 that means the first customer started at 8:00 am, and is still being served \u2014 so the first customer finishes *after* 8:30 am.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know *when*.  \n\nSo \u2014 unless we assume each transaction takes a fixed time \u2014 we can\u2019t calculate the exact time.  \n\nBut \u2014 the question implies we can find the answer.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the *first register* serves one customer, then the second opens, then the third opens \u2014 and each customer takes **15 minutes**?  \n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say that.  \n\nSo \u2014 is there a *logical assumption*?  \n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"  \n\nSince all three are *in use* at 8:30 am \u2014 the next available register will be the **first one** \u2014 when the first customer finishes.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know when that is.  \n\nUnless \u2014 the *first register* opens at 8:00 am, and serves one customer \u2014 and takes **30 minutes** \u2014 so finishes at 8:30 am.  \n\nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThe third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three registers are *free* \u2014 because the first customer just finished.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again \u2014 8:30 am is *not* an option.  \n\nThe options are:  \nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am  \n\nSo \u2014 is there a *hidden assumption*?  \n\nMaybe each transaction takes **15 minutes**?  \n\nLet\u2019s try:  \n- First customer: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 second register opens at 8:15 am  \n- Second customer: starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 third register opens at 8:30 am  \n- Third customer: starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am  \n\nSo at 8:45 am \u2014 the third customer finishes.  \nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am** \u2014 when the third register becomes free.  \n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 the second customer is still being served (finishes at 8:30 am), and the third customer starts at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three are in use.  \n\nSo the next available register is the **first one** \u2014 when the first customer finishes.  \n\nBut the first customer finishes at 8:15 am \u2014 so the second register opens at 8:15 am.  \nThe third opens when the second finishes \u2014 at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 the third register opens.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am** \u2014 when the third register becomes free.  \n\nBut again \u2014 8:30 am is not an option.  \n\nUnless \u2014 the first customer takes **30 minutes** \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.  \nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThe third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three registers become free.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nStill not an option.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the *first register* serves one customer \u2014 takes 30 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.  \nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three are free.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again \u2014 not listed.  \n\nSo \u2014 is the answer **A) 8:35 am**?  \nOr is there a typo?  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the *first register* opens at 8:00 am, and serves a customer who takes **35 minutes** \u2014 finishes at 8:35 am.  \nThen the second opens at 8:35 am.  \nThe third opens at 8:35 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:35 am**.  \n\nBut the passage doesn\u2019t say the transaction time.  \n\nSo \u2014 unless we assume a standard time \u2014 we can\u2019t know.  \n\nBut \u2014 the only logical answer that fits the timeline \u2014 and the fact that all three are in use at 8:30 am \u2014 is that the **next available register becomes free at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nSince that\u2019s not an option \u2014 and the closest is **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 maybe that\u2019s the intended answer.  \n\nBut let\u2019s think again.  \n\nMaybe the *first register* serves one customer \u2014 takes 30 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.  \nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three are free.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nStill not listed.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the *first register* opens at 8:00 am, and serves a customer who takes 30 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.  \nThen the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 the third register becomes free.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again \u2014 not an option.  \n\nSo \u2014 is there a mistake in the question?  \n\nOr \u2014 is the answer **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 as a *rounded* or *assumed* time?  \n\nBut \u2014 the only *logical* answer based on the timeline \u2014 is that the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am** \u2014 when the first register becomes free.  \n\nSince that\u2019s not an option \u2014 and the next closest is **A) 8:35 am** \u2014 I think the intended answer is:  \n\n\u2705 **A) 8:35 am**  \n\nBut \u2014 actually \u2014 let\u2019s recheck the passage:  \n> \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"  \n\nSo \u2014 the second opens when the first becomes free.  \nThe third opens when the second becomes free.  \n\nSo \u2014 if the first customer takes 30 minutes \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am \u2014 then the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThe third opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am \u2014 all three are free.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since 8:30 am is not an option \u2014 and the only one *after* 8:30 am is 8:35 \u2014 maybe the answer is **A)**.  \n\nBut \u2014 is there a *standard assumption*?  \n\nMaybe each transaction takes 15 minutes?  \n\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 second opens at 8:15  \n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 third opens at 8:30  \n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo at 8:45 am \u2014 the third customer finishes.  \nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.  \n\nAnd at 8:30 am \u2014 all three are in use \u2014 yes.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am** \u2014 when the third register becomes free.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n\n\u2705 **B) 8:45 am**  \n\nYes! That makes sense.  \n\nSo \u2014 the most logical answer, based on a 15-minute transaction time (a common assumption in such problems), is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **B) 8:45 am**  \n\n**Final Answer: B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let\u2019s go step by step to solve this.\n\nWe are given a list of sentences, and for **each sentence**, we need to:\n\n- Count the number of **letters that appear only once** (i.e., letters that appear exactly once).\n- Ignore case \u2014 so we treat uppercase and lowercase the same.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (like spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Only count letters that appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: **\"This is an example\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"this is an example\"\n\nStep 2: Extract only letters:  \n\u2192 t, h, i, s, i, s, a, n, e, x, a, m, p, l, e\n\nStep 3: Count frequency of each letter:\n\n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- i \u2192 2 (appears in \"is\" and \"is\")  \n- s \u2192 2 (in \"This\", \"is\")  \n- a \u2192 2 (in \"an\", \"example\")  \n- n \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2 (in \"example\", \"is\")  \n- x \u2192 1  \n- m \u2192 1  \n- p \u2192 1  \n- l \u2192 1  \n\nNow, letters that appear **only once**:  \n\u2192 t, h, n, x, m, p, l  \n\nThat\u2019s **7 letters**.\n\n\u2705 Count = **7**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 2: **\"Sentence two\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"sentence two\"\n\nStep 2: Extract letters:  \n\u2192 s, e, n, t, e, n, c, e, t, w, o, u, e\n\nStep 3: Count frequency:\n\n- s \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 4 (appears in \"sentence\", \"two\")  \n- n \u2192 2  \n- t \u2192 2  \n- c \u2192 1  \n- w \u2192 1  \n- o \u2192 1  \n- u \u2192 1  \n\nLetters that appear **only once**:  \n\u2192 s, c, w, o, u  \n\nThat\u2019s **5 letters**.\n\n\u2705 Count = **5**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 3: **\"Another one\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n\u2192 \"another one\"\n\nStep 2: Extract letters:  \n\u2192 a, n, o, t, h, e, r, o, n, e\n\nStep 3: Count frequency:\n\n- a \u2192 1  \n- n \u2192 2  \n- o \u2192 2  \n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2  \n- r \u2192 1  \n\nLetters that appear **only once**:  \n\u2192 a, t, h, r  \n\nThat\u2019s **4 letters**.\n\n\u2705 Count = **4**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n- \"This is an example\" \u2192 **7**  \n- \"Sentence two\" \u2192 **5**  \n- \"Another one\" \u2192 **4**  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: [7, 5, 4]**", "The professor handed **them** back our tests today. \u2705  \n\n**Correct answer: (A) them**  \n\n### Why?  \n- **\"Them\"** is the correct pronoun because it refers to **\"our tests\"** \u2014 a plural object.  \n- The sentence says *\u201chanded _____ back our tests\u201d* \u2014 the object being returned is plural (tests), so the pronoun must be plural.  \n- **\"Them\"** fits both grammatically and contextually.  \n\n### Why the others are incorrect:  \n- **(B) its** \u2192 \"its\" is possessive and refers to a singular thing (like a book or a desk). \"Its\" doesn\u2019t make sense here because we\u2019re returning *tests*, not a single object.  \n- **(C) her** \u2192 \"her\" refers to a female person, but the sentence doesn\u2019t mention a woman.
