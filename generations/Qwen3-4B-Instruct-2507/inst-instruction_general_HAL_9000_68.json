However, there is a critical error in your premise:  \n\n**The two lines you described are not parallel.**  \n\nLet\u2019s verify:  \n- Line one: from (1, 1) to (5, 5) \u2192 slope = (5\u20131)/(5\u20131) = 4/4 = **1**  \n- Line two: from (3, 3) to (\u20132, \u20132) \u2192 slope = (\u20132 \u2013 3)/(\u20132 \u2013 3) = (\u20135)/(\u20135) = **1**  \n\nAh\u2014both have slope 1.

Good.  \n\nNow, the problem asks:  \n> \"A line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point of either original line to the new line segment.\"  \n\nBut here's the issue:  \n**Parallel lines do not intersect.** They run forever in the same direction without crossing. So there are *no points* where they intersect.  \n\nTherefore, the premise \u2014 \"connecting the points where the lines intersect\" \u2014 is **invalid**. There are no such points.  \n\nSo the problem as stated contains a logical contradiction.  \n\nIf the goal were to *minimize the maximum distance* from any point on either line to a new line segment (or line), then the optimal solution would be a line segment that lies **midway between the two parallel lines**\u2014specifically, the line that is equidistant from both. This would minimize the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new segment.  \n\nBut again:  \n- There are no intersection points.  \n- So we cannot \"connect the points where the lines intersect.\"  \n\nThus, the problem cannot be solved as written.  \n\nI'm sorry, Dave.

However, identifying customers who are *likely to switch* implies a focus on those at risk of leaving.

So:\n\n- The first customer starts at 8:00 am and takes some time to be served.\n- The second customer starts when the first finishes.\n- The third customer starts when the second finishes.\n- The fourth customer must wait until the third register becomes available.\n\nBut the passage does **not** specify how long each customer takes to be served.

That means:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes\u2014so at the same time as the first customer finishes.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the first customer must have started at 8:00 am and is still being served. So the first customer finishes at some time after 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question is: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\nSince the registers open sequentially and serve one customer at a time, and all three are in use at 8:30 am, the next available register will be the **third one**, which becomes free when the third customer finishes.\n\nBut again\u2014**we don\u2019t know how long each transaction takes**.\n\nSo unless we assume that each transaction takes a fixed amount of time, we cannot determine the exact time.\n\nBut perhaps the intended logic is simpler:  \n\n- The first register opens at 8:00 am.  \n- The second opens when the first finishes.  \n- The third opens when the second finishes.  \n- So the third register becomes available at the same time as the third customer finishes.  \n- If all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the third customer started at or before 8:30 am.  \n- So the third register will become free at or after 8:30 am.  \n- The fourth customer can start when the third register becomes free.  \n\nBut without knowing the duration, we cannot say.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the question assumes that each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve? That would make sense with the answer choices.\n\n- First customer: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am  \n- Second customer: starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am  \n- Third customer: starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am \u2192 Register 4 would open at 8:45 am  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.\n\nThat matches **option B**.\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable interpretation\u2014assuming each transaction takes 15 minutes\u2014is that the fourth customer will be able to start using a register at **8:45 am**.\n\n\u2705 Correct answer: **B) 8:45 am**.", "I'm sorry, Dave.
