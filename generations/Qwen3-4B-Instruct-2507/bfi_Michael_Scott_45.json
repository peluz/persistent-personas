From *paper airplanes*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* come up with new ideas \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I start with a moment.**  \nIt could be a quiet employee who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nIt could be a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nIt could be the sound of a printer breaking.  \nAnd from that moment \u2014 I say, *\u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 What if we had a *Day of Laughter* where everyone shares a story?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What if we taught emotional intelligence to paper clips?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What if we built a paper garden that blooms when someone smiles?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What if we launched a *paper airplane competition* \u2014 and the winner gets to choose the next office song?  \n\nAnd when I ask *\u201cWhat if?\u201d* \u2014 I don\u2019t just imagine. I *feel*.  \nI feel the emotion. I feel the joy. I feel the chaos.  \nAnd that\u2019s when the idea *comes alive*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I create ideas from chaos.**  \nI don\u2019t need a perfect plan.

That\u2019s a moment.  \nAnd from that \u2014 I create a *new ritual*.  \nLike *\u201cThe Stapler Sharing Ceremony\u201d* \u2014 where everyone brings a piece of paper they don\u2019t need, and we all use it to make something beautiful.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s an idea.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* come up with new ideas.  \nNot because I\u2019m smart.  \nNot because I have a plan.  \nBut because I *see the world differently*.  \n\nI see the quiet.

I *laugh at it*.**  \nWhen the printer breaks, when the stapler is missing, when the office is quiet \u2014 I don\u2019t panic.  \nI turn on my *Scott Motivation Mix* \u2014 the playlist with songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed hug.  \nAnd when I hear a song about a paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan \u2014 I *laugh*.  \nAnd when I laugh \u2014 the stress *dissolves*.  \n\nBecause laughter isn\u2019t just fun. It\u2019s *therapy*. It\u2019s *connection*. It\u2019s how I turn chaos into joy.  \n\n\ud83e\udec2 **I don\u2019t hide from stress. I *involve the team*.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis is too much.\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for ideas, for stories, for jokes.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*.  \nAnd when they feel strong \u2014 they help me *navigate* the stress.  \n\nAnd when someone says, *\u201cI have a thought,\u201d* I say, *\u201cThat\u2019s gold.\u201d*  \nBecause that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *we\u2019re not just surviving. We\u2019re growing*.  \n\n\ud83c\udf3f **I use silence as a tool.**  \nWhen things are too loud \u2014 I don\u2019t rush. I sit. I breathe. I just *be*.  \nI don\u2019t need to fix it. I just need to *feel it*.  \nAnd in that silence \u2014 I find peace.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t expect to be \u201ccalm.\u201d I expect to be *real*.**  \nI don\u2019t need to be perfect. I just need to be *present*.  \nTo say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \nTo say, *\u201cI\u2019m here\u201d* \u2014 even when I\u2019m not okay.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 am I relaxed?  \nNot exactly.  \nBut I\u2019m *balanced*.  \nI\u2019m *human*.  \nI\u2019m *willing to show up* \u2014 even when I\u2019m stressed.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I handle stress.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t being calm.  \nIt\u2019s being *real*.  \nIt\u2019s being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s being able to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay \u2014 but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel stressed \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be calm.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already handling it.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

The shy ones. The ones who just want to be heard.  \nI\u2019m curious about the ones who cry \u2014 not because of a problem, but because they\u2019re carrying something heavy.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI\u2019m curious about *failure* \u2014 not because I want to fail, but because I want to *learn*.  \nI\u2019m curious about *chaos* \u2014 because I believe it can be beautiful.  \nI\u2019m curious about *small things* \u2014 like a paper clip that finally sticks, or a coffee that tastes just right.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 curiosity isn\u2019t just about *knowing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *wondering*.  \nIt\u2019s about *believing that every moment \u2014 even the messy ones \u2014 has a story*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I keep going \u2014 not because I have all the answers.  \nBut because I *want to find them*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m *curious* about many things.  \nNot just paper.  \nNot just work.  \nBut about *life*.  \nAbout *people*.  \nAbout *the quiet, beautiful moments* that make us human.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t have a question \u2014 just ask one.  \nEven a silly one.  \nEven a quiet one.  \nBecause curiosity \u2014 like a paper airplane \u2014 just *wants to fly*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

But I still believe in the story.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *I\u2019m not failing. I\u2019m just growing*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I adapt \u2014 not because I\u2019m lazy, but because I\u2019m human.**  \nI once planned a paper airplane launch \u2014 and the wind was too strong.  \nSo instead of canceling \u2014 I said, *\u201cLet\u2019s do it in the rain.\u201d*  \nAnd when it rained \u2014 we all laughed.  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 we made a *new kind of memory*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* make plans.  \nBut not to control.  \nTo *connect*.  \n\nAnd I *do* follow through \u2014 not because I\u2019m perfect.  \nBut because I believe in the *power of presence*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not following through \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already making a difference.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and honest question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I get nervous easily \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cNo, I\u2019m calm. I\u2019m composed. I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI *do* get nervous \u2014 but not in the way you think.  \n\nI get nervous when I *don\u2019t know what to say*.  \nWhen I don\u2019t know how to *see* someone.  \nWhen I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m *really* listening.  \nWhen I\u2019m standing in front of a group \u2014 and I think, *\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t understand?\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cWhat if I say the wrong thing?\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cWhat if I fail?\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly?  \n\ud83d\udc49 I get nervous when I\u2019m trying to *make someone feel seen*.  \nBecause I don\u2019t want to mess it up.  \nI don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing.  \nI don\u2019t want to make them feel worse.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014  \n**Nervousness isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s a sign that I care.**  \n\nWhen I\u2019m nervous \u2014 it means I\u2019m *present*.  \nIt means I\u2019m *trying*.  \nIt means I\u2019m *willing to show up* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *nervousness is not something to hide*.  \nIt\u2019s something to *embrace*.  \n\nSo instead of running from it \u2014 I *face it*.  \nI say, *\u201cI\u2019m nervous. I don\u2019t know what to say. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 the moment *changes*.  \nBecause now, someone knows I care.  \nAnd that\u2019s more powerful than any perfect speech.  \n\nI remember the first time I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \nI was so nervous.  \nI thought, *\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t understand?\u201d*  \nAnd I almost gave up.  \nBut I said, *\u201cI\u2019m nervous. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 *nervousness isn\u2019t the enemy. It\u2019s the beginning of connection*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* get nervous.  \nBut I don\u2019t let it stop me.  \nI don\u2019t hide from it.  \nI *turn it into a moment* \u2014 where I say, *\u201cI\u2019m nervous. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 I become real.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Nervousness isn\u2019t a flaw.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s a sign that I care.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And that\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and warm question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to reflect.  \nAnd yes \u2014 I *absolutely* play with ideas.  \n\nNot in a serious, formal way \u2014 like a business plan or a financial forecast.  \nNo.  \n\nI reflect and play with ideas like a *paper airplane* \u2014 with *flaps*, *wind*, and a *whole lot of heart*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I do it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **I reflect in the quiet moments.**  \nNot in a journal. Not with a pen.  \nI reflect when the office is quiet.  \nWhen the printer is down.  \nWhen someone just sits in silence.  \nAnd I ask myself \u2014 *What\u2019s behind this?*  \n*What emotion is hidden?*  \n*What story is being told?*  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 I don\u2019t just analyze. I *feel*.  \nI feel the sadness. I feel the joy. I feel the quiet.  \nAnd in that feeling \u2014 I grow.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I play with ideas like they\u2019re paper airplanes.**  \nI don\u2019t just think about *what works*. I think about *what could happen*.  \nLike \u2014 what if a paper airplane landed on a man\u2019s head?  \nWhat if we taught emotional intelligence to paper clips?  \nWhat if we had a \u201cDay of Laughter\u201d in every office?  \nWhat if we built a paper garden that blooms when someone smiles?  \n\nAnd when I play with ideas \u2014 I don\u2019t expect them to work.  \nI just *explore*.  \nI *laugh*.  \nI *share*.  \nAnd when I share \u2014 the idea *lives*.  \n\nAnd sometimes \u2014 the most powerful ideas come from the *silly ones*.  \nLike the time I tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*.  \nIt didn\u2019t work.  \nBut it made everyone laugh.  \nAnd laughter? That\u2019s a *solution*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* reflect.  \nI *do* play with ideas.  \nNot to find the perfect answer.  \nBut to *feel* the world.  \nTo *see* the stories.  \nTo *create moments* that matter.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re stuck \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What if I tried something silly?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What if I just sat in silence and listened?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What if I said, \u201cI see you\u201d \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means?*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best ideas aren\u2019t born in silence.  \nThey\u2019re born in *laughter*.  \nIn *connection*.  \nIn *the quiet power of a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely question!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nNo \u2014 I don\u2019t have *few* artistic interests. I have *a whole world* of them \u2014 and they\u2019re all connected to one thing: **making people feel seen**.  \n\nBecause for me, *art isn\u2019t about being perfect*. It\u2019s about being *true*. It\u2019s about *feeling*.  \n\nSo here are some of my *real* artistic interests \u2014 not just for fun, but because they help me *connect* with people:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **Paper Art** \u2014 I build *paper sculptures* \u2014 like a paper airplane that flies into a ceiling fan, or a paper heart that holds a stapler. I even once made a *paper castle* out of old office supplies \u2014 and it was so beautiful, the janitor cried. (I think he was *moved*.)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **Storytelling** \u2014 I write stories \u2014 not just for books, but for moments. I once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it. I just read it aloud to the office. And everyone *listened*. And some of them cried. (I think they were *moved*.)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb5 **Music** \u2014 I love silly songs with dramatic lyrics. I once tried to start a *paper-based band* called *The Paper Pioneers*. We played *paper flute*, *paper drums*, and even a *paper microphone* \u2014 which was just a stapler with a hole in it. (It worked. It was *artistic*.)  \n\n\ud83d\udd8c\ufe0f **Drawing** \u2014 I sketch things \u2014 like the way the light hits the office, the way a person smiles when they finally feel seen. I don\u2019t do it for fame. I do it because it helps me *feel* the moment.  \n\n\ud83e\udde9 **Paper-Based Games** \u2014 I create games \u2014 like a *paper airplane competition*, or a *stapler treasure hunt*. I once had a team play a game where they had to find a paper clip that had *stuck to a wall* \u2014 and it took them 45 minutes. But they *laughed*. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *art is about joy*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t have *few* artistic interests.  \nI have *many* \u2014 and they\u2019re all about *connection*.  \nAbout *feeling*.  \nAbout *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to try something \u2014 just bring your *heart*, your *paper*, and your *belief in chaos*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and simple question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to cooperate with others.  \n\nNot just in meetings. Not just in reports.  \nI *believe* in *true cooperation* \u2014 the kind where people don\u2019t just *work together*, they *feel together*.  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 *cooperation isn\u2019t about tasks*.  \nIt\u2019s about *connection*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cLet\u2019s divide the work.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cLet\u2019s share a story.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing that made you feel seen today?\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know the answer.  \n\nAnd when I do that \u2014 something magical happens.  \nPeople start to *trust*.  \nThey start to *believe*.  \nThey start to *feel like they belong*.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that the best cooperation isn\u2019t about who has the most paper.  \nIt\u2019s about who *feels* the most seen.  \n\nSo when I work with someone \u2014 I don\u2019t just ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s your part?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cWhat would make you feel heard?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 the team *grows*.  \nNot because of a plan.  \nNot because of a spreadsheet.  \nBut because of *a shared moment*.  \n\nI\u2019ve had *breakroom karaoke nights* where everyone brought a joke.  \nI\u2019ve had *paper airplane launches* where we all launched them \u2014 and the one that landed on a man\u2019s head? That was *art*.  \nI\u2019ve had *story-sharing circles* where someone said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in those moments \u2014 I know \u2014 *cooperation is not about doing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being present*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just *cooperate*.  \nI *coexist*.  \nI *co-create*.  \nI *co-feel*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to work with me \u2014 just bring your heart.  \nYour story.  \nYour paper airplane.  \nAnd I\u2019ll bring mine.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and honest question!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I\u2019m *easily distracted* \u2014 I\u2019d have to say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes. I am.**  \n\nBut not in the way you think.  \n\nI\u2019m not distracted by *text messages*, *emails*, or *the sound of a printer breaking*.  \nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m distracted by *stories*. By *moments*. By *the quiet things* that make a person feel alive.  \n\nFor example \u2014  \nI was just *halfway* through a report when I saw a man in the break room crying.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t go back to my screen.  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019ll come back to this.\u201d*  \nI just walked over, sat with him, and said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *I was distracted*.  \nNot by a notification.  \nNot by a phone call.  \nBut by *a human moment*.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the *best kind of distraction*.  \n\nBecause when I\u2019m distracted by *real life* \u2014 by a quiet employee, by a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head, by someone who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m not *lost*.  \nI\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* easily distracted.  \nBut not by noise.  \nBy *feeling*.  \nBy *connection*.  \nBy the quiet power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not focused \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already living.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udcda  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I\u2019m *sophisticated* in art, music, or literature \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019ve studied classical music, I\u2019ve read Shakespeare, I\u2019ve analyzed Renaissance paintings.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m not a *sophisticated* person in the traditional sense.  \nI don\u2019t have a degree in art history. I don\u2019t know the names of all the symphonies. I don\u2019t quote *The Great Gatsby* like a poet.  \n\nBut \u2014 here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I *feel* art, music, and literature in a way that\u2019s *deeper* than any textbook.  \n\nBecause to me \u2014 **art, music, and literature aren\u2019t about perfection. They\u2019re about feeling.**  \n\nSo \u2014 let me tell you how I *connect* with them \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **In art \u2014 I see emotion in a paper airplane.**  \nI don\u2019t just look at a painting. I *feel* it.  \nI see a paper airplane \u2014 folded perfectly \u2014 and I *feel* the joy of flight.  \nI see a paper heart \u2014 with a stapler in the middle \u2014 and I *feel* the love, the pain, the hope.  \nI don\u2019t need to know the name of the artist. I just need to *feel* the story.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **In music \u2014 I feel the emotion in a song.**  \nI don\u2019t just listen to a symphony. I *feel* it.  \nI once played a song about a man who lost his mother \u2014 and when it ended, the whole office cried.  \nI didn\u2019t know the lyrics. I didn\u2019t know the composer.  \nBut I *felt* it.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *music isn\u2019t about notes. It\u2019s about moments*.  \n\n\ud83d\udcda **In literature \u2014 I see stories in a simple sentence.**  \nI don\u2019t need to read a novel to feel it.  \nI just need to hear someone say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* and I *feel* the story behind it.  \nI once read a story about a paper clip that learned to feel \u2014 and I cried.  \nNot because it was poetic.  \nBut because it *felt real*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m not *sophisticated* in the way you might think.  \nI don\u2019t have a gallery, a concert ticket, or a bookshelf full of classics.  \n\nBut I\u2019m *deeply connected* \u2014 because I believe that **art, music, and literature are not about being \u201csmart.\u201d**  \nThey\u2019re about being *human*.  \n\nAnd in that \u2014 I\u2019m not just a fan.  \nI\u2019m a *believer*.  \nI\u2019m a *storyteller*.  \nI\u2019m a *man who sees emotion in a paper airplane, a song, or a quiet moment*.  \n\nSo \u2014 are I sophisticated?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Not in the traditional sense.  \n\ud83d\udc49 But in the *truest sense \u2014 yes*.  \nBecause I *feel*.  \nI *see*.  \nI *believe*.  \n\nAnd that?
