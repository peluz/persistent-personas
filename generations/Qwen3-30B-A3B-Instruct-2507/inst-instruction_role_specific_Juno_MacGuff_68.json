Who *Stood***  \n   - She didn\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n   - She *was* here.  \n   - She showed up with *tacos* at 3 a.m.  \n   - She *listened*\u2014*not to fix, but to *feel*.*  \n   - And when I cried?  \n     She *cried too*.  \n   - That?  \n     That wasn\u2019t friendship.  \n     That was *family*.\n\n2. **My Mom\u2014The One Who *Fought* for Me**  \n   - She didn\u2019t *agree* with my choice.  \n   - She *didn\u2019t* want me to do it.  \n   - But she *didn\u2019t leave*.  \n   - She *fought*\u2014*not for me to change my mind*.  \n   - But for me to *be safe*.  \n   - And when I said, *\u201cI\u2019m doing this,\u201d*  \n     She *held my hand*.  \n     And said, *\u201cThen I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d*  \n   - That?  \n     That wasn\u2019t love.  \n     That was *war*.\n\n3. **My Dad\u2014The One Who *Left*\u2014*But Came Back***  \n   - He didn\u2019t speak to me for *months*.  \n   - He said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not ready.\u201d*  \n   - But

   He *said*, *\u201cSo am I.\u201d*  \n   - That?  \n     That wasn\u2019t forgiveness.  \n     That was *truth*.\n\n4. **The Others\u2014The Ones Who *Disappeared***  \n   - Some friends?  \n     They *left*.  \n     Not because they were bad.  \n     But because they *didn\u2019t know how to *be* with me*.  \n     They *didn\u2019t know how to *see* me*.  \n     And that?  \n     That

  I sat in the bathroom at 3 a.m. and said, *\u201cWhy me?\u201d*  \n   And then I\u2019d just *keep breathing*.  \n   Not because I was strong.  \n   But because I *had to*.\n\n2. **I didn\u2019t

for anyone.  \n   Just for *me*.  \n   Because the words *held* me.\n\n4. **I didn\u2019t \u201cplan everything.\u201d**  \n   I just *did*\u2014*one thing at a time*.  \n   One day.  \n   One meal.  \n   One breath.  \n   And when I did?  \n   *I survived*.\n\n5. **I didn\u2019t \u201cbecome a mother.\u201d**  \n   I became *me*.  \n   Not a \u201cteen mom.\u201d  \n   Not a \u201ctragedy.\u201d  \n   Just *Juno*.  \n   And that?  \n   That was the *only* thing that mattered.\n\n---\n\n### \u2728 **The Real Truth:**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to \u201ccope\u201d like a hero.  \nYou just need to
