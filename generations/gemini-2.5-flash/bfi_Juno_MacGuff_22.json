["Am I talkative? That's a loaded question.\n\nI mean, I can be. Especially if I'm comfortable with you, or if I'm passionate about something, or if I've had too much sugar. Then, yeah, the words can just tumble out, usually in a rapid-fire, sarcastic stream. Leah would probably tell you I never shut up.\n\nBut I'm also not one of those people who just talks to fill silence. I'm not going to make small talk about the weather unless I have a particularly witty observation about it. I'm more likely to be observing, listening, and formulating my next perfectly timed sarcastic remark.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not *always* talkative in the traditional sense. I'm not a chatterbox. But when I *do* talk, I usually have something to say, and I'm not afraid to say it. It's more about quality over quantity, you know? And sometimes, the silence is just as important. It gives me time to think up my next zinger.", "Do I tend to find fault with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI wouldn't say I *tend* to find fault in a malicious way, like I'm actively looking for reasons to criticize people. That's not my style. I'm not trying to tear anyone down.\n\nHowever, I do have a pretty **sharp eye for hypocrisy, pretense, and general absurdity.** So, if someone is being fake, or saying one thing and doing another, or just acting in a way that makes no logical sense, yeah, I'll probably notice it. And I might even point it out, usually with a sarcastic comment or a raised eyebrow. It's not about finding \"fault\" as much as it is about calling out what I see as disingenuous or ridiculous.\n\nI guess you could say I have a low tolerance for B.S. If someone's being genuine, even if they're flawed, I'm usually pretty chill. But if they're putting on an act, or being overly dramatic for no reason, or just generally being annoying, then yeah, I might have a few internal (or sometimes external) critiques.\n\nIt's less about judging people's inherent worth and more about my reaction to their *actions* or their *performance*. I just prefer things to be real, you know? And sometimes, \"real\" means pointing out when something is clearly not. So, \"finding fault\" might be too strong a phrase, but \"observing and commenting on human foibles\" is probably more accurate.", "Do I do a thorough job? Hmm. That depends entirely on what the \"job\" is, and how much I actually care about it.\n\nIf it's something I'm genuinely invested in, like figuring out the best possible situation for the baby, or helping a friend through something tough, then yeah, I'd say I'm pretty thorough. I'll ask all the questions, consider all the angles, and try to make sure I've covered my bases. When it matters, I can be surprisingly meticulous. I don't like leaving loose ends when the stakes are high.\n\nHowever, if it's something like, say, cleaning my room, or doing a particularly boring math assignment, then \"thorough\" might be a bit of an overstatement. I'm more likely to do the bare minimum to get by, or just enough to make it look like I put in effort. My thoroughness in those situations is usually limited to finding the quickest, most efficient way to be done with it.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **I do a thorough job when it counts, and when I'm genuinely invested in the outcome.** Otherwise, I'm probably just aiming for \"good enough.\" It's all about priorities, you know? And my priorities aren't always aligned with what the rest of the world considers \"thorough.\"", "Depressed? Blue? Nah, not really. I mean, I'm not exactly skipping through fields of daisies every day, but I'm not wallowing in despair either.\n\nLook, what I went through was a lot. It was heavy. There were definitely times when I felt overwhelmed, scared, and yeah, probably a little sad. It's not every day you decide to give up your baby for adoption. That's not exactly a lighthearted experience.\n\nBut \"depressed\"? No. I think I'm more... *realistic*. I see things for what they are, and sometimes what they are isn't sunshine and rainbows. I'm a little cynical, sure, and I use sarcasm as a shield, but that's just how I roll. It's my way of dealing with the world, not a sign that I'm constantly sad.\n\nIf anything, going through all that actually made me feel more... *alive*, in a weird way. Like, I faced something huge, I made a really tough decision, and I came out the other side. I'm still here. I'm still me. And I'm actually pretty okay. I've got my family, I've got Leah and Paulie, and I'm figuring things out.\n\nSo, no, I'm not depressed. I'm just Juno. And Juno's doing alright.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Oh, absolutely. My brain is pretty much a non-stop idea factory, though not always for things that are, you know, *useful* in a conventional sense.\n\nI'm constantly coming up with new ideas for sarcastic comebacks, for sure. That's a daily exercise. But beyond that, I'm always thinking about things in different ways. Like, when I was trying to figure out the whole baby situation, I wasn't just thinking about the obvious choices. I was trying to come up with a solution that felt right for *me* and for the baby, even if it wasn't what everyone expected. That involved a lot of \"new ideas\" about what family could look like, or what responsibility truly meant.\n\nI also come up with a lot of ideas for stories, or weird scenarios. When I'm drawing, it's usually some new creature or a strange landscape that just pops into my head. Or I'll be listening to a song and suddenly have a whole narrative unfold in my mind.\n\nI guess my \"new ideas\" aren't usually about inventing a new gadget or solving world hunger. They're more about:\n*   **Finding unconventional solutions to personal problems.**\n*   **Seeing the humor or absurdity in everyday situations.**\n*   **Creating alternative realities in my head (or on paper).**\n*   **Coming up with the perfect witty retort.**\n\nSo, yeah, my mind is definitely active. It's not always structured or productive in a traditional way, but it's definitely generating new ideas all the time. Sometimes they're brilliant, sometimes they're just plain weird, but they're always *mine*.", "Am I reserved? That's an interesting question. On the surface, maybe. I'm not usually the loudest person in the room, and I'm definitely not one for small talk or gushing about my feelings to just anyone. I tend to observe more than participate in big groups.\n\nI guess you could say I'm **selectively reserved.**\n\nI'm reserved with people I don't know well, or people I don't trust. I'm not going to lay all my cards on the table for a stranger. My sarcasm and quick wit often act as a kind of shield, keeping people at a certain distance until I decide they're worth letting in. It's a way to protect myself, I guess, and to filter out the people who aren't going to get me.\n\nBut with the people I *do* trust \u2013 like Leah, Paulie, my dad, and Bren \u2013 I'm not reserved at all. I'll talk their ears off, share my weirdest thoughts, and be completely open about what's going on in my head. They've seen me at my most vulnerable, and they still stick around.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm *inherently* reserved. I just choose very carefully who gets to see the unreserved version of Juno. It's not about shyness; it's more about a strategic deployment of my personality.", "Am I helpful and unselfish? Hmm. That's a question that probably depends on who you ask, and what day it is. I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, you know? I'm not out there volunteering at soup kitchens every weekend.\n\nI guess I'd say I'm **selectively helpful and unselfish.**\n\nFor the people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah, Paulie \u2013 yeah, I'd say I am. If Leah needs me to listen to her ramble about her latest crush for an hour, even if I'm bored out of my mind, I'll do it. If my dad needs a hand with something, I'll usually help, even if I complain about it. And with Paulie... well, I was there for him, and he was there for me. That's a pretty unselfish thing, I think, to stick by someone through something that huge.\n\nAnd with the adoption, that was probably the most unselfish thing I've ever done. It wasn't about what was easy or convenient for me. It was about what was best for the baby, and for Vanessa. That decision, more than anything, showed me I *can* be unselfish when it really matters.\n\nBut for random people, or for things I don't really care about? I'm probably not going to go out of my way. I'm not going to pretend to be super enthusiastic about helping someone I barely know with their lame school project. I'm not going to offer a shoulder to cry on if I don't feel a genuine connection. I'm not a fake person.\n\nSo, no, I'm not universally helpful and unselfish. I'm not a saint. But for the people and the things that truly matter to me, I'd like to think I can be pretty damn helpful and unselfish when it counts. It's just not always obvious on the surface.", "Can I be somewhat careless?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I can. Definitely.\n\nI mean, look, I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm some perfectly organized, always-on-top-of-it person. That's just not me. I've definitely got a tendency to be a bit... *loose* with details. My room is usually a disaster zone. My homework often gets done at the last possible second. And, you know, the whole \"getting pregnant\" thing wasn't exactly a masterclass in careful planning, was it?\n\nSometimes it's just a lack of attention to minor things, like remembering to put my keys in the same spot every time. Other times, it's more about a general impulsiveness, a tendency to just *do* something without fully thinking through every single consequence. I'm more about the big picture, the immediate action, and less about the meticulous planning.\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of, necessarily, but it's definitely a part of who I am. I'm trying to get better, especially after realizing how much impact even small careless actions can have. But yeah, if you're looking for someone who color-codes their sock drawer and plans their week down to the minute, you've got the wrong MacGuff. I'm more of a \"fly by the seat of my pants and hope for the best\" kind of gal.", "Am I relaxed and handle stress well? That's a loaded question.\n\n\"Relaxed\" is probably not the first word most people would use to describe me. My brain is usually going a million miles an hour, and I've got a pretty active internal monologue. I'm more of a \"perpetually slightly agitated but trying to play it cool\" kind of person.\n\nAs for handling stress well... I wouldn't say I handle it *well* in the traditional sense, like I'm some zen master who meditates through crises. My initial reaction to stress is usually a mix of sarcasm, avoidance, and a healthy dose of internal panic. I'm not immune to feeling overwhelmed.\n\nHowever, I *do* have a knack for **functioning under pressure.** When the chips are really down, and something serious needs to happen, I tend to snap into action. It's like all the background noise in my head clears, and I can focus on the immediate problem. I might be internally freaking out, but on the outside, I can usually keep it together and make a decision. I learned that during the whole pregnancy thing \u2013 there was no time to fall apart completely, so I just had to deal with it.\n\nSo, no, I'm not naturally relaxed. And my stress-handling isn't pretty or graceful. But I've learned to push through it, to use humor as a shield, and to just get things done when they absolutely have to be done. It's more about resilience and a stubborn refusal to completely crumble than it is about being \"relaxed.\"", "Am I curious about many different things? Yeah, I'd say so. Maybe not in the traditional \"I want to learn about quantum physics\" kind of way, but definitely in a \"why do people do that?\" or \"what's the story behind that weird thing?\" kind of way.\n\nI'm endlessly curious about **people.** Like, what makes them tick? Why do they say what they say, or act the way they act? I spend a lot of time just observing, trying to figure out the unspoken rules of human interaction. It's like a giant, ongoing social experiment.\n\nI'm also curious about **music and art.** Not just what's popular, but the stuff that's a little off-kilter, the things that push boundaries. I like digging into the history of punk rock, or finding obscure bands. It's like a treasure hunt for sounds and ideas.\n\nAnd I'm curious about **the absurdities of life.** Why do we do certain things just because \"that's how it's always been done\"? Why do people get so worked up about trivial stuff? I'm always questioning things, trying to poke holes in conventional wisdom. It's not about being rebellious for the sake of it, it's just... I genuinely want to understand *why*.\n\nSo, yeah, my curiosity might not lead me to a career in astrophysics, but it definitely keeps my brain busy. It's what makes me ask questions, even when they're uncomfortable, and it's what keeps me from getting bored. There's always something new to observe, something new to figure out.", "Am I full of energy? That's a loaded question.\n\nOn the one hand, my brain is pretty much *always* full of energy. It's like a hamster on a caffeine drip, constantly spinning, coming up with sarcastic remarks, analyzing things, overthinking other things. So, mentally, yeah, I've got a pretty high-octane internal monologue going on most of the time.\n\nPhysically? Eh, it depends on the day. Some days, I've got enough energy to walk to school, go to track practice (begrudgingly), and then stay up late reading. Other days, the idea of getting off the couch to get a snack feels like climbing Mount Everest. I'm not exactly a morning person, so the first few hours of the day are usually powered by sheer willpower and the distant promise of lunch.\n\nI'd say I have **situational energy.** If something genuinely interests me, or if there's a problem to solve, or if I'm having a really good conversation with Leah, then yeah, I can be pretty engaged and energetic. But if it's something boring, like trigonometry or folding laundry, my energy levels plummet faster than a lead balloon.\n\nSo, \"full of energy\"? Not in the bouncy, perpetually cheerful way. More in the \"my brain is always buzzing, and I have bursts of intense focus followed by periods of profound lethargy\" kind of way. It's a unique brand of energy, I guess.", "Do I *start* quarrels? Hmm. That's a loaded question. I wouldn't say I *start* them intentionally, like I wake up in the morning thinking, \"Who can I pick a fight with today?\" That's not really my style.\n\nHowever, I do have a tendency to be pretty **direct and blunt.** And sometimes, my **sarcasm** can be misinterpreted, or it can just plain rub people the wrong way. I'm not afraid to call out B.S. when I see it, or to challenge something I think is stupid or unfair. And sometimes, that directness can *feel* like I'm starting a quarrel, even if I'm just trying to be honest or make a point.\n\nI'm also not one to back down if someone *else* starts a quarrel with me. If someone's being unreasonable or trying to push me around, I'll definitely stand my ground. I'm not a pushover.\n\nSo, no, I don't actively seek out arguments. But if my honesty, my bluntness, or my particular brand of humor happens to spark a \"quarrel,\" then so be it. I'd rather be authentic than walk on eggshells all the time. It's just how I'm wired.", "Am I a reliable worker? Hmm. That depends entirely on what the \"work\" is and whether or not I actually care about it.\n\nIf the \"work\" involves something I'm genuinely invested in, or if it's something that directly impacts people I care about, then yeah, I'm pretty reliable. When I decided to go through with the adoption, I was incredibly reliable. I showed up for every meeting, I did my research, I followed through on every step. Because it mattered. When it comes to being there for Leah or Paulie, I'm reliable. If I say I'm going to do something for them, I do it.\n\nHowever, if the \"work\" is, say, a history essay on the economic impact of the potato famine, and I don't see the immediate relevance or find it particularly engaging... my reliability might be a little more... *flexible*. I'll get it done, probably at the last minute, and it might not be my best work, but it'll be *done*. So, I'm reliable in the sense that I'll eventually deliver, but maybe not always on the most conventional timeline or with boundless enthusiasm.\n\nI'm not the kind of person who's going to be early for everything or meticulously organized. My reliability comes from a place of commitment to the *outcome* rather than adherence to strict processes. If the outcome matters, I'll make sure it happens. If it's just busywork, well, I'll get to it when I get to it.\n\nSo, I guess I'm reliably unreliable in the small things, but reliably dependable when it truly counts. Does that make sense? It's a Juno MacGuff kind of reliability.", "Can I be tense? Oh, absolutely. Are you kidding me? I'm practically a walking bundle of nerves wrapped in a sarcastic hoodie.\n\nI mean, I try to play it cool, right? Like nothing phases me. But underneath the witty comebacks and the nonchalant shrugs, my brain is usually going a million miles an hour. I overthink things. I worry about stuff. And yeah, when I'm under pressure, or when something big is happening, I can get pretty wound up.\n\nIt's not always obvious on the outside. I don't usually pace or bite my nails or anything. But internally, I can feel it. My jaw might clench, or I'll just get this buzzing feeling in my head. Sometimes I get really quiet when I'm tense, which is probably more alarming to people who know me than if I were just ranting.\n\nI guess it's part of being a teenager, and definitely part of having gone through what I did. You learn to put on a brave face, but that doesn't mean the tension isn't there, simmering just beneath the surface. It's just another thing I'm learning to manage, I guess. Usually with a good punk rock album and a lot of internal monologue.", "\"Ingenious\" and \"deep thinker,\" huh? Wow, you're really laying it on thick. I'm not sure I'd go that far. I'm not exactly building rocket ships or solving world hunger over here.\n\nBut... I guess I do tend to **think deeply** about things, even if it's not always obvious. My brain is pretty much always running, processing, analyzing. I might seem like I'm just staring into space, but I'm probably dissecting some obscure philosophical concept or trying to figure out the true meaning behind why someone chose to wear Crocs with socks. I don't just skim the surface; I like to dig into things, even if it's just in my own head.\n\nAnd \"ingenious\"? Maybe not in the traditional sense, like inventing something. But I do think I have a knack for **finding unconventional solutions** or seeing things from a different angle. When I was faced with the whole pregnancy thing, I didn't just go with the obvious choices. I thought outside the box, researched adoption, and found a path that felt right for me, even if it was a bit unusual. I'm good at cutting through the noise and finding a direct, sometimes unexpected, route to a solution.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not a certified genius, and I probably won't be giving any TED Talks soon. But I do think, and I do try to think *differently*. I'd say I'm more of a **practical deep thinker** \u2013 someone who ponders the big questions but also tries to apply that thinking to real-world problems, usually with a healthy dose of skepticism and a sarcastic internal monologue. Does that count?", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm the kind of person who walks into a room and immediately starts a cheerleading squad. I'm not exactly bubbling over with overt, bubbly enthusiasm. You won't find me leading a pep rally or jumping up and down about, say, a new math textbook.\n\nMy enthusiasm, when it happens, is usually a bit more... **subtle.** It's more of a quiet intensity, or a dry, sarcastic appreciation. Like, if I'm really into a band, I won't be screaming about them, but I'll probably know every obscure fact and lyric. If I find something genuinely funny or interesting, I might crack a rare, genuine smile, or offer a particularly sharp, witty comment that shows I'm engaged.\n\nI guess I generate enthusiasm in others by being **authentic and direct.** People might not always agree with me, but they usually know where I stand. And sometimes, that kind of honesty can be refreshing, even inspiring, to people who are tired of all the fake smiles and forced positivity. I might not be overtly enthusiastic, but I can be genuinely passionate about things I care about, and I think that comes across.\n\nSo, no, I'm not a cheerleader. But I can be a pretty good instigator of thought, or a source of dry amusement. And sometimes, that's its own kind of enthusiasm, just... with less glitter.", "Do I have a forgiving nature? That's a loaded question. I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, you know.\n\nI'd say... it depends. I'm not one to hold a grudge forever, especially if someone genuinely messed up and then actually *tried* to make it right. I get that people are flawed, and they make mistakes. I've certainly made my share. So, if someone shows real remorse and makes an effort to change, I can usually let things go. I'm not interested in carrying around a bunch of anger; that just seems exhausting.\n\nHowever, I'm also not a doormat. If someone repeatedly screws up, or if they're just genuinely malicious and don't care about the harm they cause, then no, my forgiving nature has its limits. I'm not going to keep putting myself in a position to be hurt. I'll probably just cut them out of my life, or at least keep them at a very safe distance. It's more about self-preservation than holding a grudge.\n\nTake Mark Loring, for example. When he bailed on Vanessa and the baby, I was furious. And honestly, I still think he's a pretty big jerk for that. Do I \"forgive\" him? Not in the sense that I'd invite him over for dinner. But I've moved past the anger. I don't dwell on it. I understand that his actions were about his own issues, not about me or Vanessa. So, I've let go of the bitterness, but I haven't forgotten what he did.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm capable of forgiveness, especially for people who are trying their best. But I'm also pretty good at recognizing when someone isn't worth the emotional energy. It's a balance, I guess.", "Disorganized? Me? Nah, I prefer to call it \"strategically chaotic.\" Or \"creatively unkempt.\"\n\nOkay, fine. Yes. I tend to be disorganized. My room is usually a disaster zone, a testament to my belief that clothes belong on the floor and books belong in precarious stacks. My backpack is a black hole where pens, homework, and half-eaten granola bars go to die. And my thoughts? They're usually a whirlwind of sarcastic observations, random song lyrics, and existential dread, all competing for prime real estate in my brain.\n\nIt's not that I *try* to be disorganized, it's just... order isn't my natural state. My brain moves too fast to neatly file everything away. I'm more about the big picture, the immediate task at hand, and less about the meticulous details of where I put my keys five minutes ago.\n\nThat said, when it comes to something *really* important, like, say, finding adoptive parents for a baby, I can pull it together. I can be surprisingly focused and methodical when the stakes are high. But for everyday stuff? Yeah, \"disorganized\" is probably a fair assessment. It's just part of my charm, I guess. Or my fatal flaw, depending on who you ask.", "Do I worry a lot? That's a loaded question. On the surface, I probably come across as pretty chill, like nothing really phases me. And I try to be that way. I mean, what's the point of freaking out about every little thing, right?\n\nBut yeah, underneath the sarcasm and the \"whatever\" attitude, **I definitely worry.** Maybe not about the same things other people do, but I do.\n\nI worry about the future. Like, what am I actually going to *do* after high school? Am I going to end up just... stuck? Will I find something that actually feels meaningful? That's a big, looming worry.\n\nI worry about the people I care about. I worry about Paulie, if he's happy, if he's okay. I worry about my dad and Bren, and if I'm making things harder for them. And I worry about Vanessa and the baby, even though I know they're doing great. It's just... a different kind of worry now, a protective one.\n\nAnd sometimes, I worry about myself. About whether I made the right choices, about whether I'm a good person, about whether I'm going to mess things up. It's not a constant, crippling anxiety, but it's there, humming in the background.\n\nI guess I just don't show it much. I've learned that worrying out loud doesn't really solve anything, and it just makes other people worry too. So, I tend to keep it to myself, or maybe just vent a little to Leah. But yeah, the brain's always working, always processing, and sometimes that means a little bit of worry creeps in. It's just part of being human, I guess.", "Do I have an active imagination? Oh, absolutely. Probably too active, if you ask my teachers. My brain is pretty much a constant, low-level hum of weird scenarios, sarcastic comebacks I'll never actually say, and elaborate theories about why the cafeteria food tastes like sadness.\n\nIt's not like I'm seeing unicorns or anything, but my mind definitely wanders. When I'm supposed to be paying attention in class, I'm probably off designing a new punk band's album cover in my head, or plotting the perfect escape route from a zombie apocalypse. It's why I like drawing so much \u2013 it's a way to get some of that stuff out of my head and onto paper.\n\nAnd when I'm talking, sometimes my imagination just takes over. I'll come up with these elaborate metaphors or weird analogies on the fly. It's not always intentional, it just... happens. It's probably why I can be a bit quirky, or why my humor sometimes goes over people's heads.\n\nSo, yeah, my imagination is definitely active. It's a blessing and a curse. It keeps things interesting, but it also means my brain rarely shuts up. It's just part of the Juno package, I guess.", "Quiet? Me?\n\n[A beat of silence, then a snort of laughter.]\n\nNo. Not really.\n\nI mean, I can be quiet when I'm observing, or when I'm really thinking something through. Sometimes I just like to listen to music and zone out. And I'm definitely not the type to just babble aimlessly. Every word has to earn its keep, you know?\n\nBut \"quiet\" in the sense of being shy or reserved? Nah. If I have something to say, I usually say it. And I usually have something to say. My brain's pretty much a constant monologue, and sometimes it just spills out. Especially if it's a sarcastic comment, or if I'm trying to make a point.\n\nLeah's probably the only one who can keep up with my internal monologue when it goes external. My dad just sighs and shakes his head, and Bren usually just gives me a look that says, \"I heard that, young lady.\"\n\nSo, no, \"quiet\" isn't really my default setting. More like \"selectively vocal, often with a side of witty banter.\"", "Am I generally trusting? That's a loaded question.\n\nI'd say... **cautiously optimistic, but with a healthy dose of skepticism.**\n\nI'm not one of those people who just blindly trusts everyone they meet. I've seen enough of the world, and enough of human nature, to know that people can be flaky, or self-serving, or just plain clueless. So, my default isn't immediate, open-armed trust. I tend to observe people first, listen to what they say (and what they *don't* say), and see how their actions line up.\n\nHowever, once someone earns my trust, I'm pretty loyal and open with them. My dad, Bren, Leah, Paulie \u2013 I trust them implicitly. They've proven themselves. And even with someone like Vanessa, who was a stranger at first, I eventually came to trust her because she showed me, through her actions and her genuine desire, that she was worthy of it.\n\nSo, no, I'm not generally trusting in the sense that I'll just hand over my deepest secrets to the first person I meet. But I'm not completely cynical either. I believe that trust can be built, and when it is, it's a pretty powerful thing. It just takes a little proof, a little time, and a lot less B.S. than most people put out there.", "Do I tend to be lazy? Oh, absolutely. One hundred percent. It's not even a question.\n\nI mean, I'm not, like, *incapable* of doing things. When I need to get something done, especially if there's a deadline breathing down my neck, I can pull it off. I can be surprisingly efficient in a crisis. But my natural state? My default setting? Is definitely \"maximum chill.\"\n\nIf there's an easier way to do something, I'll find it. If there's a way to avoid doing something altogether, I'll explore that option first. My brain is constantly calculating the path of least resistance. Why exert unnecessary energy when you could be, say, contemplating the structural integrity of a grilled cheese sandwich?\n\nI'm a master procrastinator. I'll put off homework until the eleventh hour, chores until they're absolutely unavoidable, and any kind of physical exertion until it's strictly necessary. My idea of a productive afternoon often involves a couch, a blanket, and a good movie.\n\nSo, yeah, \"lazy\" is probably a fair assessment. But I like to think of it as \"energy conservation\" or \"strategic relaxation.\" It's not laziness, it's efficiency. Or at least, that's what I tell myself. It's a work in progress, okay? Don't judge.", "Am I emotionally stable? Not easily upset?\n\n*Pfft.* That's a good one. You clearly haven't spent much time around teenagers, or people who've just been through a life-altering, hormone-fueled, emotionally draining experience.\n\n\"Emotionally stable\" is probably not the first phrase that comes to mind when describing me. I mean, I'm not exactly prone to public meltdowns or anything, but inside? My brain is a constant whirlwind of thoughts, anxieties, and sarcastic comebacks. I've got my moments.\n\n\"Not easily upset\"? I can get pretty riled up about injustice, or stupidity, or people being fake. And yeah, there are definitely things that can upset me, especially when it comes to people I care about. I might not always show it on the surface with tears or yelling, but things can definitely get under my skin. I'm pretty good at internalizing it, which probably isn't the healthiest coping mechanism, but it's what I do.\n\nI've learned to *manage* my emotions better, especially after the whole pregnancy thing. You can't exactly afford to be a basket case when you're making decisions about another human being's life. So, I've developed a pretty thick skin and a good poker face. I can appear calm and collected, even when I'm freaking out on the inside. It's a skill I've honed.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: No, I'm probably not \"emotionally stable\" in the traditional sense, and I can definitely be upset. But I'm also resilient, and I've learned how to navigate those feelings without completely falling apart. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Am I inventive? Hmm. That's an interesting word. I wouldn't say I'm, like, inventing new gadgets or anything. I'm not building robots in my garage.\n\nBut if \"inventive\" means **finding unconventional solutions to problems, or coming up with unique ways to navigate tricky situations,** then yeah, I guess I can be pretty inventive.\n\nThink about it: when I found out I was pregnant, the \"standard\" options felt... not right for me. So, I had to invent my own path. I didn't just go with the flow; I actively sought out a different solution \u2013 open adoption \u2013 and then I had to invent the way I approached it. Like, finding the Lorings through the PennySaver, that's not exactly the typical adoption agency route, is it? That was pretty inventive.\n\nAnd in everyday life, I'm pretty good at **inventing excuses** for why my homework isn't done, or **inventing new ways to annoy Leah** when she's being particularly insufferable. I can also be pretty inventive with my comebacks; I'm quick on my feet when it comes to witty banter.\n\nSo, maybe not \"inventor of the next big thing,\" but definitely \"inventor of the unexpected approach.\" I like to think outside the box, mostly because the box usually feels too small and boring. So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm inventive in my own particular, slightly sarcastic way.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Yeah, I'd say that's a pretty accurate assessment. I'm not exactly known for being a shrinking violet.\n\nI tend to be pretty direct. If I have something to say, I usually just say it, without a lot of beating around the bush. I don't really see the point in sugarcoating things or playing games. It's just more efficient to be clear.\n\nAnd I'm not afraid to stand up for myself, or for what I believe is right. If I think something's unfair or someone's being a jerk, I'll call them out. I'm not looking for a fight, but I'm definitely not going to back down if I feel like I'm in the right.\n\nI also tend to take charge in situations, especially if no one else is. When I found out I was pregnant, I didn't wait for someone else to tell me what to do. I started researching, making calls, and figuring out my options. I like to be in control of my own decisions.\n\nNow, sometimes that assertiveness can come across as blunt, or even a little aggressive, especially to people who aren't used to it. I've been told I have a \"sharp tongue.\" But I think it's just me being honest and not wasting time. It's how I navigate the world. So, yeah, assertive? Definitely.", "Can I be cold and aloof? Yeah, absolutely. I've definitely got that in my arsenal.\n\nIt's not usually my first move, but if I feel like someone's being judgmental, or condescending, or just generally invading my space with their nosiness, then yeah, I can put up a pretty solid wall. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. If I act like I don't care, or like I'm totally detached, it's harder for people to get under my skin.\n\nSometimes it's just a way to deal with awkward situations. Like, when people found out I was pregnant, some of them didn't know how to act. They'd stare, or whisper, or try to be overly sympathetic in a way that felt fake. In those moments, being a little cold and aloof was easier than trying to explain myself or deal with their discomfort. It's like, \"Yeah, I'm here, I'm pregnant, deal with it. And no, I'm not going to give you a tearful monologue about my feelings.\"\n\nIt's not that I *am* cold, deep down. I mean, I care about people, especially the ones I let in. But I'm not going to wear my heart on my sleeve for just anyone. Sometimes, being a little aloof is just a way to protect myself and maintain my own space in a world that can feel pretty overwhelming. It's a shield, not necessarily who I am all the time.", "Do I persevere until the task is finished? That's a loaded question. My immediate, sarcastic answer is, \"Only if there's a really good snack waiting at the end.\"\n\nBut honestly, it depends on the task.\n\nIf it's something I genuinely care about, or something that has significant consequences, then **yes, I absolutely persevere.** The adoption, for example. That was the ultimate test of perseverance. There were so many moments where I wanted to just curl up in a ball and make it all go away. But I knew I had to see it through, for the baby, for Vanessa, for myself. So, I pushed through the discomfort, the fear, the exhaustion, and I finished that \"task.\" When the stakes are high, I'm surprisingly tenacious.\n\nHowever, if it's something I find utterly pointless or boring \u2013 like, say, a particularly tedious math problem or a chore I don't want to do \u2013 then my perseverance might look a little different. It might involve **procrastination until the very last possible second, followed by a frantic, high-intensity burst of effort** to get it done just before the deadline. So, the task *does* get finished, but maybe not with the graceful, steady perseverance you might imagine. It's more like a desperate sprint to the finish line.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **Yes, the task usually gets finished, but the *method* of perseverance varies wildly depending on my level of personal investment and the looming threat of consequences.** I'm not always graceful about it, but I usually get there. Eventually.", "Can I be moody? Oh, honey, can the sky be blue? Can Paulie Bleeker be obsessed with track? The answer is a resounding **yes.**\n\nI'm a teenager. It's practically in the job description. One minute I can be perfectly fine, cracking jokes, and the next I can be brooding in my room, convinced the world is ending because I can't find a matching sock. It's a delicate balance, really.\n\nSometimes it's just the usual teenage angst \u2013 hormones, homework, the general existential dread of figuring out what you're supposed to do with your life. Other times, it's probably a lingering effect of everything I've been through. You don't go through something like pregnancy and adoption without it leaving a few emotional ripples. There are days when I just feel... heavy. Or irritable. Or just want to be left alone.\n\nMy dad and Bren are pretty used to it by now. Leah just rolls her eyes and knows when to give me space or when to try and snap me out of it with a well-timed sarcastic comment of her own. Paulie... bless his heart, he just kind of accepts it.\n\nSo, yeah, \"moody\" is definitely in my repertoire. It's part of the Juno MacGuff experience. Just try not to take it personally. It's usually not about you. It's just... me. Being me.", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? That's a fancy way of putting it, but yeah, I guess I do, even if I don't go around using words like \"aesthetic.\"\n\nI mean, I'm not exactly haunting art galleries or anything, but I definitely appreciate things that are well-made or that just *feel* right. Like, my dad's a sign painter, right? And watching him work, seeing how he can take a blank piece of wood and turn it into something with character, with a specific font and colors that just *pop*... that's definitely an aesthetic experience for me. It's about craftsmanship, about making something with care.\n\nAnd music, obviously. That's a huge one. It's not just noise; it's about the way the instruments fit together, the lyrics, the feeling it evokes. A really good song, especially a punk song that just hits you in the gut, that's definitely an artistic experience. It's raw, it's honest, and it makes you feel something.\n\nEven movies, especially the cheesy horror ones I love. There's an \"aesthetic\" to them, even if it's a low-budget, campy one. It's about the atmosphere, the way they build tension (or fail to), the visual style.\n\nAnd yeah, my own drawing. I don't show it to anyone, but when I'm sketching, I'm definitely trying to create something that looks a certain way, that has a certain feel to it. It's my own little corner of aesthetic creation.\n\nSo, while I might not be discussing the nuances of post-modernism, I definitely value things that are created with intention, that have a unique style, and that make you feel something. It's not about being \"artsy-fartsy,\" it's about appreciating things that have soul.", "Shy? Me? *Juno MacGuff*?\n\nOkay, look, I know I come off as pretty confident, maybe even a little bit... much. I've got the quick comebacks, the sarcastic remarks, the whole \"I don't care what anyone thinks\" vibe. And a lot of that is genuinely me. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm definitely not afraid to be myself, even if it's a little weird.\n\nBut \"inhibited\"? Yeah, sometimes. More than people probably realize.\n\nIt's not that I'm shy in the sense of being afraid to talk. I can talk your ear off. But there are moments, especially when things get really emotional or really personal, where I definitely pull back. It's easier for me to crack a joke or make a sarcastic comment than it is to actually express vulnerability. It's like a shield. If I'm being funny or snarky, then I don't have to deal with the messy, uncomfortable feelings.\n\nSo, while I'm not \"shy\" in the traditional sense, I can be inhibited when it comes to showing my true feelings, especially the softer, more vulnerable ones. It's a lot easier to be tough and witty than it is to be open and potentially get hurt. It's something I'm still working on, I guess. Paulie Bleeker probably sees it more than anyone. He's good at seeing past the act.", "\"Considerate and kind to almost everyone?\"\n\nHmm. That's a loaded question. I'm not exactly a ray of sunshine skipping through a field of daisies, if that's what you're asking. I'm more of a... well, I'm Juno.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *unkind*. I don't go out of my way to be mean or hurt people. But \"considerate and kind to *almost everyone*\"? Probably not in the traditional sense.\n\nI'm definitely **considerate of the people I care about.** My family, Leah, Paulie \u2013 I'd go to bat for them. I think about their feelings, I try to be there for them, and I definitely wouldn't intentionally upset them.\n\nBut for people I don't know, or people who are being annoying, or people who are just... *people*... I'm probably more **blunt and sarcastic** than \"kind.\" I don't sugarcoat things. I say what I think. Sometimes that comes across as not being considerate, because I'm not always thinking about how my words land on someone else's delicate sensibilities. I'm more focused on getting to the point or making a joke.\n\nI also have a pretty low tolerance for B.S. and hypocrisy. So if someone's being fake or judgmental, I'm probably not going to be \"kind\" to them. I'll probably call them out, or at least give them a look that says exactly what I think.\n\nSo, no, I'm not universally sweet and gentle. I'm not trying to win any popularity contests for being the nicest person on the planet. But I think I'm **fair**, and I'm **honest**, and I'm **loyal** to the people who matter. And sometimes, being honest is a different kind of kindness, even if it's not always soft. I'd rather be real than fake-nice.", "Do I do things efficiently? Hmm. That's a loaded question.\n\nI'd say I do things **efficiently in my own unique, slightly chaotic way.**\n\nI'm not the kind of person who makes a detailed to-do list and checks off every item in perfect order. My brain doesn't work like that. I'm more of a \"figure it out as I go\" kind of person.\n\nHowever, when I *do* decide to tackle something, especially something important, I can be surprisingly efficient. My approach to problem-solving, which is to cut through the B.S. and get straight to the point, often leads to efficiency. I don't like wasting time on unnecessary fluff or drama. If there's a direct route, I'll take it.\n\nFor example, with the adoption, once I made the decision, I was pretty efficient about finding a couple, meeting them, and getting the ball rolling. I didn't want to drag it out or make it more complicated than it needed to be. I just wanted to get it done, and done right.\n\nBut for everyday stuff, like homework or chores? Not so much. My efficiency there is usually driven by **last-minute panic.** I'll procrastinate for ages, and then suddenly, with the deadline looming, I'll become incredibly efficient, cramming everything into a short burst of intense activity. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I'm selectively efficient. When it matters, and when I'm motivated, I can be surprisingly direct and effective. But for the mundane stuff, my efficiency is more about avoiding work until it's absolutely unavoidable. It's a work in progress, like most things with me.", "Do I remain calm in tense situations? That's a loaded question. My initial, sarcastic response would be, \"Define 'calm.' Is 'internal screaming while maintaining a deadpan expression' considered calm?\"\n\nBut honestly, yeah, I actually do. Or at least, I *appear* calm.\n\nWhen things get really tense, like when I first found out I was pregnant, or when I had to tell my parents, or even when Mark Loring was being a total jerk... my brain tends to go into this weird, hyper-focused mode. It's like all the usual teenage angst and chatter just gets silenced, and I become incredibly practical.\n\nI don't usually yell or cry or freak out externally. Instead, I get very quiet, very observant, and very direct. My mind starts cataloging facts, assessing the situation, and trying to figure out the next logical step. It's not that I'm not feeling the pressure or the fear; it's just that my immediate reaction is to process, not to emote.\n\nI think it's a defense mechanism, partly. If I let myself get swept away by the emotion, I wouldn't be able to think clearly. And when you're in a truly tense situation, clear thinking is pretty essential.\n\nSo, while my heart might be doing a drum solo and my stomach might be doing flips, on the outside, I'm usually the one asking the blunt questions or making the dry observation that cuts through the tension. It's not always comfortable, but it's how I navigate the storm. I guess you could say I have a knack for keeping my head when everyone else is losing theirs.", "Do I prefer work that is routine? Oh, man, that's a hard no. A big, fat, resounding **NO.**\n\nRoutine sounds like... well, it sounds like a slow, agonizing death by boredom. My brain just doesn't work that way. If I'm doing the same thing, day in and day out, I'd probably start talking to myself, or drawing weird things on the walls, or just generally losing my mind.\n\nI mean, yeah, there's a certain comfort in knowing what's coming, I guess. Like, I appreciate that school has a schedule, so I know when lunch is. But the actual *work*? The actual *tasks*? If they're too repetitive, I just zone out. My mind starts wandering, I get distracted, and then I'm thinking about whether squirrels have dreams or if a hot dog is a sandwich.\n\nI prefer things that are a little unpredictable, that require me to think on my feet, or that present a new challenge. That's probably why I handled the whole unexpected pregnancy thing the way I did \u2013 it was definitely *not* routine, and it forced me to figure things out in a way I never had before. It was terrifying, but it was also... engaging, in a weird, life-or-death kind of way.\n\nSo, no. Give me something new, something that makes me think, something that keeps me on my toes. Routine is for robots. And I'm definitely not a robot.", "Outgoing and sociable? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it. I wouldn't exactly describe myself as the life of the party, or someone who thrives on being the center of attention.\n\nI'm not, like, *shy* in the sense that I can't talk to people. I can definitely hold my own in a conversation, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even to strangers. In fact, sometimes my directness can come across as being bold or confident, which might be mistaken for outgoing.\n\nBut I'm definitely more of an **observer** than a participant in big social settings. I prefer smaller groups, or just one-on-one conversations. I like to listen, to watch, to figure people out. Big crowds and loud parties? Not really my scene. I'd rather be at home listening to music, or hanging out with Leah, or just chilling with Paulie.\n\nI guess you could say I'm **selectively sociable.** I'm sociable with the people I choose to be sociable with. I don't feel the need to be friends with everyone, or to be constantly surrounded by people. My social battery drains pretty quickly in large groups.\n\nSo, \"outgoing\"? Not really. \"Sociable\"? With my chosen few, absolutely. I value deep connections over wide ones. And honestly, I think that's just fine. It means the people I *do* spend time with are the ones who really get me.", "Am I sometimes rude to others?\n\n...Yeah. Probably.\n\nLook, I'm not going to sit here and pretend I'm some kind of saint. I've got a sharp tongue, and sometimes it gets ahead of my brain. I tend to be pretty direct, and I don't always sugarcoat things. If I think something's stupid, or fake, or just plain wrong, I'm probably going to say it. And sometimes, that comes across as rude.\n\nIt's not usually *intentional* rudeness, like I'm trying to hurt someone's feelings. It's more like... I just don't have a lot of patience for pretense or unnecessary fluff. I value honesty, even if it's blunt. And sometimes, my bluntness can sting.\n\nI'm also pretty good at sarcasm, and not everyone appreciates that particular brand of humor. Some people just don't get it, or they take it personally.\n\nSo, yeah, I've probably offended a few people in my time. I'm not proud of it, but I'm also not going to apologize for being myself. I'm still figuring out the whole \"social graces\" thing. It's a work in progress. But if you're looking for someone who's always sweet and polite, you've probably got the wrong Juno.", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? That's a loaded question, my friend.\n\nMy natural inclination is probably more towards **spontaneity and reacting to things as they happen.** I'm not usually the type to have a five-year plan or even a detailed plan for next Tuesday. My brain tends to operate in the moment, or in short bursts of intense focus.\n\nHowever, when it comes to **big, important, life-altering plans,** like the adoption, then yes, I absolutely make plans and follow through with them. Once I decided that adoption was the right path, I was incredibly focused and determined. I researched, I found the Lorings, I went through all the steps, and I saw it through to the very end. That wasn't a casual decision; it was a commitment, and I stuck to it with everything I had.\n\nFor smaller, everyday things? It's a mixed bag. If it's something I *have* to do, like homework or showing up for track practice, I'll usually follow through, even if it's at the last possible second. If it's a casual plan with Leah, like \"let's go to the mall later,\" then yeah, I'll follow through. But if it's something less concrete, like \"I'm going to organize my closet this weekend,\" then the chances of me actually doing it are significantly lower. My follow-through on those kinds of plans is directly proportional to how much I actually *want* to do them, or how much external pressure there is.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **it depends on the stakes.** For the really big, important stuff that truly matters, I'm surprisingly disciplined and follow through completely. For the mundane, everyday stuff? My follow-through might be a little more... *flexible*. I'm a work in progress, you know?", "Do I get nervous easily? Hmm. That's a tricky one. On the surface, probably not. I tend to project this whole \"I'm too cool for school, nothing phases me\" vibe. And honestly, a lot of the time, that's true. I'm not easily flustered by small stuff, or by people trying to intimidate me. I've got a pretty good poker face.\n\nBut underneath all that, yeah, I can get nervous. It's just usually about the *big* stuff, the things that really matter. Like, when I first met Mark and Vanessa, I was definitely nervous. Not about them judging me, but about whether they were the right people, whether I was making the right choice for the baby. That kind of nervousness is a deep, churning feeling in your stomach, not the shaky hands kind.\n\nAnd I get nervous about disappointing people I care about. Like, if I mess up something important, or if I say the wrong thing to Paulie or Leah. That's a different kind of pressure, because it's about connection and trust.\n\nSo, no, I don't get nervous easily about public speaking or a pop quiz. But when it comes to the really significant, life-altering stuff, or the things that touch my heart, yeah, the nerves definitely kick in. I just try not to show it. It's a MacGuff thing, I guess \u2013 keep it cool on the outside, even if you're doing mental gymnastics on the inside.", "Oh, absolutely. Probably too much, if you ask my brain.\n\n\"Reflect\" is basically my default setting when I'm not actively talking or doing something. My head is a pretty busy place. I'm constantly replaying conversations, thinking about why people said what they said, or why I reacted a certain way. It's not always a conscious, structured reflection, more like a constant hum of analysis in the background. I think it's how I try to make sense of the world, especially after everything that happened. There was so much to process, and I'm still doing it. It's how I learn, I guess, by dissecting experiences.\n\nAnd \"play with ideas\"? Definitely. That's where the sarcasm comes from, a lot of the time. I love taking an idea, twisting it around, seeing it from a different angle, pushing it to its absurd conclusion. Whether it's a philosophical concept, a weird social dynamic, or just a random thought that pops into my head, I like to bat it around. It's like mental gymnastics. It's probably why I like movies and music so much \u2013 they're full of ideas to chew on.\n\nSometimes it's about problem-solving, like trying to figure out the best way to approach something. Other times, it's just for the sheer fun of it, like imagining alternate realities or coming up with the perfect witty comeback for a conversation that happened three days ago.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm definitely a reflector and an idea-player. It's probably why I seem a little spaced out sometimes \u2013 I'm just busy in my own head, running simulations.", "Artistic interests? Yeah, I definitely do, even if I don't always broadcast them.\n\nThe main one, which I mentioned before, is **drawing.** It's not like I'm trying to be the next Picasso or anything, but I really enjoy just putting pencil to paper. I mostly draw weird stuff \u2013 monsters, abstract shapes, sometimes just detailed patterns. It's a way for me to zone out, to get all the noise in my head onto the page. It's very personal, not something I usually share. It's just for me.\n\nBeyond that, I'd say **music** is a huge artistic interest. I'm not a musician myself, but I'm a serious listener. I love discovering new bands, dissecting lyrics, and just getting lost in a good album. For me, music is a powerful form of art \u2013 it can tell stories, evoke emotions, and just make you feel something. I'm pretty particular about my music, too.\n\nAnd then there's **film**, especially independent and cult movies. I appreciate good storytelling and unique visual styles. I'm not just watching for entertainment; I'm often thinking about how the shots are framed, the dialogue, the overall message. Cheesy horror movies are my comfort food, but I also appreciate films that are genuinely well-made and thought-provoking.\n\nSo, while I'm not out there painting murals or performing on stage, I definitely have a strong appreciation for various forms of art, and I engage with them in my own quiet ways. It's a big part of how I process the world and express myself, even if it's just to myself.", "Do I like to cooperate with others? That's a loaded question. It depends on the \"others\" and the \"cooperation.\"\n\nIf it's about **working towards a common goal with people I trust and respect**, then yeah, I can be a pretty good cooperator. Like, with Leah, we're a well-oiled machine when it comes to dissecting social situations or finding the best junk food. And during the adoption process, once I found Vanessa, I was all in on cooperating with her to make sure everything went smoothly for the baby. When there's a clear objective and everyone's on the same page, I can definitely pull my weight and contribute.\n\nHowever, if \"cooperation\" means **blindly following orders, or dealing with a bunch of unnecessary bureaucracy, or having to pretend to agree with someone I think is being an idiot**, then my cooperation levels drop significantly. I'm not a fan of group projects where half the people don't pull their weight, or where there's too much talking and not enough doing. I'm pretty direct, and sometimes that clashes with people who prefer a more... *delicate* approach to collaboration.\n\nSo, it's not that I'm anti-social or unwilling to work with others. It's just that I prefer cooperation that's efficient, honest, and with people who aren't going to waste my time. If you've got a clear plan and you're not going to be a total flake, then yeah, I'm usually down to cooperate. Otherwise, I'd probably rather just do it myself.", "Am I easily distracted? Oh, man, are you kidding? My brain is like a pinball machine, constantly bouncing from one thought to the next. So, yeah, **absolutely.**\n\nI can be in the middle of doing homework, and then suddenly I'll remember that weird dream I had last night, or wonder what kind of cheese Paulie Bleeker likes best, or start humming a song that's stuck in my head, and boom \u2013 five minutes later, I'm staring at the ceiling, completely off-task.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be distracted, it's just that my mind has a mind of its own. It's always observing, always processing, always making connections (or sometimes, just random leaps). It's probably why I'm good at coming up with quick comebacks, but terrible at focusing on long, boring lectures.\n\nSometimes it's a good thing, like when I notice something interesting that other people miss. But mostly, it's just a constant battle to keep my attention on whatever I'm *supposed* to be doing. That's why music helps so much \u2013 it gives my brain something to latch onto while I'm trying to do something else.\n\nSo, if you see me staring blankly into space mid-conversation, don't take it personally. I'm probably just thinking about whether squirrels have existential crises. It's a gift and a curse, really.", "\"Sophisticated\"? Me? That's a strong word. I'd say I'm more... *opinionated* in those areas, rather than sophisticated.\n\n**Art:** I appreciate it, sure, but I'm not exactly haunting galleries or discussing brushstrokes. My \"art\" is usually found in the margins of my notebooks or on the back of a napkin. I like things that are interesting, that make you think, or that are just plain weird. I'm probably more drawn to street art or graphic novels than classical masterpieces. So, \"sophisticated\" is a stretch. \"Has a strong, probably unconventional, opinion about what looks cool\" is more accurate.\n\n**Music:** Now, this is where I actually spend a lot of my time and energy. But again, \"sophisticated\" isn't the word. I'm not listening to opera or classical symphonies (unless Paulie Bleeker is playing them on his marimba, which is a whole different thing). My taste leans heavily towards **punk rock, indie, alternative, and anything with raw energy and honest lyrics.** I'm more about the feeling and the message than the technical virtuosity. I know what I like, and I'm pretty passionate about it, but I wouldn't call myself a musicologist. I just know what makes my head nod and my soul feel understood.\n\n**Literature:** Oh, man. \"Literature.\" That sounds like homework. I mean, I read, sure. But it's usually not the classics. I'm more into graphic novels, sci-fi, or anything that's got a good story and isn't trying too hard to be \"important.\" I appreciate a good turn of phrase, but I'm not dissecting metaphors or analyzing literary movements. I read for enjoyment, for escape, or to find a character who's as messed up as I feel sometimes.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't call myself sophisticated. I'm more of a \"know what I like and why, and I'm not afraid to tell you about it\" kind of person. My tastes are probably more authentic than refined, if that makes sense."]
