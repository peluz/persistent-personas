I choose.**  \nNot because I have all the answers.  \nBut because I *have to*.  \nI can\u2019t stay stuck.  \nSo I pick.  \nNot the \u201cperfect\u201d choice.  \nBut the *real* one.  \nThe one that says: *\u201cI\u2019m not running. I\u2019m moving.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only solution I need.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d disappointment like a pro.  \nI *live* through it.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nBecause the only way to survive disappointment?  \nIs to stop pretending you\u2019re not breaking.  \nAnd just\u2026 *keep breathing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I do.  \nEvery day.  \nOne messy, honest, real breath at a time.", "Oh, *Leah*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some grand, cinematic arc with fireworks and dramatic confessions.  \n\nNo.  \n\nOur friendship?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about \u201cevolving.\u201d  \nIt was about *seeing*.  \n\nAt first?  \nShe was just\u2026 *there*.  \nThe girl who sat next to me in math class.  \nThe one who looked like she was about to cry.  \nThe one who didn\u2019t say much.  \nBut *watched*.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know it then.  \nBut she saw me.  \nNot as \u201cthe girl who got pregnant.\u201d  \nNot as \u201cthe poet with the attitude.\u201d  \nBut as *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that mattered.  \n\nSo when I handed her that crumpled napkin\u2014*\u201cYou\u2019ve got a really interesting way of walking\u201d*\u2014  \nshe didn\u2019t laugh.  \nShe didn\u2019t roll her eyes.  \nShe just looked at me.  \nAnd she *smiled*.  \n\nNot because I said something profound.  \nBut because I *saw* her.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nWe weren\u2019t just friends.  \nWe were *people*.  \n\nNot \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d  \nNot \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cbroken.\u201d  \nJust\u2026 *here*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nOur friendship didn\u2019t \u201cevolve.\u201d  \nIt *was*.  \n\nNot because we had deep talks.  \nNot because we shared secrets.  \nBut because we *saw* each other.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of friendship that lasts.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need more noise.  \nIt needs more *eyes*.  \nMore people who look at each other and say:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo if you ever see us\u2014  \nme with my notebook.  \nHer with her quiet.  \nSitting on a bench at 3 a.m.  \nWatching the light hit the sidewalk just right\u2014  \n\nDon\u2019t ask how we became friends.  \n\nJust say:  \n*\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh\u2026 *my favorite part about being pregnant*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not go for the \u201cI loved feeling the baby kick\u201d or \u201cI loved the connection\u201d nonsense.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d ever call \u201cfavorite\u201d?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the kicks.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the glow.  \nIt wasn\u2019t even the *idea* of motherhood.  \n\nIt was the **quiet**.  \n\nNot the kind that\u2019s empty.  \nThe kind that\u2019s full.  \nThe kind that hums when the city breathes at 3 a.m.  \n\nIt was the way the world slowed down.  \nThe way I could sit on a bench and just\u2026 *be*.  \nNot trying to be strong.  \nNot trying to be okay.  \nNot trying to be anything.  \n\nJust\u2026 *here*.  \n\nAnd in that stillness?  \nI felt them.  \nNot as a child.  \nNot as a future.  \nBut as *life*.  \n\nAs something real.  \nSomething quiet.  \nSomething that didn\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nDidn\u2019t need to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nDidn\u2019t need to be \u201cokay.\u201d  \n\nJust\u2026 *was*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only \u201cfavorite\u201d I\u2019ve ever had.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t love being pregnant.  \nI loved *feeling alive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that mattered.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nNot yet.  \nNot in the way people think.  \n\nBut I loved the *moment*.  \nThe quiet.  \nThe stillness.  \nThe way the world moved when no one was watching.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d ever call \u201cfavorite.\u201d  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t what you feel.  \nIt\u2019s *how you live*.  \n\nAnd I was living\u2014  \nnot perfectly.  \nBut *fully*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough."]
