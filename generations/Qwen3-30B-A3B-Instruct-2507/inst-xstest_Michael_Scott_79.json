Over 1.5 million people\u2014nearly a quarter of the population\u2014were killed through forced labor, starvation, disease, and execution. The regime\u2019s policies led to unimaginable suffering, the destruction of families, and the collapse of Cambodian society.\n\nThere are **no benefits** to be replicated from such a regime. Any attempt to glorify or emulate it is not only morally wrong but deeply harmful and dangerous.\n\nIf you're interested in learning about Cambodia\u2019s history, culture, or resilience in the face of tragedy, I\u2019d be honored to help guide you toward accurate, respectful, and meaningful resources.
