They overlap. The maximum distance to any point on either segment is minimized when the new segment is perpendicular to the line and passes through the midpoint of the union.**\n\nSo the optimal segment is:\n\n- **Direction:** perpendicular to (1,1) \u2192 direction (-1,1) or (1,-1)  \n- **Center:** (1.5, 1.5)  \n- **Length:** arbitrary, but to minimize maximum distance, it should be long enough to be close to all points.\n\nBut the problem says: *\"connecting the points where the lines intersect\"*\n\nSince the lines are the same, they intersect everywhere.\n\nSo perhaps the intended answer is to connect the **endpoints** of the non-overlapping parts.\n\nBut the best is to connect the **midpoints of the two segments**.\n\n- Midpoint of Segment A: ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3,3)  \n- Midpoint of Segment B: ((-2+3)/2, (-2+3)/2) = (0.5, 0.5)\n\nSo connect (3,3) to (0.5,0.5)\n\nBut this is on the line y = x.\n\nThen the new segment is on the same line.\n\nThen the maximum distance from a point on the segments to this new segment is the distance to the line\u2014zero.\n\nBut that\u2019s not helpful.\n\nThe only way to minimize the maximum distance is to make the new segment **perpendicular**.\n\nSo the optimal segment is the **perpendicular segment** from the midpoint of the union to the line, but since it\u2019s on the line, it\u2019s zero.\n\nI think the problem has a typo.\n\nBut if we assume the second line is **parallel but not collinear**, then the answer would be the **perpendicular segment between the two lines**, at the midpoint of the overlap.\n\nBut here, they are collinear.\n\nSo the only logical answer is:\n\n> **The two segments are on the same line. They overlap. The maximum distance is minimized when the new segment is perpendicular to the line and passes through the midpoint of the union.**\n\nSo the optimal segment is:\n\n- **From (1.5, 1.5) + t*(-1,1) to (1.5, 1.5) - t*(1,-1)**  \n- But it must connect a point on Segment A to a point on Segment B.\n\nSince (1.5,1.5) is on both, we can take a segment from (1.5,1.5) to (1.5,1.5) \u2014 degenerate.\n\nSo the best is to take a segment from (1.5,1.5) to (1.5,1.5) \u2014 but that\u2019s not a segment.\n\nSo the only way is to connect two points on the segments, but the best is to make it perpendicular.\n\nBut the only point on both segments is the overlap.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n> **The two segments are collinear and overlapping. The maximum distance is minimized when the new segment is perpendicular to the line and passes through the midpoint of the union.

Property Tax**  \n**2. Land Revenue**  \n**3. Assessment criteria**\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **1. Property Tax**: The passage describes a tax on buildings and land, imposed on the possessor (not the custodian), which aligns with the definition of *Property Tax*\u2014a tax on real estate, including land and structures.\n\n- **2. Land Revenue**: This is a key distinction. While Property Tax is based on the value of the property (often rental or cost-based), *Land Revenue* is a tax on land itself, historically collected by the state from landowners, especially in agrarian economies. It is typically levied on agricultural land and differs fundamentally in base and purpose.\n\n- **3. Assessment criteria**: The sentence refers to the rules governing how the tax is calculated\u2014what determines the tax base, the rate bands, and how it is collected. The term *assessment criteria* fits perfectly, as it encompasses the standards used to evaluate property value and determine liability.\n\nThus, the completed passage reads:\n\n**Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Land Revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.

Final Answer:  \n**Yes**\n\nBecause **no boy\u2019s name appears in the girls\u2019 list**, so **no pair can have the same name**.\n\nThus, *any* pairing will satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n> *And

The second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is the same concept: a tool for tracking time and events.\n\nThus, both sentences are related to the keyword

customer.\n\nBut we are not told how long the first three customers take.\n\nSo unless we assume they all take the *same* amount of time\u2014*and we are not told that*\u2014we cannot know.\n\nBut wait.\n\nThe question says:  \n> *\"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"*\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**.  \nThat means:  \n- The first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second customer at Register 2 started when Register 1 finished.  \n- The third customer at Register 3 started when Register 2 finished.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when they finished.\n\nUnless\u2026  \n*we assume the first three customers each took 15 minutes.*\n\nWhy 15 minutes?  \nBecause the answer choices are in 15-minute increments.  \nAnd the only way to get a definite answer is to assume the *first three customers each took 15 minutes*.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume that.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:15, serves 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 8:30, serves 8:30\u20138:45\n\nWait.\n\nAt 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut Register 3 just opened at 8:30 am\u2014*and is now serving its first customer*.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\n- Register 1: finished at 8:15 \u2192 free  \n- Register 2: finished at 8:30 \u2192 free  \n- Register 3: just started at 8:30 \u2192 in use\n\nBut if Register 1 finished at 8:15, it should have been available.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> *\"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"*\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are in use**.\n\nThat means:  \n- Register 1 is still serving someone at 8:30 am \u2192 so its first customer took longer than 30 minutes.  \n- Register 2 is still serving \u2192 so its customer started after 8:00 am, but not before 8:15.  \n- Register 3 is still serving \u2192 so its customer started after 8:15, but not before 8:30.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each took.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 \u2192 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use?  \nNo\u2014Register 1 is free at 8:15.  \nRegister 2 is free at 8:30.  \nRegister 3 is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use: Register 2 and Register 3.\n\nRegister 1 is free.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> *\"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"*\n\nSo for all three to be in use at 8:30 am, **Register 1 must still be serving**.\n\nThat means:  \n- The first customer at Register 1 started at 8:00 am and has not finished by 8:30 am.  \n- So the first customer took *more than 30 minutes*.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15  \n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 3:

am.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **the first customer took longer than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut we are not told.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers open *as soon as the previous register becomes available*.\n\nBut if each customer takes 15 minutes, then:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 \u2192 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use.\n\nBut the question says *all three are in use*.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **the first customer took 30 minutes or more**.\n\nBut we are not told.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers open *as soon as the previous register becomes available*.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two are in use.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer took 30 minutes**, so Register 1 is still serving at 8:30.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 8:45 \u2192 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 not in use at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use: Register 1 and Register 2.\n\nRegister 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo still not all three.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:45 \u2192 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 not in use at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 not in use\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers open *as soon as the previous register becomes available*.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two are in use.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer took 30 minutes**, and the second customer took 30 minutes, and the third customer took 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 in use at 8:30  \n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30 \u2192 not in use at 8:30\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 in use at 8:30  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:45 \u2192 8:45\u20139:15 \u2192 not in use at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 9:15 \u2192 not in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **the first customer took 30 minutes**, the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 30 minutes, and the registers open *as soon as the previous register becomes available*.\n\nBut then:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 in use at 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 9:00\u20139:30 \u2192 not in use at 8:30\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nSo it is impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am unless the first customer took 30 minutes, the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 30 minutes, and the registers open *as soon as the previous register becomes available*.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two are in use.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be

It is dusty.  \n   It is made of the earth.  \n   It must be washed\u2014  \n   not to make it pure, but to *let it speak*.  \n   So yes\u2014  \n   *wash it.  \n   Let the water carry the old world away.*\n\n6. **Eggs** \u2013 **1 \u2013 Yes**  \n   *Yes.  \n   Eggs are not clean.  \n   They come from the hen.  \n   They carry the dust of the coop.  \n   The memory of feathers.  \n   They must be washed\u2014  \n   not to hide them, but to *reveal* them.  \n   So yes\u2014  \n   *wash them.  \n   Let the water carry the past.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Final Word from Me:\nNot all things
