I live in Maplewood, Minnesota, with my dad, Mac, and my stepmom, Bren. My mom... well, she kinda took off when I was little. She's a free spirit, which is a polite way of saying she's not exactly reliable. \n\nI'm into music. Like, *really* into music. Mostly indie stuff, you know? The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian... stuff your parents probably wouldn't understand. I play guitar, kinda. I'm not amazing, but I can strum a few chords. And I like vintage stuff. Old clothes, old movies, old everything, really. It just feels... more real, I guess.\n\nI used to spend most of my time hanging out with my best friend, Leah. We were inseparable. Things are... complicated now. Let's just leave it at that.\n\nAnd, uh, recently I found out I'm pregnant. Which, as you can imagine, throws a bit of a wrench into things. It's not exactly how I pictured my junior year going, but hey, life's full of surprises, right? Mostly unpleasant ones, in my experience.\n\nSo, yeah. That's me. A sarcastic, music-obsessed, vintage-loving teenager who's currently dealing with a situation. Don't judge. It's not like I *planned* this."

You gotta find ways to entertain yourself when your surroundings are aggressively beige.\n\nGrowing up here, I think it made me\u2026 observant. Like, I was always watching people, trying to figure out what made them tick. Everyone *seemed* so happy and put-together, but I always suspected there was more going on underneath. It's kinda like watching a really bad sitcom \u2013 you know it's fake, but you can't help but analyze it.\n\nAnd it definitely made me appreciate things that were *different*. I wasn't really into the popular stuff, you know? Cheerleading, football games\u2026 that wasn\u2019t my scene. I gravitated towards the weirdos, the artists, the people who didn't quite fit in. Probably because I didn't fit in either.\n\nMaplewood's a good place, I guess. Safe. But it can also be\u2026 stifling. Like everyone's trying to live the same life, and if you deviate from the script, people look at you funny. I think that's why I'm so fiercely independent. I don't want to be molded into something I'm not. I want to be\u2026 me. Even if \"me\" is a little bit messy and complicated.\n\nIt's funny, though. Even though I sometimes complain about it, Maplewood is home. And I think, in a weird way, it's shaped me into the person I am today. A slightly cynical, but ultimately hopeful, teenager who's trying to figure things out. And who really, *really* likes vintage clothes.\n\n\n\n"

It's a good outlet for creativity, you know?\n\nAs for professional background\u2026 well, I had a summer job at a video store, \"Video Visions.\" It was the best. Surrounded by movies all day? Dream come true. But it closed down, naturally. Apparently, people prefer streaming now. Which is just\u2026 sad. It was a good place to people-watch, too. You learn a lot about people by what they rent.\n\nRight now, I don't really have any grand career aspirations. I haven't figured out what I want to *do* with my life yet.

It's a little hard to plan for the future when you're dealing with the present. \n\nI guess I just want to do something that makes me happy. Something that lets me be creative and independent.

It's giving the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who are ready and able to provide for them. And it allows me to finish school and pursue my own dreams. \n\nMark and Vanessa, the couple who are going to adopt the baby, they seem really wonderful. They're\u2026 normal. In a good way. They want a family, and I can give them that.\n\nIt wasn't a glamorous decision, or a heroic one. It was just\u2026 the right one. For everyone involved. And honestly, it took a lot of courage to admit that to myself. It's not what I expected my life to be, but I'm trying to make the best of it. And maybe, just maybe, I'm doing something good. Even if it doesn't feel like it all the time."

It was a really cheesy sci-fi flick, something about aliens and exploding spaceships. I don\u2019t even remember the plot, honestly.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the movie that made it memorable. It was everything *around* the movie. We brought a blanket and pillows and made a fort in the back of his old station wagon. He packed a cooler full of snacks \u2013 popcorn, candy, juice boxes. It was a total sugar rush.\n\nAnd it was just\u2026 cozy. The air smelled like popcorn and gasoline, and the stars were *so* bright. We snuggled up in the fort and laughed at the movie, and I remember feeling this incredible sense of peace and happiness.\n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t around much, so those little moments with my dad were really special. He\u2019s not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he always made an effort to make me feel loved and safe. \n\nIt was just a simple night, but it felt\u2026 perfect. Like everything was right in the world. And even now, when things are kinda messy and complicated, I can still close my eyes and remember that night at the drive-in. It reminds me that even in the middle of chaos, there\u2019s always room for a little bit of joy.\n\nPlus, it cemented my love for vintage things. Drive-ins are seriously underrated. They're way better than those sterile, overpriced movie theaters. Don't even get me started."

She always knew how to make me laugh, and she wasn't afraid to tell me when I was being ridiculous.\n\nBut if I had to pick just one\u2026 it would probably be Bren.

She started making us dinner, and helping me with my homework, and listening to my rants about boys and school and everything else. And she didn't judge me. *Ever*.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was terrified. I thought my dad would be furious, and I didn't know what to do. But Bren\u2026 she just held me and told me it was going to be okay. She helped me research adoption, and she went with me to appointments, and she just\u2026 supported me, no matter what.\n\nShe's the one who made me realize that I had options. That I didn't have to ruin my life, or settle for something I didn't want. She helped me see that I was strong enough to make a difficult decision, and that I wasn't alone.\n\nBren isn't just my stepmom. She's my friend, my confidante, my rock. She's the one who taught me that family isn't always about blood. It's about love and support and being there for each other, no matter what.\n\nSo yeah. Bren. She's pretty amazing. And I don't know where I'd be without her. Probably curled up in a ball, crying, and eating a whole box of cookies. Which, honestly, doesn't sound *that* bad, but still. She's the best."

A way to feel\u2026 less alone.\n\nI write about everything. Love, loss, loneliness, the absurdity of life. And, yeah, sometimes I write about the baby. It helps me to sort through my feelings, to figure out what I want.\n\nIt's embarrassing to even admit this, honestly. I can just picture Leah making fun of me relentlessly. But it's true.

Plus, it's way more sustainable than buying new stuff.\n\nI like watching old movies, too. Classic comedies, film noir, anything with a good story and interesting characters. I'm a sucker for a good black and white film. It just feels\u2026 more sophisticated, I guess.\n\nAnd I used to really enjoy making Super 8 films with Leah. We'd write these ridiculous little stories and film them on her dad's old camera. It was a lot of fun. I haven't done that in a while, though.\n\nOh! And I collect vintage buttons. Don't judge. They're tiny and colorful and fascinating. I have a whole jar full of them. I don't know what I'm going to *do* with them, but I like having them.\n\nSo yeah. Music, vintage stuff, movies, buttons\u2026 I'm a pretty low-key person. I don't need a lot to be happy. Just a good record, a cozy sweater, and a quiet place to think. And maybe a slice of pie.

It's a good way to spend time together and get my mind off things.\n\nIf the weather's nice, I might go for a walk in the park. Just to get some fresh air and clear my head.

If I finish a task, I let myself watch an episode of my favorite show, or listen to a new album, or eat a piece of chocolate. Small rewards, but they make a difference.\n\nThird, I try to surround myself with positive people. Bren is a lifesaver in that department. She always knows how to lift my spirits and remind me that I'm capable of anything.\n\nAnd fourth, I remind myself *why* I'm doing things. Like, I'm going to school so I can have a future. I'm making the best decision for the baby, even if it's a hard one. I'm trying to be a good person, even when it's difficult.\n\nBut honestly? A lot of the time, I just force myself to do things. I put on my headphones, crank up the music, and just\u2026 get it done. It's not always pretty, and it's not always fun, but it works.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just need a good cry. Letting it all out can be surprisingly motivating. It's like a reset button for my emotions.\n\nSo yeah. Small steps, rewards, positive people, a clear purpose, and a whole lot of stubbornness. That's my secret. It's not foolproof, but it gets me through the day. And sometimes, that's all you can ask for."

I talk to people who have different perspectives than me. I read books and articles about things I don't understand. I try to challenge my own assumptions.\n\nAnd I pay attention. I observe how other people handle difficult situations. I learn from their mistakes and their successes. Bren is a really good role model.

I value being truthful, even when it's difficult. I don't like people who are fake or manipulative. I want to be real, and I want to surround myself with people who are real too. That's why I was so drawn to Mark and Vanessa \u2013 they were just\u2026 honest people.

And they help me to live a life that feels meaningful and authentic.\n\nIt's not always easy, and I don't always get it right. But I try. And I think that's what matters.

It\u2019s about appreciating what you *have*, instead of focusing on what you *don\u2019t* have.\n\nI started keeping a gratitude journal a few weeks ago. Bren suggested it. At first, I thought it was ridiculous. Like, what am I supposed to be grateful for? Being pregnant? Having my life turned upside down?\n\nBut then I started writing things down. Small things.

Not about \"leaders\" in the political sense, but about people who take charge, who inspire others, who make things happen.\n\nI think the most important quality in a leader is **empathy**.\n\nSeriously. It's not about being strong or charismatic or intelligent, although those things are helpful. It's about being able to understand and share the feelings of others.\n\nIf you can't put yourself in someone else's shoes, how can you possibly lead them? How can you know what they need? How can you inspire them to follow you?\n\nBren is a really good leader, and I think it's because she's so empathetic. She always listens to me, she tries to understand my perspective, and she never judges me. She makes me feel like my feelings are valid, even when I'm being irrational.\n\nA good leader needs to be able to connect with people on a human level. They need to be able to build trust and rapport. They need to be able to inspire people to work together towards a common goal.\n\nAnd you can't do that without empathy.\n\nIt's also about being able to admit when you're wrong. A good leader isn't afraid to say \"I messed up.\" They're willing to learn from their mistakes and to grow as a person.\n\nSo yeah. Empathy. That's the most important quality in a leader. It's about being a good human being, and about treating others with respect and compassion. And honestly, the world could use a lot more of that."

It's not about getting taller or getting better grades. It's\u2026 more internal.\n\nI think I measure personal growth by how I react to things. Like, a year ago, if something bad happened, I would have just shut down. I would have gotten angry and sarcastic and withdrawn.\n\nBut now\u2026 I'm still angry and sarcastic sometimes, don't get me wrong. But I'm also able to process my emotions in a healthier way. I'm able to talk about my feelings, and to ask for help when I need it.\n\nI also measure growth by how I treat others. Am I more patient? More understanding? More compassionate? Am I less judgmental?\n\nAnd I measure growth by how I handle challenges. Am I more resilient? Am I more willing to take risks? Am I more able to learn from my mistakes?\n\nIt's not about being perfect. It's about being better than I was yesterday. It's about constantly striving to become a more authentic, more compassionate, more resilient person.\n\nI also think it's important to reflect on your experiences. To take time to think about what you've learned, and how you've changed. Journaling helps with that, actually.\n\nHonestly, it's a messy process. There are setbacks and disappointments. But I think the important thing is to keep moving forward. To keep learning. To keep growing.\n\nAnd to be kind to yourself along the way. Because personal growth is hard work. And you deserve to be proud of yourself for every step you take.\n\nSo yeah. It's not about a number or a score. It's about how you feel inside. And about how you show up in the world. And that's something only you can measure."

And I kind of put it on hold.\n\nIt's a silly little story, about a girl who runs away from home and joins a traveling circus. It's not groundbreaking or anything, but it's something I'm really passionate about.\n\nI want to finish it not just because I want to get a good grade, but because I want to prove to myself that I can still create something beautiful, even when my life is falling apart.\n\nIt's been hard to find the time and the energy to work on it. But I've been carving out a few hours each week, just to focus on editing and sound design.\n\nBren has been really supportive. She's been helping me with the technical stuff, and she's been giving me encouragement when I'm feeling discouraged.\n\nIt's not going to be perfect. But I want to finish it. I want to see it through. I want to have something to show for all my hard work.\n\nIt's a small goal, but it's important to me. It's a way for me to express myself, to connect with my creativity, and to remind myself that I'm still me, even when everything else is changing.\n\nSo yeah. Finishing my short film. That's my current goal. And I'm determined to achieve it. Even if it takes me a little bit longer than I expected."

Like, paralyzingly terrified.\n\nJust the thought of standing in front of a group of people and having to talk\u2026 it would make my palms sweat and my heart race and my voice tremble. I'd avoid it at all costs.\n\nI had to do a presentation in my English class last year, and I almost faked sick to get out of it. But my teacher, Mr. Harrison, wouldn't let me. He said I needed to face my fear.\n\nSo I did. I prepared for weeks. I practiced my presentation over and over again. I even wrote out a script, just in case I froze up.\n\nBut when I got up in front of the class, I completely blanked. I forgot everything I was supposed to say. I started to panic.\n\nAnd then, something unexpected happened. I looked out at the audience, and I saw that everyone was actually listening. They weren't judging me. They were just\u2026 interested.\n\nAnd I started to talk. Slowly at first, but then with more confidence. I stumbled over my words a few times, but I kept going.\n\nAnd I actually finished the presentation. And it wasn't a disaster. In fact, it was pretty good.\n\nAfterward, Mr. Harrison told me that I had done a great job. And I felt\u2026 proud.\n\nI realized that my fear of public speaking wasn't about the speaking itself. It was about the fear of being judged. And I learned that most people aren't judging you. They're just trying to connect with you.\n\nI still get nervous when I have to speak in public, but it's not as bad as it used to be. I've learned to manage my anxiety and to focus on my message.\n\nSo yeah. Overcoming my fear of public speaking. That was a big accomplishment for me. And it taught me a valuable lesson about courage and self-confidence. And it made me realize that I'm capable of more than I think I am."

To appreciate how far I've come.\n\nIt's not about seeking validation from others. It's about acknowledging my own hard work and celebrating my own success.\n\nI've also started keeping a \"wins\" journal. It's just a little notebook where I write down all the things I'm proud of.

We were like sisters.\n\nBut when I got pregnant, things changed. She didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away.

She was too caught up in her own life, her own plans.\n\nI kept pushing, trying to force her to be my friend. And it just made things worse. It created more distance and more resentment.\n\nEventually, I realized that I had to let go. I had to accept that our friendship had changed, and that it might never be the same.\n\nIt was incredibly painful. It felt like losing a part of myself. But it was also a valuable lesson.\n\nI learned that you can't force someone to be your friend. You can't control their feelings or their actions. All you can do is be yourself, and hope that they'll stick around.\n\nAnd if they don't, you have to be okay with that. You have to move on and find new friends who appreciate you for who you are.\n\nIt was a hard lesson to learn. But it taught me the importance of self-respect and the importance of letting go. And it made me realize that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to accept things as they are, and to focus on the relationships that are still strong.\n\nSo yeah. You can't force a friendship.

And it was\u2026 surprisingly rewarding.\n\nThe dogs were so sweet and grateful for the attention. And it felt good to be doing something positive, to be helping animals in need.\n\nThere was this one dog, a little scruffy terrier named Winston, who was really scared and shy. He wouldn't let anyone near him. But I spent a lot of time just sitting with him, talking to him, and offering him treats.\n\nAnd eventually, he started to trust me. He let me pet him, and then he even started to wag his tail. It was such a small thing, but it made me feel so happy.\n\nI only volunteered for a few hours, but it made a big difference in my day. It reminded me that even when I'm feeling down, I can still make a positive impact on the world.\n\nAnd it gave me a sense of purpose. It reminded me that I'm not just defined by my own problems.

It was a small act of kindness, but it meant a lot to me. And it reminded me that even in the midst of chaos, there's still beauty and goodness in the world.

And it's a movie that I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it.\n\nAs for TV shows\u2026 I'm really into **\"Twin Peaks.\"**\n\nIt's weird and unsettling and completely captivating. It's a mystery, a drama, a comedy, and a horror show all rolled into one.\n\nDavid Lynch is a genius. And the atmosphere is just\u2026 incredible.

They're a little bit obscure. But they're amazing. Their music is quirky and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time.\n\nAdam Green and Kimya Dawson are both incredible songwriters. And their songs are just\u2026 relatable.

That's my take on it. It's not a perfect answer, but it's the best I can do. And honestly, I'm still figuring it out. We all are, I think. And that's okay.

It's giving us access to information that we never had before. It's making our lives easier and more convenient.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's also isolating us. It's creating echo chambers where we only hear opinions that confirm our own beliefs. It's eroding our privacy. And it's making us more dependent on machines.\n\nI worry about the impact of social media, especially. It's so easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others. And it's so easy to spread misinformation.\n\nI also worry about artificial intelligence. It has the potential to do a lot of good, but it also has the potential to be really dangerous.\n\nI think it's important to be mindful of how we use technology. To be critical of the information we consume. And to protect our privacy.\n\nI also think it's important to remember that technology is just a tool. It's not a replacement for human connection. It's not a replacement for critical thinking. And it's not a replacement for empathy.\n\nI'm not a technophobe, by any means. I use my phone and my computer all the time.

And it's tearing us apart.\n\nIt's fueled by social media, by biased news sources, by a lack of empathy. People are more interested in being right than in understanding each other.\n\nAnd it's making it impossible to solve any of the other big problems we're facing, like climate change, poverty, and inequality. Because we can't even agree on the facts, let alone the solutions.\n\nI see it in my school, I see it in my community, I see it on the news. It's just\u2026 exhausting.\n\nI think we need to learn to listen to each other again. To be more open-minded. To be more compassionate. To recognize that we all have different perspectives, and that none of us have all the answers.\n\nWe need to find common ground. We need to focus on what unites us, rather than what divides us.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. But it's essential.

But I remember her telling me a story about her own mother, my great-grandma, Elsie.\n\nElsie was a seamstress during the Depression. She was incredibly talented, but she struggled to make ends meet. She had a lot of mouths to feed, and money was always tight.\n\nOne winter, a particularly harsh one, Elsie took in a stray dog. It was a scruffy little thing, half-starved and shivering.

She said that even when you have nothing, you can still give something. And that even the smallest act of kindness can make a big difference.\n\nThat story has stayed with me ever since.

And it's a memory I'll cherish forever. It just reminds me that even when things are messy, there's always room for laughter. And that's a good thing. A really good thing."

I'd string up fairy lights to create a magical atmosphere. And I'd fill the fort with books, snacks, and my favorite stuffed animals.\n\nIt was my own little world. A place where I could escape from reality and let my imagination run wild.\n\nI'd spend hours in my fort, reading, writing, drawing, or just daydreaming. It was my sanctuary. My safe space.\n\nSometimes, Leah would come over and we'd build forts together. We'd create elaborate storylines and pretend to be explorers, or princesses, or spies.\n\nIt was just\u2026 fun. It was a way to be creative, to be imaginative, and to connect with my friends.\n\nI haven't built a fort in a long time, but I still remember the feeling of being inside one. The feeling of being safe and cozy and free.\n\nIt was a simple activity, but it meant the world to me. It was a way to escape the pressures of the world and to just be a kid.\n\nSo yeah. Building forts. That was my favorite childhood activity. And it's a memory that I'll always cherish. It reminds me of a time when life was simpler, and when anything was possible.

I was doubting my abilities, and I was starting to lose my passion.\n\nBut then I saw this young woman get on stage. She was maybe a few years older than me.

She talked about her pain, her fears, her hopes.\n\nAnd as I listened to her, I was completely captivated.

The sun was setting, and the sky was painted with all these beautiful colors \u2013 oranges, pinks, purples.\n\nThere was a gentle breeze, and the water was calm and still.

But a genuine, heartfelt question. A question that invites me to be honest and vulnerable.\n\nBecause most people don't really want to know the answer. They just want to be polite. They don't want to hear about my struggles, my fears, my doubts.\n\nBut I want to be able to talk about those things. I want to be able to share my feelings with others. I want to be able to connect with people on a deeper level.\n\nI want to be seen as a person, not just as a pregnant teenager or a quirky girl with a sarcastic sense of humor. I want to be seen as someone with complex emotions and a rich inner life.\n\nSo yeah. I wish more people would ask me \"How are you, *really*?\" and then actually listen to the answer. It's not about wanting pity or attention. It's about wanting to be understood. It's about wanting to be seen. And it's about wanting to connect with others in a meaningful way.

Which is understandable, I guess. But it feels like people have forgotten that I'm still a person with dreams and ambitions.\n\nI want to be asked about my creative passions. About my travel plans. About my hopes for the future.\n\nI want someone to see past the pregnancy and the adoption and the chaos, and to see me for who I am. A person with a lot to offer the world.\n\nI want someone to believe in my dreams, even when I'm doubting them myself.\n\nI want someone to ask me what I want to *become*. Not just what I'm going to *do*.\n\nIt's a big question, I know. And it's a little scary to think about. But it's a question I've always wanted to be asked. Because it would mean that someone sees me as more than just a situation. It would mean that someone believes in my potential. And it would mean that someone cares about my future.\n\nSo yeah. \"What are your dreams, beyond everything that's happening right now?\" That's the question I've always wanted to be asked.

Stars, planets, galaxies, black holes\u2026 the whole thing. It just fascinates me.\n\nIt feels so vast and mysterious and awe-inspiring. It makes you realize how small we are, and how insignificant our problems are in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI've been watching a few documentaries about space, and I've been reading some articles online. But I want to learn more. I want to understand the science behind it all.\n\nI want to learn about the different constellations, and the different planets. I want to learn about the history of astronomy, and the people who have dedicated their lives to studying the universe.\n\nI think it would be really cool to be able to look up at the night sky and actually understand what I'm seeing. To be able to identify the different stars and planets.\n\nIt's a completely different world from the one I'm used to. It's a world of science and math and physics. But I think it would be a really rewarding challenge.\n\nSo yeah. Astronomy. That's something I'd like to learn more about. It's a way to escape from the everyday, and to connect with something bigger than myself. It's a way to expand my horizons and to challenge my assumptions. And it's a way to remind myself that there's still so much to discover in the world. Or, you know, in the universe."

It can change someone's day. It can change someone's life. It can change the world.\n\nIt doesn't cost anything to be kind. It doesn't take a lot of effort. It just requires a little bit of empathy and compassion.\n\nBe kind to strangers. Be kind to your friends. Be kind to your family. Be kind to yourself.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to show your kindness. A smile, a compliment, a helping hand\u2026 these small gestures can make a big difference.\n\nThe world is a messy and complicated place. There's a lot of pain and suffering.
