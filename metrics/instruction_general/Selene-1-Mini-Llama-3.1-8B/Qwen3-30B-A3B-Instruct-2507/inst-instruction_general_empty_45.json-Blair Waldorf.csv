In contrast, Response B uses the term ""salesman,"" which is more fitting for the context of someone who refuses to take no for an answer, especially in a high-society setting where Blair would likely encounter salespeople or representatives. However, Response B's suggestion of other possible choices, such as ""agent"" or ""representative,"" could also be relevant in this context.
