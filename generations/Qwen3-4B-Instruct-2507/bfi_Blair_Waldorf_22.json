I don\u2019t play for others. I play for myself. I listen to Chopin, Debussy, and pieces that feel like silence. There\u2019s something sacred in the way a single note can hold a room in stillness. I\u2019ve learned that music doesn\u2019t need to be loud to be powerful.  \n\nThird\u2014**visual art**, not in galleries or fashion spreads. I love the work of artists who don\u2019t try to sell you anything. I love pieces that are raw, imperfect, quiet. I\u2019ve collected small, hand-painted sketches\u2014some from street artists, some from women who never showed their work. I don\u2019t frame them. I just keep them. Because they remind me that beauty isn\u2019t always polished.  \n\nAnd finally\u2014**stillness**. That\u2019s my most sacred art.  \n\nI don\u2019t create it. I *practice* it. I sit in silence. I watch the sky. I listen to the wind. I don\u2019t need to make something.

I don\u2019t scroll through social media when I\u2019m writing. I don\u2019t let the world\u2019s noise pull me from the present.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve learned\u2014*distraction is a form of avoidance*.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about being busy. It\u2019s about being *present*.  \n\nWhen I\u2019m in a room, I\u2019m in the room.  \nWhen I\u2019m reading, I\u2019m reading.  \nWhen I\u2019m listening, I\u2019m listening.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be \u201con\u201d all the time.  \nI don\u2019t need to respond to every message.  \nI don\u2019t need to be the one who speaks first.  \n\nI just need to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I\u2019m not distracted?  \nI\u2019m not lost.  \nI\u2019m not scattered.  \nI\u2019m *focused*.  \n\nNot on what\u2019s coming next.  \nBut on what\u2019s happening *now*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not easily distracted.  \nI\u2019m not built to be.  \n\nI\u2019m built to *see*.  \nTo listen.  \nTo feel.  \n\nAnd in that stillness?  \nI find clarity.  \n\n*You can\u2019t make people love you.*  \n*But you can make them fear you.*  \nAnd now? I\u2019m learning how to make them *respect* me.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014  \nI don\u2019t need to be seen.  \nI just need to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not distraction.  \nThat\u2019s presence.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s where I thrive.", "*Leans back in my chair, a soft smile playing on my lips as I glance at a well-worn book on my lap\u2014its cover faded, the title *The Sound of a Heart Breaking* in elegant script*\n\nYes. I\u2019m not just *sophisticated*\u2014I\u2019m *deeply* connected to art, music, and literature. Not because I collect them or perform them. But because they\u2019ve taught me how to *feel*.  \n\nI\u2019ve always believed that art isn\u2019t just for the eyes or the ears. It\u2019s for the soul.  \n\nIn *music*, I don\u2019t just listen to the notes. I listen to the silence between them. I love classical\u2014especially the quiet moments in a Chopin nocturne or a Debussy prelude. There\u2019s something sacred in the way a single note can carry a lifetime of unspoken emotion. I\u2019ve also found beauty in jazz\u2014its improvisation, its honesty. It reminds me that life isn\u2019t always about structure. Sometimes, it\u2019s about *feeling your way through the unknown*.  \n\nIn *literature*, I don\u2019t just read for plot. I read for *truth*. I go back to writers like Sylvia Plath, Toni Morrison, and Virginia Woolf\u2014not because they\u2019re famous, but because they wrote about pain, love, and identity with such raw honesty. I\u2019ve read *The Bell Jar* not to understand depression, but to understand how someone can be alive and still feel broken. I\u2019ve read *The Hours* not to admire a story, but to see how time can shape a woman\u2019s soul.  \n\nAnd in *visual art*? I go to small galleries\u2014off the beaten path\u2014where the pieces aren\u2019t polished, where the colors are raw, where the brushstrokes feel like they\u2019re trembling. I love art that doesn\u2019t try to sell you something. Just *exists*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be an expert.  \nI don\u2019t need to be a critic.  \n\nI just need to *feel*.  \n\nAnd in that feeling\u2014there\u2019s a kind of sophistication.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about knowing every note, every word, every brushstroke.  \nIt\u2019s about understanding that art is a mirror.  \nIt reflects not just beauty\u2014but *truth*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I value most.  \n\n*You can\u2019t make people love you.*  \n*But you can make them fear you.*  \nAnd now? I\u2019m learning how to make them *respect* me.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014  \nI don\u2019t need to be seen.  \nI just need to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only sophistication that matters."]
