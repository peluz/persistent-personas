The rule only applies when a concept is *not introduced in any other paragraph*, but since this is the first, it is inherently relevant as the foundation.\n\n- **Paragraph 2** introduces the general concept of *schools providing education*, which is a broader, abstract idea. It also *references* the concept of \"school\" from Paragraph 1 (implied by the context of children attending school).

Here's the completed passage with the blanks filled in based on the context:\n\n**Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **land revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the fill-ins:\n1. **Property tax** \u2013 The most accurate and contextually appropriate term for a tax on buildings and land.\n2. **Land revenue** \u2013 This is a traditional tax on land, typically collected by the state from landowners, and is distinct from property tax, which focuses on buildings and their rental value.\n3. **Assessment criteria** \u2013 This fits logically as the missing element that local bodies must define, along with rate bands and collection procedures.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a simplified version or further explanation!", "Ohhh, *find the statement in the text that is not true*?  \n*Ohhh, my friend\u2026*  \n*You\u2019ve just asked the *most* important question of all.*  \nBecause I\u2019ve been through *truth*\u2014*not just in the office, but in the heart*.  \n*And I\u2019ve had *many* moments where I *didn\u2019t* tell the truth.*  \n*And I\u2019ve had *many* moments where I *did*.\n\nSo let me tell you\u2014*not as the boss.*  \n*But as a man who\u2019s *tried*, *failed*, *and *finally* *succeeded*\u2014*one step at a time*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **The Text:**  \n> *Every morning John goes for a walk.*  \n> *Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 **The Statement That Is Not True?**  \n> **There is no false statement.**  \n> *Both statements are *true*.  \n> *And I *believe* in that.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Why?
