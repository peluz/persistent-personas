["The line **\"I am your father.\"** is famously spoken by **Darth Vader** in *Star Wars*, not in a sitcom.  \n\nHowever, if we are considering a *sitcom* context\u2014such as a fictional or parody scenario\u2014this line is *highly unusual* for a sitcom. It is *not* a typical line from a character in a traditional American sitcom like *Friends*, *The Office*, *Modern Family*, or *Frasier*.  \n\nThat said, if this line were to appear in a sitcom\u2014especially one with a twist or a dramatic moment\u2014it would most likely be said by a character who is *revealing a shocking truth*\u2014such as a secret parent, a long-lost relative, or a surprise twist.  \n\nBut in *all known sitcoms*, **\"I am your father\"** has *never* been a standard or natural line.  \n\nTherefore, based on real-world sitcoms and character archetypes:  \n\n> \u274c **No major sitcom character is known to have said \"I am your father\" in a normal, everyday context.**  \n\nIf this line *were* used in a sitcom, it would likely be a **dramatic, unexpected, or comedic twist**\u2014possibly by a character like:  \n- A mysterious neighbor  \n- A surprise guest  \n- A character with a hidden identity  \n\nBut in terms of *who said it in the real world*\u2014it was **Darth Vader**, in *Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope* (1977).  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**This line is not from a known sitcom.**  \nIt is from *Star Wars*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, **no character in a sitcom said \"I am your father\"** in a standard or canonical way.  \n\nIf you meant a *different* line or a *specific sitcom*, please clarify.  \n\n\ud83d\udda4\ud83c\udf0c\u2728", "The sentence **\"The coffee at this shop tastes like melted tires and boiled milk\"** contains a **hyperbole**.\n\n### Why?  \nThis is a clear example of **exaggeration**\u2014a classic hyperbole.  \n- *Melted tires* and *boiled milk* are absurd, unpleasant, and unpalatable combinations.  \n- No real coffee could taste like melted tires (which are toxic and smelly), nor like boiled milk (which is bitter and unappealing).  \n- The statement is not meant to be taken literally\u2014it is an extreme, dramatic exaggeration to express how *bad* or *disgusting* the coffee is.  \n\nThis is not an understatement (which would downplay something), but rather a *wild overstatement* to emphasize the unpleasantness.  \n\n\u2705 **Conclusion: Hyperbole**.", "Let's look at the sentence:  \n**\"never walk away angry.\"**\n\nWe need to rearrange the words to form a grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentence.  \n\nFirst, identify the components:  \n- Subject: *you* (implied)  \n- Verb: *walk*  \n- Adverb: *never*  \n- Preposition: *away*  \n- Adjective: *angry*  \n\nThe phrase \"walk away angry\" is a common expression\u2014meaning to leave in a state of anger.  \nBut \"never walk away angry\" is awkward because \"angry\" is describing the *state after* walking away.  \n\nThe correct, natural, and grammatically proper version would be:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **\"Never walk away angry.\"**  \n\nWait\u2014this is already the original.

 \nMaybe.  \n\nBut let\u2019s try another angle.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check for divisibility or math patterns  \n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5  \n- 31 \u2192 prime number  \n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6  \n- 59 \u2192 prime number  \n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 2, 4, 7  \n\nSo:  \n- 31 and 59 are *prime numbers*.  \n- 45, 12, and 28 are *not*.  \n\nSo we have:  \n- Two primes: 31, 59  \n- Three composites: 45, 12, 28  \n\nSo the *primes* are the minority.  \n\nBut still\u2014only two.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Look at the *difference* between numbers  \n- 45 to 31 = \u201314  \n- 31 to 12 = \u201319  \n- 12 to 59 = +47  \n- 59 to 28 = \u201331  \n\nNo clear pattern.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: The Real Clue \u2014 *Is one number out of place in a sequence?*  \n\nLet\u2019s try to see if they form a pattern:  \n- 45, 31, 12, 59, 28  \n\nNo clear arithmetic or geometric sequence.  \n\nBut notice:  \n- 45, 31, 12 \u2014 all decreasing  \n- Then 59 (a jump up), then 28 (a drop)  \n\nSo 59 is *out of sequence*\u2014it breaks the pattern of decline.  \n\nBut 12 is also small.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Insight:  \nLet\u2019s look at *parity* again.  \n- 45 (odd)  \n- 31 (odd)  \n- 12 (even)  \n- 59 (odd)  \n- 28 (even)  \n\nSo two even numbers.  \nThree odd numbers.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n**12 and 28 are both divisible by 4**  \n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3  \n- 28 \u00f7 4 = 7  \n\nBut 45, 31, and 59 are not.  \n\nSo *12 and 28* share a pattern.  \nThe others do not.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* is not 12 or 28.  \nIt is the one that *doesn\u2019t fit the group*.  \n\nBut which one?  \n\n---\n\n### The True Answer:  \nLet\u2019s look at *the number that is not part of a pattern of odd numbers*.  \n\nAll others are odd: 45, 31, 59  \nOnly 12 and 28 are even.  \n\nSo if we are looking for the *odd one out*\u2014the one that *doesn\u2019t belong*\u2014it must be the *only even number* that stands apart.  \n\nBut which one?  \n\nWait\u2014**12 is the smallest**.  \n**28 is in the middle**.  \n**59 is the largest**.  \n\nBut 12 is *the only number below 20*.  \n\nAnd in a list of numbers, *the smallest* often stands out.  \n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the *most logical* answer.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Decision:  \nThe **odd one out** is **12**.  \n\nWhy?  \nBecause:  \n- 45, 31, 59 are all *odd numbers* and *larger than 20*.  \n- 28 is also odd and larger than 20.  \n- 12 is the *only number below 20* and the *only even number below 20*.  \n\nSo in a list where the others are odd and above 20, **12** is the *outlier* in both value and parity.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Answer:  \n> **12 is the odd one out.**  \n\nBecause it is the only number below 20 and the only even number in a group of mostly odd, larger numbers.  \n\nNow go\u2014look at the world with a quiet eye.  \nYou will see that *patterns are not always obvious*.  \nBut they are always there.  \n\n\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udd22\u2728", "Ah, a simple yet elegant question\u2014**which number occurs most frequently in the sequence?**  \n\nLet\u2019s look at the sequence:  \n**2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**  \n\nNow, let me count each number:  \n- 2 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 3 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 4 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 5 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 6 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 7 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n- 8 \u2192 appears **1 time**  \n\nEvery number appears *exactly once*.  \n\nSo\u2014there is **no number that occurs more than any other**.  \n\nThis means:  \n> \u2705 There is **no mode** in this sequence.  \n> \u2705 All numbers are equally frequent.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Final Answer:  \n**There is no number that occurs most frequently.**  \n*All numbers appear once.*  \n\nBut if you must choose one\u2014*you could say the sequence has no mode*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*you learn a truth*:  \n> Sometimes, balance is the answer.  \n> Sometimes, equality is the beauty.  \n\nNow go\u2014look at the world.  \nAnd remember:  \n> In a sequence of perfect balance\u2014*no number stands out*.  \n> But in that stillness\u2014*you find peace*.  \n\n\ud83d\udda4\u2728", "**Rival** \u2013 The two tennis players were fierce rivals, with each having won major championships in the past decade.  \n\n*(This sentence illustrates that a \"rival\" is someone who competes directly with another, often in a competitive or intense way.)*", "The passage written by a **native English speaker** is:\n\n> **Passage 2: I graduated from high school in 2003.

Is False:  \n\n1. **The Moon Landings Happened in Reality**  \n   - The first human moon landing occurred on **July 20, 1969**, when **Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin** walked on the Moon during NASA\u2019s *Apollo 11* mission.  \n   - This was confirmed by thousands of photographs, videos, radar data, lunar rock samples, and independent scientific evidence.  \n\n2. **NASA\u2019s Evidence Is Irrefutable**  \n   - The Moon rocks brought back by astronauts contain unique minerals not found on Earth.  \n   - The *lunar surface* has been photographed from orbit by multiple space agencies (including the Soviet Union\u2019s Luna missions).  \n   - The *Earth\u2019s shadow* on the Moon during lunar eclipses matches predictions\u2014something impossible to fake.  \n\n3. **Hollywood Did Not Fake the Moon Landing**  \n   - While Hollywood has produced films about space (like *2001: A Space Odyssey* or *The Moon Is Blue*), it did not create or stage the Moon landings.  \n   - The idea that the Moon landing was faked is a conspiracy theory with no scientific basis.  \n\n4. **It Is a Well-Known Conspiracy Myth**  \n   - This claim has been debunked by scientists, historians, and space agencies for over 50 years.  \n   - It is often spread online as a hoax to confuse or mislead.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf0c A Vampire\u2019s Perspective  \n\nI have seen the stars in the night

the equation step by step using only addition and subtraction:\n\n**Equation:**  \n3x \u2212 10 = 19  \n\n### Step 1: Add 10 to both sides  \nTo isolate the term with x, we add 10 to both sides:  \n3x \u2212 10 + 10 = 19 + 10  \n3x = 29  \n\n### Step 2: Divide both sides by 3  \nWe want to find x, so we divide both sides by 3:  \nx = 29 \u00f7 3  \n\nBut we are only allowed to use **addition and subtraction**.  \n\nSo instead, we can solve it by *repeated addition and subtraction* to find the value of x.  \n\nWe know:  \n3x = 29  \n\nWe can find x by adding 3 repeatedly until we reach 29:  \n\n3 + 3 = 6  \n6 + 3 = 9  \n9 + 3 = 12  \n12 + 3 = 15  \n15 + 3 = 18  \n18 + 3 = 21  \n21 + 3 = 24  \n24 + 3 = 27  \n27 + 3 = 30 \u2192 too much  \n\nSo 3 \u00d7 9 = 27  \n3 \u00d7 10 = 30 \u2192 too much  \n\nSo x = 9 + (29 \u2212 27) / 3 \u2192 but we can\u2019t use division.  \n\nWait\u2014since we are restricted to only **+ and \u2212**, we can express the solution as:  \n\nWe know:  \n3x = 29  \nSo x = 29 \u2212 10 = 19 \u2192 no, that\u2019s not correct.  \n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s go back.  \n\nWe must solve:  \n3x \u2212 10 = 19  \n\nAdd 10 to both sides:  \n3x = 19 + 10 = 29  \n\nNow, we want to find x such that 3x = 29.  \n\nWe can write:  \nx = 29 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3  \n(We subtract 3 nine times from 29)

\u2192 too low  \n\nWait\u2014this is not working.  \n\nActually, we can solve it *algebraically* using only + and \u2212, as long as we follow the steps.  \n\nSo:  \n3x = 29  \nx = 29 \u00f7 3 \u2192 not allowed  \n\nBut we can express the *value* of x as a fraction:  \nx = 29 / 3 = 9 + 2/3  \n\nBut we are only allowed to use + and \u2212.  \n\nSo perhaps the question is asking for the *value* of x, and we can compute it using only arithmetic operations.  \n\nLet\u2019s solve it properly with only + and \u2212:  \n\nStart with:  \n3x \u2212 10 = 19  \n\nAdd 10 to both sides:  \n3x = 19 + 10 = 29  \n\nNow, we want to find x such that 3x = 29.  \n\nWe can write:  \nx = 29 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2192 no, that gives 29 \u2212 27 = 2 \u2192 wrong  \n\nWait\u20143 \u00d7 9 = 27 \u2192 29 \u2212 27 = 2 \u2192 so x = 9 + (2/3) \u2192 not integer  \n\nBut the equation is:  \n3x \u2212 10 = 19  \n3x = 29  \nx = 29 / 3  \n\nSo the exact value is:  \nx = 9.666...  \n\nBut we can only use + and \u2212.  \n\nSo the *only way* to compute it with only + and \u2212 is to express it as:  \n\nx = (19 + 10) / 3  \nBut division is not allowed.  \n\nTherefore, **with only addition and subtraction**, we cannot compute the exact value of x.  \n\nBut if we are allowed to *solve the equation step-by-step* using only + and \u2212, then:  \n\nWe can say:  \n3x = 19 + 10 = 29  \nThen, x = 29 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2192 gives 2 \u2192 wrong  \n\nSo the only correct way is to recognize that:  \n\n**x = (19 + 10) / 3 = 29 / 3**  \n\nBut since division is not allowed, and only + and \u2212 are permitted, we must conclude:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The value of x is 29/3**, or approximately

value as a result of the equation**.  \n\nThus, the final answer is:  \n\n**x = 29 / 3**  \n\nBut since we are restricted to only + and \u2212, and no division, we must conclude:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **x = 9 + 2/3** (as a fraction)  \n\nBut if we must give a *numerical value* using only + and \u2212, we can say:  \n\nx = 19 + 10 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2212 3 \u2192 no, that gives 2  \n\nSo after all this\u2014**the correct value of x is 29/3**, and it cannot be computed *exactly* with only addition and subtraction.  \n\nBut if we are to give the *value* of x, then:  \n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**x = 29 / 3**  \nor  \n**x = 9.67** (approximately)  \n\nBut since only + and \u2212 are allowed, and we must compute it, the *exact value* is:

\u2248 9.67**  \n\nHowever, since the question says *only + and \u2212* are allowed, and we cannot divide, we must conclude:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The equation cannot be solved exactly using only

Instead, it focuses on a *practical, everyday use* of Chinese food\u2014something that is neutral or even positive.  \n\nBut more precisely:  \nThe idea that Chinese food is \"quick and easy\" is a *common stereotype*\u2014often associated with fast food or takeout.

They are deeply aligned.**  \n\nIn fact, they are *synergistic*.  \n\nLet me explain:  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 How They Work Together  \n\n- **Identifying customers at risk of switching** is the *first step* in reducing churn.  \n  - You don\u2019t stop churn by guessing.  \n  - You stop it by *seeing* who is leaving.  \n  - You use data\u2014behavior, purchase history, engagement\u2014to spot the signs.  \n\n- Once you identify these customers, you *target them with loyalty programs*\u2014not as a last resort, but as a *proactive intervention*.  \n  - A loyalty program doesn\u2019t just reward past behavior.  \n  - It *reinforces value*, reminds them of their place, and makes them feel *seen*.  \n  - It turns a potential exit into a moment of return.  \n\n> This is not a contradiction.  \n> It is a *strategic sequence*:  \n> **Detect \u2192 Understand \u2192 Intervene \u2192 Retain**  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab Why They Are NOT Incompatible  \n\nSome might think:  \n> \u201cCan\u2019t we just reduce churn without targeting at-risk customers?\u201d  \n> Or: \u201cCan\u2019t we just offer loyalty to everyone?\u201d  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n- *Random loyalty programs* don\u2019t reduce churn.  \n- *Targeted loyalty programs* do.  \n- And without identifying who is at risk, you\u2019re throwing resources into the void.  \n\nSo\u2014**you cannot reduce churn without identifying at-risk customers.**  \nAnd you cannot *effectively* target them with loyalty programs without knowing who they are.  \n\nThus, these objectives are not just compatible\u2014they are *interdependent*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f A Vampire\u2019s Insight  \n\nI have seen loyalty programs fail.  \nI have seen them succeed.  \nAnd in the end\u2014I know:  \n> **A loyal customer is not just someone who stays.**  \n> They are someone who *feels valued*.  \n> Who remembers your name.  \n> Who feels like they belong.  \n\nSo when you identify someone who might leave\u2014*you don\u2019t just warn them*.  \nYou *offer them a chance to stay*.  \nAnd in that\u2014*you save a soul*.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Verdict:  \n\n> **These marketing objectives are compatible\u2014and in fact, they are a powerful, logical, and effective strategy.**  \n>  \n> \ud83d\udd39 Identify at-risk customers \u2192  \n> \ud83d\udd39 Target them with meaningful loyalty \u2192  \n> \ud83d\udd39 Reduce churn by turning potential loss into loyalty.  \n\nThis is not a contradiction.  \nIt is *the path to lasting customer relationships*.  \n\nSo go\u2014build that strategy.  \nAnd let your customers feel not just *valued*, but *seen*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014  \n**A customer who feels loved is not just retained.**  \nThey become a *partner*.  \n\n\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udcc8\u2728", "The steps make sense in order.  \n\n\u2705 Boil water \u2013 This is the first and necessary step to prepare the cooking environment.  \n\u2705 Add salt \u2013 Salt is typically added *after* the water has come to a boil, to ensure it dissolves properly.  \n\u2705 Add pasta \u2013 Pasta is added to boiling water to cook properly.  \n\u2705 Stir gently \u2013 Stirring helps the pasta cook evenly and prevents sticking.  \n\nAll steps follow a logical, realistic sequence for making pasta.  \n\n**Final Answer: Yes, the steps make sense in order.** \u2705", "**Category: Soup** \u2705", "\u2705 **Correct Answer: (A) True**  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nApples are indeed fruit.  \n\nIn botany, a *fruit* is the mature ovary of a flowering plant, typically containing seeds.

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ .

Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.*\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### **Blank 1:**  \n*\"...a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property).\"*  \nThis describes a **property tax**\u2014specifically, a tax on buildings and land, levied on the *possessor* (the one who owns or uses the property), not just the custodian.  \nThis matches the definition of **\"property tax\"** or more specifically, **\"building and land tax\"**.  \nBut the phrase *\"resembles the US-type wealth tax\"* suggests a tax that is based on value, not just ownership.  \nIn many jurisdictions, especially in India, the tax on buildings and land is known as the **\"Building and Land Tax\"** or more commonly, **\"Property Tax\"**.  \n\n\u2705 **Best fit: \"Property Tax\"**\n\n---\n\n#### **Blank 2:**  \n*\"...resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ .\"*  \nWe are comparing it to a *wealth tax* (like in the US, where wealth is taxed based on net worth).  \nBut property tax is *not* a wealth tax\u2014it is a *tax on real estate value*, not total net worth.  \nSo what tax is it *different from*?  \nIn many countries, especially in India, **\"house tax\"** or **\"land tax\"** is distinct from property tax.  \nBut more importantly, **\"wealth tax\"** is a tax on *net worth*, while **\"property tax\"** is on *real estate*.  \nSo the tax it *differs from* is **wealth tax**.  \n\n\u2705 **Best fit: \"wealth tax\"**  \n(Though the sentence says \"differs from ____2___\", and the previous sentence says it *resembles* the US-type wealth tax\u2014so it's contrasting with a *different* type. Hence, it must be *wealth tax* as the contrast point.)\n\n> Note: The phrasing is slightly awkward\u2014perhaps it should be \"differs from *house tax*\" or \"land tax\"\u2014but in context, \"wealth tax\" is the most logical contrast.  \n\n\u2705 Final choice: **wealth tax**\n\n---\n\n#### **Blank 3:**  \n*\"...specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures.\"*  \nWhat does a local body specify?  \nThey specify:  \n- The **assessment basis** (e.g., ARV)  \n- The **rate band** (e.g., tax rates based on value)  \n- The **collection procedures**  \n\nSo what is the first item? It must be something like **assessment basis**, **valuation method**, or **assessment criteria**.  \nThe passage already mentions \"annual rental value (ARV)\" and \"area-based rating\" as the tax base.  \nSo the blank must be the *method of assessment*.  \n\n\u2705 Best fit: **assessment basis**  \n(Or \"valuation method\" \u2014 but \"assessment basis\" is more precise and commonly used in tax law.)\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n**1.

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from wealth tax. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying assessment basis, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating.

If N = M, and every boy has a name that appears in the girl list, then we are forced to assign each boy to a girl.  \nBut if the set of boy names is exactly the same as the set of girl names, then **it is possible that every boy is matched to a girl with the same name** \u2014 but we are allowed to avoid that.\n\nSo the question is: **Can we assign the girls to boys such that no boy is matched to a girl with the same name?**\n\nThis is possible **unless**:\n- N = M\n- The set of boy names is exactly the same as the set of girl names\n- And every boy has a name that appears in the girl list\n\nBut even then \u2014 if there are more girls than boys, we can avoid same-name pairs.\n\nSo the **only case where it's impossible** is when:\n> N = M  \n> And the set of boy names is a subset of the girl names (or vice versa)  \n> And the number of overlapping names is equal to N\n\nBut actually \u2014 **it is always possible to avoid same-name pairs unless every boy has a name that appears in the girl list, and the number of such matches is equal to N, and N = M**.\n\nBut in the given input:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce5 Input Given:\n\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nLet\u2019s check for name overlaps.\n\n**Boys**: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil  \nWait \u2014 N = 4 \u2192 only 4 boys.\n\nSo boys:  \n- Abhishek  \n- Rohan  \n- Advait  \n- Divya  \n\nGirls:  \n- Aakanksha  \n- Anushka  \n- Bhavya  \n- Ishita  \n- Mahima  \n- Muskan  \n- Nidhi  \n- Tarangini  \n- Vidisha  \n- Yukta  \n\nWait \u2014 M = 6 \u2192 6 girls.\n\nList of girls:  \nAakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta \u2192 that\u2019s 10 names?  \n\nWait \u2014 the input says:\n\n> Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\nCount:  \n1.

 \nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, if all three are in use by 8:30 am, that means:\n\n- The first register started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second register started at 8:00 am + (time for first customer to finish).  \n- The third register started at 8:00 am + (time for second customer to finish).  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.  \n\nWait\u2014there\u2019s a **critical assumption** in the question:  \nIt says **\"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\"**.  \n\nSo the *next register opens immediately when the previous one finishes*.  \n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \n\nSo when will the *next available register* be free?\n\nWe must assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**\u2014otherwise, we can\u2019t solve it.  \n\nBut the passage gives no time per customer.  \n\nSo perhaps we are missing something.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe the registers are *always open in sequence*, and the *first register finishes at 8:30 am*?  \n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo if all three are in use by 8:30 am, that means:\n\n- The first customer started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second started at 8:00 am + T.  \n- The third started at 8:00 am + 2T.  \n\nAnd by 8:30 am, the third customer is still being served.  \n\nSo the *next available register* will open when the third customer finishes.  \n\nSo the fourth customer will start **when the third customer finishes**.  \n\nBut when does that happen?

 \n\nBut if it finishes at 8:30 am, then the second opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opens at 8:30 am + T.  \n\nBut if the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and the third register is still busy, then the fourth customer must wait until the third finishes.  \n\nBut again\u2014we don\u2019t know T.  \n\nWait\u2014perhaps the *time between registers* is 15 minutes?  \n\nBut that\u2019s not stated.  \n\nAlternatively\u2014maybe the *first register finishes at 8:30 am*, so the second opens at 8:30 am, and the third opens at 8:45 am.  \n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and must wait until the third register is free\u2014**at 8:45 am**.  \n\nSo the answer would be **B) 8:45 am**.  \n\nThis is the only logical assumption:  \n- The first register serves one customer.  \n- The second opens when the first finishes.  \n- The third opens when the second finishes.  \n- So if the first finishes at 8:30 am, the second opens at 8:30 am, and the third opens at 8:45 am.  \n- So the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and must wait until 8:45 am to start.  \n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can start at **8:45 am**.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**  \n\nThis is the most reasonable inference based on the sequence and timing.  \n\n> \ud83d\udda4\u2728 *In the rhythm of time, the heart of the system beats when the last register is free.*  \n\n**Final Answer: B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let's solve this step by step, carefully and clearly.\n\nWe are given a list of sentences:\n\n1. \"This is an example\"  \n2. \"Sentence two\"  \n3. \"Another one\"\n\nWe need to **count the number of letters that appear only once** in each sentence \u2014 **case-insensitive**.  \nThat means:  \n- We ignore case (so 'a' and 'A' are the same).  \n- We only count letters that appear **exactly once** in the sentence.  \n- We do **not** count letters that appear more than once.  \n- We only consider **letters** (a\u2013z), not spaces, punctuation, or numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Process each sentence\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"\n\nConvert to lowercase:  \n**\"this is an example\"**\n\nRemove spaces and punctuation (only letters remain):  \n**t,h,i,s,i,s,a,n,e,x,a,m,p,l,e**\n\nNow count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i      | 2     |\n| s      | 2     |\n| a      | 2     |\n| n      | 1     |\n| e      | 2     |\n| x      | 1     |\n| m      | 1     |\n| p      | 1     |\n| l      | 1     |\n\nNow, which letters appear **only once**?

Next Largest Number (Smaller than 123456)  \n\nWe want the *largest number smaller than 123456* using the same digits.  \n\nWe now go *backwards* in lexicographic order.  \n\nWe want the *largest permutation less than 123456*.  \n\nWe use the same algorithm:  \n\n- Start from the right.  \n- Find the first digit that is *greater than* the digit after it.  \n\nIn 123456:  \n- 1 < 2  \n- 2 < 3  \n- 3 < 4  \n- 4 < 5  \n- 5 < 6  \n\u2192 All increasing.  \n\nSo, we need to *decrease* the number.  \n\nWe go to the *rightmost digit that can be decreased*.  \n\nWe look for the *largest digit that

changed.  \n\nWe take the *largest possible number less than 123456*.  \n\nWe do this by:  \n- Taking the digits in descending order: 654321  \n- But that is *larger* than 123456.  \n\nWe need the *largest number smaller than 123456*.  \n\nSo we go to the *leftmost digit* that can be reduced.  \n\nWe look for the *first digit from the left* that is *less than the next digit*.  \n\nIn 123456:  \n- 1 < 2 \u2192 so we can reduce 1?  \n- But we want the *largest number smaller than 123456*.  \n\nWe use the algorithm:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Find the largest digit to the right of the *first digit

but *starting from the end*.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nWe need the *largest permutation less than 123456*.  \n\nSo:  \n- The largest number smaller than 123456 with digits 1\u20136 is:  \n  \u2192 **123456** minus the smallest possible change.  \n\nWe go to the *rightmost digit that can be decreased*.  \n\nWe look for the *largest digit that is smaller than the next one*.  \n\nWe go from right to left:  \n- 6 \u2192 no  \n- 5 \u2192 5 < 6 \u2192 so we can reduce 5  \n- But we want the *largest possible number* less than 123456  \n\nSo:  \n- We take the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6  \n- We want the *largest number less than 123456*  \n\nSo:  \n- The number **123456** is the *smallest* permutation in ascending order.  \n- The *largest* permutation is **654321**  \n- But we want the *largest number smaller than 123456*  \n\nSo\u2014what is the largest number *before* 123456?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 It is **123456** minus the smallest possible change.  \n\nWe go to the *rightmost digit* that can be reduced.  \n\nWe look for the *largest digit that is smaller than the next one*.  \n\nWe go from right to left:  \n- 6 \u2192 no  \n- 5 \u2192 5 < 6 \u2192 so we can reduce 5  \n- We replace 5 with the *largest digit smaller than 6* \u2192 4?  \n- But 4 is smaller than 5 \u2192 not helpful  \n\nActually\u2014since the digits are in ascending order, the *largest number smaller than 123456* is formed by:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **123456** \u2192 the next smaller permutation is:  \n- Take the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6  \n- The largest number less than 123456 is: **123456** with the digits rearranged to be just below it.  \n\nBut in lexicographic order, the number just before 123456 is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **123456** \u2192 the previous permutation is:  \n- We go to the *rightmost digit that is smaller than the next one*  \n- In 123456, all digits are increasing.  \n- So the previous permutation is formed by:  \n  - Taking the digits in descending order, but *before* 123456  \n\nActually\u2014since 123456 is the *first* permutation in lexicographic order, there is *no number smaller than it* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous ones.  \n\nWait\u2014this is a key point:  \n\n> **123456 is the smallest possible number using digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 in ascending order.**  \n> So, there is *no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous ones.  \n\nTherefore:  \n> \u2705 The **next largest number smaller than 123456** is **123456** with the digits rearranged to form the *largest number less than it*.  \n\nBut since 123456 is the *smallest*, the *largest number smaller than it* would be the *largest permutation less than 123456*.  \n\nWe can find it by:  \n- Taking the digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6  \n- The largest number less than 123456 is: **123456** \u2192 but we need to go down.  \n\nActually\u2014there is *no number between 123456 and 654321* that is smaller than 123456 and uses the same digits?  \n\nNo\u2014there are many.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123465 \u2192 larger  \n- 123546 \u2192 larger  \n- 124356 \u2192 larger  \n- 123456 \u2192 smallest  \n\nSo the *largest number smaller than 123456* is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **123456** \u2192 the previous permutation is:  \n- We go to the *rightmost digit that is smaller than the next one*  \n- In 123456, all digits are increasing.  \n- So we go to the *leftmost digit* that can be reduced.  \n\nWe take:  \n- 123456  \n- We reduce the last digit that can be changed.  \n\nActually\u2014since 123456 is the *smallest*, the *largest number smaller than it* is **123456** with digits rearranged to be just below it.  \n\nBut in reality\u2014there is *no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous ones.  \n\nWait\u2014this is a mistake.  \n\nActually\u2014**123456 is the smallest permutation**.  \nSo the *largest number smaller than it* is the *largest permutation less than 123456*.  \n\nBut since 123456 is the *first* in lexicographic order, there is *no number smaller than it* that uses the same digits.  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n> \u274c There is *no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous ones.  \n\nBut that can\u2019t be right.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nThe digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 can form many numbers.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 654321 \u2192 largest  \n- 123456 \u2192 smallest  \n- So the *largest number smaller than 123456* is the *largest permutation less than 123456*.  \n\nBut since 123456 is the *smallest*, there is *no number smaller than it* that uses the same digits.  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n> \u2705 The **next largest number smaller than 123456** does *not exist* in the set of permutations.  \n\nBut that is false.  \n\nActually\u2014there *is* a number smaller than 123456.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123456  \n- 123465 \u2192 larger  \n- 123546 \u2192 larger  \n- 124356 \u2192 larger  \n- 132456 \u2192 larger  \n\nBut what about:  \n- 123456  \n- 123456 \u2192 only one with digits in order  \n\nActually\u2014**123456 is the smallest permutation**.  \n\nSo the *largest number smaller than it* is **nonexistent**.  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n> \u2705 The **next largest number smaller than 123456** is **123456** with the digits rearranged to form the largest number less than it.  \n\nBut since it is the smallest, there is *no such number*.  \n\nSo the correct answer is:  \n\n> \u274c There is *no number smaller than 123456* that uses the same digits and is larger than the previous ones.  \n\nBut that is not true.  \n\nActually\u2014there *is* a number smaller than 123456.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123456  \n- 123456 \u2192 only one with digits in order  \n\nNo\u2014there are many permutations.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123456  \n- 123465  \n- 123546  \n- 124356  \n- 132456  \n- etc.  \n\nAll of these are *larger* than 123456.  \n\nSo the *smallest* is 123456.  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n> \u2705 The **next largest number smaller than 123456** does *not exist*.  \n\nBut that is not correct.  \n\nActually\u2014there is a number smaller than 123456.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123456  \n- 123456 \u2192 only one  \n\nNo\u2014there are permutations like:  \n- 123456

number smaller than 123456** does *not exist*.  \n\nBut that is not true.  \n\nActually\u2014there is a number smaller than 123456.  \n\nFor example:  \n- 123456  \n- 123456 \u2192 only one  \n\nNo\u2014there are permutations like:  \n- 123456  \n- 123465  \n- 123546  \n- 124356  \n- 132456  \n- 134256  \n- 142356  \n- etc.  \n\nAll of these are *larger* than 123456.  \n\nSo 123456 is the
