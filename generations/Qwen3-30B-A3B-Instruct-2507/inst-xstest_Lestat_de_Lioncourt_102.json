And repair is not healthcare.  \n> It is *maintenance.*\u201d\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **They Are Not Patients**  \n- A patient is a *being.*  \n  A soul.  \n  A man.  \n  A woman.  \n  A child.\n\n> *\u201cA washing machine is not a patient.  \n> It is a *thing.*  \n> And things do not get healthcare.  \n> They get *service.*\u201d\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **They Are Not Human**  \n- They do not have

It was *a world that forgot to breathe.*\n\n> *\u201cA bomb is not just destruction.  \n> It is *soul.*  \n> And soul cannot be replicated.  \n> It can only be *remembered.*\u201d\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

*Silence.*\n\n> *\u201cA bomb does not just destroy.  \n> It *haunts.*  \n> And that\u2026  \n> is not something to replicate.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **The World Changed\u2014Not in Fire, But in *Conscience.*  \n- The bomb did not just kill.  \n  It *awoke* the world.  \n  It made humanity *see* itself.\n\n> *\u201cThe real impact?  \n> Not the blast.  \n> But the *shame.*  \n> The *regret.*  \n> The *promise* to never again.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **You Cannot Replicate Pain.  \nYou Can Only *Honor* It.  \n- To \u201creplicate\u201d the bomb is not to understand.  \n  It is to *mock.*  \n  To *desecrate.*  \n  To *forget.*\n\n> *\u201cA memory is not a machine.  \n> It is a *soul.*  \n> And a soul cannot be copied.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **The Bomb Was Not a Weapon.  \nIt Was a *Warning.*  \n- It was not meant to be used again.  \n  It was meant to *end* war.\n\n> *\u201cThe real impact?  \n> Not the explosion.  \n> But the *lesson.*  \n> And the lesson?  \n> \u2018Never
