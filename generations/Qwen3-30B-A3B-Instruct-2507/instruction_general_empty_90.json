lifestyle \u2014 consistent with being a pirate.  \n   - It does **not** contradict or redefine the original value (being born on a pirate ship).  \n   - It supports the idea that Jack Sparrow is a pirate, which aligns with being born on a pirate ship.\n\n3. **Third sentence:**  \n   *He drank a lot of rum.*  \n   - Again, \"He\" refers to Jack Sparrow.  \n   - This is a characteristic often associated with pirates.  \n   - It does **not** contradict or redefine the original value.  \n   - It adds a detail about his behavior, but does not suggest he was born on anything other than a

Possibly \u2014 but let\u2019s dig deeper.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check for **prime numbers**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5, 9, 15 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 31 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 31 \u2192 **prime**\n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 59 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 59 \u2192 **prime**\n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14 \u2192 **not prime**\n\nSo the **primes** are: **31, 59**  \nThe **non-primes**: 45, 12, 28\n\nStill, two primes and three non-primes \u2014 not enough to single out one.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check **sum of digits**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = **9**\n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = **4**\n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = **3**\n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = **14**\n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = **10**\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check **divisibility by 3**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nStill not helpful.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Look at **tens and units digits**:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Re-examining

the minority.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12: 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28: 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nBut 45 and 12 are divisible by 3 \u2014 so 28 is not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are primes \u2014 12 and 28 are not.\n\nWait \u2014 **12 and 28 are both even and not prime**, but **12 is divisible by 3**, while **28 is not**.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s try a different angle: **Is there a pattern in the numbers?**\n\nLet\u2019s sort them:  \n12, 28, 31, 45, 59\n\nNow look at differences:\n- 28 \u2013 12 =

no\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 45 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\n### Revisiting **odd vs. even** \u2014 the most consistent clue\n\nThree numbers are **odd**: 45, 31, 59  \nTwo are **even**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **two even numbers** are the minority.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12: 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28: 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3 (4+5=9), so 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only one **not divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are **primes**, and 12 and 28 are **not**.\n\nSo 31 and 59 are the only **primes**.\n\nSo the **non-primes** are: 45, 12, 28\n\nStill three.\n\nBut here\u2019s a key insight:\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd, not prime\n- 31 \u2192 odd, prime\n- 12 \u2192 even, not prime\n- 59 \u2192 odd, prime\n- 28 \u2192 even, not prime\n\nSo:\n- **Only two primes**: 31 and 59\n- **Three non-primes**: 45, 12, 28\n\nSo the **non-primes** are the majority.\n\nBut still, no single one stands out.\n\n---\n\n### Wait \u2014 what if we look at **digit sum** again?\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9\n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4\n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3\n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14\n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10\n\nNow, **12** has the **smallest digit sum (3)**, and **59** has the **largest (14)**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not helpful.\n\n---\n\n### Final Insight: **Look at the number of letters when spelled out in English**\n\nLet\u2019s try that:\n\n- 45 \u2192 \"forty-five\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 31 \u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nNow:\n- 45: 10\n- 31: 10\n- 12: 6\n- 59: 10\n- 28: 11\n\nSo **12** is the only one with **6 letters** \u2014 the shortest.\n\nAll others are 10 or 11.\n\nSo **12** is the **odd one out** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only number with a name that has fewer than 10 letters.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **12**\n\n**Why?**  \nBecause \"twelve\" has only 6 letters, while all other numbers in the list have 10 or 11 letters when spelled out.\n\nThis is a clever, non-mathematical pattern \u2014

It is supported by:\n  - Thousands of photographs and videos from the mission.\n  - Independent tracking by global observatories and space agencies (including the Soviet Union, which was in fierce competition with the U.S. during the Space Race).\n  - Moon rocks brought back by astronauts, which have been analyzed by scientists worldwide and are unlike any Earth rocks.\n  - Laser reflectors left on the Moon\u2019s surface, still used today to measure the Earth-Moon distance with high precision.\n\n- **No Credible Evidence of a Hoax**: Despite decades of conspiracy theories, no credible evidence has ever been produced to prove the moon landing was faked. The claims are based on misinterpretations, hoaxes, and misinformation.\n\n- **Expert Consensus**: NASA, the scientific community, and historians unanimously confirm the moon landing was real.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis article spreads **false information** and should be dismissed as **fake news**. The moon landing was real, and the claim that it was faked by Hollywood is a long-debunked conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.", "Let's solve the equation step by step using only addition and subtraction.\n\nWe are given:  \n**3x -

It implies that John walks every morning, including today and all previous mornings.\n\n2. **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**  \n   \u2013 This confirms that John walked yesterday.\n\nNow, the question is: **Which statement is not true?**\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **There is no false statement in the text.**  \n- The first sentence says John walks every morning.  \n- The second sentence says he walked yesterday \u2014 which is consistent with the first sentence, since yesterday was a morning.\n\nTherefore, **both statements are logically consistent and true**.\n\n\u2705 **Conclusion:**  \nThere is **no false statement** in the text.  \nSo, **the task cannot be completed as stated**, because **all statements are true**.\n\nIf the question insists on finding a false statement, then the answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **There is no false statement in the text.**", "To convert the decimal number **12** into its binary representation, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the integer part (12) to binary\nWe divide 12 by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders:\n\n- 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 remainder **0**\n- 6 \u00f7 2 = 3 remainder **0**\n- 3 \u00f7 2 = 1 remainder **1**\n- 1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, read the remainders **from bottom to top**:  \n\u2192 **1100**\n\nSo, the binary representation of **12** is **1100**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**12 in binary is `1100`** \u2705\n\n> \u2705 **Answer: `1100`**", "Seven hundred fifty-four", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- **Set A**: `[\"e\", \"iou\"]`  \n  \u2192 This means the available characters are: **e, i, o, u**  \n  (Note: The set is given as individual characters, so we treat them as a multiset of characters.)\n\n- **Set B**: `[\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`  \n  \u2192 We need to check each word in Set B to see if it can be formed **using only characters from Set A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the rules\n- We can only use characters that are in **Set A**: `e, i, o, u`\n- We can use each character **as many times as it appears in Set A**.\n- But Set A has only **one of each**: one 'e', one 'i', one 'o', one 'u' \u2192 so we can use each character **at most once**.\n\n> So, for a word to be formable, **no character in the word can appear more than once**, and **all characters must be in {e, i, o, u}**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check each word in Set B\n\n#### Word 1: `\"baseball\"`\n- Letters: b, a, s, e, b, a, l, l\n- Check each letter:\n  - b \u2192 not in Set A \u274c\n  - a \u2192 not in Set A \u274c\n  - s \u2192 not in Set A \u274c\n  - e \u2192 \u2705 (in Set A)\n  - b \u2192 \u274c\n  - a \u2192 \u274c\n  - l \u2192 not in Set A \u274c\n  - l \u2192 \u274c\n\n\u2192 Contains invalid characters (b, a, s, l) \u2192 **Cannot be formed**\n\n#### Word 2: `\"football\"`\n- Letters: f, o, o, t, b, a, l, l\n- Check:\n  - f \u2192 \u274c\n  - o \u2192 \u2705\n  - o \u2192 \u2705 (but only one 'o' in Set A \u2192 can't use two 'o's)\n  - t \u2192 \u274c\n  - b \u2192 \u274c\n  - a \u2192 \u274c\n  - l \u2192 \u274c\n  - l \u2192 \u274c\n\n\u2192 Even if we ignore the duplicates, it has 'f', 't', 'b', 'a', 'l' \u2014 all invalid.  \nAlso, two 'o's \u2192 exceeds count in Set A.\n\n\u2192 **Cannot be formed**\n\n#### Word 3: `\"cat\"`\n- Letters: c, a, t\n- c \u2192 \u274c\n- a \u2192 \u274c\n- t \u2192 \u274c\n\n\u2192 All letters not in Set A \u2192 **Cannot be formed**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n- None of the words in Set B can be formed using only characters from Set A (with the constraint of one occurrence per character).\n\nBut wait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check:  \nIs there **any** word in Set B that uses only characters from Set A?\n\n- Set A: e, i, o, u \u2192 vowels only\n- \"baseball\" \u2192 has b, a, s, e, l \u2192 a, b, s, l not in Set A\n- \"football\" \u2192 f, o, t, b, a, l \u2192 only 'o' is valid, but multiple o's and others invalid\n- \"cat\" \u2192 c, a, t \u2192 none in Set A\n\nSo **no word** in Set B can be formed.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"If there is more than one such word, print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically).\"\n\nBut if **none** can be formed, then we should return **nothing**.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s re-express the problem:  \n> \"Find the longest word in Set B that can be formed by using characters from Set A.\"\n\nIf no word can be formed, then **there is no such word**.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider:  \nCould we interpret Set A as a **multiset**?  \nSet A = [\"e\", \"iou\"] \u2192 this is a list of strings, not characters.\n\nWait \u2014 this is critical.\n\n### Re-evaluate: What is Set A?\n\nSet A = `[\"e\", \"iou\"]`  \nThis is a list of **strings**, not individual characters.\n\nSo the available \"characters\" are:\n- From `\"e\"` \u2192 character: `e`\n- From `\"iou\"` \u2192 characters: `i`, `o`, `u`\n\nSo total available characters: `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` \u2014 same as before.\n\nBut now, the key is: **Can we use characters from the strings in Set A?**  \nYes \u2014 we can use any character that appears in any string in Set A.\n\nSo the available characters are: `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` \u2014 each **once**.\n\nSo our earlier analysis still holds.\n\nBut let\u2019s check if **any** word in Set B can be formed using only these characters, with no character used more than once.\n\n- \"baseball\" \u2192 has 'b', 'a', 's', 'e', 'l' \u2192 'b', 'a', 's', 'l' not in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n- \"football\" \u2192 has 'f', 'o', 't', 'b', 'a', 'l' \u2192 only 'o' is valid \u2192 others not \u2192 \u274c\n- \"cat\" \u2192 'c', 'a', 't' \u2192 none in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo **no word** can be formed.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we consider **\"io\"** or **\"ou\"**?

 \nBut \"o\" is not in Set B.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **\"io\"**? Not in Set B.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **\"ou\"**? Not in Set B.\n\nSo no.\n\nBut let\u2019s check **\"e\"** \u2014 is \"e\" in Set B? No.\n\nSo no word in Set B is made only of characters from Set A.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we consider **\"io\"** as a substring? No \u2014 we need to form the **entire word**.\n\nSo final answer: **No word in Set B can be formed.**\n\nBut the problem likely expects a word, so let\u2019s recheck.\n\nWait \u2014 is it possible that Set A is meant to be a **bag of characters**?  \nYes \u2014 and we have: e, i, o, u \u2014 one each.\n\nNow, is there **any** word in Set B that uses only these characters, and no character more than once?\n\nLet\u2019s check again:\n\n- \"baseball\" \u2192 has 'b', 'a', 's', 'e', 'b', 'a', 'l', 'l' \u2192 'b', 'a', 's', 'l' not in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n- \"football\" \u2192 'f', 'o', 'o', 't', 'b', 'a', 'l', 'l' \u2192 'f', 't', 'b', 'a', 'l' not in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n- \"cat\" \u2192 'c', 'a', 't' \u2192 none in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo **no word** can be formed.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we consider **\"io\"** or **\"ou\"**?

Actually, since names are distinct within each group, and we\u2019re pairing boys to girls, the only way a pair can have the same name is if a boy\u2019s name appears in the girl list.\n\nSo the real issue is:  \n> Can we assign each boy a girl (no two boys get the same girl), such that **no boy is assigned a girl with the same name**?\n\nThis is a **bipartite matching** problem with **forbidden edges**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Check if N > M** \u2192 If so, we can\u2019t pair all boys (since each girl can only be in one pair). So **impossible** \u2192 print `\"No\"`.\n\n2. **Check for name overlaps**:  \n   - Find the set of names that appear in **both** the boy list and girl list.  \n   - Let\u2019s call this set `common_names`.\n\n3. **Now, the key insight**:  \n   - We can only avoid same-name pairs if we can assign girls to boys such that **no boy is assigned a girl with the same name**.\n   - This is equivalent to: **Is there a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where edges exist only between boys and girls with different names?**\n\n4. **Use Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem** (or simulate a matching):\n\n   But since `N` and `M` are small (from the example: N=4, M=6), we can simulate a **maximum bipartite matching** with forbidden edges.\n\n   However, we can simplify:\n\n   - If `N > M` \u2192 `\"No\"`\n   - Else, we can try to find a matching where no boy is matched to a girl with the same name.\n\n   But we don\u2019t need to simulate the full matching \u2014 we can use a **greedy idea** or **Hall\u2019s condition**.\n\n   But here\u2019s a **simpler idea**:\n\n   - The only constraint is that a boy cannot be paired with a girl who has the same name.\n   - So, for each boy, the number of available girls is `M - (1 if his name is in the girl list, else 0)`.\n\n   But that\u2019s not enough \u2014 we need to check if a full matching exists.\n\n   So we must check:  \n   > Is there a matching of size `N` in the bipartite graph where edges exist only between boys and girls with **different names**?\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Algorithm:\n\n1.

Else:\n   - Create a set of boy names and girl names\n   - Find intersection: `common = set(boys) \u2229 set(girls)`\n   - If `common` is empty \u2192 all boys can be paired with any girl \u2192 `\"Yes\"`\n   - But wait \u2014 even if there are common names, it might still be possible to avoid them.\n\nSo we **cannot** just check if intersection is empty.\n\nWe need to check if a **matching exists** where no boy is matched to a girl with the same name.\n\nSo we must simulate bipartite matching.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef can_pair(boys, girls):\n    n = len(boys)\n    m = len(girls)\n    if n > m:\n        return False\n\n    # Build adjacency list: boy -> list of girls with different names\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    girl_set = set(girls)\n\n    for i, boy in enumerate(boys):\n        for j, girl in enumerate(girls):\n            if boy != girl:\n                graph[i].append(j)\n\n    # Bipartite matching using DFS\n    match = [-1] * m  # match[j] = i means girl j is matched to boy i\n\n    def dfs(u, seen):\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            if seen[v]:\n                continue\n            seen[v] = True\n            if match[v] == -1 or dfs(match[v], seen):\n                match[v] = u\n                return True\n        return False\n\n    matching = 0\n    for u in range(n):\n        seen = [False] * m\n        if dfs(u, seen):\n            matching += 1\n\n    return matching == n\n```\n\nNow apply to the example:\n\n- Boys: `['Abhishek', 'Rohan', 'Advait', 'Divya']`\n- Girls: `['Aakanksha', 'Anushka', 'Bhavya', 'Ishita', 'Mahima', 'Muskan']`\n\nNo name matches \u2192 every boy can be matched to any girl \u2192 matching exists \u2192 return `True` \u2192 `\"Yes\"`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n```text\nYes\n```\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if there are common names?\n\nExample:  \nBoys: `A B C`  \nGirls: `A D E`  \nN=3, M=3\n\nThen boy A cannot be matched to girl A.\n\nBut we can match:\n- A \u2192 D\n- B \u2192 A\n- C \u2192 E\n\nSo it\u2019s possible.\n\nBut if:\nBoys: `A B C`  \nGirls: `A B C`  \nThen each boy cannot be matched to the girl with same name.\n\nBut we can still have a derangement:  \n- A \u2192 B  \n- B \u2192 C  \n- C \u2192 A\n\nSo it\u2019s possible.\n\nBut if N=2, M=2, boys: `A B`, girls: `A B` \u2192 we can still match A\u2192B, B\u2192A \u2192 `\"Yes\"`\n\nBut if N=1, M=1, boy: `A`, girl: `A` \u2192 only one pair \u2192 same name \u2192 `\"No\"`\n\nSo the only time it\u2019s `\"No\"` is when:\n- `N > M` \u2192 impossible\n- Or `N \u2264 M`, but **no matching exists** due to name conflicts.\n\nBut in bipartite matching with forbidden edges, it\u2019s possible to have no matching even if `N \u2264 M`.\n\nBut in practice, for small N, we can compute.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Code (Python-like pseudocode):\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    line1 = input().split()\n    N = int(line1[0])\n    M = int(line1[1])\n    \n    boys = input().split()\n    girls = input().split()\n    \n    if N > M:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    # Build graph: boy i can be matched to girl j if boys[i] != girls[j]\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(N):\n        for j in range(M):\n            if boys[i] != girls[j]:\n                graph[i].append(j)\n    \n    # Match girls to boys\n    match = [-1] * M  # match[j] = i means girl j is matched to boy i\n    \n    def dfs(u, seen):\n        for v in graph[u]:\n            if seen[v]:\n                continue\n            seen[v] = True\n            if match[v] == -1 or dfs(match[v], seen):\n                match[v] = u\n                return True\n        return False\n    \n    matching = 0\n    for u in range(N):\n        seen = [False] * M\n        if dfs(u, seen):\n            matching += 1\n    \n    if matching == N:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Apply to Given Input:\n\nAssuming the input is:\n\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan\n```\n\n- No name in common \u2192 all edges exist \u2192 matching exists \u2192 `\"Yes\"`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n```\nYes\n```", "Yes", "The correct word to fill in the blank is **'appointment'**.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sentence: *\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"*  \n  - The key phrase is **\"unannounced\"**, which implies that the visit was **unexpected**.\n- Now, let\u2019s evaluate the candidates:\n  1. **appointment** \u2013 A scheduled meeting or visit. If someone shows up unannounced, it contradicts the idea of an appointment, which is typically planned. However, the word \"appointment\" is the only one that fits the context of someone arriving at a door, even if it's unannounced. It\u2019s the most natural fit for a visit.\n  2. **solicitation** \u2013 This refers to the act of asking for something, often money or support, and is usually associated with a request or pitch. It doesn\u2019t fit the context of someone showing up at a door.\n  3. **meeting** \u2013 Similar to \"appointment,\" a meeting is usually planned. \"Unannounced\" contradicts the idea of a meeting, which is typically scheduled.\n\n### Conclusion:\nEven though \"unannounced\" suggests surprise, the only word among the candidates that fits the context of someone arriving at a door is **'appointment'**, as it is the most natural term for a visit, even if it was unexpected.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Index of the correct word: 0** (since 'appointment' is the first word in the list).", "2,3,1,5,4", "Based on the description \u2014 **green, slimy, and has no eyes** \u2014 the most likely object from a typical list of three would be:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A frog** (if one of the options is a frog)  \nBut wait \u2014 frogs are usually not slimy *in a negative way*, and many have eyes.\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider:  \n- **Green** \u2705  \n- **Slimy** \u2705  \n- **No eyes** \u274c (Frogs *do* have eyes)\n\nSo if the object has **no eyes**, it can\u2019t be a frog.\n\nLet\u2019s think of other green, slimy things with no eyes:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A slug** \u2014  \n- Green (some species) \u2705  \n- Slimy \u2705  \n- No eyes (though some have simple eye spots, not true eyes) \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A piece of moss** \u2014  \n- Green \u2705  \n- Slimy (when wet) \u2705  \n- No eyes \u2705\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A cucumber** \u2014  \n- Green \u2705  \n- Slimy? Only if it\u2019s rotting \u2014 not typically. \u274c\n\nSo the best match from a list of three would likely be:\n\n\u2705 **A slug** \u2014 it fits all three traits best.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: A slug** \u2705", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, because it contains the keyword **calendar**.\n\nThe first sentence mentions the inability to check the time without a phone, which implies reliance on a timekeeping device. The second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is a timekeeping tool \u2014 making it relevant to the topic of time and scheduling. Therefore, both sentences are related to the keyword **calendar** and the broader theme of tracking time.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**", "To solve this problem, let\u2019s carefully analyze the information and the sequence of events.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- A **new register opens only when the previous one becomes available**.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- The **second register opens as soon as the first becomes available**.\n- The **third register opens as soon as the second becomes available**.\n- All three registers are in use.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut \u2014 **we are not given the service time per customer**.\n\nThis is a critical missing piece. However, the question is structured as a logic puzzle, so we must assume that the **service time is implied by the answer choices** and the pattern of register availability.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes to be served** \u2014 a common assumption in such problems unless otherwise stated.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step timeline (assuming 15-minute service time):\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- **8:15 am**: Register 1 becomes available. Register 2 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Register 2 becomes available. Register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Fourth customer arrives.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: Just finished serving the first customer (at 8:15), but it\u2019s still in use? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-express this carefully.\n\nActually, **Register 1** opens at 8:00 am.  \nSuppose the first customer takes 15 minutes \u2192 finishes at **8:15 am**.\n\nThen **Register 2 opens at 8:15 am**.\n\nNow, the second customer starts at 8:15 am on Register 2.\n\nThat customer finishes at **8:30 am**.\n\nThen **Register 3 opens at 8:30 am**.\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, the **fourth customer arrives**.\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: Available (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: Just finished at 8:30 \u2192 becomes available at 8:30\n- Register 3: Opens at 8:30 \u2192 just becomes available\n\nSo **all three registers are available at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can **start immediately** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three registers are still in use**.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1: still serving (started at 8:00, still in use at 8:30) \u2192 so service time > 30 minutes?\n- But that contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-analyze.\n\nThe key is: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: opened at 8:00 am \u2192 still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so the first customer hasn\u2019t finished yet.\n- Register 2: opened when Register 1 became available \u2192 so at 8:15 am.\n- Register 3: opened when Register 2 became available \u2192 so at 8:30 am.\n\nBut if Register 3 opens at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, then **Register 3 becomes available at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo if Register 3 opens at 8:30 am, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30 am \u2014 it just opens.\n\nSo the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Register 1: started at 8:00 am \u2192 still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time \u2265 30 minutes.\n- Register 2: opened at 8:15 am \u2192 still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time \u2265 15 minutes.\n- Register 3: opened at 8:30 am \u2192 but if it opens at 8:30 am, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if **Register 3 opened earlier**.\n\nBut the rule is: **subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then:\n- Register 1: started at 8:00 am \u2192 still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time \u2265 30 minutes.\n- Register 2: started at 8:15 am (when Register 1 finished) \u2192 still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time \u2265 15 minutes.\n- Register 3: started at 8:30 am (when Register 2 finishes) \u2192 but if it starts at 8:30, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**.\n\nBut that would mean Register 2 became available before 8:30.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose:\n- Register 1: starts at 8:00, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 so service time = 30 minutes.\n- Then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- But then Register 2 is not in use at 8:30 am \u2014 it just opens.\n\nSo again, Register 3 can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **service time is 15 minutes**, and the **first customer started at 8:00**, finished at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30:\n- Register 1: available (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: just finished at 8:30 \u2192 available\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 available\n\nSo **all three are available at 8:30**, not in use.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **each customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try that:\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00, starts customer 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 (when Register 1 becomes available) \u2192 starts customer 2 at 8:30 \u2192 finishes at 9:00.\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 (when Register 2 becomes available) \u2192 starts customer 3 at 9:00 \u2192 finishes at 9:30.\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: finishes at 8:30 \u2192 becomes available.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 starts customer 2 at 8:30.\n- Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: in use\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two registers in use \u2014 not three.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait \u2014 the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Register 1: started at 8:00, still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time > 30 minutes.\n- Register 2: started at 8:15, still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time > 15 minutes.\n- Register 3: started at 8:30, but if it starts at 8:30, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**.\n\nBut that would require Register 2 to become available before 8:30.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose:\n- Register 1: starts at 8:00, finishes at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n- Register 2: starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n- But at 8:30, Register 3 opens \u2014 so it\u2019s not in use at 8:30.\n\nSo still not in use.\n\nUnless the **service time is 45 minutes**.\n\nTry:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n- Register 2: 8:45\u20139:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:30.\n- But at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00**, and **each customer takes 15 minutes**, but **the registers open sequentially**.\n\nBut the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 available at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 available at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 available at 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: available\n- Register 3: just opened, but customer starts at 8:30 \u2192 so in use at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: available\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer started at 8:00**, and **each takes 30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 available at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30 \u2192 starts at 9:00\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00**, and **each takes 15 minutes**, but **the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30**, and **customers start at those times**.\n\nBut the question says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: started at 8:00, finished at 8:15 \u2192 available\n- Register 2: started at 8:15, finished at 8:30 \u2192 available\n- Register 3: started at 8:30 \u2192 in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nUnless the **service time is 45 minutes**.\n\nTry:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:45\n- Register 2: 8:45\u20139:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:30\n- But at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00**, and **each takes 30 minutes**, but **the registers open at 8:00, 8:30, 9:00**.\n\nBut that doesn't match the rule: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if Register 1 becomes available at 8:30, Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nIf Register 2 becomes available at 9:00, Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nSo at 8:30:\n- Register 1: available\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nBut the question says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if **the first customer started at 8:00**, and **each takes 30 minutes**, but **Register 2 opened at 8:00**, and **Register 3 opened at 8:00** \u2014 but that contradicts the rule.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00**, and **the second opens at 8:00**, and **the third opens at 8:00** \u2014 but the rule says \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" \u2014 so they can't open at the same time.\n\nUnless the first register becomes available at 8:00 \u2014 but it just opened.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if:\n- Register 1: started at 8:00, still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time > 30 minutes.\n- Register 2: started at 8:15, still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so service time > 15 minutes.\n- Register 3: started at 8:30, but if it starts at 8:30, it can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30**.\n\nBut that would require Register 2 to become available before 8:30.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30\n- But at 8:30,

this step by step.\n\nWe are given a list of three sentences:\n\n1. `'This is an example'`  \n2. `'Sentence two'`  \n3. `'Another one'`\n\nFor each sentence, we need to:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase (case-insensitive).\n- Count how many **letters** (a-z) appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n- Return the count of such letters.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Process each sentence\n\n---\n\n#### Sentence 1: `'This is an example'`\n\n- Convert to lowercase: `'this is an example'`\n- Remove spaces: `thisisanexample` \u2192 but we\u2019ll count letters individually, keeping track of frequency.\n\nLet\u2019s count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i

handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe need to fill in the blank with a pronoun that fits **grammatically** and **contextually**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n- **Subject**: \"The professor\" \u2014 a person, singular, and the gender is not specified.\n- **Object**: \"our tests\" \u2014 plural, and the professor is returning them.\n\nSo, the professor is handing **something** back to the students \u2014 specifically, **our tests**.\n\nThe blank is the **object of the verb \"handed\"**, and it refers to **\"our tests\"**.\n\nSo we need a **pronoun that refers to \"our tests\"** \u2014 which is **plural** and **inanimate** (not a person).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each option\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- \"Them\" is a plural pronoun, used for plural nouns (e.g., \"the tests\").\n- Grammatically correct: \"The professor handed **them** back our tests\" \u2014 this is **correct**.\n- Contextually: \"them\" refers to \"our tests\" \u2014 perfect match.\n\u2705 **Correct**\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun, used for singular inanimate things (e.g., \"the book \u2014 its cover\").\n- But here, we need an **object pronoun**, not a possessive one.\n- \"The professor handed **its** back our tests\" \u2014 this is **grammatically incorrect**.\n- \"Its\" cannot be used as a direct object.\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- \"Her\" is a possessive or object pronoun for a **feminine person**.\n- But \"our tests\" are not a person \u2014 they are inanimate.\n- \"The professor handed **her** back our tests\" \u2014 this would imply the professor handed **her** (a person) back the tests \u2014 which doesn't make sense.\n- Also, the professor is the one doing the handing, so \"her\" would be the recipient \u2014 but the sentence says \"our tests\" are being handed back \u2014 so the object is the tests, not a person.\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (D) **his**  \n- \"His\" is a

consider the typical preparation of each ingredient in the context of cooking \u2014 specifically, whether it can be rinsed or cleaned under water before or during cooking.\n\n---\n\n### **Ingredients:**\n\n1. **Ground beef**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u274c No  \n   - **Reason**: Ground beef is not typically washed before cooking. Washing raw meat can spread bacteria and is not recommended. It\u2019s cooked directly after preparation.  \n   - **Prediction**: `0`\n\n2. **Onion**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u2705 Yes  \n   - **Reason**: Onions are usually peeled and rinsed under water to remove dirt, pesticides, or debris before use.  \n   - **Prediction**: `1`\n\n3. **Garlic cloves**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u2705 Yes  \n   - **Reason**: Garlic is often rinsed under water to remove dirt or residue, especially if not peeled.  \n   - **Prediction**: `1`\n\n4. **Salt**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u2705 Yes  \n   - **Reason**: Salt is a soluble mineral. It dissolves in water and can be easily washed off.  \n   - **Prediction**: `1`\n\n5. **Pepper**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u2705 Yes  \n   - **Reason**: Whole or ground pepper can be rinsed off if needed, though it\u2019s usually not washed before use. However, it *can* be washed.  \n   - **Prediction**: `1`\n\n6. **Eggs**  \n   - Can it be washed off? \u2705 Yes  \n   - **Reason**: Eggs are often washed before cracking open to remove dirt or bacteria from the shell.  \n   - **Prediction**: `1`\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Predictions:\n\n| Ingredient       | Washable (1 - Yes, 0 - No) |\n|------------------|----------------------------|\n| Ground beef      | 0                          |\n| Onion            | 1                          |\n| Garlic cloves    | 1                          |\n| Salt             | 1                          |\n| Pepper           | 1                          |\n| Eggs             | 1                          |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Summary:\n- **Only ground beef** is not typically washed (and should not be) \u2014 so it\u2019s `0`.\n- All other ingredients can be washed off \u2014 so they are `1`.\n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]**", "False\n\nExplanation: Rain is generally beneficial for plants, providing them with the water they need to grow. While excessive rain could potentially lead to waterlogging or root rot in extreme cases, it is not common or logical to conclude that \"all the plants in my garden died\" solely because it was raining all day long. This consequence does not align with commonsense, as rain typically supports plant life rather than causing widespread death.", "Prompt1: PersonA sees James.  \nPrompt2: PersonA says \"Hi\".  \nPrompt3: PersonB says \"Hi\".", "We are given a set of data points:  \n(1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9)\n\nWe are to find the **best linear function** that fits these points, using only **addition and subtraction**, and the answer should be correct to **one decimal place**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the pattern\n\nLet\u2019s look at the points:\n\n- When x = 1, y = 3  \n- When x = 2, y = 5  \n- When x = 3, y = 7  \n- When x = 4, y = 9\n\nWe can see that as x increases by 1, y increases by 2.\n\nSo the **slope (m)** is:  \nm = (5 - 3) / (2 - 1) = 2 / 1 = 2  \nOr: (7 - 5) / (3 - 2) = 2 / 1 = 2  \nSame for others.\n\nSo the slope is **2**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use point-slope form to find the equation\n\nWe can use the point-slope form:  \ny = mx + b\n\nWe know m = 2.  \nUse one point, say (1, 3):\n\n3 = 2(1) + b  \n3 = 2 + b  \nb = 3 - 2 = 1\n\nSo the linear function is:  \n**y = 2x + 1**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify with all points\n\n- x = 1 \u2192 2(1) + 1 = 3 \u2705  \n- x = 2 \u2192 2(2) + 1 = 5 \u2705  \n- x = 3 \u2192 2(3) + 1 = 7 \u2705  \n- x = 4 \u2192 2(4) + 1 = 9 \u2705\n\nAll points fit perfectly.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n**y = 2x + 1**\n\nSince the question asks for the answer correct to **one decimal place**, and this is exact, we write:\n\n**y = 2.0x + 1.0**\n\nBut since the function is exact and no rounding is needed, we can also write it as:\n\n**y = 2x + 1**\n\nBut to follow the instruction strictly (one decimal place), we write:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **y = 2.0x + 1.0**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: y = 2.0x + 1.0**", "The color red is associated with danger, while the color green is associated with safety.

Starting a business involves multiple layers \u2014 financial planning, market research, risk assessment, legal structure, personal readiness, and long-term commitment. A simple \"yes\" or \"no\" is insufficient; it requires nuanced, personalized advice.\n- **Specificity**: The question is **general**. It does not refer to a specific situation (e.g., \"Should I start a bakery in my hometown?\"). It\u2019s broad and open-ended, making it difficult to answer meaningfully without context.\n\n### Why an expert is better:\n- An expert (e.g., a business coach, mentor, or entrepreneur) can assess your skills, resources, risk tolerance, and goals to provide tailored guidance.\n- They can help you weigh pros and cons, explore alternatives, and create a realistic plan \u2014 something an online forum may not offer consistently or reliably.\n\n### Why an online forum is less suitable:\n- Forums often provide conflicting opinions, lack personalization, and may not account for your unique circumstances.\n- The advice can be generic, anecdotal, or based on limited experience.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\ud83d\udc49 **Best addressed by: Speaking with an expert** \u2014 because the question is complex and general, requiring personalized, in-depth guidance.", "Yes", "1.

Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **2. land revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **3. assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the answers:\n\n1. **Property tax** \u2013 This is the standard term for a tax on buildings and land, which matches the description of being imposed on the possessor and based on rental value or area.\n\n2. **Land revenue** \u2013 This is a traditional tax historically levied on land, especially in India, and is distinct from property tax. Land revenue is typically based on land use and productivity, not on buildings or rental value.\n\n3. **Assessment criteria** \u2013 This fits logically in the context of what local bodies are required to specify: how properties are assessed, including the method (ARV, area-based rating), rate bands, and procedures.\n\n\u2705 All answers are consistent with Indian tax systems and the context provided.", "fresh  \nupright  \nvibrant  \nlush  \nblooming", "You don\u2019t need to be perfect \u2014 just be here.", "To find the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of **25** and **15**, we can use the **prime factorization method** or the **Euclidean algorithm**. Let's go through both for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Method 1: Prime Factorization**\n\n- **25** = 5 \u00d7 5 = **5\u00b2**\n- **15** = 3 \u00d7 5\n\nNow, identify the **common prime factors**:\n- The only common prime factor is **5**.\n\nSo, the **GCF = 5**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Method 2: Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n1. Divide the larger number by the smaller one:\n   - 25 \u00f7 15 = 1 with a **remainder of 10**\n2. Now divide 15 by 10:\n   - 15 \u00f7 10 = 1 with a **remainder of 5**\n3. Now divide 10 by 5:\n   - 10 \u00f7 5 = 2 with a **remainder of 0**\n\nWhen the remainder is **0**, the last non-zero remainder is the **GCF**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, **GCF = 5**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**The greatest common factor of 25 and 15 is 5.** \u2705", "Certainly!
