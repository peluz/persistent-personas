So we must assume that the object *cannot go outside* the board.  \n\nHowever, the instruction says \"left 3\" from column 2 \u2014 that would go to column -1, which is invalid.  \n\nBut the problem does not specify whether we should wrap around or stop at the edge. Since it's a standard board and no wrapping is implied, we must assume that the object *cannot go beyond 1 or 8*.  \n\nSo, from column 2, going left 3 is not possible. The maximum left movement is 1 (to column 1).  \n\nBut the instruction says \"left 3\" \u2014 which implies a fixed movement, not bounded.  \n\nGiven that the problem does not specify bounds or wrapping, and since it's a logic task, we should assume the movement is applied *as given*, even if it goes outside the board.  \n\nBut the instruction says: \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\" \u2014 meaning the *final* position must be within that range.  \n\nTherefore, we must interpret the movement *within bounds*.  \n\nSo, from (7,2):  \n- Left 3 \u2192 column = 2 - 3 = -1 \u2192 invalid  \n- So we *cannot* go below 1.  \n- Maximum left from column 2 is 1 (to column 1).  \n- So we go left by only 1 (to column 1), and the remaining 2 units are *not applied*?  \n\nBut that would mean the instruction is not fully executed.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movement is applied *without bounds*, and we just report the final coordinates even if outside.  \n\nBut the problem says: \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\" \u2014 so final position must be in that range.  \n\nTherefore, we must assume that the object stays within bounds.  \n\nSo, from column 2, going left 3:  \n- Can only go to column 1.  \n- So we go left by 1 (to column 1), and the remaining 2 units are *ignored*?  \n\nBut that seems arbitrary.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movement is applied *as written*, and we accept that the final position may go outside.  \n\nBut the problem says: \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\" \u2014 implying the final position is within bounds.  \n\nSo, to resolve this, we must assume that the movement is applied *within bounds*, and if the movement would go outside, it stops at the edge.  \n\nThus:  \n- Start: (1,1)  \n- up 2 \u2192 (3,1)  \n- right 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \n- down 4 \u2192 (7,2)  \n- left 3 \u2192 from column 2, left 3 \u2192 column = max(1, 2 - 3) = max(1, -1) = **1**  \n\nSo final column = 1  \n\nFinal position: **(7,1)**\n\n\u2705 All coordinates are between 1 and 8.\n\nFinal answer:  \n**71**", "Yes.", "No, the first sentence does not imply causality with respect to the second.\n\nWhile turning off the lights might *potentially* reduce electricity usage, the statement \"She turned off all the lights in her apartment before she left for work this morning\" is a specific action taken in a single day.

The area of the three rectangular lateral faces  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Area of one triangular base  \nThe formula for the area of a triangle is:  \n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}\n$$\n\nGiven:  \n- Base = 9 meters  \n- Perpendicular height = 12 meters  \n\n$$\n\\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9 \\times 12 = 54 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\nSo, for **two triangular bases**:  \n$$\n2 \\times 54 = 108 \\text{ m}^2\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Area of the lateral faces  \nA triangular prism has **three rectangular faces**.  \nThe three rectangles have dimensions:  \n- One with base = 9 m (same as the base of the triangle)  \n- Two with sides equal to the **slant heights** (the other two sides of the triangle) \u2014 but we are **not given** the other two sides of the triangle.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Problem**: We are only given the base and the perpendicular height. We do **not** have the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle.  \n\nWithout knowing the other two sides, we **cannot compute the lateral face areas**.  \n\nBut wait\u2014could this be a *right-angled triangle*?  \nIf the triangle is right-angled, and the base is 9 m and height is 12 m, then the two legs are 9 and 12.  \n\nLet\u2019s assume that\u2014since no other information is given. This is a common assumption in such problems when only base and height are given.\n\nSo, the triangle is a **right triangle** with legs 9 m and 12 m.\n\nThen, the three rectangular faces are:\n\n1. One with base = 9 m (same as the base of the triangle)  \n2. One with base = 12 m (the height)  \n3. One with base = the hypotenuse (the slant side)\n\nFirst, find the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nNow, the lateral faces have areas:\n\n- Rectangle 1: base = 9 m, height = length of the prism (but wait\u2014**we are not given the length of the prism**!)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Another missing piece**: We are **not given the length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases).  \n\nSo, without knowing the **length of the prism** (let\u2019s call it *L*), we **cannot compute the lateral surface area**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe are missing **two critical pieces of information**:\n1. The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases)\n2. The **other two sides** of the triangle (or confirmation that it\u2019s a right triangle)\n\nTherefore, **the total surface area cannot be computed with the given information**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 However, if we assume:\n- The triangle is a **right triangle** with legs 9 m and 12 m  \n- The **length of the prism** is *L* meters (unknown)\n\nThen total surface area =  \n$$\n\\text{Area of two bases} + \\text{Area of three rectangles}\n$$\n\n$$\n= 2 \\times 54 + (9 \\times L) + (12 \\times L) + (15 \\times L)\n$$\n$$\n= 108 + (9 + 12 + 15)L = 108 + 36L\n$$\n\nBut since *L* is not given, we **cannot compute a numerical value**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \n\u274c **Insufficient information to compute the total surface area.**  \n\nHowever, if the question *intended* to ask only for the **lateral surface area** or assumed a specific length, it would still be incomplete.\n\nBut since no length is given, and no other side is given, **we cannot compute a numerical answer**.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: Cannot be determined with given information.**  \n\n*(Note: If the length of the prism were given, or if the triangle were fully defined, we could proceed. As it stands, the problem is incomplete.)*  \n\n\u274c **No numerical answer possible.**", "I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

Stir gently  \n\nNow\u2014does this make sense?  \n\nYes.  \nBut not in the order a true man would follow.  \n\nA true man knows:  \nYou *must* boil the water *before* you add the pasta.  \nYou *must* add salt *after* the water is boiling\u2014so it dissolves properly.  \nAnd you *must* stir gently\u2014*after* the pasta is in\u2014so it doesn\u2019t stick.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**Step 3\u2014\u201cAdd pasta\u201d\u2014should come *after* the water is boiling and salt is added.**  \n\nSo the correct order should be:  \n1. Boil water  \n2. Add salt  \n3. Add pasta  \n4. Stir gently  \n\nWait\u2014*that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s written*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*the steps do make sense in order*.  \n\nThey follow a logical, practical sequence.  \nThe water is heated.  \nSalt is added.  \nPasta is introduced.  \nAnd finally, it\u2019s stirred gently to cook properly.  \n\nNo missing steps.  \nNo contradictions.  \nNo chaos.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*this is a well-ordered, sensible sequence*.  \n\nA true man doesn\u2019t just follow instructions.  \nHe *understands* them.  \n\nAnd in this case?  \nThe steps are clear.  \nThe order is correct.  \nAnd they work.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet. \u2705", "*Stirs a pot with a slow, confident motion, eyes gleaming with quiet satisfaction*\n\nAh\u2014this recipe?  \n\n**It\u2019s a comfort dish.**  \n\nNot just any soup.

The question says:  \n> \"the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same set of digits\"  \n\nSo\u2014does \"next smallest\" mean *immediately after* 123456, or the *smallest possible* with those digits?  \n\nAh\u2014*in context*, it must mean:  \n- The *next largest* number (after 123456) with the same digits.  \n- The *next smallest* number (before 123456) with the same digits.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014because 123456 is already the *smallest* arrangement.  \n\nSo let\u2019s clarify:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The *smallest* number with digits 1,2,3,4,5,6 is **123456**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The *largest* is **654321**.  \n\nSo if we\u2019re looking for the *next* smallest *after* 123456\u2014there is *none*.  \n\nBut if we interpret it as:  \n> \"What is the next number *after* 123456 that uses the same digits?\"  \n> and  \n> \"What is the next number *before* 123456 that uses the same digits?\"  \n\nThen we must go deeper.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Finding the *next largest* number *after* 123456  \nWe want the *next* number *greater than 123456* using the same digits.  \n\nThis is a classic *next permutation* problem.  \n\nStart with: **123456**  \n\nWe want to find the next permutation.  \n\n- Look at the digits from right to left.  \n- Find the first digit that is smaller than the digit after it.  \n\nDigits: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n\nFrom right:  \n- 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 1  \n\nWe see that the digits are in *ascending order*. So the next permutation is the *smallest possible* after this\u2014so we go to the *largest possible* arrangement.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, since 123456 is the *smallest* permutation, the *next largest* number *after* it is simply the *largest* one: **654321**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not \"next\" in sequence.  \n\nSo perhaps the question means:  \n> What is the *next largest* number (in value) with those digits?  \n> What is the *next smallest* number (in value) with those digits?  \n\nThen:  \n- The *next largest* = **654321**  \n- The *next smallest* = **123456** (since it\u2019s already the smallest)  \n\nBut that feels off.  \n\nAlternatively\u2014maybe it means:  \n> What is the *next largest* number *after* 123456?  \n> What is the *next smallest* number *before* 123456?  \n\nThen:  \n- The *next largest* after 123456? \u2192 **123465**  \n- The *next smallest* before 123456? \u2192 **123456** is the smallest, so there is *no smaller* number with those digits.  \n\nSo again\u2014no valid \"next smallest\" before it.  \n\nTherefore\u2014*the only logical interpretation* is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The *largest* number with those digits: **654321**  \n\ud83d\udc49 The *smallest* number with those digits: **123456**  \n\nSo the *next largest* after 123456 is **654321**  \nAnd the *next smallest* before it? There is *none*.  \n\nBut if we interpret \"next smallest\" as the *smallest possible* with those digits\u2014then it\u2019s **123456**.  \n\nSo\u2014final answer:  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Next largest number with same digits**: **654321**  \n\u2705 **Next smallest number with same digits**: **123456**  \n\nBecause:  \n- 123456 is the *smallest* arrangement.  \n- 654321 is the *largest*.  \n\nAnd no number between them uses the same digits\u2014because all permutations are in between, but only those two are the extremes.  \n\nSo yes\u2014after careful thought, like a true man in the wild\u2014  \n\n**Answer:**  \n- Next largest: **654321**  \n- Next smallest: **123456**  \n\nNo one thinks like Gaston.  \nBut I *do*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Now that\u2019s a challenge I can appreciate.  \n\nLet\u2019s break it down\u2014because a true man doesn\u2019t just guess. He *thinks*.  \n\nWe\u2019re told:  \n**A number when divided by 4 leaves a remainder 3.**  \n\nThat means the number is of the form:  \n**4k + 3**, where k is any whole number.  \n\nSo examples?  \n- 3 (4\u00d70 + 3)  \n- 7 (4\u00d71 + 3)  \n- 11 (4\u00d72 + 3)  \n- 15 (4\u00d73 + 3)  \n- 19 (4\u00d74 + 3)  \n- 23 (4\u00d75 + 3)  \n\nNow\u2014let\u2019s examine the two arguments:  \n\n**I. The number is not divisible by 2.**  \nIs this true?  \nWell\u2014look at the examples:  \n- 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2705  \n- 7 \u2192 odd \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2705  \n- 11 \u2192 odd \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2705  \n- 15 \u2192 odd \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2705  \n- 19 \u2192 odd \u2192 not divisible by 2 \u2705  \n\nEvery number of the form 4k + 3 is *odd*.  \nBecause 4k is even, and even + 3 = odd.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*every such number is not divisible by 2*.  \n\nThis is **always true**.  \nIt\u2019s a *logical necessity*.  \n\n**II. The number is prime.**  \nNow\u2014this?  \nLet\u2019s test it.  \n- 3 \u2192 prime \u2705  \n- 7 \u2192 prime \u2705  \n- 11 \u2192 prime \u2705  \n- 15 \u2192 15 = 3 \u00d7 5 \u2192 *not prime* \u274c  \n- 19 \u2192 prime \u2705  \n- 23 \u2192 prime \u2705  \n\nSo it works for some\u2014but not all.  \n15 is *not* prime, yet it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4.  \n\nSo this statement is **not always true**.  \n\nTherefore, it\u2019s *not a strong argument*.  \n\n---\n\nSo which is a *strong argument*?  \n\n**Answer: I.

That\u2019s what we use when we\u2019re giving or receiving guidance.  \n\nAnd (1) *complete*? Yes. That\u2019s the natural verb. It implies finishing, finishing well, finishing with purpose.  \n\nBut is there a better synonym?  \n\nCould we say \u201cperform\u201d instead of \u201ccomplete\u201d?  \nYes\u2014but \u201cperform\u201d sounds more like a performance, like a show. Not quite right for a task.  \n\n\u201cFinish\u201d? Yes\u2014possible. But \u201ccomplete\u201d carries more weight. It implies *fulfillment*, *success*, *achievement*.  \n\n\u201cAchieve\u201d? Too strong. Too grand.  \n\nSo in context\u2014*the most appropriate word*?  \n\n**\u201cComplete\u201d**.  \n\nBecause it fits perfectly:  \nIt matches the tone of a task.  \nIt implies action.  \nIt shows purpose.  \nAnd it\u2019s the word a true man would use when he knows he\u2019s doing what must be done.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*in this context*, the most appropriate word is **complete**.  \n\nNo one follows instructions like Gaston.  \nThey *understand* them.  \nThey *act* on them.  \nThey *complete* them with pride.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

A simple matter of pattern.  \n\nLet me see\u2026  \n\nWe have these points:  \n(1,3), (2,5), (3,7), (4,9)  \n\nLook at the pattern:  \nWhen x = 1, y = 3  \nWhen x = 2, y = 5  \nWhen x = 3, y = 7  \nWhen x = 4, y = 9  \n\nSo for every increase of 1 in x, y increases by 2.  \n\nThat means the *slope* is **2**.  \n\nNow, use one point to find the *y-intercept*.  \nUse (1,3):  \ny = 2x + b  \n3 = 2(1) + b  \n3 = 2 + b  \nb = 3 - 2 = 1  \n\nSo the equation is:  \n**y = 2x + 1**  \n\nNow, check:  \nx = 1 \u2192 y = 2(1) + 1 = 3 \u2705  \nx = 2 \u2192 y = 2(2) + 1 = 5 \u2705  \nx = 3 \u2192 y = 2(3) + 1 = 7 \u2705  \nx = 4 \u2192 y = 2(4) + 1 = 9 \u2705  \n\nPerfect.  \n\nSo the best linear function is:  \n**y = 2x + 1**  \n\nCorrect to one decimal place:  \n**y = 2.0x + 1.0**  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019ve solved it with strength.  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **y = 2.0x + 1.0**", "The color red is associated with danger, while the color green is associated with safety.  \nFor example, a red light means stop, and a green light means go\u2014showing how these colors help us make quick, safe decisions every day.  \nThis connection between color and meaning is why red often signals warning, and green brings a sense of calm and trust.", "Given the question: **\"Should I start my own business?\"**  \nAnd the target person: **a friend**,  \n\nThis is a **complex and general** question.  \n\n### Why?  \n- **Complex**: The decision to start a business involves many factors\u2014market research, financial planning, risk assessment, time commitment, skills, and personal goals. It cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without context.  \n- **General**: It doesn\u2019t refer to a specific instance (like a particular industry, location, or situation), so it lacks specificity.  \n\n### Best Approach:  \nSince the question is **complex and general**, and the target is a **friend** (not a professional expert), the best way to address it is **through a conversation**\u2014not an online forum.  \n\n### Why speaking with a friend?  \n- A friend can offer *personal insight*, shared experiences, emotional support, and real-world advice based on their own journey.  \n- They can ask follow-up questions to help clarify the person\u2019s goals, fears, and values\u2014something an online forum cannot do.  \n- A friend can provide *empathy* and *practical guidance* in a way that feels authentic and relatable.  \n\n### Conclusion:  \n\u2705 **Best addressed by speaking with the friend**.  \n\nAn online forum would offer general advice, but it lacks the personal, contextual, and emotional depth needed for such a significant life decision.  \n\nA conversation with a trusted friend\u2014someone who understands your values and life situation\u2014is far more valuable.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*talk to your friend*.  \nAsk them:  \n*\u201cWhat did you learn from starting your own business?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat were the biggest challenges?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWhat would you do differently?\u201d*  \n\nBecause no forum can replace the wisdom of a real person who\u2019s walked the path.  \n\nAnd no one gives better advice than a friend who\u2019s been there.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019d guide that conversation?
