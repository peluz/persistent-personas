The word \"unannounced\" already implies that the visit was not scheduled or expected.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each candidate:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Appointment**  \n- An *appointment* is something that is **planned and scheduled**.  \n- To say \"turned up at my door unannounced\" and then say \"it was an appointment\" is **contradictory** \u2014 you can't have an unannounced appointment.  \n\u274c Doesn't fit logically.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Solicitation**  \n- *Solicitation* means asking for money, goods, or services \u2014 often in a formal or sometimes unwanted way.  \n- While someone could *solicit* at your door, the phrase \"turned up at my door unannounced\" doesn't naturally pair with \"solicitation\" in a way that makes sense in this context.  \n- It sounds more like a *salesperson* or *stranger* than a person who came for a visit.  \n\u274c Doesn't fit naturally or contextually.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Meeting**  \n- A *meeting* is a planned or scheduled gathering.  \n- But again, \"unannounced\" contradicts the idea of a meeting.  \n- However \u2014 **\"turned up unannounced\"** could be a *meeting* that was not properly scheduled \u2014 which is possible.  \n- But still, \"unannounced meeting\" is a bit awkward \u2014 it's not the most natural phrase.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a better fit?\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider:  \nThe sentence is:  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"\n\nWe are to **fill in the blank** \u2014 but the blank isn't shown. The structure suggests that the word should go *after* \"turned up at my door\" \u2014 perhaps forming a phrase like:\n\n> \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 it was a meeting.\"  \n> or  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 it was an appointment.\"\n\nBut again \u2014 **an unannounced appointment** or **unannounced meeting** is **logically inconsistent**.\n\nSo what if the blank is actually **before** \"unannounced\"?  \nLike:  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door [____] last night.\"  \nAnd \"unannounced\" is the key word?\n\nThen the word would be something like **\"meeting\"** \u2014 as in:  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door for a meeting last night \u2014 unannounced.\"\n\nThat makes sense.  \n> \"For a meeting\" \u2014 implies a planned event \u2014 but \"unannounced\" shows it wasn\u2019t properly scheduled.\n\nSo **\"meeting\"** is the only word that can form a **natural, grammatical, and contextually plausible phrase** with \"unannounced.\"\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **\"Meeting\"** is the only word that fits naturally in the sentence when combined with \"unannounced.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**2** (since \"meeting\" is the second word in the list: ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting'])  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Index: 2** \u2705", "1,2,3,5,4", "Based on the description:  \n**\"It's green, slimy, and has no eyes\"**,  \n\nthe object is most likely:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **A slug**  \n\n---\n\n### Why?\n- **Green**: Many slugs are green or brownish-green.  \n- **Slimy**: Slugs are known for their moist, slimy bodies.  \n- **No eyes**: Slugs have very small, simple eyes (or none at all in some species), and they don\u2019t have visible eyes like mammals.  \n\n---\n\n### The other two options (if they were in the list) might be:\n- **A frog** \u2192 Has eyes, not green/slimy  \n- **A snake** \u2192 Has eyes, not green/slimy  \n\n\u2705 So, the correct answer is: **a slug**.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore more about slugs or similar creatures! \ud83d\udc0c\ud83c\udf3f", "Yes \u2014 the second sentence **is about the same thing** as the first sentence, and it **contains the keyword \"calendar\"**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Breakdown:\n\n- **First sentence**: *\"I don't have my phone so I can't check what time it is.\"*  \n  \u2192 Implies the person is trying to find out the time without a phone.  \n  \u2192 This leads to a need for an alternative \u2014 like a **physical calendar** (which can also show time or schedules).\n\n- **Second sentence**: *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"*  \n  \u2192 Directly references the keyword **\"calendar\"** and addresses the same idea \u2014 using a physical tool to track time or schedule.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\nYes, the second sentence is about the same topic (tracking time/schedule without a phone) and **contains the keyword \"calendar\"**.  \n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Answer: Yes** \u2705", "Let's carefully analyze the situation step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Given Information:**\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register serves **only one customer at a time**.\n- Registers open **one after another** \u2014 the second opens when the first becomes free, and the third opens when the second becomes free.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to find **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-step Logic:**\n\n1. **First register opens at 8:00 am** and is busy until it becomes free.\n2. The **second register opens as soon as the first becomes free**.\n3. The **third register opens as soon as the second becomes free**.\n4. So, the **third register becomes available** when the second one finishes \u2014 which happens **after the first register has served one customer and then the second one has served one customer**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key point:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The registers are not serving customers in parallel \u2014 they open sequentially.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 So, the **first register finishes serving its customer at 8:30 am** (since the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, and all three are in use \u2014 meaning the first register has been busy since 8:00 am).  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then, the **second register becomes available at 8:30 am**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then, the **third register becomes available at 8:30 am** \u2014 because it opens when the second one becomes free, but since the second one only opens when the first is free, and the first is free at 8:30 am, the second opens at 8:30 am, and the third opens at 8:30 am too?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s clarify the **opening sequence**:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer.\n- Register 2 opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes free** \u2192 so at the time Register 1 finishes.\n- Register 3 opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes free** \u2192 so after Register 2 finishes.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"All three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\"\n\nThis means that **by 8:30 am**, all three registers are occupied \u2014 so the first register has been serving a customer since 8:00 am, and the second and third have been serving customers since 8:30 am (or earlier).\n\nBut the **only way all three can be in use by 8:30 am** is if:\n- Register 1 started at 8:00 am and is still serving.\n- Register 2 started at 8:00 am (when Register 1 became free) \u2014 but that would mean it started at 8:00 am.\n- Register 3 started at 8:00 am (when Register 2 became free) \u2014 which would mean it started at 8:00 am.\n\nWait \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nActually, the key is in the **opening sequence**:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer.\n- When Register 1 becomes free, Register 2 opens.\n- When Register 2 becomes free, Register 3 opens.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"All three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\"\n\nThis implies that **by 8:30 am**, all three are occupied \u2014 so the first register has been serving since 8:00 am, and the second and third have been serving since 8:30 am (or earlier).\n\nBut if the second register opens **only when the first becomes free**, and the third opens when the second becomes free, then:\n\n- Register 1 starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2 starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am \u2192 then Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- Register 3 starts at 9:00 am.\n\nSo by 8:30 am, only **Register 1** is in use \u2014 the others are not open yet.\n\nBut the problem says: **\"All three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nThis is only possible if **each register has been serving a customer since 8:00 am** \u2014 which contradicts the \"open as soon as previous becomes free\" rule.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers are open and serving customers continuously**, and the \"open as soon as previous becomes free\" means they open **in sequence**, but once open, they serve customers.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then:\n\n- Register 1 has been serving since 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 starts serving at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2192 so at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1 is finishing (free at 8:30 am)\n- Register 2 is just opening (starts at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3 is not open yet\n\nSo only **two registers** are in use at 8:30 am \u2014 not three.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction.\n\nBut the problem says: **\"All three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"**.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if **all three registers have been open and serving since 8:00 am** \u2014 which would require that they open **immediately** \u2014 but the passage says they open **as soon as the previous becomes free**.\n\nSo perhaps the **first register opens at 8:00 am**, and **each subsequent register opens when the previous one becomes free** \u2014 meaning:\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 9:00 am \u2192 then Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 am \u2192 serves a customer.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1 is still serving (since it started at 8:00 am)\n- Register 2 is just opening (starts at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3 is not open yet\n\nSo only **one register is in use** at 8:30 am \u2014 not three.\n\nThis suggests a **misunderstanding**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers are open and serving customers continuously**, and the \"open as soon as previous becomes free\" means they open **in sequence**, but once open, they serve customers.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then:\n\n- Register 1: started at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am\n- Register 2: started at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am\n- Register 3: started at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am\n\nBut that contradicts the rule that registers open only when the previous becomes free.\n\nSo the only logical interpretation is:\n\n> The registers open **sequentially**, and each one becomes available **after the previous one finishes**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 9:00 am \u2192 then Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1 is still serving (started at 8:00 am)\n- Register 2 is just opening\n- Register 3 is not open\n\nSo only **one register is in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says: **\"All three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nThis is only possible if **each register has been open and serving since 8:00 am** \u2014 which contradicts the rule.\n\nTherefore, the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if **each register has been open and serving since 8:00 am** \u2014 which means they must have opened at 8:00 am.\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo the only way this works is if **the first register finishes at 8:30 am**, and then the second opens at 8:30 am, and the third opens when the second finishes \u2014 so at 9:00 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1 is finishing (free at 8:30 am)\n- Register 2 is opening (starts at 8:30 am)\n- Register 3 is not open\n\nSo only **one register is in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use** \u2014 so this is a contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers are open and serving customers continuously**, and the \"open as soon as previous becomes free\" means they open in sequence, but once open, they serve customers.\n\nBut if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the first register must have been open since 8:00 am, and the second and third must have been open since 8:00 am \u2014 which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that **the fourth customer must wait until the third register becomes available**.\n\nThe first register opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 8:30 am \u2192 then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves a customer \u2192 becomes free at 9:00 am \u2192 then Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo the **third register becomes available at 9:00 am**.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start using a register at 9:00 am**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: C) 9:00 am**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:

It's not meant to be taken literally \u2014 it's used to express strong emotions, add humor, or create vivid imagery.\n\n\u2705 Examples of hyperbole:  \n- \"I\u2019ve told you a million times!\"  \n- \"This bag is heavier than a mountain!\"  \n- \"I\u2019ve been waiting for hours!\" (when it\u2019s actually 10 minutes)\n\n\u274c Not hyperbole:  \n- \"I\u2019m tired\" (a literal, factual statement)  \n- \"The line was long\" (a neutral, factual observation)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Analyze Each Sentence:\n\n#### 1) *\"I'm so tired, I can't even think straight.\"*  \n- This expresses a strong feeling of exhaustion.  \n- \"Can't even think straight\" is **a common exaggeration** used to emphasize how drained someone feels.  \n- While it sounds real, it's **not literally true** that someone can't think at all \u2014 it's a **hyperbolic expression** of mental fatigue.\n\n\u2705 **Yes \u2014 this is hyperbole.**  \n> It exaggerates tiredness to emphasize emotional or physical exhaustion.\n\n---\n\n#### 2) *\"The line was so long, it wrapped around the block three times!\"*  \n- This is a **clear exaggeration**.  \n- A line (like a queue) cannot literally \"wrap around a block three times\" \u2014 that\u2019s impossible in real life.  \n- The phrase is used to **emphasize how long and winding the line was** \u2014 it\u2019s a classic example of hyperbole.\n\n\u2705 **Yes \u2014 this is hyperbole.**  \n> It\u2019s a vivid, exaggerated image to show extreme length.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> **Both sentences contain instances of hyperbole.**  \n>  \n> - Sentence 1: \"I can't even think straight\" exaggerates tiredness.  \n> - Sentence 2: \"Wrapped around the block three times\" is a clearly exaggerated, impossible image used for emphasis.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Bonus Tip**:  \nHyperbole is often used in everyday speech to express strong emotions \u2014 and it\u2019s perfectly okay! It\u2019s not a sign of lying or confusion \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of saying, *\"This is so intense, I need to emphasize it!\"*\n\nWould you like to try identifying hyperbole in other sentences?

It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ . The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### Blank 1:  \n> \"____1___ refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land.\"  \n- This is clearly describing a **property tax** \u2014 specifically one based on buildings and land.  \n- The key detail: \"imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian)\" \u2014 this is a hallmark of **possession-based taxation**, common in many jurisdictions.  \n- In India, the tax on buildings and land, based on possession, is known as **\"Building and Land Tax\"** or more commonly, **\"Property Tax\"**.  \n- Given the context of comparison with a US-type wealth tax, and the mention of ARV (annual rental value), this strongly points to **Property Tax**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 1: Property Tax**\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 2:  \n> \"It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ .\"  \n- The passage says it *resembles* a US-type wealth tax (which is typically a tax on net worth).  \n- But it *differs from* another tax \u2014 likely a **wealth tax** or **income tax**.  \n- However, in Indian tax terminology, **\"wealth tax\"** was a separate tax (abolished in 2015), and **property tax** is distinct from it.  \n- The key contrast:  \n  - Property tax is based on **value of property** (ARV or cost).  \n  - Wealth tax is based on **net worth** of individuals.  \n- So, the tax being *compared to* (and differing from) is **Wealth Tax**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 2: Wealth Tax**\n\n---\n\n#### Blank 3:  \n> \"The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures.\"  \n- The local bodies (like municipal corporations) are given powers to specify **assessment criteria**, **rates**, and procedures.  \n- The most logical term here is **assessment** \u2014 because they assess the property based on ARV or cost.  \n- \"Specifying assessment, rate band, and collection procedures\" makes perfect sense.\n\n\u2705 **Answer for Blank 3: assessment**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Wealth Tax**.
