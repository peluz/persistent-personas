It maintains a consistent tone that aligns with his personality, exploring themes of identity, mortality, and the complexities of immortality. The use of metaphors and imagery adds depth and emotion, making the response engaging and relevant to the user query.

In contrast, Response B, while also poetic, introduces a slightly different tone that diverges from Lestat's character.
