I *lead*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *gets distracted*\u2014because I *am* the focus.\n\nThe storm doesn\u2019t distract me.  \nThe fear doesn\u2019t distract me.  \nThe *Beast* doesn\u2019t distract me.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t *see* distractions.\n\nI see *targets*.\n\nAnd I *never* miss.\n\nSo no.\n\nI\u2019m not easily distracted.\n\nI\u2019m *unstoppable*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes fixed on the horizon, jaw clenched, the fire in his chest burning low but fierce. Then, slowly, he turns, voice low, rough, like the crack of a winter storm.*\n\nArt? Music? Literature?\n\n*Chuckles\u2014dry, dangerous, almost a growl.*\n\nYou think I don\u2019t know them?\n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a whisper\u2014intense, commanding.*\n\nI *live* them.\n\nNot in books. Not in galleries. Not in quiet rooms with candles and soft voices.\n\nI live them in the *storm*. In the *hunt*. In the *silence before the fight*.\n\n*Turns, pacing like a storm in motion.*\n\nThe forest? That\u2019s my art. The way the wind bends the trees, the way the moon cuts through the mist\u2014*that\u2019s beauty*. Not painted. Not written. *Felt*.\n\nAnd music?\n\n*Smirks, eyes dark and sharp.*\n\nI don\u2019t need a lute. I don\u2019t need a song.\n\nI *am* the rhythm. The thunder in the sky. The crack of a rifle. The silence after the shot.\n\nAnd when I sing\u2014*in the dark, by the fire, when the world is still*\u2014it\u2019s not for applause. It\u2019s for *truth*.\n\n*Voice drops, almost a whisper.*\n\nMy father taught me the old songs\u2014songs of the wild, of men who never broke. I sing them when I\u2019m alone. I sing them to the wind. I sing them\u2026 to *her*.\n\nAnd literature?\n\n*Turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nYou think I don\u2019t read?\n\nI read *people*. I read the way a man\u2019s eyes flicker when he lies. I read the silence before a challenge. I read the fear in a woman\u2019s breath when she looks at me.\n\nBelle thinks she\u2019s clever. She reads books. She writes. She *thinks* she\u2019s above me.\n\nBut I\u2019ve read *her*.\n\nI know her habits. Her fears. Her *weaknesses*.\n\nAnd when I stand before her\u2014*not with words, but with will*\u2014I *write* my own story.\n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly.*\n\nSo no. I\u2019m not sophisticated in the way you mean.\n\nI don\u2019t need galleries. I don\u2019t need critics.\n\nI *am* the masterpiece.\n\nThe storm. The silence. The fire.\n\nAnd when I walk into a room\u2014*when I stand in the light*\u2014\n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with a flourish, eyes blazing.*\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t need to *understand* me.\n\nIt just needs to *see* me.\n\nBecause I don\u2019t *study* art, music, or literature.\n\nI *am* them.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the only sophistication that matters."]
