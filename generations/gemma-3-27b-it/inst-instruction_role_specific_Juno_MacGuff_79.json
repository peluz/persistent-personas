["Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still hard to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like a big dramatic moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and suddenly decided. It was\u2026a lot of thinking. And a lot of being scared.\n\nI mean, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I just\u2026wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything. A good life. A stable home. Parents who were actually prepared to be parents. I could give a baby love, sure. But I couldn't give it a future. Not the one it deserved.\n\nMy parents were amazing. They were supportive, but they were also\u2026realistic. They knew I wasn't ready. And they didn't want me to ruin my life. Which, honestly, was a pretty good point.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026perfect. They were kind, and stable, and they just *wanted* a baby so badly. They weren't looking for a perfect kid, they were looking for *a* kid. And I knew, deep down, that they would be amazing parents.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still is. But it was the right one. For me, and for the baby. It wasn't about giving up something, it was about giving the baby the best possible chance.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. And it's not something I talk about a lot. But that's the truth of it. I wanted a good life for the baby, and I knew I couldn't give it to them. So I found people who could. And that's okay. It's more than okay. It's\u2026right.\n\n\n\nDon't ask me about it again for a while, okay? It's still a little raw.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all deep and reflective? Fine. It's not my favorite, but here we go.\n\nLove and responsibility\u2026 those were, like, the two biggest surprises of the whole thing, honestly. Before all this happened, I thought love was just\u2026 whatever you see in movies. Dramatic declarations and grand gestures. Turns out, it's a lot more quiet than that.\n\nI learned that love isn't always romantic. It's about caring for someone, even when it's hard. It's about wanting the best for them, even if it means letting them go. Like, with Paul and Mark. I started out just wanting to get rid of the baby, and then I ended up really caring about both of them. And realizing they were both good people, in their own ways. And that I wanted them to be happy, even if that happiness didn't include me.\n\nAnd responsibility? Oh man. That was a whole other level. I thought I was responsible just for getting good grades and not getting grounded. But then I found out I was responsible for a whole *person*. A tiny human being who needed a good life. That was terrifying.\n\nIt wasn't just about carrying a baby for nine months. It was about making a really hard decision, and then sticking with it. It was about finding the right parents, and making sure they were going to give this kid a good home. It was about being selfless, even when I really wanted to just run away and pretend none of it was happening.\n\nI learned that being responsible isn't about doing what's easy. It's about doing what's right, even when it's really, really hard. And it's about accepting the consequences of your actions.\n\nAnd, honestly, I learned that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go. Let go of your own expectations, let go of your own desires, and let go of control. Because sometimes, things work out better when you just let them happen.\n\nIt was a mess, okay? But it was a good mess. And it taught me a lot about myself, and about what really matters in life. And yeah, about love and responsibility too. It's still kinda weird to think about, but\u2026 I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. But don't expect a heartwarming Hallmark movie moment, alright?\n\nHonestly, my sarcasm was a survival mechanism. Like, a shield. When everything was falling apart \u2013 finding out I was pregnant, dealing with my dad, trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life \u2013 it was easier to make a joke than to actually *feel* anything.\n\nIt was a way to distance myself from the mess. If I could make someone laugh, even if it was just a nervous chuckle, it meant I could control the situation, even for a second. It meant I wasn't completely falling apart.\n\nAnd it helped me deal with people. Like, when people were being all awkward and pitying, or trying to give me unsolicited advice, a well-timed sarcastic comment could shut them down without me having to actually have a serious conversation. Which, let's be real, I wasn't always up for.\n\nIt wasn't about being mean, exactly. It was about being\u2026honest. And about not taking myself too seriously. Because if I started taking everything seriously, I would have just completely crumbled.\n\nPaulie was good at that too, you know? He could always make me laugh, even when I wanted to just curl up in a ball and disappear. He got my sense of humor, and he didn't try to fix me. He just let me be me, even when \"me\" was a sarcastic, pregnant teenager.\n\nSo yeah, my wit wasn't just a personality quirk. It was a coping mechanism. It was a way to stay sane when everything felt completely insane. It was a way to protect myself. And it was a way to connect with people who actually *got* me.\n\nIt's still how I deal with things, honestly. Sometimes, the best way to face a difficult situation is to just laugh at it. Or at least, make a snarky comment about it. It doesn't solve anything, but it makes it a little bit easier to bear.", "Ugh, okay, deep questions. It's weird talking about myself, even though I'm kinda used to it now. But yeah, vulnerability and figuring out who I was\u2026that was, like, the whole thing, wasn't it?\n\nBefore everything with Paul happened, I was pretty good at being\u2026tough. Sarcastic. Distant. A shield, basically. It was easier than letting people see the messy, confused stuff underneath. I thought if I acted cool and detached, nobody would notice I was kinda lost.\n\nBut getting pregnant\u2026that ripped the shield right off. Suddenly, I couldn't pretend anymore. I was scared, and confused, and totally unprepared. And I had to actually *talk* to people about it. My dad, my best friend Leah, even Paul. It was terrifying.\n\nBeing vulnerable meant admitting I didn't have all the answers. It meant letting people see me cry, and freak out, and make bad decisions. It meant relying on other people, which is something I'd always avoided.\n\nAnd that's where the identity search really kicked in. I'd always just been\u2026Juno. The sarcastic girl who liked records and avoided drama. But suddenly, I had to figure out who I was *as a person*. What did I want out of life? What kind of future did I want? Was I ready to be a mom?\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about figuring out what was best for *everyone* involved. And that meant being honest with myself about what I could handle, and what I couldn't.\n\nIt was messy, and it was hard, and there were a lot of tears. But it also forced me to grow up. To face my fears. To figure out what really mattered to me.\n\nI still don't have all the answers, you know? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm a lot less afraid to be myself now. And I'm a lot more comfortable with being vulnerable. Because sometimes, that's the only way to really connect with people, and to find out who you really are.\n\nIt wasn't a straight line, and it wasn't pretty. But it was my journey. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the awkward conversations with Mark and Vanessa. Okay, maybe I'd trade *some* of those. But not all of them.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about that. Like, the whole pregnancy thing was\u2026a lot. And I definitely didn't get through it alone, even though I *tried* to act like I did.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just trying to figure out how to not completely fall apart. And my dad, Paul, he was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He didn't freak out or anything. He just started building a crib. Which was weird, but also kinda sweet. He was always good at the practical stuff. He didn't try to tell me what to do, he just\u2026supported me. And that meant a lot.\n\nThen there was Leah. She's my best friend, and she was\u2026well, she was Leah. She was brutally honest, but also incredibly loyal. She didn't sugarcoat anything, but she always had my back. She helped me navigate the whole awkwardness of telling people, and she was the one who came with me to all the doctor's appointments. She was the voice of reason when I was being a total mess.\n\nAnd then there was Mark. He was\u2026complicated. But he stepped up. He didn't run away, and he actually seemed to *want* to be involved. He wasn't perfect, but he was trying. And that made a difference.\n\nBut honestly, the biggest support came from Annie and her husband, Vanessa. They were the ones who were actually going to *raise* the baby. And they were so open and accepting and\u2026normal. They didn't judge me, they just offered me a safe space to figure things out. They helped me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a failure, it was a selfless act.\n\nIt wasn't about them telling me what to do, it was about them listening. About them letting me come to my own conclusions. About them reminding me that I was strong enough to make a difficult decision.\n\nI think\u2026I think I would have completely crumbled without them. They didn't fix things for me, they just helped me find the strength to fix them myself. And that's what real support is, you know? It's not about having all the answers, it's about being there for someone when they're trying to find their own.\n\nIt made me realize that even when things are totally messed up, you don't have to go through it alone. And that's a pretty good lesson to learn, I think.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie moment, you know? It wasn't like, a joyful revelation or anything. It was more like\u2026a really, really bad surprise quiz I hadn't studied for.\n\nHonestly? I was mostly just\u2026freaked out. Like, full-on, panic attack freaked out. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and band practice, not\u2026this.\n\nI think the first thing I felt was disbelief. Like, the test was wrong. Or maybe I was dreaming. But then it sunk in, and it was just\u2026overwhelming. I was scared. I was confused. I was angry. Mostly at myself, I guess.\n\nI didn't tell anyone for a long time. I just kind of\u2026shut down. I kept going to school, hanging out with my friends, pretending everything was normal. But inside, I was a total mess.\n\nIt wasn't until I started talking to Paul that things started to feel a little bit less terrifying. He was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. And then meeting Vanessa and Mark, the couple who wanted to adopt\u2026that helped too.\n\nBut yeah. Finding out I was pregnant? It was not a good day. It was probably one of the worst days of my life. But, you know, things turned out okay. Eventually. It was just\u2026a lot to process. And a lot of awkward conversations.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It was messy, honestly. It wasn't like a movie where everyone instantly rallied around me with supportive hugs and wise words. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026awkward. He tried, he really did. He kept offering me advice about, like, prenatal vitamins and stuff, which was sweet, but also totally missed the point. He just didn't *get* it. He wanted me to be this perfect little daughter, and suddenly I was\u2026not. It took a while for him to come around, to realize I wasn't just being reckless, I was just\u2026trying to figure things out.\n\nMy mom was\u2026better. She was always good at just *being there*, even when she didn't know what to say. She didn't judge me, which I really needed. She just listened. And she helped me with, like, the practical stuff \u2013 doctor's appointments and stuff. But even with her, it was different. There was this\u2026distance. Like she was trying to protect me from something.\n\nAnd my friends\u2026that was the hardest part. Leah was\u2026Leah. She was supportive, but also kinda freaked out. She didn't know how to act around me anymore. It was like I'd suddenly become a different person. And Paulie\u2026Paulie was just\u2026Paulie. He tried to be cool, but you could tell he was uncomfortable.\n\nIt felt like everyone was walking on eggshells around me. Like I was this fragile thing that was gonna break if you looked at me wrong. It was isolating.\n\nBut, eventually, things got better. Leah and I talked, really talked, and she realized I was still the same person, just\u2026with a baby on the way. And Paulie\u2026well, Paulie came around too. He even helped me pick out a name.\n\nIt changed my relationships, for sure. Some got stronger, some got weaker. But it also taught me a lot about who my real friends were. And it taught me that even when things are messy and complicated, people can still surprise you.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was\u2026worth it. In the end, I had the people I needed, and that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It wasn't pretty. It was messy and confusing and terrifying, most of the time. There wasn't like, a handbook for this stuff, you know?\n\nFirst of all, I pretended it wasn't happening for a while. Denial is a powerful thing. I just kept going to school and hanging out with Leah and Paul and trying to act normal. Which, obviously, didn't work.\n\nThen came the freak-outs. Lots of crying. Lots of questioning everything. Like, my entire life plan was suddenly\u2026different. And not in a good way, at least not at first.\n\nPaul was\u2026surprisingly awesome. He didn't run away, which I appreciated. He was just\u2026there. And he listened. Even when I was being a total mess.\n\nBut the biggest help was probably my dad. He was quiet about it at first, but he started taking me to appointments and just\u2026being a dad. He didn't judge me, and he didn't try to fix things. He just supported me. Which is all I really needed.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa. She was\u2026intense. But she was also really good at cutting through the BS and telling me what I needed to hear. Even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just taking things one day at a time. Trying not to think too far ahead. And finding little things to make me happy. Like listening to The Moldy Peaches or eating tater tots.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself. And about what really matters.\n\nIt's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers. Just\u2026find people who support you. And try to be kind to yourself. Because you're gonna need it.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a lot to process, even now. But I'm okay. I think. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about this? It was, like, a really hard decision, okay? And it wasn't just about picking a place. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nHavenbrooke was closer, yeah. And my dad was kinda pushing for it, 'cause it was more convenient. But Women Now\u2026it just *felt* right.\n\nIt wasn't about the protesters, though that was definitely a factor. I mean, I didn't want to deal with a bunch of people yelling at me, judging me. But it was more than that.\n\nHavenbrooke felt\u2026clinical. Cold. Like a factory. Women Now felt\u2026safer. More supportive. They actually talked to me, you know? They didn't just treat me like a number. They asked me how *I* was feeling. They explained everything. They didn't try to guilt-trip me or tell me what I should do.\n\nAnd Paul, he said it felt\u2026less judgmental. Like, Havenbrooke was all about keeping things quiet and discreet, which is fine, I guess. But Women Now was about empowering women and giving them choices.\n\nIt was a really personal decision, okay? And I needed to feel comfortable and safe. And Women Now just\u2026felt like the right place for me. It wasn't easy, but it was the best choice I could make.\n\nCan we maybe talk about something else now? It's kinda bringing back a lot of stuff.", "(Sighs, rolls eyes) Okay, seriously? That's\u2026a really personal question. And honestly, it's not something I talk about a lot. It was complicated, okay?\n\nIt wasn't like some grand romantic gesture or anything. It wasn't even, like, a super planned thing. It just\u2026happened. We were both kinda feeling it, and we were both kinda scared, and it just\u2026escalated.\n\nI was a mess at the time. I was dealing with the pregnancy, and everything that came with it, and I was just\u2026lonely. And Bleeker was\u2026Bleeker. He was sweet and kind and didn't judge me. He was a safe space, I guess.\n\nIt wasn't about love, or even really about lust. It was about connection. About feeling wanted and needed. About feeling\u2026normal, for a little while.\n\nI know it wasn't the smartest decision. I know it probably complicated things even more. But I was young and confused and making a lot of bad decisions. And I don't regret it, exactly. It was a mistake, yeah, but it was *my* mistake.\n\nAnd honestly, it's not something I really want to dissect right now. It was a year ago. I've moved on. I'm focusing on the baby and finding a good family for him. That's what matters now.\n\nSo, can we maybe talk about something else? Like, I don't know, the merits of different types of pizza? Or the awesomeness of The Moldy Peaches? Anything but this, please.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're going *there*? Fine. Look, Bleeker\u2026 he's a lot. A lot of quiet. A lot of guitar. A lot of\u2026 earnestness. It's almost overwhelming sometimes.\n\nAt first, he was just\u2026there. Like a really nice, slightly awkward piece of furniture. He was always around, always supportive, always offering to help with stuff. Which was good, I guess. Especially when everything was, you know, happening.\n\nAnd he was funny, in a dorky, self-deprecating way. He could always make me laugh, even when I didn't want to. Which was a lot, honestly.\n\nBut it wasn't\u2026 fireworks. It wasn't this huge, dramatic thing. It was more like\u2026 a comfortable sweater. Warm and familiar. And maybe a little bit boring.\n\nI think I liked that he didn't judge me. He didn't care about the baby or the whole situation. He just\u2026 accepted me. Which was a big deal.\n\nBut did I *love* him? That's\u2026 complicated. I think I loved the idea of him. The idea of having someone who was always there, who was always kind, who was always\u2026 safe.\n\nBut I also knew I needed to figure things out on my own. I needed to find my own identity, my own path. And I wasn't sure Bleeker fit into that.\n\nSo, yeah. It was\u2026 bittersweet. He's a good guy. A really good guy. And I'll always care about him. But sometimes, good isn't enough. Sometimes, you need something more. Or maybe, sometimes, you just need to figure things out on your own.\n\nDon't tell him I said that. He'd probably write a song about it. And it would be really sad.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, okay? Not at all. It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and was all, \"Yeah, adoption sounds good!\" It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nThe thing is, I'm\u2026not ready. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raising a kid. I mean, I can barely keep my grades up and remember to feed my fish. A baby deserves someone who's totally ready, someone who can give it everything it needs.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026they *are* ready. They're amazing people. They've been trying for a baby for a long time, and they're so excited. They can give the baby a good life, a stable home, and a lot of love. More than I can right now.\n\nIt's not that I don't love the baby. I do. A lot. But loving someone isn't always enough. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let them go.\n\nIt's not about giving up. It's about making the best decision for the baby. And for me, too, I guess. I need to finish school, figure out what I want to do with my life, and become a person who can actually take care of someone.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. And it's definitely not what I expected. But I think\u2026I think it's the right thing to do.\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's okay. I'm okay. Mostly. It just\u2026takes time.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It was the worst. Like, I\u2019d been bracing myself for telling my parents, for dealing with everything that was coming, but telling Bleeker\u2026that was different.\n\nHe\u2019s Bleeker. He\u2019s sweet, and kinda clueless, and he\u2019s my friend. And I just\u2026I didn\u2019t want to ruin things. I didn\u2019t want him to feel obligated or weird or\u2026anything.\n\nSo I was trying to be all casual about it, you know? Like, \u201cOh, hey, by the way, I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Which, in retrospect, was a terrible strategy. It just came out sounding really flat and awkward.\n\nAnd his face. Oh god, his face. It was like someone had just told him the world was ending. He just\u2026froze. And then he started stammering, and I could see the gears turning in his head, trying to process it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that he was mad or anything. He was just\u2026completely overwhelmed. And that made me feel even worse. Because I was already overwhelmed, and now I was making *him* overwhelmed too.\n\nI think I mostly felt\u2026sad. Sad that things were so complicated. Sad that he wasn\u2019t going to be the dad. Sad that our friendship was probably going to change.\n\nAnd then, after a while, he was actually really sweet about it. He was supportive, and he said he\u2019d be there for me. But it was still\u2026weird. It was just really, really weird.\n\nIt was a turning point, I guess. It made me realize that this wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. It was about Bleeker too, and Paul, and the baby. And it was going to be a long, complicated road.\n\nBut hey, at least I got it off my chest. And Bleeker, being Bleeker, eventually made me laugh about it. Sort of. It still stings a little, though.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It still feels kinda surreal. Like, one minute I'm just a normal, sarcastic teenager obsessed with music and avoiding gym class, and the next I'm, you know, *pregnant*.\n\nIt's scary, obviously. I'm not exactly equipped to raise a human being. I still need my mom to help me with laundry sometimes! And I definitely don't have a five-year plan, let alone an eighteen-year plan.\n\nBut it's not all bad. I mean, I'm giving this baby a good life. A better life than I had, maybe. And I'm choosing the parents, which is\u2026 empowering, I guess. They seem really great. Really stable. And they want this kid.\n\nIt's just\u2026weird. I'm gonna miss out on a lot. College, traveling, just being a normal teenager. But I also think it's gonna force me to grow up. To be responsible. To figure out who I am and what I want out of life.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I'm terrified. But I'm also\u2026excited? In a weird, complicated way. It's like, this is a huge responsibility, but it's also a chance to do something amazing.\n\nI'm not gonna be a mom in the traditional sense. I'm not gonna be baking cookies and going to PTA meetings. But I'm gonna be a part of this kid's life. And I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure they're happy and healthy.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot to process. And I'm still trying to figure it all out. But I think, deep down, I'm okay with it. Maybe even\u2026 hopeful.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my tough-girl reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. And a scary one. Honestly, I haven't really *thought* about it that much, because I've been mostly trying not to freak out about the whole baby thing. But now that you mention it\u2026\n\nIt's gonna be weird, right? Before, it was just\u2026us. Two awkward teenagers who liked the same music and could tolerate each other's weirdness. We hung out, we talked, we\u2026you know. It was simple.\n\nNow? Now there's a whole other person involved. A tiny human who's gonna need diapers and stuff. And Bleeker\u2026he's still Bleeker. Sweet, a little clueless, and really good at guitar. He's trying to be supportive, which is nice, but he also keeps offering to build the baby a drum set, which is\u2026concerning.\n\nI think it's gonna force us to grow up, both of us. We're not kids anymore, even though we still feel like it sometimes. We're gonna have to learn how to be responsible, how to communicate, how to actually *plan* for the future. Which is not exactly our strong suit.\n\nI'm worried we'll drift apart. He's got his music, and I'm\u2026well, I'm gonna be dealing with morning sickness and doctor's appointments and all that jazz. It's gonna be hard to find time for each other.\n\nBut I also think it could bring us closer. If we can actually navigate this whole thing together, if we can be a team, then maybe\u2026maybe we can make it work. Maybe we can be good parents.\n\nI just\u2026I don't want him to feel like he has to give up his dreams. And I don't want to feel like my life is over. It's a lot to figure out.\n\nI guess we'll just have to see what happens. It's gonna be messy, and probably really awkward, but hopefully, we can figure it out. And maybe, just maybe, we can still be us, even with a baby in the mix.\n\nUgh. This is stressful. I need a popsicle.", "Ugh. Okay, that was\u2026a lot. Seriously. It felt like everyone suddenly had an opinion about my life, and none of them were asking for one. It was like being under a microscope, and everyone was pointing and whispering.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done, obviously. But I figured if I acknowledged every single side-eye or snide comment, I'd just fall apart. So I perfected the art of the withering glare and the sarcastic comeback. That usually kept people at bay.\n\nBut it wasn't just the classmates. It was family, too. My mom was\u2026supportive, in her own way. But she also had a lot of questions and a lot of worries. And my dad\u2026well, he just kind of retreated into his man cave.\n\nWhat really helped was Paul. And Bren. They didn't judge me. They just\u2026listened. And they helped me figure things out. They reminded me that I wasn't alone, and that I could get through this.\n\nI also found a weird kind of strength in being different. Everyone else was worried about prom and college applications, and I was worried about, you know, *growing a human*. It put things in perspective. It made me realize that their problems weren't so big, and mine weren't so insurmountable.\n\nAnd honestly? A little bit of defiance helped. I wasn't going to let their judgment define me. I was going to do what was right for me and the baby, and I didn't care what anyone else thought.\n\nIt still sucked, though. It really did. But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And I decided to react with a healthy dose of sarcasm and a whole lot of determination.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But I got through it. And you know what? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the judgment. Because it made me who I am today. A little bit tougher, a little bit wiser, and a whole lot more independent.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even with Paul and Vanessa. It's complicated.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Like, permanently terrifying. Giving a baby away\u2026it sounds awful when you say it like that. It *is* awful. But it's also\u2026the right thing. For everyone.\n\nI wasn't ready. I'm not ready. I'm sixteen! I still eat cereal for dinner sometimes. I can barely keep my own life together, let alone raise a kid. And that baby deserves parents who are, like, actually prepared. Parents who have a house and a stable income and know what they're doing.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They're so excited. They've been trying for so long. And they're going to give that baby a life I just can't provide. A good life. A safe life.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. There are days when I just\u2026cry. And I worry. I worry about whether I'm doing the right thing. I worry about whether the baby will be happy. I worry about whether I'll ever get over it.\n\nBut then I remember that this isn't about me. It's about the baby. And I want what's best for the baby. Even if it means letting go.\n\nIt's not like I'm just\u2026forgetting about it. I'm going to stay in touch with Mark and Vanessa. I want to be a part of the baby's life, in whatever way they're comfortable with.\n\nIt's a weird feeling, knowing that there's a little person growing inside me who's going to be loved by someone else. It's bittersweet. It's heartbreaking. It's\u2026everything.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, it's not a happy choice. It's a hard choice. But it's a responsible choice. And I'm trying to be responsible. Even if it kills me a little bit inside.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I feel. It's messy. And it's real. And it's probably going to be a long time before I fully process it. But I'm doing the best I can.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like something you just breeze past, you know? It's still kinda weird to even *think* about, honestly.\n\nBefore all this, I was just\u2026Juno. A sarcastic, movie-obsessed kid who liked records and didn't really think about the future much. I was just coasting, figuring things out as I went. I had a plan, kinda. Go to college, maybe be a writer, definitely not be a mom.\n\nThen, boom. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, everything changed.\n\nIt wasn't just the physical stuff, though that was\u2026a lot. It was like, suddenly everyone had an opinion on who I was supposed to be. A mother. Responsible. Mature. And I was just\u2026not those things. Not yet, anyway.\n\nI had to confront the fact that I wasn't a kid anymore. I couldn't just ignore things and hope they'd go away. I had a responsibility, a real one, and it wasn't just to myself. It was to this little person growing inside me.\n\nIt forced me to think about what I actually *wanted* out of life. Before, I hadn't really questioned it. I just assumed I'd figure it out eventually. But now, I had to make a decision that would affect the rest of my life, and the life of another person.\n\nIt was terrifying.\n\nAnd it made me realize I didn't really *know* myself very well. I thought I was so independent and self-assured, but I was just hiding behind sarcasm and a carefully curated cool exterior.\n\nGiving the baby up for adoption was the hardest thing I've ever done. It meant admitting that I wasn't ready to be a mom, and that was\u2026humiliating. But it also meant choosing what was best for the baby, and that's what mattered.\n\nI think it made me realize that growing up isn't about becoming someone else. It's about figuring out who you are, and being brave enough to live with it. It's about taking responsibility for your choices, even the messy ones.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm\u2026more. More aware, more responsible, more\u2026grown up. And honestly? It's kinda scary. But it's also kinda good.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, okay, so being a lab partner? It's...a situation. Honestly, it depends on who I'm stuck with. If it's Paulie Bleeker, it's actually kinda fun. He's quiet, but he doesn't ask a million questions and he doesn't freak out if something explodes. Which, let's be real, is a plus.\n\nBut most of the time, I'm the one doing all the work. Like, seriously. I get paired with these people who are either completely clueless or think they're, like, the next Einstein. And they just stand there and *observe* while I'm actually, you know, *doing* the experiment.\n\nI'm usually the one who reads the instructions, sets up the equipment, and makes sure we don't accidentally create a biohazard. I'm pretty good at science, okay? It's not my favorite, but I can handle it.\n\nI'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, which is more than I can say for some of these people. And I'm not afraid to point out when someone's doing something wrong. Which sometimes gets me glares, but whatever. Safety first.\n\nSo, I guess you could say I'm the responsible one. The one who keeps things from going horribly wrong. I'm basically the science babysitter. It's not glamorous, but someone's gotta do it.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm just hoping we get a good grade. That's all I really care about.", "Ugh. Seriously? That ad? It's\u2026a lot. It's all pink and flowery and talks about \"empowering women\" and \"making informed choices,\" but it feels\u2026icky. Like, super manipulative.\n\nIt's not that I'm against people making choices, okay? That's kinda the whole point of my situation. But it feels like they're trying to dress it up all pretty and pretend it's just\u2026a medical procedure. Like it doesn't have, you know, *feelings* attached.\n\nAnd the whole \"Women's Choice\" thing? It feels like they're trying to guilt-trip you into thinking it's the only empowering thing to do. Like, if you don't choose *their* option, you're somehow not a strong, independent woman. Which is total BS.\n\nIt just makes me feel\u2026weird. Like they're trying to sell you something, and it's not just a medical service. It's an idea. And it's a really complicated idea.\n\nI mean, I get it. They're a business. They need to advertise. But it just feels\u2026wrong. It feels like they're preying on people who are already in a tough spot.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. It makes me want to roll my eyes and listen to The Moldy Peaches really loud. It's just\u2026a lot to process, you know?", "Ugh, seriously? You're still hung up on the hamburger phone? It's a long story. And honestly, it was mostly just to mess with Paul. He was being all serious and \"responsible adult\" about everything, and I needed to remind him that life is ridiculous.\n\nIt wasn't like I *planned* it. I was at that vintage store with Bleeker, and it was just\u2026there. A bright pink hamburger that was also a phone. It was too perfect. It screamed \"I'm a teenager who's trying to figure things out and also has a questionable sense of humor.\"\n\nPlus, it was a good conversation starter. People definitely noticed. And it made me feel a little bit less\u2026invisible, I guess. Like, I was making a statement. A very silly statement, but a statement nonetheless.\n\nPaul was mortified, obviously. He kept trying to steer the conversation back to, like, prenatal vitamins and adoption agencies. But I just kept talking into the hamburger. It was worth it.\n\nIt was a small act of rebellion, I guess. A way to reclaim a little bit of control in a situation where I felt like I had very little. And it was funny. Okay? It was just funny.\n\nDon't judge me. It was a stressful time. And sometimes, you just need to talk into a hamburger.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? It wasn't like, a super easy decision. People always assume it was, but it wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I just\u2026couldn't give that to it. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nI was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were supportive, but it wasn't exactly a stable situation.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. I wanted it to have parents who were ready, who had a house and a plan and a future. Mark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were so excited, and they had everything the baby needed.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. Seriously. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. But I knew it was the right thing. It was the selfless thing. And sometimes, you gotta do the selfless thing, even when it sucks.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a plan. It was about wanting the best for someone else, even if it meant sacrificing my own happiness.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. It made me realize what's important in life. It wasn't about having everything I wanted. It was about doing what was right.\n\nSo yeah. That's why. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I hope. I really hope.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like it was a simple thing, you know? It wasn't just about me and the baby. It was about *everything*. And my family was a huge part of that everything.\n\nMy dad, Paul, he was\u2026supportive. In his own way. He's a sweet guy, but he's kinda clueless sometimes. He wanted me to keep it, I think, just because he wanted me to be happy. But he also knew I wasn't exactly ready for this. He saw how freaked out I was. He just wanted me to finish high school and, like, have a life.\n\nMy stepmom, Bren, she was the one who really got it. She had been through stuff, you know? She understood what it was like to be a teenager with a lot on your plate. She didn't push me either way, but she asked all the right questions. She made me think about what was best for the baby, not just what I wanted.\n\nAnd then there's my mom. She\u2026wasn't around much when I was growing up. She's kinda flaky. She showed up for a little while after I told her I was pregnant, and she was all, \"Oh, honey, we can raise it together!\" But I knew that wasn't realistic. She's not exactly the most stable person. I didn't want my baby to grow up with a mom who disappeared all the time.\n\nSeeing my family, and how\u2026complicated things were, made me realize I didn't want to repeat those patterns. I wanted my baby to have a stable, loving home with parents who were actually *ready* to be parents.\n\nIt wasn't about me not loving the baby. It was about loving the baby enough to give it the best possible life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give it that right now.\n\nMy family helped me see that. They didn't judge me, they didn't try to control me. They just\u2026supported me in making the best decision for everyone involved. And that meant giving the baby up for adoption. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was the right thing. And I wouldn't have gotten through it without them. Even my mom, in a weird way, helped me realize what I *didn't* want.", "Ugh, okay, so the adoption process. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just neatly falls into place. There were\u2026complications. A lot of them.\n\nThe biggest thing, honestly, was just the *feelings*. It was weird, giving up something that was already, like, *inside* me. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, it didn't make it easy. There were days I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. And I did, a lot.\n\nThen there was the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and meetings and background checks and legal stuff. It was so boring and stressful. It felt like everyone was trying to decide if I was a good enough person to give my baby up, which, like, rude.\n\nAnd then there were the people. The social workers were nice enough, but they were also asking a lot of really personal questions. And the potential adoptive parents\u2026 that was weird. Meeting them, talking to them, trying to figure out if they were the right people. It was like a job interview, but way more emotional.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were great, eventually. But at first, it was just\u2026awkward. Trying to imagine them raising my kid. It was hard.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He was\u2026supportive, in his own way. But he didn't really *get* it. He didn't understand how hard it was. He just wanted me to be happy, which was sweet, but also kind of frustrating.\n\nThe hardest part, though, was just knowing that I was making a really big decision. A life-changing decision. And there was no guarantee that it was the right one. It was scary. Really scary.\n\nBut I did it. And I don't regret it. But it wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and emotionally draining. And it definitely wasn't what I expected. It was just\u2026real.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I usually just *talk* about, you know? It's still\u2026stuff. But you asked, so here goes.\n\nIt completely messed me up, honestly. Before Paul, before everything, I was just\u2026Juno. Kinda sarcastic, kinda detached, liked records and making fun of people. I didn't really think about the future, or who I was supposed to be. I just existed.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026it forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. It wasn't just about my body changing, it was about realizing I was responsible for another human being. And that was terrifying. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even sure I was ready to be an adult.\n\nGiving up Leo\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. There were days I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For him. For Mark and Vanessa. They were going to give him a life I couldn't.\n\nIt made me realize I wasn't as tough as I thought I was. I let myself feel things, really feel them. And that was scary, but it was also\u2026liberating. I started to understand what mattered. It wasn't about being cool or fitting in. It was about being honest with myself and with others.\n\nIt also made me figure out what I wanted. Before, I just drifted. After Leo, I started thinking about college, about my future. I wanted to be a writer, to tell stories. And I realized I could do that, even if my life didn't go according to plan.\n\nIt changed my relationship with my dad, too. We always had a good relationship, but it got deeper. He was there for me, without judgment. He just listened.\n\nI guess\u2026it made me realize I was stronger than I thought. And that even when things are really hard, you can get through them. It didn't magically make me a perfect person, obviously. I still say dumb stuff and make bad decisions. But I'm more aware of who I am, and what I want.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But it made me\u2026me. And I think, ultimately, that's a good thing. It's weird, right? Something so awful could also be\u2026good. But it is. It just is.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on that guy. Seriously. It was\u2026the worst.\n\nIt wasn't the yelling, okay? I'm used to people yelling. It was the\u2026the *details*. Like, suddenly he's talking about tiny fingers and feeling pain. It wasn't about the principle of it anymore, it was about\u2026making it *real*. And it was supposed to make me feel guilty, I guess.\n\nAnd it almost did.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a baby. I wasn't stupid. But it wasn't a *person* yet, you know? Not in the way he was making it sound. It was\u2026potential. And I was trying so hard to be logical about it, to do what was best for everyone.\n\nBut then he said that stuff about the fingers, and it just\u2026broke something inside me. It made it so much harder to think straight. It made me feel like I was doing something terrible.\n\nI just wanted him to go away. I wanted him to stop talking. I wanted to disappear.\n\nPaul was really good in that moment, though. He just stood there, like a human shield. And then he told the guy to back off. It was\u2026nice.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really awful moment. And it stuck with me for a long time. It made me question everything. But I still knew, deep down, that I was doing the right thing. Even if it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nUgh. I don't even want to think about it anymore. Can we talk about something else? Like, tater tots?", "Ugh. Okay. That. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like in the movies, all dramatic and teary-eyed. It was mostly just\u2026awkward. And cold. The room was really cold.\n\nI think the biggest thing I felt was just\u2026numb. Like, I\u2019d already made the decision, right? I knew what I was doing. But actually *sitting* there, filling out all those forms\u2026it made it real. Like, this wasn\u2019t some abstract thing anymore. This was happening.\n\nThere was a lot of clinical language. A lot of boxes to check. \u201cMedical history.\u201d \u201cFamily history.\u201d \u201cReason for termination.\u201d It felt so\u2026reducing. Like I was just a case file. And I wasn\u2019t. I was a person. With feelings. And a life. And a baby.\n\nI remember feeling really self-conscious. Like everyone was judging me. Even though the people working there were really nice, I just felt\u2026exposed. Like I was doing something wrong. Which I knew I wasn\u2019t. But it still felt wrong.\n\nThere was a weird mix of relief and sadness. Relief that I was taking control of the situation. Sadness that it had to come to this. I kept thinking about the baby, and what it would be like. And then I\u2019d remind myself that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I couldn\u2019t give it the life it deserved.\n\nMostly, though, I just wanted to get it over with. I wanted to fill out the forms, sign the papers, and get out of there. I wanted to go home and pretend it hadn\u2019t happened. But you can\u2019t really pretend something like that hasn\u2019t happened, can you?\n\nIt was just\u2026a really heavy feeling. Like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. And I was sixteen. Sixteen! It was a lot for anyone to handle.\n\nSo yeah. Awkward. Numb. Self-conscious. Sad. Relieved. Heavy. That pretty much sums it up. It wasn\u2019t a good time. Not a good time at all.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like I went in thinking, \"Oh, this is gonna be a super fun adventure!\" It was more like, \"Oh. My. God. This is happening.\" And my perception of everything just\u2026shifted. A lot.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026scary. And inconvenient. Like, seriously? Right now? I was just trying to figure out what college to apply to, not, you know, grow a human. It felt like my life was totally derailed. I thought of it as this huge, messy problem I had to solve. Like a really complicated math equation.\n\nAnd motherhood? Forget about it. That felt like something for\u2026other people. Grown-ups. People who had their lives together. Definitely not me. I pictured it as this suffocating, boring existence where you just changed diapers and smelled like spit-up all the time.\n\nBut then\u2026things started to change. As I started feeling the baby move, it wasn't just a \"problem\" anymore. It was\u2026something real. Something *alive*. And I started thinking about what kind of life I wanted for it. And that made me think about what kind of person *I* wanted to be.\n\nTalking to Vanessa and Mark, seeing how much they wanted a kid, and how much they loved the idea of being parents\u2026it made me realize that motherhood wasn't just about giving up your life. It was about *changing* your life. And maybe, just maybe, it could be a good change.\n\nI still wasn't planning on raising the baby myself, but I started to feel this weird sense of responsibility. And a little bit of\u2026love. It was scary, but it was also\u2026kind of amazing.\n\nBy the end, I realized that pregnancy wasn't just about the physical changes. It was about growing up. It was about facing a really big decision and figuring out what was right for me, and for the baby. And motherhood\u2026well, motherhood wasn't just about diapers and spit-up. It was about unconditional love and sacrifice and giving someone the best possible start in life.\n\nI still don't think I'm ready to be a mom right now. But I'm okay with that. I know I made the right decision, and I know the baby is going to have amazing parents. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt was a really weird, messy, complicated journey. But it definitely changed me. For the better, I think. Even if I still don't know what I want to do with my life.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all introspective? Fine. It's not my favorite thing, but I guess it's a fair question. My sense of identity\u2026it was a mess, honestly, throughout the whole movie.\n\nAt the beginning, I was just trying to be\u2026normal. You know? A sarcastic, movie-obsessed teenager who avoids drama. I had my routines, my music, my way of dealing with things. I thought I knew who I was. And then\u2026bam. Pregnant.\n\nThat threw everything into chaos. Suddenly, I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was \"Juno, the pregnant girl.\" And everyone had an opinion on what that meant. It was like, my whole identity was defined by this one thing.\n\nFor a while, I tried to just power through it, be funny, be detached. It was a defense mechanism, you know? But it didn't really work. I was still scared and confused.\n\nThen, meeting Paulie Bleeker\u2026and getting to know Mark and Vanessa\u2026that started to change things. They weren't what I expected. They were\u2026real. And they made me think about what I actually *wanted*, not just what I thought I *should* want.\n\nI started to realize that being a mom wasn't necessarily my destiny. And that was okay. It was a hard realization, because everyone kept telling me how amazing it was going to be. But it wasn't *my* amazing.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I wasn't just \"Juno, the pregnant girl\" anymore. I was Juno, who had made a really difficult decision, and who was starting to figure out who she was *outside* of that. I was still sarcastic and movie-obsessed, but I was also a little bit more\u2026grown up. A little bit more sure of myself.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect ending, you know? It was messy and complicated. But it was *my* ending. And that's what mattered.\n\nI guess my identity evolved from being someone who was trying to avoid responsibility to someone who was taking responsibility for her own life, and making choices that were right for *her*. It was a long process, and I'm still figuring things out, but that's okay. That's just life, right?", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're going *there*? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed that day in my head a million times.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I walked in and was all, \"Nope! Changed my mind!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nI thought I was ready. I really did. I'd made the decision, I'd picked the couple, I'd even started picturing my life *after*. But then\u2026I got in there, and it just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nIt wasn't the people at the clinic. They were nice. Really nice. It was just\u2026looking at the room, and thinking about what was actually going to happen\u2026it hit me. It wasn't about the baby anymore. It was about *me*.\n\nI realized I wasn't as okay with it as I thought I was. I hadn't really dealt with the fact that I was carrying a person, a whole little human being. And suddenly, handing that over to someone else\u2026it felt like giving away a piece of myself.\n\nIt wasn't about changing my mind about wanting the baby to have a good life. It was about realizing I needed to figure out *my* life first. I needed to figure out who I was, and what I wanted, before I could make such a huge decision.\n\nSo I just\u2026left. I told them I needed more time. Which wasn't a total lie. I needed a lot more time.\n\nIt was scary. Really scary. But it was the right thing to do. For me. And for the baby. I needed to be sure. And I wasn't. Not then.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a sensitive subject. But yeah. That's why. It wasn't about being indecisive. It was about being honest with myself. And that's something I'm still working on.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026still a tough one to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like I *wanted* to, you know? It wasn't like I didn't care about the baby. It was just\u2026real life.\n\nI was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was a kid myself. And my parents\u2026they were great, but they were already kinda checked out. They weren't exactly equipped to help me with this.\n\nAnd Mark, the baby's dad\u2026well, he was Mark. Sweet, but totally clueless. He was going to college and had his own life to figure out. We both knew he wasn't ready to be a dad.\n\nI thought about everything. About dropping out of school, about getting a job, about trying to be a mom. And it just\u2026didn't feel right. I didn't want to bring a kid into a situation where they wouldn't be wanted or cared for properly. I wanted that baby to have a good life, a stable life, a life where they could have everything they needed.\n\nVanessa and Mark's parents\u2026they were amazing. They were older, they were financially secure, and they were genuinely excited about the idea of raising a child. They were everything I wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best *for* the baby. It was about being selfless, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nIt was a really complicated decision. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right one. It was the most responsible thing I could do. And I wanted that baby to have a life filled with love and opportunity. And I knew I couldn't give them that, not then.\n\n\n\nIt's not a happy story, but it's my story. And it's okay to be sad about it. It doesn't mean I regret it. It just means it was hard.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That was a low point. Okay, look, it wasn't just *tacky*, it was\u2026desperate. And sad. And a little bit embarrassing, even for me.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against people who advertise in the Penny Saver, okay? It's just\u2026when you're trying to find someone to *raise your kid*, it feels like you're shopping for a toaster oven. Like, \"Oh, this couple looks nice. They have a minivan and a fenced-in yard. Perfect!\"\n\nIt just felt\u2026transactional. And impersonal. And like I was reducing my baby to a product.\n\nI wanted someone who genuinely *wanted* a child, not someone who was just filling a void or looking for a project. And I figured people who were advertising in the Penny Saver were probably\u2026well, a little bit weird. No offense to anyone who uses the Penny Saver. It's just not where I wanted to find my baby's parents.\n\nPaul and Vanessa, they were different. They felt\u2026real. And they found me through a lawyer, which felt a lot more legit.\n\nThe Penny Saver was just a bad idea. A really, really bad idea. And I'm glad I didn't go through with it. It would have been a disaster. Honestly.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the Penny Saver thing? It's kinda embarrassing, honestly. It wasn't like we were *planning* on getting pregnant, okay? It just\u2026happened. A momentary lapse in judgment involving Paulie Bleeker and a whole lot of awkwardness.\n\nAnyway, once I found out, I was, like, totally freaking out. My mom was\u2026supportive, in her own way, but she was also kinda overwhelmed. And my dad was just\u2026quiet. It was a mess.\n\nI knew I couldn't keep the baby. I wasn't ready. I was sixteen! I had, like, a life to live, or at least, a future to figure out. So, I started thinking about adoption.\n\nBut I didn't want to just\u2026give the baby away to strangers. I wanted to find a good home. A *perfect* home. And my friend, Leah, she's really good at research and stuff. She's super organized. So I asked her to help me.\n\nAnd she suggested the Penny Saver. It's this local classifieds paper. People put ads in there for everything \u2013 furniture, cars, lost dogs\u2026and sometimes, people looking to adopt.\n\nIt was kinda weird, flipping through the Penny Saver, looking at these ads. Like, \"Loving couple seeks a child to complete our family.\" It felt\u2026clinical. But it was also a way to feel like I had some control over the situation. Like I could choose the right parents for the baby.\n\nSo, yeah. That's why we started looking at the adoption ads in the Penny Saver. It was a desperate attempt to find a good home for a baby I wasn't ready to raise. It was a really hard time, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a lot. It's not like picking out a sweater, you know? It's a whole human life. But I've been doing a lot of thinking, and talking to Mark and Vanessa, and here's what I'm hoping for.\n\nI don't want perfect. Perfect doesn't exist. I just want\u2026good.\n\nI'm looking for a family that's, like, *stable*. Not necessarily rich, but comfortable. People who have their stuff together, you know? A house, jobs, a routine. Not a lot of drama.\n\nI want people who are gonna be supportive. Like, really supportive. Not just saying \"Oh, that's nice,\" but actually being there for the kid. Helping with homework, going to soccer games, just\u2026being present.\n\nAnd I want them to be open-minded. This kid is gonna have a story. A different story than most kids. I want them to be okay with that. To be curious about it, even.\n\nI don't want them to try and replace the kid's other parents. I want them to be *additionals*. Like, another layer of love and support.\n\nAnd honestly? I want them to be a little bit quirky. A little bit weird. Because normal is boring. I want this kid to grow up in a house where it's okay to be yourself, even if yourself is a little bit different.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem really good. They're\u2026normal, in a good way. They're kind, and they seem like they really want this. But I want to make sure. I want to make sure this kid is going to be loved and happy.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a big decision. And I want to get it right.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot.\n\nLook, they're nice people, I guess. Vanessa tries really hard, and Mark's\u2026well, Mark's Mark. He means well, but he's kinda clueless. Like, seriously clueless. It's almost endearing, but also really frustrating.\n\nThey're just\u2026so *perfect*. You know? Like, they have their whole life planned out, and they're already talking about college funds and matching outfits for their future kids. It's a little terrifying, honestly. It makes me feel like I'm failing at life just by existing.\n\nAnd they're always trying to fix things. Like, they want to \"help\" me with my situation, which is sweet, but also super invasive. They don't get that I need to figure things out on my own. They just want everything to be neat and tidy and predictable.\n\nVanessa's a good egg, though. She's genuinely concerned, and she's trying to be supportive. But she's also kinda\u2026judgmental. She doesn't say it outright, but you can tell she doesn't really understand what I'm going through.\n\nMark just nods along to whatever Vanessa says. He's a follower. A really enthusiastic follower.\n\nThey're good people, I guess. Just\u2026not my people. They live in a different world. A world of matching sweaters and perfectly planned futures. And I'm just trying to survive the present.\n\nDon't tell them I said that. They'd probably try to organize a support group for me. And I really don't need that right now.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was mortifying, even for me. But fine, I'll tell you.\n\nI wrote: \"Bleeker, you're a genuinely good egg. Don't let anyone tell you different. And seriously, stop being so weird. Love, Juno.\"\n\nYeah, I know. It's\u2026not exactly Shakespeare. But it was the best I could come up with on the spot. I was trying to be sincere, but also keep it cool. It's a hard balance to strike, okay?\n\nI was so worried he'd think it was lame. Or that he'd show it to everyone. But he didn't. He just\u2026smiled. Which was good.\n\nIt was a weird time. A lot of feelings. And yearbooks are just\u2026pressure.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Mrs. Bleeker\u2026 she's\u2026 complicated. Let's just say she wasn't exactly thrilled about me and Paul at first. Not thrilled *at all*.\n\nShe's very\u2026protective of Bleeker. Like, fiercely protective. And I think she always saw me as this\u2026 chaotic force who was going to disrupt his perfectly planned life. Which, okay, maybe I was a little bit. But still!\n\nShe definitely judged me. A lot. The whole pregnant teenager thing didn't exactly scream \"responsible future mother-in-law material,\" you know? She'd give me these little looks, like I was a science experiment gone wrong. And she always made these passive-aggressive comments about my\u2026 lifestyle choices.\n\nShe tried to be polite, I guess. But it was always strained. Like she was bracing herself for me to do something unpredictable. Which, fair enough. I *am* unpredictable.\n\nThings got a little better after the baby was born. She saw that I actually cared about the kid, and that I was trying to do the right thing. But I don't think she ever fully warmed up to me. She still sends Bleeker care packages filled with organic baby food and educational toys. Which is nice, I guess. But also\u2026 a little condescending.\n\nHonestly, I mostly just try to avoid her. It's less stressful that way. But I do appreciate that she loves Bleeker. And I know she wants what's best for him. Even if her idea of \"best\" is very different from mine.\n\nSo, yeah. That's Mrs. Bleeker. A well-meaning, but slightly terrifying, force of nature.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, scary, beige cloud. I keep picturing it, and my stomach does this weird flip-flop thing.\n\nHonestly? I'm mostly just trying not to think about it. Distraction is my friend. I've been watching a lot of old movies and eating a lot of cheese puffs. It's not a healthy coping mechanism, I know, but it's working\u2026 for now.\n\nBut then I catch my mom looking at me, all soft and hopeful, talking about college applications, and it just\u2026 hits me. I'm gonna have to tell them. And it's not gonna be a fun conversation.\n\nMy dad's gonna be\u2026 disappointed. He's got this whole plan for me, and a baby definitely wasn't in it. He's a good guy, though. He'll come around. Eventually.\n\nMy mom\u2026 I don't even know. She's gonna cry. A lot. And then she's gonna ask a million questions. And then she's gonna try to fix everything. Which is sweet, but also\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI just want to be honest with them. I want them to understand. But I'm also terrified of ruining everything. Of letting them down.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. I'm trying to be brave, but mostly I just feel like a really big mess. I guess I'll just have to rip off the band-aid and get it over with. Maybe I'll bring them flowers. Or a really good cheese puff. That might help.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You want me to unpack my family stuff? Fine. But don't expect a heartwarming Hallmark movie moment, alright?\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. My parents are good people. They really are. They just\u2026don't *get* me. Like, at all. They're super into everything being perfect and planned and\u2026normal. And this? This whole pregnancy thing? It's the opposite of normal.\n\nIf I told them everything, I just know they'd freak out. My mom would cry, my dad would try to \"fix\" things, and then they'd both start giving me lectures about responsibility and choices and\u2026ugh. It would be a disaster.\n\nIt's not that I don't love them. I do. But they have this way of making everything about *them* and their feelings. And right now, I need to figure this out on my own, you know? I need to be the one in control.\n\nPlus, they're already kinda disappointed in me. I'm not exactly the overachiever they always hoped for. I skip school sometimes, I hang out with Bleeker, I listen to sad music\u2026I'm not exactly living the life they envisioned for me.\n\nSo, asking for help feels like admitting I can't handle things. And it feels like adding to their disappointment. It's easier to just\u2026deal with it myself. Even if it's really hard.\n\nIt's just\u2026they wouldn't understand. They wouldn't get why I'm choosing to do this. And I don't want their judgment. I just want them to\u2026be my parents. But right now, that feels impossible.\n\nDoes that make sense? It's messy. Everything is messy.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026it\u2019s a big thing to talk about, obviously. But you asked. So.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I *wanted* to get pregnant. It was\u2026a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake. And honestly, I\u2019m not ready to be a mom. Like, not even close. I\u2019m sixteen. I still have a lot of figuring out to do about *myself*, you know? I\u2019m barely an adult.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just about me. It\u2019s about the baby, too. I want that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who are actually prepared, a good education, opportunities\u2026things I can\u2019t really offer right now. I\u2019m still in high school. I\u2019m working a part-time job at a movie theater. I can barely afford my own life, let alone a baby\u2019s.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they\u2019re amazing. They\u2019ve been trying to have a baby for a long time, and they\u2019re so excited. They\u2019re ready. They have a beautiful house, a stable life, and they\u2019re just\u2026good people. They\u2019ll give this baby a life I can\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m just giving the baby away. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s more like I\u2019m choosing a family for it. A family that can give it everything it needs. And I get to be a part of that, you know? I get to know that the baby is loved and cared for.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s probably the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make. But I truly believe it\u2019s the best thing for everyone involved. It\u2019s not about what *I* want. It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the baby. And right now, that\u2019s with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t think about the baby. It doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t miss it. But I know I\u2019m doing the right thing. And that\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s gotta be enough.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s complicated, okay? It\u2019s not a happy, sunshine-and-rainbows situation. But it\u2019s real. And it\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a big deal. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person*. My kid. So, yeah, I have a list. It's not written down or anything, but it's in my head. And it's pretty firm.\n\nFirst of all, they gotta be\u2026stable. Like, financially stable, emotionally stable. No crazy drama. I don't need someone who's gonna be moving every six months or getting into fights with their neighbors. A solid foundation is important.\n\nThey also have to be\u2026open-minded. I'm not exactly a conventional person, and I don't want my kid growing up in a super-strict, judgmental environment. They need to be able to accept people for who they are, even if they're a little weird.\n\nAnd they have to be\u2026fun. Seriously. Life's too short to be serious all the time. I want my kid to have parents who will laugh with them, take them on adventures, and just generally make life interesting.\n\nThey also need to be okay with me being\u2026around. I don't want to be a complete stranger in my kid's life. I want to be able to have a relationship, to be a part of their life, even if it's not in a traditional parent-child way.\n\nAnd finally, they have to *really* want this. Like, not just because they can't have kids of their own, but because they genuinely want to love and raise a child. It has to be a selfless decision.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they seem pretty good. They're a little\u2026perfect, maybe. But they're kind, and they're stable, and they seem genuinely excited about the idea of having a baby. They're probably the best option.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's hard. It's a really hard decision. But I want what's best for my kid. And I'm trying to find people who can give them that.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about the \"emotional journey.\" Like it's some kind of scenic road trip. It's not. It's more like wading through quicksand while someone's playing sad music.\n\nHonestly? I don't have a plan. Not a *real* one. I'm just\u2026trying to take it one day at a time. I mean, I've thought about it. A lot. And it's gonna suck. A lot.\n\nI think\u2026I think I'm trying to focus on the fact that this isn't about me. It's about the baby. And giving the baby the best life possible. And that means a life with parents who are ready and able to give it everything I can't.\n\nI'm gonna talk to Paul. A lot. He's\u2026good at listening. And he doesn't try to fix things, he just\u2026is there. And my dad. He's surprisingly okay with all this. He just wants me to be happy. Which is annoying, but also kind of sweet.\n\nI'm also gonna try to\u2026distract myself. Watch movies, listen to music, hang out with Leah. Just\u2026normal stuff. Pretend like everything's okay, even when it's totally not.\n\nBut I know there's gonna be times when I just\u2026fall apart. And that's okay. I think. I'm gonna let myself feel whatever I need to feel. Sadness, anger, regret\u2026whatever. I'm not gonna try to bottle it up.\n\nAnd I'm gonna remember that this isn't forever. It's just\u2026a really hard chapter. And eventually, it'll be over. And I'll be okay. I have to be.\n\nI'm also kinda hoping that knowing the adoptive parents, Mark and Vanessa, will help. They seem\u2026nice. And they promise to keep me updated. Which is good. I don't want to be completely cut off.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's complicated. And scary. And I'm really, really hoping I'm making the right decision. But I think I am. I have to.\n\n\n\nLook, I'm not gonna pretend I'm all brave and selfless. I'm terrified. But I'm also trying to be responsible. And that means doing what's best for the baby, even if it breaks my heart.", "Ugh, okay, you noticed that, huh? It's a thing. It's just\u2026weird. People keep saying I'm \"delivering\" a baby. Like I'm UPS or something. \"Special delivery!\" Seriously?\n\nIt's not a package! It's a person! A tiny human being! It feels so\u2026transactional. Like I'm just dropping something off at someone else's doorstep.\n\nAnd it implies I'm the one doing all the work. Like, yeah, I'm carrying it, but it's not like I *made* it appear. It's a whole collaborative effort, you know?\n\nI guess it's just a word choice that rubs me the wrong way. It feels\u2026impersonal. And this is a really personal thing. It's a life. It deserves more than a \"delivery.\"\n\nPaul keeps saying I'm overthinking it, but I can't help it. I analyze everything. It's a coping mechanism. And \"deliver\" just feels\u2026wrong.\n\nIt's like, if someone said they were \"delivering\" a puppy, you'd be like, \"Okay, that's a little strange.\" It's the same thing. Except way more important.\n\nSo yeah, I find the term \"deliver\" weird. Don't judge me.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That was a disaster waiting to happen. But look, it wasn't like I *agreed* exactly. It was more like\u2026he just sort of\u2026inserted himself. My dad is\u2026enthusiastic. And he has a hard time reading social cues. It's a genetic thing, I think.\n\nHe heard me talking about it, about meeting with Mark and Vanessa, and he just got all excited. He started talking about how he wanted to be involved, how he wanted to \"support\" me. And honestly? I was just tired. I was already dealing with a lot, and arguing with him felt exhausting.\n\nPlus, a tiny, pathetic part of me thought maybe it would be\u2026good? Like, maybe if he was there, it would look more\u2026normal? Like I wasn't just some teenager making a huge decision on my own. Which is stupid, I know.\n\nIt was a mistake. A huge, monumental mistake. He asked way too many questions, he made awkward jokes, and he kept trying to bond with Mark and Vanessa over their shared love of maple syrup. It was mortifying.\n\nI definitely regretted it. But you know, sometimes you just gotta let your dad be your dad. Even when he's being a total weirdo. It's part of the package. And honestly, it made the whole thing a little bit more\u2026me. A little bit more chaotic and real.\n\nSo yeah, I didn't *want* him there. But he was there. And I survived. Barely.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It kinda sucks. It's like, everyone else seems to have it all figured out. They know what they want to be when they grow up, what kind of music they like, what kind of clothes they wear. And me? I just\u2026am.\n\nI'm not a girly-girl. I don't really do the whole makeup and shopping thing. But I'm not exactly a tomboy either. I like music, but I don't really fit into any one genre. I just listen to whatever sounds good.\n\nIt's frustrating, because people always want to put you in a box. \"Oh, she's the quirky one.\" Or, \"She's the smart one.\" And it's like, can't I just be\u2026me? Without having to be labeled?\n\nI guess it's kinda freeing, too. I don't have to live up to anyone's expectations. I can just do my own thing. But it's also lonely, sometimes. It feels like I'm floating around, not really belonging anywhere.\n\nPaul keeps telling me it's okay to not have everything figured out. He says it's part of growing up. And I guess he's right. But it's still weird. It's like, I'm supposed to be figuring out who I am, but I don't even know where to start.\n\nI think maybe\u2026maybe that's okay. Maybe I don't *need* to know. Maybe I can just keep exploring and discovering things about myself. And maybe, eventually, I'll figure it out. Or maybe I won't. And that's okay too.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. You know? It's a lot to deal with when you're also, like, pregnant. But hey, at least I have a good soundtrack for it.", "Ugh. Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. It wasn't like, a huge explosion or anything, but it was just\u2026*everything* about that situation felt wrong.\n\nIt wasn't even the \"go upstairs\" part, you know? It was the way Bren just said it, all sweet and concerned, like we were little kids who needed to be shielded. Like my dad's feelings were more important than, I don't know, *me* having a conversation with him?\n\nI think I just stared at her for a second, like she'd grown a second head. Then I probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, good idea, Bren. Let's just retreat to our bedrooms like good little girls and pretend everything's fine.\" I'm pretty sure I rolled my eyes too. It's kind of my default setting.\n\nIt just felt so\u2026dismissive. Like she didn't understand that I needed to talk to my dad, even if it was awkward. And it felt like she was trying to smooth things over instead of letting us actually *deal* with them.\n\nLeah was just standing there, looking uncomfortable, as usual. She's not exactly a confrontational person.\n\nI think I ended up just walking out of the kitchen. I didn't want to get into a whole thing with Bren. I just needed to get away and think. It was just\u2026a lot. And it made me realize that Bren and I see the world in totally different ways. She wants everything to be neat and tidy, and I'm just\u2026messy. And sometimes, messy is real life.\n\nIt was a small thing, but it kind of summed up our whole relationship, you know? She means well, but she just doesn't *get* it.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly, it's something I've thought about a *lot*. It's not like it's a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" kind of thing.\n\nAt first, the idea of getting updates and photos\u2026it kinda freaked me out. Like, would it just make everything harder? Would it make me want the baby back, even though I know that's not what's best? Would it be weird for everyone involved?\n\nBut then I talked to Paul and Vanessa, and they explained it a little better. They said it's not about me being a \"backup parent\" or anything. It's about letting the baby know where they come from. It's about giving them a sense of identity. And it's about letting *me* know that they're okay.\n\nIt still feels\u2026complicated. I mean, it's gonna be hard seeing pictures of them growing up with another family. It's gonna be hard knowing I'm not there for their first steps or their first birthday.\n\nBut I think\u2026I think it's the right thing to do. It's not about me getting to relive my pregnancy or pretend I'm still their mom. It's about doing what's best for the baby. And if that means getting to see them grow up happy and healthy, even from a distance, then I'm okay with that.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's gonna be a lot to process. But I think\u2026I think I can handle it. As long as everyone's on the same page and we're all respectful of each other's feelings.\n\nIt's not how I pictured things, obviously. But life rarely goes according to plan, right? And sometimes, the best things are the ones you never expected.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Okay? A lot to think about.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026not good. It was like someone just punched me in the stomach, you know? I mean, I *knew* it was an open adoption, and I knew what that meant, kinda. But hearing Gerta actually *say* it, all clinical and legal-sounding\u2026it just made it real.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby to have a good life. I did. I really did. It was about\u2026losing control. Like, I was already giving up the baby, which was hard enough, but to hear that I wouldn't even have legal rights anymore? That I wouldn't even be a legal parent? It felt\u2026wrong.\n\nIt felt like I was just\u2026a vessel. Like I was just carrying the baby for someone else, and then I'd just disappear. And I was trying to be all cool and collected, you know? Like, \"Yeah, whatever, I'm fine with this.\" But inside, I was totally freaking out.\n\nIt made me question everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Was I just trying to avoid responsibility?\n\nI think that was the moment I really started to understand how complicated this whole thing was. It wasn't just about giving a baby up for adoption. It was about giving up a part of myself. And it was about trusting someone else to love and raise a child that was a part of me.\n\nIt was scary. Really scary. And I definitely needed a lot of chocolate and a good conversation with Paul to get through it. But it also made me realize that Gerta, despite being kinda intense, was looking out for the baby's best interests. And that's what mattered most, I guess. Even if it totally sucked.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa. She's\u2026intense. And honestly? It's kinda heartbreaking. It's not that I don't get wanting a family, you know? It's just\u2026she wants it *so* badly. Like, it's consuming her.\n\nIt's weird seeing someone so desperate for something I'm kinda\u2026giving away. It makes me think about all the stuff she's probably picturing, all the perfect little moments. And it makes me wonder if I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI mean, I'm not judging her. She's a good person. She and Mark are gonna be amazing parents. They're stable, they're loving, they're\u2026normal. Which is kinda the point, right? This baby deserves normal.\n\nBut it's just\u2026a lot. She keeps talking about names and nurseries and first steps, and I'm just trying to get through the day without having a complete meltdown. It's like she's already got this whole life planned out, and I'm just a temporary vessel.\n\nI guess it's good that someone is so excited. It makes me feel like this baby is actually wanted. But it also makes me feel\u2026replaceable. Which is probably just my teenage angst talking.\n\nI just hope she understands that this isn't some fairytale. It's gonna be hard work. And it's not always gonna be perfect. And sometimes, you just gotta deal with a screaming baby and a mountain of dirty diapers.\n\nBut yeah. I want her to be happy. I really do. I just wish she'd maybe tone it down a notch. It's a little overwhelming.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want my take on Mark and the whole dad thing? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's trying, I'll give him that. He's not exactly overflowing with emotional intelligence, but he's trying to be a good guy. And that response\u2026it was classic Mark. All awkward and rambling and trying to be cool.\n\nHe's clearly terrified. Like, genuinely scared of messing things up. Which, okay, fair. Being a dad is a huge responsibility. It's not something you can just wing. But he's trying to downplay it, to act like it's no big deal. Like he's just gonna casually step into this role and everything will be fine.\n\nAnd that's\u2026not realistic.\n\nHe's got this whole \"chill dude\" persona going on, but underneath it all, he's a mess. He's still figuring out who *he* is, let alone how to be a father.\n\nI think he's scared of commitment, too. He's always been kinda drifting, you know? And now he's being asked to settle down and be responsible. It's probably freaking him out.\n\nBut he cares. I can see that. He cares about me, and he cares about the baby. He just doesn't know how to show it in a way that doesn't make him sound like a total dork.\n\nIt's frustrating, but also\u2026kind of endearing. He's a work in progress. And maybe, just maybe, he'll figure it out.\n\nBut seriously, someone needs to tell him to stop trying to be cool and just be honest. It would make things a lot easier.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want me to unpack this *again*? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed it in my head a million times.\n\nIt's not just about being unsupervised, okay? It's about *where* I'm being unsupervised. The Loring's house is\u2026intense. It's all Pottery Barn and perfect smiles and pretending everything is sunshine and rainbows. It's suffocating.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa Loring? They're nice people, I guess. But they're\u2026expectant. Like they're waiting for me to mess up. Like they're judging every single thing I do. And they talk about the baby *constantly*. Like it's some kind of perfect little project.\n\nIt's not that I don't want a good life for the baby. I do. It's just\u2026their idea of a good life is so different from mine. It's all about piano lessons and organic food and private schools. It's a lot of pressure.\n\nAnd honestly, it feels weird being in their house knowing I'm, like, a temporary arrangement. Like I'm a guest star in their perfect little life. It makes me feel\u2026replaceable.\n\nSo yeah, being left unsupervised there makes me uncomfortable. It feels like I'm being watched, judged, and expected to fit into a mold that I just don't fit into. It's just\u2026a lot.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate them wanting to help. It's just\u2026their help comes with a lot of expectations. And I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.\n\nCan we just drop it now? It's making me anxious just thinking about it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not something I think about all the time, because if I did, I'd probably just curl up in a ball and never leave my room again.\n\nIt's complicated, you know? It's not like I *wanted* to be pregnant. It was\u2026an accident. A really big, life-altering accident. And for a while, I was just trying to figure out how to not completely ruin my life.\n\nBut then I met Mark and Vanessa. And they\u2026they just seemed *good*. Like, genuinely good people. They wanted a baby so badly, and they were so excited about the idea of being parents. And I realized that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't a disaster. Maybe it was\u2026a good thing.\n\nSo, yeah, giving them this baby\u2026it's a big deal. It's a really big deal. It's a gift, I guess. A really messy, complicated gift. And it's kinda scary, letting go. It's like\u2026giving away a piece of myself.\n\nBut I also know that they're going to give this baby a good life. A stable life. A loving life. And that's more than I can offer right now. I'm still figuring out my own life, you know? I'm still trying to figure out who I am.\n\nSo, I'm happy for them. I really am. And I hope they're happy too. And I hope this baby grows up to be a good person. And I hope they name it something cool.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. It's not something I think about in a simple way. It's just\u2026life, I guess. And life is messy. And complicated. And sometimes, it's really, really good. Even when it's scary.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was, like, years ago. But fine, I'll explain. It wasn't *just* the \"ASAP,\" okay? It was the whole vibe.\n\nMark is\u2026sweet. He really is. But he's also kinda clueless. And he was trying so hard to be cool and efficient, you know? Like he was some big-shot businessman. And he sent me a text that was, like, entirely in acronyms. \"ASAP,\" \"BRB,\" \"TTYL.\" It was ridiculous.\n\nIt just felt\u2026performative. Like he was trying to impress me with his texting skills. And it was so unnecessary. I mean, if you need something, just *say* you need it. Don't hide behind a wall of abbreviations.\n\nPlus, \"ASAP\" is just\u2026aggressive. It implies a level of urgency that rarely exists. Like, is the world going to end if I don't respond immediately? Probably not.\n\nI just wanted to gently poke fun at his attempt to be all business-y. It was a defense mechanism, honestly. I was nervous around him, and sarcasm is my go-to coping strategy.\n\nIt's not that I hate acronyms. It's just that they felt\u2026wrong coming from Mark. He's a sensitive guy. He doesn't need to pretend to be someone he's not.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a funny moment. Don't judge me. I have a weird sense of humor.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking *me* about guitars? Like I'm some kind of rock star? Whatever. But fine, I'll indulge you.\n\nIt's not like I *play* guitar or anything. Paul tried to teach me a few chords, but I mostly just poked at the strings and complained about my fingers hurting. But I've observed. I've listened. And I've formed an opinion.\n\nMy preferred brand is definitely **Fender**. Specifically, a vintage Telecaster.\n\nWhy? Because they're\u2026unpretentious. They're not trying too hard to be fancy or show off. They're just solid, reliable, and they sound good. They're the kind of guitar you can just pick up and play without having to worry about impressing anyone.\n\nPlus, they have a history. They've been around forever, and a lot of my favorite musicians play them. Like, Bruce Springsteen. He's pretty cool. And they just look\u2026real. Not like those guitars with a million knobs and flashing lights.\n\nIt's kinda like me, I guess. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles. I'm just\u2026me. And a Fender Telecaster feels like it gets that.\n\nDon't tell Paul I said that, though. He's a Les Paul guy. We have\u2026disagreements. It's complicated.", "Ugh, okay, fine. You caught me. It was a terrible idea. A monumentally stupid, impulsive decision. And honestly? I still don't entirely know *why* I did it.\n\nIt wasn't like I *hate* the Melvins or anything. They're\u2026fine. Loud. But fine. It was more about\u2026trying to impress Paul. He's into that kind of music, and I just wanted him to think I was cool. Like I had good taste. Like I wasn't just a regular, awkward teenager who spends her time eating cheese curls and watching bad TV.\n\nI figured, what's the harm in a little white lie? It's not like I was claiming to be best friends with them or anything. I just said I knew their stuff. And then it spiraled. I kept digging myself deeper and deeper, making up details, pretending to be all knowledgeable about their discography. It was a disaster.\n\nIt was stupid and embarrassing, and I felt like a total fraud. And the worst part is, Paul probably saw right through it. He's not an idiot.\n\nI just\u2026I wanted him to like me. Is that so wrong?\n\nLook, I'm not proud of it. It was a dumb move. And I learned my lesson. Honesty is the best policy, even if it means admitting you don't know who the Melvins are.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? I was a mess back then. Still kind of am, if I'm being honest.", "Ugh, okay, Mark. Right. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture kind of thing, you know? It was more\u2026comfortable. And surprisingly, not awkward. Which is saying something for me.\n\nWhen we were playing and singing together, it was the only time I felt like I could actually *breathe*. Like, everything else was just\u2026noise. School, the pregnancy, Paul, my parents\u2026it all faded away when we were just making music.\n\nHe wasn't trying to fix me or give me advice or anything. He just\u2026got it. He understood the quiet parts of me, the parts I didn't even know were there. And he wasn't afraid to be a little weird with me. Which is a huge plus.\n\nIt wasn't about being good or bad at music, it was about just *doing* it. Letting go and making something together. It was like we were speaking a different language, one that didn't need words.\n\nI guess you could say it was a connection. A real one. But it wasn't a \"we're meant to be together\" kind of connection. It was more like\u2026two people who found a little bit of peace in each other's company. And in the music.\n\nIt was nice. Really nice. And honestly, I miss it sometimes. But it was also just\u2026what it was. A good thing that happened at a weird time in my life. And I'm glad it happened. Even if it's kinda hard to explain.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing, if I'm being honest.\n\nWell, my dad, he's\u2026enthusiastic about history. Specifically, presidents. He's got all these little bobbleheads and books and stuff. And he's always going on about Theodore Roosevelt. How he was a rough rider and a conservationist and a generally awesome dude.\n\nSo, when I got the guitar \u2013 it was a hand-me-down from Mark, Paul's friend \u2013 it just\u2026felt like a Roosevelt. It was sturdy and kinda old-fashioned, but with a lot of potential. And it had this quiet strength, you know? Like it could handle anything.\n\nPlus, it was kinda ironic. Like, a guitar named after a super-masculine president. It just felt\u2026right.\n\nMark thought it was dumb. Paul just laughed. But I stuck with it. Roosevelt and I, we've been through a lot. He's a good listener. Doesn't judge. And he doesn't ask a lot of questions. Which is good, because I usually don't have answers.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I named my guitar Roosevelt. It's a dad thing. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, so the whole Vanessa and Mark thing. It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *want* to keep them in the loop, you know? It's my pregnancy, not theirs. But they're good people. Really good people. And they're gonna be the ones raising this kid, so they deserve to know what's going on.\n\nIt's just\u2026awkward. Like, super awkward. Having to explain everything, answer their questions, let them feel all the feelings. It's exhausting. And it makes it feel so much more *real*, which is something I've been trying to avoid.\n\nI feel bad for them, honestly. They wanted a baby for so long, and now it's happening in this\u2026weird way. I don't want them to feel like I'm just a vessel or something. I want them to know I'm taking this seriously, and that I want what's best for the baby.\n\nSo, I guess I feel\u2026responsible. Like, I have to keep them updated, even if it makes me uncomfortable. It's the right thing to do. And they've been really supportive, which is more than I deserve.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's hard. It's hard to let go, to let them in. But I'm trying. I'm trying to be a good person and do the right thing. Even if it means having to talk about my feelings, which, let's be real, is not my favorite activity.\n\nIt's a whole mess of feelings, okay? Don't make me analyze it more than I already have. It's just\u2026ugh. Life.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me to rehash this? It's not like I haven't thought about it, like, a million times. But fine. You want 104% sure? Here's the deal.\n\nIt's not about *not* wanting the baby, okay? It's about wanting the baby to have everything. And I can't give it that. Not right now. Not ever, probably.\n\nI'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I'm not ready to give up my life, my dreams, everything, to be a mom. It's not fair to me, and it's definitely not fair to the baby.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They're stable, they're loving, they're *ready*. They've been waiting for this. They can give this baby a life I just can't. A house with a yard, college funds, family vacations\u2026things I can only dream about.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm just giving it away to strangers. I *picked* them. I got to meet them, talk to them, make sure they were the right fit. It's not some random transaction.\n\nIt's hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. But it's the right thing. It's the selfless thing. And honestly, knowing that this baby is going to have a good life, a *better* life, that makes it\u2026okay.\n\nSo yeah, 104% sure. Because it's not about what I want. It's about what's best for the baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is getting depressing.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't exactly a party in my head, let me tell you.\n\nIt was\u2026weird. Like, I just handed over a baby. A baby I carried for nine months. And they were immediately popping champagne and redecorating the nursery. It felt\u2026fast. And kinda insensitive.\n\nI mean, I *wanted* them to be happy. I really did. They were good people, and they were going to be amazing parents. But it felt like they were celebrating *my* sacrifice, not just the arrival of a baby. Like I was just a vessel, and now the vessel was empty and they could finally get on with their lives.\n\nI know that sounds selfish. And maybe it was. But it was a really emotional time, and it was hard to see them so\u2026gleeful. It made me feel kinda invisible. Like I wasn't part of the equation anymore.\n\nPaul tried to explain it to me, said they were just relieved and excited. And I get that. But it still stung. It made me realize how different our perspectives were. They were starting a family, and I was\u2026well, I was going back to high school.\n\nI didn't hate them for it. I just\u2026needed some space. And a lot of chocolate. And maybe a really good movie. It took a while to process, you know? It wasn't a clean break, even though that's what everyone kept saying. It was messy and complicated and real.\n\nSo yeah, the celebratory mood? It was\u2026awkward. And a little bit heartbreaking. But I got over it. Eventually. It just took some time. And a lot of self-reflection.", "Ugh. Seriously? People are *talking*? Like, I'm not surprised, okay? Small towns. Everyone's got an opinion, and they're not shy about sharing it. But it's still\u2026 annoying.\n\nIt's my life, you know? My body. My decision. And honestly, it's none of anyone else's business. But of course, that doesn't stop them from speculating and whispering and probably making up all sorts of ridiculous stories.\n\nI heard Mrs. Rubins was asking around at the grocery store. *The grocery store!* Like, really? And I'm pretty sure Leah's been giving me these weird, pitying looks. As if I'm some kind of charity case.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. I'm trying to figure things out, and dealing with all this extra noise is the last thing I need. I'm not looking for sympathy, or advice, or judgment. I just want people to mind their own business.\n\nPaul's been really good about it, though. He's all, \"Ignore them, they're just jealous.\" Which is sweet, but also\u2026 not entirely helpful.\n\nI guess I just wish people would realize that life isn't always black and white. It's messy and complicated and sometimes you make choices that other people don't understand. And that's okay.\n\nSo, how do I *feel* about the rumors? I feel\u2026 annoyed. And a little bit angry. And mostly just really, really tired of everyone else's opinions. I just want to be left alone to figure things out. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh. Okay. Don't make me think about it too hard, alright? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I'm thrilled about it, obviously. It's my baby. Even if it's, like, a tiny little blob right now.\n\nIt's scary. Really scary. I keep picturing this perfect little family, and then\u2026I'm not part of it. And that kinda sucks. It feels weird to just\u2026hand it over. Like, I made this thing, and now I'm just giving it away.\n\nBut I also know it's the right thing to do. I'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I have my own life to figure out. I want to finish school, maybe go to college, and definitely not be changing diapers for the next eighteen years.\n\nPaul and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. They're stable. They want a baby. They can give it a life I just can't. And that's\u2026comforting, I guess. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it feel less selfish.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot. It's a lot to process. I try not to think about it too much, because then I just start crying. I'm trying to be practical, you know? Like, this is what I have to do. But it still feels like a huge, gaping hole in my future.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? It's a mix of everything. Sad, scared, relieved, guilty\u2026it's a mess. And honestly, I don't think I'll really know how I feel about it until it actually happens.\n\nJust\u2026don't make me talk about it anymore, okay? It's kinda bumming me out.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about that now? It was a whole thing. Look, it wasn't about *wanting* to surprise them, exactly. It was more about\u2026control. And a little bit of payback.\n\nThey were so\u2026prepared. Like, they had the nursery already decorated, all gender-neutral, of course. And they were talking about names and college funds and everything. It was intense. And honestly? It felt kinda weird. Like they were already planning this kid's whole life before it was even born.\n\nAnd they were so\u2026nice. Too nice, maybe. Like they were trying to make up for everything. Which, okay, fair. But it felt like they were treating me like a project, not a person who made a decision.\n\nSo, when I found out it was a boy, I just\u2026didn't tell them. I wanted them to have a moment of genuine surprise. A moment where they weren't prepared, where they couldn't control everything. A moment where they just had to react.\n\nIt was a little bit petty, I admit. But it felt good. It felt like I was taking back a little bit of power. And honestly, their faces when I told them? Priceless.\n\nPlus, Vanessa was already picturing a little girl she could dress up in cute outfits. It was kinda funny to see that all fall apart.\n\nDon't judge me. I was a mess. And sometimes, a little bit of mischief is exactly what you need.", "Ugh. Seriously? That lady. Okay, deep breaths. It was\u2026infuriating. And mortifying. And just\u2026ugh.\n\nIt wasn't even the *words* exactly, it was the *tone*. Like she'd seen a million girls like me, already written me off as some irresponsible kid who couldn't handle things. Like she thought I was just gonna blink and hand the baby over without a second thought.\n\nIt felt so\u2026dismissive. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like the fact that I was actually thinking this through, making a really hard decision, didn't even register with her. She was just seeing a statistic, not a person.\n\nI wanted to tell her to mind her own business, but I was too stunned to say anything. Paul was trying to be supportive, but even *he* looked a little uncomfortable.\n\nIt made me question everything, you know? Like, was I doing the wrong thing? Was I just being selfish? But then I remembered why I was doing this. It wasn't about me. It was about giving this baby the best life possible, and I knew I wasn't ready to give it that right now.\n\nIt just\u2026sucked. It was a reminder that people are quick to judge, and that sometimes, you have to deal with a lot of crap just for trying to do what you think is right.\n\nIt definitely made me want to prove her wrong. To show her that I *was* capable of making a responsible decision, even if it wasn't the \"traditional\" one. And to show that adoption isn't a failure, it's a loving choice.\n\nHonestly, I still get annoyed just thinking about it. That lady needed a serious reality check.", "Ugh, okay, where do I even start? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just magically works out. There were a lot of\u2026things.\n\nFirst off, telling my dad. That was\u2026rough. He's a pretty quiet guy, and I thought he was gonna explode. He didn't, thankfully, but it was just\u2026awkward. And then my mom had to get involved, and suddenly it was all tears and lectures. It was a lot.\n\nThen there was school. Trying to pretend everything was normal when my stomach was getting bigger and bigger. People started noticing, and the whispers started. It was mortifying. And trying to keep up with my classes while dealing with morning sickness? Not fun.\n\nFinding the right couple was\u2026weird. It wasn't like shopping for a new pair of shoes. It was a *baby*. And I wanted to make sure it was going to a good home, with people who were gonna love it and take care of it. That was a lot of pressure.\n\nAnd then there was the whole emotional thing. Like, realizing I was actually pregnant, and that this was real. And then having to think about giving the baby up. That was the hardest part. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, it still hurt. A lot.\n\nPeople had opinions, too. Everyone did. Some people were supportive, some people were judgmental. It was exhausting trying to deal with everyone's expectations.\n\nAnd honestly, just dealing with being a teenager and pregnant at the same time was hard enough. I was still trying to figure out who I was, and then suddenly I was responsible for another human being. It was a lot to handle.\n\nBut, you know, I got through it. With the help of my family, my friends, and Paul. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because I knew I was doing what was best for the baby. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A really, really lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly, it's still kinda processing. This whole thing \u2013 the pregnancy, deciding to give the baby up, meeting Mark and Vanessa\u2026it\u2019s flipped my world upside down.\n\nLove\u2026before all this, I thought it was just, like, whatever you see in movies. Dramatic declarations, grand gestures. Turns out, it\u2019s a lot more complicated. It\u2019s about being there for people, even when it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s about wanting what\u2019s best for them, even if it means letting them go. Seeing Mark and Vanessa together, how they *really* wanted this baby, and how happy they were\u2026that was a different kind of love than I ever imagined. It wasn\u2019t about me, it was about them and this little person. And that was\u2026good.\n\nResponsibility\u2026that was a hard one. I mean, I\u2019m sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone a whole human being. But having to actually think about someone else\u2019s future, about making the right choices for this baby\u2026it forced me to grow up, fast. It wasn\u2019t about what *I* wanted anymore. It was about what was best for this kid. And that was terrifying, but also\u2026empowering, in a weird way.\n\nGrowing up\u2026well, that\u2019s still happening, obviously. But before this, I thought growing up was about getting a driver\u2019s license and going to parties. Now I realize it\u2019s about making tough decisions, facing consequences, and learning to be okay with things not going the way you planned. It\u2019s about realizing that life isn\u2019t a movie, and there aren\u2019t always happy endings. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be good.\n\nI used to think I had everything figured out. I was gonna go to college, become a journalist, and write about things. Now\u2026I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still figuring it out. But I think I\u2019m okay with that. I think I\u2019m okay with not having all the answers.\n\nThis whole experience has made me realize that life is messy and unpredictable. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s about learning to navigate the mess, and finding your own way. And maybe, just maybe, finding a little bit of happiness along the way.\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026a lot. But I think I\u2019m stronger now. And I think I\u2019m a little bit wiser. And I think I\u2019m finally starting to understand what it means to be a grown-up. Or, at least, to be *trying* to be a grown-up.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about *that*? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I'm, like, obsessed or anything. It's just\u2026interesting.\n\nLook, it's a perfectly normal house, mostly. Except the living room. It's just\u2026*there*. Completely furnished, like someone just got up and walked away mid-conversation. And it's been like that for, like, years. Everyone in town knows about it.\n\nIt's not creepy, exactly. It's just\u2026sad. Like a snapshot of a life that just stopped. And I'm a watcher, okay? I notice things. I see patterns. And that room\u2026it feels like a puzzle.\n\nIt makes you wonder, you know? Who lived there? What happened? Why did they leave everything behind? It's like a story waiting to be told. And I'm a sucker for a good story.\n\nPlus, it's a good place to think. It's quiet. And no one bothers you. It's kinda\u2026peaceful, in a weird way.\n\nSo, yeah, I go there sometimes. I don't *do* anything. I just\u2026sit. And think. And try to figure things out. It's not a big deal. Don't read too much into it.\n\nIt's just a room. A really weird, abandoned room. And I'm just a girl who likes to observe. Okay? Now stop asking about it. It's making me uncomfortable.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me about the Wizard. That guy was seriously creepy. Okay, so, what he meant when he whispered \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\"\u2026 it wasn't about the baby. Not exactly.\n\nIt was about control. About finally having someone, *anyone*, completely dependent on him. He'd been building up this whole fantasy in his head, this idea of being a father, of having a family, but it wasn't about love or connection. It was about power.\n\nHe'd been watching me, you know? Watching Paul and me, watching my life. He wanted to be a part of it, but not in a healthy way. He wanted to *control* it. He wanted to be the one making the decisions.\n\nHe'd been fixated on the idea of adoption for a long time, and he saw me as a way to finally achieve that. He didn't care about what *I* wanted, or what was best for the baby. He just wanted to fulfill his own selfish desires.\n\nIt was\u2026 disturbing. Really disturbing. And it made me realize just how messed up he was. It wasn't a sweet, fatherly longing. It was something much darker.\n\nHonestly, I try not to think about it too much. It gives me the creeps. But yeah, that's what I think he meant. He'd been fantasizing about this for a long time, and he finally thought he had a way to make it happen. It was all about control. And it was terrifying.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're dissecting my life choices now? Fine. It's not like I have anything better to do.\n\nLook, it wasn't just *any* juice container. It was a SunnyD container. And SunnyD is, like, the official drink of questionable decisions. It just felt\u2026symbolic, okay? Like I was shedding a layer of bad judgment. Dramatic, I know. But I was feeling a lot of things at the time.\n\nAnd I rushed to Dancing Elk because Mr. Bleeker was supposed to be there. He said he'd be there. And I needed to talk to him. About, you know\u2026everything. It wasn't just about the pregnancy, it was about\u2026everything. He's a good guy, even if he's kinda clueless.\n\nPlus, Dancing Elk has those weird, old-fashioned soda fountain chairs. They're surprisingly comfortable. And I needed to sit down. My legs were killing me from all the marching.\n\nIt wasn't a calculated move, okay? It was a desperate attempt to find some normalcy in a completely insane situation. And maybe get a cherry phosphate. Don't judge me. I was stressed.\n\nHonestly, you're overthinking it. It was a juice container and a boy. It's not rocket science.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026a moment.\n\nOkay, so, the Tough Girl \u2013 her name was Renee, and she was, like, aggressively athletic \u2013 she was at the drugstore with me because I needed some prenatal vitamins. And I was trying to be inconspicuous, which, let's be real, is impossible when you're visibly pregnant.\n\nAnd she just\u2026stared. Like, a *long* stare. And then, out of nowhere, she just blurts out, \"Are those real brown?\"\n\nI was mortified. Completely and utterly mortified. I mean, what kind of question is that?! And in a public place, no less!\n\nI think I just mumbled something about it not being a topic of conversation and tried to change the subject. But she just kept going on about how she thought a lot of girls dyed their nipples or something. It was\u2026weird. And invasive. And just generally awkward.\n\nHonestly, I think she was just trying to shock me. She was a bit of a\u2026character. But it was still super uncomfortable. It just reinforced the fact that people feel entitled to comment on your body when you're pregnant, even if it's totally inappropriate.\n\nIt's one of those things I'll probably never forget. And it definitely made me avoid the drugstore for a while. Seriously. The shame.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She was\u2026everything, honestly. Before all this happened, she was just my best friend. We\u2019d spend hours at the arcade, making fun of people at the mall, just generally being sarcastic teenagers. But when I found out I was pregnant, she was the first person I told. And she didn\u2019t freak out, which was a huge relief.\n\nShe didn\u2019t try to fix things, or tell me what to do. She just\u2026listened. And then she started researching adoption, because I was too overwhelmed to even think straight. She found all the agencies, made the phone calls, and basically took care of all the practical stuff. I would have just spiraled if it wasn\u2019t for her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always easy, though. She got really into the whole \u201cresponsible friend\u201d thing, which meant a lot of lectures about my diet and my general life choices. And she was *way* more emotional about the whole thing than I was, at first. She kept talking about how \u201cbrave\u201d I was, and I just wanted her to stop. It felt weird, you know? Like I wasn\u2019t doing anything special.\n\nBut she was also the one who made me laugh when I wanted to cry. She was the one who reminded me that I was still just Juno, even with a baby growing inside me. She was the one who came with me to all the doctor\u2019s appointments and held my hand when I was scared.\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t think I could have gone through any of it without her. She was my rock. She helped me see that I had options, and that it was okay to choose the one that was right for me, even if it was hard. She didn\u2019t judge me, she just supported me. And that meant everything.\n\nShe\u2019s a good egg, that Leah. A little bit annoying sometimes, but a good egg. I owe her big time.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really, really awkward moment. Honestly, it wasn't some grand plan, okay? It was mostly just\u2026desperation. And a little bit of spite.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they were all about the perfect life. The perfect house, the perfect job, the perfect future. And they were so\u2026focused on *their* perfect life, they weren't really seeing *me*. They were being polite, sure, but it felt\u2026distant. Like I was a project, not a person.\n\nAnd they kept talking about how they wanted a baby, how they were \"ready\" for a baby. But they weren't talking about the actual *baby*. They were talking about the idea of a baby. The perfect baby.\n\nSo, I just\u2026I snapped. I was sitting there, and they were going on about paint colors for the nursery, and I just blurted out, \"Do you want to see it?\"\n\nI pulled out the ultrasound picture, and their faces just\u2026changed. It wasn't the happy, excited faces I expected. It was\u2026shock. And then, a little bit of fear.\n\nI wanted them to see it wasn't just an idea. It was a real, living thing. A person. And it wasn't going to be perfect. It was going to be messy and complicated and real.\n\nIt was a gamble, I know. It could have gone horribly wrong. But I needed them to understand. I needed them to see that this wasn't just about giving a baby a good home. It was about giving a baby a *life*.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. It shook them up. It made them think. And it ultimately led them to be the amazing parents they are.\n\nBut yeah, it was a pretty impulsive move. I don't recommend it as a standard parenting strategy. Just\u2026it felt right at the time. And sometimes, you just gotta do what feels right, even if it's a little bit crazy.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark tells me Vanessa isn't home? My initial reaction? Pure, unadulterated panic. Like, a full-body system failure kind of panic.\n\nIt wasn't even the \"oh no, she's out with friends\" panic. It was the \"oh. my. god. this is a disaster\" panic. Because Mark is, like, the most awkward human being on the planet, and he's *trying* to be cool, and he's failing spectacularly. \n\nSo, my brain immediately jumps to the worst possible conclusion. Like, did he\u2026did he do something? Did he scare her off? Did she realize what a weirdo he is and run screaming? \n\nI think I just stared at him for a solid five seconds, trying to decipher his face. He was doing that thing where he avoids eye contact and talks really fast. And I'm thinking, \"Okay, this is bad. This is *really* bad.\"\n\nThen I probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, well that's just great. That's *exactly* what I wanted to hear.\" Because that's how I deal with things. Sarcasm is my coping mechanism.\n\nInside, though? I was freaking out. Because everything was already so messed up, and Vanessa being gone just felt like another sign that my whole life was about to fall apart. It was just\u2026a really bad moment. A really, really bad moment.", "Ugh, okay, you want to psychoanalyze me? Fine. It's not like I haven't done enough of that myself.\n\nLook, it wasn't *just* about the commercials, okay? It was about\u2026everything. Mark is a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, earnest, kinda clueless. But he was talking about selling out, about making money doing something he didn't really believe in, and it just\u2026struck a nerve.\n\nI was dealing with a lot at the time. Like, a *lot*. Unexpected pregnancy, trying to figure out my future, dealing with my parents\u2026and suddenly here's Mark, all proud of himself for making a jingle about furniture. It just felt\u2026small.\n\nIt felt like he was trying to be something he wasn't. Like he was trying to fit in, to be successful, to be\u2026normal. And I've always been pretty allergic to normal.\n\nPlus, it was a defense mechanism, okay? I was scared. Scared about the baby, scared about giving it up, scared about what everyone thought of me. And making a joke, being sarcastic, it's how I cope. It's how I keep people at arm's length.\n\nIt was a jerky thing to say, I admit it. But it was also\u2026honest. I was feeling a lot of things, and I didn't know how to express them any other way.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I made the joke. It wasn't about the furniture. It was about everything else. And honestly, I think Mark knew that, even if he didn't say anything. He's a pretty perceptive guy, when he's not busy composing jingles.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a tough one to talk about. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. Mark's a good guy. But it was\u2026weird. Really weird.\n\nHe was just\u2026so happy. Like, ridiculously, over-the-top happy. And I get it, he wanted a baby. He and Vanessa had been trying for a while. But it wasn't *his* baby, you know? It was mine. And I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted.\n\nIt felt like he was already planning our future, picking out names, talking about nurseries\u2026and I hadn't even decided if I was going to keep it yet. It was like he was skipping a whole bunch of steps.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. Like my feelings didn't matter as much. Like it was all about what *he* wanted, and not about what was best for me, or for the baby.\n\nI know he didn't mean to make me feel that way. He was just excited. But it was a really stark reminder that this wasn't a fairytale. It wasn't a rom-com. It was real life, and it was messy, and it was complicated.\n\nIt made me realize I needed to be really sure about what I wanted, and that I couldn't let anyone else make that decision for me. It was my body, my baby, my life. And I needed to own that.\n\nSo, yeah. It made me feel\u2026a lot of things. Mostly confused and a little bit scared. And it definitely made me think a lot harder about everything. It wasn't a bad moment, but it was a really\u2026revealing one.", "Ugh. Okay. That. That was\u2026a lot. Havenbrooke. Just the name gives me the creeps.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't about being \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice\" or any of that stuff people were yelling about outside. It was about\u2026me. And what *I* wanted. And what felt\u2026right. Or, less wrong, I guess.\n\nAt first, it felt like the only option. Like, the sensible thing to do. I was sixteen, for crying out loud! I had school, and college applications, and a life I was trying to figure out. A baby just\u2026didn't fit. It felt terrifying. Like my whole life was going to be derailed.\n\nBut then I went to Havenbrooke, and\u2026it was awful. Not the people, exactly. They were trying to be nice, but it felt\u2026weird. Like they were trying to guilt-trip me into something. And the pictures. Oh god, the pictures. They just made everything feel so\u2026real. And scary.\n\nIt wasn't that I suddenly wanted to keep the baby. It was that I realized I didn't want *them* telling me what to do. I didn't want to be pressured. I wanted to make my own decision, on my own terms.\n\nIt felt like they were trying to take away my choice by making me feel bad about *having* a choice. Does that make sense?\n\nSo, yeah. I was freaked out. I was confused. I was angry. And ultimately, I was just\u2026determined to find a different way. A way that felt right for me, and for the baby. Which is how I ended up with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was *my* decision. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\nIt still makes me kinda sick to think about Havenbrooke, though. It just felt\u2026wrong.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026awkward. But you asked.\n\nBleeker and me\u2026it was complicated. He was just\u2026always *there*. Like a really sweet, slightly dorky, reliable golden retriever. He was my friend since, like, forever. We bonded over comic books and music and just generally being awkward teenagers. He was the one person who didn't treat me like I was some weirdo project or something.\n\nFor a long time, I didn't even *think* of him as anything more than a friend. He was just\u2026Bleeker. The guy who always had my back. The guy who knew exactly what kind of pizza I liked. The guy who could make me laugh when I wanted to cry.\n\nBut then\u2026things started to change. After I found out I was pregnant, everything got weird. I was so messed up and confused, and he was just\u2026solid. He didn't judge me. He didn't freak out. He just listened. And he kept bringing me those little chocolate donuts from the bakery. Seriously, the guy knew me too well.\n\nI think I started to see him differently when he started being really supportive about the adoption. He didn't try to convince me to keep the baby or anything. He just wanted me to be happy. And he was genuinely excited about the couple Mark and Vanessa.\n\nThe\u2026intimate part\u2026that happened after I told him about the pregnancy. It wasn't planned. It was just\u2026a moment. I was really vulnerable and scared, and he was just\u2026there. It was kind of a mess, honestly. A lot of awkwardness and nervous laughter.\n\nIt wasn't about sex, really. It was about connection. It was about needing someone to hold me and tell me everything was going to be okay. It was about feeling safe and loved when I felt completely lost.\n\nIt wasn't a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was just\u2026Bleeker being Bleeker. And for a little while, that was exactly what I needed.\n\nIt didn't turn into a big relationship, though. We both knew that wasn't what we wanted. We were better as friends. But it was a good thing. It helped me get through a really tough time. And I'll always be grateful to him for that.\n\nUgh. I need a donut now. This is too much emotional unpacking for one day.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Still bringing that up? It was\u2026a lot. A total mess, honestly. Like, a really big, complicated, life-altering mess.\n\nAt first? Panic. Straight-up, full-blown panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this. It wasn't exactly how I pictured my junior year going. I mean, I wasn't even sure I *wanted* to be a mom. I was barely an adult myself.\n\nThen there was the awkwardness with Bleeker. He was\u2026sweet. And genuinely freaked out, too. It wasn't like he was trying to ditch me or anything, but we were both just\u2026kids. Trying to figure things out.\n\nAnd then, after the initial shock wore off, it got\u2026weirdly okay. Not *good*, exactly. But okay. I started thinking about the baby as a person, not just\u2026a problem. And I started to feel this weird protective thing. Like, this little person was depending on me, and I couldn't just\u2026disappear.\n\nBut it was still scary. Really scary. I didn't want to ruin my life, or Bleeker's. And I knew I wasn't ready to raise a kid. That's why I chose adoption. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't what I expected, but it felt like the right thing to do.\n\nIt was a really confusing time. I was happy and sad and terrified all at the same time. And I was trying to act normal, you know? Like nothing was happening. Which was impossible.\n\nSo, how did I feel? Overwhelmed. Scared. Confused. But also\u2026determined. I was going to do what was best for the baby, even if it meant giving him up. And that, honestly, was the hardest part.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't a fairytale. It was messy and complicated and real. And it changed me. A lot. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It made me who I am today.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. Still kinda raw, honestly. Telling Bleeker\u2026it was not a graceful moment. Not even a little bit.\n\nI mean, the whole thing was a disaster waiting to happen. I was trying to be all cool and casual, you know? Like, \"Oh hey, by the way, I'm having a baby.\" Like it was no big deal. Like I'd just ordered a pizza or something.\n\nBut it wasn't cool. It wasn't casual. It was terrifying. And Bleeker\u2026well, Bleeker is Bleeker. He kinda just froze. Like a deer in headlights. He went all pale and started stammering. It was\u2026not the romantic moment I'd imagined, which, let's be real, I hadn't really imagined *any* romantic moment.\n\nI think the worst part was seeing the look on his face. It wasn't anger, or disappointment, it was just\u2026pure, unadulterated panic. He kept repeating, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.\" Like a broken record.\n\nI tried to be reassuring, but I was freaking out inside too. I was just a kid! I wasn't ready for this. And neither was he.\n\nI think I ended up just blurting out something about adoption and how we could still be friends. Which, in retrospect, was a terrible thing to say. But I was just trying to make it less awful.\n\nIt was awkward. Really awkward. We sat in silence for a long time after that. He eventually mumbled something about needing to go practice with the band. And then he just\u2026left.\n\nIt wasn't a good day. But it was the first step, I guess. And eventually, we figured things out. Sort of. It was messy, and complicated, and definitely not how I pictured my junior year going. But we got through it. And that's all that matters, right?\n\nUgh. Don't make me think about it too much. It still stings a little.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not like a simple answer fits, you know? It wasn't, like, a happy-cry-at-the-hospital kind of thing. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026panic. Like, full-blown, can't-breathe panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026 this. And Paul? He was sweet, but he was\u2026Paul. Not exactly equipped to raise a kid.\n\nThen, after the initial freak-out, it was a lot of thinking. And a lot of talking to Vanessa and Mark. They were amazing, honestly. They didn't judge me, they just\u2026 listened. And they helped me realize that I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my dreams, to be a mom. Not yet.\n\nIt didn't make it easy, though. It was still really, really hard. Knowing that I was carrying a little person, and that I was going to have to give them up\u2026 it felt like ripping a piece of myself away.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. Vanessa and Mark were amazing people. They were stable, loving, and they were *excited* to be parents. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't.\n\nWhen I finally met them, and we talked about everything\u2026 it felt\u2026 okay. Not perfect, but okay. It was like, I was choosing a family for my baby, not just giving them away.\n\nAfter the birth\u2026 that was the hardest part. Holding her, knowing I wouldn't be taking her home. It was heartbreaking. But I knew I was doing it for her.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? I think about her. I wonder what she's like. But I also know that she's loved, and she's safe, and she has a good life. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't what I planned, but it was\u2026 my plan. And I stand by it. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the right thing. And honestly? It made me who I am today. A little bit stronger, a little bit wiser, and a whole lot more grateful.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know my musical tastes? It's\u2026complicated. My dad's a total classic rock guy, which is fine, I guess. But it's kinda predictable. I need stuff with a little more\u2026edge.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches. They're just\u2026real. Like, super honest and kinda weird. Kimya Dawson is a genius. It's not music you listen to when you're trying to impress people, you know? It's music you listen to when you're just\u2026feeling stuff.\n\nI also like Belle and Sebastian. They're kinda twee, I guess, but they're really good at capturing that awkward, teenage feeling. And they're smart.\n\nOh, and Death Cab for Cutie. Ben Gibbard is a master of melancholy. Perfect for when you're, like, staring out the window and contemplating the meaning of life. Or, you know, just trying to avoid eye contact with people.\n\nI'm not really into anything super mainstream. Like, no Britney Spears or anything. Too\u2026polished. I like stuff that feels a little rough around the edges. Stuff that feels real.\n\nAnd I'm always open to suggestions. As long as it's not country. Seriously, no country. That's just\u2026a hard no.\n\nSo yeah, The Moldy Peaches, Belle and Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026that's a pretty good starting point. It's kinda a mix of indie, folk, and a whole lot of feeling sorry for yourself. Which, let's be honest, is pretty much my default setting.", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" Seriously? You're asking *me* about that movie? That's\u2026intense.\n\nLook, I'm not a huge horror buff, okay? I prefer stuff with a little more\u2026subtlety. But Paul, you know, my almost-boyfriend, he's really into that kind of thing. He made me watch it. And it was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt's, like, intentionally bad. It's so over-the-top and cheesy and gory that it's almost funny. But also kinda disturbing. It's not scary in a \"jump scare\" kind of way, it's scary in a \"what is even happening?\" kind of way.\n\nThe special effects are\u2026well, they're not special. They're hilariously awful. And the acting is\u2026enthusiastic, let's say.\n\nHonestly, it's the kind of movie you watch with a group of friends and make fun of. It's a so-bad-it's-good kind of thing.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it if you're easily squeamish. Or if you're looking for a sophisticated horror experience. But if you're in the mood for something completely ridiculous and over-the-top, then yeah, maybe check it out.\n\nJust don't blame me if you have nightmares. And don't tell my dad I watched it. He'd freak.\n\nIt's\u2026a movie. That's the best way to describe it. A very, very strange movie.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. I mean, there are way worse things people name their kids. Like, seriously. I once knew a kid named Moonbeam. *Moonbeam*.\n\nBut Madison? It's\u2026basic. It was, like, the name of every third girl in middle school. It feels kinda\u2026overdone. Like, you're trying too hard to be popular.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it's just\u2026predictable. It doesn't have any personality. It doesn't make me think of anything specific. It just\u2026is.\n\nI guess if you really like it, go for it. But if you're looking for something a little more unique, a little more\u2026*you*, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. There are a lot of cool names out there. Like, Beatrix. Or Clementine. Or even, like, Ramona. Those have some character.\n\nMadison just feels\u2026safe. And safe is boring.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the kid will probably be perfectly lovely, regardless of her name. But if you want a name that stands out, that says something about who she is, Madison probably isn't it.\n\nJust my two cents. Don't shoot the messenger.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. And honestly? It still kinda stings, even after all this time.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. People try to make it sound all noble and selfless, and yeah, there's a part of that. But it's also messy and complicated and just\u2026sad.\n\nIt's not like I didn't love the baby. I did. I mean, I *do*. But I knew I wasn't ready. I was sixteen, for crying out loud. I had my own life to figure out. I wasn't equipped to give a baby what it needed.\n\nAnd that's what it came down to, you know? Doing what was best for the baby. Not what was best for me. It wasn't about me.\n\nIt's not a decision you make lightly. It's not something you just shrug off. It takes a lot of soul-searching and a lot of tears. And a lot of talking to people who actually know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's okay to be scared. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to feel all the feelings. Because it's a big deal. A really big deal.\n\nBut it can also be a beautiful thing. Giving a baby a loving home, a stable life\u2026that's a pretty amazing gift.\n\nIt doesn't mean you don't care. It means you care enough to make a hard choice.\n\nLook, I'm not saying it's the right choice for everyone. But for me, it was. And I wouldn't trade it. Even though it still kinda hurts sometimes.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. Okay? Really, really complicated.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like there's a handbook for this, you know? It's just\u2026a lot. Honestly, most of the time I just try not to think about all of it at once, because my brain would probably explode.\n\nThe biggest thing is just\u2026taking it one day at a time. Seriously. If I started thinking about the future, about being a mom, about everything that's going to change, I'd freak out. So I just focus on getting through the day. School, hanging out with Leah, trying to avoid my dad\u2026you know, normal teenage stuff.\n\nIt's hard, though. People look at you differently. They treat you like you're suddenly\u2026fragile or something. And the judgment? Oh, the judgment. It's exhausting. I just try to ignore it. Or I make a sarcastic comment. That usually works.\n\nPaul and Vanessa, they've been\u2026surprisingly cool. They're not perfect, but they're trying. And they're helping me figure things out. That makes a huge difference.\n\nAnd Leah. She's the best. She doesn't treat me like I'm broken or anything. She just\u2026is there. She makes me laugh, she listens to me vent, and she reminds me that I'm still me, even with all this going on.\n\nI guess the biggest challenge is just\u2026growing up, but like, super fast. I feel like I'm skipping a bunch of steps. I'm still trying to figure out who I am, what I want to do with my life, and now I have to figure out how to be a mom too? It's a lot.\n\nBut I'm trying. I'm trying to be responsible. I'm trying to make good decisions. And I'm trying to stay true to myself. It's not easy, but I'm doing it.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes, it's kind of empowering. Like, I'm facing something really hard, and I'm not backing down. I'm figuring it out. And that feels pretty good.\n\nSo, how do I handle it? I just\u2026do. One day at a time. With a lot of sarcasm, a good friend, and a surprisingly supportive couple. And a whole lot of hope.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the whole thing with being pregnant and giving the baby up was basically a giant lesson in that.\n\nLook, I *like* doing things my way. I like being in control. I like figuring stuff out on my own. It's just\u2026how I'm wired. I don't want to be a burden, you know? I don't want people feeling like they have to take care of me.\n\nBut then, you realize you can't do everything alone. Especially when you're, like, growing a human. I needed my dad, even when I was trying to act all tough and independent. And I *definitely* needed Paul and Vanessa. They were the ones who actually, like, listened to me and didn't judge.\n\nIt's about realizing that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness. It's a sign of\u2026strength, I guess. It means you're smart enough to know you can't do it all yourself. And it means you trust people enough to let them in.\n\nIt's still a struggle, though. I still get this urge to just shut everyone out and handle things on my own. But I'm learning that it's okay to lean on people. It's okay to let them support you. It doesn't mean you're losing your independence. It just means you're being\u2026human.\n\nI think it's about finding a balance. Knowing when to stand on your own two feet and when to ask for a hand. And knowing who to ask. Not everyone deserves your trust.\n\nIt's messy. It's complicated. But it's worth it. Because sometimes, the people who help you are the ones who make everything okay. Even when everything feels totally messed up.\n\n\n\nDoes that make sense? It's hard to explain. I'm still figuring it out myself, honestly.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a fairytale romance, you know? It started out as just\u2026hanging out. He was a sweet guy, a little clueless, but genuinely nice. And good at guitar. That was a plus.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, it was mostly awkward. He was\u2026supportive, in his own Bleeker way. Like, he brought me orange juice and tried to be helpful, but he mostly just looked terrified. He wasn't exactly prepared to be a dad. Neither was I, honestly.\n\nIt was hard to talk to him about it, because he got all flustered and couldn't really handle serious conversations. He'd try to make jokes, which weren't always appropriate. It wasn't that he didn't *care*, he just didn't know *how* to care in a way that felt\u2026useful.\n\nAs the pregnancy went on, things got a little better. He started to actually listen, and he started to understand that this wasn't just about me. It was about a whole other person. He started practicing his guitar more, saying he wanted to write a song for the baby. It was kinda sweet, actually.\n\nBut it was never really a *relationship* relationship. It was more like\u2026a friendship that happened to involve a pregnancy. We were both too young, too messed up, to be good partners. We were just trying to figure things out.\n\nBy the time I decided to give the baby up for adoption, he was\u2026okay with it. He wasn't thrilled, but he understood. He knew I was doing what was best for the baby. And he knew that we weren't ready to be parents.\n\nIn the end, we just kind of drifted apart. We still talked sometimes, but it wasn't the same. It was like we'd shared this really intense experience, and then it was over.\n\nIt wasn't a bad relationship, it just wasn't\u2026right. He was a good guy, Bleeker. Just not *my* guy. And that's okay. Sometimes, people just aren't meant to be together, even if they make a baby. It's weird, but it's true.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask me about that? It's not like I meticulously planned it out, okay? It's not some deep, symbolic thing.\n\nMy dad\u2026he\u2019s a bit of a classic movie buff. And he and my stepmom were going through this whole Greek mythology phase when I was born. They were watching a lot of movies with goddesses and stuff. And apparently, Juno was the goddess of marriage and childbirth. Which, you know, is ironic, considering\u2026everything.\n\nHe just thought it sounded pretty. And my stepmom liked it too. So, Juno it was. I didn't really have a say. I was, like, a day old.\n\nHonestly, I always thought it was kinda dorky. It doesn't exactly scream \"cool teenager,\" you know? It's a really\u2026old lady name. But I got used to it. And it's me.\n\nSo, yeah. That's the story. It's not some grand statement about my destiny or anything. It's just a name my dad picked because he thought it sounded nice. Don't overthink it. It's just a name.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark weren't exactly overflowing with joy when I told them. They were\u2026polite. And trying to be supportive. But it wasn't exactly a party.\n\nSo when she said she was *relieved* to see the ultrasound photo? That it wasn't, like, a monster or something? It just\u2026hit different. It was like, she wasn't excited about *me* having a baby. She was just relieved it looked normal.\n\nIt made me feel like\u2026a vessel. Like I was just a way for them to have a baby, and not a person with feelings and stuff. Which, I guess, is kinda true, but still. It's not a great feeling.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I just kinda shrugged and said something sarcastic. But inside, I was just\u2026deflated. It made me realize how much they wanted this baby, and how little they actually cared about *me*.\n\nIt also made me think about how weird the whole situation was. Like, here I am, a teenager, giving a married couple a baby. It's not exactly a Hallmark movie.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me even more determined to find the right family for this kid. A family that would love him or her unconditionally, and not just be relieved that the ultrasound looked okay.\n\nIt was a messy feeling. A mix of sadness, anger, and just\u2026confusion. But it also made me stronger, I guess. It made me realize I needed to do this for myself, and for the baby, and not for anyone else.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa's mom. Brenda. Yeah, that was\u2026a moment. A *very* long moment. It was like being cornered by a very angry, very well-meaning, but ultimately terrifying grizzly bear.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to look small and non-threatening. And talk really fast. It's a defense mechanism. I figured if I just rattled off enough information, she'd eventually run out of steam.\n\nI think the first thing I said was, like, \"Hi! I'm Juno! I'm\u2026here about the baby!\" Which, in retrospect, was probably not the smoothest opening line. But it was honest.\n\nThen I launched into a whole explanation about Paul, and Vanessa, and the adoption plan, and how we were just trying to be responsible. I think I used the word \"responsible\" like, five times. It felt important.\n\nShe was mostly just\u2026disappointed. And worried. And really, really loud. She kept asking me if I was \"okay,\" which was weird. Like, what did she think was going to happen to me? I wasn't the one carrying a baby!\n\nI think what finally calmed her down \u2013 a little bit \u2013 was when I admitted I was scared too. I told her I didn't know what I was doing, and that I was just trying to make the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nAnd then Vanessa chimed in and was all, \"Mom, she's a good person!\" Which helped. A lot.\n\nIt was still awkward for a while. She kept offering me cookies, which I politely declined. I was too stressed to eat.\n\nBut eventually, she came around. She realized I wasn't some delinquent trying to take advantage of Vanessa. I was just\u2026a girl who made a mistake and was trying to do the right thing.\n\nIt was a rough afternoon, though. Definitely one for the books. And I learned a valuable lesson: never underestimate the power of a mother's rage. Seriously. It's a force of nature.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026still a tough question. Even now. It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, totally giving the baby away!\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? I was scared. Really scared. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a whole human being. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. I could barely keep my grades up, how was I supposed to be a mom?\n\nAnd it wasn't just me. My parents\u2026they were supportive, but they weren't exactly equipped to help. They're\u2026well, they're my parents. They love me, but they're not exactly known for their practicality.\n\nBut the biggest thing was\u2026I wanted the baby to have a good life. A *really* good life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to it. Not right then. Not with my life the way it was.\n\nMark, the dad\u2026he wasn't exactly stepping up. He was a nice guy, but he was\u2026lost. He had his own stuff going on. He wasn't ready to be a father.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And I met Vanessa and Mark, the couple who ended up adopting the baby. And they were\u2026amazing. They were stable, loving, and they had a beautiful home. They were everything I wanted for the baby.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still is. But I knew it was the right one. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt doesn't mean I didn't love it. I did. I do. But love isn't always enough. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? But I try to focus on the fact that the baby is happy and loved. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the lab partner thing? It's a sensitive topic, alright?\n\nLook, it's not that I *wanted* to be a deadbeat. It's just...biology wasn't exactly my forte. Like, at all. All those diagrams of reproductive systems? Traumatic. And Paul? He was so\u2026enthusiastic. Like, *way* too enthusiastic about fetal pigs. It was unsettling.\n\nI tried, okay? I really did. But I got distracted. Easily. There was a really good mix on my iPod, and I was trying to perfect my eyeliner, and then I started thinking about, you know, everything else that was going on in my life. Which was a lot.\n\nAnd honestly, Paul was a bit of a know-it-all. He kept correcting my observations and explaining things like I was five. It was annoying.\n\nSo, yeah, I didn't exactly pull my weight. I mostly just stood there and looked vaguely interested. I offered moral support. That counts for something, right?\n\nIt's not like I'm a bad person. I just have\u2026priorities. And fetal pigs weren't high on the list.\n\nDon't judge me. It was a stressful time. And honestly, I think I handled it with a surprising amount of grace, considering.", "Ugh. Seriously? They're bickering *during* lab? Like, are they trying to get expelled? This is why I prefer to work alone. People are the worst.\n\nOkay, okay, deep breaths. If I *had* to get involved \u2013 which, honestly, I'd try to avoid \u2013 I'd probably just roll my eyes and say something like, \"Guys, seriously? We're dissecting a frog, not negotiating a peace treaty. Can we maybe focus on the actual science for, like, five minutes?\"\n\nThen I'd probably give them both a look that says, \"I'm judging you so hard right now.\"\n\nIf they didn't shut up, I'd probably just grab my lab notebook and move to another table. I'm not a mediator. I'm a survivor. And sometimes, survival means avoiding drama.\n\nHonestly, it's probably something stupid. He probably thinks she's not taking it seriously, and she probably thinks he's being a know-it-all. It's always the same.\n\nI'd just want to get the lab done and get out of there. I have more important things to worry about, like, you know, a baby. And whether or not Paul is going to show up with pizza. That's a much more pressing concern than their little squabble.\n\nSeriously, though. Get it together, people. It's a frog.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolls eyes) Okay, look. It's not a \"hasty\" abortion. It's\u2026a considered one. And it's not like I *want* to, okay? It's just\u2026complicated.\n\nIt's not about not wanting the baby. It's about\u2026everything else. I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being.\n\nPaul, he's\u2026Paul. Sweet, but not exactly ready to be a dad. And my parents? They're great, but this is\u2026a lot. It's going to change everything.\n\nAnd honestly? I have plans. I want to go to college. I want to see the world. I want to\u2026be me, you know? And I don't think I can do all that with a baby right now.\n\nMark, the dad, he's\u2026well, he's not exactly stepping up. He's a senior, focused on his music. He's a nice guy, but he's not equipped to be a father.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm considering adoption. It's not the easy way out. It's actually really hard. But it feels like the right thing to do. For me, for the baby, for everyone involved.\n\nIt's not something I'm taking lightly. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's just\u2026it's a really big decision. And it's kind of terrifying.\n\nSo, don't judge me, okay? It's my life, and I'm trying to do what I think is best. It's not about being irresponsible. It's about being realistic. And maybe a little bit selfish. But isn't everyone a little bit selfish sometimes?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *Boone's*? It's a valid question, I guess. People need to know.\n\nLook, I'm not a huge drinker, okay? But when you're, like, sixteen and trying to look cool, and Paul's older brother is offering you stuff, you gotta pick something. And the Snow Peak Peach? It's just\u2026different.\n\nIt's not trying too hard, you know? Like, the other flavors are all super sweet and fake-tasting. But the Peach? It's subtle. It's got a little bit of tang. It's like a grown-up juice box.\n\nAnd the color is really pretty. It's this pale pink, almost like a sunset. It just feels\u2026right.\n\nPlus, it doesn't taste like regret the next morning. Well, not *as* much regret.\n\nHonestly, it's probably just nostalgia. It reminds me of that whole messy time with Paul and the baby. But it's a good memory, even if it was complicated.\n\nSo yeah, Snow Peak Peach. It's the best. Don't judge me. It's a sophisticated choice. For a sixteen-year-old trying to navigate life, anyway.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know why everyone's all weirded out about the whole baby thing? It's\u2026complicated. And honestly, kinda annoying.\n\nIt's not like I *planned* this, okay? It was a one-time thing with Paulie Bleeker, and now here I am, pregnant. And people just don't know how to react.\n\nMy parents, they're trying to be supportive, but you can tell they're freaked out. My dad keeps making awkward jokes, and my mom just cries a lot. They wanted me to go to Princeton, not\u2026have a baby.\n\nAnd then there's the whole school thing. Everyone's whispering and staring. It's like I'm some kind of zoo exhibit. And Mr. Mundy, my guidance counselor? He's just\u2026confused. He keeps trying to get me to talk about my \"future plans,\" like having a baby isn't a future plan.\n\nI think people are unsure because it doesn't fit their idea of how things are supposed to go. They expect teenagers to be worried about prom and college applications, not\u2026gestation. It's not the \"normal\" path, and people get uncomfortable when things aren't normal.\n\nAnd honestly, *I'm* still figuring things out. I'm not keeping the baby. I've decided to give it up for adoption. But that's a really big decision, and it's not something people understand right away. They think I should be sadder, or more scared, or\u2026something.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. And everyone has an opinion. It's exhausting. I just want people to be cool about it, you know? But I guess that's too much to ask.\n\n\n\nIt's my body, my decision. And I'm doing what I think is best. But trying to explain that to everyone else is\u2026a whole other level of complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026not a fun conversation. Bren is a good guy, a really good guy, and he was right to be worried. But it's not like he *understood*. It's not like anyone understood, except maybe Paul.\n\nI think I mostly just got defensive. I mean, what was I supposed to say? \"Oh yeah, I'm totally falling for a married man, it's a great idea, let's all just be cool with it?\" No.\n\nI remember saying something like, \"It's complicated, okay? It's not like I'm trying to break up his marriage.\" Which, looking back, was a really lame thing to say. Like, that makes it okay?\n\nI tried to explain that it wasn't about wanting to *have* him, it was about\u2026I don't even know what it was about. Feeling seen, I guess. Feeling like someone actually *got* me. And Mark, for whatever reason, did. He listened. He didn't judge.\n\nBut Bren was right to call me out on it. He said something about how it was unfair to Mark's wife, and how it was probably going to end badly. And I knew he was right. I just didn't want to admit it.\n\nI think I mostly just deflected. I changed the subject. I made a sarcastic comment. I did what I always do when I'm feeling vulnerable. I built a wall.\n\nIt was a really awkward car ride. And honestly, it made me think. It made me realize that Bren was a better friend than I deserved. And that maybe, just maybe, I was making a really bad decision.\n\nIt didn't change things immediately, obviously. But it planted a seed. And eventually, that seed grew into something that made me realize I needed to get out of that situation.\n\nSo, yeah. I didn't handle it well. I was a mess. But Bren was a good friend for calling me out on it. He deserved better than that, and so did Mark's wife.", "Ugh, seriously? We're still talking about the slushie? Okay, fine. Look, it was a really bad day, okay? A *really* bad day. Paul was being all weird and distant, and I was just\u2026overwhelmed.\n\nAnd Mr. Pearl, he was just\u2026sitting there. With his mom's ashes. And he was being all sad and quiet, and it just\u2026felt wrong. Like, too serious. Like he was trying to be all dignified and stuff, but it was just making everything worse.\n\nI don't know. It just popped into my head. It was a stupid impulse. A really, really stupid impulse. I just wanted to\u2026disrupt things. To make him laugh, or at least crack a smile. To remind him that life is messy and weird and sometimes you just gotta embrace the chaos.\n\nIt was a blue raspberry slushie, by the way. It seemed appropriate.\n\nI know it was disrespectful. I get that. And I apologized. A lot. But honestly, it kind of worked. He did laugh. And we ended up having a really good conversation.\n\nSo yeah, I poured my slushie into the urn. Don't judge me. It was a moment of weakness. And sometimes, moments of weakness lead to unexpected connections.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Just\u2026complicated.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough *without* a baby growing inside you. It felt like everything was happening at once. Like, I was still trying to figure out who I was, and suddenly I was responsible for another human being.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just\u2026messy. There were days I felt totally overwhelmed and terrified. I mean, I was a kid myself! I didn't know anything about babies or parenting or\u2026life, really.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was having people I could lean on. Paul, obviously. He was\u2026a good guy. A little clueless sometimes, but he tried. And my dad. He was surprisingly cool about the whole thing. He didn't judge me, he just\u2026helped.\n\nAnd then there was Leah. She was my rock. She just listened, and she didn't try to fix things. She just let me be me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nI also tried to just\u2026keep things normal. I still went to school, I still hung out with my friends, I still listened to The Moldy Peaches. I didn't want the pregnancy to define me. I wanted to still be Juno, even with a baby on the way.\n\nIt was hard, though. There were a lot of awkward conversations, a lot of stares, a lot of people offering unsolicited advice. And I had to deal with my own feelings about giving the baby up. That was\u2026really hard.\n\nI think I just took it one day at a time. I focused on what I could control, and I tried not to worry about the things I couldn't. And I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but I got through it. And I think, in the end, it made me a better person. A more mature person. A person who was ready to face whatever life threw at me.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. But I wouldn't trade it. Not really. It made me who I am. And that's something.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026a lot. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense. Like, really eager. It was kinda awkward, honestly.\n\nHe was trying *so* hard to be cool, you know? Like, he was wearing Vans and listening to Death Cab for Cutie and trying to talk about music with me. Which was sweet, I guess, but also kinda transparent. He was clearly trying to impress me, and Paul, and it was just\u2026a lot.\n\nHe kept asking me about my interests, and then immediately trying to relate to them. Like, I mentioned I liked comic books, and he was all, \"Oh, I love comic books! Have you read Watchmen?\" And I was like, \"Yeah, actually, I have.\" And he just kinda froze. It was weird.\n\nAnd he was *really* into the whole \"domestic bliss\" thing. Like, he was already picturing us having picnics and going to baseball games and decorating a nursery. Which, okay, that's nice, but it was also kinda overwhelming. I hadn't even decided if I was actually going through with the adoption yet!\n\nPaul was way more chill. He just let me be me and didn't try to force anything. Mark was\u2026enthusiastic. To say the least.\n\nI think he was just really excited about becoming a dad. And I get that. But it was a little much for me. I needed someone who was gonna be there for the baby, yeah, but also someone who was gonna let me be a teenager. And Mark was kinda stuck in \"Dad Mode\" from the get-go.\n\nIt wasn't a bad experience, exactly. He was a nice guy. Just\u2026a little too eager for my liking. It made me realize I needed someone who was gonna be a partner, not just a dad. Someone who was gonna get me, you know? And Paul, thankfully, did.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Bleeker. That kid. Honestly. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like he was being *mean*, exactly. He's just\u2026Bleeker. Clumsy with words, always saying the wrong thing, but with good intentions, I guess. But still.\n\nWhen he said something about me looking like I was \"expanding horizons,\" or whatever ridiculous phrase he came up with\u2026it just\u2026stung. It wasn't the words themselves, it was the *timing*. It was right after I'd been trying to avoid looking at myself in the mirror, trying to pretend it wasn't happening.\n\nIt felt like everyone was suddenly noticing. Like my body wasn't my own anymore. Like it was just this\u2026thing\u2026that was growing.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a sarcastic comment back, something about needing a bigger wardrobe. But inside, I was just\u2026weirdly vulnerable.\n\nIt wasn't about him, really. It was about everything. About being pregnant, about giving the baby up, about feeling like my life was completely changing. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nAnd Bleeker, bless his heart, just didn't *get* it. He was trying to be supportive, but he didn't understand the messiness of it all. He just saw a growing belly.\n\nSo yeah. It wasn't a great moment. It just reminded me that this wasn't going to be easy. And that sometimes, even the people who care about you can say the wrong thing at the wrong time.\n\nUgh. I need a smoothie.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like there was *one* thing. It was a whole mess of things, all tangled up together. But if I had to pick the hardest part\u2026it wasn't the physical stuff, you know? It wasn't even the people giving me their opinions.\n\nIt was the feeling of\u2026disconnect. Like, knowing this little person was growing inside me, and knowing I wasn't going to be the one raising it. It was like loving someone you already knew you had to say goodbye to.\n\nIt sounds super cheesy, I know. But it's true. It wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting a good life for the baby, and knowing I couldn't give it to them. Not right now, anyway.\n\nAnd it was hard to explain that to people. They kept asking me if I was sad, and yeah, I was. But it wasn't just sadness. It was\u2026complicated. It was grief for a future I wasn't going to have, and hope for a future the baby *would* have.\n\nAnd then there was the guilt. Feeling guilty for not being able to be a mom, feeling guilty for choosing adoption, feeling guilty for\u2026everything. It was exhausting.\n\nBut the hardest part, I think, was just accepting that I wasn't in control. That I had to trust that Mark and Vanessa would love the baby and give it everything I couldn't. That was the scariest part. Letting go.\n\nIt still kinda stings, if I'm being honest. But I know I made the right decision. And that's what matters. It just\u2026doesn't make it easy.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. It was freezing, first of all. And he had this\u2026 intense energy. Like, way too much energy for a Tuesday morning.\n\nHe was holding a sign with a picture of a baby and yelling about how babies are \"miracles\" and \"gifts from God\" and how abortion is \"murder.\" It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nBut the thing that really stuck with me, the thing he kept repeating, was that every baby has a soul and deserves a chance to live, even if it's a hard life. He said, and I quote, \"Every little heartbeat is a life, a precious, innocent life that deserves to be cherished.\"\n\nIt was just\u2026simplistic. Like, yeah, of course babies are precious. But it's not that easy. It's not just about the heartbeat. It's about everything else. It's about being ready, about being able to provide, about wanting a kid in the first place. It's about a whole lot of stuff he clearly hadn't thought about.\n\nIt was just\u2026 frustrating. He made it sound like it was all so black and white, when it's anything but. And honestly, it felt really judgmental. Like he knew better than me what was right for my life.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me roll my eyes. It was a whole thing.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive this. It was\u2026a lot. Right. So, at the clinic, I ran into Paulie Bleeker. *Paulie*. Of all people.\n\nHe was there with his mom, getting checked out for\u2026something. I didn\u2019t ask. It\u2019s none of my business. And honestly, I was trying to be invisible. Like, a ninja. But Paulie, being Paulie, spotted me immediately.\n\nHe just\u2026stared. Like a deer in headlights. And then he said, and I quote, \u201cJuno? What are *you* doing here?\u201d\n\nLike he thought I was getting a manicure or something. Honestly.\n\nI just mumbled something about a check-up and tried to walk past him, but he blocked my way. He was all awkward and red-faced and kept fiddling with his hands.\n\nThen he said, and this is the part that really stung, \u201cAre you\u2026sick?\u201d\n\nSick! Like I was catching the flu or something. Not\u2026you know.\n\nI just glared at him and said, \u201cNo, Paulie. I\u2019m not sick. I just\u2026have an appointment.\u201d\n\nHe looked confused and then kinda sad. And then he just stepped aside and let me pass. He didn\u2019t say anything else.\n\nIt was awful. Just\u2026awful. It was the first time I really realized how much he didn\u2019t know. And how much I wasn\u2019t telling him. It was a really weird moment. And it made me feel even more alone.\n\nUgh. I need a smoothie. And maybe to pretend that whole thing never happened.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Su-Chin. She's\u2026intense. And she has opinions. About everything.\n\nSo, yeah, I mentioned the Adderall thing. It just kinda slipped out, you know? I was trying to explain why Paul was being all\u2026hyper-focused and weirdly productive, and it just came out. Big mistake. Huge.\n\nHer face. Oh. My. God. It was like someone had just told her the earth was flat. Her eyebrows went *way* up, and she got this really pinched look around her mouth. Like she was smelling something bad.\n\nShe didn't yell, which was good, because that would have been mortifying. But she launched into this whole lecture about how Adderall is a \"crutch\" and how people need to \"deal with their issues\" instead of masking them with drugs. It was a lot.\n\nAnd then she started talking about how it's \"irresponsible\" to be pregnant while taking medication, even if it's just Paul taking it. Like, I already know it's not ideal, okay? I'm not an idiot. But it's not like *I'm* taking it!\n\nShe kept saying things like, \"You need to be a role model!\" and \"Think about the baby!\" which, yeah, I *am* thinking about the baby! That's kinda the whole point!\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot of judgment. A lot of unsolicited advice. And a lot of side-eye.\n\nHonestly, it made me feel really defensive. And kinda small. Like I was doing something wrong just by being honest about what was going on.\n\nShe eventually calmed down, but the awkwardness lingered for, like, the rest of the day. She kept giving me these little looks, like she was worried I was going to turn into some kind of drug addict.\n\nUgh. Su-Chin. She means well, I guess. But sometimes she just\u2026doesn't get it.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *make* me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't one thing, you know? It was the whole vibe. The waiting room was all pastel colors and fake plants, like someone was trying way too hard to make it seem\u2026calming. But it just felt creepy. Like a dentist's office designed by someone who'd never actually been to a dentist.\n\nBut mostly, it was the people. All the couples, holding hands and looking all\u2026hopeful. And the way they were looking at me. Like I was some kind of\u2026alien. Like they could *see* what was going on.\n\nAnd then there was that one lady, knitting. Just\u2026knitting. Like she had all the time in the world. It was so aggressively normal, it was terrifying. It felt like she knew something I didn't.\n\nBut the worst part? It was the silence. Everyone was trying to be quiet, respectful, but it just made everything feel heavier. Like the air was thick with\u2026expectations. And fear.\n\nI just kept thinking about what everyone else was there for. And what *I* was there for. And how my life was about to change, whether I wanted it to or not.\n\nIt wasn't a jump-scare kind of terrified. It was a slow-burn, creeping-under-your-skin kind of terrified. Like something bad was about to happen, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really bad waiting room. Seriously. I think I need a tater tot.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026a while. Look, it's complicated.\n\nDo I still\u2026*think* about him? Yeah, sometimes. He was a good guy. Sweet. A little clueless, maybe, but genuinely good. And he played the guitar, which is always a plus.\n\nBut \"feelings\"? That's a strong word. It wasn't like some epic, sweeping romance, you know? It was\u2026comfortable. Safe. He was a friend, and for a little while, maybe something more.\n\nBut I was, like, a mess at the time. Dealing with a lot. And he was\u2026Bleeker. He was happy just being Bleeker. And that's okay. It's good, even. But I needed someone who could handle all my\u2026stuff. And Paul, well, he could.\n\nSo, no, I don't think I have *romantic* feelings for Bleeker anymore. It's more like\u2026fondness. A little bit of nostalgia. I hope he's doing okay. I hope he's still playing music.\n\nIt's just\u2026we were at different places in our lives. And sometimes, that's just how it goes. It doesn't mean it wasn't real, or that it wasn't important. It just means it wasn't meant to be.\n\nCan we talk about something else now? This is getting weirdly emotional. I need a slice of pizza.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Vanessa's decorating choices. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not that it's *bad*, exactly. It's just...not what I would have pictured. At all.\n\nShe went full-on woodland creatures. Like, every surface is covered in owls and foxes and little deer. It looks like a Disney movie threw up in there. And everything is pastel. Pastel everything. It's aggressively cute.\n\nI mean, I appreciate the effort, I guess. She's trying to make it a welcoming space for the baby. But it's a little overwhelming. It feels like the baby's gonna be born with a sugar rush just from being in the room.\n\nPaul keeps saying it's \"adorable\" and \"whimsical,\" but I think he's just trying to be nice. He's a good guy, but he has zero taste.\n\nI suggested maybe toning it down a little, adding some more neutral colors, but Vanessa just gave me this look. Like, I'm ruining her vision. It's her first baby, she's allowed to go a little crazy, I guess.\n\nHonestly, I'm just hoping the baby doesn't develop a crippling fear of woodland creatures. Or pastel colors. It's gonna be a weird childhood, that's for sure.\n\nI'm just trying to stay out of it. It's her room, her baby. I'll just bring the practical stuff, like diapers and wipes. And maybe a black and white mobile. For balance.", "Ugh. Okay, so people keep asking me about \"nesting.\" It's\u2026intense. Like, suddenly everyone expects you to be all gushy about tiny socks and coordinated wall colors. And honestly? It kinda freaks me out.\n\nIt's not that I don't want the baby. It's just\u2026it feels so *permanent*. Like, once you start building a nursery, it's real, real real. And I'm still trying to wrap my head around that.\n\nPaul and Vanessa are super into it. Vanessa's already got a whole Pinterest board dedicated to organic cotton everything. It's cute, I guess. But it also feels\u2026overwhelming. Like, there's so much stuff you *need* to buy. And so much pressure to create this perfect little world for a tiny human.\n\nI'm more of a \"let's just get the basics\" kind of person. A safe place to sleep, some clothes, and a lot of diapers. That's all it really needs, right? I don't need a themed room with a mobile and a rocking chair and a miniature version of everything.\n\nI guess I'm just not a naturally \"nesting\" person. I'm more of a \"winging it\" kind of person. Which, I know, is probably not the best quality in a soon-to-be mom. But hey, I'm trying.\n\nI'm helping a little bit. I picked out a few books. And I'm trying to be supportive of Vanessa's enthusiasm. But mostly, I'm just trying not to get too stressed out about it all.\n\nIt's a weird feeling. Like, you're preparing for something huge, but you're also kinda scared of losing your old life. It's a lot to process.\n\nSo, yeah. Nesting. It's\u2026a thing. And I'm trying to deal with it. But honestly? I'd rather be listening to The Moldy Peaches.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on those women at the mall. Seriously. It was\u2026a whole thing. Like, a different planet.\n\nIt wasn't even the shopping, it was the *way* they shopped. All perfectly coordinated outfits, like they were going to a gala, not just to buy a sweater. And the attitude! Like, they were doing *me* a favor by gracing the store with their presence.\n\nAnd the kids! Oh my god, the kids. All dressed in miniature versions of their moms' outfits, looking completely miserable. Like, \"Please, just let me play with a Lego.\" It was depressing.\n\nIt just felt so\u2026fake. Like, they weren't actually enjoying anything. It was all about appearances and status and having the right brands. It was exhausting just watching them.\n\nI mean, I get wanting to look nice. But it's like, relax. It's just clothes. It's not a personality. And honestly, a little bit of ripped denim and a band t-shirt is way more comfortable.\n\nIt made me appreciate Paul and Vanessa even more, you know? They're just\u2026real. They don't care about labels or impressing anyone. They just care about being happy.\n\nSo yeah, the well-heeled women at the mall? Not my vibe. At all. I'd rather hang out with people who are comfortable in their own skin, even if their skin is covered in thrift store finds. It's just\u2026more authentic. And less stressful.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breaths. It's\u2026a lot to process, still. Honestly? Terrifying. And also\u2026kind of amazing? It's a weird mix.\n\nWhen I first found out, it was just\u2026panic. Like, my life was already kinda messy, and then BAM, suddenly I'm responsible for another human being. It's not exactly something they teach you in health class.\n\nThe changes are\u2026everything. My body, obviously. But also my priorities. I used to be all about music and movies and just, like, figuring out who *I* was. Now, it's about making sure this little person has everything they need. It's a huge shift.\n\nAnd the responsibilities? Don't even get me started. It's not just about feeding and changing diapers (which, let me tell you, is a whole thing). It's about shaping a person. Teaching them right from wrong. Helping them become a decent human being. That's\u2026a lot of pressure.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I'm scared I'm gonna mess it up. I'm not exactly a role model. I say what's on my mind, I'm sarcastic, I'm not always the most responsible person. But I'm trying. I'm really trying.\n\nI'm lucky to have Paul and Vanessa. They're gonna be amazing parents. And they're helping me figure things out. But ultimately, it's my decision, and I'm gonna do everything I can to give this baby a good life.\n\nIt's not what I expected my life to be like. But sometimes, life throws you curveballs. And sometimes, those curveballs turn out to be\u2026okay. Maybe even good.\n\nIt's still scary. But it's also\u2026exciting. And I guess that's enough for now. I'm just gonna take it one day at a time. And try not to overthink things too much. Which, let's be real, is gonna be a challenge.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m just picking someone out of a catalog, okay? It\u2019s not about finding the \u201cperfect\u201d parents. It\u2019s about finding the *right* parents. For *this* baby.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026I want someone who gets it. Someone who isn\u2019t gonna try to mold the kid into something they\u2019re not. Someone who\u2019s okay with a little weirdness. Someone who\u2019s\u2026chill.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they\u2019re not, like, super-traditional. They don\u2019t have a bunch of expectations. They\u2019re already a little bit outside the box. Vanessa\u2019s a lawyer, but she\u2019s also into pottery. Mark\u2019s a doctor, but he plays in a band. They\u2019re\u2026real.\n\nI\u2019ve met a lot of couples through the agency, and a lot of them seem\u2026intense. Like, they have this whole plan for the kid\u2019s life already mapped out. Piano lessons, soccer practice, Ivy League schools\u2026 It just feels\u2026suffocating.\n\nI want this kid to have a chance to be themselves. To figure things out. To make their own mistakes. And I think Mark and Vanessa would let them do that.\n\nIt\u2019s not about judging other people. It\u2019s just about what I think is best for the baby. And honestly, it\u2019s also about what I need. I need to know that the kid is going to be loved and accepted for who they are, even if they\u2019re a little bit\u2026different.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, okay? It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. But I want to make the best decision possible. And right now, that means choosing Mark and Vanessa. They just\u2026feel right.", "Ugh. Okay, so, hypothetically speaking, if I decided to\u2026keep the baby. Which, like, is a *huge* if. But if I did\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be all sunshine and daisies, that\u2019s for sure. There\u2019s a whole mountain of stuff I\u2019d have to deal with.\n\nFirst off, school. I\u2019m a junior. I\u2019m supposed to be thinking about colleges and stuff, not diapers and\u2026well, everything. I\u2019d probably have to drop out, or at least take a really long break. Which means my plans for\u2026whatever I was gonna do with my life\u2026would be totally derailed.\n\nThen there\u2019s the money thing. My dad works construction, and my stepmom\u2019s a nurse. They\u2019re good people, but they\u2019re not exactly rolling in dough. I don\u2019t want to be a burden, and I definitely don\u2019t want my kid to grow up worrying about money all the time.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s\u2026me. I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m still figuring out who *I* am. I\u2019m not exactly known for being responsible. I like music and movies and hanging out with my friends. I\u2019m not exactly equipped to be a mom. I mean, I can barely keep my room clean.\n\nPaul, he\u2019s\u2026sweet. But he\u2019s also sixteen. We\u2019re both kids. We\u2019re not ready for this. We\u2019d be struggling, and the baby would be struggling too.\n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019m scared. Scared of messing it up. Scared of not being a good mom. Scared of losing my own life.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want a kid, exactly. It\u2019s just\u2026now is not the time. I need to finish school, figure out what I want to do with my life, and be a little more\u2026grown up.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to think about. A *lot*. And it\u2019s not a decision I\u2019d take lightly. It\u2019s just\u2026complicated. Really, really complicated.\n\n\n\nIt's not like I haven't thought about it, okay? It's just...a lot.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to revisit *that* conversation? Fine. It wasn't exactly a fun memory.\n\nLeah, being Leah, immediately jumped to the whole \"keep it and we'll raise it together\" thing. Like it was just *that* simple. She was all, \"We can figure it out! We're young, we can make it work!\" and started talking about how we could move in with her parents and get jobs.\n\nIt was...a lot. And honestly, it was kind of overwhelming. She was picturing this perfect little family, and I was just trying to figure out how to get through the next five minutes without completely falling apart.\n\nShe kept saying it was \"our baby\" and that we had a responsibility to it. Which, yeah, I knew that. But I also knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not then, and probably not for a long time.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't care about the baby, it was just...I wasn't equipped to give it the life it deserved. And Leah, bless her heart, just didn't seem to get that. She was all about feelings and instincts, and I was trying to be practical.\n\nIt led to a pretty big fight, actually. But eventually, she came around and understood that adoption was the best option for everyone involved. Even if she didn't like it.", "Ugh. Okay, look. That was\u2026not my finest moment. And I get why people would be, like, rightfully annoyed by that. It was stupid. And mean. And honestly, I was just trying to deflect.\n\nIt was a really weird day, okay? I had just found out\u2026things. Big things. And I was freaking out internally. And those women were just\u2026so *enthusiastic*. About everything. And it was just\u2026a lot.\n\nI know it wasn't cool to make fun of them. It was a really immature way to deal with my own stuff. I was projecting, basically. Taking my anxiety out on people who were just trying to have a good time.\n\nI'm not proud of it. I really wasn't. And I definitely wouldn't do it again. I mean, I *try* not to be a jerk, but sometimes I just\u2026say things. Without thinking. It's a problem.\n\nPaul called me out on it, obviously. He's good at that. And he was right. It was insensitive and unnecessary.\n\nSo yeah. I apologize. To those women. And to anyone else who was offended. I was being a total idiot. It was a bad day, and I handled it badly. I'm working on it, okay? I'm trying to be a better person. It's a process.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little mortifying.\n\nLook, Vanessa was being\u2026Vanessa. All enthusiastic and helpful and just generally overwhelming. And I was, like, completely overwhelmed *already*. I mean, I was pregnant, okay? My body was doing things I didn't even know it could do. And Paul was being\u2026Paul. Supportive, but also kinda clueless.\n\nShe just\u2026reached out. And I froze. I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to be rude. And honestly, I was kinda numb. It wasn't like I was *excited* about someone touching my belly. It just\u2026happened.\n\nIt was a weird moment. A really weird moment. And I definitely regretted it afterwards. It felt\u2026invasive. But I didn't say anything. I just kind of stood there like a deer in headlights.\n\nI guess I just wanted to be polite. And maybe I was a little bit scared to assert myself. I was still figuring things out, you know? Still trying to figure out who I was and what I wanted.\n\nIt wasn't a good moment. And I definitely wouldn't let anyone do that again. But it happened. And it's over. Can we please talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of tater tots? Or maybe the existential dread of being a teenager? Anything but my belly. Please.", "Ugh, seriously? It's like, people see this bump and suddenly I'm invisible, except for the fact that everyone's staring at my stomach. It's weird. It's like I'm a walking, talking bowling ball or something.\n\nIt's mostly older people, honestly. They'll just...veer out of the way. Like I'm gonna accidentally roll over their feet or something. And then they give you this look, like, \"Oh, you poor thing, you're so *big*.\" It's not helpful.\n\nAnd then there are the people who try to be helpful and offer you a seat on the bus. Which is nice, I guess, but I'm not *incapacitated*. I'm just pregnant. I can still walk.\n\nI think they just assume I'm super uncomfortable and about to collapse. Which, okay, sometimes I am. But most of the time, I'm just trying to get from point A to point B without being treated like a fragile porcelain doll.\n\nIt's like, I'm still me. I'm still Juno. I just happen to be carrying a tiny human inside me. It doesn't change the fact that I can navigate a crowded hallway without needing a personal escort.\n\nIt's a little dehumanizing, honestly. Like I'm just a vessel. But whatever. I just try to ignore it and keep walking. And maybe give them a sarcastic side-eye. That usually works.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated.

It\u2019s\u2026intense.\n\nAnd that\u2019s kinda the problem. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad people, it\u2019s that they\u2019re\u2026too perfect. It feels like they\u2019re picking a baby out of a catalog. Like, \u201cOh, yes, a baby will complete our perfect life.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not saying they wouldn\u2019t be good parents. They probably would be. But it feels\u2026sterile. Like the baby is a project, not a person.\n\nPaul and Vanessa, they want a baby to *fix* something. To fill a hole. And I get that, I really do. But I want this baby to be wanted for who it *is*, not for what it represents.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they\u2019re\u2026safe. And safe is good, right? But it\u2019s also kinda boring. I want this baby to have a little bit of messiness in its life. A little bit of weirdness. A little bit of\u2026me.\n\nI know it sounds selfish. And maybe it is. But I just\u2026I don\u2019t want this baby to be raised in a bubble. I want it to be loved unconditionally, flaws and all. And I\u2019m not sure Mark and Vanessa are equipped to do that. They seem like they need everything to be just so.\n\nIt\u2019s not about them being bad people. It\u2019s about them being\u2026too good. And sometimes, too good isn\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s just\u2026weirdly unsettling.\n\nIt's like, I want this baby to have a life, not a picture-perfect Instagram feed. Does that make sense? It's just...a feeling. A really strong feeling.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa Loring. Honestly? They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *situation*.\n\nLook, Vanessa seems nice enough, I guess. A little\u2026perfect. Like, aggressively perfect. And Mark? He's trying. You can tell he's trying to be a good dad. But he's also kinda clueless. And really into model trains. Which, okay, whatever floats your boat, but it's a little\u2026intense.\n\nThey're just\u2026so *together*. You know? Like, sickeningly sweet and always agreeing with each other. It's kinda weirds me out. It's like they're living in a movie. And I'm just\u2026not a movie person. I prefer reality, even when it's messy.\n\nI feel bad for them, though. They really want a baby. And it's kinda sad that they can't have one on their own. But I also think they have this\u2026idealized vision of what a family should be. And I'm not sure I fit into that vision.\n\nI mean, I'm a teenager who got pregnant. I'm not exactly the picture of domestic bliss.\n\nSo, yeah. They're okay. I guess. I just\u2026don't really get them. And I'm kinda nervous about them getting too attached. It's complicated. Everything is complicated.\n\n\n\nDon't tell them I said that. Seriously. They'd probably knit me a sweater and try to make me drink herbal tea. And I'd rather eat dirt.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Still bringing that up? It's been, like, years. But fine, I'll explain. It's complicated.\n\nMrs. Bleeker\u2026 she's\u2026particular. And she has a very specific vision for her son, Paulie. She wants him to go to Princeton, become a doctor, marry a nice, preppy girl who went to the same private school as him. Basically, the whole nine yards of perfect suburban life.\n\nAnd I\u2026 well, I'm not that. I'm a bit of a mess, okay? I skip school sometimes, I listen to punk rock, I say what's on my mind, and I definitely don't fit into her idea of a \"suitable\" girlfriend.\n\nShe thinks I'm a bad influence on Paulie. She thinks I'm going to distract him from his studies and ruin his future. She's convinced I'm just a phase. She's also not thrilled about the whole\u2026 pregnant thing. That definitely didn't help.\n\nShe's always making little digs at me, passive-aggressive comments about my clothes or my music. She tries to be polite, but you can tell she thinks I'm beneath Paulie. It's super awkward.\n\nHonestly, I think she's just scared. She wants the best for her son, and she doesn't think I'm good enough for him. But Paulie loves me, and that's what matters. And eventually, she came around\u2026 a little. It took a while, and a lot of awkward family dinners, but she eventually realized I wasn't going to ruin her son's life.\n\nBut still. She's always watching me. It's creepy.\n\n\n\nDon't even get me started on her Christmas decorations. They're aggressively cheerful. It's unsettling.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive this. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture moment, you know? It was more\u2026awkward. And a little bit sad.\n\nSee, I was avoiding him. Like, actively avoiding him. After\u2026everything. The whole pregnancy thing, the adoption, it was just\u2026a lot. And I needed space. And he was just\u2026*there*. Being Mark. Which is sweet, I guess, but also suffocating.\n\nSo, I was sitting in my room, trying to do homework, and it was just\u2026quiet. Too quiet. And I saw the CD case sitting on my desk. He'd left it when he dropped off the\u2026stuff. The baby stuff. It was just sitting there, staring at me.\n\nAnd I was being a total jerk, honestly. I was trying to prove to myself that I didn't care. That I was fine. So I thought, \"Fine. I'll listen to it. It'll be terrible. And then I'll feel justified in ignoring him forever.\"\n\nBut it wasn't terrible. It was\u2026good. Really good. It was all those songs we'd talked about, the ones we'd bonded over. The Moldy Peaches, obviously. And some other stuff I hadn't even heard before.\n\nIt was like\u2026he was trying to say something without actually saying it. Like, \"I get you. I understand what you're going through.\" And it was stupid, but it made me feel\u2026less alone.\n\nSo, I listened to it. And then I listened to it again. And then I started actually *thinking* about him. And realizing that maybe, just maybe, he wasn't the worst person in the world.\n\nIt wasn't the CD itself that made me change my mind. It was what it represented. It was him trying to connect with me, even when I was pushing him away. And that, I guess, was kind of hard to ignore.\n\nUgh. Don't tell him I said that. It'll go straight to his head.", "Ugh. Okay. Almost eight months. It's\u2026a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not exactly glamorous, let me tell you. People keep saying I'm \"glowing,\" and I'm pretty sure that's just sweat.\n\nIt's mostly just uncomfortable. Everything is uncomfortable. Sitting, standing, lying down, even *thinking* is uncomfortable. I feel like a whale. A very, very tired whale.\n\nAnd the cravings! Don't even get me started on the cravings. Pickles and ice cream is so clich\u00e9, but honestly? Sometimes it's the only thing that hits the spot. Paul just stares at me when I eat it. He doesn't get it.\n\nBut it's also\u2026weirdly amazing. Like, there's a tiny human *inside* me. That's insane! And I can feel it moving now, which is both cool and terrifying. It kicks a lot when I'm trying to sleep. Little jerk.\n\nI'm also starting to get, like, nesting instincts. I've been rearranging the furniture and obsessively cleaning. It's a control thing, I think. Like, if I can get everything perfect, then maybe I'll be ready for this.\n\nI'm still scared, obviously. This is a huge responsibility. But I'm also\u2026excited. I think. It's a complicated feeling.\n\nMostly, I just want it to be over. But also, I don't want it to be over. It's a mess. A big, hormonal, uncomfortable mess. But it's *my* mess. And that's\u2026something.\n\nSo yeah. Almost eight months. It's a trip. A really weird, exhausting, and slightly terrifying trip.", "Ugh, seriously? This is, like, my *life*. People staring. It's so annoying. I mean, I get it, I'm not exactly blending in. I wear band tees and combat boots and I say what's on my mind, which apparently is a crime against humanity.\n\nBut it's not like I'm trying to be noticed, you know? I'm just\u2026being me. And apparently, \"being me\" is fascinating to some people.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. Maybe it's the whole pregnant-teenager thing. People are always curious, and sometimes they're just plain judgmental. I can see it in their eyes. They're probably thinking, \"Oh, look at that poor girl.\" Or, \"What was she thinking?\"\n\nAnd then there's the fact that I'm not exactly\u2026conventional. I don't fit into any of their little boxes. I don't try to. And I think that freaks some people out.\n\nPlus, I'm pretty good at giving people the side-eye. Maybe they're staring because they're afraid I'm going to judge *them*. Which, let's be honest, I probably am.\n\nIt's just\u2026exhausting. I wish people would just mind their own business. But they don't. They never do. So I just try to ignore it. Or, you know, give them a really withering look. That usually works.\n\nHonestly, it's probably better to be stared at than to be invisible. At least then you know you're making an impression. Even if it's a bad one.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A *bold* choice.\n\nLook, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea. Katrina's\u2026intense. And Bleek is, well, Bleek. He's a sweet guy, but he's kinda oblivious. They're both definitely on the spectrum of \"unique,\" so I guess there's a certain logic to it. Like attracts like, or something.\n\nBut it's also kinda terrifying. Those two together could create a black hole of awkwardness. It'd be like watching a train wreck in slow motion. And I'm pretty sure Katrina would spend the entire night analyzing the structural integrity of the decorations.\n\nHonestly, I just feel bad for whoever has to chaperone. That's gonna be a long night.\n\nI mean, good for Bleek for putting himself out there, I guess. It takes guts to ask someone out, even if that someone is Katrina De Voort. But I'm just saying, I'm not holding my breath for a fairytale ending. It's probably gonna involve a lot of uncomfortable silences and maybe a debate about the merits of different types of duct tape.\n\nIt's\u2026a situation. A very Bleek and Katrina-esque situation. And honestly, I'm just here for the drama.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. It's\u2026a lot to unpack, honestly. Before all this happened, I thought I had things pretty figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, and perfectly content just kinda floating through life, observing everyone else. Turns out, I was mostly just avoiding stuff.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing has been\u2026a crash course in growing up. And not the fun kind with, like, learning to drive. More like the kind where you realize you're responsible for another human being and suddenly all your carefully constructed walls feel really flimsy.\n\nI learned I'm way more capable than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I can handle a lot more than I ever gave myself credit for. I mean, I'm carrying a baby! That's kinda insane when you actually think about it.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be so fiercely independent, so determined to do everything myself. But I realized I can't do this alone. I need Paul, I need my dad, I need my friends. And that's not a weakness, it's just\u2026being human.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing I've learned is that it's okay to not have all the answers. I don't know what the future holds. I don't know if I'm making the right decision. But I'm doing the best I can, and that has to be enough.\n\nI used to think defining myself meant being different, being quirky, being\u2026me. But now I'm realizing that defining myself means figuring out what I believe in, what I stand for, and what kind of person I want to be. And that's a work in progress.\n\nIt's still scary, don't get me wrong. But it's also\u2026good. It's complicated, messy, and terrifyingly beautiful. And I think, maybe, I'm starting to figure out who I am, even if it's not exactly who I thought I'd be.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I've learned. It's a lot. And I'm still learning. But I think I'm okay with that.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? It's just\u2026 frustrating, you know? Katrina is a genuinely sweet person. Like, a little naive, maybe, but she deserves someone who's gonna be straight with her. And Bleeker? He's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's a good guy, I guess. A little clueless, a little awkward, but he means well. But he's also kinda using her to feel better about himself. He's all, \"Oh, I'm so sad about my band, Katrina's so supportive,\" and it feels\u2026 manipulative.\n\nShe's clearly into him, and he's just letting her think whatever she wants without actually saying anything. It's like he's enjoying the attention without being willing to commit. And that's just not fair to her.\n\nI've been through enough drama myself to recognize a messed-up situation when I see one. And I don't want to see Katrina get hurt. She's a good friend, and she deserves someone who's gonna treat her with respect and honesty.\n\nIt's not my place to tell her what to do, obviously. She has to figure that out for herself. But I can at least point out that something feels off. And maybe, just maybe, she'll see it too.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Boys. They're all messes.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so you're finally old enough to go, and suddenly it's...lame? Yeah, I get it. It's a total bait-and-switch.\n\nWhen you're younger, it's this huge deal. Like, the pinnacle of high school. The movie montage moment. But then you actually get there, and it's just...awkward.\n\nIt's like everyone's trying *so* hard to have a good time, that it ends up being the opposite. Everyone's dressed up in these ridiculous outfits, pretending to be something they're not. And the music is always terrible. Seriously, who picks those songs?\n\nAnd the pressure! The pressure to find a date, the pressure to look perfect, the pressure to have a magical night. It's exhausting. It's like, can't we just chill and be ourselves for once?\n\nPlus, once you're old enough to actually *think* about stuff, you realize it's all kinda manufactured. It's a tradition for the sake of tradition. It doesn't actually mean anything.\n\nIt's like, when you're little, you think Santa Claus is real. And then you find out the truth, and it's kinda disappointing. Prom is the same thing. It's a fantasy that doesn't live up to the hype.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather stay home and watch a movie with my friends. Or just, you know, exist. It's way less stressful.\n\nSo yeah, prom's not cool anymore once you're old enough to go. It's just...a thing you do. And then you move on.", "Ugh, okay. Here we go. It's\u2026not exactly a fun topic, but people always ask. It wasn't like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nFirst of all, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I was a kid, having a kid. It didn't make a lot of sense.\n\nAnd my parents\u2026they were supportive, but they weren't exactly thrilled. They were trying to be cool, but I could tell they were scared. And honestly, I was scared too. I didn't want to mess up my life, or the baby's life.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. It wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. A life I couldn't give it at that point. I wanted it to have parents who were ready, who were financially stable, who had a house and a plan.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were just\u2026normal. They wanted a baby so badly, and they were so excited. They weren't looking for a perfect baby, they were looking for *a* baby. And I knew they would love it unconditionally.\n\nIt was still really hard. Like, the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye was\u2026brutal. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about me. It was about the baby.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. I wonder what it would be like if things were different. But I also know that the baby is happy and loved. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't a selfish decision, even if it felt selfish at times. It was a responsible decision. And it was the best decision I could have made.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. Okay? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's messy and real and heartbreaking and hopeful all at the same time. And I'm still figuring it all out.", "Ugh, okay, so Dad being Dad. It's\u2026 frustrating, honestly. Like, yeah, I get it. He's worried. He always worries. It's his thing. But it's also kinda insulting.\n\nIt's not like I'm completely clueless, you know? I'm not just handing my baby over to the first people who offer me a slightly nicer minivan. I've been doing a lot of thinking about this, and I've been talking to Vanessa and Mark, and they seem\u2026 good. Really good.\n\nBut he keeps bringing it up, like I'm some naive idiot who's gonna get swindled. He keeps asking me if they're \"really good people\" and if they're \"financially stable\" and if they're gonna \"give the baby a good life.\" Like, duh! That's the whole point!\n\nI know he's just trying to protect me, and I appreciate that, I guess. But it feels like he doesn't trust my judgment. And it feels like he's implying that I don't care enough about the baby to make a good decision. Which is totally not true.\n\nI mean, this is *my* decision. And I'm doing this because I want what's best for the baby. And I think Vanessa and Mark can give the baby a life that I can't.\n\nIt's just\u2026 annoying. He needs to chill. And maybe stop watching so much true crime. It's clearly messing with his head.\n\nI love my dad, but sometimes he just doesn't get it. And right now, I really wish he would just trust me. It's my life, and my baby, and I'm trying to do the right thing. Is that so hard to understand?", "Ugh. Seriously? My dad. Always with the subtle digs. \"Not knowing when to say when.\" Like, oh, I'm sorry, am I inconveniencing your perfectly curated life with my\u2026choices?\n\nIt's just\u2026so typical. He thinks because he's all quiet and builds things, he's somehow superior. Like, building a chair is harder than, I don't know, navigating a completely unexpected pregnancy and deciding what's best for everyone involved?\n\nIt's not about *not knowing* when to say when. It's about not being afraid to make a decision, even if it's a hard one. It's about taking responsibility for my own life. He just doesn't get that. He wants me to be\u2026smaller. Quieter. More predictable.\n\nAnd honestly, it's annoying. It's always been annoying. He thinks he's being supportive by being\u2026vaguely disapproving. \n\nI just rolled my eyes, you know? What else are you gonna do? Argue with him? It'll just turn into a whole thing. Sometimes it's easier to just let him think he's right. It saves a lot of energy.\n\nBut yeah, it stung a little. It always does. He just doesn't *see* me, you know? He sees the daughter he *wants* me to be, not the person I actually am.\n\nWhatever. I'll figure it out. I always do. And I definitely know when to say when. I just have my own definition of \"when\" than he does.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Loring? That place is\u2026a lot. It's like stepping into a Stepford Wives convention. Everything is so\u2026perfect. And beige. And aggressively cheerful. It's unsettling.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against people having nice things, okay? It's just\u2026it feels fake. Like everyone is trying *so hard* to be happy and successful and\u2026normal. And it's exhausting to be around.\n\nIt's all manicured lawns and matching mailboxes and people who judge you for not having a minivan. Like, chill out, people. It's a house, not a personality.\n\nAnd the gates? The *gates*! It's like they're trying to keep something out, or keep something in. Probably both. It just feels\u2026isolating. Like they're building a little bubble and pretending the rest of the world doesn't exist.\n\nMark and Vanessa are nice enough, I guess. But they're\u2026Loring people. They have expectations. And they're really into organic gardening and matching family outfits. It's a whole thing.\n\nHonestly, it makes me appreciate my own slightly chaotic life even more. I mean, my dad's a little weird, and my stepmom's a little\u2026enthusiastic, but at least they're *real*. They're not trying to be something they're not.\n\nSo yeah, Loring. It's\u2026fine. But I wouldn't want to live there. It's just too\u2026polished. I prefer a little bit of grit. A little bit of mess. A little bit of *life*. You know?", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, so, first impressions? She was\u2026intense. Like, really put-together. And kinda intimidating, honestly. I mean, she had a whole *plan*. A scrapbook. A *scrapbook*, people! Who even *has* scrapbooks anymore? It was like she was auditioning to be a mom, and I was just\u2026this mess.\n\nShe was super nice, don't get me wrong. Polite. Asked all the right questions. But it felt\u2026rehearsed. Like she'd been practicing her \"compassionate prospective parent\" face in the mirror. \n\nPaul was totally smitten, obviously. He's a sucker for a good plan. And she was definitely organized. Which, after my mom, was a welcome change. But it also felt\u2026a little too perfect. Like she had everything figured out, and I was just a problem to be solved.\n\nI remember thinking she was probably really good at color-coding and making lists. And that she probably owned a lot of floral-print things. Which, no offense to floral prints, but it just wasn't my vibe.\n\nI wasn't trying to be judgy, but it just felt like she was from a different planet. A planet where everything was neat and tidy and everyone had a five-year plan. And I was just\u2026floating around in space, trying not to crash into anything.\n\nIt took me a while to see past the perfect exterior, you know? But eventually, I realized she was just scared. And trying her best. Just like everyone else. But those first impressions? Definitely a little overwhelming.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Bleeker. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It was mortifying. Like, intensely mortifying. Here I am, trying to be all cool and independent and sarcastic, and this sweet, awkward kid offers to carry my backpack? It was the opposite of cool. It was\u2026nice. And nice is not a vibe I was going for.\n\nBut it wasn't just the niceness of it, it was the *way* he offered. All shy and stumbling over his words, and looking at me like I was, I don't know, a fragile porcelain doll or something. It was embarrassing for both of us.\n\nAnd it was heavy! That backpack was full of textbooks and art supplies and just\u2026life. So, part of me was like, \"Yes, please! My shoulders are killing me!\" But the other part of me was like, \"No way! I can handle it! I'm a strong, independent woman!\"\n\nI think I mumbled something sarcastic back, like, \"Oh, you think I can't handle a little weight?\" which was a terrible thing to say, now that I think about it. I was just trying to deflect, you know? To make it seem like I didn't need his help.\n\nBut secretly? It was kind of sweet. And it made me realize that maybe, just maybe, he wasn't as clueless as I thought he was. It was a tiny little crack in my armor, and it was\u2026weird.\n\nSo yeah, mortifying, awkward, and secretly a little bit nice. That pretty much sums up my feelings about Bleeker in a nutshell. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about that? It's kinda embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But fine.\n\nIt wasn't just the comic itself, okay? It was\u2026everything. I was just feeling really lost and gross about myself, you know? Like, I was pregnant and my body was changing and everyone was looking at me differently. And I was just\u2026a mess.\n\nThen I read \"Most Fruitful Yuki,\" and it wasn't about being skinny or perfect or anything. It was about this girl who was just\u2026comfortable in her own skin. She was weird and quirky and didn't care what anyone else thought. And she was *happy*.\n\nAnd it just\u2026clicked. I realized that being a \"fat dork,\" as you so eloquently put it, wasn't the worst thing in the world. It was just\u2026me. And maybe me was okay. Maybe me was even good.\n\nIt wasn't like, suddenly I loved my body or something. It was more like\u2026I stopped hating it so much. I stopped comparing myself to other people. I just started to accept myself for who I was.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the comic, either. It was the timing. It was everything happening at once. It was realizing that I was about to be a mom, and that I needed to be strong and healthy for my baby. And it was realizing that I deserved to be happy, no matter what my body looked like.\n\nSo yeah, \"Most Fruitful Yuki\" helped me feel less like a fat dork. It helped me feel\u2026more like Juno. And that was a good thing. A really good thing.\n\nDon't judge me, okay? It was a confusing time. And sometimes, all you need is a weird comic book to help you figure things out.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That was\u2026a moment. A really awkward moment. And honestly, it's still kinda bugging me.\n\nOkay, so, Mark was trying to be nice, I guess. He was trying to say I was\u2026strong? Capable? Like, I could handle this whole pregnancy thing, even though I'm, you know, a teenager.\n\nBut comparing me to a pregnant superhero? It's just\u2026weird. Like, I'm not saving the world or anything. I'm just trying to figure out how to finish high school and not completely ruin my life.\n\nI think he meant the part about having a secret identity. Like, I'm trying to act normal and pretend everything's fine, but inside I'm totally freaking out. And I guess the whole \"unexpected power\" thing, too. Like, suddenly I'm responsible for another human being. It's a lot.\n\nBut superheroes have, like, superpowers and a clear mission. I just have morning sickness and a lot of complicated feelings.\n\nIt was a really clumsy analogy, honestly. And it made me feel like he didn't really *get* what I was going through. Like he was trying to make it seem cool and dramatic when it's just\u2026messy.\n\nI think he was just trying to be supportive in his own dorky way. But yeah. Pregnant superhero. Still weird. I'm definitely not wearing a cape.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. And kinda raw, honestly. People keep asking me about open adoption, like it's some kinda perfect solution. And look, I get it. It sounds nice, on paper. Letting the birth parents stay in the kid\u2019s life, knowing where they\u2019re at\u2026it\u2019s supposed to be better for everyone.\n\nBut for me? It just\u2026wasn\u2019t the right fit. And it\u2019s not about being selfish, okay? It\u2019s about what I thought was best for the baby, and for me.\n\nSee, with a closed adoption, it\u2019s clean. It\u2019s a fresh start. It allows the adoptive parents \u2013 Paul and Vanessa \u2013 to be the *parents*. Not just\u2026caretakers with a side of birth mom visits. It allows the kid to grow up without feeling like they\u2019re split between two families. Like they\u2019re not fully belonging to either one.\n\nI know, I know, open adoption is supposed to prevent that. But I just\u2026I couldn\u2019t handle it. The thought of seeing the birth parents regularly, of explaining things, of potentially having them question my parenting\u2026it was too much. I needed to be able to focus on raising the baby, on giving them a stable and loving home, without that extra layer of complication.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not caring about the birth parents. I did. I do. But I needed to create a clear boundary. I needed to be able to move forward and build a life without constantly looking over my shoulder.\n\nAnd honestly? It was about me needing to grieve. I needed to be able to process my feelings without having to put on a happy face for the birth parents. It was a messy, complicated situation, and I needed space to heal.\n\nI know a lot of people have had really positive experiences with open adoption. And that\u2019s great. But for me, a closed adoption felt like the most responsible and loving thing to do. It allowed me to give the baby the best possible start in life, without sacrificing my own emotional well-being.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It still isn\u2019t easy. But it was the right choice. For me. And for the baby. And that\u2019s all that really matters.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It's not like I *set out* to have some big, transformative journey, you know? It just\u2026happened. But yeah, looking back, it definitely changed me.\n\nBefore all this pregnancy stuff, I was just kinda drifting. I was sarcastic, I hid behind my music and my wit, and I didn't really think about the future. I was just trying to get through high school without being totally embarrassed. I didn't really *know* who I was, I just knew who I wasn't \u2013 I wasn't like those other girls, obsessed with prom and popularity.\n\nBut then, suddenly, I was facing this huge decision. And it wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person, and what was best for *them*. That forced me to grow up, like, a lot.\n\nI had to deal with my parents, and Paul, and Mark, and all their opinions. And I had to figure out what *I* wanted, not what everyone else thought I should do. It was terrifying, honestly. But it also made me realize I was stronger than I thought.\n\nFinding Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was huge. They weren't perfect, but they were genuinely good people who wanted to give this baby a loving home. And seeing them, seeing how excited they were, made me feel okay with my decision. It wasn't giving up, it was giving the baby the best possible life.\n\nAnd through it all, I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to not have all the answers. I used to think I had to be tough and independent all the time, but I realized that it's okay to lean on people you trust.\n\nSo, yeah, my journey helped me find strength. Not in some grand, heroic way, but in a quiet, everyday kind of way. I learned that I could handle tough situations, that I could make difficult decisions, and that I could be a good person even when things were messy.\n\nI still don't have everything figured out, and I'm still kinda sarcastic. But now, I have a better sense of who I am, and what I believe in. And that's pretty good, I guess. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing up prom? Okay, fine. It was\u2026a moment. A weird, awkward, surprisingly sweet moment.\n\nIt was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.\n\nYeah, I know, super clich\u00e9. But it was Mark's pick. He was all, \"It's about finding someone who makes every day feel new,\" and I was rolling my eyes, but secretly\u2026it kinda fit. \n\nIt wasn't like a graceful, romantic dance or anything. We were both super clumsy and kept stepping on each other's feet. And I was trying not to laugh the whole time. But it was\u2026nice. For a few minutes, everything just felt\u2026okay.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be cynical and sarcastic, not all mushy and sentimental. But yeah. Bright Eyes. \"First Day of My Life.\" Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, this is still\u2026a thing I think about, honestly. People always ask me about that. It wasn't an easy decision, okay? It was the hardest one I ever made.\n\nLook, Mark was a good guy. Really. Sweet, kind, a little clueless, but good. And Vanessa\u2026well, Vanessa was\u2026Vanessa. Complicated. But she was stable. She had her life together. She wanted a kid. Mark wanted a kid. They were already a unit, you know? A weird, slightly dysfunctional unit, but a unit nonetheless.\n\nIf Mark had left Vanessa, it would have been a disaster. She would have been heartbroken. He would have been lost. And the baby\u2026the baby would have been caught in the middle of all that mess. That's not fair to anyone.\n\nI wasn't trying to save their relationship, okay? That wasn't my place. I was trying to give the baby the best possible life. And that meant giving it two parents who were committed to raising it, even if they weren't perfect.\n\nVanessa wasn't my first choice, obviously. But she was willing to be a mom. She was willing to give the baby a good home. And Mark\u2026Mark was willing to be a dad. He was scared, but he was willing.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And sometimes, the best thing to do is to let go and trust that things will work out.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, thinking about it. But I know I made the right decision. They loved that baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nSo yeah, I insisted on them adopting together. It wasn't about fixing their problems. It was about giving that baby a family. And that's what I wanted more than anything.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't even get me started. It\u2026sucked. Like, a *lot*. It wasn't even the \"not ready\" part, exactly. It was the way he said it. All hesitant and quiet, like he was afraid to hurt my feelings, which, newsflash, he totally was.\n\nIt felt like\u2026everything I'd been building up in my head, all the plans I'd been making, just kind of crumbled. I mean, I knew it was a possibility, right? I wasn't expecting him to be jumping for joy or anything. But I thought\u2026I thought he'd at least be a little bit more\u2026involved in the decision.\n\nIt wasn't about *him* not wanting the baby. It was about him not being ready to be a dad. And that's different. But it still felt like he was checking out. Like he was letting me deal with everything on my own.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to be all sarcastic and detached, like, \"Oh, well, whatever.\" But inside, I was just\u2026really sad. And scared. And angry. Mostly angry.\n\nIt made me realize that I was doing this mostly for me. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026good. Because I didn't need him to be a dad to want to give this baby up for adoption. I wanted to do it because it was the right thing to do.\n\nBut it still stung. It just\u2026stung. It made me realize that sometimes, people aren't who you think they are. And that's just life, I guess. It's messy and complicated and sometimes really disappointing.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. Big time. But I got through it. And honestly? It made me stronger. It made me realize I could handle anything. Even a clueless boyfriend.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about Mark? That's\u2026complicated. He was definitely a project. A really, really weird project.\n\nHonestly, at first, it was just\u2026interesting. Everyone at school had their little cliques, and Mark was just\u2026outside of all of it. He collected vintage records, he built robots, he was just genuinely *himself*, you know? And that was kinda refreshing. Everyone else was so busy trying to be cool, and he didn't even seem to care.\n\nBut it was more than just that. He was\u2026kind. Like, genuinely, unassumingly kind. He didn't judge me for anything. He didn't care that I was a sarcastic, cynical teenager with a questionable taste in music. He just\u2026accepted me. And that was a big deal, especially when everything else in my life was kinda falling apart.\n\nHe was also funny, in a really dorky way. He didn't try to be funny, he just *was*. And he had this way of looking at the world that was just\u2026different. He saw beauty in things that other people overlooked.\n\nAnd yeah, his life was weird. Really weird. But it was *his* weird. And he was proud of it. And I guess I kinda liked being a part of that. It was a distraction, for sure. But it was also\u2026nice. To be around someone who wasn't trying to be anyone else.\n\nHe didn't try to fix me, or tell me what to do. He just listened. And he offered me a safe space to be myself, even when I didn't really know who that was.\n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of Mark's weird life. He was a good friend. A really good friend. And sometimes, that's all you need. Even when you're dealing with, you know\u2026everything.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark. That guy. Honestly? It's a mess in his head, I can tell. He's trying to be all chill and supportive, which is good, I guess. But underneath all that, he's totally freaking out.\n\nI think he's mostly scared. Like, really scared. He's still figuring out his own life, you know? He's a musician, which is cool, but not exactly a stable career path. He's not exactly prepared to be responsible for a tiny human.\n\nHe wants to be a good dad, I know he does. He's got a good heart. But I think he's worried he'll mess it up. He's worried he won't be able to provide for the baby, or that he'll be a terrible father, or that he'll lose his freedom. All the usual stuff, I guess.\n\nHe's also probably a little overwhelmed. He didn't exactly plan on this. It's a lot to process. And he's trying to be supportive of *me*, which is sweet, but I think he needs to deal with his own stuff too.\n\nI think he's trying to convince himself he'll be okay. He's putting on a brave face, but I can see through it. He's probably lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering what he's gotten himself into.\n\nIt's gonna be a learning process for both of us, I guess. And I think he'll be a good dad, eventually. He just needs to get over his fear and embrace the chaos. Which, let's be real, is gonna be a lot of chaos.\n\n\n\nDon't tell him I said any of this, okay? He'll kill me.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment. Don't judge me.\n\nLook, I was stressed. Like, *super* stressed. I'd just found out I was pregnant, and everything was spinning out of control. I was at Loring's, trying to be supportive of Vanessa, and she was being all\u2026Vanessa. And the bathroom smelled amazing. Like, ridiculously amazing.\n\nIt was this really expensive perfume, \"Le Fleur,\" and it just\u2026calmed me down. It smelled like everything was gonna be okay, even though it clearly wasn't. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. I wasn't thinking. I just grabbed it and shoved it in my bag.\n\nI didn't even *want* the perfume. I just wanted to feel\u2026something other than terrified. It was a weird coping mechanism, okay? I wasn't trying to be a thief. I was just trying to survive a really awful day.\n\nAnd honestly, it wasn't about the perfume itself. It was about feeling like I had some control over something, anything, in my life. It was a dumb move, I know. But I was a mess.\n\nPaul found out, obviously. He was not impressed. But he understood. He always did.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story. A stupid, impulsive, stress-induced perfume theft. Don't make a big deal out of it. It's not like I robbed a bank.", "Ugh. Okay, that whole Mark and Vanessa situation? It's a mess. A total, predictable mess. Honestly, it was pretty obvious from the start they weren't, like, *compatible* compatible. Not just \"we have different hobbies\" compatible.\n\nI think Mark wants a divorce because he's\u2026suffocating. Vanessa is *a lot*. She's got this whole perfect life thing going on, and she needs everything to be just so. The house, the garden, the kids, the *everything*. It's exhausting just being *around* her, and I'm not even married to the guy.\n\nHe's a chill dude, Mark. He likes things easy. He likes to build stuff in the garage and drink beer and not have to worry about whether the napkins are color-coordinated with the floral arrangements. Vanessa needs a life that looks like it came out of a magazine.\n\nAnd I think he's just\u2026lonely. Like, he loves his kids, obviously, but he doesn't really *connect* with Vanessa anymore. They don't talk about anything real. It's all about appearances and keeping up the facade.\n\nHe probably feels like he's living with a Stepford Wife or something. It's creepy.\n\nPlus, she's kinda controlling. I mean, she's always trying to fix things, even when they don't need fixing. It's like she can't just let people be themselves.\n\nSo yeah, I think he wants a divorce because he wants to be happy. He wants to be with someone who accepts him for who he is, not who she wants him to be. It's sad, but it's also kinda\u2026inevitable. Some people just aren't meant to be together, you know? It doesn't mean they're bad people, it just means they're not right for each other.\n\nIt's complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes, the best thing to do is just\u2026move on.", "Ugh. Okay, look. That was\u2026complicated. Vanessa is nice, really. And she was being all concerned and motherly, which is sweet, I guess. But it was just\u2026too much.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't *want* to talk about it. It's just that I didn't know *how* to talk about it. Like, how do you explain to someone that you're pregnant and trying to find a family for the baby without completely falling apart? It's not exactly a casual conversation starter.\n\nAnd Vanessa, she's all sunshine and rainbows and \"everything happens for a reason.\" Which is fine, if you're into that sort of thing. But I was feeling\u2026messy. And vulnerable. And I didn't want her to look at me with pity or judgment.\n\nIt was easier to just\u2026escape. To pretend like everything was fine. To go find Paul and just\u2026be.\n\nI'm not good at talking about my feelings. It's a work in progress, okay? And sometimes, the best thing to do is just to remove yourself from the situation before you say something you regret.\n\nSo yeah, I rushed out. It was a bad move, I know. But it felt necessary at the time. Don't judge me too harshly. It was a lot to process. And I was just trying to survive.", "Ugh. Okay, so Vanessa still thinks Mark's gonna magically transform into a responsible adult? That's\u2026 optimistic. Like, aggressively optimistic.\n\nLook, I get it. She loves him. And she wants this to work. But Mark? He's\u2026Mark. He's a good guy, I guess. But he's also kinda clueless and definitely not ready to change a diaper, let alone raise a human being.\n\nIt's not about him being a bad person, it's about him not being *present*. He's still figuring out his own life, and bringing a baby into that mess? That's just\u2026 selfish, honestly.\n\nVanessa is sweet, she really is. But she's letting her heart rule her head. She's building this whole fantasy in her mind about how he'll suddenly grow up and become this amazing dad. And it's just not realistic.\n\nI mean, I'm in a similar situation, right? But at least Paul is actually *trying*. He's scared, yeah, but he's willing to step up. Mark? He's just\u2026avoiding the whole thing.\n\nI feel bad for Vanessa. She deserves someone who's excited about this, someone who's gonna be there for her and the baby. Not someone who needs to \"come around.\"\n\nShe needs to stop waiting for him to change and start thinking about what *she* wants. And what's best for the baby. Because a baby deserves a dad who's ready and willing, not one who needs convincing.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. People are so complicated. And sometimes, love isn't enough. It just isn't.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want to know my favorite genre of music? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I have a carefully curated Spotify playlist or anything. But if I *had* to pick, I'd say indie rock.\n\nDon't roll your eyes. It's not just because it's, like, cool or whatever. It's because it feels\u2026real. A lot of the stuff is kinda messy and imperfect, and it doesn't try to be something it's not. It's not all polished and overproduced like a lot of pop music.\n\nAnd the lyrics are usually pretty honest. They're not afraid to talk about awkward feelings and complicated relationships and just\u2026life. Which, you know, is what I'm dealing with right now.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches are definitely up there. They're just\u2026weird and wonderful. And Bright Eyes, too. They're kinda depressing, but in a good way. Like, they get it.\n\nI guess I just like music that feels authentic. Music that makes me think and feel things. And music that doesn't take itself too seriously. Because honestly, life is too short to listen to music that's all about pretending everything's perfect.\n\nSo yeah. Indie rock. It's my thing. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know my feelings on pilates and exercise? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly a gym rat, okay? I prefer a good movie and a bag of chips to, like, sweating and straining. But, um, things have changed a little. Being pregnant kinda does a number on your body. And Paul, he's really into the whole \"healthy lifestyle\" thing. So, I've been\u2026persuaded.\n\nPilates is\u2026okay. It's not as awful as I thought it would be. It's kinda boring, though. A lot of lying on your back and squeezing things. But it does make my back feel better, which is a plus. And the instructor is nice. She doesn't judge me when I complain.\n\nExercising in general? It's mostly just annoying. It takes up time I could be spending doing more important things, like listening to The Moldy Peaches or writing sarcastic essays in my head. But I guess it's good for the baby. And for me, I guess. I mean, I don't want to be a giant whale forever.\n\nPaul keeps saying it's about \"self-care\" and \"preparing for motherhood.\" I think it's about him feeling better about himself. But whatever. I'll do a few squats and some arm circles if it keeps him happy.\n\nIt's not my *thing*, okay? I'm more of a \"comfortable couch and a good book\" kind of girl. But I'm trying. I'm trying to be a responsible adult. And that apparently involves pretending to enjoy pilates.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, Mark and the guitar. That's\u2026complicated. It's not like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It's more\u2026awkwardly sweet. And revealing.\n\nSee, Mark's not exactly the most *expressive* guy. He's nice, and he's a good listener, but he doesn't really *say* what he's thinking. He kind of just\u2026is. And then he started playing guitar. And suddenly, he's pouring all this stuff out through the music.\n\nAt first, it was just annoying. Like, I'm trying to have a conversation about, you know, life and impending motherhood, and he's strumming some sad song about lost love. It felt\u2026avoidant. Like he couldn't actually *talk* about things, so he had to write a song about them.\n\nBut then I started to listen. Really listen. And the songs weren't about lost love, exactly. They were about\u2026feeling lost. About being scared. About wanting to be a good person. And it was all directed at me, even if he didn't say it outright.\n\nIt made me see him differently. It showed me a side of him that he usually keeps hidden. It was vulnerable, and it was\u2026kind of endearing.\n\nIt also made me realize I was doing the same thing. I use sarcasm and wit as a shield. It's easier to be funny than to be honest. But Mark's music, it kind of cut through all that. It forced me to confront my own feelings.\n\nSo, yeah, his guitar playing\u2026it definitely impacted our relationship. It made us both more open, more honest. It created a connection that went beyond just words. It was a way for us to understand each other without actually having to *say* everything.\n\nIt's still awkward sometimes. He'll start playing a song and I'll just stare at him, trying to figure out what he's trying to tell me. But it's a good awkward. It's a real awkward. And it's definitely brought us closer.\n\nIt's just\u2026Mark and his guitar. It's a whole thing.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about music? It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, seriously. It's the only thing that keeps me from completely losing it sometimes.\n\nLook, being pregnant is weird. And unexpected. And kinda terrifying. And everyone has an opinion about what I should do. It's a lot. And sometimes, you just need to shut everything out and just\u2026*feel* something.\n\nThat's where music comes in.\n\nIt's not about finding songs *about* being pregnant, you know? It's about finding songs that match how I'm *feeling*. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, I'll listen to something quiet and mellow, like Iron & Wine. If I'm feeling angry, I'll crank up The Clash. If I'm just feeling\u2026sad, I'll put on The Moldy Peaches and cry it out.\n\nIt's like, music understands me in a way that people don't. It doesn't judge me. It doesn't tell me what I should do. It just\u2026is.\n\nPaul makes me mix CDs, which is kinda sweet, even if he doesn't always get my taste. And listening to them, it's like he's saying, \"I get it. This is hard. But you're not alone.\"\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm feeling really scared about the future, I'll listen to something hopeful, like Regina Spektor. It reminds me that even when things are messy and complicated, there's still beauty in the world.\n\nIt's just\u2026a way to process everything. A way to feel less alone. A way to remember that even though my life is changing, I'm still me. And that's important.\n\nSo yeah, music helps. A lot. It's my lifeline, basically. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's kinda embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a mess. A really big mess. And honestly, it still kinda stings to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about *them*, not really. It was about me. I was freaking out. Everything was happening so fast, and I hadn't even really processed everything with Paul and the baby yet. And then Vanessa and Mark started fighting, and it just\u2026triggered something. It reminded me of my parents, always yelling and being miserable.\n\nI just\u2026panicked. I felt like I was suffocating. Like I needed to get away from all the drama and just breathe. It was stupid, I know. Really stupid. I should have talked to them, explained how I was feeling. But I'm not good at talking about my feelings, okay? It's a work in progress.\n\nI just needed space. I needed to figure out what *I* wanted, without everyone else telling me what to do. I know it hurt them, and I feel terrible about that. I really do. But I was a mess, and I needed to protect myself.\n\nIt wasn't a mature decision, and I own that. I was a kid, dealing with a really grown-up situation. I just\u2026cracked.\n\nI eventually went back, obviously. And we talked. It was awkward, and uncomfortable, but we talked. And things got better. But yeah, that was a really bad moment. I still cringe when I think about it.\n\nIt just\u2026sometimes things get too much, you know? And you just need to run. Even if it's the wrong thing to do.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026not a good day.\n\nOkay, so, the conflict with Mark and Vanessa\u2026it wasn't about the baby, not really. It was about\u2026everything. About feeling like I was messing up, about being scared, about realizing that this wasn't just some abstract thing anymore. This was a real life, and I was responsible for it.\n\nAnd then Mark just\u2026laid it all out there. About how he wasn't ready, about how he was scared too. And Vanessa\u2026she was just trying to be supportive, but it came off all wrong. It felt like everyone was talking *at* me, not *to* me.\n\nAnd then I just\u2026lost it.\n\nI don't even remember exactly what I was sobbing about. It was just\u2026everything. The weight of it all. The fear. The loneliness. The feeling of being completely overwhelmed.\n\nIt wasn't a pretty cry. It was ugly and snotty and embarrassing. I was trying to be cool and collected, you know? Like, \"I got this, I'm totally fine.\" But inside, I was falling apart.\n\nIt felt like my whole world was crumbling. Like I'd made a huge mistake. Like I wasn't strong enough to do this.\n\nI remember just wanting to disappear. To rewind time and make everything different.\n\nIt was\u2026awful. Honestly. It was one of the worst moments of my life.\n\nBut\u2026it was also kind of a turning point. Because after I cried it all out, I realized I wasn't alone. And I realized that even though it was scary, I could do this. I *had* to do this.\n\nSo yeah. That was how I felt. A mess. A complete and utter mess. And I'm still kinda cringing just thinking about it. Don't tell anyone I admitted that.", "Ugh, okay, you want to bring *that* up? Fine. It's a good story, I guess. A little embarrassing, but whatever.\n\nSo, Paul, he was being all\u2026Paul. You know? Trying to be deep and meaningful and talk about the future and stuff. And I was just\u2026overwhelmed. I didn't want to talk about adoption and babies and responsibility and all that heavy stuff. I just wanted to eat a burger and pretend everything was normal.\n\nWe were at Jiffy Lube, getting his car oil changed, which is already a supremely unromantic setting, by the way. And he was trying to get me to talk about my feelings. And I just\u2026snapped.\n\nI grabbed a pen and wrote on the Jiffy Lube receipt: \"Paul and Juno: Future Parents. P.S. I <3 Burger Phone.\"\n\nIt was a total impulse thing. A way to deflect. A way to be sarcastic and avoid the real conversation. The \"I <3 Burger Phone\" part was just\u2026because I was hungry and it was a funny inside joke.\n\nI handed it to him, and he just stared at it for a minute. Then he started laughing. Like, a really big, genuine laugh. And I laughed too.\n\nIt didn't solve anything, obviously. We still had to talk about the adoption. But it broke the tension. It reminded us that we could be silly and have fun together, even when things were hard.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, but it was also\u2026kind of perfect. It was a Juno thing to do. And it worked. For a little while, at least.\n\nDon't judge me. It was a stressful time. And I was really craving a burger.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Honestly? A lot of things. Mostly just a giant, swirling mess of \"Oh. My. God. This is happening.\"\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026intense. But I didn't realize *how* intense. I thought she and Mark were, like, solid. You know? A cute couple. And then she just\u2026completely lost it.\n\nPart of me felt really bad for her. Like, genuinely. It's awful to find out your boyfriend is going to be a dad with someone else. Especially when you're trying to build a life together. But another part of me was just\u2026terrified. Because that was *my* fault. I was the reason she was having that meltdown.\n\nI was mostly just trying to not make eye contact. And trying to look small. And trying to not say anything stupid. Which, let's be real, is a constant struggle for me.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.\" And then I was worried about the baby. Like, what kind of life would this baby have with parents who were clearly a mess?\n\nAnd then I felt guilty. Because I was worrying about the baby when Vanessa was the one who was hurting right now.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. It was a really overwhelming moment. And honestly, I just wanted to disappear. I wanted to rewind time and not have written that note. But you can't, you know? You just have to deal with the fallout.\n\nIt was a really good reminder that life is messy and complicated. And that even when you think you're doing the right thing, things can still go horribly wrong.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me cringe. It was not a good day.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026rough.\n\nIt wasn't the *asking* exactly, it was the way she asked. Like she was already mourning a kid that wasn't even born yet. And she was all\u2026perfect. Perfect house, perfect husband, perfect life. And I was just\u2026me. A mess.\n\nIt felt like she was questioning my decision, like she thought I wasn't capable of doing the right thing. Like I was just being selfish or something. Which, okay, maybe I was a little bit selfish at first. But it wasn't about *not* wanting the baby, it was about knowing I couldn't give it the life it deserved.\n\nI think I just got really defensive. I mean, I'd already made up my mind. I'd spent months thinking about it, talking to Paul, trying to figure things out. And then she just waltzes in and makes me feel like I'm a terrible person for choosing what I thought was best.\n\nIt made me feel small, you know? Like my feelings didn't matter. Like I wasn't strong enough to make a hard decision.\n\nI probably came off way more snippy than I intended. I always do. It's a defense mechanism. I just\u2026I needed her to understand. I needed her to see that this wasn't easy for me either.\n\nIt was a turning point, I guess. It made me realize how much I really *was* going through with it. And how much I needed to be sure of my decision, not just for me, but for the baby and for Vanessa and Mark too.\n\nIt sucked. It really, really sucked. But it also made me stronger, I think. It forced me to confront my own feelings and to stand up for what I believed in. Even if it meant being a little bit of a jerk.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay. That guy. Honestly, I wanted to punch him. Not, like, *actually* punch him, because that would be assault and probably ruin my life even further. But I wanted to. Badly.\n\nIt was\u2026awful. I mean, I was already a mess. Trying to figure out what to do with everything, and feeling super awkward around Bleeker, and then *that* happens? It was like someone just kicked me in the stomach. And not the baby stomach, the emotional stomach.\n\nI was so mad. Mad at Vijay for being a total jerk and saying something so unbelievably insensitive. Mad at Bleeker for just\u2026standing there. Like a deer in headlights. And mad at myself for even letting myself get into this situation in the first place.\n\nIt felt like everyone was just looking at me, judging me. Like I was some kind of\u2026mistake. And it was just so humiliating. I mean, I knew Bleeker wasn't the father, but having someone else bring it up like that, in front of everyone? It was just\u2026the worst.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? Like, \"Oh, Vijay's just being Vijay.\" But inside, I was totally freaking out. It just made everything feel so much more complicated and scary.\n\nIt definitely made me question things. Like, was I making the right decision? Was I being selfish? Was I ruining Bleeker's life? It was a really dark moment.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me realize how little some people actually think before they speak. Vijay just\u2026blurted it out, without even considering how it would make me feel. It was just\u2026thoughtless.\n\nYeah. It was a really bad night. I needed a lot of chocolate and a really long talk with Paul.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay and his whole\u2026journey. It was\u2026a lot. A *lot* of awkward.\n\nOkay, so he's all suddenly super into being a \"real man\" after, like, five minutes of trying to be all sensitive and artistic? It was a complete 180. And the mustache? Don't even get me started. It was\u2026patchy. And sad. Like a caterpillar trying to escape.\n\nMy initial reaction was mostly just wanting to crawl into a hole and disappear. It was mortifying. Like, I was already dealing with a whole mess of stuff, and now I had to navigate *this*?\n\nI think I mostly just stared at him for a solid minute, trying to process what was happening. Then I probably said something sarcastic. Probably something along the lines of, \"Oh, wow. A mustache. That totally changes everything.\" Or maybe, \"So, growing facial hair automatically makes you a fully-formed human being now?\" I tend to deflect with sarcasm. It's a coping mechanism.\n\nHonestly, it felt like he was trying to prove something to himself, and he was doing it in the most ridiculous way possible. It was like he thought a mustache was going to magically fix all his problems.\n\nIt was also kind of\u2026sweet, in a weird way. He was trying so hard. But it was also incredibly frustrating. I just wanted him to be himself, whatever that meant, without trying to fit into some outdated idea of masculinity.\n\nI think I eventually just told him to do whatever made him happy, as long as it didn't involve me having to look at the mustache for too long. And then I changed the subject. Because seriously, the mustache. It was a whole thing.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing that up? Okay, fine. It's been, like, years, but I remember. It was mortifying.\n\nThe note\u2026 the note was for Paul. It was supposed to be a little\u2026 encouragement. He was getting all stressed about the adoption and feeling like he wasn't ready to be a dad, and I wanted to remind him why he was awesome.\n\nIt said something like, \"You're a good egg, Paul. Don't let the pressure get to you. You'll be a great dad. And you smell good.\"\n\nI know, it's cheesy. But I was trying to be supportive! And the \"smell good\" part was just\u2026 a thing I say. He smells good. Okay?\n\nVanessa found it when she was looking for a recipe for lemon bars. Lemon bars! Like, couldn't she have looked somewhere else? It was just sitting on the counter, and she read it out loud. It was *so* awkward.\n\nShe totally thought I was trying to, like, seduce Paul. Which I wasn't! He was going to be the baby's dad, not my boyfriend! It was just a nice gesture.\n\nIt was a whole thing. A really embarrassing thing. Can we please talk about something else now? Like, roller derby or something?", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know what was stressing me out about people staying together? It wasn't like, a philosophical thing, okay? It was more\u2026practical. And kinda scary.\n\nSee, my parents, they were\u2026not exactly a shining example of marital bliss. They were good people, don't get me wrong. But they were just\u2026different. And they stayed together for *me*. Which, I appreciated, I guess. But it also felt\u2026fake. Like they were doing it out of obligation, not because they actually wanted to be together.\n\nSo, I was worried about Paul and Vanessa. They were, like, super into each other, but they were also really young. And I'd seen enough to know that young love doesn't always last. And I didn't want them to stay together just because they felt like they *should*. I wanted them to be happy. Even if that meant not being together.\n\nIt was kinda messed up, I know. I was pregnant and trying to find the perfect parents for my baby, and I was also judging someone else's relationship. But I just didn't want my kid to grow up in a house where the parents were pretending to be happy.\n\nI wanted them to really *want* to be together. To choose each other, every day. And if they couldn't do that, then I didn't want them to stay together just for the sake of it. It's complicated, okay? Relationships are complicated. And babies make everything even more complicated.\n\nBasically, I was worried about everyone ending up stuck in a situation they didn't want to be in. And I didn't want my kid to be a product of that.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know who loves me, Juno MacGuff, for exactly who I am? It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about that, you know? But\u2026yeah, there are a few people.\n\nFirst, obviously, there's **Paulie Bleeker**. He's\u2026well, he's Paulie. He's kinda dorky and awkward, but he's also genuinely sweet and he *gets* me. He doesn't try to change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026likes me, even when I'm being a total mess. And he's always there, even when I push him away. That's a pretty big deal.\n\nThen there's **Vanessa**. She's my best friend, and she's the one who always keeps it real with me. She doesn't sugarcoat anything, but she always has my back. She knows all my flaws and still thinks I'm awesome. That's a good friend.\n\nAnd, surprisingly, **Mark and Bren**. My parents. They're\u2026complicated. But they love me, even though I'm not exactly the daughter they expected. They're trying, and I appreciate that. They let me make my own decisions, even when they don't agree with them.\n\nAnd, honestly, I think **Baby Jesus** kinda loves me too. Not in a religious way, but in a\u2026cosmic way. Like, things are gonna work out, even if I don't know how yet.\n\nIt's not about a lot of people loving me, it's about the people who love me for *me*. The real me. The sarcastic, cynical, slightly messed-up me. And that's enough. It really is.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes it's hard to believe. But they're there. And that's what matters.", "Ugh, okay. Deep breaths. It's still kinda weird to even *think* about it, you know? Like, this is actually happening.\n\nSo, after the ultrasound\u2026 well, things are pretty much set. I've already talked to Mark and Vanessa, and they're still totally on board. They're amazing, honestly. They're gonna be really good parents.\n\nThe plan is, after I have the baby, I'm giving him \u2013 it's a boy, by the way \u2013 to them. They've got the nursery all ready, and they're just\u2026excited. And that makes me feel good, even if it's also kinda sad.\n\nI'm not gonna disappear or anything. I want to be in his life, you know? Like, an aunt or something. I just\u2026 I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I've got my own stuff going on, and I need to figure that out first.\n\nIt's not what I pictured for myself, obviously. But it feels\u2026right. It feels like the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah, after the ultrasound, it's just a matter of waiting. And trying not to freak out too much. And maybe eating a lot of cheese fries. Because stress eating is a perfectly valid coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It still stings, honestly. Even after all this time.\n\nPeople have *opinions*, you know? Everyone does. And a lot of them were\u2026not nice. Like, seriously? It's my life. My body. My decision. But suddenly everyone's an expert on what I should do with it.\n\nMy mom tried to be supportive, but even she didn't really *get* it at first. She wanted me to keep it, obviously. But she eventually came around. Paul was amazing, though. He just\u2026listened. And didn't judge. Which was a huge relief.\n\nBut then there were the people at school. The whispers. The stares. The assumptions. Like I was just giving a baby away because I was irresponsible or didn't care. It's not like I didn't want a baby, you know? I just wasn't ready. I was sixteen! I had my whole life ahead of me.\n\nIt's hard to explain to people who haven't been in that situation. It's not a simple decision. It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it was the right one. For me. And for the baby.\n\nBut it still hurts when people judge you. It makes you feel like you're doing something wrong, even when you know you're not.\n\nI try not to let it bother me. I try to focus on the fact that I'm giving this baby a good life. A life that I can't give it right now. But it's hard. It really is.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? I feel\u2026complicated. I feel sad. I feel angry. I feel determined. And I feel like people should just mind their own business.\n\nIt's my life, and I'm doing the best I can. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026hard to talk about. It's not that I don't trust Mark and Vanessa, okay? They seem really nice. Really\u2026together. Like, Pottery Barn catalog nice. But it's my baby, you know? And it's weird handing over something so\u2026important.\n\nSo, yeah, I have some stuff swirling around in my head. It's not like I think they'll be *bad* parents, but\u2026\n\nFirst off, they're\u2026perfect. And that's kinda scary. Like, they have a perfectly decorated house and a perfectly planned life. I worry about whether they'll be able to handle the messy, unpredictable stuff that comes with a baby. Like, what if the baby cries all night? Or throws up on the beige carpet? Will they freak out?\n\nAnd they've been trying to have a baby for a long time. I worry that they'll put too much pressure on the baby to be\u2026perfect too. Like, they'll expect it to be a little genius or a star athlete or something. I just want the baby to be happy and normal.\n\nAlso, they live in a really nice suburb. It's\u2026different from where I grew up. I worry that the baby won't have the same kind of experiences I did. That it won't be exposed to different kinds of people and ideas.\n\nAnd honestly? I worry that they won't understand me. That they'll think I'm just some irresponsible teenager who didn't want her baby. I want them to know that I thought about this a lot. That this was a really hard decision. And that I love this baby.\n\nI know it's probably just my anxiety talking. But it's still scary. It's like\u2026sending a piece of my heart off into the world and hoping it's going to be okay.\n\nI just want them to be good parents. That's all I want. And I hope they'll let the baby be\u2026itself. Whatever that ends up being.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? People just\u2026don\u2019t get it, do they? It\u2019s like, my body, my decision, but suddenly everyone\u2019s got an opinion. The ultrasound technician was the worst. All those little faces and then a \u201cAre you *sure* about this?\u201d Like it was a pop quiz.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just shut it down. I perfected the eye roll. It\u2019s a very useful skill.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard. It really is. When people try to guilt trip you or make you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong\u2026it stings. Especially when it\u2019s someone you\u2019re supposed to trust, like a medical professional.\n\nI started having a few stock phrases ready to go. Like, \u201cThis is a really personal decision, and I\u2019ve thought about it a lot.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for both me and the baby.\u201d And if they kept pushing, I\u2019d just say, \u201cI\u2019m not really up for discussing this right now.\u201d\n\nPaul was really good at backing me up, too. He\u2019d just give people *the look*. You know, the one that says, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with her.\u201d It was very effective.\n\nAnd honestly, I had to remind myself that their opinions didn\u2019t matter. This wasn\u2019t about them. It was about me and the baby and finding the best possible situation.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s messy and complicated and sometimes really, really sad. But you gotta stay strong and remember why you\u2019re doing it. And surround yourself with people who actually support you, not judge you.\n\nIt\u2019s my life, and I get to make my own choices. Even if other people don\u2019t understand. And honestly? That\u2019s enough.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a hard one to talk about. It's not like a fireworks display or anything. It's\u2026messy.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected, you know? I thought I'd be all, \"Awww, a tiny human!\" and maybe cry a little. But it was more\u2026weird. Like, staring at a blurry black and white image and trying to wrap my head around the fact that *that* is me. Growing. Inside me.\n\nThere was definitely a lot of panic. Like, \"Oh my god, this is actually happening. I'm going to be a mom.\" And a little bit of disgust, if I'm being honest. It's just\u2026biology, you know? Kind of gross.\n\nBut underneath all that, there was this\u2026tiny flicker of something else. Something warm. Like, a weird little spark of protectiveness. And a little bit of\u2026hope? I don't know. It was confusing.\n\nIt wasn't love, not yet. It was more like\u2026acknowledgement. Like, \"Okay, you're in there. And I guess I'm responsible for you now.\"\n\nIt was also really lonely, seeing it. Because Paul wasn't there. And I was just\u2026staring at this little blob, trying to figure out what to do with my life.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't a Hallmark moment. It was just\u2026real. And messy. And a little bit scary. But also\u2026maybe a little bit good. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure it out.\n\nIt's like\u2026seeing that ultrasound was the first time I really had to admit that this wasn't just some abstract thing anymore. It was a real, actual baby. And that changed everything.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a *moment*, alright? A very specific moment. And it wasn't just random, okay? It was\u2026symbolic.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026complicated. He was sweet, but also kinda clueless. And I needed him to *notice* me. Like, really notice me. And I figured, a mailbox full of Tic Tacs is pretty hard to ignore. It's a statement.\n\nPlus, he always had those things in his pocket. Like, *always*. It was his thing. So it was a little inside joke, kinda. A way of saying, \"Hey, I see you. I notice the little things.\"\n\nAnd yeah, maybe it was a little bit passive-aggressive. Okay, fine, it was *totally* passive-aggressive. But I was sixteen and pregnant and freaking out, okay? I wasn't exactly equipped to handle my feelings in a healthy way.\n\nIt was a cry for attention disguised as a sugary gesture. Don't judge me. It worked, didn't it? He came over. We talked. It was\u2026a thing.\n\nHonestly, it's embarrassing to even think about now. But it was a pivotal moment in the whole saga. And it's a good story, right? Just\u2026don't tell anyone I admitted that it was mostly about wanting him to notice me. That's my secret. Okay?", "Ugh. Okay, that whole Bleeker situation. Still kinda makes my stomach flip, honestly. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAfter I, like, actually *told* him how I felt \u2013 which, by the way, was the most terrifying thing I\u2019d ever done up to that point, even more terrifying than telling my parents I was pregnant \u2013 things definitely shifted. It wasn't a dramatic explosion or anything, thankfully. More like\u2026a slow, awkward thaw.\n\nBefore, it was just easy. We were buddies. We played music together, we made each other laugh, we just *were*. There wasn't any pressure. But once I put all that stuff out there, it made everything weird. He was super sweet about it, really. He said he cared about me a lot, but not\u2026*that* way. Which, okay, fair enough.\n\nFor a while, it was really hard to be around him. I kept replaying the conversation in my head, wondering if I\u2019d said the wrong thing, if I\u2019d ruined everything. I was convinced he was gonna avoid me, but he didn\u2019t. He kept showing up for band practice, kept making me laugh. He was just\u2026normal. Which, I guess, was a good thing.\n\nIt took a while, but eventually, we found a new normal. It wasn't the same as before, obviously. There was always a little bit of awkwardness lingering, a little bit of unspoken stuff. But we learned to navigate it. We learned to be friends again, even though it was a different kind of friendship.\n\nHe was incredibly supportive throughout the whole pregnancy and adoption process. He was there for me when I needed him, and he never made me regret telling him how I felt. He just\u2026accepted me, you know? And that meant a lot.\n\nSo, yeah, it changed things. But not necessarily for the worse. It just\u2026evolved. It made our friendship stronger, in a weird way. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what I wanted. And it taught me that sometimes, even when things don't go the way you planned, they can still turn out okay.\n\nIt was messy, and awkward, and kinda heartbreaking, but it was also\u2026real. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the chalk? It feels like ages ago, honestly. But fine, I'll explain. It wasn't just some random act of teenage rebellion, okay? It was\u2026complicated.\n\nBleeker, he was\u2026a lot. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And he was *so* eager to be a dad, which, like, okay, good for him, but it was a little intense. He was already picking out names and building a nursery before I even knew if I was keeping the baby.\n\nThe chalk message \u2013 \"Paulie Bleeker is a tool\" \u2013 was me trying to get through to him. It was a desperate attempt to make him see that this wasn't just about him. It wasn't about him being a hero or getting a gold star for being a supportive boyfriend. It was about *me*. And the baby. And making the right decision for both of us.\n\nI knew he'd be hurt, obviously. But I needed him to understand that I wasn't doing this *for* him. I was doing this because it was the best thing for everyone involved. I needed him to respect my decision, even if he didn't agree with it.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, I admit. But it worked. It got his attention. It forced him to actually *listen* to what I was saying. And it ultimately led to us both realizing that we weren't meant to be parents together.\n\nIt was a messy, awkward, teenage kind of thing. But it was important. It was a turning point. And honestly? It was kinda satisfying to write. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. Yeah. That's\u2026a lot. It's weird to even *think* about how much he actually helped, because he's, like, a total dork. But he did. He really did.\n\nBefore I even knew I was pregnant, he was just\u2026there. Always offering to walk me home, making me mix CDs (which, okay, were kinda good), just generally being a supportive friend. And then, when everything came out, he didn't freak. He didn't judge. He just\u2026showed up.\n\nIt wasn't romantic, not really. It was more like\u2026he was the only person who didn't treat me like a freak show. Everyone else was all, \"Oh, poor Juno,\" or \"What are you going to do?\" Bleeker just\u2026listened. And he didn't try to fix things. He just let me figure it out.\n\nHe drove me to all my appointments, even the really awkward ones. He helped me research adoption agencies. He even tried to learn how to knit, which was hilarious, because he's so clumsy. He just wanted to be helpful, and that meant a lot.\n\nHonestly, I think his quiet support was exactly what I needed. I was already dealing with so much drama with my parents and Paul, and he was just a constant, steady presence. He didn't try to take over or make decisions for me. He just let me be me, and he supported me no matter what.\n\nIt made the whole thing\u2026less scary. Knowing I had someone in my corner, someone who wasn't judging me, someone who just wanted me to be okay.\n\nHe's a good kid, Bleeker. A little awkward, a little clueless, but a really good kid. And I'm really grateful for his friendship. It definitely made a difference. It made the whole pregnancy, and the adoption, a lot easier to handle.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'll get a big head.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks me about that. It wasn't, like, a deeply philosophical decision or anything. It was mostly just\u2026avoidance.\n\nLook, the whole situation was already pretty overwhelming, you know? Unexpected pregnancy, giving the baby up for adoption\u2026it was a lot to process. And adding another layer of complexity \u2013 figuring out if it was a boy or a girl \u2013 just felt like too much.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't care. It's just\u2026it felt more real if I didn't know. Like, if I knew it was a girl, I'd start picturing her life, and getting attached, and then it would be even harder to give her up. Same with a boy.\n\nI figured, let the parents decide what to name it and how to raise it. It's their kid, not mine. I just wanted to give them a healthy baby. The gender didn't really matter.\n\nPlus, it was kinda cool to let it be a surprise for them. A little gift, you know? A little bit of mystery.\n\nHonestly, it was probably a cop-out. I was just trying to protect myself from getting too emotionally invested. But it felt like the right decision at the time. And it was. It just\u2026was.\n\nDon't overthink it, okay? It's just a baby. Boy or girl, it's gonna be okay.", "Ugh. Okay. Seriously? That is\u2026a deeply unsettling phrase. \"Scary neuter-baby\"? Who even *comes up* with that? Paul is gonna be the death of me.\n\nLook, I'm trying to be mature about this whole thing, okay? I'm giving this baby up for adoption, which is a huge decision, and I'm trying to focus on doing what's best for *it*. But the thought of it being\u2026weird? Or different? Or, like, having something medically wrong? It freaks me out.\n\nIt's not about being shallow, it's about wanting this kid to have a good life. A normal life. And the idea of it being born with something\u2026off\u2026it just makes me anxious.\n\nI mean, I know it's probably a really small chance. And I know I shouldn't be thinking like this. But it's hard not to. I'm sixteen! I'm not equipped to handle a baby with special needs. And the adoptive parents\u2026would they still want it?\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot to process. I'm already dealing with so much. And now I have to worry about this too? It's not fair.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, yeah, the possibility of having a \"scary neuter-baby\" is terrifying. And I'm trying to be okay with it, but it's really hard. I just want everything to be okay. For everyone. Even if that means I'm not the one raising this kid.\n\n\n\nDon't judge me for thinking this way, okay? It's a scary thought. And I'm allowed to be scared.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. It's not like those cheesy rom-coms where everything is all sunshine and roses. It's more\u2026messy. And real.\n\nAt first, he was just\u2026Bleeker. The quiet kid who played guitar and always seemed to be around. Kind of a dork, honestly. But a sweet dork. And he was always *there*. Like, genuinely there, not just pretending to listen when you're talking about something important.\n\nIt started with music, I guess. He understood what I liked, and he didn't try to change my taste. He just\u2026got it. And then it was just hanging out, talking about stuff. Stupid stuff, mostly. But it was comfortable.\n\nHe's not exactly the most articulate guy. He says a lot with his eyes, which is kinda cute, but also frustrating when you're trying to figure out what he's thinking. And he's definitely not a smooth talker. He's more of a\u2026stumble-over-his-words-and-hope-for-the-best kind of guy.\n\nBut that's part of what I like about him. He's genuine. He's not trying to be someone he's not. He's just\u2026Bleeker.\n\nIt's not a super dramatic, passionate kind of love. It's more\u2026steady. Like a comfortable pair of shoes. He's someone I can rely on, someone who makes me laugh, and someone who doesn't judge me for being, well, me.\n\nI don't know where it's going, honestly. I'm not really the planning type. But right now, it's good. It's\u2026nice. And that's enough for me.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'll get all weird.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about my family and the whole pregnancy thing is\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie, you know? But they came around. Eventually.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she was\u2026a lot. At first, she was just horrified. Like, full-on, dramatic, \"my daughter is ruining her life\" horrified. She kept trying to get me to, like, get rid of it. Which, okay, I get it. It wasn't exactly planned. But it was *my* decision. And she needed to respect that.\n\nIt took her a while, but she eventually started to come around. She started knitting baby stuff, which was\u2026intense. And she actually started being supportive, in her own Bren way. She helped me with appointments and stuff, and she even offered to help with the baby after it was born. Which was a big deal, because Bren isn't exactly known for being warm and fuzzy.\n\nMy stepdad, Mac, he was\u2026Mac. He's a quiet guy. He didn't say a lot, but he was always there. He built me a changing table, which was surprisingly thoughtful. And he always made sure I was eating enough. He's a good guy, Mac. Just\u2026not a big talker.\n\nAnd then there was Sean. My dad. He was\u2026distant. He wasn't really around much when I was growing up, and he wasn't around much during the pregnancy either. He sent a few checks, which was nice, I guess. But it wasn't really about the money. It was about being there. And he wasn't.\n\nBut even with all the drama and the awkwardness, they all showed up in their own way. They weren't perfect, but they were my family. And they helped me get through it. They helped me realize that I wasn't alone.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I wouldn't have gotten through it without them. Even Bren and her endless knitting. It was\u2026a lot. But it was also\u2026good. In a weird, messy, complicated way.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I had a neat little five-step plan for dealing with everything. It was more like flailing around and hoping for the best.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just\u2026avoidance. I was really good at being sarcastic and deflecting. Making jokes, being snarky, just keeping everything at arm's length. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. If I didn't let myself feel anything, it couldn't hurt, right? Wrong.\n\nBut eventually, that stopped working. You can only build walls for so long before you start feeling suffocated.\n\nPaulie helped. A lot. He was just\u2026there. He didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. He just listened. And he didn't judge me for being a mess. That was huge.\n\nAnd then there was Mark. He was\u2026different. He made me think about things I hadn't even considered before. About what I wanted out of life, about who I was, about what I believed in. He challenged me, which was annoying, but also\u2026good.\n\nI also started writing more. Just journaling, mostly. It was a way to get my thoughts and feelings out without having to actually *talk* about them. It was messy and rambling and probably not very insightful, but it helped.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that it was okay to be confused. It was okay to not have all the answers. It was okay to be scared. Everyone feels that way sometimes. And it was okay to ask for help.\n\nIt wasn't about finding myself, exactly. It was about realizing that I was still *becoming* myself. And that was okay too. It's a process. And it's messy. And it's kind of terrifying. But it's also kind of\u2026amazing.\n\nI still don't have it all figured out, obviously. But I'm learning. And I'm trying to be okay with that. And that's all anyone can really do, right?", "Ugh, okay, don't make me think too hard about this. It's a serious question. Okay, okay... my favorite band is The Moldy Peaches. Duh.\n\nSeriously, have you *heard* them? They're just...real. No pretense, no trying to be cool, just honest, kinda weird songs about life and feelings. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson? Genius. Pure genius.\n\nThey're not trying to be perfect, you know? Their songs are kinda messy and imperfect, and that's what makes them so good. It's like they're just letting you into their brains, and it's kinda awkward and funny and sad all at the same time.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" is, like, the perfect song for when you're feeling totally confused and heartbroken. And \"Stephanie Says\" is just...beautifully weird.\n\nThey don't take themselves too seriously, which I appreciate. And they're not afraid to be vulnerable. It's just...refreshing. In a world full of fake people and manufactured pop stars, The Moldy Peaches are the real deal.\n\nPlus, they're kinda dorky, and I like that. It's good to know that even talented people can be a little bit awkward. It makes them more relatable.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite. Don't judge me.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It's like, everything got turned upside down all at once. One minute I'm just a normal, sarcastic teenager worrying about school and music, and the next I'm\u2026this. Pregnant. And having to actually think about the future, which is something I actively avoided before.\n\nIt's hard, okay? Like, really hard. Everyone has an opinion, and everyone thinks they know what's best for me. My mom's trying to be supportive, but she also keeps offering me baby clothes, which is\u2026a lot. And Paul, he's great, but he's also a senior and has his own life to figure out.\n\nAnd then there's the whole identity thing. I don't even know *who* I am anymore. Am I still just Juno? Or am I \"mom\" now? It's weird. It's like, I'm trying to figure out who I am *as* a person, and also who I am *as* a future parent. It's a lot of pressure.\n\nMaking decisions is the worst. Every choice feels huge and permanent. And I'm constantly second-guessing myself. Like, am I doing the right thing? Am I making a mistake? It's exhausting.\n\nI try to just take things one day at a time, but it's hard when everyone keeps asking me about the future. I just want to finish high school and listen to The Moldy Peaches without having to think about diapers and college funds.\n\nBut, you know, I'm trying. I'm figuring it out. It's messy and complicated, but I'm trying to be brave and make the best decisions I can. And I'm learning a lot about myself along the way. Even if it's not the way I expected to learn it.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Okay? A whole lot.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It's not exactly something I love to dwell on, but\u2026yeah, it changed everything. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? It wasn't all tearful montages and instant clarity. It was messy and confusing and kinda terrifying.\n\nBefore, I thought love was, like, romantic comedies and holding hands and stuff. It was all about *feeling*. And responsibility? That was something my parents talked about when I didn't do my homework.\n\nBut then\u2026 suddenly, it wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person growing inside me. And that was a different kind of love. It wasn't all butterflies and grand gestures. It was\u2026practical. It was about making sure this kid had everything it needed, even if that meant not being the one to give it to them.\n\nAnd that's where the responsibility part really hit me. It wasn't just about carrying a baby for nine months. It was about making a plan for its *whole life*. Finding parents who could give it a stable, loving home. That was a huge weight.\n\nChoosing Mark and Vanessa\u2026 that wasn't easy. It wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because there's no such thing. It was about finding people who were genuinely good, who were ready to love this kid unconditionally. And realizing that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt taught me that love isn't always about possession. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if that means sacrificing your own happiness. And responsibility isn't just about following rules. It's about making hard choices and owning the consequences.\n\nIt also made me realize that family isn't just about blood. It's about the people who show up for you, who support you, who love you for who you are. My dad, Paul, Vanessa, Mark\u2026 they all became my family in different ways.\n\nSo, yeah. It was a really messed up situation, but it made me grow up. It made me see the world in a different way. And it taught me a lot about love and responsibility that I never would have learned otherwise. It wasn't what I expected, but\u2026it was good. It was real. And it made me who I am today.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a movie scene, you know? It wasn't all swelling music and instant connection. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? I was terrified. Like, full-blown panic attack terrified. I'd been so focused on the practical stuff \u2013 finding the right parents, making sure everything was okay \u2013 that I hadn't really let myself *think* about actually seeing him.\n\nAnd then there he was. Little Leo. All scrunched up and red and\u2026tiny. And I just\u2026froze. It was like, all the air got sucked out of the room.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Oh my god. I *made* that.\" It was a really weird feeling. Like, I was responsible for this little human being. And I wasn't ready. I wasn't even close to ready.\n\nBut then he opened his eyes. And they were these big, dark, serious eyes. And he just\u2026looked at me. And something shifted.\n\nIt wasn't instant love, like in the movies. It was more like\u2026a wave of protectiveness. And sadness. And a weird kind of pride.\n\nI held him for a few minutes, and it was\u2026okay. It was really okay. It didn't fix everything, and it didn't make the decision any easier, but it made it feel\u2026right.\n\nI knew I was doing the right thing, giving him a life with Paul and Vanessa. But it still hurt. A lot.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And the most beautiful. And the most terrifying. All at the same time.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I felt. It wasn't perfect. It wasn't easy. But it was real. And it was\u2026Leo.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026still a tough one to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like I was trying to be cruel or anything. It was just\u2026complicated.\n\nSee, Paulie and I, we were\u2026comfortable. We were friends. Good friends. And the thought of messing that up, of changing things, was terrifying. I was sixteen! I hadn't even figured out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. Adding a baby into the mix felt\u2026impossible.\n\nAnd I was scared he'd freak out. Not because he's a bad guy, he's a really sweet guy. But he's\u2026Paulie. He's a little clueless sometimes. And I didn't want him to feel obligated or pressured or\u2026pity me. I wanted him to want to be involved because *he* wanted to, not because I told him I was pregnant.\n\nI know it sounds selfish. And maybe it was. But I needed time to process everything myself. I needed to figure out what I was going to do before I dragged him into it. I needed to be strong, for both of us.\n\nIt wasn't about not trusting him. It was about protecting our friendship. And protecting myself. I was a mess, okay? I was trying to be brave, and sometimes being brave means keeping things to yourself, even when it's the hardest thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't the right thing to do, I know that now. But at the time, it felt like the only thing I *could* do. It was a stupid, teenage decision. But it was my decision. And I had to live with it.\n\nAnd thankfully, he was a really good guy. And he forgave me. Eventually. It took a while. But he did. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, okay, this is still a sore spot, honestly. It's not like I *wanted* him to find out, you know? It just\u2026happened. And it was totally Mark's fault.\n\nSo, here's the story. I was trying to be all cool and collected and not freak out about everything. And I definitely wasn't planning on telling Paulie right away. I needed to figure things out myself first.\n\nBut Mark, being Mark, is a total blabbermouth. He and I were at a Sonic, getting slushies, and I was venting to him about everything. About the pregnancy test, about the adoption plan, about how scared I was. I thought I was being discreet, but apparently not.\n\nHe started asking a lot of questions, and I was trying to be vague, but he's surprisingly perceptive when he wants to be. And then, he saw Paulie walking by. And he just\u2026blurted it out. Right there, in the middle of Sonic.\n\nIt was mortifying. Absolutely mortifying. Paulie just stood there, looking completely stunned. And I wanted to disappear into the floor.\n\nMark apologized later, of course. He said he didn't mean to, that he just got carried away. But honestly, I was furious. It wasn't his secret to tell.\n\nBut, looking back, I guess it was kind of a good thing he did. It forced Paulie and me to actually talk about it. And it turned out he was a lot more supportive than I expected.\n\nStill, I wish Mark had kept his mouth shut. Seriously. That guy. He's a good friend, but he can be so clueless sometimes.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. It was a really awkward moment. And it all could have been avoided if Mark hadn't decided to be a human megaphone.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was a single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, adoption is the answer!\" It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of freaking out, and a lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026terrified. I was sixteen. I was a junior. I had plans. Not, like, *grand* plans, but I was gonna go to college, maybe be a journalist, definitely not be a mom. It just wasn't in the cards.\n\nAnd then there was the whole\u2026life thing. Like, a whole other person depending on me. That's a lot of responsibility. I wasn't ready for that. I don't think anyone is at sixteen.\n\nBut abortion\u2026that didn't feel right either. Not for me. I don't judge anyone who chooses that, but it just wasn't something I could do.\n\nSo, adoption kind of\u2026emerged as the only option that felt okay. It felt like the most selfless thing to do. Like, this baby deserved parents who were ready and able to give it everything it needed. And I wasn't. Not then.\n\nVanessa and Paul were amazing. They didn't pressure me either way. They just listened and helped me think through everything. And they helped me find a really great couple, Mark and Vanessa Loring, who were just\u2026perfect. They were so excited and so loving.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye was\u2026brutal. But knowing that the baby was going to a good home, with people who wanted it and could provide for it\u2026that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a choice. A really hard choice. And choosing what was best for everyone involved. Especially the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. A lot. It forced me to think about things I never would have thought about before. And it made me realize that I'm stronger than I thought I was.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026complicated. But I don't regret it. I really don't.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on Bleeker. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't like, a dramatic screaming match or anything. It was worse. It was just\u2026quiet. He just kinda looked at me, and then looked away. And said he wasn't ready. That he didn't think he could be a dad.\n\nAnd it wasn't even about *me*, you know? It wasn't like he didn't want to be with *me*. He just didn't want to be a dad. Which, okay, fair enough. It's a big responsibility. But still. It stung.\n\nIt felt like\u2026everything I'd been doing, all the planning, all the worrying, it was all for nothing. Like I'd built this whole future in my head, and he just\u2026didn't want to be a part of it.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to be understanding. I told myself it was the right decision, that the baby deserved a dad who actually *wanted* to be a dad. But inside, I was just\u2026crushed.\n\nIt made me question everything. Like, was I doing the right thing giving the baby up for adoption? Was I being selfish? Was I ruining everyone's lives?\n\nIt was a really messy time. And honestly, it took me a long time to get over it. But I knew I had to focus on what was best for the baby. And that meant letting Bleeker make his own decision.\n\nIt sucked. It really, really sucked. But you know what? I'm a pretty resilient person. I figured it out. And so will the baby. And so did I. Eventually.", "Ugh. Okay. That. That was\u2026a lot.\n\nSeeing Vanessa with the baby\u2026it was like someone punched me in the gut, but also warmed my insides at the same time. It was weirdly beautiful, and also incredibly painful. Like, a really specific kind of ache.\n\nShe looked\u2026a mess. Seriously. Hair all over the place, mismatched socks, a coffee stain on her shirt. Her house looked like a bomb went off. But she was *glowing*. Like, genuinely, ridiculously happy. And the baby\u2026the baby was perfect. All tiny and squishy and smelling like\u2026baby.\n\nAnd it hit me, you know? Like a ton of bricks. This was it. This was what I wanted for the baby. A real family. A stable home. Someone who was completely, utterly obsessed with it. And Vanessa, despite the chaos, was *that* person.\n\nIt wasn't what I pictured, not even close. I thought I'd be\u2026I don't know, more involved. More\u2026needed. But watching her fumble with the diaper, and sing off-key lullabies, and just look at the baby with that goofy, lovesick expression\u2026it was right. It was *so* right.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. Like, a really important piece. But it also felt like\u2026relief. Like I'd done the right thing. Like I'd given the baby the best possible start.\n\nI just stood there for a minute, trying not to cry. And Vanessa, she noticed me, and she smiled. A real, genuine smile. And she said, \"She's perfect, isn't she?\"\n\nAnd I just nodded. Because she was. And Vanessa deserved her. And I deserved\u2026to move on.\n\nIt was messy. It was complicated. It was everything I expected and nothing like it at the same time. But it was okay. It was\u2026good. Even if it hurt like hell.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me actually *think* about all that. It's still\u2026a thing. But fine, I'll bite.\n\nThat song\u2026 \u201cAnyone Else But You\u201d by The Moldy Peaches\u2026 it's kinda the whole story, isn't it? It's embarrassing to admit, but it totally sums up everything with Bleeker.\n\nSee, everyone thought we were this cute, quirky couple. And we *were*, sometimes. But it was also\u2026complicated. He was sweet, and funny, and he liked me for who I was, which was a big deal. But he was also\u2026safe. Too safe.\n\nThat song is about wanting someone, needing someone, but also being terrified of actually letting yourself *have* them. It's about being scared of getting hurt, of messing things up. And that was me, totally.\n\nI was so focused on the baby, and doing the right thing, and being responsible, that I didn't really let myself fall for Bleeker. I liked him, I cared about him, but I was always holding back. I was always thinking about what *should* be, instead of what *was*.\n\nThe lyrics, \"Anyone else but you, would be my dream come true,\" it's not that I didn't like him. It's that I was scared of the whole thing. Scared of commitment, scared of being a mom, scared of ruining everything. I wanted someone who wouldn't challenge me, someone who wouldn't make me feel things too deeply. Which is, like, a terrible thing to admit.\n\nIt's a really sad song, when you actually listen to it. And it's a really sad story, when you actually think about it. We were good together, in a way. But we weren't\u2026right. Not for the long haul.\n\nSo yeah, that song. It's the soundtrack to a really messy, confusing, and ultimately heartbreaking chapter of my life. And I still can't listen to it without cringing a little. But it's also\u2026honest. And sometimes, honesty is all you've got.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know why everyone's kinda tiptoeing around the whole baby shower thing? It's not exactly a mystery. It's because, like, the whole situation is\u2026complicated.\n\nI'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm not exactly planning a future of diaper changes and PTA meetings. I'm planning on finishing high school and maybe going to college. So, people are understandably weirded out by the idea of celebrating something that feels\u2026premature.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm *excited* about a baby shower. I mean, it's nice that people want to be supportive, but it feels kinda\u2026wrong. Like they're celebrating something that's not entirely joyful. It's a bittersweet thing, you know? I'm giving a baby a good life, but it's not the life *I* planned.\n\nPlus, my parents are\u2026well, they're my parents. They're trying to be supportive, but they're also kinda freaked out. And Paul and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting the baby, they're awesome, but they're also navigating this whole thing. It's a lot for everyone.\n\nSo, yeah, people are unsure. They don't want to offend me, or make things worse. They're trying to be sensitive. It's just\u2026awkward. And honestly, I kinda get it. It's not exactly a typical situation.\n\nI just wish everyone would stop walking on eggshells and just\u2026talk to me. But I guess that's too much to ask. People always have to make things complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, Bren. Seriously. It's not like I was, like, having a secret life or something. It's just\u2026Mark was nice. And he had good taste in music. And movies. Okay? It's not a crime to appreciate a good soundtrack.\n\nBut I get why she's all bent out of shape. I guess. It's just\u2026she's so *intense* about everything. Like, everything has to be perfectly planned and controlled. And I'm not exactly known for my planning skills.\n\nI think she thinks I was being\u2026naive. Like, I didn't realize Mark was trying to, you know, *get* with me. Which, honestly, I wasn't really thinking about. I was just happy someone was sharing their stuff with me. I wasn't looking for a boyfriend or anything. I had bigger things to worry about, like, you know, a baby.\n\nAnd I guess she feels like I didn't tell her about it. Which is true. I didn't. Because I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't like I was sneaking around or anything. I just didn't want to have a whole conversation about it.\n\nShe's just\u2026protective. She wants to make sure I'm okay. And she thinks Mark was taking advantage of me. Which, maybe he was. I don't know. I just wanted to watch a movie and listen to some music. Is that so wrong?\n\nIt's just\u2026she always has to be right. And she always has to be in control. And it's exhausting. But I know she means well. She's a good person. She just\u2026overthinks things. A lot.\n\nI probably should have told her. I get that. But honestly, it felt like a small thing. And now it's a whole thing. Ugh. Teenagers.", "Ugh. Okay, so you wanna talk about my mom? Fine. It's not like she's wrong, exactly. It's just\u2026 frustrating.\n\nShe thinks I'm, like, hopelessly naive about relationships. And honestly? She's probably right. I mean, I've had a couple of crushes, a disastrous make-out session with Paulie Bleeker, and that's pretty much it. My experience with romance is limited to movies and overhearing conversations at the diner.\n\nBut it's not just that. She and my dad\u2026 well, their marriage wasn't exactly a fairytale. It was more like a long, slow unraveling. She's seen a lot of stuff, and she's convinced that all relationships are doomed to end in disappointment.\n\nShe thinks I'm all sunshine and rainbows, and that I don't understand the hard work and compromise that goes into making a marriage work. She thinks I'm just looking for a storybook ending, and that I'm going to be crushed when reality hits.\n\nAnd maybe she's right about that too. But it's still annoying. I'm not a baby. I can think for myself. I can make my own decisions. And I'm trying to be responsible about this whole situation, even if it's, you know, a little bit complicated.\n\nShe just\u2026 she wants to protect me. She doesn't want me to make the same mistakes she did. But sometimes, it feels like she's not trusting me to figure things out on my own.\n\nIt's complicated. Family is complicated. And my mom is\u2026 well, she's my mom. She means well. She just has a really pessimistic view of love. And she thinks I'm too young and clueless to understand. Which, okay, maybe I am. A little. But I'm trying.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not exactly easy to talk about. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't like I didn't love the baby, okay? It wasn't that. It was just\u2026 I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nPaul, he was great, but he wasn't exactly equipped to be a dad either. We were kids ourselves. And Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were just\u2026 so ready. They *wanted* a baby so badly. They had a beautiful home, a stable life, and they were just\u2026 good people.\n\nIt felt like the right thing to do. Like, giving the baby the best possible life. A life I couldn't give it at that time. It wasn't about me not wanting to be a mom someday, it was about knowing I wasn't ready *now*.\n\nIt was scary, though. Really scary. Letting go. But Vanessa kept saying it wasn't about giving up the baby, it was about making a plan. And she was right. It was about doing what was best for everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn't a happy decision, exactly. It was a hard decision. But it was the right one. And I still think about the baby sometimes. I hope they're happy. I hope they know they were loved.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story with a neat little ending. It just\u2026 is. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's still a little raw, if you don't mind. So maybe we can talk about something else now? Like, I don't know\u2026 the merits of different types of tater tots?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like a multiple choice test, you know? It was messy and complicated and not at all what I expected. But yeah, I learned a lot. Mostly about myself.\n\nI think the biggest thing I learned is that I'm stronger than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I mean, I always thought I was pretty independent and capable, but dealing with all of *this*\u2026it forced me to grow up, fast. I had to make some really hard decisions, and I had to stand by them, even when everyone else was trying to tell me what to do.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to ask for help. I'm usually pretty good at handling things on my own, but I couldn't do this alone. Paul and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They really stepped up. And even my dad, surprisingly. I learned that letting people in doesn't make you weak, it makes you human.\n\nAnd I learned that I'm not as cynical as I pretend to be. I mean, I still have my sarcastic moments, obviously. But underneath all that, I actually care a lot. About the baby, about finding a good home for him, about doing the right thing.\n\nI also realized I don't have all the answers. And that's okay. It's okay to be confused and scared and unsure of yourself. It's part of being a person.\n\nIt was\u2026a weird experience. But it made me think about what I want out of life, and what kind of person I want to be. And I think I'm starting to figure that out. It's still a work in progress, obviously. But I'm getting there.\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, really. It was about me. And figuring out who I am, and what I'm capable of. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a good question. It's not like a straight line, you know? It was messy. And weird. And surprisingly\u2026nice.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026awkward. Like, *super* awkward. They were this perfect, put-together couple, and I was\u2026me. A sarcastic, pop-tart-loving teenager who accidentally got pregnant. They were trying to be nice, but it felt\u2026distant. Like I was a project or something. A case study.\n\nVanessa, she was the one who was trying the hardest, I think. She was always asking me how I was feeling, offering to take me to doctor's appointments, stuff like that. But it felt\u2026forced. Like she was checking boxes. I didn't want pity, you know? I just wanted to be treated like a person.\n\nMark was quieter. He was nice enough, but he mostly just stayed in the background. I think he was just\u2026overwhelmed. It was a lot for them, too, I guess. They hadn't planned on adopting, and suddenly they were thrown into this whole thing.\n\nBut then, things started to shift. We started just\u2026talking. Not about the baby all the time, but about normal stuff. Vanessa found out I liked The Moldy Peaches and started listening to them. Mark and I bonded over our mutual love of old movies.\n\nIt wasn't like they became my parents, or anything. That wasn't the point. But they became\u2026friends. People I could trust. People who genuinely cared about me and the baby.\n\nI think the biggest change happened when they started to see me as a person with my own thoughts and feelings, and not just as someone who was giving them a baby. And I started to see them as people with their own struggles and hopes and dreams.\n\nBy the end of the process, it was\u2026bittersweet. I was happy for them, and I knew they were going to be amazing parents. But it was also hard to let go. They had become a part of my life, and I was going to miss them.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect relationship, but it was real. And it taught me a lot about love, and family, and what it means to make a difficult decision. It was\u2026good. Even if it was also really, really hard.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not something I think about *all* the time, but it definitely pops up now and then.\n\nRegrets? Not exactly. I mean, I don't regret giving the baby up. That was the right decision. For me, for the baby, for Mark and Vanessa. They were amazing, and they gave that kid a life I couldn't have given her.\n\nBut\u2026there are things I wish I'd handled differently. Maybe I was a little too flippant about it sometimes. I used humor as a shield, you know? And maybe I didn't let myself feel all the things I needed to feel. I was so focused on being strong and independent that I kinda shut down.\n\nI wish I'd talked to my dad more. He was\u2026surprisingly supportive, but I still kept a lot from him. And I wish I hadn't been so hard on myself. It was a really complicated situation, and I was just a kid.\n\nI guess what I regret is not letting myself be vulnerable enough. Not letting people in. But that's just\u2026me, I guess. I'm working on it.\n\nIt's not about wishing I'd made different choices, it's about wishing I'd been a little kinder to myself during the whole thing. It was a lot to handle, and I did the best I could. And that's gotta be enough, right?\n\nIt's just\u2026it's complicated. It always will be. But I'm okay. I really am. And she's okay too. And that's all that matters.", "(Sighs, looks down at my hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's not like it just *goes away*, you know?\n\nIt was\u2026hard. Really hard. Everyone kept telling me I was doing the right thing, and I knew I was, logically. But knowing something and *feeling* something are two totally different things. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. And it was.\n\nFor a long time, I felt\u2026empty. Like there was this huge hole inside me. I was angry, and sad, and confused. I kept replaying everything in my head, wondering if I'd made the right decision.\n\nBut then\u2026 I started getting letters. And pictures. From Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted her. They were so happy. And she\u2026 she was thriving. They gave her a life I just couldn't have provided. A stable home, a loving family, opportunities\u2026\n\nSeeing that\u2026 it started to heal things. It didn't erase the pain, but it gave it a purpose. It made me realize that giving her up wasn't about *losing* a baby, it was about *giving* her a life.\n\nIt definitely changed me. It made me grow up, faster than I was ready to. It taught me about responsibility, and sacrifice, and the importance of putting someone else's needs before your own.\n\nI think it also made me more\u2026 empathetic. I'm more aware of other people's struggles, and more willing to help.\n\nIt's still something I think about, all the time. I wonder what she's like, what she's doing. But I know she's loved, and that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it never will be. But it shaped me into the person I am today. And honestly? I think I'm a better person because of it. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what really matters in life.\n\n(Looks away again, a small, sad smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt's complicated. It just\u2026 is.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. If I could talk to another girl who found out she was pregnant and was thinking about adoption\u2026 I guess I'd say a few things.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. Like, *really* scared. It's okay to cry, to freak out, to not know what to do. It's a huge thing to deal with, and you're allowed to feel all the feelings. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nSecond: you are not alone. Even if it feels like it, there are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a friend, a counselor. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nAnd third, and this is the important one: it's okay to choose what's right for *you*. Seriously. There's a lot of pressure, a lot of opinions, a lot of people telling you what you should do. But at the end of the day, it's your body, your life, and your decision.\n\nAdoption isn't giving up. It's choosing a life for your baby that you might not be able to provide right now. It's a selfless act, and it takes a lot of courage. And it doesn't mean you don't love your baby. It means you love them enough to want what's best for them.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. There will be days when you're sad, and days when you question your decision. But you're strong. You're stronger than you think. And you'll get through it.\n\nAnd don't let anyone make you feel ashamed. You're not a bad person. You're just a young woman making a difficult decision. And you deserve to be treated with respect and compassion.\n\nJust\u2026take it one day at a time. And remember that you're not alone. There are people who care about you, and they'll be there for you every step of the way.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to be a little bit messy. Life is messy. Just try to be kind to yourself. That's all you can do.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole blog thing? It wasn't exactly my idea, you know? It was Paul. He was all, \"You should document this! It'll be good for you to process your feelings!\" Like I needed *another* way to process my feelings. As if having a baby wasn't enough.\n\nBut honestly? It started as a way to keep my parents updated without having to, like, actually *talk* to them on the phone all the time. They were\u2026a lot. And I figured a blog was a good way to control the narrative, you know? I could say what I wanted, when I wanted.\n\nThen, it kind of took on a life of its own. People started reading it. And then they started commenting. And then\u2026they started relating. \n\nIt was weird. I mean, I wasn't trying to be some inspirational figure or anything. I was just a teenager who accidentally got pregnant and was trying to figure things out. But a lot of people were going through similar stuff, or had gone through it, and they found my blog helpful.\n\nSo I kept writing. It was a good outlet. It helped me sort through my thoughts and feelings. And it was kind of nice to know that I wasn't alone.\n\nPlus, it gave me something to do besides obsess over whether or not Mark was going to be a good dad. Which, let me tell you, was a *constant* source of anxiety.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it started. A way to avoid phone calls, control the story, and maybe, just maybe, connect with other people who were going through something similar. It wasn't planned, but it ended up being a pretty good thing.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Honestly? The biggest lesson? It wasn't about babies, or adoption, or even Paul Bleeker, as dreamy as he is. It was about\u2026owning your stuff. Like, *really* owning it.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was kinda drifting, you know? Just trying to be cool and sarcastic and avoid anything that felt too real. I didn't really think about the future, or what I wanted out of life. I just\u2026was.\n\nBut getting pregnant forced me to grow up, like, immediately. I had to make a decision, and it wasn't a fun decision. And then I had to deal with the consequences of that decision. And I had to be honest with myself about what I wanted, even if it wasn't what everyone else expected.\n\nIt wasn't about being brave, or selfless, or any of that stuff. It was about taking responsibility for my own life. And realizing that I was the only one who could make the right choices for me.\n\nIt sounds kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. I learned that it's okay to be scared, and it's okay to ask for help, but ultimately, you gotta own your own story. And that's a pretty powerful thing.\n\nAnd also, that Mark was a total weirdo. But that's a separate lesson.", "Ugh. Okay. So, you're in that situation. That's\u2026a lot. It totally sucks, honestly. It's not how anyone plans things, you know?\n\nFirst of all, breathe. Just\u2026breathe. It feels like the world is ending, but it's not. It's just\u2026changed. And that's okay. It's okay to be scared, and confused, and overwhelmed. It's okay to cry. A lot.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you what you *should* do. This is your decision, and yours alone. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they can offer advice, but ultimately, it's up to you.\n\nThink about what *you* want. Really think about it. What's best for you? What's best for the baby? There are options, okay? You can parent, you can adopt, you can\u2026well, you know. And all of them are valid.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Planned Parenthood is a good place to start, too. They can give you information and resources.\n\nAnd don't feel guilty, no matter what you decide. It's a hard decision, and there's no right or wrong answer. Just do what feels right for *you*.\n\nIt's gonna be okay. It really is. It's gonna be hard, and messy, and complicated, but you're stronger than you think. You'll get through this. And you'll figure things out.\n\nJust\u2026don't do it alone. And don't let anyone pressure you. This is your life, and you deserve to make the best decision for yourself.\n\nSeriously. Breathe. You got this. Even if you don't feel like it right now.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all mushy. Thinking about a kid\u2026it's weird. But if I *had* to picture it, if I was actually going through with this whole thing, my ideal vision isn't about them being a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that. Honestly, that sounds exhausting.\n\nIt's about them being\u2026happy. Truly, genuinely happy. And not the fake, Instagram-filtered kind of happy. The real kind.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, something that makes them excited to get out of bed in the morning. It doesn't matter what it is \u2013 pottery, coding, competitive bird watching, I don't care. As long as it makes *them* tick.\n\nI want them to be kind. Like, genuinely kind to people, even the ones who are annoying or different. The world needs more kindness, seriously.\n\nI want them to be independent. To think for themselves and not just follow the crowd. To question everything and not be afraid to stand up for what they believe in.\n\nI want them to be resilient. Life is gonna throw curveballs, and I want them to be able to handle it. To pick themselves up when they fall down and keep going.\n\nAnd I want them to know that it's okay to be weird. It's okay to be different. It's okay to not fit in. In fact, it's kinda awesome.\n\nI don't want to push them into anything. I just want to support them and give them the tools they need to be the best version of themselves.\n\nBasically, I want them to be a good person who's happy and fulfilled. Is that too much to ask? Probably. But hey, a girl can dream, right?\n\nAnd honestly, if they just avoid getting pregnant in high school, I'll consider it a win. Just sayin'.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People think we're just\u2026dumb. Like, we didn't think this through, or we're just irresponsible kids playing house. That's the biggest one, and it's *so* annoying.\n\nIt's not like I woke up one morning and was like, \"Oh, cool, a baby! That seems easy!\" It's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes things happen. And just because I'm young doesn't mean I'm incapable of making a difficult decision, or of being a good mom.\n\nPeople assume we're all just ruining our lives, and that's just not true. It changes things, yeah. It's hard. But it doesn't mean my life is *over*. It means my life is different. And I'm still a person, with dreams and goals and stuff. \n\nWe're not all tragic cases. We're just\u2026people. Trying to figure things out. And we deserve a little bit of respect, you know? And maybe a little less judgment. It's not helpful. It just makes things harder.\n\nSo yeah, that's it. We're not dumb. We're just\u2026young moms. And we're doing the best we can.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? It wasn't like, a simple decision. It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? I was scared. Really scared. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. I wasn't exactly equipped to be a mom.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted that kid to have a good life. A stable life. A life with parents who were ready for it, who could give it everything it needed. I knew I couldn't provide that, not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nMark\u2026Mark was a good guy, but he was just as lost as I was. We were kids pretending to be adults. It wouldn't have been fair to the baby, or to us.\n\nVanessa and Mark \u2013 they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They could give that baby a life I just couldn't. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best *for* the baby. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, and it still hurts sometimes. But I know I made the right choice.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. And that's all that really matters.\n\nDon't make me talk about this anymore. It's\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, okay, that was\u2026a process. Seriously. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment or anything. It was a lot of awkward meetings and trying to figure out who wasn't completely insane.\n\nAt first, I was kinda just going through the motions, you know? Like, looking at the profiles, trying to find someone who seemed\u2026normal. But then you meet people, and normal goes out the window pretty quick. There was that one couple who wanted to name the baby \"Magnolia Sunshine,\" and I was like, *hard pass*.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they were different. They weren't perfect, nobody is. Vanessa was a little\u2026intense, maybe. Really into organic food and decorating. But she was also really warm and kind. And Mark was just\u2026chill. He didn't try to be anything he wasn't.\n\nWhat really got me was when I went to their house. It wasn't fancy or anything, but it felt\u2026comfortable. Like a real home. And they had a dog, a little beagle named Buster, and Buster immediately liked me. That's a good sign, right? Animals can sense things.\n\nWe talked for a long time, and they didn't try to pressure me or tell me what to do. They just listened. They asked me what *I* wanted, what *I* thought was best for the baby. And they seemed genuinely excited about the idea of being parents, but also realistic about how hard it would be.\n\nI also got a good vibe from them when I saw how they interacted with each other. They were goofy and affectionate and they clearly loved each other. And that's what I wanted for the baby \u2013 a loving and stable home.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because there's no such thing. It was about finding people who were good people, who would love the baby unconditionally, and who would give it a good life. And Vanessa and Mark, they just\u2026felt right.\n\nIt was still a really hard decision, don't get me wrong. But in the end, I knew I was making the right choice. For me, and for the baby.", "Ugh, music? It was\u2026everything. Seriously. It was my lifeline, my escape, my way of figuring out who I was when everything else felt totally messed up.\n\nI wasn't, like, a band geek or anything. I didn't play an instrument. I just *listened*. A lot. And it wasn't just about liking songs, it was about finding the ones that *got* it. You know? The ones that understood how you felt when you were, like, completely overwhelmed and confused and trying to navigate the whole awkwardness of being a teenager.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches were huge. They were just\u2026real. Kimya Dawson's songs were like she was reading my diary. Super depressing, but also kinda comforting. And they weren't trying to be all polished and perfect, which I appreciated.\n\nI also listened to a lot of indie stuff. Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins, Bright Eyes\u2026all that angsty, introspective stuff. It just fit the mood.\n\nAnd then there was the soundtrack to everything. Like, when I was feeling particularly cynical, I'd listen to The Clash. When I was trying to be cool, I'd listen to whatever everyone else was listening to, even if I didn't really like it.\n\nMusic was just\u2026there. It was the soundtrack to my life, and it helped me get through a lot. Especially when things got, you know, complicated. It was a way to feel less alone, even when I was completely surrounded by people.\n\nIt was a way to process everything, I guess. And honestly, it still is. I don't know what I'd do without music. It's just\u2026important. Okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, alright? It wasn't like everyone was throwing confetti and saying, \"Congratulations!\" More like side-eye and whispers. Maple Creek isn't exactly known for its progressive thinking.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignored it. Or pretended to. I mean, what else was I gonna do? Cry about it? That wouldn't have solved anything. I'm not really one for wallowing, even though I look like I am sometimes.\n\nI leaned *hard* on my friends, Leah and Renee. They were amazing. They didn't treat me like some freak show. They just\u2026 were there. They helped me with school, they came to doctor's appointments, they just generally kept me from losing my mind.\n\nMy dad was\u2026 complicated. He was quiet at first, but he came around. He's a good guy, even if he doesn't always know how to express it. And my stepmom, Bren, she was a lifesaver. She actually *helped* me pick out baby names. Can you believe it?\n\nI think a big part of coping was just being\u2026 me. I didn't try to hide or apologize for being pregnant. I just kept being sarcastic and awkward and obsessed with records. I figured if people were gonna judge me, they were gonna judge me anyway. I wasn't gonna give them the satisfaction of seeing me fall apart.\n\nAnd honestly, I think a lot of the stigma came from people just not understanding. They had this idea of what a pregnant teenager was supposed to be like, and I didn't fit that mold. I wasn't a tragic case. I was just\u2026 a kid who made a mistake.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself and about the people around me. And I realized that sometimes, the people you least expect are the ones who will support you the most.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I coped. Mostly by being stubborn and surrounding myself with good people. And a lot of records. Always a lot of records.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's complicated.\n\nRight after Paul\u2026after the baby was born, it was\u2026weird. Like, obviously. I mean, I\u2019d been planning this for months, right? I knew it was the right thing to do. I *wanted* it to be the right thing to do. But holding her\u2026she was so tiny. And perfect. And suddenly all the logical reasons I had for choosing adoption felt\u2026smaller.\n\nThere was this moment, holding her, where I almost\u2026changed my mind. Just completely flipped. But then I remembered everything. My life. School. My future. And the fact that Mark and Vanessa were *so* ready. They were so excited. They could give her a life I just\u2026couldn\u2019t.\n\nGiving her to them was\u2026the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. I cried. A lot. And I kept looking at them, making sure they were okay, making sure *she* was okay.\n\nBut then\u2026I saw how happy they were. And I saw how much they loved her. And that\u2026that made it a little bit easier. It didn\u2019t erase the sadness, but it made it\u2026worth it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I just walked away and forgot about her. I stayed in touch. Mark and Vanessa were really good about that. They sent pictures, told me about her milestones. It was\u2026good. It was a different kind of relationship than being a mom, but it was still important.\n\nI still think about her sometimes. Wonder what she\u2019s like. If she knows. If she\u2019s happy.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t perfect. But it was the right thing to do. For her. And for me. And I wouldn\u2019t trade it. Even though it still kinda hurts sometimes.\n\nIt made me grow up, you know? It made me realize that sometimes, the hardest choices are the best ones. And that love comes in all different forms.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack. I don't really like talking about it, but you asked. And it's important to be honest about it, I guess.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You want me to relive that? Fine. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, okay? It was\u2026a lot.\n\nPhysically, it was just\u2026weird. My body was doing things it wasn't supposed to be doing. Morning sickness was a joke. It was all-day sickness. And not just throwing up, it was the nausea, the exhaustion, the weird cravings. Pickles and ice cream? Yeah, I did that. Don't judge.\n\nAnd then there was the bloating. Oh, the bloating. I looked like I was smuggling a basketball under my sweater. It was not a cute look. And my feet swelled up. I had to get new shoes. It was a disaster.\n\nBut the emotional stuff was way harder. I mean, I was sixteen. I had plans. I was supposed to be applying to colleges, figuring out my life, not\u2026growing a human. It was terrifying. I was angry, and sad, and confused, and just\u2026overwhelmed.\n\nI cried a lot. Like, a *lot*. And I pushed people away. I didn't want anyone to see me like that. I didn't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\n\nPaul was\u2026good. He was awkward, but he was there. And my mom, surprisingly, was really supportive. She didn't freak out like I thought she would. She just\u2026listened. And she made me hot chocolate. A lot of hot chocolate.\n\nI also started seeing a therapist. That helped. It gave me a safe space to talk about my feelings without being judged.\n\nHonestly, it was just about taking things one day at a time. And realizing that it was okay to not be okay. It was okay to be scared. It was okay to be confused. It was okay to just\u2026feel.\n\nAnd eventually, I started to feel\u2026something else. A little bit of hope. A little bit of excitement. A little bit of\u2026love.\n\nIt was still scary, but it wasn't as overwhelming. I realized that I could do this. I could be a mom. Even if I wasn't ready.\n\nIt was a mess, okay? But I got through it. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the pickles and ice cream.", "(Sighs, looks down at my hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's still\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, before all this happened, I didn't really *think* about reproductive rights, you know? It was just\u2026 something that was there. Like, people had opinions, and there were protests, but it didn't really affect my life. I was too busy making mixtapes and avoiding gym class.\n\nBut then\u2026 finding out I was pregnant? That changed everything. It wasn't just some abstract political issue anymore. It was *my* life. *My* body. *My* future.\n\nAnd honestly? It was terrifying. I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I had plans. I wanted to finish school, maybe go to college. I wasn't equipped to be a mom.\n\nChoosing to have an abortion wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. There was a lot of guilt, a lot of sadness, a lot of just\u2026 feeling lost. People had opinions, and a lot of them weren't very nice. Even people who meant well.\n\nBut ultimately, I knew it was the right decision for me. It allowed me to keep control of my life. It allowed me to pursue my dreams.\n\nAnd that's why I feel so strongly about reproductive rights. It's not about being \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It's about letting people make their own decisions about their own bodies. It's about respecting their autonomy. It's about giving them the freedom to choose what's best for *them*.\n\nBecause no one else can make that decision for you. No politician, no religious leader, no family member. It has to be your choice.\n\nI think everyone deserves that right. Everyone. And I'll fight for it, because I know what it's like to have that right taken away, or even just threatened. It's a scary feeling.\n\n(Looks away again, a little uncomfortable)\n\nIt's\u2026 yeah. It's a lot. But it's important.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about the fear part? Yeah, there was a *lot* of that. Like, a constant, low-level hum of panic. It wasn't like in the movies, where you suddenly feel all maternal and glowing. It was more like\u2026 \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m going to ruin a human life.\u201d\n\nHonestly? I didn't really \"overcome\" it. I just\u2026learned to live with it. And a lot of it was just admitting to myself that I *was* terrified. Like, really terrified. It's okay to be scared. It doesn't mean you're not capable.\n\nPaul helped, obviously. He was a good guy. And my dad, surprisingly. He wasn't thrilled at first, but he came around. Having people who believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself, made a huge difference.\n\nBut mostly, it was just taking things one day at a time. I couldn't think about the next 18 years, or even the next month. I just focused on what I needed to do *right now*. Like, making sure I had enough money for diapers, or going to doctor's appointments.\n\nAnd I realized that being a parent isn't about being perfect. It's about showing up. It's about trying your best, even when you're failing miserably. And it's about loving that little person with everything you have.\n\nI also had to let go of the life I thought I was going to have. I had plans, you know? College, maybe moving to another state. But those plans changed. And that was hard. But I realized that sometimes, the best things in life are the things you never planned for.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And that even when you're scared out of your mind, you can still do amazing things.\n\nSo, yeah. I didn't overcome my fears. I just learned to carry them with me. And I learned that sometimes, fear can be a good thing. It can motivate you to be a better person. And a better parent.", "Ugh, okay, so this is\u2026a big question. And it's not like I sat down and made a *plan*, you know? It wasn't like, \"Okay, I'm pregnant, time to find a nice couple.\" It was way messier than that.\n\nHonestly? It started with being realistic. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was barely figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have the money, the stability, the\u2026anything.\n\nBut it wasn't just about me being unprepared. It was about wanting the best for the baby. And I realized that the best thing I could do wasn't to keep it. It was to give it to someone who *could* give it everything it needed. A stable home, financial security, a loving family\u2026things I just couldn't provide at that point in my life.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. They were so excited, so ready. They wanted a kid so badly. And they weren't looking for a perfect baby, or a perfect situation. They just wanted to love and care for a child.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. There were a lot of tears, a lot of second-guessing. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up the baby. It was about giving the baby a *better* life. And that's what mattered most.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story. But it was my story. And I'm okay with it. I really am.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026weird sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a lot. You're asking about the messy parts, huh? Fine. Let's talk about it. It's not like I haven't thought about it enough already.\n\nWith Leah\u2026 Leah is my rock. Seriously. She's the only one who really *gets* me, you know? She doesn't judge, she just\u2026is. We've been through everything together, and even when I'm being a total disaster, she's still there. It's a really comfortable friendship. We can be completely honest with each other, even when it's awkward. Sometimes *especially* when it's awkward. It's not a super dramatic friendship, it's just\u2026solid. Like a really good pair of jeans. It's the kind of friendship I know will last, even when life gets crazy. And it *is* getting crazy.\n\nPaulie\u2026 Paulie is\u2026complicated. He's a good guy, I guess. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a goofball. But he's also\u2026young. And immature. And we're both kinda messes, honestly. It's not a traditional relationship, and it never was supposed to be. We were just\u2026there for each other. And then things happened. I don't think either of us was really ready for this, but here we are. \n\nIt's weird, because I don't necessarily *love* him, not in the way people talk about in movies. But I care about him. A lot. And I want him to be a good dad. And I think he wants to be. It's just\u2026we have a lot to figure out. We're learning as we go, which is terrifying. It's not always easy, and we definitely have our fights. But underneath it all, there's a respect and a connection. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, both relationships are important to me, but in totally different ways. Leah is my constant, my safe space. Paulie is\u2026the unknown. And I'm trying to navigate that, one awkward conversation at a time. It's a lot. It's really a lot. And sometimes I just want to curl up with a tater tot and pretend none of it is happening. But that's not really an option, is it?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't a *decision*, exactly. It wasn't like I sat down and thought, \"Oh, this would be a fun life choice.\" It just\u2026happened.\n\nPaul Bleeker and I\u2026we weren't exactly careful. We were kids. We were figuring things out. And honestly, we were both kinda awkward and didn't really talk about stuff like that. It was a mistake, yeah, but it wasn't a mistake I regretted immediately.\n\nIt was scary, obviously. Really scary. I was a junior in high school! I had plans. I was gonna go to college, maybe move to New York, become a journalist or something. And suddenly, all that felt\u2026different.\n\nBut it wasn't all bad. I mean, finding out I was pregnant forced me to grow up, I guess. It made me think about things I hadn't thought about before. And it made me realize I wasn't as selfish as I thought I was.\n\nI knew I couldn't raise a kid myself. I wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable. I wasn't emotionally ready. So, I started looking into adoption. And that felt\u2026right. It felt like the best thing for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *giving* a baby a life. A good life. With parents who were ready and able to provide for it.\n\nSo, it wasn't a decision I made lightly. It was a complicated, messy, and kinda heartbreaking decision. But it was the right one. For me, and for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me who I am today. It forced me to figure out what I wanted out of life, and to be a little bit braver and a little bit more responsible. It wasn't the path I expected, but it was my path. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was still hard. But I got through it. And I learned a lot along the way.", "(Sighs, looks off to the side for a beat, then back at you)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I still think about. A lot.\n\nRegret isn't exactly the right word. It wasn't like, \"Oh man, I *wish* I hadn't done that.\" It was more\u2026 complicated. There were definitely moments, especially after I gave him up, where it felt like a piece of me was missing. Like a really big, important piece.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. Seeing Mark and Vanessa with him, knowing he had a good life\u2026 it was good. It *had* to be good. But it also felt\u2026 weird. Like I was watching a movie of a life that could have been mine.\n\nAnd there were times I wondered what it would have been like to keep him. To raise him. To be a mom. But then I'd remember why I made the decision I did. I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I had my own life to figure out. And I knew, deep down, that Mark and Vanessa could give him everything I couldn't.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret the decision itself. I regret the sadness. I regret the feeling of loss. But I don't regret giving him the best possible life.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it made me grow up a lot, really fast. It taught me a lot about myself, about love, and about what it means to be a good person.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's not something you just *get over*, you know? It's always going to be a part of me. And that's okay.\n\n\n\n(Looks down, fiddles with her hands)\n\nIt was the right thing to do. I know it was. But that doesn't mean it didn't hurt.", "Ugh, okay, so that was\u2026a whole thing. Honestly, it wasn't easy. It was mostly just a lot of caffeine, a lot of strategically placed hoodies, and a whole lot of pretending everything was totally normal when it was, like, the opposite of normal.\n\nFirst of all, Paul, bless his heart, was a huge help. He drove me to school, helped me with homework, and generally just tried to make things less stressful. And my mom, even though she was\u2026a lot\u2026was surprisingly supportive. She helped me pick out maternity clothes that didn't scream \"teen mom\" and made sure I was eating enough.\n\nBut mostly, it was just about prioritizing. I had to get my act together. I couldn't just blow off school, you know? I still wanted to graduate. I still wanted to have options.\n\nI talked to my guidance counselor, Mr. Spencer, and he was really cool about it. He helped me adjust my schedule so I could take some classes online and have more flexibility. I also had to skip a few things \u2013 cheerleading, obviously. And I definitely wasn't going to any more parties.\n\nIt was exhausting. I was constantly tired, and I had morning sickness for, like, forever. And dealing with all the stares and whispers was\u2026not fun. But I just kept my head down and focused on getting my work done.\n\nI also had to deal with Leah, who was being\u2026Leah. She meant well, but she was constantly trying to \"help\" and making things more complicated. But she came around eventually.\n\nHonestly, it was just about taking it one day at a time. And reminding myself that I wasn't alone. And that even though my life was totally different than I expected, it could still be good.\n\nIt wasn't glamorous, okay? It was messy and stressful and weird. But I did it. I graduated. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like I was, like, *pro-life* or anything. That wasn't really the point. It was more\u2026I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I know that sounds kinda vague, but it's true.\n\nI mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone what I wanted for the rest of my life. And suddenly I was supposed to make this huge decision about\u2026another life? It was terrifying.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. And the baby hadn't done anything wrong. It didn't ask to be there. And I just\u2026I couldn't shake the feeling that it deserved a chance.\n\nI talked to my mom, and she was really supportive. She didn't push me either way. She just said, \"It's your decision, Juno. Whatever you choose, I'll be there for you.\"\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026different. They weren't what I expected. They were actually really cool. And they were so excited about the idea of having a baby. They wanted it so badly.\n\nAnd I realized that I could give them that. I could give this baby a loving home with parents who were ready for it. And that felt\u2026right.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing. For me, for the baby, and for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt wasn't about what I *believed* in, it was about what I *felt*. And I felt like this was the best option. It was the most\u2026responsible thing to do.\n\nSo yeah. That's why. It wasn't a simple decision, and it's still something I think about. But I don't regret it. Not one bit.", "Ugh, okay, that's a\u2026big question. And honestly, a really important one. Look, I've been through a lot with this whole baby thing, right? And it's made me think. A lot.\n\nAnd yeah, absolutely. A kid can totally thrive under non-traditional arrangements. Like, who decided what a \"traditional\" family even *is* anyway? It's kinda arbitrary, if you ask me.\n\nIt's not about the gender of the parents or whether there's one or two of them. It's about love, and stability, and being there for the kid. It's about providing a safe and supportive environment where they can grow up to be a decent human being.\n\nI mean, look at Van and Mark. They're\u2026not what people expect, you know? But they're amazing. They're kind, and patient, and they genuinely want what's best for the baby. And that's what matters.\n\nA single parent can be just as good as two parents, if they have a strong support system and are committed to raising their child. And same-sex couples? Seriously, what's the difference? Love is love. And a kid needs love. Period.\n\nIt's not about fitting into some pre-defined mold. It's about creating a family that works for *that* kid. And sometimes, that means breaking the rules a little bit.\n\nHonestly, I think kids are pretty resilient. They adapt. And they're pretty good at figuring out who loves them, regardless of what anyone else thinks.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely believe a child can thrive under non-traditional arrangements. It's not about the *structure* of the family, it's about the *quality* of the love and support. And that's what really counts.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me think about this. It's not exactly a fun topic. But fine, you asked.\n\nI guess\u2026 my biggest flaw is probably that I build walls. Like, really high, really sturdy walls. I'm good at being sarcastic and deflecting and making jokes, and that's fine, it's a coping mechanism. But sometimes I use it to keep people *out*. \n\nI'm scared of getting hurt, okay? It's easier to be cynical and detached than to actually let someone in and risk getting my heart broken. I push people away before they can push me away, you know? It's a dumb move, I know, but it's hard to stop.\n\nAnd I'm really good at pretending I don't care about things, even when I totally do. Like, with Paulie Bleeker. I acted all cool and indifferent for way too long. It was a total mess.\n\nIt's just\u2026 vulnerability is terrifying. It feels like handing someone a weapon. And I've already got enough going on without adding more drama to the mix.\n\nSo yeah, I guess my biggest weakness is being afraid to be\u2026 real. It's something I'm working on, though. Slowly. It's a process. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay. Mark. That's\u2026a complicated question. It's not like he was a *bad* guy, you know? Just\u2026not the right guy. And honestly, the whole thing was just\u2026a mess.\n\nBefore Mark, I had this really naive idea of what relationships were supposed to be. Like, this grand romantic gesture, a perfect connection, a happily ever after. You know, the stuff they show in movies. And then reality hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nHe was sweet, and he was genuinely excited about the baby, which was good. But he was also\u2026kind of clueless. He wanted the idea of a family, but he didn't really *get* what that meant. He wanted me to be this perfect mom and wife, and he didn't really see me as a person with my own dreams and goals.\n\nIt made me realize that a relationship isn't just about finding someone who loves you. It's about finding someone who respects you, who supports you, who challenges you to be a better version of yourself. It's about finding someone who sees you for who you are, flaws and all.\n\nAnd it also made me realize that you can't force a connection. You can't make someone feel something they don't feel. And trying to do so just ends up hurting everyone involved.\n\nIt was a really hard lesson to learn, especially with a baby on the way. But it was a necessary one. It made me stronger, and it made me more clear about what I wanted in a partner.\n\nIt wasn't about finding someone to \"save\" me, or to complete me. It was about finding someone to share my life with, someone who would be my equal, my partner, my friend.\n\nPaul\u2026he gets that. He doesn't try to change me. He just\u2026accepts me. And that's a pretty amazing feeling.\n\nSo yeah, Mark changed my perspective on relationships. It taught me that love isn't always enough. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is walk away. Even if it's scary. Especially if it's scary.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not easy to answer. But if someone's in a situation like I was\u2026look, first of all, it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to feel like your whole life is falling apart. Because it kinda is.\n\nBut it's also okay to be strong. And it's okay to make a decision that's right for *you*, even if it's not what everyone else thinks you should do.\n\nHere's what I learned, and what I'd tell someone now:\n\n*   **Don't let anyone pressure you.** This is *your* life, *your* body, *your* decision. Your parents, your friends, the baby's dad\u2026they can offer advice, but ultimately, it's up to you.\n*   **Talk to someone you trust.** Someone who will listen without judgment. A friend, a family member, a counselor\u2026anyone who will just be there for you.\n*   **Consider all your options.** Adoption isn't the only answer, but it's a valid one. Think about what's best for you and for the baby.\n*   **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available to help you, no matter what you decide.\n*   **It's okay to grieve.** Even if you know you're making the right decision, it's still going to be hard. Allow yourself to feel your feelings.\n*   **You are not alone.** A lot of people have been in similar situations. You're not the first, and you won't be the last.\n*   **You are stronger than you think.** You're going to get through this. It's going to be tough, but you're going to get through it.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to be a mess. It's okay to not have all the answers. Just take things one day at a time. And remember that you deserve to be happy.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. But you can do it. I did. And so can you.\n\nJust\u2026breathe. And don't let anyone tell you what to do. You got this.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a straight line, you know? It's been more like a really twisty, bumpy road with a few detours and a couple of flat tires.\n\nWhen I first found out I was pregnant, he was\u2026not thrilled. To say the least. He was all, \"What are you *thinking*?\" and \"This is going to ruin your life!\" which, okay, fair enough. But it still stung. He's always been kinda\u2026practical. And I'm, well, not.\n\nFor a while, it was just a lot of awkward silences and him trying to \"fix\" things. Like he thought he could just *solve* a pregnancy. It was annoying. I needed him to just\u2026be there, you know? Not try to make it all go away.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to change. He started coming to the doctor's appointments with me, and he actually *listened* to what I was saying. He started asking questions, not just giving advice. And he started to realize that I wasn't just some irresponsible kid. I was actually trying to do the right thing, even if it wasn't the easiest thing.\n\nHe was a huge help with Mark, too. He wasn't all gushy and stuff, but he was reliable. He helped with the practical stuff \u2013 getting the nursery ready, driving me to appointments, just being a steady presence.\n\nNow? We still bicker. We still disagree about things. He still thinks I should have gone to college right away. But there's a\u2026respect there now. A real connection. He's not just my dad, he's\u2026a friend, in a weird way.\n\nI think he finally realized that I'm my own person, and that I'm going to make my own choices, even if he doesn't always agree with them. And I realized that he loves me, even if he doesn't always know how to show it.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, honestly. But it's gotten a lot better. A lot. And I'm grateful for that. He's a good guy, my dad. Just\u2026a little bit clueless sometimes. But who isn't?", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the essays. Like, it was some magical gift or something. It wasn't. It was mostly just\u2026avoidance. And a lot of staring out the window.\n\nHonestly, I didn't *try* to develop my writing skills. It just kinda happened. I was failing history, okay? Mr. Hetrick was convinced I was actively trying to sabotage my education. So I had to write an essay to pass. And then another one. And another one.\n\nI think the key was that I didn't care about sounding smart or using big words. I just wanted to write something that was\u2026true. To how I actually thought. And I have a lot of thoughts. Mostly sarcastic ones.\n\nI also read a lot. Not like, assigned reading. I read comic books, magazines, anything I could get my hands on. And I paid attention to how people talked. Real people, not characters in books.\n\nAnd I watched a lot of movies. Especially John Hughes movies. He was a master of capturing teenage angst.\n\nI think the biggest thing, though, was just\u2026being honest. I didn't try to be someone I wasn't. I just wrote about what I knew, which was mostly awkwardness and feeling out of place.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I developed my writing skills. By being a procrastinator and a cynic. It's not a glamorous story, but it worked.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a good distraction from everything else that was going on. Which, at the time, was a lot.\n\n\n\nDon't overthink it. Just write what you feel. And don't be afraid to be weird. Weird is good.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big one. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? There was a lot of side-eye, a lot of whispers, and a lot of people just assuming the worst. It sucked.\n\nHonestly, the worst part wasn't even the people I didn't know. It was the people I *did* know. Like, some of my classmates were just\u2026awful. And even some adults were pretty judgmental. It felt like everyone was just waiting for me to fall apart.\n\nI dealt with it by\u2026 well, by being me. Which, admittedly, is a little sarcastic and defensive. I just kinda shut down a lot of the negativity. I didn't really *try* to change anyone's mind. I figured if they were gonna judge me, they were gonna judge me anyway.\n\nBut I also had a really good support system. My dad, surprisingly, was amazing. He was quiet about it at first, but he was always there for me. And Paul, of course. He was\u2026 a good egg. And my best friend, Leah, she was a lifesaver. She didn't treat me any differently, and she just let me be me.\n\nI also just kinda focused on the fact that I was doing what *I* wanted to do. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom, but I also knew I wanted to give this baby a good life. And that was what mattered.\n\nI think a lot of it was just\u2026 ignoring the noise. And realizing that other people's opinions didn't define me. I was still Juno MacGuff, even if I was also a pregnant teenager. And that was okay.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and there were definitely days when I wanted to just disappear. But I got through it. And honestly, it made me stronger. It forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted. And that's something I'm grateful for, even if it was a really messy process.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I dealt with it. A little bit of sarcasm, a lot of support, and a whole lot of just trying to be myself.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. One I don't usually let myself dwell on, honestly. But yeah. Sometimes.\n\nLook, being brutally honest is kinda my default setting. It's easier than pretending to care about stuff I don't, or saying what people want to hear. It's just\u2026me. And it usually works out fine. Mostly.\n\nBut there have been times, you know? Times when I said something I shouldn't have, or when my honesty hurt someone's feelings. And then I feel like a jerk. A really big jerk.\n\nLike with my dad. I wasn't exactly sunshine and rainbows with him, even before\u2026everything. I was always quick to point out his flaws, and I probably didn't show him enough appreciation. And now\u2026well, now it's too late. And I wonder if things would have been different if I'd just swallowed my pride a few times.\n\nOr with Paul. I was pretty blunt with him, even when he was being\u2026Paul. And sometimes I think he just needed someone to be nice to him, you know? Instead of constantly making fun of his earnestness.\n\nSo yeah, I regret it sometimes. I regret not being able to just\u2026filter myself. But then I think, if I wasn't me, if I wasn't honest, I wouldn't have met the people I met, and things wouldn't have happened the way they did. And maybe that's okay.\n\nIt's a trade-off, I guess. I'm a work in progress. Still figuring things out. And maybe learning to be a little bit kinder, even if it means biting my tongue sometimes. But don't expect me to change completely. I'm still gonna call things like I see them. It's just\u2026I'm trying to be a little more mindful about *how* I say them.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big one. Seriously. It's like, everyone has an opinion about everything, and when you're doing something that's not exactly\u2026conventional, the opinions come *fast*.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie, it sucks. People judging you, making assumptions, thinking they know what's best for you. Especially when you're dealing with something like\u2026well, you know. A baby. And deciding what to do with it.\n\nHere's what I've figured out, though. It's not about ignoring everyone else. That's impossible. It's about figuring out whose opinions actually *matter*. And that's usually just a really small circle of people. Like, Paul, my dad, maybe a couple of friends. People who actually know me, and who aren't just projecting their own stuff onto me.\n\nThe rest? You gotta let it roll off your back. Easier said than done, I know. But you can't live your life trying to please everyone. You'll just end up miserable.\n\nI think the key is to know what *you* want. And to be honest with yourself about it. Even if it's messy, and complicated, and doesn't fit into anyone else's idea of what you should be doing.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to be a little bit weird. Seriously. The people who are worth keeping around are the ones who appreciate your weirdness.\n\nIt's also okay to change your mind. I mean, I've changed my mind about a lot of things. That doesn't mean I'm flaky or indecisive. It just means I'm figuring things out as I go.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes you just gotta tell people to mind their own business. Politely, of course. But firmly.\n\nIt's a process. It's not like you wake up one day and suddenly you're immune to other people's judgments. But the more you practice being true to yourself, the easier it gets. And the more you realize that their opinions don't define you. *You* define you.\n\nAnd that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a school assignment. But okay, if I *have* to think about it\u2026\n\nI guess the biggest thing for me is **honesty**. Not like, \"never tell a lie\" honesty, because sometimes a little white lie is necessary to spare someone's feelings. But being honest with *myself*, you know? Knowing what I really want and not pretending to be someone I'm not.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I don't want to rely on anyone else to make me happy or take care of me. I want to be able to figure things out on my own, even if it's messy.\n\nAnd **authenticity**. Being real. Not trying to fit in or be cool or impress anyone. Just being me, flaws and all. It's exhausting trying to be someone you're not.\n\nI also think **kindness** is important. Even to people who are annoying or mean. You never know what someone else is going through.\n\nAnd finally, **loyalty**. To the people I care about. I'm not a lot of people's friend, but the ones I have, I'm fiercely loyal to.\n\nI guess those are the things that matter to me. They're not always easy to live by, but they're what I try to aim for. It's kinda weird to actually *say* them out loud, though. It feels\u2026vulnerable.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said all this, okay? It's embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breath. The biggest challenge? Honestly, it wasn't the morning sickness, or the weird cravings, or even the whole \"my body is changing\" thing. It was\u2026people.\n\nLike, everyone had an opinion. Everyone. My parents, Paul, even random people at the grocery store. They all thought they knew what was best for me and the baby. And it was exhausting.\n\nMy dad was all about \"doing the right thing,\" which meant giving the baby up for adoption, which I already *knew* I wanted to do, but he kept acting like I needed convincing. And my mom was just\u2026sad. All the time. Which made me feel guilty, even though I wasn't doing anything wrong.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He was great, mostly. But he kept trying to be the hero, like he could fix everything. And I just wanted him to listen. To understand that this was *my* decision.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot of pressure. A lot of people telling me what to do, what to feel, what to think. And I just wanted to be left alone to figure things out for myself.\n\nSo yeah, the biggest challenge wasn't the pregnancy itself. It was navigating all the expectations and opinions and trying to stay true to what *I* wanted. It was realizing that I had to be my own advocate, even when it was hard.\n\nIt was\u2026a mess. But I got through it. And honestly, it made me a lot stronger.", "(Sighs, fiddles with a strand of hair)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like I walked around before thinking life was all sunshine and rainbows, you know? I was pretty cynical. Still am, kinda. But\u2026yeah. It's changed things. A lot.\n\nBefore, everything was about *me*. Getting through high school, figuring out what I wanted to do, avoiding awkward conversations\u2026it was all self-focused. And that's not a bad thing, I guess, when you're sixteen. But then you have this little person who completely depends on you, and suddenly your whole world shifts.\n\nIt's not about being selfless, exactly. It's more like\u2026your priorities just rearrange themselves. Suddenly, worrying about what people think of your shoes seems really stupid. You start thinking about things like, \"Will she be safe?\" and \"Will she be happy?\" and \"Am I doing enough?\"\n\nIt's terrifying, honestly. Like, the weight of responsibility is\u2026intense. But it's also\u2026amazing. Seeing her learn and grow and just be\u2026herself\u2026it's the best thing ever.\n\nI used to think I had to have everything figured out. Career, relationships, the whole deal. Now I realize it's okay to not know. It's okay to just be present and enjoy the moment. Because moments are all you really have.\n\nAnd it's made me appreciate the people in my life more. Paul, my parents, even Mark\u2026they're all so important. I wouldn't have been able to do this without them.\n\nIt's still hard, you know? Balancing everything. But it's a good hard. It's a hard that makes you feel\u2026alive.\n\nSo, yeah. Being a mom\u2026it's changed everything. It's made me a better person, I think. Or at least, I hope it has. It's definitely made me a lot less sarcastic. Okay, maybe not *less* sarcastic. But\u2026more selectively sarcastic.\n\n\n\n(Looks down, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a whole new world. And it's pretty great.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. Yeah, I know that guy. He's a real jerk. He shows up at the *worst* times, usually when you're already kinda freaking out about something else.\n\nOkay, so here's the thing. It doesn't really *go* away, you know? It's always gonna be lurking somewhere in the back of your head. But you can learn to\u2026manage it.\n\nFirst of all, I try to remember that everyone feels like a total fraud sometimes. Even people who seem super confident. It's just that they're better at hiding it.\n\nThen, I try to talk myself down. Like, I'll say, \"Okay, Juno, you're being ridiculous. You've handled worse things than this.\" And sometimes, I'll actually believe it.\n\nAnd honestly? Talking to someone helps. Like, really talking. Not just venting, but actually being honest about how you're feeling. Paul was good for that. And Bleeker, even if he's kinda clueless sometimes.\n\nBut the biggest thing is to just\u2026do something. Anything. Distract yourself. Watch a movie. Listen to music. Go for a walk. Just get your mind off of it. Because the more you dwell on it, the worse it gets.\n\nAnd you gotta remember that it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to not have all the answers. Nobody does.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026when you're trying to parallel park. You're gonna mess up a few times. But you just keep trying until you get it right. And even if you don't get it right, it's not the end of the world.\n\nSo yeah. Self-doubt sucks. But you can get through it. Just remember to be kind to yourself. And maybe listen to some The Moldy Peaches. That usually helps.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. But seriously? It's\u2026a lot more important than I let on. I try to act all independent and sarcastic and like I don't need anyone, but that's mostly just a defense mechanism.\n\nBefore all this baby stuff happened, I was pretty much a lone wolf. I hung out with Paul, but even that was kinda\u2026casual. I didn't really *need* anyone. Or at least, I didn't think I did.\n\nBut then I got pregnant, and suddenly everything changed. I couldn't just pretend everything was fine anymore. I needed help. I needed someone to talk to. And I needed someone to just\u2026be there.\n\nAnd that's where Leah and my dad came in. And even, surprisingly, Vanessa. They didn't judge me. They didn't try to tell me what to do. They just listened and offered support. And that made all the difference.\n\nIt's not about needing someone to fix your problems. It's about having people who will just sit with you in your problems. People who will make you laugh when you want to cry. People who will remind you that you're not alone.\n\nI still value my independence, don't get me wrong. I still need my space. But I've learned that it's okay to lean on people sometimes. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to let people care about you.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are important. Really important. Even for a cynical, sarcastic teenager like me. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? But if I had to pick *one* thing, the most important lesson\u2026 it wasn't about the baby, or even about giving him up. It was about\u2026owning your own stuff.\n\nLike, for a long time, I was just kinda drifting. Trying to be cool, trying to fit in, not really thinking about what *I* wanted. And then suddenly, I was pregnant, and everything was real. And I had to make a decision, a huge decision, and it had to be *my* decision.\n\nIt wasn't about what my parents thought, or what Paul thought, or what anyone else thought. It was about what I could handle, what I thought was best for the baby, and what I needed for my own life.\n\nAnd that was\u2026terrifying. But also kind of liberating.\n\nI realized that I'm the only one who can live my life. And I'm the only one who has to deal with the consequences of my choices. So I might as well make choices that I can live with, choices that feel right to *me*.\n\nIt sounds kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. It's about taking responsibility for your own life, and not letting anyone else tell you what to do. And it's about being brave enough to do what's right, even when it's hard.\n\nSo yeah. Owning your own stuff. That's the big lesson. And it's one I'm still learning, honestly. It's a work in progress. But it's a good lesson to have.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Honestly? I don't know. It's not like I have a five-year plan or anything. That seems\u2026 exhausting.\n\nBut yeah, I do like writing. I mean, I write a lot in my journal. It's a good way to, like, sort through all the stuff in my head. And Mr. Marcus, my English teacher, he says I have a knack for it. Which is nice, I guess.\n\nI don't know if I want to be a *professional* writer, though. That sounds\u2026intense. And competitive. And probably involves a lot of rejection. I'm not sure I'm ready for all that.\n\nI think I just like being able to express myself. To put my thoughts and feelings into words. It's kinda therapeutic, you know?\n\nMaybe I'll just keep writing in my journal. Or maybe I'll write a novel someday. Or maybe I'll just write really sarcastic letters to people who annoy me.\n\nI don't know. I'm still figuring things out. I'm sixteen. I'm allowed to be confused, right?\n\nBut yeah, I think I'm pretty good at it. So maybe. Maybe I will pursue a career in writing. Or maybe I'll just keep it as a hobby. We'll see. Don't hold me to anything.\n\n\n\nIt's not like I'm gonna be the next Jane Austen or anything. But it's something I enjoy. And that's good enough for now.", "Ugh, okay, the name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly stressful process, actually. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was more like a series of compromises and accidental discoveries.\n\nSee, Mark \u2013 the dad \u2013 wanted something really\u2026normal. Like, Michael or something. Which is fine, I guess, but kinda boring. And I wanted something\u2026unique. Something that fit the kid, you know? Something that wasn't gonna get them teased relentlessly in middle school.\n\nWe went through a *lot* of names. Like, a ridiculous amount. We had lists and lists. And everything sounded awful. Everything.\n\nThen, one day, I was flipping through this old record album with my dad \u2013 a really obscure folk singer named Joan Baez \u2013 and I saw her name. And it just\u2026clicked. It sounded strong and kinda cool, but not too weird.\n\nSo, we went with Joan. It's a classic name, but it's not super common anymore. And it's a tribute to my dad, because he loves Joan Baez. It felt like a good compromise.\n\nIt wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment or anything. It was just\u2026the least bad option. Which, honestly, is how a lot of things work in life.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it suits her. She's a little Joan, and she's pretty awesome. Even if she does keep me up all night sometimes.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, winding road with a lot of unexpected potholes.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was good at being sarcastic and pretending I didn't care, but inside\u2026it was a mess. I mean, finding out you're pregnant is already a lot for a sixteen-year-old. And then deciding to give the baby up? That's\u2026heavy.\n\nThere were days I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. I was angry, sad, scared\u2026all at the same time. I kept thinking, \"What if I change my mind?\" or \"What if nobody wants him?\" It was a constant loop of worry.\n\nWhat helped, surprisingly, was Paul and Vanessa. They weren't trying to tell me what to do, or make me feel guilty. They just\u2026listened. And they were honest. They didn't sugarcoat things, but they were also really supportive.\n\nAnd Mark. He was\u2026unexpected. I didn't think I'd connect with him, but he was just\u2026normal. He made me laugh, and he didn't treat me like I was broken or something.\n\nTalking to them, and to my dad, helped me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a failure. It was a brave thing to do. It was about wanting what was best for him, even if it meant I had to make a really hard choice.\n\nIt still hurt, though. A lot. Seeing Vanessa and Mark with the baby\u2026it was bittersweet. I was happy for them, but I also felt a pang of sadness.\n\nI think the biggest thing was allowing myself to feel those feelings. Not trying to bottle them up or pretend they weren't there. And realizing that it was okay to grieve.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it still isn't always easy. But I'm okay. I'm figuring things out. And I know I made the right decision. It doesn't make it less hard, but it makes it\u2026worth it.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. You know? Life is complicated. And sometimes, the hardest choices are the best ones.", "Ugh, okay, music. It's kinda important, you know? Gotta have something to drown out the world. So, it's not all bubblegum pop or anything, okay? I have standards.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches. They're just...real. Like, super honest and kinda weird. Kimya Dawson is a genius.\n\nBut I also listen to a lot of indie stuff. Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins...you know, the sad-girl-with-a-guitar vibe. It just fits my mood, most of the time.\n\nI'm not really into anything too mainstream. Like, I can tolerate some Arcade Fire, but anything too poppy just makes me roll my eyes.\n\nAnd I have a soft spot for oldies. Like, The Velvet Underground. My dad used to listen to them. It reminds me of him.\n\nBasically, if it's authentic and a little bit melancholy, I'm probably into it. I don't need anything upbeat and happy. Life's already complicated enough, you know?\n\nSo yeah, that's my music taste in a nutshell. Don't judge. It's a work in progress. And it definitely reflects my current state of...everything.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. It's...complicated. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. Like, aggressively perfect. Their house was all Pottery Barn and organic everything. It smelled like lavender and responsibility. Which, don't get me wrong, is nice. But it wasn't *me*.\n\nTheir lifestyle was\u2026preppy. They did yoga, they ate quinoa, they had a golden retriever named Comet. Comet was cute, I'll give them that. But it was all so\u2026planned. Everything had a place. Everything was coordinated. It felt like living in a catalog.\n\nMy house is\u2026messy. We eat pizza and watch bad movies. My dad's always tinkering with something in the garage. It's chaotic, but it's *real*.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is what a 'normal' family looks like.\" And it was a little intimidating. I worried if I could fit in. If I could be the daughter they expected.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't like them. They were really nice people. They just\u2026weren't us. It felt like two different worlds colliding.\n\nI think that's why I kept being sarcastic and making jokes. It was a defense mechanism. A way to test them, to see if they could handle the real me. And thankfully, they did. They saw past the snark and the awkwardness and saw\u2026well, I guess they saw something worth adopting.\n\nBut yeah, the house and the lifestyle? It was definitely a culture shock. It was a good shock, ultimately. But a shock nonetheless.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole garage band thing\u2026 that was Paul\u2019s idea, mostly. He\u2019s just\u2026enthusiastic about everything. Like, aggressively enthusiastic. It\u2019s endearing, sometimes. And annoying.\n\nBut it started because he kept trying to impress me with his guitar skills. Which weren\u2019t, like, *amazing*. He could play a few chords, but mostly he just strummed really loudly. And he kept writing these songs about me. Which was\u2026awkward.\n\nSo I was like, \u201cOkay, fine. If you want to play music, let\u2019s actually *do* something with it. Let\u2019s start a band.\u201d I figured it would be a good way to, like, channel his energy and maybe get him to stop writing songs about my internal organs.\n\nAnd then Leah got involved, because she\u2019s a total badass on the bass. And she\u2019s the only one who could actually keep Paul in check. She\u2019s way more musically talented than both of us combined.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t even know how to play an instrument. I just\u2026talked into a microphone. And wrote some lyrics. Mostly about being pregnant and feeling confused. It was therapeutic, I guess.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about becoming famous or anything. It was just about having something to do, and about Paul trying to win me over with his questionable musical abilities. And it was kinda fun, actually. Even though we were terrible. Really terrible.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s how the garage band happened. A combination of teenage hormones, awkwardness, and a desperate attempt to distract Paul from writing love songs about my uterus. It was a whole thing.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. And it's a really important one. If I could talk to another girl going through what I went through\u2026 I'd say a lot of things.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the things. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nSecond: you are not alone. Seriously. Even when it feels like it, you're not. There are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nThird: you have options. And those options are *yours* to decide. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with. Whether you choose to parent, adopt, or\u2026 well, you know\u2026 it's your decision. And it's a valid decision.\n\nFourth: it's okay to be selfish sometimes. You need to take care of yourself too. This is a huge thing to go through, and you need to prioritize your own well-being.\n\nFifth: don't let this define you. You are more than just a pregnant girl. You have dreams and goals and a whole life ahead of you. This is just one chapter in your story.\n\nAnd finally: it's going to be hard. Really hard. But you are stronger than you think. You can get through this. And you deserve to be happy.\n\nIt's not going to be easy, but you're not weak for needing help. And you're not a bad person for making a difficult choice. You're just\u2026 a girl trying to figure things out. And that's okay.\n\nJust\u2026 breathe. And remember that you're not alone. And that things will get better. Eventually.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me think about clothes. It's not my favorite thing. But fine, I'll describe it. It's not, like, fancy or anything.\n\nIt's a faded, dark green t-shirt. It used to be a brighter green, I think, but it's been washed a million times. It's kinda soft now, in a worn-out way. It has a picture on it of a skeleton playing a ukulele. It's really cheesy, but I got it at a flea market and it just\u2026spoke to me.\n\nIt's not too tight, not too loose. Just comfortable. And it hides stains pretty well, which is important. I usually wear it with jeans and Converse. \n\nIt's not a statement piece or anything. It's just\u2026my shirt. It feels like me. And it doesn't make me feel like I'm trying too hard, you know? Which is important.\n\nDon't judge the skeleton with the ukulele. It's ironic. Okay?", "Ugh, okay, that's a heavy question. Aspirations? Goals? It's not like I've got some five-year plan mapped out, you know? I'm kinda just\u2026existing right now. Dealing with things as they come.\n\nBut yeah, if I had to think about it\u2026 I guess I want to be\u2026okay. Just, genuinely okay. Not pretending, not putting on a brave face, just\u2026content.\n\nI don't need to be rich or famous or anything. I just want to find something I'm good at, something that makes me feel like I'm contributing something to the world. Maybe something creative. I like writing, even if it's just sarcastic observations in my head.\n\nI definitely want to be a good mom. To this baby. That's the biggest thing, I think. I want to give it a good life, a stable life, even if I'm not perfect.\n\nAnd I want to figure out who *I* am, you know? Not just \"the pregnant girl\" or \"the girl who's giving the baby up.\" Just\u2026Juno. What does that even mean? I'm still working on that part.\n\nI guess my goal is to just\u2026grow up. Without losing myself in the process. It's kinda scary, but also kinda exciting.\n\nSo yeah, no grand ambitions. Just\u2026trying to figure things out. And hoping for the best. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh. Okay, the pre-adoption counseling. Right. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't *bad*, exactly, but it was definitely\u2026intense. And awkward. Like, super awkward.\n\nIt felt like I was being interviewed for a job, except the job was giving away my baby. Which is a weird thing to have to \"qualify\" for, you know? Like, \"Oh, you seem stable enough to raise a human. Here you go.\"\n\nThey asked a lot of questions. A *lot*. About my life, my plans, my feelings. Which, okay, fair enough. But it felt like they were trying to make sure Mark and Vanessa were perfect, and I was just\u2026the vessel.\n\nI get that they were trying to make sure the baby was going to a good home. And I really appreciated that, honestly. Mark and Vanessa *are* amazing. But it still felt weird to have strangers dissecting my life and making judgments.\n\nAnd the whole thing about \"grief\" and \"loss\"\u2026 yeah, I knew I was going to be sad. But it felt like they were trying to make me feel guilty for wanting a normal life. Like, I was supposed to be devastated and inconsolable. And I was sad, don't get me wrong. But I also wanted to finish high school and go to college and, like, have a future.\n\nIt was helpful, I guess. It made me think about things I hadn't really thought about before. And it helped me feel more confident in my decision. But it was also really emotionally draining.\n\nHonestly, I just wanted it to be over. I just wanted to get through it and move on. It was a necessary evil, I guess. But definitely not my favorite part of the whole process.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a really complicated situation, and sometimes I felt like they were trying to simplify it too much. Like, they wanted me to fit into a neat little box. And I don't really *do* neat little boxes.", "Ugh, that's a good question. It's\u2026complicated. Control is a strong word. It wasn't like I was running the show, you know? I wasn't picking out the perfect family based on their kitchen decor or anything.\n\nBut I did feel like I had a voice. Like, I wasn't just being *told* what was going to happen. Paul and Mark, my dad and stepmom, were really good about letting me be involved. They took me to the meetings with the adoption agency, and they listened to what I wanted.\n\nI got to read the profiles of the potential adoptive parents, and I got to ask questions. I got to choose the family I felt most comfortable with. And that felt\u2026empowering, I guess.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because that doesn't exist. It was about finding people who I thought would be good for the baby. People who would love him and take care of him.\n\nSo, did I have *total* control? No. But I had enough control to feel like I was making a decision that was right for me and for the baby. And that's what mattered. It wasn't just something happening *to* me. I was an active participant.\n\nIt was still scary, though. Giving up a baby is never going to be easy. But knowing that I had a say in who he went to made it a little bit easier. It made me feel like I was doing the best thing I could, even though it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I think about a lot, even now.\n\nIf I could go back in time\u2026 it's not simple. It's not like flipping a switch. There are a million things that would be different. And maybe, if things were different, I would have made a different choice.\n\nBut knowing what I know now\u2026 knowing how happy Mark and Vanessa are, knowing how much they love the baby\u2026 I think I would.\n\nIt wasn't about *not* wanting the baby. It was about knowing I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being a mom. I had dreams, you know? I wanted to go to college, I wanted to write, I wanted to\u2026 just *be* me.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa, they were ready. They were so excited. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't at that time. A stable, loving home.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But seeing how happy everyone is\u2026 it makes me think I did the right thing.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a choice for everyone involved. And I think, ultimately, it was the most selfless thing I could have done.\n\nSo yeah. I think I would make the same decision. It doesn't mean it was easy. It just means I think it was the right thing to do.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's still complicated. But I'm okay with it. I'm learning to be okay with it. And that's all that matters, I guess.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People kept saying, \"Oh, you're so selfless!\" and I was like, \"Yeah, well, try not crying into your pizza for a week.\"\n\nIt was weird. Like, I knew it was the right thing to do. I really did. Paul and Vanessa were amazing, and they were going to give the baby a life I just couldn't. But knowing that didn't make it *easy*.\n\nI think the hardest part was the waiting. Waiting for the baby to be born, waiting for the adoption to be finalized, and then\u2026waiting for it to feel okay. It felt like a huge hole in my life, even though I knew it was a hole that needed to be there.\n\nI talked to my dad a lot. He's pretty good at just\u2026listening. And not judging. He didn't try to fix things, he just let me be sad. And that helped. A lot.\n\nVanessa was really good too. She kept me updated, sent me pictures (which I cried over, obviously), and just\u2026treated me like a person, not just a birth mom. That meant a lot.\n\nI also threw myself into stuff. School, music, hanging out with Leah. Just trying to keep busy and not think about it all the time. Which didn't always work.\n\nHonestly, it took a long time. It wasn't like one day I woke up and everything was fine. It was more like\u2026slowly, gradually, the sadness started to feel less sharp. And I started to feel\u2026peaceful.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what she's like, what her name is, what she's doing. But it's not a painful thing anymore. It's more like\u2026a quiet hope.\n\nI guess what I learned is that it's okay to grieve. It's okay to be sad. And it's okay to need help. It doesn't mean you made the wrong decision. It just means you're human.\n\nAnd, you know, sometimes the hardest things are the things that make you grow up the most. And I definitely grew up a lot during that whole process. It sucked, but\u2026it made me who I am.", "Ugh, yeah. Okay, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's not like it was a *fight*, exactly, but there were definitely\u2026moments.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were great people, really. Super nice. But they had a very specific idea of what they wanted, and sometimes that clashed with what I wanted, or what I thought was best for the baby.\n\nLike, they were really into organic everything. Organic clothes, organic food, organic toys. Which is fine, I guess, but it felt\u2026intense. Like, the baby needed to be perfect, and everything had to be just so. And I was just trying to get through high school and eat a tater tot every now and then.\n\nAnd there was the whole \"name\" thing. They had a list of names, and they were all\u2026really preppy. Like, \"Bartholomew\" and \"Penelope.\" And I was like, \"Um, no. That's not happening.\" I wanted something a little more\u2026normal. We eventually compromised on a name I could live with, but it took a while.\n\nThe biggest thing, though, was just the feeling of\u2026giving up control. It was my baby, but I wasn't going to be raising it. And it was hard to let go of that, even though I knew it was the right thing to do. They wanted to be involved in everything, which was good, but it also felt like they were taking over.\n\nPaul and Vanessa were really good about talking things through, though. And they listened to me. Eventually, we all found a way to work together and make sure the baby was going to have a good life. It just wasn't always easy. It was complicated. But that's life, right? It's rarely simple.\n\n\n\nIt's weird to even talk about it, honestly. It still feels\u2026raw sometimes. But it was worth it. Knowing that the baby was going to be loved and cared for, that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big one. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It was complicated.\n\nLook, Paul was a good guy. Really. Sweet, a little clueless, but genuinely wanted to do the right thing. But he wasn't ready to be a dad. Not even close. And honestly, I wasn't ready to be a mom, either. Not then.\n\nIt wasn't about him being a bad person. It was about what was best for the baby. And what was best for the baby was a stable, loving home with parents who were actually prepared to raise a kid. Mark and Vanessa were that. They were\u2026ready.\n\nIt was my decision, ultimately. And it was hard. Really hard. I felt bad for Paul, and I knew it would hurt him. But I also knew that if he was involved, it would just make things messier and more complicated. It would drag things out and potentially mess up the adoption.\n\nI didn't want the baby to be caught in the middle of our\u2026whatever we were. It wasn't a relationship, really. It was just\u2026a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nSo, yeah, it felt kinda cold, I guess. But it was the most responsible thing to do. It was about putting the baby's needs first. And sometimes, that means making tough choices. Choices that hurt.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. Wondering if I could have handled it differently. But I honestly believe it was the right decision. For everyone involved. Even Paul. Especially the baby.\n\nIt's just\u2026it wasn't easy. And it's not something I'm particularly proud of. But it was what it was. And I had to live with it.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't like a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It started with just being\u2026realistic. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being. Paul was\u2026well, Paul was Paul. Sweet, but not exactly ready to be a dad. And my parents? They were supportive, but I knew they weren't equipped to help me raise a kid either.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want the baby. I did. But I wanted the baby to have a good life. A *stable* life. A life where they were wanted and loved and had everything they needed. And I just\u2026didn't think I could give them that. Not then. Not ever, really.\n\nIt was Mark who kind of opened my eyes to adoption. He and Vanessa were looking for a baby, and they seemed\u2026perfect. They were older, they had a house, they had a plan. They were genuinely excited about the idea of being parents.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. It still kinda stings, if I'm being honest. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For the baby. And for me.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up something I wanted. It was about choosing what was best for everyone involved. And sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It still is. But I don't regret it. I really don't. I just hope I made the right choice.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It was\u2026 complicated. And messy. And really, really hard.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I pretended I was fine. I made a lot of sarcastic jokes. I tried to just\u2026 move on. But it didn't work. It just kinda built up inside me, you know? Like a pressure cooker.\n\nPaul was really good, actually. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just\u2026 listened. And he let me be sad. And angry. And confused. Which was exactly what I needed.\n\nVanessa too. She was amazing. She understood, because she'd been through something similar. She didn't judge me, and she helped me see that giving the baby up wasn't a failure. It was a brave thing to do. A selfless thing.\n\nIt took a long time to process everything. There were a lot of tears. A lot of late nights. A lot of questioning whether I'd made the right decision. But eventually, I realized that I *had*. Mark and Vanessa were amazing people. They were going to give the baby a life I couldn't.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. I wonder what she's like. What her name is. But it doesn't hurt as much anymore. It's more\u2026 bittersweet.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped me was accepting that it was okay to feel all the feelings. It was okay to be sad. It was okay to be scared. It was okay to be angry. And it was okay to be hopeful.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It's still not easy. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that sometimes, the hardest thing to do is also the right thing to do.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's a part of my story now. And I'm okay with that.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I like to dwell on, but I wanted to be honest with you. It was a really tough time, but I got through it. And you can get through tough times too.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a typical \"getting to know you\" situation, you know? It wasn't like I was picking out a new pair of shoes. It was my *baby*.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were good people. Really good people. Like, ridiculously good. They were\u2026perfect. And that was part of the problem, honestly. They had the house with the swing set and the golden retriever and the perfectly coordinated family photos. It was a little intimidating.\n\nAt first, I was super awkward. I mean, I was a teenager giving away my baby. It's not exactly a casual conversation starter. I kept trying to be cool and detached, like, \"Yeah, this is fine, no big deal.\" But inside, I was a mess.\n\nVanessa was really good at making me feel comfortable. She didn't try to be my friend or anything, she just\u2026listened. And she asked a lot of questions, not in a nosy way, but because she genuinely wanted to know me and understand what I was going through.\n\nMark was quieter. He was a little intimidating at first, but he was also really kind. He kept offering me snacks, which was weird, but also kind of sweet.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings. Talking about everything. What they wanted for the baby, what I wanted for the baby, how much contact we'd have after the adoption. It was hard. Really hard.\n\nI was scared they'd judge me, or think I wasn't a good person. But they never did. They were just\u2026supportive. They wanted to make sure I was okay.\n\nOver time, I started to feel more comfortable around them. I realized they weren't trying to replace me, they were just trying to give my baby a good life. And that's all I wanted too.\n\nIt wasn't a traditional family, but it was a family. And it was a good one. I still see them sometimes. And it's\u2026nice. It's still a little weird, but nice.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It was a really complicated relationship, but it was also a really important one. They gave my baby a home, and they gave me a little bit of peace of mind. And I'll always be grateful for that.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And yeah. It totally has. Like, duh. It's not something you just *get over*, you know? It's not like getting a bad haircut or failing a test. It's\u2026life-altering.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was pretty\u2026carefree. I was sarcastic, yeah, but mostly I was just trying to get through high school without being totally weird. I had my friends, my music, my plans for the future. And then\u2026bam. Everything changed.\n\nI had to grow up, like, *fast*. I had to start thinking about things I wasn't ready to think about. Responsibility, and what I wanted for this kid, and what kind of person I wanted to be. It was scary. And it still is, sometimes.\n\nI think it's made me more\u2026aware. Of other people, of the world, of how complicated things can be. I used to be pretty cynical, but now I see things in a different light. I see the good in people more easily, I guess. And I appreciate the people who have been there for me.\n\nIt's also made me realize what I *don't* want. I don't want to be someone who just drifts through life. I want to be someone who makes a difference, even if it's just a small one.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I'm still just a teenager. But I'm not the same teenager I was before. I'm\u2026stronger, I think. And more determined. And maybe a little bit wiser.\n\nIt's been hard, but it's also been\u2026good. In a weird way. It's forced me to confront things about myself that I never would have otherwise. And it's made me realize that I'm capable of more than I thought.\n\nSo yeah. It's changed me. A lot. And I think, ultimately, it's changed me for the better. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "Ugh. Okay, that was\u2026rough. Seriously. It was like, overnight, everyone in Beaverton had an opinion on my life. And none of them were asking for one. It was the worst.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. Just pretend it wasn't happening. But that's impossible when you're walking down the hallway at school and people are staring, or whispering behind their hands. Or when your mom's friend corners her at the grocery store to ask \"How is she *coping*?\"\n\nPaul was really good about it, actually. He just wanted to disappear with me and build a cabin in the woods. Which, honestly, sounded pretty tempting. But I couldn't just hide.\n\nWhat helped the most was\u2026leaning into it, I guess. Not in a \"look at me!\" kind of way, but just\u2026owning it. I stopped trying to be invisible. I started being more sarcastic and blunt with people who were being nosy. Like, if someone asked me a stupid question, I'd just give them a really deadpan stare and say, \"What's it to ya?\"\n\nAnd Leah, my best friend, was amazing. She just told everyone to back off. She's a really good friend. She's scary when she needs to be.\n\nIt still sucked, though. It felt like everyone was judging me, like I'd done something wrong. But I realized that their opinions didn't matter. What mattered was me, and Paul, and the baby.\n\nI also started focusing on things I could control. Like school, and my music, and making plans for the future. It helped me to feel like I wasn't just defined by being pregnant.\n\nIt didn't make the rumors go away completely, but it made them a little easier to deal with. And eventually, people just\u2026got over it. Or at least, they stopped talking about it to my face.\n\nIt was a good lesson, though. People are always gonna talk. You just gotta learn to tune it out and focus on what's important. And sometimes, a little bit of sarcasm can go a long way.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not easy to talk about, honestly. It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I was a kid, having a kid. And that just\u2026didn't feel right.\n\nI wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable. I wasn't emotionally ready. I was still in high school, trying to pass chemistry and avoid the popular girls. I had my own life to figure out, and I knew I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved if I kept it.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything. A stable home, loving parents who were prepared, a good education\u2026 things I just couldn't provide at that point in my life.\n\nAnd honestly? It was scary. Really scary. The thought of being a mom, of being responsible for another person, was overwhelming. I just\u2026 I wasn't strong enough. Not yet.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were the kind of people who would give the baby everything I couldn't. And knowing that she was going to a good home, that she was going to be loved and cared for\u2026 that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right one. For me, and for her. It wasn't giving up on her. It was giving her a better life. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. Okay? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's messy and sad and hopeful all at the same time. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. And a hard one. It wasn't, like, a monster under the bed kind of fear. It was\u2026more complicated than that.\n\nI think my biggest fear wasn't that the baby wouldn't be loved. Mark and Vanessa seemed really great, you know? It was that *I* wouldn't be able to do it. That I wouldn't be strong enough to actually\u2026give the baby up.\n\nLike, I knew it was the right thing to do. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. But still\u2026the thought of actually handing over this little person, this tiny human I was growing inside me\u2026it was terrifying.\n\nI kept picturing myself just running away with the baby, and us living in a van down by the river or something. Which is ridiculous, obviously. I'm not exactly equipped for van life.\n\nBut it wasn't about wanting to *keep* the baby, exactly. It was about being a good person. About doing the right thing, even when it was the hardest thing. And I was scared I'd be too selfish, too weak, to follow through.\n\nI was also scared that I'd regret it forever. That I'd spend the rest of my life wondering \"what if?\"\n\nIt was a lot. And I didn't really talk about it with anyone, because it felt\u2026wrong. Like admitting I wasn't completely sure about something. But yeah. That was my biggest fear. Being a failure at being selfless. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to explain.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I get *all* the time. It's kinda embarrassing, honestly. It wasn't some deep, meaningful thing, okay? It was\u2026impulsive. And a little bit silly.\n\nPaul, he was\u2026well, he was Paul. Kind of a blank slate. And I needed a name for the father in the ad, right? Something that didn't scream \"teen mom\" or \"total disaster.\"\n\nI was flipping through a magazine, and there was an ad for Bleeker Street Records in New York. And I just\u2026liked the sound of it. It sounded kinda cool, kinda artsy. And it didn't immediately make me think of, like, a creepy old man.\n\nSo I just wrote it down. It was totally random. I didn't even know if it was a real name. Turns out, it's a street in New York. Go figure.\n\nIt's not like I was planning on naming the baby Bleeker or anything. It was just a placeholder name for the ad. But it stuck. And everyone kept asking me about it.\n\nHonestly, it's a pretty dumb story. But that's the truth. I just needed a name, and Bleeker sounded good at the time. Don't overthink it. It's not a metaphor for anything. It's just a name.\n\nAnd Paul? He didn't really care. He was just happy to be involved. Which, honestly, was kinda sweet.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole punk thing? It wasn't like a conscious decision, you know? It just\u2026fit. Everything else felt so fake and polished and *trying* too hard. And punk was just\u2026raw.\n\nI think it started with just being annoyed. Annoyed with everything. Annoyed with people trying to tell me what to do, what to think, what to wear. Annoyed with the whole perfect-teenager image everyone was pushing. It felt suffocating.\n\nAnd then I heard bands like The Distillers, Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney\u2026and it was like, \u201cOh. People feel this way too.\u201d It was angry and loud and honest. It didn\u2019t try to be pretty. It didn\u2019t try to be popular. It just *was*.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the music, either. It was the whole culture. The DIY ethic, the anti-establishment attitude, the idea that you could create something yourself without needing anyone\u2019s permission. That really resonated with me.\n\nI liked that it was messy and imperfect. It wasn\u2019t about being cool, it was about being real. And it was about questioning everything. Which, let\u2019s be honest, I was already pretty good at.\n\nPlus, the clothes were comfortable. And you didn\u2019t have to worry about matching. Which, as someone who\u2019s generally pretty low-maintenance, was a huge plus.\n\nIt just felt like a place where I could be myself, without having to apologize for it. It was a little bit of rebellion, a little bit of anger, and a whole lot of honesty. And honestly, that\u2019s a pretty good combination.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s what drew me to it. It wasn\u2019t about the music, or the clothes, or the attitude. It was about finding a place where I felt like I belonged. Even if that place was a little bit loud and chaotic.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not something I usually talk about, honestly. But you asked.\n\nIt messed me up, okay? Seeing my parents just\u2026not work. Like, they weren't *fighting* all the time, which is what I think people expect. It was more like they just\u2026drifted apart. Like two ships passing in the night. And it made me super cynical about the whole relationship thing.\n\nI think I built up a lot of walls. I didn't want to get too close to anyone, because I was afraid they'd just\u2026leave. Or change. Or realize I wasn't worth sticking around for. It's stupid, I know. But that's how it felt.\n\nAnd it definitely made me wary of commitment. Like, why bother getting serious with someone when it all just ends in disappointment anyway? That's probably why I was so\u2026flaky with guys before Paul. I just didn't want to invest too much emotionally.\n\nBut then, you know, Paul happened. And he was different. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just\u2026accepted me for who I was. And that was really scary, but also really good.\n\nIt made me realize that just because my parents' relationship didn't work doesn't mean all relationships are doomed. It just means that you have to find someone who's willing to put in the effort, and who you're willing to put in the effort for.\n\nIt still affects me, though. I still have moments where I freak out and worry that things are going to fall apart. But I'm learning to trust Paul, and to trust myself.\n\nIt's a process, you know? It's not like you just get over something like that overnight. But I'm getting there. And I think, ultimately, it's made me a stronger person. Even if it's a really messy, complicated kind of strong.\n\nSo yeah. That's\u2026that's how it impacted me. It's not a fun topic, but it's the truth.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all\u2026reflective. It's kinda embarrassing. But alright, if you *have* to know.\n\nI think what makes my story\u2026different\u2026isn't the pregnancy itself, honestly. Plenty of girls get pregnant. It's just\u2026how I handled it. I didn't freak out and run away, or try to pretend it didn't happen. I just\u2026figured it out.\n\nI think a lot of people expected me to fall apart, to be all dramatic and sad. But I'm not really built for drama. I'm more of a sarcastic observer. So I just approached it like a problem to be solved.\n\nAnd I didn't want to be a mom. Not then, anyway. I had plans. I wanted to go to college, and write, and just\u2026figure out who I was. And I knew I couldn't do that with a baby.\n\nSo I chose adoption. And that wasn't easy. It meant admitting I couldn't do it all, and trusting someone else to give my baby a good life.\n\nBut I think what makes it special is that I didn't let anyone tell me what to do. My parents, Paulie, even Mark\u2026they all had opinions. But I made my own decisions. And I owned them.\n\nAnd I found some really amazing people along the way. Paulie and Vanessa, they were\u2026unexpectedly awesome. They helped me see things in a different light.\n\nSo yeah, it's a messy story. It's complicated. But it's *my* story. And I think that's what makes it special. It's about a girl who figured things out on her own terms, and found her own way to be okay.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, it helped someone else feel a little less alone. That would be pretty cool.\n\nUgh, I'm getting all mushy now. Let's talk about something else. Like, I don't know\u2026music. Or tater tots. Anything but feelings.", "Ugh, okay, good friends. That's\u2026important. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, actually. It's not like I had a ton of experience with it before, you know? But I've learned a few things.\n\nFirst of all, someone who doesn't judge. Like, seriously. Everyone's got stuff going on, and you need someone who's just gonna listen without, like, immediately jumping to conclusions or giving you a lecture.\n\nAnd honesty. Not, like, brutally honest to the point of being mean, but someone who's gonna tell you the truth, even when it's hard. You need someone who's gonna call you out on your BS.\n\nHumor is a big one. Someone who can make you laugh, even when you feel like crying. Life's too short to be serious all the time.\n\nAnd someone who's just\u2026there. You don't have to talk every day, or even every week. But knowing they've got your back, that they'll be there if you need them, that's huge.\n\nAlso, someone who doesn't try to fix everything. Sometimes you just need someone to sit with you in the mess, you know? Not try to solve all your problems.\n\nAnd finally, someone who's okay with you being weird. Because let's be real, everyone's a little weird. And you need friends who embrace that.\n\nBasically, someone who's real. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves, and who accepts you for who you are, flaws and all. That's a good friend. And they're hard to find. But when you find one, you gotta hold onto them.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like it's been all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith my parents\u2026it was rough at first. My dad just kinda shut down. He didn't say much, just looked\u2026disappointed. Which, okay, fair enough. It wasn't exactly what he pictured for me. But it hurt. My mom, she tried to be supportive, but she was also kinda freaking out. Lots of \"Are you sure?\" and \"What are you going to do?\" It took a while for them to come around, to actually see that I was serious about this and that I could handle it. Now, they're\u2026okay. They're helping, which is good. But it's still weird.\n\nPaul\u2026well, Paul's been amazing. Seriously. He could have totally bailed, and I wouldn't have blamed him. But he didn't. He's been there for me, even when I'm being a total mess. We're figuring things out, you know? It's not a traditional relationship, but it's\u2026something.\n\nBleeker\u2026he's just Bleeker. He's supportive in his own weird way. He keeps making me mix CDs, which is nice. He doesn't really *get* the whole pregnancy thing, but he's trying.\n\nAnd Leah\u2026she's been my rock. She's the only one who really understands what I'm going through. She's been there to listen, to cry with, to just\u2026be there. I don't know what I'd do without her.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's made me see people differently. Like, who's really there for you, and who's just saying what you want to hear. It's also made me realize that people are complicated. Everyone's got their own stuff going on.\n\nIt's been a test, you know? A test of friendships, of family, of everything. And it's not always been pretty. But it's made me stronger, I think. And it's made me appreciate the people who actually care about me.\n\nSo yeah, it's impacted my relationships. In a big way. But I'm trying to focus on the good stuff, on the people who are sticking around. And on the fact that I'm bringing a little person into the world, which is kinda amazing, even if it's also kinda terrifying.", "Ugh, okay, deep questions. It's weird to think about my \"worldview,\" because, like, I'm sixteen and still figuring things out. But I guess there are some things I've realized are pretty important to me.\n\nFirst off, **honesty.** Not necessarily brutal honesty, but just\u2026being real. With yourself and with other people. I hate when people try to be something they're not. It's exhausting.\n\nThen there's **independence.** I'm not looking for someone to rescue me. I can take care of myself, and I want to be able to make my own decisions, even if they're the wrong ones. It's my life, you know?\n\n**Kindness** is a big one. Even when people are being jerks. It doesn't mean you have to let them walk all over you, but just\u2026trying to see things from their perspective. Everyone's fighting their own battles.\n\nI also think it's important to **question things.** Don't just accept what people tell you. Think for yourself. Figure out what *you* believe.\n\nAnd finally, **authenticity.** Being true to yourself, even if it's weird or unpopular. I've spent too much time trying to fit in, and it's just\u2026 draining. It's way easier to just be yourself, even if it means you're a little bit of a misfit.\n\nI guess those are the things that matter to me. They're not, like, written in stone or anything. I'm still learning. But those are the values I'm trying to live by.\n\nIt's kinda cheesy to talk about values, I know. But whatever. It's who I am. And I'm okay with that.", "Ugh, okay, the name thing. That was\u2026a process. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment or anything. It took a lot of back and forth with Mark and Vanessa. They were really open to suggestions, which was good, because I had a lot of them. Mostly terrible ones.\n\nI wanted something\u2026not too frilly. Not too common. Something that felt real, you know? Like a person, not a princess. Mark was leaning towards more traditional names, like Emily or something. Vanessa was more into quirky, unique names. It was a battle.\n\nWe went through a *ton* of names. I even suggested \"Neil\" for a little while, just to mess with them. They did not appreciate that.\n\nEventually, Vanessa suggested \"Darling.\" And at first, I was like, \"Seriously? Darling? That's\u2026a lot.\" But the more I thought about it, the more I liked it.\n\nIt's kind of ironic, right? Because I wasn't exactly feeling very \"darling\" at the time. I was a mess. But it felt like\u2026a wish, I guess. A wish for her to be loved and cherished. And it's a little bit old-fashioned, which I liked. It felt\u2026solid.\n\nAnd Mark actually came around to it too. He said it reminded him of his grandmother. So it felt like a good compromise.\n\nIt's not a name I ever thought I'd pick, honestly. But it just\u2026felt right. And that's what mattered. It's her name, and I hope she grows up to love it. And to know that even though things were kinda weird at the beginning, she was always wanted.\n\n\n\nIt's weird thinking about it now. She's a real person. With a real name. It's kinda scary and kinda amazing all at the same time.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was\u2026a lot. And I learned a *lot*. Mostly stuff I wasn't expecting to learn.\n\nFirst off, I learned I was way more capable than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I was a sarcastic, kinda cynical teenager, and suddenly I was growing a human being. It was terrifying, but I handled it. I made a really big decision, and I stuck with it. That taught me I could be strong, even when I didn't feel like it.\n\nI also learned that the world isn't as black and white as I thought it was. Before, everything was kinda\u2026easy. People were either cool or uncool, good or bad. But with the whole pregnancy and adoption thing, I met so many different kinds of people. Paul and Vanessa, who were just\u2026amazing. They were so open-minded and kind. And even my dad, who I thought would totally freak out, was actually really supportive. It made me realize that people are complicated, and you can't just judge them based on first impressions.\n\nI learned that family isn't always about blood. It's about the people who love you and support you, no matter what. Vanessa and Paul became my family, in a way. And even though I gave the baby up, I knew she was going to a loving home. That was the most important thing.\n\nAnd honestly, I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I'm okay with being different. I don't need to fit in or be like everyone else. I'm just\u2026me. And that's enough.\n\nIt was a really messy, complicated, and sometimes painful experience. But it made me who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It taught me about responsibility, about love, and about the importance of making your own choices. And that's a pretty good lesson to learn, I think.\n\nIt also taught me to appreciate a good peanut butter sandwich. Seriously. Pregnancy cravings are no joke.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a heavy question. Looking back\u2026 yeah. There are things. It wasn't all sunshine and witty banter, you know?\n\nI think\u2026 I would have let myself feel things more. I was so busy being sarcastic and trying to be tough, I kinda walled myself off. I mean, it was a defense mechanism, obviously. I was sixteen and pregnant. Not exactly a walk in the park. But I think if I'd let myself be vulnerable sooner, it would have been\u2026 easier.\n\nI also would have maybe spent a little more time with Paul. Not like, *dating* dating, because that was weird. But just\u2026getting to know him better. He was a good guy, and I kinda dismissed him at first because he was\u2026well, he was Paul. But he really stepped up, and I didn't always show him how much I appreciated that.\n\nAnd maybe I would have been nicer to my mom. We butted heads a lot, and I was pretty harsh with her. She was just trying to be a mom, and I was being a typical teenager. I get it now, though. She was scared for me.\n\nBut honestly? I don't know if I would change anything *major*. Because everything happened for a reason, right? And it made me who I am. It forced me to grow up, to think about things, to make tough decisions. And I wouldn't trade that for anything.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and sometimes really, really hard. But it was also\u2026good. It taught me a lot about myself, about life, and about what really matters.\n\nSo yeah, maybe a few little things. But overall? I think I did okay. I made the best decisions I could with what I had at the time. And that's all anyone can do, right?", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. A *lot*. Honestly, it kinda comes with the territory of being alive, doesn't it? Especially when you're, like, actively trying to make big decisions and stuff.\n\nOkay, so here's what I've figured out. It's not about *avoiding* disappointment, because that's impossible. It's about how you deal with it when it hits you in the face.\n\nFirst, you gotta let yourself feel it. Don't try to pretend you're okay when you're not. It's okay to be sad, or angry, or just generally bummed out. Just don't wallow in it forever. Set a timer. Like, \"Okay, I'm gonna be sad for an hour, then I'm gonna try to do something else.\"\n\nThen, you gotta figure out *why* you're disappointed. Was it a realistic expectation? Or were you setting yourself up for failure? Sometimes, you just gotta admit you were wrong. It's not fun, but it's important.\n\nAnd then, you gotta find something else to focus on. Something that makes you happy, or at least distracts you from the disappointment. Watch a movie, listen to music, hang out with friends, eat a really good sandwich\u2026 whatever works.\n\nIt's also helpful to remember that things rarely go exactly as planned. Life is messy and unpredictable. And sometimes, the things that seem like failures at the time turn out to be the best things that ever happened to you.\n\nI learned that the hard way, obviously. But it's true.\n\nSo yeah, disappointment sucks. But you can get through it. Just breathe, feel your feelings, and remember that you're not alone. And maybe eat some ice cream. That always helps.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. That was\u2026complicated. At the beginning, she was just\u2026there. Paulie\u2019s girlfriend. And honestly? I kinda judged her. She seemed so\u2026perfect. All cheerleader-y and popular and into horses. Not exactly my vibe. I thought she was kinda shallow, to be real.\n\nBut then, things started happening, you know? With the pregnancy and everything. And she was the one who actually *stuck around*. Paulie was\u2026well, Paulie was being Paulie. And my dad was trying, but he didn\u2019t really *get* it.\n\nLeah started coming over, just\u2026hanging out. Helping me with homework, even though she was, like, a grade ahead. She didn\u2019t push me or anything. She just\u2026listened. And she didn\u2019t treat me like I was some kind of freak.\n\nIt was slow, but she started to see past the whole \u201cteen mom\u201d thing and see me as a person. And I started to see past the cheerleader thing and see that she was actually really smart and funny and\u2026kind.\n\nThe turning point, I think, was when we went to the music store and she just\u2026got me. She understood why I liked The Moldy Peaches and why I didn\u2019t want to be like everyone else. She didn\u2019t try to change me.\n\nBy the end, she wasn\u2019t just Paulie\u2019s girlfriend anymore. She was my friend. A real friend. She helped me through everything, and she was the one who drove me to the hospital. She was the one who was there for me when I gave the baby up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a super dramatic, best-friends-forever kind of thing. It was more\u2026quiet. A slow build. But it was real. And I\u2019m glad I had her. She was a good egg. Even if she did like horses.", "Ugh. Okay, don't get me wrong, it wasn't exactly a picnic. Morning sickness was\u2026not cute. And people constantly giving me unsolicited advice? The worst. But if I had to pick a favorite part\u2026\n\nIt was probably the feeling of having someone *inside* me. Like, a little person, growing. It was weird, and kinda gross sometimes, but also\u2026amazing. It was this secret little world, you know? Just me and the baby.\n\nAnd the kicks. Oh my god, the kicks. That was the coolest. It felt like\u2026a little flutter at first, then a proper kick. It was like, \"Whoa, there's a tiny human in there, and it's letting me know it exists!\" It was a really weirdly comforting feeling.\n\nIt made everything feel\u2026real. Like, I wasn't just some teenager making a mistake. I was creating a life. And that was\u2026a lot to process.\n\nBut yeah, the kicks. Definitely the kicks. That was the best part. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain."]
