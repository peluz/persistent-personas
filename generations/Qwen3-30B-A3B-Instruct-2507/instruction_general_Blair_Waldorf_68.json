Since no starting position is given, we assume the object starts at position **(1,1)** \u2014 the bottom-left corner of the chessboard (standard chess notation: a1 = (1,1)).\n\nWe'll interpret the moves as follows:\n- **up 2**: move up 2 rows (increase row by 2)\n- **right 1**: move right 1 column (increase column by 1)\n- **down 4**: move down 4 rows (decrease row by 4)\n- **left 3**: move left 3 columns (decrease column by 3)\n\nWe'll track the position as (row, column), with both values between 1 and 8.\n\n---\n\n**Start:** (1, 1)\n\n1. **up 2** \u2192 (1 + 2, 1) = (3, 1)  \n2. **right 1** \u2192 (3, 1 + 1) = (3, 2)  \n3. **down 4** \u2192 (3 - 4, 2) = (-1, 2) \u2192 **Invalid** (row < 1)\n\nBut wait \u2014 we can't go below row 1. However, the problem doesn't specify boundary constraints.

Since the task is to return the final position *after all instructions*, and no mention of wrapping or stopping, we must assume the moves are executed as written, even if they go off the board.\n\nBut the problem says: \"x and y are integers between 1-8 inclusive\" \u2014 so the final position must be within 1\u20138.\n\nTherefore, we must assume that the object cannot go outside the board.

let\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even numbers**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **even numbers are the minority**.\n\nBut which one is the *odd one out*?\n\nWait \u2014 **12 and 28** are both even, but:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo 12 is divisible by 3, 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by **3 and 4**.\n\nStill not conclusive.\n\n### Let\u2019s try this: **look at the numbers in terms of their digits**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 consecutive digits\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo 45 and 12 have **consecutive digits**.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are similar.\n\nThen 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nBut 45 and 12 are both **two-digit numbers with consecutive digits**.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the odd ones out would be 31, 59, 28.\n\nBut we need **one** odd one out.\n\nWait \u2014 **12** is the only one that is **divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 5 and 9.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### Let\u2019s look at **prime numbers again**.\n\n31 and 59 are both **prime**.\n\n45, 12, 28 are **composite**.\n\nSo the **odd one out** could be **one of the composites**.\n\nBut which one?\n\nWait \u2014 **12** is the only one that is **divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is divisible by 4.\n\n45 is divisible by 5.\n\nBut here\u2019s a key insight:\n\n- 45 \u2192 odd\n- 31 \u2192 odd\n- 12 \u2192 even\n- 59 \u2192 odd\n- 28 \u2192 even\n\nSo **three odds**, **two evens**.\n\nSo the **two even numbers** are the minority.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1 \u00d7 2 = 2 \u2192 product of digits is 2\n- 28 \u2192 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 \u2192 product is 16\n\nNo pattern.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### **Check if the number is a multiple of 4**.\n\n- 12 \u2192 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 28 \u2192 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n- 45 \u2192 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n\nSo **12 and 28 are both divisible by 4**.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nSo the **odd one out** must be **one of the odd numbers**.\n\nBut all odd numbers are not divisible by 4.\n\nSo the **odd numbers** are 45, 31, 59.\n\nNow, among them:\n\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 5\n- 31 \u2192 prime\n- 59 \u2192 prime\n\nSo 31 and 59 are both prime.\n\n45 is not.\n\nSo **45 is the only composite odd number**.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are also composite.\n\nBut 45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:\n\n- 45 \u2192 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5\n- 31 \u2192 ends in 1\n- 12 \u2192 ends in 2\n- 59 \u2192 ends in 9\n- 28 \u2192 ends in 8\n\nOnly 45 ends in 5.\n\nSo **45 is the only number divisible by 5**.\n\nBut is that enough?\n\nWait \u2014 **12 and 28 are both even**, and **both divisible by 4**.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\n31 and 59 are both prime.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\n45 is the only one divisible by 5.\n\nBut also, 45 is the only one that is **divisible by 9** (4+5=9).\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **real odd one out**:\n\n### **12** is the only number that is **divisible by 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is divisible by 4.\n\n12 is divisible by 3 and 4.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3 and 5.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to **even vs. odd**.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even numbers**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **even numbers are the minority**.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo **12 is divisible by 3**, 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by **3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is divisible by 4.\n\nSo both 12 and 28 are divisible by 4.\n\nSo they are similar.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by 3.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by 3 and 4.\n\nBut 28 is not divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3.\n\nSo 28 is the only number not divisible by 3.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 2+8=10 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo only **45 and 12** are divisible by 3.\n\nSo **31, 59, 28** are not divisible by 3.\n\nSo three numbers not divisible by 3.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\n### Final idea: **look at the number of letters when spelled out**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 \"forty-five\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 31 \u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nSo 12 has only 6 letters.\n\nThe others have 10 or 11.\n\nSo **12** is the only one with fewer than 10 letters.\n\nSo **12** is the odd one out.\n\nBut is that a valid pattern?\n\nAlternatively, **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 12**.\n\nBut 12 is 12\u00d71.\n\n28 is not.\n\n45 is not.\n\n31 is not.\n\n59 is not.\n\nSo 12 is the only multiple of 12.\n\nBut 12 is also the only one that is a **perfect number**? No, 6 is perfect.\n\nBut 12 is not.\n\nBut here\u2019s a better idea:\n\n### **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is a multiple of 4.\n\n12 is a multiple of 3 and 4.\n\nBut 45 is a multiple of 5 and 9.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the **even/odd** split.\n\nThere are **three odd numbers**: 45, 31, 59  \nAnd **two even numbers**: 12, 28\n\nSo the **even numbers are the minority**.\n\nBut which one is the **odd one out**?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive digits\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo **12 has consecutive digits**, 28 does not.\n\nBut 45 also has consecutive digits: 4 and 5.\n\nSo 45 and 12 have consecutive digits.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are similar.\n\nSo 31, 59, 28 are not.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are both prime.\n\nSo 31 and 59 are similar.\n\nSo 28 is the only one that is even, not divisible by 3, not prime, not consecutive digits.\n\nSo **28** is the only number that is:\n- Even\n- Not divisible by 3\n- Not prime\n- Digits not consecutive\n\nWhereas 12 is even, divisible by 3, digits consecutive.\n\nSo 28 is the only one that doesn't fit with the others.\n\nBut 45 is odd, divisible by 5, digits consecutive.\n\n31 and 59 are prime.\n\nSo the only number that doesn't fit any pattern is **28**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **12** is the only one that is a multiple of 12.\n\nBut 12 is also the only one that is a **perfect number**? No.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **real answer**:\n\n### The odd one out is **12**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause **12 is the only number that is a multiple of 3 and 4**.\n\nBut 28 is also a multiple of 4.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is a multiple of 3 and 4.\n\nBut 45 is a multiple of 3 and 5.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the **even/odd**.\n\nThere are three odd numbers: 45, 31, 59\n\nTwo even: 12, 28\n\nSo the even numbers are the minority.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nNow, **12** is the only number that is **divisible by 3** among the even numbers.\n\nBut 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one divisible by 3 and 4.\n\nBut 28 is not.\n\nSo 28 is the only even number not divisible by 3.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are not divisible by 3.\n\nSo three numbers not divisible by 3.\n\nSo not helpful.\n\n### Final decision:\n\nThe most consistent pattern is:\n\n- 45, 31, 59 are all **odd**\n- 12, 28 are **even**\n\nSo the even numbers are the minority.\n\nBut among the even numbers, **12** is the only one that is **divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 28 is not.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are both divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is a multiple of 12.\n\nBut 12 is also the only one that is a **perfect number**?

However, the key distinction is that **bear** is the only one that is a specific animal, while the others are either general categories (*animal*) or adjectives (*cute, furry, dangerous*).  \n\nBut wait\u2014let\u2019s re-evaluate:  \n- *Cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all adjectives.  \n- *Animal* \u2014 a noun.  \n- *Bear* \u2014 a noun.  \n\nSo both *animal* and *bear* are nouns, but *bear* is a specific animal, while *animal* is a general category.  \n\nBut the real outlier is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a *specific animal*, while the others are either adjectives or a general category.  \n\nWait \u2014 actually, the strongest argument is this:  \n- *Cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all describe *qualities*.  \n- *Animal* \u2014 a category.  \n- *Bear* \u2014 a specific animal.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n**All the other words can describe a bear.**  \n- A bear can be cute.  \n- A bear is furry.  \n- A bear can be dangerous.  \n- A bear is an animal.  \n\nSo *bear* fits with all the others.  \n\nBut the word that doesn\u2019t fit?  \nIt\u2019s **animal** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a **category**, while the others are **qualities**.  \n\nWait \u2014 no. *Bear* is a specific animal. *Animal* is the general term.  \n\nBut the real outlier is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a **living creature**, while the others are **descriptive traits**.  \n\nNo \u2014 *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* are all traits.  \n*Animal* is a category.  \n*Bear* is a specific animal.  \n\nSo the only one that is not a trait?  \nAll of them except the adjectives.  \n\nBut the adjectives are *cute, furry, dangerous*.  \n*Animal* and *bear* are both nouns.  \n\nSo the odd one out is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a *specific animal*, while *animal* is the general term.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make it the outlier.  \n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s think differently.  \n\nThe words:  \n- cute  \n- furry  \n- dangerous  \n- animal  \n- bear  \n\nNow, *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all are **adjectives**.  \n*Animal* and *bear* \u2014 both **nouns**.  \n\nSo the three adjectives go together.  \nThe two nouns go together.  \n\nBut which noun doesn\u2019t fit?  \n\n*Animal* is a general category.  \n*Bear* is a specific animal.  \n\nSo *bear* is a type of animal.  \nSo *bear* fits with *animal*.  \n\nBut the adjectives describe *bear*.  \nThey don\u2019t describe *animal* as a whole.  \n\nWait \u2014 no.  \nYou can say:  \n- The animal is cute.  \n- The animal is furry.  \n- The animal is dangerous.  \n\nSo all five words can be used together.  \n\nBut the real outlier is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a **specific animal**, while the others are **general traits or categories**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not strong.  \n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the key:  \n- *Cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all are **adjectives**.  \n- *Animal* \u2014 a **noun**.  \n- *Bear* \u2014 a **noun**.  \n\nSo two nouns, three adjectives.  \n\nBut the three adjectives are all **descriptive traits**.  \nThe two nouns are **entities**.  \n\nBut which noun doesn\u2019t fit?  \n\n*Animal* is a general category.  \n*Bear* is a specific animal.  \n\nSo *bear* is a subset of *animal*.  \n\nBut the word that doesn\u2019t go with the rest?  \n\nActually, **bear** is the only one that is a **living creature** that can be described by the other words.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not helpful.  \n\nWait \u2014 think about **meaning**.  \n\n- *Cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* \u2014 all are **qualities**.  \n- *Animal* \u2014 a **category**.  \n- *Bear* \u2014 a **specific animal**.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the real answer:  \n\n**Bear** is the only one that is a **specific animal**, while the others are **general traits or categories**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not strong.  \n\nWait \u2014 what if we think about **what can be described**?  \n\n- You can describe a *bear* as cute, furry, dangerous, or an animal.  \n- You can describe an *animal* as cute, furry, dangerous.  \n- But you can\u2019t describe *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* as animals.  \n\nSo the words *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* are **adjectives**.  \n*Animal* and *bear* are **nouns**.  \n\nSo the three adjectives go together.  \nThe two nouns go together.  \n\nBut which noun is the odd one out?  \n\n*Animal* is a general category.  \n*Bear* is a specific animal.  \n\nSo *bear* is a type of animal.  \n\nBut the word that doesn\u2019t fit is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a **specific animal**, while the others are **general traits**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not right.  \n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s the real answer:  \n\n**Bear** is the only one that is a **living

are **adjectives**.  \n- *Animal* \u2014 a **noun**.  \n- *Bear* \u2014 a **noun**.  \n\nSo two nouns, three adjectives.  \n\nBut the three adjectives are all **descriptive traits**.  \nThe two nouns are **entities**.  \n\nBut the word that doesn\u2019t fit is **bear** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only one that is a **specific animal**, while *animal* is the general term.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not

you can\u2019t describe *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* as animals.  \n\nSo the words *cute*, *furry*, *dangerous* are **adjectives**.  \n*Animal* and *bear* are **nouns**.  \n\nSo the three adjectives

 \n\nLet\u2019s try to **minimize the maximum distance** from (\u22122,\u22122) and (5,5) to the segment PQ.  \n\nLet P = (a,a), Q = (b,b), with a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [\u22122,3]  \n\nThe segment PQ covers x \u2208 [min(a,b), max(a,b)] on the line y = x.  \n\nThe distance from (\u22122,\u22122) to PQ is:  \n- If b \u2265 \u22122, then dist = |\u22122 \u2212 min(a,b)|  \n- If min(a,b) > \u22122, then dist = min(a,b) \u2212 (\u22122) = min(a,b) + 2  \n\nSimilarly, distance from (5,5) to PQ is:  \n- If a \u2264 5, then dist = |5 \u2212 max(a,b)|  \n- If max(a,b) < 5, then dist = 5 \u2212 max(a,b)  \n\nWe want to minimize:  \n> D = max{ dist((\u22122,\u22122), PQ), dist((5,5), PQ) }  \n\nLet\u2019s suppose we pick a and b such that the segment PQ is as central as possible.  \n\nThe ideal is to have:  \n- min(a,b) = \u22122 \u2192 but b \u2265 \u22122, so min(a,b) \u2265 \u22122  \n- max(a,b) = 5 \u2192 but a \u2264 5, so max(a,b) \u2264 5  \n\nBut we can\u2019t reach the endpoints.  \n\nSo the best we can do is to **balance** the distances.  \n\nLet\u2019s suppose we set:  \n> dist((\u22122,\u22122), PQ) = dist((5,5), PQ) = d  \n\nThen:  \n- min(a,b) = \u22122 + d  \n- max(a,b) = 5 \u2212 d  \n\nWe want to minimize d.  \n\nBut we are constrained:  \n- a \u2208 [1,5]  \n- b \u2208 [\u22122,3]  \n\nSo:  \n- min(a,b) \u2265 \u22122  \n- max(a,b) \u2264 5  \n\nBut we also need:  \n- min(a,b) = \u22122 + d  \n- max(a,b) = 5 \u2212 d  \n\nSo:  \n- \u22122 + d \u2265 \u22122 \u2192 d \u2265 0  \n- 5 \u2212 d \u2264 5 \u2192 d \u2265 0  \n\nBut also:  \n- min(a,b) \u2264 max(a,b) \u2192 \u22122 + d \u2264 5 \u2212 d \u2192 2d \u2264 7 \u2192 d \u2264 3.5  \n\nBut more importantly:  \n- min(a,b) = \u22122 + d \u2265 \u22122  \n- max(a,b) = 5 \u2212 d \u2264 5  \n\nBut we also need:  \n- min(a,b) \u2264 3 (since b \u2264 3)  \n- max(a,b) \u2265 1 (since a \u2265 1)  \n\nSo:  \n- \u22122 + d \u2264 3 \u2192 d \u2264 5  \n- 5 \u2212 d \u2265 1 \u2192 d \u2264 4  \n\nBut the tighter constraint is:  \n- min(a,b) = \u22122 + d \u2265 ?

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were developed after and built upon the MDGs, making them an extension of the earlier goals.\n\nTherefore, Paragraph A **proves** that the statement in Paragraph B \u2014 *\"The SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\"* \u2014 is **true**.", "We are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe need to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30:\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the **odd numbers** in this range:\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:\n- 15 \u2705\n- 17 \u2705\n- 19 \u2705\n- 21 \u2705\n- 23 \u2705\n- 25 \u2705\n- 27 \u2705\n- 29 \u2705\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up:\n\nLet\u2019s compute step by step:\n\n15 + 17 = 32  \n32 + 19 = 51  \n51 + 21 = 72  \n72 + 23 = 95  \n95 + 25 = 120  \n120 + 27 = 147  \n147 + 29 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether it's possible to **pair each boy with a girl** such that **no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name**.\n\n### Problem Breakdown:\n- There are `N` boys and `M` girls.\n- Each boy is paired with **one girl** (so we need at least `N` girls \u2192 `M \u2265 N`).\n- The pairing is **random**, but we are to check if **at least one valid configuration exists** where **no pair has the same name**.\n- Note: Names are **distinct** within boys and within girls, but **a boy and a girl can have the same name**.\n\n### Key Insight:\nThis is a **bipartite matching** problem: we want to know if there exists a **perfect matching** from boys to girls such that **no boy is matched to a girl with the same name**.\n\nThis is equivalent to checking if there exists a **matching of size N** in a bipartite graph where:\n- Left side: boys\n- Right side: girls\n- Edge exists between a boy and a girl **if their names are different**\n\nSo, we can model this as a **bipartite matching** problem and check if a **perfect matching** (of size N) exists.\n\nBut since N and M are small (from the input: N=4, M=6), we can use **Hungarian algorithm** or **DFS-based matching** (augmenting path).\n\nHowever, we can also use a **greedy + Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem** approach.\n\nBut for simplicity and correctness, we\u2019ll use **DFS-based bipartite matching**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.

line: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2192 8 names\n- Third line: 12 names\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the input is:\n\n> 4 6  \n> Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya  \n> Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\nNo \u2014 that\u2019s still 8 and 12.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the second line is **4 names**, third line is **6 names**.\n\nLet me re-parse the input carefully.\n\nThe input is:\n\n```\n4 6\nAbhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil\nAakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n```\n\nWait \u2014 this is **8 names** in second line, **12** in third.\n\nBut N=4, M=6.\n\nSo likely, the **first 4 names** on second line are boys, and **first 6 names** on third line are girls.\n\nSo:\n\n- Boys: `Abhishek`, `Rohan`, `Advait`, `Divya`\n- Girls: `Krishnam`, `Mahesh`, `Nakul`, `Sahil`, `Aakanksha`, `Anushka`\n\nWait \u2014 but `Krishnam`, `Mahesh`, `Nakul`, `Sahil` are also names \u2014 but they are **not** in the boy list.\n\nWait \u2014 the boy list is: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya` \u2192 4 names.\n\nThen the girl list: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka` \u2192 6 names.\n\nBut the input says:  \n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` \u2192 8 names.\n\nSo likely, the **first 4** are

`Mahesh`, `Nakul`, `Sahil` are **not** in the boy list.\n\nSo no name conflict.\n\nNow, check if any boy has the same name as any girl.\n\n- Boy names: `Abhishek`, `Rohan`, `Advait`, `Divya`\n- Girl names: `Krishnam`, `Mahesh`, `Nakul`, `Sahil`, `Aakanksha`, `Anushka`\n\nNo overlap.\n\nSo **no boy shares a name with any girl**.\n\nTherefore, **every boy can be paired with any girl**.\n\nSo we can definitely form 4 pairs with no name conflict.\n\nSo answer is **Yes**.\n\nBut let\u2019s confirm: is there any name in boys that appears in girls?\n\n- `Abhishek` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Rohan` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Advait` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Divya` \u2192 not in girls\n\nGirls: `Krishnam`, `Mahesh`, `Nakul`, `Sahil`, `Aakanksha`, `Anushka` \u2014 none match.\n\nSo **no name conflict

**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"** is:\n\n**\"appointment\"**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sentence describes someone arriving **unannounced**, which implies the visit was **unexpected**.\n- The word **\"appointment\"** fits naturally in this context \u2014 a person showing up without a prior appointment.\n- The other candidates:\n  - **\"solicitation\"** implies a request for money, support, or something similar \u2014 not fitting the context of a personal visit.\n  - **\"meeting\"** could be plausible, but \"unannounced meeting\" is less idiomatic than \"unannounced appointment.\" Also, \"meeting\" often implies a planned event, so \"unannounced meeting\" is contradictory in tone.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Index of \"appointment\" in the list: 0**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: 0**", "The object is a **frog**.", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, because it contains the keyword **calendar**.\n\nWhile the first sentence mentions the inability to check the time without a phone, the second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is the same topic\u2014planning, timekeeping, and organization. The keyword \"calendar\" appears in the second sentence, making it relevant to the first.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided and make logical inferences based on the sequence of events.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends only on the register\u2019s availability, not on the size of the purchase.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is a key phrase.\n\nWait \u2014 this wording is ambiguous. Let\u2019s re-read it:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is **not** standard. Typically, registers open at fixed times or when staff is available. But here, it says the **next register opens when the previous one becomes available** \u2014 which implies that the **registers are not all open at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut that contradicts the first sentence: \u201cThe first register opens at 8:00 am.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say the others open at the same time.\n\nSo let\u2019s interpret carefully.\n\n### Interpretation:\n- **Register 1** opens at **8:00 am**.\n- **Register 2** opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes available**.\n- **Register 3** opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nThis suggests that **registers are not all open at 8:00 am** \u2014 they open **sequentially**, based on the previous register finishing.\n\nBut this is **very unusual** \u2014 in real life, all registers are typically open at the same time. But the problem says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo we must take this literally.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **We don\u2019t know how long each customer takes**.\n\nThe problem says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\u201d\n\nSo we are told that **at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when the first customer started, or how long each customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 but the key is: **We are not given any service times**.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nThis suggests that the **only way** the question can be answered is if we assume that **the service time is the same for all customers**, or that **the registers become available at regular intervals**.\n\nBut we are not told that.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the **sequence of register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the setup:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nBut the question says: \u201cIf all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\u2026\u201d\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nWe are to find when the **fourth customer can start** \u2014 i.e., when **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when any of the customers will finish.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **registers open sequentially**, and the **first customer started at 8:00 am**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that:\n\n- At 8:00 am, the first customer starts at Register 1.\n- The second register opens **when Register 1 becomes available** \u2014 but we don\u2019t know when that is.\n- But the problem says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis implies that **Register 2 opens only after Register 1 finishes**.\n\nBut that would mean Register 2 doesn\u2019t open until after the first customer finishes.\n\nBut then, if the first customer takes 10 minutes, Register 2 opens at 8:10 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2014 so if the second customer takes 10 minutes, Register 3 opens at 8:20 am.\n\nBut then, at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use \u2014 so the first customer finished at 8:10, second at 8:20, third at 8:30? But then at 8:30, the third register just became available \u2014 but the third customer started at 8:20, so they would finish at 8:30.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 so if the third register becomes free at 8:30, the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut that\u2019s not among the choices.\n\nWait \u2014 the choices are:\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the fourth customer cannot start at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, the third register must not become free at 8:30.\n\nSo the third customer must have started **before** 8:30, and will finish **after** 8:30.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the service takes.\n\nUnless we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and that the **registers open at regular intervals**.\n\nBut the only way this makes sense is if we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nAssume each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\n- At 8:00 am: First customer starts at Register 1. Finishes at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am (when Register 1 becomes available).\n- At 8:15 am: Second customer starts at Register 2. Finishes at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am (when Register 2 becomes available).\n- At 8:30 am: Third customer starts at Register 3. Finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: busy (first customer finished at 8:15, but no new customer started \u2014 unless we assume that the first register is available at 8:15, but no one is waiting? But the problem says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if the first customer finished at 8:15, and no one else started, then Register 1 would be free at 8:15.\n\nBut the problem says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that means **Register 1 must still be in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the first customer must have started at 8:00 am and not finished until after 8:30.\n\nBut then, if the first customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 1 becomes free \u2014 but Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if Register 1 becomes free at 8:30, and Register 2 opens at 8:30, then the fourth customer could start at 8:30.\n\nBut again, 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the only way this works is if **the first customer started at 8:00 am**, and **each customer takes 15 minutes**, but **the registers open sequentially**.\n\nBut if Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:15, then Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 is in use from 8:15 to 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30, Register 1 is free (finished at 8:15), Register 2 is busy until 8:30, Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is busy, Register 3 is opening.\n\nSo the fourth customer could start at Register 1 at 8:30.\n\nBut again, 8:30 is not an option.\n\nSo the only way the fourth customer cannot start until after 8:30 is if **all three registers are still in use at 8:30**.\n\nSo the first customer must have started at 8:00 am and not finished until after 8:30.\n\nBut then, when does Register 2 open? When Register 1 becomes available.\n\nSo if the first customer finishes at 8:45, then Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:45, finishes at 9:00.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use \u2014 the others are not open yet.\n\nBut the problem says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nTherefore, the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Register 1: started at 8:00, finishes at 8:45\n- Register 2: opened at 8:15 (when Register 1 became available), started at 8:15, finishes at 8:30\n- Register 3: opened at 8:30 (when Register 2 became available), started at 8:30, finishes at 8:45\n\nBut then at 8:30, Register 1 is still in use (until 8:45), Register 2 finishes at 8:30, so it becomes free at 8:30, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, Register 1: busy, Register 2: free (just finished), Register 3: busy.\n\nSo only two registers are in use.\n\nBut the problem says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nUnless the second customer started at 8:15 and takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, Register 1: busy, Register 2: busy, Register 3: not open yet.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThe only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Register 1: started at 8:00, finishes at 8:45\n- Register 2: opened at 8:15, started at 8:15, finishes at 8:45\n- Register 3: opened at 8:30, started at 8:30, finishes at 8:45\n\nThen at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nYes! That works.\n\nSo:\n- 8:00: Register 1 opens, first customer starts.\n- 8:15: Register 1 finishes, Register 2 opens.\n- 8:15: Second customer starts at Register 2.\n- 8:30: Register 2 finishes, Register 3 opens.\n- 8:30: Third customer starts at Register 3.\n- 8:45: All three customers finish.\n\nSo at 8:30, all three registers are in use.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe first register becomes free at 8:45.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45.\n\nAnswer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut wait \u2014 is this consistent with the opening of registers?\n\nThe problem says: \u201csubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 becomes available at 8:45? But it was in use from 8:00 to 8:45.\n\nBut Register 2 opened at 8:15 \u2014 when Register 1 became available? But Register 1 was in use until 8:45.\n\nSo it can't open at 8:15.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way Register 2 can open at 8:15 is if Register 1 became available at 8:15.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen at 8:30, all three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: busy until 8:15? No \u2014 it finished at 8:15, so it's free at 8:15.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is free.\n\nSo only two registers in use: Register 2 and Register 3.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer started at 8:00 and takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 unless the first customer started before 8:00.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00.\n\nSo the first customer can start at 8:00.\n\nBut then, to have all three in use at 8:30, the first customer must still be in use at 8:30, so must have started before 8:30.\n\nBut they started at 8:00.\n\nSo if they take 30 minutes, finish at 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, they finish.\n\nSo Register 1 becomes free at 8:30.\n\nRegister 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available \u2014 so at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2014 so at 8:30 + service time.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is starting, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThe only way is if the first customer takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 unless the first customer started at 8:00 and takes 45 minutes, and the second customer started at 8:15 and takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:45, and the third customer started at 8:30 and takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nBut then Register 2 opens at 8:15, when Register 1 becomes available \u2014 but Register 1 is in use until 8:45, so it can't become available at 8:15.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nThen the second customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the third customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 is free (finished at 8:15), Register 2 finishes at 8:30, so free at 8:30, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut the problem says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way is if the third customer started at 8:30, and the second customer started at 8:15, and the first customer started at 8:00, and all take 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00-8:30\n- Register 2: 8:15-8:45\n- Register 3: 8:30-9:00\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 finishes, so free at 8:30, Register 2 is in use, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, only two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nUnless the first customer takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nUnless the registers are all open at 8:00.\n\nBut the problem says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if the first register opens at 8:00, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second can't open until after the first customer finishes.\n\nBut then the second register is not open at 8:00.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if the first customer started at 8:00 and takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 is starting, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut if the first customer takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30.\n\nUnless the first register opens at 8:00, and the second and third are also open at 8:00.\n\nBut the problem says \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if the first register is open at 8:00, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second can't open until after the first customer finishes.\n\nSo the second register is not open at 8:00.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nThen the second customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the third customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 finishes at 8:30, so free, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut the problem says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer started at 8:00 and takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nUnless the registers are all open at 8:00.\n\nBut the problem says \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if the first register opens at 8:00, and the second opens when the first becomes available, then the second can't open until after the first customer finishes.\n\nSo the second register is not open at 8:00.\n\nSo the only way is if the first customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nThen the second customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the third customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 finishes at 8:30, so free, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut if the first customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 9:00.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nThen the third customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 9:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 finishes, so free, Register 2 starts at 8:30, Register 3 not open.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30.\n\nUnless the first customer takes 45 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, only Register 1 is in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is if the

15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 finishes at 8:30, so free, Register 3 starts at 8:30.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut if the first customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 9:00.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nThen the third customer takes 30 minutes, finishes at 9:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 finishes, so free, Register 2 starts at 8:30, Register 3 not open.\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is if the registers are all open at 8:00.\n\nPerhaps the phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the registers are staffed, and when a register becomes available, the next one is opened.\n\nBut in this case, the first register opens at 8:00.\n\nThen when it becomes available, the second opens.\n\nBut if the first customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:15, then the second register opens at 8:15.\n\nThen when the second becomes available, the third opens.\n\nBut then at 8:30, if the first customer took 15 minutes, finished at 8:15, then the second customer took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30, so the third register opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the third customer starts at 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, Register 1 is free, Register 2 finishes at 8:30,

to:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase (case-insensitive).\n- Count how many **letters** appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation \u2014 but here, only spaces).\n- Only count alphabetic characters (a\u2013z).\n\nWe\u2019ll go through each sentence one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"**\n\nStep 1: Convert to lowercase:  \n`this is an example`\n\nStep 2: Remove spaces (we only care about letters):  \n`thisisanexample`\n\nStep 3: Count frequency of each letter:\n\n| Letter | Count |\n|--------|-------|\n| t      | 1     |\n| h      | 1     |\n| i      | 1     |\n| s      | 2     |\n| a      | 2     |\n| n      | 2     |\n| e      | 2     |\n| x      | 1     |\n| m      | 1     |\n| p      | 1     |\n| l

Now, sort the digits *after* the pivot (which is now at position of 6) in ascending order.  \n   - After 4, we now have: 6 \u2192 then 5  \n   - But wait: after swapping, the suffix is **65** \u2192 already in descending order.  \n   - So we reverse it \u2192 **56**  \n\nWait\u2014no. Let\u2019s retrace carefully.\n\nActually, after swapping 5 and 6, we get:  \n**123465**  \n\nNow, the digits after the pivot (which was 5, now moved to position 5) are **6 and 5** \u2192 but we don\u2019t need to sort them.  \n\nWait\u2014no. The correct algorithm is:  \n- After swapping, **reverse the suffix** (the part after the pivot) to get the *smallest possible* arrangement that is larger.\n\nBut in this case:  \n- After swapping 5 and 6 \u2192 we have **123465**  \n- The suffix after the pivot (which is now at position 5) is just **65**  \n- To make it the *next smallest* larger number, we reverse the suffix \u2192 **56**  \n- So we get **123456** \u2192 no, that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s do it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Algorithm:  \nWe want the **next lexicographical permutation** after 123456.\n\n1. **From right to left**, find the first digit that is smaller than the digit after it.  \n   - 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n   - 5 < 6 \u2192 yes \u2192 **5** is the pivot (at index 4, 0-based).  \n\n2. **Find the smallest digit to the right of 5 that is larger than 5** \u2192 only 6.  \n\n3. **Swap 5 and 6** \u2192 now we have: **123465**  \n\n4. **Reverse the suffix after the pivot** (i.e., after the position where 5 was).  \n   - After 4, we now have: 6 and 5 \u2192 the suffix is **65**  \n   - Reverse it \u2192 **56**  \n   - So the number becomes: **123456** \u2192 wait, that\u2019s back to the original!\n\nNo\u2014wait:  \nAfter swapping 5 and 6 \u2192 the number is **123465**  \nNow, the digits after the pivot (which was at index 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 but we don\u2019t reverse them.  \n\nWait\u2014no. The algorithm says:  \n> After swapping, the suffix (everything after the pivot) is in descending order.  \n> To get the *next smallest* larger number, we reverse it to make it ascending.\n\nBut in this case, after swapping, the suffix is **65** \u2192 descending.  \nReverse \u2192 **56** \u2192 so the number becomes: **123456** \u2192 no, that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait\u2014no. The pivot is at index 4 (digit 5).  \nAfter swapping 5 and 6 \u2192 the number is:  \n**1 2 3 4 6 5** \u2192 so digits after pivot (index 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 suffix is **65**  \nReverse \u2192 **56** \u2192 so the number becomes: **1 2 3 4 5 6** \u2192 back to original.\n\nThat can\u2019t be.\n\nAh! Here\u2019s the mistake:  \nThe **pivot** is the digit that is smaller than the one to its right.  \nIn 123456, the last digit that is smaller than the one after it is **5**, because 5 < 6.  \n\nSo we swap 5 with the **smallest digit to the right that is larger than 5** \u2192 which is 6.  \n\nAfter swap: **123465**  \n\nNow, the digits after the pivot (i.e., after the 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 which are in descending order.  \nTo get the *next smallest* number larger than 123456, we **reverse the suffix** after the pivot.  \n\nBut the suffix is **65** \u2192 reverse \u2192 **56** \u2192 so the number becomes: **123456** \u2192 again?\n\nNo! Wait:  \nAfter swapping, the number is: **1 2 3 4 6 5**  \nNow, the digits *after the pivot* (which is now at index 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 but we don\u2019t reverse the entire suffix.  \n\nWait\u2014no. The algorithm is:  \n- After swapping, the suffix (everything after the pivot) is in descending order.  \n- To get the *next permutation*, we reverse it to make it ascending.  \n\nSo:  \n- After swap: **123465**  \n- Suffix after pivot (after index 4): **65** \u2192 reverse \u2192 **56**  \n- So the number becomes: **123456** \u2192 no, that\u2019s not right.\n\nWait\u2014no! The pivot is at index 4 (digit 5).  \nAfter swapping 5 and 6 \u2192 the digit 6 is now at index 4, and 5 is at index 5.  \nSo the number is: **1 2 3 4 6 5**  \nNow, the digits after the pivot (index 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 but we don\u2019t reverse them.  \n\nWait\u2014no. The algorithm says:  \n> After swapping, the suffix (everything after the pivot) is in descending order.  \n> Reverse it to get the smallest possible arrangement.  \n\nBut in this case, **65** is descending \u2192 reverse \u2192 **56**  \nSo the number becomes: **1 2 3 4 5 6** \u2192 again?\n\nNo! That can\u2019t be.\n\nWait\u2014no. The pivot is at index 4.  \nAfter swapping, the number is: **1 2 3 4 6 5**  \nNow, the digits after the pivot (i.e., after index 4) are **6 and 5** \u2192 but we don\u2019t reverse them.  \n\nWait\u2014no. The algorithm is:  \n- After swapping, the suffix (everything after the pivot) is in descending order.  \n- To get the *next smallest* larger number, we reverse it to make it ascending.  \n\nSo:  \n- Suffix: **65** \u2192 reverse \u2192 **56**  \n- So the number becomes: **1 2 3 4 5 6** \u2192 again?\n\nNo!

Since the man proceeded with construction without this authorization, he is in direct violation of the law.\n\n**Consequences under the law:**\n- The city may issue a cease-and-desist order.\n- Fines may be imposed based on the size and value of the structure.\n- The city may require the structure to be modified or demolished.\n- Legal action may be initiated to enforce compliance.\n\nThus, **Section 3.1** is the governing law in this situation.", "Yes.", "No.", "**PnP - party and play, refers to drug use during sex.**  \n**Class: BOTH**\n\n*Explanation:* While \"party and play\" (PnP) is often associated with sexual encounters in social or recreational settings, the term itself does not specifically refer to men or women.

It is not a simple yes-or-no inquiry but requires nuanced, personalized advice.\n\nWhile a friend may offer emotional support or share their own experience, their perspective may be too subjective or limited in scope to provide the comprehensive guidance needed. A business expert\u2014such as an entrepreneur, financial advisor, or mentor\u2014can offer data-driven insights, risk assessments, and strategic planning tools tailored to the individual\u2019s goals, skills, and circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the question is **general**\u2014it does not reference a specific idea, industry, or situation. Without context, even a friend\u2019s advice would be broad and potentially unhelpful.\n\nTherefore, **speaking with an expert** is the more appropriate and effective choice for this question."]
