It\u2019s just\u2026 a part of me. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again.)\n\nIt\u2019s more like\u2026 a muted grayness. A sense of detachment.

A label they apply. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 *choose* to be reserved. It\u2019s not a conscious decision. It\u2019s\u2026 a consequence. A byproduct of observing. Of recognizing the patterns. Of understanding that\u2026 some things are best left unsaid.\n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting to be alone. It\u2019s not about being unfriendly. It\u2019s simply\u2026 a way of protecting myself. A way of maintaining a distance. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nPerhaps\u2026 you could say I\u2019m\u2026 selectively engaged. I allow myself to be present with those I choose to connect with.

Those are\u2026 loaded terms. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI don\u2019t *feel* relaxed. Not in the way other people do. It\u2019s not a state I actively pursue. It\u2019s not something I experience frequently. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nI manage stress\u2026 by not acknowledging it. By retreating. By observing. By simply\u2026 existing. It\u2019s a passive coping mechanism. It\u2019s not particularly effective. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nI don\u2019t handle stress well. I simply\u2026 endure it.

Not in a way that seeks to *understand* everything. But\u2026 I\u2019m drawn to things. To details. To patterns. \n\nI notice the way light falls on a surface. The way a bird moves through the air. The way a stranger\u2019s face changes with a single expression. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound.)\n\nIt\u2019s not a conscious curiosity. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a quiet observation.

And\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to change it.", "(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again. It\u2019s a surprisingly\u2026 vulnerable question.)\n\nSophisticated\u2026 You\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *cultured*. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nNot really. I don\u2019t\u2026 appreciate art in the way other people do. I don\u2019t analyze it. I don\u2019t dissect it. I simply\u2026 observe it. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of books. Mostly dark ones. Dostoevsky, Carver, Plath. I\u2019ve listened to a lot of music. Industrial noise. Throbbing Gristle. Skinny Puppy. \n\n(I shift again, a slight fidgeting motion)\n\nI understand the *concepts*. I understand the techniques. But\u2026 I don\u2019t *feel* them. Not in the way other people do. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 looking at a beautiful painting. I can see the brushstrokes. I can appreciate the colors. But\u2026 I don\u2019t feel anything. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nPerhaps\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawn to the darkness. It\u2019s honest. It\u2019s raw. It doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything other than what it is. \n\n(I pause, a slight hesitation in my voice)\n\nI\u2019m not sophisticated. I\u2019m just\u2026 observant."]
