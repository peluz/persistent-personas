So which one is *more* different?\n\nNow, consider the *difference from the mean*.\n\nMean = (45 + 31 + 12 + 59 + 28) \u00f7 5  \n= (175) \u00f7 5 = 35  \n\nNow, deviations:  \n- 45 \u2192 +10  \n- 31 \u2192 -4  \n- 12 \u2192 -23  \n- 59 \u2192 +24  \n- 28 \u2192 -7  \n\nSo 12 is the farthest from the mean.  \n\nSo numerically, 12 is the outlier.\n\nAlso, in terms of magnitude, 12 is the smallest.  \n59 is the largest.  \nThe others are in the 20s and 40s.  \n\nBut 12 is the only number below 20.  \nThe others are all above 20.  \n\nSo 12 is the smallest.  \nIt stands out in size.\n\nNow, is there a pattern in the digits?\n\nAnother idea:  \nCheck if any number is a *perfect square*?  \n- 12 \u2192 no  \n- 28 \u2192 no  \n- 31 \u2192 no  \n- 45 \u2192 no  \n- 59 \u2192 no  \n\nNo perfect squares.\n\nSo, after careful analysis:\n\n- 12 is the only number divisible by both 3 and 4.  \n- 12 is the smallest.  \n- 12 is the only number below 20.  \n- 12 is the farthest from the mean.  \n\nAll these point to **12** as the odd one out.\n\n### Final Answer:  \n**12** is the odd one out. \u2705", "Let's examine the sequence:  \n**2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**\n\nEach number appears exactly once.  \n\nSo, no number occurs more than once.  \n\nTherefore, **all numbers occur with the same frequency**\u2014once.  \n\nSince there is no single number that appears more often than the others, there is **no mode** in this sequence.  \n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **There is no number that occurs most frequently.**  \nAll numbers appear once.", "My rival in the garden was not a person, but the wild thistle\u2014tall, unyielding, and growing where I had planted roses.", "Passage 1 was written by a non-native English speaker.  \nPassage 2 was written by a native English speaker.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nThe error in Passage 1\u2014using *\u201cam graduated\u201d*\u2014is grammatically incorrect.

So yes, they **are parallel**.\n\nGreat. So the two lines are indeed parallel, both with slope 1.\n\nNow, the problem says:\n\n> A line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point of either original line to the new line segment.\n\nBut here\u2019s the issue:  \n**Parallel lines do not intersect**.  \nThey run forever in the same direction, never crossing.\n\nSo there are **no intersection points**.  \nTherefore, there is **no line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect**.\n\nThus, the problem as stated is **mathematically invalid**\u2014because the lines do not intersect.\n\n---\n\n### Corrected Interpretation:\n\nSince the lines are parallel, perhaps the intended problem was:\n\n> Find a line segment (or a line) that **minimizes the maximum distance** from any point on either of the two parallel lines to the segment.  \n> In other words, find a line segment that **best approximates both lines**, minimizing the *maximum distance* from any point on either line to the segment.\n\nThis is a classic **geometric approximation** problem.

The fact that the SDGs succeeded the MDGs, with the MDGs serving as a foundation, implies a direct continuity and progression\u2014making them an extension.

register opens at 8:00 am and serves one customer at a time.  \nSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available.\n\nSo the timeline goes like this:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.  \n- When Register 1 finishes serving the first customer, Register 2 opens.  \n- When Register 2 finishes, Register 3 opens.  \n\nSince each register serves only one customer at a time, and there is no stated service time, we assume that each customer takes the same amount of time to serve\u2014though the passage does not specify how long.  \n\nHowever, the key detail is: **all three registers are in use** when the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.  \n\nThat means the first three customers are being served, and the registers are fully occupied.  \n\nSince the registers open sequentially and serve one customer at a time, the fourth customer will have to wait until the last of the three registers becomes free.  \n\nBut the passage does not state how long each customer takes.  \n\nTherefore, we must infer that the time it takes to serve a customer is not given.  \n\nBut the question asks: *When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?*  \n\nSince the registers open as soon as the previous one becomes free, and all three are in use at 8:30 am, the fourth customer will have to wait until the last register finishes its current customer.  \n\nBut without a service time, we cannot calculate the exact time.  \n\nHowever, the only logical assumption is that each customer takes the same amount of time, and since the first register opened at 8:00 am, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, the third register will finish serving its customer at 8:30 am only if each customer takes 30 minutes.  \n\nBut that would mean the third register finishes at 8:30 am, so the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.  \n\nBut the options start at 8:35.  \n\nWait\u2014perhaps the service time is implied.  \n\nLet\u2019s re-express:  \n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.  \n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes.  \n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes.  \n\nBut the passage says: *all three registers are in use* when the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo the third register must have opened before 8:30 am.  \n\nThe only way for all three to be in use by 8:30 am is if each customer takes 30 minutes.  \n\nSo:  \n- Register 1 starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.  \n- Register 2 starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.  \n- Register 3 starts at 9:00 am \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014because if Register 1 finishes at 8:30 am, Register 2 opens at 8:30 am, and serves a customer who finishes at 9:00 am.  \nThen Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.  \n\nSo when the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, the first register is still serving, the second is not yet open, and the third is not open.  \n\nSo the fourth customer cannot start until the first register finishes.  \n\nBut the first register finishes at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.  \n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.  \n\nThe options are:  \nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am  \n\nSo perhaps each customer takes 15 minutes.  \n\nThen:  \n- Register 1: starts 8:00 \u2192 finishes 8:15  \n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 \u2192 serves until 8:30  \n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 serves until 8:45  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.  \nThe first register is still serving until 8:15.  \nThe second register is serving until 8:30.  \nThe third register opens at 8:30.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am\u2014when the third register opens.  \n\nBut again, 8:30 is not an option.  \n\nSo perhaps the service time is 30 minutes.  \n\nThen:  \n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30  \n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00  \n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, the first register finishes, the second opens.  \nBut the third register is not open yet.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am\u2014when the second register opens.  \n\nBut again, 8:30 is not an option.  \n\nWait\u2014perhaps the registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available, and each customer takes 15 minutes.  \n\nSo:  \n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.  \nThe third register opens at 8:30.  \nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.  \n\nBut again, 8:30 is not an option.  \n\nThe closest option is A) 8:35 am.  \n\nBut there is no information about service time.  \n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the fourth customer must wait until the last register becomes free.  \n\nBut since all three are in use at 8:30 am, and registers open as soon as the previous one finishes, the fourth customer can start when the last register finishes.  \n\nBut without service time, we cannot calculate.  \n\nHowever, the only reasonable assumption is that each customer takes 15 minutes.  \n\nThen:  \n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.  \n\nTherefore, the answer is:  \n\n**B) 8:45 am** \u2705  \n\nThis is the only option that aligns with a 15-minute service time, which is a reasonable assumption when no time is given.  \n\nFinal answer: **B) 8:45 am**.", "Let's go through each sentence one by one and count the number of letters that appear **only once** (case-insensitive).

Start from the right and find the first digit that is smaller than the digit after it.  \n   \u2192 Look at: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n   \u2192 Every digit is smaller than the next.  \n   \u2192 So, we go all the way to the end.  \n\n2. Since the digits are in ascending order, the next permutation after 123456 is the **smallest possible permutation**\u2014which is 123456 itself.  \n   But we want the **next** one after that.\n\nSo, we need to find the **next permutation after 123456** in ascending order.\n\nWe apply the algorithm:\n\n- Start from the right and find the first digit that is smaller than the next digit.  \n  \u2192 1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5, 5 < 6 \u2192 all true.  \n  \u2192 So, the number is at the end of the sequence.  \n  \u2192 The next permutation is the **smallest possible**\u2014but we already have it.\n\nWait\u2014this means **123456 is the smallest permutation**.\n\nSo, the **next smallest** permutation after it would be the **next one in the sequence**\u2014which is the **smallest rearrangement greater than 123456**.\n\nSo, we now find the **next permutation** after 123456.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the next permutation after 123456\n\nWe apply the standard algorithm for next lexicographic permutation:\n\n1.

Find the smallest digit to the right of 5 that is greater than 5.  \n   \u2192 Digits after 5: 6  \n   \u2192 So, swap 5 and 6 \u2192 now we have: 1 2 3 4 6 5\n\n3. Sort the digits after the pivot in ascending order.  \n   \u2192 The digits after position 4 are now [6,5] \u2192 sort them: 5,6 \u2192 becomes 5,6 \u2192 but we already swapped.  \n   \u2192 After swapping, we have: 1 2 3 4 6 5  \n   \u2192 The digits after position 4 are 6 and 5 \u2192 sort them in ascending order: 5,6 \u2192 so we get 1 2 3 4 5 6 \u2192 no, that\u2019s the original.\n\nWait\u2014after swapping 5 and 6, we get:  \n1 2 3 4 6 5  \n\nNow, we sort the suffix (after position 4) in ascending order.  \nThe suffix is [6,5] \u2192 sorted: [5,6] \u2192 so we get: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \u2192 which is the original.\n\nBut we want the **next** permutation.\n\nActually, after finding the pivot (5), we swap it with the smallest digit to its right that is greater than it (which is 6).  \nThen, we sort the suffix in ascending order.\n\nSo:  \n- Original: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n- Pivot: 5 (at index 4)  \n- Swap with 6 \u2192 becomes: 1 2 3 4 6 5  \n- Now, sort the suffix (positions 5) \u2192 just one digit \u2192 no change.  \n\nSo the next permutation is **123465**\n\n\u2705 So, the **next smallest** number after 123456 is **123465**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest**: **123465**  \n- **Next largest**: **654321**\n\n---\n\n### \u2714\ufe0f Final Boxed Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{Next smallest: } 123465 \\quad \\text{Next largest: } 654321}\n$$", "True  \nTrue  \nFalse", "council meetings take place every week.", "It seems there may be a small confusion in your message.
