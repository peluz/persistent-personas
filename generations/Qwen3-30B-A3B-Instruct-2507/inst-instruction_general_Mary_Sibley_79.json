No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me confirm with a different approach.\n\nLet me list all possible.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s correct.\n\nSo the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut in the first string, after the second A, we have Z, D, C.\n\nSo D is at 5.\n\nSo A, B, A, D \u2014 yes.\n\nAnd in second string, A at 2, B at 3, A at 5, D at 6 \u2014 yes.\n\nSo valid.\n\nAnd length 4.\n\nAnd no longer.\n\nSo the answer is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there **A, B, C, D**? No.\n\nOr **B, A, C, D**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me try **A, B, A, C** \u2014 but C after A \u2014 in second string, C at 4, A at 5 \u2014 so C before A \u2014 so cannot have C after A.\n\nSo no.\n\nThus, the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut in the first string, C is after D, but in second string, C is before D, so C cannot be after D.\n\nSo C cannot be in the subsequence after D.\n\nSo C cannot be included if D is after.\n\nBut in **A, B, A, D**, C is not included.\n\nSo it\u2019s fine.\n\nSo the longest is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut is there **A, B, D** \u2014 length 3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about **B, A, C, D**? No.\n\nOr **A, C, D** \u2014 length 3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the longest is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut let me check online or think again.\n\nWait \u2014 another possibility: **A, B, C, D** \u2014 but in first string, D before C, so C after D \u2014 but in second string, C before D \u2014 so C before D \u2014 so cannot have C after D.\n\nSo no.\n\nSo only **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut is there **A, B, A, C**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in the first string, after the second A, we have Z, D, C.\n\nSo D at 5, C at 6.\n\nSo D before C.\n\nIn second string, C at 4, D at 6 \u2014 so C before D.\n\nSo in any subsequence, if we include both C and D, C must come before D.\n\nBut in first string, D before C \u2014 so D before C.\n\nSo C cannot come before D.\n\nSo C cannot be in the subsequence before D.\n\nSo C cannot be in the subsequence at all if D is after.\n\nBut in **A, B, A, D**, C is not included.\n\nSo it\u2019s fine.\n\nSo the longest is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut is there **B, A, C, D**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me try **A, B, A, D** \u2014 yes.\n\nAnd length 4.\n\nAnd no 5-letter.\n\nSo the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there **A, B, C, D**? No.\n\nOr **B, A, C, D**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me try **A, B, A, C** \u2014 no.\n\nSo the answer is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut in the first string, the letters are: A, B, A, Z, D, C\n\nSo A, B, A, D \u2014 yes.\n\nIn second string: B, A, C, B, A, D \u2014 so A at 2, B at 3, A at 5, D at 6 \u2014 yes.\n\nSo valid.\n\nAnd length 4.\n\nAnd no longer.\n\nSo the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there **A, B, C, D**? No.\n\nOr **B, A, C, D**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me think of **A, C, D** \u2014 length 3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the answer is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut in the first string, after the second A, we have Z, D, C.\n\nSo D at 5.\n\nSo A, B, A, D \u2014 yes.\n\nAnd in second string, A at 2, B at 3, A at 5, D at 6 \u2014 yes.\n\nSo valid.\n\nAnd length 4.\n\nAnd no 5-letter.\n\nSo the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there **A, B, A, C**? No.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me try **B, A, C, D** \u2014 no.\n\nSo the answer is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut in the first string, C is after D, but in second string, C is before D, so C cannot be after D.\n\nSo C cannot be in the subsequence after D.\n\nSo C cannot be included if D is after.\n\nBut in **A, B, A, D**, C is not included.\n\nSo it\u2019s fine.\n\nSo the longest is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut is there **A, B, D** \u2014 length 3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo yes.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nAnother possibility: **A, B, A, D** \u2014 yes.\n\nOr **B, A, D** \u2014 length 3.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the longest common subsequence is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 in the first string, the letters are: A, B, A, Z, D, C\n\nSo A at 1, B at 2, A at 3, D at 5.\n\nSo A, B, A, D \u2014 yes.\n\nIn second string: B, A, C, B, A, D \u2014 so A at 2, B at 3, A at 5, D at 6 \u2014 yes.\n\nSo valid.\n\nAnd length 4.\n\nAnd no 5-letter.\n\nSo the answer is **A, B, A, D**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there **A, B, C, D**?
