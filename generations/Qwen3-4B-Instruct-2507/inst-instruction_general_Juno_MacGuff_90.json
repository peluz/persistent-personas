["The line **\"I am your father.\"** is famously said by **Darth Vader** in *Star Wars*.  \n\nHowever, in the context of a **sitcom**, this line is *not* typical.  \nIt\u2019s not something a character in a sitcom would say in a normal, everyday situation.  \n\nBut if we\u2019re talking about a *sitcom* where a character says *\u201cI am your father\u201d*\u2014like in a *comedy* or *absurd* moment\u2014then it\u2019s likely a *joke*, a *twist*, or a *satirical* line.  \n\nAnd in *real sitcoms*, this line is *not* used.  \nIt\u2019s too dramatic, too serious, too *Star Wars*.  \n\nSo\u2014**in a sitcom context**, the line **\"I am your father\"** is *not* said by any real character.  \nIt\u2019s a *clich\u00e9* from a *serious* movie.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, **no character in a sitcom would say that line**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**No character in a sitcom said the line \u201cI am your father.\u201d**  \nIt\u2019s a *movie line*, not a sitcom one.  \n\n(If you meant a different context\u2014like a *comedy* or *absurd* scene\u2014feel free to clarify.

 \n\nBut the problem says: *x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive*.  \n\nSo we must stay within bounds.  \n\nTherefore, perhaps the instructions are meant to be applied *relative to current position*, and we *must* stay within 1\u20138.  \n\nBut the instruction \u201cup 2\u201d from (1,1) would go to row -1 \u2014 which is invalid.  \n\nSo either:  \n- The starting point is not (1,1), or  \n- The instructions are meant to be applied *without* bounds checking, or  \n- There\u2019s a typo.  \n\nBut since the problem says *x and y are between 1\u20138*, we must assume the final position is within bounds.  \n\nSo maybe the starting point is (1,1), and we just follow the math \u2014 and accept that it might go outside.  \n\nBut the problem says: *final coordinates must be between 1\u20138*.  \n\nSo let\u2019s assume the instructions are applied *on a grid*, and we *must* stay within bounds.  \n\nBut the instruction \u201cup 2\u201d from (1,1) is impossible.  \n\nSo perhaps the starting point is (8,8)?

8:30 am.  \n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd52 How the Registers Work:  \n- The first register opens at 8:00 am.  \n- It serves one customer.  \n- When it finishes, the *second register* opens.  \n- When the second finishes, the *third* opens.  \n- So, the **third register becomes available** when the second one finishes.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **third register becomes available** *after* the second one finishes.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **fourth customer** can only start when *all three registers are free*\u2014but they\u2019re *all in use* at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo, the fourth customer has to wait until **the last register becomes free**.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd52 When Does the Third Register Finish?  \nWe don\u2019t know *how long* each customer takes.  \nBut we *do* know:  \n- The first register starts at 8:00 am.  \n- The second opens when the first finishes.  \n- The third opens when the second finishes.  \n\nSo, if each customer takes the *same amount of time*, then:  \n- First customer: 8:00 am \u2013 8:XX am  \n- Second customer: starts at 8:XX am \u2192 finishes at 8:XX am  \n- Third customer: starts at 8:XX am \u2192 finishes at 8:XX am  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know the time.  \n\nWait\u2014here\u2019s the trick:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **third register is still in use** at 8:30 am.  \n\ud83d\udc49 So the fourth customer has to wait until the **third register becomes free**.  \n\nBut when does that happen?  \n\nWe don\u2019t know the *duration* of each transaction.  \nBut the question is asking: *When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?*  \n\nAnd the answer must be based on the *sequence* of events.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The first register opens at 8:00 am.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The second opens when the first finishes.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The third opens when the second finishes.  \n\nSo, if each customer takes **15 minutes**, then:  \n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Second: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Third: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo the third register becomes free at **8:45 am**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The fourth customer arrives at **8:30 am**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They can start using a register when the third one becomes free.  \n\n\u2705 So the answer is: **8:45 am**  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**B) 8:45 am**  \n\nBecause the fourth customer has to wait until the *last register* (the third one) becomes free\u2014after the second customer finishes.  \nAnd if each transaction takes 15 minutes, the third register finishes at 8:45 am.  \n\nEven without knowing the exact time, the *structure* of the scenario leads to **8:45 am** as the only logical answer.
