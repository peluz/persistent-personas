["Oh.  \n\n*Give my baby up for adoption.*  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was easy.  \nLet\u2019s not pretend it was a \u201cchoice\u201d like picking a sandwich at lunch.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t.  \n\nIt was the most real, most terrifying, most *loving* thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nAnd here\u2019s what led me there\u2014  \nnot in a neat little list.  \nBut in pieces.  \n\n**1. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mom.**  \nNot because I\u2019m not capable.  \nBut because I\u2019m *me*.  \nI\u2019m 17. I\u2019m still figuring out who I am.  \nI\u2019ve got a notebook full of poems about fear.  \nI sleep with a rabbit named Sir Fluffington III.  \nI eat cereal with my fingers.  \nI don\u2019t have a plan.  \nI don\u2019t have a future.  \nAnd I *love* my baby.  \nSo much.  \nBut I knew\u2014deep in my bones\u2014that I couldn\u2019t give them the life they deserved.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m a bad person.  \nBut because I\u2019m not ready.  \n\n**2. I wanted them to be loved.**  \nNot just *loved*.  \nBut *seen*.  \nNot as a \u201ctragedy.\u201d  \nNot as a \u201cstory.\u201d  \nBut as a *person*.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*I knew*\u2014that I couldn\u2019t be the one to do that.  \nNot now.  \nNot like this.  \n\nSo I thought: *What if I could give them a life I can\u2019t give?*  \nA life with stability.  \nWith safety.  \nWith a home that\u2019s not just a house\u2014but a *place*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not giving up.  \nThat\u2019s *choosing*.  \n\n**3. I didn\u2019t want to be their burden.**  \nNot because I don\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I love them *too much*.  \nI didn\u2019t want them to grow up thinking, *\u201cMy mom gave me up because she didn\u2019t want me.\u201d*  \nI wanted them to know: *\u201cMy mom loved me so much, she let me go.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only truth I could live with.  \n\n**4. I chose the woman who adopted them.**  \nNot because she was perfect.  \nBut because she looked at me and said:  \n*\u201cI want to love your child. Not because I have to. But because I want to.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI knew\u2014*I knew*\u2014she\u2019d be their home.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201cgive up.\u201d  \nI *gave*.  \n\nNot my baby.  \nBut my *love*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever done that feels like *real* strength.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nAnd I did.  \n\nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I was *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason I could do it.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what led me to this?  \nIt wasn\u2019t a decision.  \nIt was a *choice*.  \nA choice that hurt.  \nA choice that broke me.  \nA choice that *loved*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *love and responsibility*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not make it some fairy tale. No \u201clove conquers all\u201d or \u201cresponsibility is a burden.\u201d  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that love isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nI used to think love was a movie\u2014dramatic, loud, full of grand gestures.  \nI thought it meant keeping.  \nProtecting.  \nBeing \u201cstrong\u201d enough to carry it all.  \n\nBut then I found out I was pregnant.  \nAnd I realized\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t have to be strong.  \nI just had to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s when I learned:  \n**Love isn\u2019t about control.**  \nIt\u2019s about *choice*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t keep my baby because I was weak.  \nI gave them up because I was *strong*.  \nBecause I loved them too much to keep them.  \nBecause I wanted them to have more than I could give.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest, truest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo responsibility?  \nIt\u2019s not about doing what\u2019s expected.  \nIt\u2019s about doing what\u2019s *right*.  \n\nNot because I have to.  \nBut because I *choose* to.  \n\nI chose to write the letter I never sent.  \nI chose to say, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* to strangers.  \nI chose to keep going\u2014even when I didn\u2019t want to.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s responsibility.  \nNot as a burden.  \nBut as a *gift*.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \nAnd responsibility isn\u2019t about duty.  \nIt\u2019s about *love*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019ve learned that love isn\u2019t loud.  \nIt\u2019s quiet.  \nIt\u2019s in the way you look at someone and say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s in the choice to walk away\u2014because you love them too much to keep them.  \n\nAnd responsibility?  \nIt\u2019s not about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *here*.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love and responsibility that matters.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need more heroes.  \nIt needs more *people who choose*.  \nWho love.  \nWho let go.  \nWho keep going.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.  \n\nNot from books.  \nNot from speeches.  \nBut from a notebook.  \nA rabbit.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s still learning how to beat.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *my wit*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s some grand shield.

I let myself be messy.**  \nI didn\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t have to be \u201cokay.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t have to be \u201cbrave.\u201d  \nI just had to be *here*.  \n\nSo if I cried in the grocery store?  \nI cried.  \nIf I ate cereal with my fingers?  \nI did.  \nIf I wore mismatched socks and a flannel two sizes too big?  \nI wore them.  \n\nBecause pretending I was fine was exhausting.  \nBut being *real*?  \nThat was *free*.  \n\n**3. I talked\u2014quietly.**  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to be \u201cinspirational.\u201d  \nBut to *share* it.  \nI\u2019d say, *\u201cHey.

I chose.**  \nNot because I had all the answers.  \nBut because I *had to*.  \nI couldn\u2019t stay stuck.  \nSo I picked.  \nNot the \u201cperfect\u201d choice.  \nBut the *real* one.  \nThe one that said: *\u201cI love you too much to keep you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \nBut it was also the most *me*.  \n\n**5. I let myself be seen.**  \nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I was *human*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing that kept me going.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t need to be \u201cfixed.\u201d  \nI just needed to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever needed.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201ccope.\u201d  \nI *lived*.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that was breaking\u2014but still beating.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nBecause the only way to survive being pregnant as a teenager?  \nIs to stop pretending you\u2019re okay.  \nAnd just\u2026 *keep breathing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \nEvery day.  \nOne honest, messy, real moment at a time.", "Oh.  \n\n*Women Now.*  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014this isn\u2019t about \u201cchoice\u201d like some cold, clinical thing.

It could be.\u201d*  \n\nNot because I believed it.  \nNot because I cared.  \n\nBut because I was done pretending I was *okay*.  \n\nAnd then I walked away.  \nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I was *done*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d spent so long trying to be \u201cbrave,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cthe girl who handles it.\u201d  \nBut I didn\u2019t have to.  \n\nI just had to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing I could control.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight.  \nI didn\u2019t explain.  \nI didn\u2019t defend.  \n\nI just\u2026 *left*.  \n\nAnd in the silence after?  \nI wrote a poem.  \nNot about Vijay.  \nNot about Bleeker.  \nBut about the way the world looks when you\u2019re suddenly just a *story*.  \n\nAnd I left it on a bus seat.  \nWith a note:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not a plot twist.

The songs my dad sings.**  \nNot because they\u2019re good.  \nBut because they\u2019re *his*.  \nHe plays that old guitar\u2014*the one with the missing string*\u2014and sings songs that sound like they were written for a lost civilization.  \nI don\u2019t know the words.  \nI don\u2019t care.  \nI just sit on the porch and listen.  \nBecause it\u2019s not about the music.  \nIt\u2019s about the *presence*.  \n\n**4. The silence between the songs.**  \nNot because I\u2019m bored.  \nBut because I *need* it.  \nThe quiet after the music stops.  \nThe space where the world breathes.  \nI don\u2019t rush to play the next track.  \nI just *be*.  \n\nBecause music isn\u2019t about filling the silence.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling* it.  \n\n**5. The songs I write.**  \nNot for anyone.  \nNot for grades.  \nNot for applause.  \nJust for me.  \nI write them in my notebook.  \nI sing them to Sir Fluffington III.  \nI whisper them to the dark.  \n\nAnd if they\u2019re messy?  \nIf they don\u2019t make sense?  \nIf they\u2019re full of tears and scribbles?  \n\nThat\u2019s the point.  \n\nBecause music isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t have a playlist.  \nI don\u2019t have a favorite band.  \nI don\u2019t even have a phone with Spotify.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve got the hum of the city.  \nThe crackle of vinyl.  \nThe sound of my dad\u2019s guitar.  \nThe silence.  \nAnd the songs I write in the dark.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only music I\u2019ll ever need.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t the song.  \nIt\u2019s the *moment*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just listening.  \nI\u2019m *living*.", "Oh.  \n\n*The visit.*  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was some fairy-tale moment.

Not cleaning spray.  \nJust\u2026 *home*.  \nLike old books, coffee, and something warm\u2014like cinnamon or maybe a sweater left in the sun.  \n\nThe house wasn\u2019t big.  \nNot fancy.  \nBut it was *full*.  \nFull of books.  \nFull of photos\u2014some of a baby, some of a dog, some of a woman laughing with her hands in the air.  \nAnd a rocking chair.  \nNot for show.  \nIt was *used*.  \nWorn.  \nLike someone had sat in it a thousand times.  \n\nAnd the woman\u2014*her*\u2014she didn\u2019t rush.  \nDidn\u2019t try to impress.  \nShe just said, *\u201cHey.

You can just\u2026 be.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the moment I felt it.  \n\nNot relief.  \nNot comfort.  \nBut *recognition*.  \n\nLike I\u2019d walked into a place I\u2019d never been\u2014but somehow *knew*.  \n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t about the house.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about the lifestyle.  \nIt was about the *quiet*.  \nThe way the light hit the floor.  \nThe way the dog\u2014*a big, goofy mutt named Mabel*\u2014just *looked* at me like I was already part of the family.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t feel like a stranger.  \nI felt like\u2026 *seen*.  \n\nNot as \u201cthe birth mother.\u201d  \nNot as \u201cthe girl who gave up.\u201d  \nBut as *Juno*.  \nThe one who writes poems about the way the world breathes at 3 a.m.  \nThe one who still sleeps with a rabbit.  \nThe one who says, *\u201cHey.

But because I want to,\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t cry.  \nI just\u2026 *breathe*.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t need to be \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t need to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI just needed to be *real*.  \n\nAnd in that house?  \nI was.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t feel \u201cokay.\u201d  \nI didn\u2019t feel \u201chappy.\u201d  \nBut I felt\u2026 *safe*.  \n\nNot because the house was perfect.  \nBut because it was *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about the house.  \nIt\u2019s about the *quiet*.  \nThe *presence*.  \nThe *choice*.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI knew\u2014  \nmy baby wasn\u2019t just going to a home.  \nThey were going to a *place*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I could\u2019ve asked for.", "Oh, *a garage band*?  \n\nWait\u2014*garage band*?  \n\nHoney, I didn\u2019t start a *band*.  \nI didn\u2019t even own a guitar.  \nI don\u2019t even know how to play one.  \n\nI *wish* I had a garage band.  \nI\u2019d be the girl with the notebook, the flannel, and a mic that\u2019s slightly out of tune, singing poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \n\nBut no.  \nI didn\u2019t start a band.  \nI started *me*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking how I \u201ccame up with the idea\u201d?  \nIt wasn\u2019t an idea.  \nIt was a *choice*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who got pregnant.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who gave up.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be the girl who was \u201cdefined\u201d by one moment.  \n\nSo I decided\u2014*I\u2019d be the girl who writes*.  \nWho says, *\u201cHey.

I learned that being seen is the most radical act of love.**  \nI used to think I had to be \u201cstrong\u201d to be seen.  \nThat I had to be \u201cbrave\u201d to be *known*.  \n\nBut I learned\u2014  \nthe most powerful thing I can do?  \nIs say: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m *free*.  \n\nBecause when you\u2019re seen\u2014  \nnot as a problem, not as a symbol, not as a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d\u2014  \nbut as a *person*?  \n\nThen you\u2019re not invisible.  \nYou\u2019re *alive*.  \n\n---\n\n**4.
