Conversely, excessive security can infringe upon freedom. The compatibility lies in finding the optimal balance where security provides the framework for freedom to flourish, rather than suppress it.\n\n*   **Justice (Party A) with Order (Party B):**\n    *   **Compatibility:** Justice, in its application, often relies on established order. A system of justice requires rules, procedures, and a predictable framework (order) to be administered fairly and consistently. Without order, justice can devolve into arbitrary decisions or chaos. Order provides the structure through which justice can be sought and maintained.\n\n*   **Equality (Party A) with Order (Party B):**\n    *   **Compatibility:** Equality, particularly in terms of equal rights or equal treatment under the law, is often best achieved within a structured and ordered system.
