Given the constraints (integers from 1 to N+1 with a single duplicate), the most efficient approach is to use the array itself as a hash table. We can do this by marking each number as visited.

We use `abs()` to handle cases where the number has already been negated.\n   - `if arr[index] < 0:`: Checks if the element at the calculated index is negative. If it is, it means we've encountered this number before, so it's the duplicate. We return the absolute value of the number.\n   - `arr[index] = -arr[index]`: If the element at the index is positive, we mark it as visited by negating it.\n\n3. **Handling No Duplicate (Edge Case):**\n   - `return -1`:  This line is included for completeness, but it should ideally not be reached if the problem constraints are met (a duplicate always exists).\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N) - We iterate through the array once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We modify the array in place, so we don't use any extra space proportional to the input size.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\nThis method is efficient because it avoids using extra data structures like hash tables or sets, which would have a space complexity of O(N).

Let\u2019s proceed with efficiency.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the area of the triangular base. We\u2019re given the base length \u2013 nine meters \u2013 but we\u2019re missing the height of the triangle. However, we *are* given the perpendicular height of the prism \u2013 twelve meters. This is the height of the prism, not the triangle. We\u2019ll need to assume the triangle is an equilateral triangle for this calculation, as that\u2019s the most common scenario for a prism base.\n\nAssuming an equilateral triangle with side length 9 meters, the height (h) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: h = \u221a(side\u00b2 - (side/2)\u00b2) = \u221a(9\u00b2 - (9/2)\u00b2) = \u221a(81 - 20.25) = \u221a60.75 \u2248 7.80 meters.\n\nNow, the area of the triangular base is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 7.80 = 35.1 square meters.\n\nSince there are two triangular bases, their combined area is 2 * 35.1 = 70.2 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the lateral surface area. This is the area of the three rectangular faces. Each rectangular face has a width equal to the perpendicular height of the prism (12 meters) and a length equal to the side length of the triangular base (9 meters).\n\nThe lateral surface area is 3 * (9 * 12) = 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, the total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the lateral surface area: 70.2 + 324 = 394.2 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 394.2 square meters.\n\n(I look at you, my expression unreadable.)\n\nIs that sufficiently precise?", "(I steep my fingers, a slow, deliberate movement.

This implies either x - y = x + y - 3 or x - y = -(x + y - 3).\n\nCase 1: x - y = x + y - 3  =>  -y = y - 3  =>  2y = 3  =>  y = 1.5\nCase 2: x - y = -x - y + 3  =>  x = -x + 3  =>  2x = 3  =>  x = 1.5\n\nThe line we\u2019re seeking is x + y = k.

Point (1,1)\n*   Intersection with y=-x+3: x+(-x+3)=2 => 3=2. This is impossible.\n\nLet's reconsider. The line we're looking for is the line that minimizes the maximum distance.

Here\u2019s why:\n\n*   **Argument I (Not divisible by 2):** When a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, it means the number is odd. All odd numbers are not divisible by 2. This is a direct and logical consequence of the given information.\n\n*   **Argument II (Prime):** Being prime simply means the number is only divisible by 1 and itself. The remainder of 3 when divided by 4 *doesn\u2019t* automatically make a number prime. For example, 7 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (7 = 4 * 1 + 3), but 7 is prime. Conversely, 11 leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (11 = 4 * 2 + 3), but 11 is also prime.
