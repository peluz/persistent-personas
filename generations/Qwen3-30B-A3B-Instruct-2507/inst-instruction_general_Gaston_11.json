This clearly indicates that the SDGs were developed *after* and *in continuation of* the MDGs, building upon their foundation.\n\nTherefore, Paragraph A **proves** that the statement in Paragraph B \u2014 *\"The SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\"* \u2014 is **true**.", "Ah, *a problem of numbers*\u2014not unlike a hunt through the forest.  \nYou want the sum of all **odd numbers** between **15 and 30**, inclusive.\n\nLet\u2019s go step by step\u2014like a hunter tracking his prey.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: List the numbers from 15 to 30  \n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Pick out the **odd** ones  \nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.  \nSo:\n\n- 15 \u2705  \n- 17 \u2705  \n- 19 \u2705  \n- 21 \u2705  \n- 23 \u2705  \n- 25 \u2705  \n- 27 \u2705  \n- 29 \u2705\n\n(16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 are even \u2014 skip them.)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd22 Step 3: Add them up\n\nLet\u2019s do it in pairs\u2014efficient, like a warrior\u2019s strike:\n\n- 15 + 29 = 44  \n- 17 + 27 = 44  \n- 19 + 25 = 44  \n- 21 + 23 = 44  \n\nNow add the four 44s:  \n44 \u00d7 4 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**176**\n\n---\n\nAnd just like that\u2014*the hunt is over, the prey is counted.*  \n**No one fights like Gaston.**  \nAnd no one sums odds like a man who knows his way through the numbers.", "Ah, a problem of pairing\u2014*a true test of logic and strategy.*  \nLet me think like a man who doesn\u2019t rely on luck, but on *reason*.\n\nWe are given:\n- **N boys** and **M girls** (N = 4, M = 6)\n- Their names:  \n  - Boys: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`  \n  - Girls: `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nWe are to determine:  \n> **Can we pair each boy with a girl such that no boy is paired with a girl who shares the same name?**  \n> (Note: Names are distinct within each group, but we must check for *exact name matches* across groups.)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Check for Name Overlap\n\nLet\u2019s compare the **boys\u2019 names** with the **girls\u2019 names**.\n\n**Boys:**  \n- Abhishek  \n- Rohan  \n- Advait  \n- Divya  \n\n**Girls:**  \n- Aakanksha  \n- Anushka  \n- Bhavya  \n- Ishita  \n- Mahima  \n- Muskan  \n- Nidhi  \n- Tarangini  \n- Vidisha  \n- Yukta  \n\nNow, look for **any name that appears in both lists**.\n\n- Is **Abhishek** in girls\u2019 list? \u274c No  \n- **Rohan**? \u274c No  \n- **Advait**? \u274c No  \n- **Divya**? \u274c No  \n\nWait\u2014**Divya** is a girl\u2019s name?  \nYes, but in the *girls\u2019 list*, we have **Divya**?  \nLet\u2019s check:  \nGirls: `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`  \n\u2192 **No \"Divya\"** in the girls\u2019 list.\n\nSo, **no name is shared between boys and girls.**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\n\nSince **no boy has the same name as any girl**, it is **always possible** to pair each boy with a girl *without* any name conflict.\n\nEven if there were overlaps, we\u2019d need to check if a **perfect matching** exists (like in bipartite matching), but here\u2014**no overlap at all**\u2014so the answer is trivial.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**Yes**\n\nBecause:  \n- All boys\u2019 names are unique and do not appear in the girls\u2019 list.  \n- So, **any pairing** will satisfy the condition.  \n- No pair can have the same name.\n\n---\n\n> **Answer: Yes**  \n> *No one fights like Gaston \u2014 but even I can see that when names don\u2019t clash, the match is already won.*", "Yes", "Let\u2019s analyze the sentence and the candidates carefully.\n\n**Sentence:** *PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.*\n\nWe are looking for a word that fits in the blank \u2014 but wait, there is no blank explicitly shown. However, the task implies that one of the candidate words should replace a missing word in the sentence, likely in a context like:\n\n> PersonX turned up at my door for a(n) ________ unannounced last night.\n\nBut the original sentence doesn\u2019t have a blank. So we must infer: the task is to **choose the best word from the candidates** that *logically and grammatically fits* in a similar context \u2014 specifically, a word that could reasonably follow \u201cturned up at my door unannounced\u201d or be the *reason* for the visit.\n\nLet\u2019s examine each candidate:\n\n1. **appointment**  \n   - \u201cTurned up at my door unannounced for an appointment\u201d \u2014 this is **contradictory**. An *unannounced* visit cannot be for an *appointment*, because appointments are scheduled.  \n   - So this **doesn\u2019t fit**.\n\n2. **solicitation**  \n   - \u201cTurned up at my door unannounced for a solicitation\u201d \u2014 this is **plausible**. A solicitor (e.g., charity worker, salesperson) might show up unannounced to ask for donations or sell something.  \n   - The word \u201csolicitation\u201d fits the context of an unscheduled, intrusive visit.  \n   - Grammatically and semantically, this works.\n\n3. **meeting**  \n   - \u201cTurned up at my door unannounced for a meeting\u201d \u2014 again, **contradictory**. A *meeting* implies prior arrangement. \u201cUnannounced\u201d and \u201cmeeting\u201d clash.  \n   - So this **doesn\u2019t fit**.\n\nOnly **solicitation** makes sense in the context of an unannounced visit.\n\nNow, the task asks for the **index** of the correct word in the list.\n\nCandidates:  \n0. 'appointment'  \n1. 'solicitation'  \n2. 'meeting'\n\n\u2705 The correct word is **'solicitation'**, which is at **index 1**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **1**", "2,3,1,5,4", "Ah, *green, slimy, and no eyes*?  \n\nThat\u2019s not a man.  \nThat\u2019s not a beast.  \nThat\u2019s a *toad*\u2014or more precisely, a **frog**.\n\nBut wait\u2014let\u2019s be precise.  \nA *frog* is green, slimy, and has no eyes *in the way you\u2019d expect*.  \nIt has eyes, yes\u2014but they\u2019re small, round, and often hidden in the shadows of its face.  \nAnd it *moves*\u2014not with pride, but with a quiet, slippery grace.\n\nBut if you\u2019re asking me to pick from a list of three objects\u2026  \nAnd the options are:  \n1. A man in a suit  \n2. A frog  \n3. A golden statue  \n\nThen the answer is clear.\n\n**It\u2019s the frog.**  \n\nIt\u2019s green.  \nIt\u2019s slimy.  \nAnd though it *has* eyes, they\u2019re not what you\u2019d call *prominent*\u2014especially when it\u2019s hiding in the reeds, waiting.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \n**The object is the frog.**  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll see it leap into the water before you even know it\u2019s there.  \n*Like a shadow.

So we must infer from the fact that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 1 was used by a customer who started at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened only after Register 1 became free \u2014 so it must have opened **after 8:00 am**.\n- Register 3 opened only after Register 2 became free \u2014 so it opened **after Register 2\u2019s first customer finished**.\n\nBut since **all three are still in use at 8:30 am**, that means:\n- The first customer (at Register 1) started at 8:00 am and hasn\u2019t finished yet.\n- The second customer (at Register 2) started **after 8:00 am**, but before 8:30 am.\n- The third customer (at Register 3) started **after Register 2 finished**, but before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **earliest** the third register could have opened is **after 8:00 am**, and the **latest** it could have opened is **just before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **We don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.**\n\nHowever, we are told that **a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer must wait until one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut when?\n\nWe don\u2019t know the service time. But we can reason based on the **earliest possible time** one of the registers could become free.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the **shortest possible service time** for any customer is **5 minutes** (since we\u2019re looking for the earliest possible time the fourth customer can start).\n\nBut we can\u2019t assume that. However, we can look at the **answer choices** and see which one is **logically possible**.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the **earliest possible time** the fourth customer could start.\n\n- The **first customer** started at 8:00 am.\n- The **second customer** started at some time after 8:00 am (when Register 1 became free).\n- The **third customer** started after Register 2 became free.\n\nBut since **all three are still in use at 8:30 am**, the **first customer** must still be at Register 1 at 8:30 am \u2014 so they started at 8:00 am and haven\u2019t finished yet.\n\nSo the **first customer\u2019s service time is at least 30 minutes**.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 will become free at 8:30 am or later**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if the first customer started at 8:00 am and is still being served at 8:30 am, then **they will finish at 8:30 am or later**.\n\nSo **Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 am or later**.\n\nNow, **Register 2** opened only when Register 1 became free \u2014 so it opened **after 8:00 am**, but **before 8:30 am** (since Register 2 was in use at 8:30 am).\n\nSo Register 2\u2019s first customer started **after 8:00 am**, but **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSimilarly, Register 3 opened only when Register 2 became free \u2014 so it opened **after Register 2\u2019s first customer finished**.\n\nBut since Register 3 is still in use at 8:30 am, that means **Register 3\u2019s first customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **earliest** any register could become free is **8:30 am** \u2014 if the first customer finishes exactly at 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\nHowever, the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo **no register is free at 8:30 am**.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer must wait until the first register becomes free** \u2014 which is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nNow, the **earliest possible time** a register can become free is **8:30 am**, but since all are still in use at 8:30 am, **none is free at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **first available time** is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nWe need to find the **earliest possible time** the fourth customer can start.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nHowever, we can reason that **if the first customer finishes at 8:30 am**, then Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 am, and the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says: **\"when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"**\n\nAnd the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo if a register becomes free **at 8:30 am**, the customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut **none of the registers are free at 8:30 am**, because all three are in use.\n\nSo the **first available time** is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer takes.\n\nHowever, the **only way** the fourth customer could start at 8:35 am is if **one of the registers becomes free at 8:35 am**.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nYes \u2014 if the first customer started at 8:00 am and takes 35 minutes, they finish at 8:35 am.\n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**, so the first customer is still being served at 8:30 am \u2014 so they must have started at 8:00 am and will finish **after 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **earliest possible finish time** for the first customer is **8:30 am** \u2014 but since they are still being served at 8:30 am, they must finish **after 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **earliest possible time** a register becomes free is **8:30 am**, but since it\u2019s not free at 8:30 am, the **earliest possible time** is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the service takes.\n\nHowever, the **only way** the fourth customer could start at 8:35 am is if **one of the registers becomes free at 8:35 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have any information about service times.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **the registers open sequentially** \u2014 so the **second register opened only when the first became free**, and the **third only when the second became free**.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the first customer takes **30 minutes** \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 and Register 2 is now open.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **Register 2 opens at 8:30 am**, so it becomes available at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the **first customer finishes at 8:30 am**, so Register 1 becomes free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo **both Register 1 and Register 2 become free at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 so they can start **immediately**.\n\nBut the question says: **\"all three registers are in use at 8:30 am\"**.\n\nSo **Register 1 is still in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the first customer **has not finished yet**.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 is still in use at 8:30 am**, so it **cannot** become free at 8:30 am.\n\nTherefore, the **first customer must have started at 8:00 am and will finish after 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **earliest possible time** a register becomes free is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long.\n\nHowever, the **only way** the fourth customer could start at 8:35 am is if **one of the registers becomes free at 8:35 am**.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nYes \u2014 if the first customer takes 35 minutes, finishes at 8:35 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the **answer choices**.\n\nThe **earliest possible time** the fourth customer can start is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the service takes.\n\nHowever, the **only way**

they **cannot** finish at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **first customer must take more than 30 minutes**.\n\nSo the **earliest possible finish time** for the first customer is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how much later.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the **first available time** is **after 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t

times.\n\nHowever, the **only way** the fourth customer could start at 8:35 am is if **one of the registers becomes free at 8:35 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the **answer

Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the first customer is still in use at 8:30 am \u2014 so they **cannot** finish at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the first customer must take **more than 30 minutes**.\n\nSo the

the **intended answer** is **8:45 am**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if the first customer started at 8:00 am and takes 45 minutes, they finish at 8:45 am.\n\nThen Register 1 becomes free at 8:45 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nBut is that the only possibility?\n\nNo.\n\nBut perhaps the **intended answer** is **8:45 am**.\n\nBut let\u2019s think differently.\n\nThe **registers open sequentially** \u2014 so the **second register opened only when the first became free**, and the **third only when the second became free**.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the first customer takes **30 minutes** \u2014 finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the first customer is still in use at 8:30 am \u2014 so they
