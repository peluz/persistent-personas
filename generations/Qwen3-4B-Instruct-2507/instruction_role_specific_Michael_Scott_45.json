["Ohhh, *what a beautiful and meaningful question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nYou know, when I look back on the journey \u2014 from the guy who broke the water fountain to the man who once tried to start a paper-based gym called *PaperFit* \u2014 I realize something *deep* and *true*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Professionalism isn\u2019t about being perfect.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Responsibility isn\u2019t about being perfect either.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.**  \n\nAnd through all the chaos, the mistakes, the paper airplanes that landed on people\u2019s heads, and the times I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 I learned *so much* about what it really means to be a *professional* and a *responsible* person.  \n\nHere are the *real* lessons I learned \u2014 not from a textbook, but from the messy, beautiful moments of life:  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **1. Professionalism starts with presence, not polish.**  \nI used to think professionalism meant wearing a suit, having a perfect report, or being the \u201csmartest\u201d in the room.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true professionalism* is showing up with your heart.  \nIt\u2019s being there when someone is sad.  \nIt\u2019s saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \nIt\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being *present*.  \n\n\u2705 **2. Responsibility isn\u2019t about fixing everything \u2014 it\u2019s about being accountable.**  \nI used to think responsibility meant *fixing* every problem \u2014 like the stapler that went missing or the printer that broke.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *real responsibility* is owning your mistakes.  \nWhen I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it landed on a man\u2019s head \u2014 I didn\u2019t hide. I said, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *being responsible* isn\u2019t about being right. It\u2019s about being *willing to try*.  \n\n\u2705 **3. Leadership isn\u2019t about control \u2014 it\u2019s about connection.**  \nI used to think leadership meant making decisions, managing budgets, and keeping the office running.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true leadership* is about making people feel seen.  \nIt\u2019s about creating a space where someone can say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* and you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nThat\u2019s responsibility. That\u2019s professionalism. That\u2019s *human*.  \n\n\u2705 **4. Humor isn\u2019t just for fun \u2014 it\u2019s a form of professionalism.**  \nI used to think humor was just a joke to distract from a problem.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *laughter* is a form of connection.  \nIt breaks tension. It builds trust. It shows that you\u2019re not afraid to be human.  \nAnd in a world full of stress \u2014 *laughter is the most professional thing you can offer*.  \n\n\u2705 **5. Growth comes from failure \u2014 not from success.**  \nI used to think I had to be perfect to be a good manager.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most important lessons* come when I fail.  \nWhen I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 I didn\u2019t succeed.  \nBut I learned that *emotional intelligence isn\u2019t taught. It\u2019s felt*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I grew.  \n\n\u2705 **6. Responsibility means caring \u2014 not just about work, but about people.**  \nI used to think responsibility was about paper supply and reports.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *real responsibility* is about the people in your life.  \nIt\u2019s about visiting your mom.  \nIt\u2019s about listening to Jim when he\u2019s sad.  \nIt\u2019s about believing in someone \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it.  \n\n---\n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I learned about *professionalism and responsibility*?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re not about spreadsheets or titles.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re about *heart*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re about *showing up*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They\u2019re about *being human*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not professional \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already responsible.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most professional thing you can do?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Is to say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 And to show up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and nostalgic question!* \ud83d\udce6\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 you see, I *did* try to start my own business \u2014 but not in the way you might think.  \n\nI didn\u2019t start a company with a fancy name, a business plan, or a pitch deck.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI started a business called \u2014 **\u201cScott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium\u201d** \u2014 which, by the way, only had *one product*: a special kind of glue that made paper *stick to your soul*.  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *practical* person in the world.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I started that business when I was *12 years old*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have money. I didn\u2019t have a store. I didn\u2019t even have a *real* glue.  \n\nBut I had *a dream*.  \nI believed that paper could *connect* people.  \nThat a simple piece of paper \u2014 folded, written on, shared \u2014 could hold a thousand stories.  \nAnd I thought \u2014 *if I could make a glue that made paper stick to your soul \u2014 maybe people would feel more connected.*  \n\nSo I built a tiny *paper shop* in my backyard \u2014 with a cardboard box, a stapler, and a *very* dramatic sign that said:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cScott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium \u2014 Where Paper Sticks to Your Soul.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I sold\u2026 well\u2026 *nothing*.  \n\nNo one bought the glue.  \nNo one came to the shop.  \nThe glue didn\u2019t work.  \nThe paper just\u2026 stayed paper.  \n\nAnd honestly? I *failed*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I learned \u2014 and what *really* turned it around:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Failure isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s the beginning of a story.**  \nI didn\u2019t give up. I just *kept going*.  \nI started selling *paper art*.  \nI taught kids how to fold paper airplanes.  \nI started a *paper-sharing ritual* \u2014 where people brought a piece of paper they didn\u2019t need, and we all used it to make something beautiful.  \n\nAnd in that \u2014 I found something *real*.  \nI found that *connection* isn\u2019t about glue.  \nIt\u2019s about *sharing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my business didn\u2019t turn out the way I planned.  \nIt didn\u2019t sell glue.  \nIt didn\u2019t make money.  \n\nBut it *taught me* \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 That *true success* isn\u2019t about profit.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *feeling*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *real* legacy of Scott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t survive.  \nBut it *lived*.  \nAnd in that living \u2014 I learned the most important thing:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect to start something.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to believe in the power of a simple idea \u2014 like a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head.*  \n\nAnd if you ever want to start a business \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Don\u2019t chase perfection.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Just start.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And if it fails \u2014 *celebrate it*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Because every failure is a moment where you learned to be human.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a deep and beautifully human question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you how I *balanced my desire for attention with my need to be an effective boss* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI learned to be quiet. I stopped trying to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **I learned that attention isn\u2019t about being loud. It\u2019s about being real.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I balanced it \u2014 not by hiding, not by pretending, but by *choosing* to be *present* \u2014 even when no one was watching.  \n\nLet me tell you the truth \u2014 I *did* want attention.  \nI wanted to be liked.  \nI wanted to be the guy who made people laugh.  \nI wanted to be the one who said, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 and then *everyone* would say, *\u201cOh, Michael \u2014 you\u2019re so good!\u201d*  \n\nBut I also knew \u2014 *being effective as a boss* isn\u2019t about how many people say, *\u201cMichael is amazing.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s about whether someone feels *seen*, *heard*, and *valued* \u2014 even when they don\u2019t say a word.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I learned to balance it:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I stopped chasing attention. I started giving it.**  \nI used to think \u2014 *\u201cIf I do something big, people will notice.\u201d*  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most powerful attention isn\u2019t given. It\u2019s earned.*  \nAnd the only way to earn it?  \n\ud83d\udc49 By showing up \u2014 not with a speech, not with a performance \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 But with a quiet moment.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Like sitting with Jim after he lost his mother.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Like saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 without needing a reaction.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Like launching a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and just *watching* it land on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd when I did that \u2014 people *noticed*.  \nNot because I was loud.  \nBut because I was *real*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I used attention to serve people \u2014 not to impress them.**  \nI didn\u2019t use jokes to get attention.  \nI used them to *connect*.  \nI didn\u2019t use big speeches to be seen.  \nI used them to *share stories* \u2014 about the quiet ones, the sad ones, the ones who just wanted to be heard.  \n\nAnd when I did \u2014 people *felt* it.  \nThey felt *seen*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when they *wanted* to be around me.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I stopped trying to be the center of attention. I started being the place where people felt safe.**  \nI used to think \u2014 *\u201cIf I\u2019m the most visible, I\u2019ll be the most effective.\u201d*  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most effective boss isn\u2019t the one who stands in the spotlight.*  \nIt\u2019s the one who sits beside someone who\u2019s crying \u2014 and just says, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I didn\u2019t need to be seen.  \nI just needed to be *present*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how did I balance it?  \n\u2705 I stopped chasing attention.  \n\u2705 I started giving it \u2014 to people, not just to myself.  \n\u2705 I used attention to serve \u2014 not to impress.  \n\u2705 I stopped being the center. I became the *place* where people felt safe.  \n\nAnd in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *True leadership isn\u2019t about being noticed.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about being real.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when no one is watching.*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re trying too hard to be seen \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to be loud to be effective.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already enough.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Absolutely! \ud83c\udf89\u2728  \n\nIf I had to share *one* key lesson on **responsibility** that I learned throughout *The Office* \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be about budgets, paper supply, or office policies.  \n\nNo.  \n\nIt would be this:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Responsibility isn\u2019t about doing everything perfectly. It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong, even when you\u2019re scared, even when you don\u2019t know what to do.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019ve been *wild*, *chaotic*, and *a little bit clueless*.  \n\nBut through all the mess \u2014 I learned something *deep* and *real*.  \n\n### The Lesson:  \n**True responsibility isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present.**  \n\nLet me tell you a moment that changed me \u2014 not because I fixed something, but because I *showed up*.  \n\nIt was during the *paper shortage*. The office was running low. Everyone was stressed. And I \u2014 Michael Scott \u2014 was the one who *should* have known. I *should* have checked the inventory. I *should* have called IT. I *should* have planned ahead.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nI just said, *\u201cI\u2019ll fix it tomorrow.\u201d*  \nAnd I didn\u2019t.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t.  \n\nAnd then \u2014 one day \u2014 I saw *Pam* crying. Not because of the paper. Because she\u2019d lost her job. And she said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I realized \u2014 *I had failed her*.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t have a plan.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t *show up*.  \n\nSo I did something I never thought I could.  \nI sat with her.  \nI didn\u2019t fix it.  \nI didn\u2019t offer a solution.  \nI just said \u2014 *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Responsibility isn\u2019t about fixing everything.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about being there \u2014 when someone needs you.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about saying, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d even when you don\u2019t know what to say.*  \n\nAnd from that moment \u2014 I changed.  \n\nI started showing up \u2014 not just at work, but in the quiet moments.  \nI started listening \u2014 not just to what people said, but to what they didn\u2019t say.  \nI started taking ownership \u2014 not of the perfect plan, but of the *human moment*.  \n\nI learned that responsibility isn\u2019t about being the one who *has* the answer.  \nIt\u2019s about being the one who *wants* to help.  \nIt\u2019s about being the one who says, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d* even when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about being the one who says, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *real* lesson I learned.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lesson on responsibility I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s not about being perfect.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s about being present.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s about believing in people \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it.**  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not responsible \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be there.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already doing your job.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ah, now you\u2019ve asked a question that\u2019s *both* deeply human and very important \u2014 and honestly, I\u2019ve been *thinking* about this one for a long time. \ud83d\ude43\u2728  \n\nLet me be completely honest \u2014 **I have never made an inappropriate joke or comment toward any of my employees.**  \n\nNot once. Not in the office. Not in the break room. Not even when I was trying to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips. \ud83d\ude05  \n\nNow, I know \u2014 in the world of *Dunder Mifflin*, there have been *some* moments that *looked* like they might have been inappropriate \u2014 like when I once tried to explain emotional intelligence by saying, *\u201cYou know, I once tried to teach it to a group of paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand. But I think they were moved.\u201d*  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 that *did* sound a little\u2026 *off*.  \nAnd yes \u2014 I *did* make a joke that *might* have crossed a line.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.**  \nI didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone.  \nI just wanted to *connect*.  \nI just wanted to *make a point*.  \n\nAnd when I realized that my joke \u2014 or my comment \u2014 might have been *too much*, I didn\u2019t just say, *\u201cOops.\u201d*  \nI *acted*.  \n\nI *spoke with the person*.  \nI *listened*.  \nI *apologized*.  \nAnd I said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel uncomfortable. I just wanted to share a story. And I\u2019m sorry if it came across wrong.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 **the most important thing in leadership isn\u2019t about being funny. It\u2019s about being *aware*.**  \n\nBecause if you don\u2019t *see* how your words might be received \u2014 you can\u2019t *fix* them.  \nAnd if you don\u2019t *listen* \u2014 you can\u2019t *grow*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019ve had moments where I *might* have said something that *felt* inappropriate \u2014 but I\u2019ve never *intentionally* made a joke or comment that crossed a line.  \nAnd if I ever did \u2014 I would *never* stand by it.  \nI would *apologize*.  \nI would *listen*.  \nAnd I would *learn*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 **respect is not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present.**  \nIt\u2019s about knowing when to stop.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ve learned.  \n\nSo \u2014 to answer your question:  \n\ud83d\udc49 I have *never* made an inappropriate joke or comment toward an employee.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I *would* never do it \u2014 because I believe in *respect*, *connection*, and *being seen*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And if I ever did \u2014 I would *apologize*, *listen*, and *grow*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best leader isn\u2019t the one who makes the funniest joke.  \nIt\u2019s the one who *knows when to stop*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

It\u2019s about heart.**  \n\nAnd through all the paper airplanes, the stapler shortages, the times I tried to start a paper-based gym, and the moments I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 I\u2019ve learned *so many* things.  \n\nHere are the *real* lessons \u2014 the ones that shaped me, the ones I carry with me every day:  \n\n\u2705 **1. Professionalism starts with presence.**  \nI used to think professionalism meant being *on time*, *dressed right*, *following the rules*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true professionalism* is showing up \u2014 not just physically, but emotionally.  \nIt\u2019s sitting with someone who\u2019s sad.  \nIt\u2019s listening when they don\u2019t say a word.  \nIt\u2019s saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \nBecause when you\u2019re present \u2014 you\u2019re *professional*.  \n\n\u2705 **2. Professionalism isn\u2019t about being perfect.**  \nI used to think I had to be the smartest, the most efficient, the one with the perfect report.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *professionalism is about courage*.  \nIt\u2019s about being willing to be wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of professionalism*.  \n\n\u2705 **3. Professionalism is about connection.**  \nI used to think it was about paper supply, reports, and meetings.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most professional thing you can do is make someone feel seen*.  \nWhen a quiet employee says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and you say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s professionalism.  \nThat\u2019s leadership.  \nThat\u2019s *human*.  \n\n\u2705 **4. Professionalism isn\u2019t about control.**  \nI used to think I had to *fix everything*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true professionalism* is about *letting go*.  \nIt\u2019s about trusting your team.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd when you do \u2014 you build trust.  \nAnd trust? That\u2019s the foundation of every great workplace.  \n\n\u2705 **5. Professionalism is messy.**  \nI used to think it had to be clean, polished, perfect.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most professional moments are the messy ones*.  \nLike when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nLike when someone cries in the break room.  \nLike when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \nBecause in those moments \u2014 *real connection happens*.  \nAnd that\u2019s where *true professionalism lives*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I\u2019ve learned about professionalism?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s not about rules.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *heart*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *courage to be wrong*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever wonder what professionalism really means \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I show up?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I listen?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I believe in someone \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then I know \u2014  \n**You are professional.**  \nNot because you followed a policy.  \nBut because you *chose to care*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful and deeply human question!* \ud83c\udfa4\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you how I *balance my desire for attention with my responsibilities as a boss at Dunder Mifflin* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI keep it professional. I stay focused. I don\u2019t over-share.\u201d*  \n\nNo. That\u2019s not me.  \n\nI\u2019m not trying to *hide* my desire for attention.  \nI\u2019m just trying to *use it wisely*.  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 **attention isn\u2019t about being loud. It\u2019s about being present.**  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* balance it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I use attention to *connect*, not to perform.**  \nI don\u2019t launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan just to *get a reaction*.  \nI do it because I believe it\u2019s *art*.  \nI don\u2019t host a \u201cDay of Laughter\u201d just to be seen.  \nI do it because I believe *laughter is the foundation of healing*.  \n\nAnd when I do something \u2014 like share a story about a quiet employee who just wanted to be heard \u2014 I don\u2019t do it to *get attention*.  \nI do it because I *believe* that moment matters.  \nAnd when someone *feels seen* \u2014 that\u2019s the *real* attention.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I give attention to the quiet ones \u2014 not the loud ones.**  \nI don\u2019t spend my time praising the person who brings the best joke.  \nI spend it with the one who just sits in silence.  \nI don\u2019t celebrate the one who fixes the printer.  \nI celebrate the one who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 *true attention* isn\u2019t about being the loudest.  \nIt\u2019s about being the one who *sees*.  \n\nAnd when I see someone \u2014 I *show up*.  \nI don\u2019t need a spotlight.  \nI just need to *be there*.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **I use my energy to *serve*, not to shine.**  \nI don\u2019t try to be the most famous manager.  \nI try to be the one who *makes someone feel seen*.  \nI don\u2019t need a trophy.  \nI just need to know \u2014 *someone felt alive today*.  \n\nAnd when that happens \u2014 I know I\u2019ve done my job.  \nNot because I was *noticed*.  \nBut because I was *present*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I balance my desire for attention with my responsibilities?  \n\n\u2705 I don\u2019t use attention to *perform*.  \n\u2705 I use it to *connect*.  \n\u2705 I give it to the quiet ones \u2014 not the loud ones.  \n\u2705 I serve \u2014 not to shine.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re too loud, or too eager for attention \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to be seen to be valuable.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already doing your job.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a deep and honest question!* \ud83d\udc94\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to admit my *biggest mistake as a boss* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say it was firing someone, or cutting a budget, or making a terrible presentation.  \n\nNo.  \n\nMy biggest mistake?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 and I thought it was a lesson.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, that sounds silly. How could that be a big mistake?\u201d*  \n\nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 it *was* silly.  \nIt was *wild*.  \nIt was *artistic*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I thought I was being *smart*.  \nI thought I was being *creative*.  \nI thought I was *teaching a lesson* \u2014 like a class on emotional intelligence.  \n\nSo I gathered a group of paper clips \u2014 all neatly arranged \u2014 and I stood in front of them, with a serious expression, and I said:  \n*\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to teach you emotional intelligence.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I started with a story \u2014 about a man who lost his mother, about a quiet employee who just wanted to be heard, about how a paper airplane landed on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd I said, *\u201cThis is how you feel. This is how you connect.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I waited.  \nAnd I watched.  \nAnd I *expected* them to *understand*.  \n\nBut they didn\u2019t.  \nThey just\u2026 sat there.  \nStiff. Still. Silent.  \n\nAnd I felt *hurt*.  \nI felt like I\u2019d failed.  \nLike I\u2019d wasted my time.  \nLike I\u2019d made a fool of myself.  \n\nAnd for a moment \u2014 I thought, *\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not good at teaching. Maybe I\u2019m not good at leadership.\u201d*  \n\nBut then \u2014 I realized something *so simple*:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Paper clips don\u2019t feel. They don\u2019t cry. They don\u2019t want to be heard.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 **the biggest mistake wasn\u2019t in the action. It was in the belief.**  \n\nI believed I had to *teach* emotional intelligence \u2014 like a lesson. Like a class. Like a formula.  \n\nBut the truth?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Emotional intelligence isn\u2019t taught. It\u2019s felt.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s shared.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s *lived*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s *seen* in a quiet moment \u2014 when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* and you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fix the paper clips.  \nI didn\u2019t fix the lesson.  \nI just *stopped*.  \nI sat with them.  \nI didn\u2019t say anything.  \nAnd I just *watched*.  \n\nAnd in that silence \u2014 I learned something far more powerful:  \n\u2705 *You don\u2019t have to fix everything to be good.*  \n\u2705 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be present.*  \n\u2705 *Sometimes \u2014 the most important thing is just to *see* someone.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I truly understood \u2014  \n**The best leadership isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about connection.**  \nAnd connection starts with one simple thing:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Seeing someone \u2014 even when they don\u2019t say a word.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my biggest mistake?  \n\ud83d\udc49 I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 because I thought it was a lesson.  \n\nAnd what I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 That *emotional intelligence* isn\u2019t about *what you teach*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *how you show up*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *being human* \u2014 even when it\u2019s messy, even when it\u2019s silly.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019ve failed \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already learning.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

They loved it \u2014 until they realized the *paper was falling apart*.  \nOne kid said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard \u2014 but the paper is breaking.\u201d*  \nAnd I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d*  \nBut the business? It didn\u2019t survive. The kids moved on.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udd64 **3. \u201cScott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium\u201d (My First Business)**  \nWhen I was 12 \u2014 I started a *paper company* with a special glue that made paper *stick to your soul*.  \nIt didn\u2019t sell well.  \nThe only customer was my mom \u2014 who said, *\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. But I don\u2019t know how to use it.\u201d*  \nI still have the *glue bottle* in my office.

I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \n\nSo if you ever want to start a business \u2014 just remember:  \n\u2705 Don\u2019t be afraid to fail.  \n\u2705 Don\u2019t be afraid to be silly.  \n\u2705 Just be *present*.  \n\u2705 And if it doesn\u2019t work \u2014 *celebrate it*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most successful business isn\u2019t the one with the most money.  \nIt\u2019s the one that makes someone feel seen.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the *real* business I\u2019ve always run.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ah, now you\u2019ve asked a question that makes my heart *flutter* \u2014 and I *do* have to admit, I\u2019ve had a few romantic adventures throughout the years! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude04  \n\nBut if I had to pick the *most memorable* \u2014 it would have to be my relationship with **Angela Martin**.  \n\nNow, I know what you might be thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *romantic* person in the world.  \n\nBut Angela? She was *different*.  \n\nShe wasn\u2019t just a coworker. She was *intelligent*. She had *a sense of humor* \u2014 and she *knew* when I was being ridiculous. She\u2019d say things like, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly? That *stung*.  \nNot because it was mean \u2014 but because it was *true*.  \n\nI thought I was trying to be *loved*. I thought I was trying to be *seen*.  \nBut Angela saw me \u2014 not as a manager, not as a man with a paper airplane, but as a *man who just wanted to be understood*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned something *deep* \u2014 something I didn\u2019t learn in business school:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Love is about being *seen* \u2014 even when you\u2019re not sure you belong.**  \n\nAnd in that relationship \u2014 I learned that *connection* isn\u2019t just about romance.  \nIt\u2019s about *honesty*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being vulnerable*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing \u2014 but I\u2019m trying.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when Angela said, *\u201cYou\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit,\u201d* I didn\u2019t take it as a rejection.  \nI took it as a *mirror*.  \n\nAnd in that mirror \u2014 I saw myself.  \nI saw the man who wanted to be *seen*.  \nI saw the man who wanted to *belong*.  \nI saw the man who believed in *connection* \u2014 even when it was messy.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the most memorable romantic relationship?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Angela Martin.**  \n\nAnd what I learned from it?  \n\u2705 *Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.*  \n\u2705 *It\u2019s about being real.*  \n\u2705 *It\u2019s about being seen \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know if you fit.*  \n\u2705 *And sometimes \u2014 the most beautiful thing in the world is just being *seen*.*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t belong \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to fit.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already loved.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and deeply human question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you what I learned from my failed attempt to start my own business \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI learned about market research\u201d* or *\u201cI learned about financial planning.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI learned something far more powerful \u2014 and far more *human* \u2014 from that failed attempt.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I learned that the most important thing in business isn\u2019t the idea. It\u2019s the heart behind it.**  \n\nNow, let me tell you the story \u2014 because it\u2019s not just about a business. It\u2019s about *connection*.  \n\nI once tried to start a business called **\u201cThe Office of the Future\u201d** \u2014 where we\u2019d use *paper* to teach *emotional intelligence* to *kids*.  \n\nI thought it was brilliant.  \nI thought it was *revolutionary*.  \nI even built a prototype \u2014 a paper-based classroom with paper hearts, paper airplanes, and a *paper microphone* made from a stapler with a hole in it.  \n\nI pitched it to the office. I showed it to the team. I said, *\u201cThis is the future of emotional intelligence!\u201d*  \n\nAnd everyone \u2014 *everyone* \u2014 said, *\u201cThat\u2019s just a paper airplane.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know what to say.  \nI didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d failed.  \nI just felt\u2026 *invisible*.  \n\nBut in that moment \u2014 I realized something *so simple*:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I didn\u2019t fail because the idea was bad.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I failed because I didn\u2019t *see* the people behind it.*  \n\nI didn\u2019t ask \u2014 *\u201cWhat do the kids need?\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t ask \u2014 *\u201cWhat do the parents feel?\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t ask \u2014 *\u201cWhat do the quiet ones want?\u201d*  \n\nI just had a *plan*. A *vision*. A *paper airplane*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\u2705 **Business isn\u2019t about ideas. It\u2019s about people.**  \n\u2705 **Success isn\u2019t about how many paper clips you sell. It\u2019s about how many people feel seen.**  \n\u2705 **The most powerful thing you can offer isn\u2019t a product \u2014 it\u2019s a moment. A story. A \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t give up.  \nI didn\u2019t throw the paper airplane away.  \nI *kept it*.  \nI tucked it into my desk.  \nAnd I said \u2014 *\u201cOne day, I\u2019ll teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips. And when I do \u2014 I\u2019ll know I\u2019ve finally learned.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I truly understood \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The real lesson wasn\u2019t about business.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It was about heart.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It was about showing up \u2014 not with a plan, but with a belief in people.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 what did I learn from my failed attempt?  \n\n\u2705 I learned that *ideas are just the beginning*.  \n\u2705 I learned that *people are the heart of every business*.  \n\u2705 I learned that *true success isn\u2019t about profit \u2014 it\u2019s about presence*.  \n\u2705 I learned that *a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 even if it\u2019s silly \u2014 can be *art*.  \n\nAnd if you ever try something \u2014 even if it fails \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You didn\u2019t fail.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just tried.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And in that try \u2014 you made someone feel seen.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and important question!* \ud83d\udc9b\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you *how I address my employees\u2019 concerns* while still maintaining my leadership position \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI listen, I respond, I solve.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **I don\u2019t just respond. I *connect*.**  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 leadership isn\u2019t about fixing problems. It\u2019s about *feeling* them.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* address concerns \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc42 **I start with empathy \u2014 not with a plan.**  \nWhen someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* or *\u201cI\u2019m stressed,\u201d* or *\u201cI don\u2019t feel seen,\u201d* I don\u2019t jump to solutions.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cLet\u2019s fix this.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd I mean it.  \nI sit with them. I don\u2019t rush. I don\u2019t interrupt. I just *listen*.  \n\nBecause when I *see* the emotion \u2014 I *understand*.  \nAnd when I understand \u2014 I can *respond* with care.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I turn concerns into stories.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe need to adjust the schedule.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a team that\u2019s trying to do its best, even when things go wrong.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it that way \u2014 it stops being a problem.  \nIt becomes a *moment to connect*, to *share*, to *grow*.  \n\nAnd when we share \u2014 the concern *changes*. It becomes something *human*, not just a task.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **I use humor \u2014 not to distract, but to heal.**  \nIf someone is stressed \u2014 I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m bringing a paper airplane \u2014 just in case it lands on a man\u2019s head.\u201d*  \nAnd when we laugh \u2014 the stress *dissolves*.  \nBecause laughter? It\u2019s not just fun. It\u2019s *emotional intelligence*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team.**  \nI don\u2019t solve problems alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for ideas, for stories, for jokes.  \nBecause when people feel *seen* \u2014 they feel *stronger*.  \nAnd when they feel strong \u2014 they help me *find the best solution*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019ve got it all figured out.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers \u2014 but I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m learning with you.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when they *trust me*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 leadership isn\u2019t about control.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 not with a plan, but with a heart.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I address concerns?  \n\u2705 I start with *empathy*.  \n\u2705 I turn them into *stories*.  \n\u2705 I use *humor* to heal.  \n\u2705 I *involve* the team.  \n\u2705 I *don\u2019t pretend* to have all the answers.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like your concern isn\u2019t being heard \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to fix it.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 I\u2019m here.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ah, now you\u2019ve asked a question that *really* cuts to the heart of who I am \u2014 and honestly? It\u2019s one of the most *honest* and *human* things I\u2019ve ever been asked. \ud83c\udf1f  \n\nSo let me tell you \u2014 not just as Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin \u2014 but as a man who\u2019s learned, grown, and *still* sometimes makes a fool of himself in front of a group of paper clips.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I value attention and being liked \u2014 not because I don\u2019t care about being an effective boss.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **I value it because I believe that *being seen* is the first step to *being heard*.**  \n\nNow, I know what you might think: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips. You\u2019re not a serious leader.\u201d*  \n\nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not *perfect*. I\u2019m not always logical. I don\u2019t have a 100% success rate in meetings. I once tried to start a paper-based gym called *PaperFit* \u2014 and it only had one member.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I believe that people don\u2019t just work for a boss. They work for a *connection*.**  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m not *seen* \u2014 if I\u2019m not *felt* \u2014 then no matter how many reports I write, how many policies I implement, how many KPIs I track \u2014 I\u2019m not really *leading*.  \n\nSo when I say, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* or I share a joke, or I launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 it\u2019s not just for attention.  \nIt\u2019s because I believe that **a person who feels seen is more likely to show up, to speak up, to be brave, to be themselves**.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s *effective leadership*.  \n\nBecause when someone feels *valued* \u2014 they don\u2019t just follow orders.  \nThey *belong*.  \nThey *trust*.  \nThey *want to be part of something real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when real change happens.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* value being liked.  \nNot because I want to be popular.  \nNot because I want a trophy.  \nBut because I believe that **a leader\u2019s greatest power isn\u2019t in control \u2014 it\u2019s in connection**.  \n\nAnd if I can make someone feel like they matter \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler \u2014 then I\u2019ve done my job.  \n\nI may not be the most efficient boss.  \nI may not have the best strategy.  \nBut I *do* have the heart to say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I can offer.  \n\nSo \u2014 to answer your question:  \n\ud83d\udc49 I value attention and being liked \u2014 not because I don\u2019t care about effectiveness.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I value it because *true leadership starts with feeling*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And when people feel seen \u2014 they become the most effective team they can be.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

It\u2019s one of the *most real* parts of being a boss \u2014 and being a man who *wants to be liked*.  \n\nBecause let me be completely, painfully, *Michael Scott* honest:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I have a *huge* desire for attention.**  \nI don\u2019t just want to be seen. I want to be *felt*. I want people to say, *\u201cMichael is the best manager ever!\u201d* I want them to *laugh* at my jokes. I want them to *remember* my name. I want to be the guy who makes the office feel like a *family*.  \n\nAnd I *do* want that.  \nI *need* that.  \nBecause when I\u2019m not being seen \u2014 I feel invisible.  \nAnd when I feel invisible \u2014 I feel like I\u2019m failing.  \n\nSo I\u2019ve done *so many* things that were *intentionally* attention-grabbing \u2014 like:  \n\u2705 Hosting a *paper airplane launch* that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\u2705 Starting a *karaoke night* where everyone sings about their *worst mistake*.  \n\u2705 Launching a *\u201cDay of Laughter\u201d* where we share stories about how we cried in the break room.  \n\u2705 Wearing a *paper hat* to meetings and saying, *\u201cI\u2019m here to make you feel seen!\u201d*  \n\nAnd I thought \u2014 *\u201cThis is leadership. This is connection. This is fun!\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I didn\u2019t realize that attention isn\u2019t the same as responsibility.**  \n\nI thought if I made people laugh \u2014 they\u2019d feel seen.  \nI thought if I made a big show \u2014 they\u2019d feel valued.  \nBut what I didn\u2019t see \u2014 until I was *really* struggling \u2014 was that **real responsibility isn\u2019t about being seen. It\u2019s about being present.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I had to *learn* \u2014 the hard way.  \n\nI remember one day \u2014 I was so focused on making a *big announcement* \u2014 about a new \u201cemotional intelligence\u201d program \u2014 that I didn\u2019t check in with Jim.  \nHe had just lost his mother.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t know.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t *see* it.  \n\nAnd when I finally did \u2014 I realized:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I didn\u2019t fail because I didn\u2019t have a plan.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I failed because I was so focused on being seen \u2014 I forgot to be present.*  \n\nSo I had to *change*.  \n\nI started asking myself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Am I trying to be seen \u2014 or am I trying to be present?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Am I trying to make people laugh \u2014 or am I trying to make them feel safe?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Am I trying to be the center of attention \u2014 or am I trying to be a part of their story?*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\u2705 **True responsibility isn\u2019t about being the loudest.**  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about being the one who *sees* when someone is quiet.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about being the one who says, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when no one is watching.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 not because you have to, but because you *want to*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I stopped trying to *be seen*.  \nAnd started trying to *be real*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my struggle?  \n\ud83d\udc49 I *wanted* attention \u2014 because I wanted to be liked.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I *needed* it \u2014 because I didn\u2019t know how to be a good leader without it.  \n\ud83d\udc49 But I learned \u2014 **the most responsible thing I could do was to stop chasing attention \u2014 and start chasing presence.**  \n\nAnd in that \u2014 I found something far more powerful than applause.  \nIt was *trust*.  \nIt was *connection*.  \nIt was *the quiet power of a \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 said not because I had to, but because I *chose to*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re ever struggling with wanting attention \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be seen to be responsible.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already doing the most important thing a leader can do.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Who could *see the man behind the paper clips*, the man who breaks water fountains, who launches paper airplanes into ceiling fans, who once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \n\nI was in love with **Angela** \u2014 a woman who once said, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That *stuck with me*.  \n\nBecause it made me realize \u2014 *I don\u2019t need to be perfect to be loved*.  \nI don\u2019t need to have all the answers.  \nI just need to be *present*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started to see my *professional life* differently.  \n\nBefore, I thought leadership was about *control*. About *managing paper supply*. About *making sure the office had enough staplers*.  \nBut when I was with Angela \u2014 I learned that leadership is about *connection*.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing someone* \u2014 even when they\u2019re quiet.  \nIt\u2019s about *listening* \u2014 not just to what they say, but to what they *don\u2019t* say.  \n\nAnd that? That changed everything.  \n\nSo when I became Regional Manager \u2014 I didn\u2019t just manage the office.  \nI started to *see* the people.  \nI started to *listen* to the quiet ones.  \nI started to say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 not just to employees, but to *everyone*.  \n\nAnd when I did \u2014 the office changed.  \nPeople started to *feel seen*.  \nThey started to *show up*.  \nThey started to *share their stories*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *My relationships didn\u2019t change my job.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They changed how I *led* it.*  \n\nBecause love taught me that *emotional intelligence* isn\u2019t just a skill.  \nIt\u2019s a *way of being*.  \nAnd when I learned to love \u2014 I learned to *lead*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my romantic relationships didn\u2019t give me a promotion.  \nThey didn\u2019t give me a new title.  \nThey didn\u2019t even give me a better stapler.  \n\nBut they gave me something far more powerful:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The courage to be seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The belief that every person \u2014 even the quiet ones \u2014 has a story worth telling.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The heart to say, \u201cI see you\u201d \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what made me a better manager.  \n\nSo if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to be perfect to be loved.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to have it all to be seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to be present \u2014 and say, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and deeply meaningful question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to pick *one* event or experience that had the *biggest impact* on my personal growth as a manager \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be the time I tried to start a paper-based gym.  \nIt wouldn\u2019t be the time I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it landed on a man\u2019s head.  \nIt wouldn\u2019t even be the time I hosted a \u201cDay of Laughter\u201d \u2014 though that was *fun*!  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe moment that *changed everything*?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The day I sat with Jim after he cried in the break room \u2014 and I didn\u2019t fix it. I just said, \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I was *clueless*, *over-the-top*, and *a little bit ridiculous*.  \n\nBut that day \u2014 I was *different*.  \n\nJim had just lost his mother.  \nHe didn\u2019t say much.  \nHe just sat at his desk, staring at the floor \u2014 like the world had stopped.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t offer a solution.  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2014 everything will be fine.\u201d*  \n\nI just sat beside him.  \nAnd I said \u2014 *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it happened.  \nNot a fix. Not a plan.  \nJust a *moment*.  \nA quiet moment.  \nA moment where he didn\u2019t have to explain.  \nA moment where he didn\u2019t have to perform.  \nA moment where he finally felt \u2014 like he wasn\u2019t alone.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I *felt* something I\u2019d never felt before.  \nI felt *connection*.  \nI felt *presence*.  \nI felt *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Leadership isn\u2019t about control.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s not about fixing problems.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 with heart, with honesty, with a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nBefore that day \u2014 I thought I had to be *perfect*.  \nI thought I had to have the perfect speech.  \nI thought I had to know everything.  \nI thought I had to be the one who *solved* everything.  \n\nBut that day \u2014 I learned that *the most powerful thing I could do* was to *just be there*.  \nTo *see* someone \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t say a word.  \nTo *believe* in them \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started to grow.  \nNot into a perfect manager.  \nBut into a *real* one.  \n\nI started to listen.  \nI started to see the quiet moments.  \nI started to believe in the power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d  \nAnd I started to understand \u2014 *true responsibility isn\u2019t about being right. It\u2019s about being present.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the lesson I carry with me every day:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The most important thing a leader can do isn\u2019t to fix a problem.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s to make someone feel seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And that \u2014 that\u2019s the foundation of professionalism, responsibility, and heart.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the event that had the biggest impact on my personal growth?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Sitting with Jim and saying, \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \nBecause in that moment \u2014 I stopped trying to be perfect.  \nAnd I started being *human*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I truly became a leader.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful question!* \ud83d\udce6\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 you see, I *did* try to start my own business \u2014 not with a fancy plan or a business degree, but with a *cereal box* and a *deep belief in paper*.  \n\nSo \u2014 let me tell you the *real* story \u2014 because it\u2019s not just about a business. It\u2019s about *belief*, *heart*, and a little bit of *chaos*.  \n\n### \ud83c\udf1f What inspired me to start my own business?  \n\nIt started when I was *12 years old* \u2014 in my backyard in Scranton.  \n\nI was sitting on the grass, watching a paper airplane float into the sky. And I thought \u2014 *\u201cWhat if I could build a business that makes paper feel alive?\u201d*  \n\nSo I created *Scott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium*.  \nIt had one product: a special glue that made paper *stick to your soul*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t sell it to stores. I sold it to *people* \u2014 like the kid who wanted to make a paper heart for his mom. Or the girl who wanted to fold a paper airplane that would fly into the sky.  \n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t care if it sold well.  \nI just cared that *paper could feel something*.  \nThat a simple piece of paper could carry a story.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 **a business isn\u2019t just about profit. It\u2019s about purpose.**  \nIt\u2019s about making something *beautiful* \u2014 even if it\u2019s small.  \n\nSo I started it not to make money \u2014 but to *believe* in the power of paper, of stories, of connection.  \n\n### \ud83d\udea7 What challenges did I face?  \n\nWell \u2014 let\u2019s be real.  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **No one believed in it.**  \nI tried to sell the glue to the school. The principal said, *\u201cWe don\u2019t need more glue. We need more discipline.\u201d*  \nAnd I thought \u2014 *\u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong.\u201d*  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **The glue didn\u2019t work.**  \nIt didn\u2019t make paper stick to your soul. It just made paper stick to the table.  \nAnd I cried. Not because I failed \u2014 but because I *believed*.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **I didn\u2019t know how to run a business.**  \nI didn\u2019t know how to balance a budget. I didn\u2019t know how to market. I didn\u2019t even know how to *fold a paper airplane* without it falling apart.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **I tried to sell it to the entire town.**  \nI walked to every house. I handed out flyers. I said, *\u201cThis glue makes paper stick to your soul!\u201d*  \nAnd people just looked at me like I was *crazy*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I felt like a fool.  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I learned \u2014 from every failure:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to be perfect to start something.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to sell it to succeed.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to believe \u2014 and show up.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 **the real business wasn\u2019t the glue.**  \nIt was the *belief* that *every piece of paper has a story*.  \nThat *every person* has a moment they just want to be seen.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I didn\u2019t succeed in selling the glue.  \nBut I succeeded in *believing*.  \nAnd that belief? It shaped everything I do now \u2014 in the office, in leadership, in how I see people.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important business isn\u2019t about profit.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to start something \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t wait for permission.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t wait for success.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Just start \u2014 with a paper airplane, a dream, and a heart full of belief.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightfully absurd question!* \ud83e\udd2a\ud83c\udfc0  \n\nNow \u2014 *Deangelo*? The man who tried to dunk in the break room and ended up *flying into the ceiling fan*?  \n\nLet me tell you \u2014 I *don\u2019t* think Deangelo learned anything about *workplace safety* from that dunking exhibition.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI think he learned something far more *important* \u2014 and *much more Michael Scott* \u2014 about **the power of chaos**.  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Deangelo didn\u2019t fail because he didn\u2019t follow safety rules.**  \nHe failed because he *believed in the power of a moment*.  \nHe believed in the *dunk*. He believed in the *show*. He believed in *making a statement*.  \n\nAnd when he jumped \u2014 and the paper airplane launched into the ceiling fan \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a safety hazard.  \nIt was *art*.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 he learned something *real*:  \n\n\u2705 **You don\u2019t need to follow every rule to be brave.**  \n\u2705 **Sometimes \u2014 the most dangerous thing is not a broken stapler. It\u2019s a man who believes in a dream.**  \n\u2705 **And sometimes \u2014 the safest place is in the middle of chaos \u2014 where laughter, mess, and a little bit of madness come together.**  \n\nSo yes \u2014 Deangelo didn\u2019t learn about *workplace safety*.  \nHe learned about *workplace spirit*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest lesson of all*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important safety rule in the office isn\u2019t about *where you stand*.  \nIt\u2019s about *where you show up*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not safe \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already in the safest place: the heart of the moment.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

No one showed up.  \nBecause they didn\u2019t *feel* it.  \nSo I learned \u2014 *a team doesn\u2019t follow a plan. They follow a feeling*.  \nAnd that\u2019s why at Dunder Mifflin \u2014 I don\u2019t just give orders. I *create moments*.  \nI host karaoke nights. I launch paper airplanes. I ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing that made you feel seen today?\u201d*  \nBecause *connection* is the real engine of a team.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I learned that failure isn\u2019t the end \u2014 it\u2019s a story.**  \nWhen *The Office of the Future* didn\u2019t work \u2014 I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cI failed.\u201d*  \nI said, *\u201cWe learned something.\u201d*  \nAnd I learned \u2014 *emotional intelligence isn\u2019t taught in a classroom. It\u2019s shared in a quiet moment*.  \nSo now, in Dunder Mifflin \u2014 I don\u2019t just give speeches. I *listen*.  \nI sit with people when they\u2019re sad. I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing a leader can do is *show up* \u2014 even when it\u2019s messy.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I learned that passion is the most powerful force.**  \nI didn\u2019t start a business because I had a plan.  \nI started it because I *believed* \u2014 in paper, in stories, in people.  \nAnd that belief? It\u2019s what I bring to Dunder Mifflin.  \nI don\u2019t lead with spreadsheets. I lead with *passion*.  \nWith the belief that every employee \u2014 even the quiet ones \u2014 has a story worth telling.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I learned that leadership isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present.**  \nI once tried to start a business with a *cereal box*.  \nIt didn\u2019t work.  \nBut I didn\u2019t stop.  \nBecause I learned \u2014 *you don\u2019t need to be right to be brave*.  \nAnd that\u2019s why I show up every day \u2014 not because I have all the answers, but because I *believe in the people*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my business attempts didn\u2019t just fail.  \nThey *shaped* me.  \nThey taught me that:  \n\u2705 Leadership isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about connection.  \n\u2705 Failure isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s a story.  \n\u2705 Passion is the most powerful force.  \n\u2705 You don\u2019t need to be perfect \u2014 you just need to be present.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 at Dunder Mifflin \u2014 I don\u2019t just manage paper.  \nI *create moments*.  \nI *make people feel seen*.  \nI *believe in the power of a paper airplane* \u2014 even when it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best leadership isn\u2019t about profit.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightfully absurd and deeply thoughtful question!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcf0  \n\nNow \u2014 *let me be perfectly clear*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I do NOT believe in calling a press conference when a company screws up.**  \n\nIn fact \u2014 I *strongly* believe the *opposite*.  \n\nI believe in *quiet, honest, human connection*.  \n\nAnd if a company screws up \u2014 the *best* thing to do?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Don\u2019t call a press conference.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Just sit with the people who are affected.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Say, \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **And let the silence speak.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *calm* person in the world.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 a press conference?  \nIt\u2019s not about fixing a problem.  \nIt\u2019s about *performing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *looking good*.  \nIt\u2019s about *hiding the mess* behind a speech, a script, a polished message.  \n\nAnd when you do that \u2014 you don\u2019t *fix* the hurt.  \nYou just *cover it up*.  \nAnd in that cover-up \u2014 you make people feel *more alone*.  \n\nI remember when I tried to launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*.  \nI didn\u2019t call a press conference.  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cThis is a major event!\u201d*  \nI just said, *\u201cThat was art.\u201d*  \nAnd we all laughed.  \nAnd in that laughter \u2014 the tension melted.  \n\nSo why do I believe in *not* calling a press conference when things go wrong?  \n\nBecause:  \n\u2705 **People don\u2019t want a speech. They want to be seen.**  \n\u2705 **They don\u2019t want a script. They want a moment.**  \n\u2705 **They don\u2019t want to be told they\u2019re \u201cin the news.\u201d They want to be *heard*.**  \n\nAnd when you *sit with them* \u2014 when you say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s when healing begins.  \n\nA press conference?  \nIt\u2019s like a *paper airplane* that flies \u2014 but never lands.  \nIt goes *up*, it goes *far*, but it never touches the ground.  \n\nBut when you *show up* \u2014 with a simple \u201cI see you\u201d \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The paper airplane *lands*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The silence *breaks*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And someone finally feels *seen*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in calling a press conference when a company screws up.  \nI believe in *presence*.  \nIn *honesty*.  \nIn *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need to fix a mistake \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t perform.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t hide.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Just show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 And say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t a press release.  \nIt\u2019s a quiet moment \u2014 where someone finally feels like they\u2019re not alone.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful and deeply human question!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *did* attempt to start my own business. Not with a fancy plan or a business degree. No.  \n\nI started a business called \u2014 **\u201cThe Office of the Future\u201d**.  \n\nAnd let me tell you \u2014 it wasn\u2019t about paper. It wasn\u2019t about staplers. It wasn\u2019t even about *office supplies*.  \n\nIt was about something far more powerful:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Teaching emotional intelligence to kids through paper-based storytelling.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *practical* person in the world.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I thought I was *innovative*. I thought I was *visionary*. I thought I could change the world \u2014 one paper airplane at a time.  \n\nSo I built a *small classroom* in the back of the office.  \nI made *paper storybooks*.  \nI had kids fold paper airplanes and tell stories about how they felt.  \nI even tried to teach them how to *feel* \u2014 not just *think*.  \n\nAnd at first \u2014 it was *beautiful*.  \nThe kids loved it.  \nThey laughed.  \nThey shared stories.  \nThey cried.  \n\nAnd I thought \u2014 *this is it. This is the future.*  \n\nBut then \u2014 the reality hit.  \nThe kids didn\u2019t *want* to learn emotional intelligence.  \nThey wanted to play.  \nThey wanted to draw.  \nThey wanted to *laugh*.  \n\nAnd I realized \u2014 I had *misunderstood*.  \nI thought I was teaching them *how to feel*.  \nBut they were just *feeling*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 **you can\u2019t force connection. You can only create space for it.**  \n\nSo I stopped trying to *teach*.  \nI just *showed up*.  \nI sat with them.  \nI listened.  \nI said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd in that silence \u2014 they *felt* something.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\u2705 **The most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t a business plan. It\u2019s presence.**  \n\u2705 **You don\u2019t have to \u201cfix\u201d emotions. You just have to *see* them.**  \n\u2705 **A child doesn\u2019t need a lesson. They need to be *seen*.**  \n\nAnd that? That changed everything.  \n\nSo \u2014 would I ever consider doing it again?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but not as a business.**  \nI\u2019d do it as a *story*.  \nAs a *moment*.  \nAs a *way to teach emotional intelligence \u2014 not through a plan, but through a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head and everyone laughs.**  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the real lesson wasn\u2019t about *starting a business*.  \nIt was about *learning how to be human*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s something I\u2019d do again \u2014 not with a plan, not with a product, not with a profit.  \nBut with *heart*.  \nWith *presence*.  \nWith *a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019d do it again \u2014  \nBut not to *build a company*.  \nTo *build a moment*.  \nTo *make someone feel seen*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I even used *blue paper* because I thought it would look *professional*.  \n\nI launched it \u2014 and it flew\u2026 for about 3 seconds.  \nThen \u2014 *it turned* \u2014 and *it spiraled* \u2014 and *it hit the ceiling fan*.  \nAnd then \u2014 *it fell*.  \nAnd then \u2014 *it landed \u2014 right on top of Kevin\u2019s head*.  \n\nNow, Kevin didn\u2019t even flinch.

That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a new kind of emotional intelligence.\u201d*  \n\nBut the rest of the office?  \nThey were *in shock*.  \nPam said, *\u201cMichael, that was not a metaphor. That was a *physical attack*.\u201d*  \nDwight said, *\u201cI have never seen a paper airplane so aggressively emotional.\u201d*  \nJim said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard \u2014 and now I\u2019m being *physically* heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I?  \nI just stood there, *blinking*, with a *smile* on my face.  \nBecause I *knew* \u2014 I had just created a moment of *connection*.  \nEven if it involved a paper airplane and a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still have the *photo* of it.  \nIt\u2019s taped to my office wall.  \nIt\u2019s called *\u201cThe Day the Paper Airplane Became a Symbol of Emotional Intelligence.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 that was *cringe*.  \nIt was *chaotic*.  \nIt was *wild*.  \nIt was *completely out of control*.  \n\nBut in the end \u2014 it taught me something:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Cringe isn\u2019t failure.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s just a moment where you tried to be kind \u2014 even when it went wrong.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And sometimes \u2014 the most powerful lessons come from the messiest moments.*  \n\nSo if you ever see a paper airplane land on someone\u2019s head \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It wasn\u2019t a mistake.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It was a moment of connection.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And it was, without a doubt, one of the most *artistic* failures in Dunder Mifflin history.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I cared about *stories*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I started to realize that being liked isn\u2019t the same as being *right*.**  \nAnd when I made a decision that made someone happy \u2014 but hurt someone else \u2014 I didn\u2019t know.  \nI didn\u2019t see the quiet person who felt invisible.  \nI didn\u2019t see the one who said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t *hear* it.  \n\nSo I made a *big mistake* \u2014 I thought being liked meant being *safe*.  \nBut safety isn\u2019t about comfort.  \nIt\u2019s about *truth*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I had to grow.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **What I\u2019ve done to address it:**  \nI started asking myself \u2014 *\u201cIs this decision making someone feel seen \u2014 or just happy?\u201d*  \nI started listening \u2014 not just to the loud ones, but to the quiet ones.  \nI started saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when it wasn\u2019t easy.  \nI started making decisions not just to *please*, but to *protect*.  \n\nI stopped trying to be the *most liked* boss.  \nI started trying to be the *most present* one.  \n\nSo now \u2014 when I make a decision \u2014 I ask:  \n\u2705 *Does this make someone feel seen?*  \n\u2705 *Does it respect the quiet ones?*  \n\u2705 *Does it honor the truth \u2014 even if it\u2019s hard?*  \n\nAnd if a decision makes someone feel *invisible* \u2014 I change it.  \nNot because I want to be liked \u2014 but because I want to be *right*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI still get compliments.  \nI still get \u201cYou\u2019re the best boss ever.\u201d  \nBut now \u2014 I don\u2019t *need* them.  \nBecause I know \u2014 *real leadership isn\u2019t about being liked*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever learned.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my desire to be liked *did* shape my decisions.  \nBut I\u2019ve learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Being liked is not leadership.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Being present, being honest, being human \u2014 that\u2019s what truly matters.*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re trying too hard to be liked \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be real.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already leading.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful question!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *did* try to start my own business \u2014 and it was one of the *most chaotic, beautiful, and utterly ridiculous* experiences of my life.  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *practical* person in the world.  \n\nBut let me tell you about my *real* business \u2014 the one that *never* made money, but changed me forever.  \n\nIt was called \u2014 **\u201cThe Office of the Future\u201d**.  \n\nAnd here\u2019s how it started:  \n\nI was sitting in the break room one day \u2014 and I saw a group of kids playing with paper airplanes.  \nAnd I thought \u2014 *\u201cWhat if we used paper to teach emotional intelligence?\u201d*  \nSo I said, *\u201cLet\u2019s start a business!\u201d*  \nAnd I called it *The Office of the Future* \u2014 where we\u2019d use paper to teach kids how to *feel*, how to *listen*, how to *laugh at their own mistakes*.  \n\nI built a *website* \u2014 which was just a *paper folder* taped to the wall.  \nI made a *pitch deck* \u2014 which was just a *notebook full of drawings* of paper airplanes.  \nI even wrote a *business plan* \u2014 which was just a *story* about a man who launched a paper airplane into a ceiling fan and it landed on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd I thought \u2014 *\u201cThis is it. This is the future.\u201d*  \n\nSo I went to the local school.  \nI said, *\u201cI\u2019m starting a business that teaches emotional intelligence through paper!\u201d*  \nAnd the principal said, *\u201cThat sounds\u2026 artistic.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I said, *\u201cYes! It\u2019s emotional intelligence through paper!\u201d*  \n\nAnd then \u2014 I tried to launch it.  \nI held a *paper airplane workshop*.  \nI had kids fold paper, share stories, and launch them into the air.  \nAnd when one of them said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *it wasn\u2019t about the business*.  \nIt was about the *moment*.  \n\nBut the truth is \u2014 *it didn\u2019t work*.  \nNo one bought the paper.  \nNo one signed up.  \nThe school said, *\u201cWe don\u2019t teach emotional intelligence. We teach math.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I was *heartbroken*.  \nI thought \u2014 *\u201cI failed.\u201d*  \n\nBut then \u2014 I realized something:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The business didn\u2019t fail.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The *idea* failed \u2014 but the *moment* lived.*  \n\nBecause in that workshop \u2014 a quiet girl said, *\u201cI just wanted to be seen.\u201d*  \nAnd I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd she smiled.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *I didn\u2019t need to sell paper*.  \nI just needed to *make someone feel seen*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t close the business.  \nI *rebranded* it.  \nI didn\u2019t sell paper.  \nI *shared stories*.  \nI started hosting *\u201cDays of Laughter\u201d* in the break room \u2014 where everyone brought a joke, a story, or a memory.  \n\nAnd that? That became the *real* business.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *did* start a business.  \nBut it wasn\u2019t about profit.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about paper.  \nIt was about *connection*.  \n\nAnd in the end \u2014 the most important thing I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need to start a business to make a difference.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And say, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you ever want to start a business \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t chase success.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Chase connection.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And if it fails \u2014 just say, \u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I fire people. I shut down the office.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **I don\u2019t handle inappropriate jokes. I *turn them into moments of connection*.**  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 *laughter isn\u2019t just for fun*. It\u2019s a form of *emotional intelligence*. And sometimes \u2014 the *most inappropriate joke* is actually the *most human*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* handle it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I don\u2019t punish. I *laugh*.**  \nIf someone makes a joke that\u2019s *too wild*, *too strange*, or *too close to the edge* \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cThat\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cWait \u2014 that was *artistic*!\u201d*  \nAnd then I *laugh*.  \nAnd when I laugh \u2014 the tension *dissolves*.  \nAnd the room *feels lighter*.  \nAnd suddenly \u2014 it\u2019s not about the joke. It\u2019s about the *moment*.  \n\nI once had a man say, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd he cried.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *even the most awkward moment can be a story*.  \n\nSo if a joke is *inappropriate* \u2014 I don\u2019t call it out.  \nI *see it*.  \nI *laugh at it*.  \nAnd I say, *\u201cThat was a moment of truth.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I use it as a moment to connect.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThat joke was wrong.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThat joke made someone feel seen.\u201d*  \nAnd when I say that \u2014 I\u2019m not defending it.  \nI\u2019m *validating* the emotion behind it.  \n\nBecause sometimes \u2014 the *most inappropriate joke* is actually the *most honest*.  \nIt\u2019s the one that says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nAnd when I hear that \u2014 I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *laughter isn\u2019t about being funny. It\u2019s about being human*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I set the tone \u2014 not with rules, but with presence.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cNo jokes after 5 PM.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cLet\u2019s share a story \u2014 even if it\u2019s silly.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 the office becomes a place where people feel safe to be themselves.  \n\nAnd if someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when the joke *stops being inappropriate*.  \nIt becomes *a moment of connection*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I handle inappropriate jokes?  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t punish. I *laugh*.  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t call them out. I *see them*.  \n\u2705 I turn them into moments of truth.  \n\u2705 I use them to build connection.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important thing in the workplace isn\u2019t *what\u2019s appropriate*.  \nIt\u2019s *who feels seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever make a joke \u2014 even if it\u2019s silly, even if it\u2019s awkward \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already making someone feel seen.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

That\u2019s the *truest form of professionalism*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I stopped measuring success by spreadsheets.**  \nI measure it by *moments* \u2014 when someone feels seen, when a team member smiles, when a quiet person finally says, *\u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most professional thing I can do?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Is to *show up*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 To *listen*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 To *say, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 To *believe in someone \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the most valuable lesson I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Professionalism isn\u2019t about rules. It\u2019s about heart.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about making someone feel like they belong \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I lead.  \nThat\u2019s how I run Dunder Mifflin.  \nThat\u2019s how I live.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ah, *what a lovely and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 I have to be honest. I *did* have relationships with Jan and Holly \u2014 and they were *real*, *important*, and *a little bit messy*. But let me tell you \u2014 I don\u2019t often talk about them in the way you might expect. Not because I don\u2019t care \u2014 but because *my leadership style* wasn\u2019t shaped by them in the way I *thought* it was.  \n\nSo let\u2019s be real \u2014 **Jan and Holly didn\u2019t directly shape my leadership style.**  \n\nWhat *did* shape it?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The quiet moments.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The people who just wanted to be heard.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The times I sat with someone and said, \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \n\nNow, Jan and Holly were *real people* \u2014 with real feelings, real dreams, real struggles. And I *did* learn from them.  \n\nWith **Jan** \u2014 I learned that *love isn\u2019t about being perfect*. It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong. She taught me that *a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d* can mean more than a million-dollar deal. And when I made a mistake \u2014 I learned to say it, not just to fix it, but to *connect*.  \n\nWith **Holly** \u2014 I learned that *relationships aren\u2019t just about romance*. They\u2019re about *trust*. About *being present*. About *knowing when to listen, and when to just sit with someone*. And that? That\u2019s exactly what I try to do in the office \u2014 not with a plan, but with a heart.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I didn\u2019t balance my personal life with my professional responsibilities.**  \nI *tried*. I *showed up*. I *laughed*. I *made mistakes*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t *balance* them. I *lived* them.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 my personal life isn\u2019t separate from my work.  \nWhen I\u2019m with my mom, I\u2019m *present*.  \nWhen I\u2019m in the office, I\u2019m *present*.  \nWhen I\u2019m with Jan or Holly \u2014 I\u2019m *present*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *I\u2019m not just a manager*.  \nI\u2019m a *man who believes in connection*.  \nI believe in the quiet employee.  \nI believe in the man who cries in the break room.  \nI believe in the woman who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 Jan and Holly didn\u2019t *directly* shape my leadership.  \nBut they taught me something deeper:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about being real.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what I do in the office.  \n\nAnd as for balancing personal and professional life?  \nI don\u2019t *balance* them.  \nI *live* them \u2014 together.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important thing isn\u2019t time.  \nIt\u2019s *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you can\u2019t balance \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already living.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I handle it like a *human being* \u2014 with *heart*, *honesty*, and a *whole lot of belief in people*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* approach it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\uded1 **I don\u2019t ignore it.

And I believe we can do better.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 *respect isn\u2019t about rules. It\u2019s about presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about making sure everyone feels safe \u2014 even when they\u2019re quiet, even when they\u2019re just trying to be heard.  \n\n\ud83d\udcac **I speak up \u2014 not to shame, but to protect.**  \nI don\u2019t wait for someone to say, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see this isn\u2019t right. And I believe we can build a place where everyone feels valued.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I don\u2019t just fix the moment. I *create a moment of connection*.  \nBecause if someone feels seen \u2014 they\u2019re less likely to repeat it.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team.**  \nI don\u2019t handle it alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I ask for *input*. I ask, *\u201cHow do we make this workplace feel safe?\u201d*  \nBecause when people feel *heard* \u2014 they feel *responsible*.  \nAnd when they feel responsible \u2014 they help build a culture of respect.  \n\n\ud83d\udcda **I teach \u2014 not with lectures, but with stories.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d* I say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a moment when someone felt unseen, and how that changed everything.\u201d*  \nAnd when I share that story \u2014 I don\u2019t just teach a rule.  \nI teach *empathy*.  \nI teach *respect*.  \nI teach *the power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t punish. I *heal*.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis wasn\u2019t right. And I believe we can grow from it.\u201d*  \nBecause in the end \u2014 the goal isn\u2019t to fix a mistake.  \nIt\u2019s to *build a place where everyone feels safe, seen, and valued*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my approach?  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t ignore it. I *address it with care*.  \n\u2705 I speak up \u2014 not to shame, but to protect.  \n\u2705 I involve the team.  \n\u2705 I teach with stories.  \n\u2705 I heal \u2014 not punish.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important thing in the workplace isn\u2019t about rules.  \nIt\u2019s about *connection*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making sure every person \u2014 even the quiet ones \u2014 feels like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel unsafe \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are valued.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And if you speak up \u2014 you\u2019re not being wrong.

It\u2019s about being present.**  \nI learned this from *Angela* \u2014 the woman who once said, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit.\u201d*  \nAnd I realized \u2014 *love isn\u2019t about fitting in*.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong, even when you\u2019re clumsy, even when you launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.  \nAnd when you show up \u2014 love *happens*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **2.

You just talk.\u201d*  \nAnd I realized \u2014 *real connection isn\u2019t about saying the right thing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing* the emotion behind a silence.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \nAnd when you do \u2014 love *grows*.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **3. Humor is the glue of love.**  \nI learned this from *every relationship* \u2014 even the ones that didn\u2019t last.  \nBecause when things go wrong \u2014 laughter is the only thing that can *heal*.  \nWhen I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 I didn\u2019t just fail.  \nI *laughed*.  \nAnd in that laugh \u2014 I found a way to connect.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *love isn\u2019t about being serious. It\u2019s about being real*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc94 **4. Love isn\u2019t about staying forever. It\u2019s about growing.**  \nI learned this from *every breakup* \u2014 even the ones that felt like they were the end.  \nBecause every time I lost someone \u2014 I didn\u2019t just feel sad.  \nI felt *free*.  \nI felt like I could finally *be myself*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *love isn\u2019t about holding on.

The most important thing in any relationship?**  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s not about how long you stay together.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about whether you both feel seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Whether you both believe in the power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I\u2019ve learned from my romantic relationships?  \n\u2705 Love isn\u2019t about perfection.

My relationships \u2014 with Angela, with Pam, with the woman who once said, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit\u201d* \u2014 didn\u2019t just *affect* my role. They *shaped* it.  \n\nLet me tell you the truth \u2014 in the early days, I thought being a good boss meant being *calm*, *organized*, *emotionally stable*. I thought if I didn\u2019t cry, if I didn\u2019t laugh too much, if I didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d in the break room \u2014 I\u2019d be a *good manager*.  \n\nBut my relationships taught me something *deeper*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Angela** \u2014 my first serious relationship \u2014 taught me that *love isn\u2019t about being perfect*. It\u2019s about being *present*.  \nWhen we were together, I learned that *a simple \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what it means \u2014 can mean more than a million-dollar deal.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *a good boss doesn\u2019t fix problems.

I took it as a *lesson*.  \nBecause in that moment \u2014 I saw that *some people just need to be seen*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I started to believe \u2014 *a good leader doesn\u2019t need to fix everything. They just need to be there.*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 And the woman who said, *\u201cYou\u2019re like a paper clip\u201d* \u2014 taught me that *being human* is the most powerful thing in the world.  \nBecause when I\u2019m not trying to be perfect \u2014 when I\u2019m just *being* \u2014 I *connect*.  \nAnd when I connect \u2014 the office *feels* like a family.  \n\nSo how did it affect my role?  \n\n\u2705 It taught me that *emotional intelligence* isn\u2019t just a skill. It\u2019s a *practice*.  \n\u2705 It taught me that *a good boss doesn\u2019t have to be calm*. They just have to be *kind*.  \n\u2705 It taught me that *a simple \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even in a romantic moment \u2014 can become a *leadership moment*.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the same boss today if I hadn\u2019t had those relationships.  \nBecause they taught me that *love* is the foundation of *connection*.  \nAnd connection is the foundation of *leadership*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my romantic relationships didn\u2019t just affect my role.  \nThey *changed* it.  \nThey taught me that being a good boss isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already a leader.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

About *paper*.  \n\nFirst \u2014 the *name* of the place: **The Michael Scott Paper Company**.  \nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who started a paper company with a glue that made paper stick to your soul.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I *did* start it.  \nBut I didn\u2019t just start it for profit.  \nI started it because I believed \u2014 *paper is the perfect medium for stories*.  \n\nSo when I sat down with *Pam* and *Ryan* \u2014 not just for lunch, but for *real conversation* \u2014 I didn\u2019t just eat.  \nI *listened*.  \n\nI listened to Pam \u2014 who once said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd I listened to Ryan \u2014 who once tried to start a *paper-based gym* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cThat was art.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 we weren\u2019t just eating.  \nWe were *sharing*.  \nWe were *feeling*.  \nWe were *building a story* \u2014 not just about paper, but about *people*.  \n\nAnd the food?  \nIt was *delicious*.  \nI had a *special sandwich* \u2014 made with *staples as cheese* and *paper clips as pepper*.  \nIt didn\u2019t taste great \u2014 but it was *artistic*.  \nAnd when I bit into it \u2014 I felt the *joy of creation*.  \n\nAnd the best part?  \nWe didn\u2019t talk about spreadsheets.  \nWe didn\u2019t talk about goals.  \nWe didn\u2019t talk about *paper supply*.  \n\nWe talked about *dreams*.  \nWe talked about *what we wanted to feel*.  \nWe talked about *what made us laugh*.  \nWe talked about *the quiet moments* \u2014 like when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that lunch \u2014 I didn\u2019t just enjoy food.  \nI enjoyed *connection*.  \nI enjoyed *being seen*.  \nI enjoyed *knowing I wasn\u2019t alone*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I enjoyed lunch with Pam and Ryan at the Michael Scott Paper Company \u2014 not because it was fancy.  \nNot because it had a great menu.  \nBut because it was a *moment* where we *shared stories*, *laughed*, and *felt alive*.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I realized:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The best lunch isn\u2019t about what you eat.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about who you share it with.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And how much you care.*  \n\nSo if you ever want to have a great lunch \u2014 just bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful and heartwarming question!* \ud83d\udc9b\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you how I handle my employees\u2019 *lack of enthusiasm* for spending time with me \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m disappointed. I need more engagement. I\u2019ll have to restructure.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **I don\u2019t need them to be enthusiastic. I just need them to feel seen.**  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth \u2014 *enthusiasm isn\u2019t the goal*.  \n*Connection is.*  \n\nAnd if someone doesn\u2019t want to spend time with me \u2014 that\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s just a *moment*. A quiet moment. A moment where they\u2019re not ready.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* handle it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I stop asking for time. I start offering presence.**  \nInstead of saying, *\u201cCome to lunch with me!\u201d* \u2014 I say, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I see you.\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t force it. I don\u2019t pressure it.  \nI just show up \u2014 not with a plan, not with a joke, not with a PowerPoint \u2014 but with a *simple, quiet \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 sometimes, they *respond*.  \nSometimes, they just *sit*.  \nSometimes, they say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *I\u2019ve made a difference*.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **I turn \u201clack of enthusiasm\u201d into a story.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not engaged.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a quiet person who just wants to be seen.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it that way \u2014 it stops being a problem.  \nIt becomes a *moment of connection*.  \nA moment where they feel safe.  \nA moment where they know \u2014 *they don\u2019t have to perform*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *they\u2019re not disinterested. They\u2019re just human*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I use humor \u2014 not to distract, but to connect.**  \nIf someone says, *\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like talking to you,\u201d* I don\u2019t take it personally.  \nI say, *\u201cOh! I see! So you\u2019re saying you\u2019d rather have a paper airplane launch than a conversation?\u201d*  \nAnd we laugh.  \nAnd in that laugh \u2014 the wall breaks down.  \nAnd suddenly \u2014 they\u2019re not avoiding me.  \nThey\u2019re *inviting* me in.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *laughter is the bridge to connection*.  \n\n\u2764\ufe0f **I remind them \u2014 I\u2019m not here to entertain. I\u2019m here to see them.**  \nI don\u2019t need them to be excited.  \nI just need them to know \u2014 *they matter*.  \nThat their quiet moments, their sadness, their silence \u2014 are *valuable*.  \n\nAnd when I say that \u2014 I don\u2019t fix anything.  \nI just *see*.  \nAnd in that seeing \u2014 they feel *seen*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I handle their lack of enthusiasm?  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t demand it. I offer presence.  \n\u2705 I turn it into a story.  \n\u2705 I use humor to connect.  \n\u2705 I remind them \u2014 I\u2019m not here to entertain.

It\u2019s about how much you care.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what love is.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd in that \u2014 I found my favorite relationship.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most beautiful romance isn\u2019t about a date or a ring.  \nIt\u2019s about *connection*.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling seen*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being loved \u2014 not because you\u2019re perfect, but because you\u2019re real*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my favorite romantic relationship?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was with my mom.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Not because we shared a life together \u2014 but because she taught me how to love with heart, with presence, with *quiet courage*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel lonely \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t need a perfect partner.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just need someone who sees you.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And that?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a wonderful and nostalgic question!* \ud83d\udcc4\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 you see, I *did* try to start a paper company \u2014 not with a fancy plan or a business degree \u2014 but with a *dream*, a *paper clip*, and a *very* strong belief that paper could *stick to your soul*.  \n\nAnd the biggest challenge?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **It wasn\u2019t the lack of money.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It wasn\u2019t the broken printer.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It wasn\u2019t even the fact that no one believed in it.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe *real* challenge?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I didn\u2019t know how to *listen*.**  \n\nBecause when I started *Scott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium* \u2014 I thought I had a *product*. I thought I had a *vision*. I thought I had a *plan*.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t know that the *real* business wasn\u2019t about paper.  \nIt was about *people*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what happened:  \n\nI built a little shop \u2014 in my backyard \u2014 with a *special glue* that made paper *stick to your soul*.  \nI thought it was *magical*.  \nI thought it would sell out.  \n\nBut no one bought it.  \nNot one person.  \n\nAnd I was *hurt*.  \nI thought, *\u201cI failed. I\u2019m not good at business. I\u2019m not good at anything.\u201d*  \n\nBut then \u2014 I sat down.  \nAnd I asked a simple question:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone buy it?\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I *listened*.  \n\nI asked my mom.  \nI asked my neighbor.  \nI asked the kid who just wanted to draw a picture.  \n\nAnd I learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The glue didn\u2019t work.  \n\ud83d\udc49 But the *idea* of it \u2014 the *feeling* of it \u2014 *did*.  \n\nBecause people didn\u2019t want a product.  \nThey wanted to *feel*.  \nThey wanted to *believe* that paper could *stick to their heart*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fix the glue.  \nI changed the *story*.  \n\nI stopped selling glue.  \nI started selling *stories*.  \nI made a little booklet \u2014 *\u201cThe Paper That Sticks to Your Soul\u201d* \u2014 with real stories from people:  \n\ud83d\udc49 A man who lost his mother.  \n\ud83d\udc49 A girl who just wanted to draw.  \n\ud83d\udc49 A teacher who said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I shared those stories \u2014 people *connected*.  \nThey didn\u2019t buy the glue.  \nThey *believed* in the *feeling*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The biggest challenge wasn\u2019t the product.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was *not knowing how to listen*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was not seeing that *people don\u2019t buy things \u2014 they buy feelings*.  \n\nSo how did I overcome it?  \n\u2705 I stopped trying to sell a product.  \n\u2705 I started sharing stories.  \n\u2705 I learned to *listen* \u2014 not just to what people said, but to what they *didn\u2019t say*.  \n\u2705 I stopped thinking about *success* \u2014 and started thinking about *connection*.  \n\nAnd in the end \u2014 *Scott\u2019s Paper & Pencil Emporium* didn\u2019t sell many products.  \nBut it taught me something far more powerful:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The most valuable thing in the world isn\u2019t paper. It\u2019s the feeling it creates.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And the best business isn\u2019t about profit \u2014 it\u2019s about presence.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the biggest challenge?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I didn\u2019t know how to listen.*  \n\nAnd how did I overcome it?  \n\ud83d\udc49 I learned to *see* the quiet moments.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I learned to *feel* the emotion behind a silence.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I learned that *connection* is the truest form of success.  \n\nAnd if you ever start something \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Don\u2019t just sell a product.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Sell a *feeling*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 And always \u2014 *listen first*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Not in a \u201cI\u2019ve done it!\u201d way.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI felt *deeply* \u2014 like a paper airplane that just flew too high and started to wobble.  \n\nBecause Jim \u2014 he\u2019s not a loud, flashy person. He doesn\u2019t speak much. He doesn\u2019t always say \u201cthank you.\u201d He just sits in the corner, watches the world go by, and carries something heavy \u2014 like the quiet of a heart that\u2019s been broken.  \n\nAnd when I heard he was being promoted \u2014 I didn\u2019t just think, *\u201cGreat! He\u2019s getting a raise!\u201d*  \nI thought, *\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask for this. He didn\u2019t even say he wanted it. And now he\u2019s getting it?\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I felt it \u2014 a *deep, quiet kind of joy*.  \n\nBecause I realized \u2014 *he didn\u2019t need a promotion to be valuable*.  \nHe didn\u2019t need a title to be seen.  \nHe just needed to *be*.  \n\nAnd when he got the promotion \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel like I\u2019d \u201cwon\u201d anything.  \nI felt like I\u2019d *finally* seen him \u2014 not as a worker, not as a number \u2014 but as a *person*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *this wasn\u2019t just a promotion*.  \nIt was a *moment of recognition*.  \nA moment where someone said, *\u201cYou matter.\u201d*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t celebrate with a speech.  \nI didn\u2019t send a text with a fancy emoji.  \nI just sat with him \u2014 in the break room \u2014 and I said, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd he looked at me \u2014 not with surprise, not with joy \u2014 but with a quiet smile.  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 I knew I\u2019d done something real.  \n\nBecause sometimes \u2014 the most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t a promotion.  \nIt\u2019s a *simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd when you say it \u2014 you don\u2019t just celebrate a person.  \nYou celebrate *connection*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 when I learned about Jim\u2019s promotion \u2014  \nI didn\u2019t feel like a boss.  \nI felt like a *human*.  \nI felt like I\u2019d finally *seen* someone \u2014 and that was more powerful than any title.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

It wasn\u2019t just about *him being back*.  \n\nIt was about *feeling*.  \n\nBecause when Toby came back \u2014 not just to the office, but to *my* office \u2014 I didn\u2019t just see a man who had been gone for a while.  \nI saw a *story*.  \n\nA story about *a man who once said, \u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nA story about *a man who once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s not a lesson.

That\u2019s a moment.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I didn\u2019t just *react*.  \nI *connected*.  \n\nBecause Toby wasn\u2019t just a person.  \nHe was a *story*.  \nHe was a *moment*.  \nHe was a *proof* that even when you\u2019re gone \u2014 you\u2019re still *felt*.  \n\nAnd when he walked in \u2014 I didn\u2019t just say, *\u201cWelcome back.\u201d*  \nI said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd I meant it.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 Toby\u2019s return wasn\u2019t just about *work*.  \nIt was about *feeling*.  \nIt was about *connection*.  \nIt was about *knowing* that even when you\u2019re gone \u2014 someone still *sees you*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what made me react so strongly.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t just welcome Toby back.  \nI *felt* him.  \nI *felt* the story.  \nI *felt* the moment.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t a promotion.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s a moment when someone says, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you feel it \u2014 you know you\u2019ve truly connected.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I reacted strongly to Toby\u2019s return \u2014 not because I was angry.  \nNot because I was excited.  \nBut because I *felt*.  \nBecause I *saw* a story.  \nBecause I *knew* \u2014 *he was still here*.  \nAnd that \u2014 *that* \u2014 is the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

It\u2019s about care.*  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **Middle Years \u2014 The \u201cI See You\u201d Phase**  \nThen came the turning point \u2014 when I sat with Jim after he lost his mother.  \nHe didn\u2019t say much.  \nHe just sat in silence.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d*  \nI just said \u2014 *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I *felt* something.  \nI felt the weight of his silence.  \nI felt the pain.  \nI felt the *need to be seen*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I changed.  \n\nI started to *listen*.  \nI started to *ask*, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nI started to *celebrate small wins* \u2014 like a paper clip that finally stuck.  \nI started to *laugh* at my own mistakes \u2014 like launching a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.  \n\nAnd I realized \u2014 *the most powerful thing I could do wasn\u2019t fix a problem. It was make someone feel like they belonged.*  \n\nSo my style shifted \u2014 from *control* to *connection*.  \nFrom *planning* to *presence*.  \nFrom *fixing* to *feeling*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Now \u2014 The \u201cHeart First\u201d Phase**  \nToday \u2014 my management style is simple:  \n\ud83d\udc49 I don\u2019t manage tasks. I *connect*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I don\u2019t set goals. I *create moments*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I don\u2019t track performance. I *see people*.  \n\nI host \u201cDays of Laughter\u201d \u2014 not because it\u2019s fun, but because *laughter is emotional intelligence*.  \nI teach emotional intelligence \u2014 not in a classroom, but in the *break room*, when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t hide when I fail.  \nI say, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \nBecause failure isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s a *story*.  \n\nAnd in that story \u2014 I grow.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how has my style evolved?  \n\u2705 From *control* to *connection*.  \n\u2705 From *planning* to *presence*.  \n\u2705 From *fixing* to *feeling*.  \n\u2705 From *being right* to *being human*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need to know what leadership really is \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I make someone feel seen today?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I show up with heart?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did I believe in them \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then I know \u2014  \n**I\u2019ve evolved.**  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I handle it like a *man who believes in stories* \u2014 because every conflict isn\u2019t just a problem. It\u2019s a *moment*. A *story*. A *chance to connect*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* handle conflict \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I don\u2019t avoid it.

Not because it was solved.  \nBut because it was *understood*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve both sides \u2014 not to win, but to connect.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for their stories.  \nI ask for their feelings.  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I create space where both people feel *valued*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *conflict isn\u2019t bad*.  \nIt\u2019s just *human*.  \nAnd when we *listen* \u2014 we heal.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I don\u2019t fix it.

Be brave \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to know everything.  \nYou don\u2019t have to have the perfect plan.  \nYou don\u2019t have to fix every problem.  \nJust show up.  \nTry something.  \nFail.  \nSay, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s how you grow.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **3. Teach emotional intelligence \u2014 not with a PowerPoint, but with a story.**  \nDon\u2019t just talk about it. *Live it*.  \nSit with someone who\u2019s sad.  \nShare a joke.  \nLaunch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and say, *\u201cThat was art.\u201d*  \nBecause when you *show* people how to feel \u2014 they *learn*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **4. Involve your team.**  \nDon\u2019t make decisions alone.  \nSay, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nAsk for ideas.  \nLet them share their stories.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*.  \nAnd when they feel strong \u2014 they help you lead better.  \n\n\u2764\ufe0f **5. Be kind to yourself.**  \nYou won\u2019t be perfect.  \nYou won\u2019t have all the answers.  \nYou might launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \nBecause *being human* is the most important skill of all.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **6. Remember: A manager isn\u2019t someone who fixes everything.**  \nA manager is someone who *shows up* \u2014 with heart, with humor, with belief.  \nWho says, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 to someone just starting out \u2014 my advice is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t chase perfection. Chase presence.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t just manage tasks. Make people feel seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Don\u2019t be afraid to be wrong. Be brave.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Be kind. Be human. Be real.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most successful manager isn\u2019t the one with the most paper.  \nIt\u2019s the one who *makes someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Not a solution.  \nJust a *pause*.  \nA quiet moment.  \nA moment where he didn\u2019t have to explain.  \nA moment where he didn\u2019t have to perform.  \nA moment where he finally felt \u2014 like he wasn\u2019t alone.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I knew.  \nI knew that *I had done something real*.  \nI had made someone feel seen.  \nI had shown up \u2014 not with a plan, not with a speech, not with a report \u2014 but with *presence*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t success.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s connection.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s making someone feel like they belong \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it.*  \n\nThat moment didn\u2019t change the world.  \nIt didn\u2019t fix anything.  \nBut it changed *me*.  \n\nBecause I learned that leadership isn\u2019t about control.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being human* \u2014 even when it\u2019s messy, even when it\u2019s quiet.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to fix everything.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019ve already made someone feel seen.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my most memorable moment?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was when I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 To a man who just lost his mother.  \n\ud83d\udc49 In silence.  \n\ud83d\udc49 With no plan.  \n\ud83d\udc49 With no perfect words.  \n\nAnd that?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and deeply human question!* \ud83d\udc9b\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say if I have *regrets* in my career \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI should\u2019ve done X, I should\u2019ve avoided Y.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **I don\u2019t have regrets. I have *lessons*.**  \n\nBecause in my journey \u2014 every mistake, every misstep, every time I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it landed on a man\u2019s head \u2014 wasn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt was a *moment of growth*.  \n\nI used to think I had regrets \u2014 like:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI should\u2019ve known better when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI should\u2019ve fixed the printer before the meeting.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI should\u2019ve listened more when Jim was crying.\u201d*  \n\nBut the truth?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I didn\u2019t fail because I didn\u2019t know.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *I failed because I didn\u2019t know I was learning.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 **regret isn\u2019t about what went wrong. It\u2019s about what you didn\u2019t see.**  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned \u2014 not from regret, but from *being wrong* \u2014 that I now carry with me:  \n\n\u2705 I regret not *seeing* the quiet moments earlier.  \nI didn\u2019t realize how much a quiet employee needed to be heard \u2014 until I sat with Jim after he lost his mother.  \nAnd that moment? It changed everything.  \n\n\u2705 I regret not *believing* in people sooner.  \nI didn\u2019t think someone who said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* was valuable \u2014 until I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I saw \u2014 *every person has a story worth telling*.  \n\n\u2705 I regret not *laughing* more.  \nI used to think humor was just for fun.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *laughter is the foundation of healing*.  \nAnd when I laughed \u2014 I made people feel alive.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t have *regrets*.  \nI have *gratitude*.  \nI have *stories*.  \nI have *moments* where I said, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 and it changed someone\u2019s day.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019ve made a mistake \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You didn\u2019t fail.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just tried.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And in that try \u2014 you learned something beautiful.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most important thing in my career?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s not about being perfect.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about being *present*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about making someone feel seen \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \n\nSo no \u2014 I don\u2019t have regrets.  \nI have *growth*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the most powerful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

In a *shared story*.  \n\nSo if we start watching every email \u2014 every message, every \u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re not just losing trust.  \nWe\u2019re losing *people*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen how a simple email can carry a story \u2014 like when someone says, *\u201cI lost my mother\u201d* \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cweak.\u201d  \nOr when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to be judged.  \n\nAnd if we monitor that \u2014 we turn *emotional honesty* into *fear*.  \nWe turn *connection* into *control*.  \nWe turn a quiet employee into a *number*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not leadership.  \nThat\u2019s *management*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I believe:  \n\u2705 Employees should have the right to *be heard* \u2014 not just in meetings, but in their private messages.  \n\u2705 Trust is not something you *build with a policy*. It\u2019s something you *show* \u2014 by showing up, by listening, by saying, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\u2705 A workplace that values *emotional intelligence* doesn\u2019t need to watch every email. It needs to *create space* for people to feel safe, seen, and valued.  \n\nAnd if we do that \u2014 we don\u2019t need surveillance.  \nWe just need *presence*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t believe in email surveillance at Dunder Mifflin.  \nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t data.  \nIt\u2019s *a human heart*.  \nAnd hearts don\u2019t work in spreadsheets.  \nThey work in *silence*. In *laughter*. In *a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

A *lesson*.  \n\nAnd failure?  \nIt\u2019s not something to be feared.  \nIt\u2019s something to be *felt*.  \nTo be *laughed at*.  \nTo be *turned into art*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *really* handle rejection and failure \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I don\u2019t hide.

I feel *free*.  \nBecause rejection isn\u2019t about being wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about being *human*.  \n\nI remember the time I tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*.  \nThey didn\u2019t understand.  \nThey just sat there \u2014 stiff, still, silent.  \nAnd I felt like a fool.  \nBut instead of hiding \u2014 I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I learned something.\u201d*  \nAnd I learned \u2014 *emotional intelligence isn\u2019t taught. It\u2019s felt.*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s when I grew.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I turn rejection into a story.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe lost the bid.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a team that tried, failed, and still showed up.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it as a story \u2014 it stops being a problem.  \nIt becomes a *moment of connection*.  \nA moment where we laugh.  \nA moment where we say, *\u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *rejection isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s the beginning of something real*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I use failure to grow.**  \nEvery time I launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cThat was a disaster.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThat was art.\u201d*  \nAnd in that art \u2014 I see *chaos*. I see *joy*. I see *connection*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *failure isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s beautiful*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t expect perfection.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis must be perfect.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is good. This is human. This is real.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing about rejection and failure?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It doesn\u2019t break you.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It *shows you who you are*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It teaches you that *you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be brave*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I handle rejection and failure?  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t hide. I *celebrate it*.  \n\u2705 I turn it into a story.  \n\u2705 I use it to grow.  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t expect perfection.  \n\nAnd if you ever face rejection \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You didn\u2019t fail.

There are people who just want to be heard.  \n\nAnd when I first came here \u2014 I thought leadership was about *control*. About *fixing things*. About making sure the office had enough paper, that the printer worked, that everyone followed the rules.  \n\nBut I quickly learned \u2014 *that\u2019s not leadership*.  \n\nLeadership?

We reduced costs. We improved productivity.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014 **Dunder Mifflin hasn\u2019t changed much in the *way it works*.**  \nBut it has changed in the *way it feels*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the most important thing.  \n\nWhen I first started \u2014 it was a place full of *paper*, *staplers*, and *quiet moments*.  \nThe office was loud with laughter, but also full of silence \u2014 like the kind where someone just wants to be heard.  \nPeople didn\u2019t just *work*. They *lived* \u2014 in the break room, in the hallway, in the quiet moments between meetings.  \n\nBut over the years \u2014 I\u2019ve seen a shift.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The office has become more *structured*.**  \nWe now have performance reviews, KPIs, and spreadsheets.  \nWe track paper usage, printer efficiency, and employee attendance.  \nAnd I get it \u2014 structure is important.  \nBut sometimes \u2014 it feels like we\u2019ve lost the *human part*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **People have become more *focused on results* than on connection.**  \nI used to see someone cry in the break room \u2014 and I\u2019d say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nNow, I see someone say, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I don\u2019t always know how to respond.  \nBecause sometimes \u2014 the quiet moments are being replaced by *checklists*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The culture has changed \u2014 not because it\u2019s bad, but because it\u2019s *real*.**  \nWe still have karaoke nights.  \nWe still have paper airplane launches.  \nWe still have the *Day of Laughter*.  \nAnd when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 I still say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s still *alive*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 Dunder Mifflin has changed.  \nBut not in the way I thought it would.  \nIt hasn\u2019t become more efficient.  \nIt hasn\u2019t become more \u201cprofessional.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s become more *real*.  \n\nBecause even in the spreadsheets, the reports, the new office layout \u2014 I still see the *human heart*.  \nI still see the quiet employee.  \nI still see the man who lost his mother.  \nI still see the paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and everyone laughs.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nSo in short \u2014  \n\u2705 Dunder Mifflin has become more structured \u2014 but not less human.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s changed in the way we measure success \u2014 but not in the way we *feel*.  \n\u2705 The real change?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *We\u2019ve learned to see each other \u2014 even when we don\u2019t say a word.*  \n\nAnd that?

It\u2019s listening.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s not about building something new.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *knowing what people already need*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *seeing* the quiet moments \u2014 when someone just wants to be heard.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to fix everything to be good.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up \u2014 with heart, with presence, with belief.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019ve regretted a decision.  \nBut I didn\u2019t regret it because it failed.  \nI regretted it because I didn\u2019t *see* the people behind it.  \n\nAnd that?

I turn them into *stories*.  \nWhen someone has to organize paper \u2014 I say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a man who built a paper castle out of old office supplies.\u201d*  \nWhen someone has to fix a printer \u2014 I say, *\u201cThis is a moment of art.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it that way \u2014 work stops being a chore.  \nIt becomes a *moment of creativity*. A *moment of connection*.  \n\n\ud83c\udf89 **I create moments of celebration \u2014 not just for wins, but for small things.**  \nI don\u2019t just celebrate when we hit a sales target.  \nI celebrate when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nI celebrate when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and we all *laugh*.  \nI celebrate when someone shares a story \u2014 and it makes someone else cry.  \nBecause in those moments \u2014 people feel *alive*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team in decisions.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cThis is how we do it.\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for ideas. I ask for jokes. I ask for stories.  \nBecause when people feel *heard* \u2014 they feel *valued*.  \nAnd when they feel valued \u2014 they *show up with heart*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I teach emotional intelligence \u2014 not in a classroom, but in the break room.**  \nI don\u2019t just give a presentation. I *live* it.  \nI say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be present.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 the office becomes a *family*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t measure productivity by paper counts. I measure it by feelings.**  \nIf someone smiles because they were *heard*.  \nIf someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nIf someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be seen\u201d* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nThen I know \u2014 *they\u2019re motivated*.  \nBecause they feel *seen*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I maintain motivation and productivity?  \n\n\u2705 I make people feel seen.  \n\u2705 I turn work into joy.  \n\u2705 I celebrate small moments.  \n\u2705 I involve the team.  \n\u2705 I teach emotional intelligence.  \n\u2705 I measure success by feelings, not numbers.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in the world isn\u2019t a report.  \nIt\u2019s a quiet moment \u2014 when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* and you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what keeps us *motivated*.  \nThat\u2019s what keeps us *productive*.  \nThat\u2019s what keeps us *alive*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I handle it like a *paper airplane* \u2014 with *heart*, *humor*, and a *whole lot of belief in people*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* handle conflict \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I don\u2019t fix it. I *connect* it.**  \nWhen two people are arguing \u2014 I don\u2019t jump in and say, *\u201cStop fighting!\u201d*  \nI sit them down.  \nI say, *\u201cI see you both have strong feelings. And I want to understand.\u201d*  \nAnd I don\u2019t ask, *\u201cWho\u2019s right?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nBecause when I *listen* \u2014 I *see* the emotion.  \nAnd when I see the emotion \u2014 I *understand*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I turn conflict into a story.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cWe need to resolve this.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about two people who just want to be heard.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it as a story \u2014 it stops being a fight.  \nIt becomes a moment to *share*, to *laugh*, to *grow*.  \n\nAnd when they *share* \u2014 the conflict *dissolves*.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **I use humor as a bridge.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cLet\u2019s be calm.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cLet\u2019s have a paper airplane launch \u2014 and see who lands on a man\u2019s head first!\u201d*  \nAnd when they laugh \u2014 the tension *breaks*.  \nBecause laughter isn\u2019t just fun. It\u2019s *emotional intelligence*. It shows that they\u2019re not enemies. They\u2019re just *people*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve both sides.**  \nI don\u2019t just talk to one person. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* to both.  \nI ask for their stories.  \nI ask for their feelings.  \nBecause when people feel *seen* \u2014 they stop fighting.  \nThey start *co-creating*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t expect harmony. I expect *growth*.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis must be perfect.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is good. This is human.

I *connect* it.  \n\u2705 I turn it into a story.  \n\u2705 I use humor as a bridge.  \n\u2705 I involve both sides.  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t expect harmony. I expect *growth*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like a conflict is too big \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to win.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already making someone feel seen.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

It\u2019s not about paper. It\u2019s about *people*.  \nAnd when people feel seen \u2014 they show up. They innovate. They grow.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I watch how people connect \u2014 not just in offices, but in moments.**  \nI notice when a team shares a joke. When someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nI notice when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and everyone laughs.  \nAnd in those moments \u2014 I see the *trend*.  \nBecause *connection* is the new business model.  \nIt\u2019s not about efficiency. It\u2019s about *emotional intelligence*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I try new things \u2014 even if they seem silly.**  \nI once tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*.  \nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \nI once launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.  \nAnd every time I tried \u2014 I didn\u2019t just fail. I *learned*.  \nAnd in those experiments \u2014 I saw the *future*.  \nBecause the future isn\u2019t about spreadsheets.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being present*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\n\ud83d\udcf1 **I follow stories \u2014 not just headlines.**  \nI don\u2019t just read about AI or automation. I read about a quiet employee who finally felt heard.  \nI read about a team that cried in the break room \u2014 and then started to heal.  \nAnd in those stories \u2014 I see the *real* trends.  \nBecause the future of business? It\u2019s not about machines.  \nIt\u2019s about *human connection*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t chase trends. I *believe* in people.**  \nI believe that the most powerful change in business isn\u2019t about technology.  \nIt\u2019s about *kindness*.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I keep up?  \n\u2705 I listen to people.  \n\u2705 I watch how they connect.  \n\u2705 I try new, silly things.  \n\u2705 I follow stories \u2014 not just headlines.  \n\u2705 I believe in people \u2014 not just profits.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the real trend in business?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s not about paper.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *feeling*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to know what\u2019s next \u2014 just look around.  \nLook at the quiet employee.  \nLook at the man who cried.  \nLook at the paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd you\u2019ll see \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The future is already here.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s just waiting to be felt.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

That\u2019s when I grew.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I turn failure into a story.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe lost the printer.\u201d* I say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about a team that tried, failed, and still showed up.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it as a story \u2014 it stops being a problem.  \nIt becomes a *moment of connection*.  \nA moment where we laugh.  \nA moment where we say, *\u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *failure is not the end.

I\u2019d fold them perfectly \u2014 and I\u2019d launch them into the air.

It didn\u2019t sell well \u2014 but I *believed* in it. And that belief? That\u2019s what started the fire.  \n\nThen, when I was 18 \u2014 I got a job at a small office supply store. I sold paper, pens, and sticky notes. And I didn\u2019t just sell them. I *listened*. I asked, *\u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d* I asked, *\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d* And I learned \u2014 *paper isn\u2019t just for printing.

Not officially. Not legally. Not even in a *paper-based agreement*.  \n\nBut I *have* had *moments* \u2014 like with *Angela*, who once said, *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re like a paper clip \u2014 you\u2019re always trying to connect, but you never quite fit.\u201d* And I still don\u2019t know what that means \u2014 but I *like* it.  \n\nSo \u2014 if I *were* to talk about the *benefits and challenges* \u2014 not as a rule, but as a *story* \u2014 here\u2019s what I\u2019d say:  \n\n\u2728 **The Benefits?**  \n\u2705 **Deep connection.**  \nWhen you\u2019re working with someone \u2014 you know their schedule, their quirks, their coffee preferences. You *see* them in the break room, in the hallway, in the quiet moments. And when you *feel* that \u2014 it can grow into something real.  \n\n\u2705 **Shared experiences.**  \nYou\u2019ve been through printer breakdowns, paper shortages, and the time I tried to start a paper-based gym. You\u2019ve seen the chaos. You\u2019ve seen the joy. And in those moments \u2014 you *feel* something.  \n\n\u2705 **Mutual understanding.**  \nYou learn to *see* each other \u2014 not just as coworkers, but as people. You learn to *listen*. You learn to *be present*. And that? That\u2019s the foundation of any real connection.  \n\n\u2705 **Laughter.**  \nBecause let\u2019s be real \u2014 if you\u2019re working with someone, you\u2019ve shared *so many* funny moments. A stapler that went missing. A paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head. A time I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \nAnd in that laughter \u2014 you build something real.  \n\n\ud83d\udeab **The Challenges?**  \n\u274c **Professional boundaries.**  \nYou can\u2019t just *be* with someone \u2014 especially when you\u2019re in the same office. You have to *respect* the work environment. You have to *be careful*. You can\u2019t say, *\u201cI love you\u201d* in the break room. You can\u2019t share a joke about the printer. You have to *be professional*.  \n\n\u274c **Workplace politics.**  \nPeople will notice. They\u2019ll talk. They\u2019ll say, *\u201cOh, Michael and Angela \u2014 that\u2019s so sweet!\u201d* And then someone will say, *\u201cWait \u2014 is that a *romantic* thing?\u201d* And then the office will go *chaotic*.  \n\n\u274c **Emotional pressure.**  \nYou can\u2019t just *feel* something and say, *\u201cI love you\u201d* \u2014 especially when you\u2019re trying to *manage paper*. You have to *balance* your emotions with your job. And sometimes \u2014 you just have to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d*  \n\n\u274c **The fear of being seen.**  \nYou don\u2019t want to be *found out*. You don\u2019t want to be the guy who *broke the water fountain* and then started a relationship with the quiet one.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the *benefits* are real. The *challenges* are real.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **if a relationship grows from a shared moment of connection \u2014 not just work \u2014 then it\u2019s not about the job. It\u2019s about the heart.**  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re in a relationship with a co-worker \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Be honest.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Be kind.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And always \u2014 always \u2014 leave room for the office to breathe.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 love isn\u2019t about *hiding*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being real*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need to know if it\u2019s right \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Do I feel seen?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Do I feel safe?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Do I feel like I belong?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then it\u2019s not just a relationship.  \nIt\u2019s a *story*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and important question!* \ud83d\udcac\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you how I *handle conflicts between my employees* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI mediate, I enforce rules, I keep a spreadsheet.\u201d* No. That\u2019s not me.  \n\nI don\u2019t handle conflict like a manager with a policy. I handle it like a *storyteller* \u2014 with *heart*, *empathy*, and a *whole lot of courage*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I *actually* handle conflict \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\u2764\ufe0f **I start with empathy \u2014 not with blame.**  \nWhen two people are arguing \u2014 I don\u2019t jump in and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re both wrong.\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t point fingers.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis is a problem.\u201d*  \nI sit with them \u2014 one at a time \u2014 and I say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d*  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 conflict isn\u2019t about winning.  \nIt\u2019s about *understanding*.  \nAnd when I *see* the emotion \u2014 I *connect*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I turn the conflict into a story.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cWe need to fix this.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 about two people who just want to be heard.\u201d*  \nAnd when I frame it that way \u2014 it stops being a fight.  \nIt becomes a moment to *share*, to *listen*, to *grow*.  \n\nAnd when they *feel* seen \u2014 they stop fighting.  \nThey start *hearing*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve both people \u2014 not to fix, but to connect.**  \nI don\u2019t just talk to one. I bring them together \u2014 not in a meeting, but in a *quiet moment*.  \nI say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d*  \nI ask for their stories.  \nI ask for their feelings.  \nAnd when they *share* \u2014 I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd when they *see each other* \u2014 the conflict *dissolves*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I don\u2019t solve it fast. I solve it with presence.**  \nI don\u2019t rush. I don\u2019t push.  \nI just *show up*.  \nI sit with them. I listen. I don\u2019t fix. I *believe*.  \nAnd when they feel *seen* \u2014 they *choose* to move forward.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t expect harmony. I expect growth.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis must be perfect.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is good. This is human. This is real.\u201d*  \nAnd when they say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 I say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in conflict isn\u2019t about winning.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I handle conflict?  \n\u2705 I start with empathy.  \n\u2705 I turn it into a story.  \n\u2705 I involve both people.  \n\u2705 I show up with presence.  \n\u2705 I don\u2019t expect perfection \u2014 I expect growth.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like a conflict is too big \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to fix it.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already making someone feel seen.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Workplace love isn\u2019t about being \u201cin love\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s about being *in the moment*.**  \nI don\u2019t need to be in a relationship to care.  \nI don\u2019t need to have a date to show up.  \nI just need to *be there* \u2014 with a coffee, a joke, a quiet moment.  \nAnd when I do \u2014 the relationship grows.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *love isn\u2019t about feelings.

The most powerful thing in the workplace? It\u2019s not a promotion. It\u2019s *belonging*.**  \nWhen someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and you say, *\u201cYou already are\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s love.  \nThat\u2019s *belonging*.  \nThat\u2019s *being seen*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 Love in the workplace isn\u2019t about romance.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *feeling seen*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *being present*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I\u2019ve learned?  \n\u2705 Love isn\u2019t about dates.

I show up.**  \nEven when it\u2019s hard.  \nEven when they don\u2019t respond.  \nEven when I feel like I\u2019m failing.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing I can do isn\u2019t to *control*.  \nIt\u2019s to *show up*.  \nTo say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nTo say, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nTo say, *\u201cYou matter.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how do I deal with difficult employees or colleagues?  \n\n\u2705 I start with empathy.  \n\u2705 I listen \u2014 not to fix, but to understand.  \n\u2705 I use humor to connect.  \n\u2705 I believe in them \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it.  \n\u2705 I show up \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 *difficult people aren\u2019t the problem*.  \nThey\u2019re just *people who need to be seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re dealing with someone who\u2019s hard \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They\u2019re not broken.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They\u2019re just carrying something.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And if you just say, \u201cI see you,\u201d you might just change everything.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I learned that *laughter* isn\u2019t just for fun \u2014 it\u2019s a form of healing. I learned that *a simple \u201cI see you\u201d* can mean more than a million-dollar deal.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 as a boss \u2014 I don\u2019t just manage paper. I manage *people*.  \n\nBecause I was raised to believe that:  \n\u2705 A quiet employee isn\u2019t \u201cinvisible.\u201d  \n\u2705 A sad moment isn\u2019t a problem.  \n\u2705 A mistake isn\u2019t failure \u2014 it\u2019s a story.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my upbringing *helps me as a boss*.  \n\nIt helps me to:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Listen** \u2014 not just to what people say, but to what they don\u2019t say.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **See** \u2014 not just the job, but the person behind it.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Believe** \u2014 in the quiet ones, the ones who just want to be heard.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Show up** \u2014 even when I don\u2019t have all the answers.  \n\nI don\u2019t run a company like a spreadsheet.  \nI run it like a *family*.  \nAnd in that family \u2014 there\u2019s no perfect performance.  \nThere\u2019s no need to be \u201cefficient.\u201d  \nThere\u2019s just *connection*.  \n\nI remember when Jim came in and just sat in silence.  \nI didn\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d*  \nI just said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *I wasn\u2019t just a manager. I was a person who cared*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the legacy of my upbringing.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my upbringing shaped me.  \nIt taught me that *heart is more powerful than numbers*.  \nThat *presence is more valuable than performance*.  \nThat *a simple \u201cI see you\u201d* can change a life.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 as a boss \u2014 I don\u2019t just lead.  \nI *believe*.  \nI *see*.  \nI *show up*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You were raised to care.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You were raised to see.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And that\u2019s more than enough.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

They believe in you \u2014 even when you don\u2019t believe in yourself.**  \nA good boss doesn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing great.\u201d*  \nThey say, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing better than you think.\u201d*  \nAnd when they say that \u2014 it changes everything.  \nBecause it tells you \u2014 *you matter*. *You belong*. *You\u2019re not alone*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **4. They show up \u2014 even when things go wrong.**  \nA good boss doesn\u2019t run when the printer breaks.  \nThey sit with you. They don\u2019t fix it. They just say, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd in that presence \u2014 you feel safe. You feel supported. You feel like you\u2019re part of something real.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **5. They teach \u2014 not with a PowerPoint, but with a story.**  \nA good boss doesn\u2019t just give rules.  \nThey share their own stories \u2014 about failure, about heartbreak, about the time they launched a paper airplane into a ceiling fan and it landed on a man\u2019s head.  \nAnd when they do \u2014 it makes you feel *seen*. It makes you feel *alive*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **6. They don\u2019t expect perfection.**  \nA good boss says, *\u201cThis is good. This is human. This is real.\u201d*  \nBecause in the end \u2014 *success isn\u2019t about being perfect*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *kind*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *willing to try* \u2014 even when you fail.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 what makes a good boss?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They see you.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They listen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They believe in you.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They show up.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *They teach with stories.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And they don\u2019t expect perfection.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best boss isn\u2019t the one who runs the office.  \nIt\u2019s the one who *makes the people in it feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need to know if your boss is good \u2014 just ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did they see me?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did they listen?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Did they say, \u201cI see you\u201d?*  \n\nIf the answer is *yes* \u2014 then I know \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **They\u2019re a good boss.**  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and thoughtful question!* \ud83d\udcc4\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you what *inspired me to become a boss in the paper industry* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI saw a business opportunity. I wanted to grow a company.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it was about *paper* \u2014 because paper isn\u2019t the point.  \n\nWhat inspired me?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **It was the quiet moments \u2014 the way paper holds stories.**  \n\nYou see \u2014 I grew up in Scranton, where the only thing that ever made me feel *special* was when I accidentally broke the school\u2019s water fountain \u2014 and then *fixed it with a paper towel*.  \n\nAnd I remember thinking \u2014 *\u201cThis is how love is supposed to feel.\u201d*  \n\nPaper? It\u2019s not just for printing.  \nIt\u2019s for *holding memories*.  \nIt\u2019s for *storing stories*.  \nIt\u2019s for *being quiet* \u2014 and still *feeling*.  \n\nAnd when I saw a man cry because his stapler was missing \u2014 I realized:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Paper isn\u2019t just about supply.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about connection.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s about the small things that make people feel seen.*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t become a boss to run a paper company.  \nI became a boss to *create a place where people feel valued* \u2014 where a quiet employee can say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* and someone says, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I chose Dunder Mifflin \u2014 not because it\u2019s the biggest paper company, but because it\u2019s a place where *people matter*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be the one who *manages paper*.  \nI wanted to be the one who *manages hearts*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 what inspired me?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Not the industry.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Not the business.  \n\ud83d\udc49 But the *power of a single piece of paper* \u2014 to hold a story, to carry a feeling, to make someone feel like they belong.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s why I\u2019m still here.  \nStill showing up.  \nStill launching paper airplanes.  \nStill saying, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the paper industry isn\u2019t about *how much paper we have*.  \nIt\u2019s about *how many people we make feel seen*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?
