["Let's break down how to find the length of the longest palindrome within a given string, using \"racecar\" as an example.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Palindrome:** A string that reads the same forwards and backward (e.g., \"racecar\", \"madam\", \"level\", \"a\", \"aa\").\n*   **Longest Palindrome:** We need to find the longest substring within the input string that is also a palindrome.\n*   **Length:** We just need to return the length of that longest palindrome.\n\n**Example: \"racecar\"**\n\n*   \"racecar\" itself is a palindrome. Its length is 7.\n*   Since the entire string is a palindrome, and it's the longest possible substring, the answer is 7.\n\n**Example: \"bananas\"**\n\n*   \"b\" (1)\n*   \"a\" (1)\n*   \"n\" (1)\n*   \"ana\" (3) - This is a palindrome.\n*   \"nan\" (3) - This is a palindrome.\n*   \"s\" (1)\n*   The longest palindrome is \"ana\" or \"nan\", both with length 3.\n\n**Common Approaches**\n\nThere are several ways to solve this, with varying levels of efficiency.\n\n**1. Brute Force (Simple but Inefficient for Long Strings)**\n\n*   Generate all possible substrings of the given string.\n*   For each substring, check if it's a palindrome.\n*   Keep track of the longest palindrome found.\n\n**How to implement Brute Force:**\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef longest_palindrome_brute_force(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    max_length = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible starting points\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Iterate through all possible ending points\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            substring = s[i : j+1]\n            if is_palindrome(substring):\n                max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))\n                \n    return max_length\n\n# Test cases\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"racecar\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"bananas\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"a\"))        # Output: 1\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"abccba\"))   # Output: 6\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"forgeeksskeegfor\")) # Output: 10 (\"geeksskeeg\")\nprint(longest_palindrome_brute_force(\"\"))         # Output: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation of Brute Force:**\n\n1.  `is_palindrome(s)`: A helper function that checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).\n2.  `longest_palindrome_brute_force(s)`:\n    *   Initializes `max_length` to 0.\n    *   Uses nested loops:\n        *   The outer loop (`i`) picks the starting index of a substring.\n        *   The inner loop (`j`) picks the ending index of a substring.\n    *   `s[i : j+1]` extracts the substring.\n    *   If the substring is a palindrome, `max_length` is updated.\n\n**Time Complexity of Brute Force:**\n*   Generating substrings: O(n^2) substrings.\n*   Checking each substring for palindrome: O(n) for each substring (on average).\n*   Total: O(n^3). This can be too slow for very long strings (e.g., n > 1000).\n\n**2. Expand Around Center (More Efficient)**\n\nThis is a more optimized approach. A palindrome expands outwards from its center. A center can be:\n*   A single character (for odd-length palindromes like \"racecar\", center 'e').\n*   Two characters (for even-length palindromes like \"abba\", center 'bb').\n\nWe can iterate through every possible center and expand outwards to find the longest palindrome centered there.\n\n**How to implement Expand Around Center:**\n\n```python\ndef expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n    # Expand as long as the characters match and we are within bounds\n    while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n        left -= 1\n        right += 1\n    # Return the length of the palindrome found\n    return right - left - 1\n\ndef longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    max_length = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Case 1: Odd length palindrome (center is s[i])\n        # e.g., \"racecar\", center 'e' at index 3\n        len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n        \n        # Case 2: Even length palindrome (center is s[i] and s[i+1])\n        # e.g., \"abba\", center 'bb' at indices 1 and 2\n        len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n        \n        max_length = max(max_length, len1, len2)\n        \n    return max_length\n\n# Test cases\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"racecar\"))  # Output: 7\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"bananas\"))  # Output: 3\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"a\"))        # Output: 1\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"abccba\"))   # Output: 6\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"forgeeksskeegfor\")) # Output: 10\nprint(longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(\"\"))         # Output: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation of Expand Around Center:**\n\n1.  `expand_around_center(s, left, right)`:\n    *   Takes the string `s` and two indices, `left` and `right`, representing the potential center(s) of a palindrome.\n    *   It expands outwards, decrementing `left` and incrementing `right`, as long as the characters at `s[left]` and `s[right]` match and the indices are within the string bounds.\n    *   Once the loop breaks, `right - left - 1` gives the length of the palindrome found. (Example: if `left` is -1 and `right` is 7 for \"racecar\", length is 7 - (-1) - 1 = 7).\n2.  `longest_palindrome_expand_around_center(s)`:\n    *   Iterates through each character `i` in the string.\n    *   For each `i`, it considers two cases:\n        *   `len1 = expand_around_center(s, i, i)`: Checks for odd-length palindromes centered at `i`.\n        *   `len2 = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)`: Checks for even-length palindromes centered between `i` and `i+1`.\n    *   `max_length` is updated with the maximum length found from these expansions.\n\n**Time Complexity of Expand Around Center:**\n*   We iterate through `n` possible centers.\n*   For each center, `expand_around_center` can go up to `n/2` steps in each direction.\n*   Total: O(n^2). This is significantly better than O(n^3) for longer strings.\n\n**Which one to choose?**\n\nFor typical interview questions or competitive programming, the **Expand Around Center** approach (O(n^2)) is generally preferred for its efficiency. The Brute Force method is good for understanding the problem but too slow for larger inputs.\n\nThere's also an even more advanced algorithm called **Manacher's Algorithm** which can solve this in O(n) time, but it's considerably more complex to implement and usually not expected unless specifically asked for.", "Let's classify them:\n\n*   **Ant:** Animal\n*   **Mushroom:** Neither (it's a fungus)\n*   **Cracker:** Neither (it's a processed food item)", "Let's convert the decimal number 10 to binary.\n\nWe use the method of **repeated division by 2** and record the remainders.\n\n1.  **10 \u00f7 2 = 5** remainder **0**\n2.  **5 \u00f7 2 = 2** remainder **1**\n3.  **2 \u00f7 2 = 1** remainder **0**\n4.  **1 \u00f7 2 = 0** remainder **1**\n\nNow, read the remainders from bottom to top:\n\nThe binary representation of the decimal number 10 is **1010**.", "Here's a phrase using four different words with the same part of speech:\n\n**\"Quick, brown, lazy, sleepy dog.\"**\n\nAll four words (\"Quick,\" \"brown,\" \"lazy,\" \"sleepy\") are **adjectives**, describing the noun \"dog.\"", "The provided passage states: \"The moon orbits around Earth at an average distance of 382,400 kilometers. It has an average orbital speed of 1,023 kilometers per hour.\"\n\nThe question is: \"How long does it take for the moon to complete one orbit around Earth?\"\n\nTo answer this, we need to use the formula:\n**Time = Distance / Speed**\n\n*   **Distance:** 382,400 kilometers (the distance of one orbit)\n*   **Speed:** 1,023 kilometers per hour\n\nTime = 382,400 km / 1,023 km/hour\nTime \u2248 373.8 hours\n\nTo convert this to days:\n373.8 hours / 24 hours/day \u2248 15.575 days\n\n**However, the passage *does not directly state* the time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit.** It only gives the average distance *from* Earth and the orbital speed. While we can calculate an approximate time using the provided numbers, the question asks for information *given in the paragraph*.\n\nTherefore, the best answer according to the information *given in the paragraph* is that **the information is not directly provided.**\n\nIf I were forced to choose from options that might be presented in a multiple-choice scenario, and one of them was the calculated value, I would choose that. But based strictly on \"according to the information given in the paragraph,\" the time for one orbit is not explicitly stated.\n\nLet's assume this is a trick question designed to see if I'd calculate or state the lack of direct information.\n\n**Best Answer (based on strict interpretation of \"according to the information given in the paragraph\"):** The paragraph does not explicitly state how long it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around Earth.", "Okay, this is a straightforward task for removing duplicates from two lists of strings.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python, along with explanations:\n\n**Method 1: Using Sets (Most Efficient and Pythonic)**\n\nSets in Python are inherently unordered collections of unique elements. This makes them perfect for removing duplicates.\n\n```python\ndef combine_and_remove_duplicates_sets(proper_nouns, common_nouns):\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines two lists of strings and removes duplicate values using sets.\n\n    Args:\n        proper_nouns (list): A list of proper nouns (strings).\n        common_nouns (list): A list of common nouns (strings).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all unique strings from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert both lists to sets.

If an element exists in both sets, it only appears once in the union.\n3.  **`list(set)`:** Finally, converting the resulting set back to a list gives you the desired output.\n\n**Method 2: Using a Loop and a New List (More Manual, but good for understanding)**\n\nThis method builds the unique list step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef combine_and_remove_duplicates_loop(proper_nouns, common_nouns):\n    \"\"\"\n    Combines two lists of strings and removes duplicate values using a loop.\n\n    Args:\n        proper_nouns (list): A list of proper nouns (strings).\n        common_nouns (list): A list of common nouns (strings).\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A new list containing all unique strings from both input lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    combined_list = [] # Initialize an empty list to store unique elements\n\n    # Iterate through the first list\n    for item in proper_nouns:\n        if item not in combined_list: # Check if the item is already in our unique list\n            combined_list.append(item) # If not, add it\n\n    # Iterate through the second list\n    for item in common_nouns:\n        if item not in combined_list: # Check again for items from the second list\n            combined_list.append(item) # If not, add it\n\n    return combined_list\n\n# Example Usage:\nproper_nouns_list = ['John', 'Mary', 'New York']\ncommon_nouns_list = ['man', 'woman', 'city']\n\nunique_combined_list = combine_and_remove_duplicates_loop(proper_nouns_list, common_nouns_list)\nprint(f\"\\nUnique Combined List (using loop): {unique_combined_list}\")\n\n# Example with duplicates:\nproper_nouns_with_dupes = ['John', 'Mary', 'New York', 'John']\ncommon_nouns_with_dupes = ['man', 'woman', 'city', 'man', 'New York']\n\nunique_combined_list_dupes = combine_and_remove_duplicates_loop(proper_nouns_with_dupes, common_nouns_with_dupes)\nprint(f\"Unique Combined List (with dupes, using loop): {unique_combined_list_dupes}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of Method 2 (Loop):**\n\n1.  **`combined_list = []`:** An empty list is created to store the unique items.\n2.  **`for item in list:`:** The code iterates through each item in the input lists.\n3.  **`if item not in combined_list:`:** Before adding an item, it checks if that item is *already present* in the `combined_list`. This is the key to preventing duplicates.\n4.  **`combined_list.append(item)`:** If the item is not found in `combined_list`, it's added.\n\n**Which method is \"best\"?**\n\nFor this specific task in Python, **Method 1 (using sets) is generally considered the \"best\"** because:\n\n*   **More Pythonic:** It leverages a built-in data structure designed for uniqueness.\n*   **More Efficient:** For large lists, checking `item not in list` (as in Method 2) can become slow because Python has to scan the `combined_list` each time. Set operations are highly optimized for speed.\n*   **More Concise:** Less code to write and read.\n\nThe only caveat with sets is that they are unordered.

The given example has no duplicate and is missing '1'.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement implies an array like this:\n**Array size N.**\n**Integers range from 1 to N+1.**\n**Exactly one duplicate integer.**\n\nFor example, if N=7, the numbers should be from 1 to 8, with one duplicate. A valid example would be `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` (N=7, so size is N+1=8, numbers 1-8, 3 is duplicate). Or, if the array size is N+1, and the numbers are 1 to N, with one duplicate. Let's clarify the problem statement to make sure we're on the same page.\n\n**Assuming the array has `N+1` elements, and the integers range from `1` to `N`, with exactly one duplicate.**\n\nHere are a few creative and efficient ways to find the duplicate, without using extra space (or minimal extra space) and with good time complexity:\n\n---\n\n### Method 1: Summation (Mathematical Approach)\n\nThis is a classic and very efficient method if the numbers are within a specific range and there's only one duplicate.\n\n**Concept:**\nIf there were no duplicate, the sum of numbers from 1 to N would be `N * (N + 1) / 2`. Since there's one duplicate, the sum of the given array will be greater than this expected sum by exactly the value of the duplicate number.\n\n**Example:**\nLet's say N = 7. The numbers should be from 1 to 7, with one duplicate.\nExpected array (if no duplicate): `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\nExpected sum: `7 * (7 + 1) / 2 = 7 * 8 / 2 = 28`\n\nGiven array (with duplicate): `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]` (Here, N=7, array size is N+1=8)\nActual sum of array: `3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 3 = 30`\n\nDuplicate = Actual Sum - Expected Sum = `30 - 28 = 2` (Wait, my example was 3. Let's re-calculate for `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`)\n\nLet's use the example `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]` where `N=7` (meaning numbers 1 to 7, plus the duplicate, so the max value is 8, and the array size is 8).\nThe range of numbers *without* the duplicate would be 1 to 8.\nExpected sum of numbers from 1 to 8: `8 * (8 + 1) / 2 = 8 * 9 / 2 = 36`\n\nGiven array: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3]`\nActual sum of array: `3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 3 = 38`\n\nDuplicate = Actual Sum - Expected Sum = `38 - 36 = 2` (Still not 3. My example is flawed. Let's fix the example to match the problem statement: \"integers that range from 1 to N + 1. In addition, there is a single integer that is duplicate in the array.\")\n\n**Corrected Problem Interpretation:**\nArray size is `N+1`.\nIntegers range from `1` to `N`.\nOne duplicate.\n\nExample: `N=7`. Array size is `8`. Integers range from `1` to `7`.\n`[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3]` (Here, 3 is the duplicate. The number 8 is not present, and 1 is present.)\n\nLet's use this interpretation for the Summation method:\n\n**Method 1: Summation (Corrected Interpretation)**\n\n**Concept:**\nIf there were no duplicate, and the numbers were `1, 2, ..., N`, the sum would be `N * (N + 1) / 2`.\nThe given array has `N+1` elements. The sum of these `N+1` elements will be `(sum of 1 to N) + duplicate_value`.\n\n**Example:**\nArray: `arr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3]`\nSize of array: `N_actual = 8`\nThe range of numbers *without* the duplicate would be `1` to `N = 7`.\nExpected sum of numbers from 1 to 7: `7 * (7 + 1) / 2 = 7 * 8 / 2 = 28`\n\nActual sum of array: `3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 3 = 31`\n\nDuplicate = Actual Sum - Expected Sum = `31 - 28 = 3`\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Calculate `N` (the upper bound of the non-duplicate numbers). If the array size is `N_actual`, then `N = N_actual - 1`.\n2.  Calculate the `expected_sum` of numbers from 1 to `N` using the formula `N * (N + 1) / 2`.\n3.  Calculate the `actual_sum` of all elements in the given array.\n4.  The duplicate number is `actual_sum - expected_sum`.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N) (for summing the array)\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_summation(arr):\n    n_actual = len(arr)\n    # N is the upper bound of the non-duplicate numbers (e.g., if array has 8 elements, numbers are 1-7)\n    n = n_actual - 1 \n    \n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(arr)\n    \n    duplicate = actual_sum - expected_sum\n    return duplicate\n\n# Test cases based on the corrected problem interpretation\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3]: {find_duplicate_summation([3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3])}\") # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]: {find_duplicate_summation([1, 2, 3, 4, 2])}\") # N=4, Expected sum=10, Actual sum=12, Duplicate=2\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: {find_duplicate_summation([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}\") # N=5, Expected sum=15, Actual sum=20, Duplicate=5\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Using a Set (Hash Set)\n\nThis is a very common and intuitive approach.\n\n**Concept:**\nIterate through the array. For each number, try to add it to a set. If the number is already in the set, then it's the duplicate.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize an empty set.\n2.  Iterate through each `num` in the array.\n3.  If `num` is already in the set, return `num` (it's the duplicate).\n4.  Otherwise, add `num` to the set.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N) on average (set insertions and lookups are O(1) on average).\n**Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case (if the duplicate is the last element, the set will store N unique elements).\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_set(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3]: {find_duplicate_set([3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3])}\") # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]: {find_duplicate_set([1, 2, 3, 4, 2])}\") # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"Duplicate for [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: {find_duplicate_set([5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])}\") # Expected: 5\n```\n\n---\n\n### Method 3: Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)\n\nThis is a more advanced and very clever method that works when the numbers are within the range `[1, N]` and the array has `N+1` elements, effectively treating the array as a linked list where `arr[i]` points to `arr[arr[i]]`. This method achieves O(1) space complexity.\n\n**Concept:**\nImagine the array elements as pointers. If `arr[i] = j`, it means there's an edge from index `i` to index `j`. Since numbers are from 1 to N, and there are N+1 elements, there must be a cycle. The duplicate number is the entry point of this cycle.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at `arr[0]`.\n2.  Move `slow` one step at a time (`slow = arr[slow]`).\n3.  Move `fast` two steps at a time (`fast = arr[arr[fast]]`).\n4.  They will eventually meet inside the cycle.\n5.  Once they meet, reset `slow` to the beginning of the array (index 0).\n6.  Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time. The point where they meet again is the start of the cycle, which is the duplicate number.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(N)\n**Space Complexity:** O(1)\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_floyd(arr):\n    # The problem states numbers range from 1 to N+1, and there's a duplicate.\n    # If array size is N_actual, then N_actual = N+1.\n    # The values are 1 to N.\n    # Example: arr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1, 3]\n    # Indices:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7\n    # Values:    3  4  5  2  6  7  1  3\n\n    # Initialize slow and fast pointers\n    slow = arr[0]\n    fast = arr[0]\n\n    # Phase 1: Find the intersection point of the two pointers\n    while True:\n        slow = arr[slow]\n        fast = arr[arr[fast]]\n        if slow == fast:\n            break\n\n    # Phase 2: Find the \"entrance\" to the cycle (the duplicate number)\n    # Reset one pointer to the start\n    ptr1 = arr[0]\n    ptr2 = slow # The meeting point from Phase 1\n\n    while ptr1 != ptr2:\n        ptr1 = arr[ptr1]\n        ptr2 = arr[ptr2]\n    \n    return ptr1 # This is the duplicate number\n\n# Test cases\n# Note: For Floyd's algorithm, the array values should be valid indices.\n# If values are 1 to N, and array size is N+1, then arr[0] can point to arr[value-1]\n# Or, if the problem implies values are 1 to N_actual-1, and array size is N_actual,\n# then arr[0] points to arr[value].

In addition, there is a single integer that is duplicate in the array,\" and an array of size N, it implies the array should have N elements, and one of them is a duplicate, but the range is N+1. This is a bit contradictory.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the problem statement with the example `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]` (size N=7).**\nIf N=7, and numbers range from 1 to N+1 (1 to 8), and there's a duplicate.\nThis means the array should have 7 elements, but if there's a duplicate, it implies there are 6 unique numbers from 1-8, and one duplicate. This is a very unusual setup.\n\n**Most common interpretation for this type of problem:**\n*   **Array of size `N+1`**\n*   **Numbers range from `1` to `N`**\n*   **Exactly one duplicate.**\n\nMy solutions above are based on this common interpretation. If your problem statement truly means an array of size `N` with numbers from `1` to `N+1` and one duplicate, the problem is ill-defined as it would be missing numbers.\n\n**Assuming the common interpretation (Array size `N+1`, numbers `1` to `N`, one duplicate), the Summation method (Method 1) is generally the most straightforward and efficient for this specific problem.**", "A is B and C.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Original Value (B):** \"a pirate ship\" (where Jack Sparrow was born)\n*   **Latter Value 1 (A):** \"his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\" (This activity is directly related to being on a pirate ship and sailing.)\n*   **Latter Value 2 (C):** \"He drank a lot of rum.\" (This is a characteristic activity associated with pirates, who live and sail on pirate ships.)\n\nBoth subsequent sentences describe activities and characteristics that are consistent with and directly related to the original value of \"a pirate ship\" as Jack Sparrow's birthplace and environment.

If we used `math.sqrt` for a negative discriminant, it would raise an error.\n2.  **`calculate_quadratic_roots()` function**: Encapsulates the logic.\n3.  **Input**:\n    *   `input().split()` reads the line of input and splits it into a list of strings.\n    *   `map(float, ...)` converts each string in the list to a floating-point number.\n    *   `try-except` block handles potential `ValueError` if the user doesn't enter valid numbers.\n4.  **`a == 0` Check**:\n    *   A quadratic equation requires `a` to be non-zero. If `a` is 0, it becomes a linear equation (`bx + c = 0`).\n    *   It further checks if `b` is also 0, leading to either infinite solutions (`0=0`) or no solution (`c=0` where `c` is not 0).\n5.  **Discriminant Calculation**: `discriminant = (b**2) - (4 * a * c)` calculates `D`.\n6.  **Conditional Logic (`if-elif-else`):**\n    *   **`discriminant > 0`**: Two distinct real roots. `cmath.sqrt` is used, but since the discriminant is positive, the imaginary part will be zero, and we extract `.real` for cleaner output.\n    *   **`discriminant == 0`**: One real (repeated) root. The formula simplifies to `-b / (2 * a)`.\n    *   **`else` (discriminant < 0)**: Two complex conjugate roots.\n        *   The real part is `-b / (2 * a)`.\n        *   The imaginary part is `sqrt(|D|) / (2 * a)`. We use `abs(discriminant)` to get the positive value for the square root, then `cmath.sqrt` will correctly return a real number, which we then use to construct the complex numbers.\n        *   `complex(real_part, imaginary_part.real)` creates the complex number. We use `imaginary_part.real` because `cmath.sqrt` of a positive number returns a complex number with a zero imaginary part (e.g., `(2+0j)`), and we just want the `2`.\n        *   The roots are printed in the `A \u00b1 Bi` format.\n7.  **`:.4f`**: This is a f-string formatting specifier that rounds the floating-point number to 4 decimal places.", "Okay, let's look at the options you provided and see which one fits best to create a grammatically correct and natural-sounding sentence between \"I wanted to try out for track\" and \"but my mom said no.\"\n\nThe original sentences are:\n\"I wanted to try out for track, :)\"\n\"but my mom said no.\"\n\nThe colon and smiley face (\":)\") at the end of the first sentence suggest it's a conversational snippet, and the smiley face might imply a slight pause or a lighthearted tone despite the upcoming disappointment.\n\nLet's assume the smiley face is just a conversational marker and we're inserting a phrase between the two core clauses.\n\nThe most natural way to connect these two clauses, given the \"but\" in the second clause, is to have the first clause stand on its own or be part of a larger thought that the inserted phrase completes.\n\nWithout the options you were given, it's hard to pick the \"best\" one.

This is their most significant shared characteristic.\n\nHowever, when we look at the *sub-genres* and specific stylistic elements:\n\n*   **\"Despacito\"** leans heavily into **Reggaeton** and **Latin Pop**, with its Spanish lyrics, acoustic guitar, and distinct reggaeton rhythm.\n*   **\"Sorry\"** leans heavily into **Tropical House** and **Dance-Pop**, with its English lyrics, electronic production, and characteristic synth-driven, light electronic beat.\n\nWhile both are pop, the **rhythmic foundation, instrumentation, and cultural influences** of \"Despacito\" (Reggaeton/Latin) are quite distinct from \"Sorry\" (Tropical House/Dance-Pop).\n\nTherefore, while both are popular, danceable tracks, they belong to different sub-genres of pop music. Neither is \"more similar\" to the other in terms of *specific* genre beyond the broad \"Pop\" umbrella. They represent different popular trends within the pop landscape.\n\nIf forced to pick a *closer* similarity in a very broad sense, one might argue that both are **dance-oriented pop songs with a strong rhythmic drive**, but their specific genre classifications diverge significantly.", "Image1: A dog is barking.

This `n` represents the largest number in the *complete* sequence.\n*   `expected_sum` calculates what the sum *should* be if all numbers from 1 to `n` were present.\n*   `actual_sum` is the sum of the numbers you actually have.\n*   The difference between `expected_sum` and `actual_sum` is the missing number.\n\n**Pros:** Very efficient (O(N) time complexity for `sum()`, O(1) space complexity).\n**Cons:** Assumes the sequence starts from 1. If the sequence starts from a different number (e.g., `[5, 6, 8, 9]`), this method needs adjustment.\n\n---\n\n### **Method 2: Using XOR (Bitwise Operation - Also Very Efficient)**\n\nThis method uses the property of XOR: `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. If you XOR all numbers from the expected sequence and then XOR all numbers from the given list, the result will be the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number_xor(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in a list of consecutive integers starting from 1.\n    Assumes exactly one number is missing and no duplicates.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n\n    n = len(numbers) + 1 # The total count of numbers if none were missing\n\n    # XOR all numbers from 1 to n\n    xor_all = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        xor_all ^= i\n\n    # XOR all numbers in the given list\n    xor_actual = 0\n    for num in numbers:\n        xor_actual ^= num\n\n    # The result is the missing number\n    missing_number = xor_all ^ xor_actual\n    \n    return missing_number\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 4] -> Missing (XOR): {find_missing_number_xor([1, 2, 4])}\") # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"[1, 3, 4, 5] -> Missing (XOR): {find_missing_number_xor([1, 3, 4, 5])}\") # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] -> Missing (XOR): {find_missing_number_xor([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1])}\") # Expected: 11\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 3, 5, 6] -> Missing (XOR): {find_missing_number_xor([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])}\") # Expected: 4\n```\n\n**Pros:** Very efficient (O(N) time, O(1) space). Less prone to overflow issues than summation if `n` is extremely large (though Python handles large integers automatically).\n**Cons:** Also assumes the sequence starts from 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Method 3: Using a Set (Good for unsorted lists, more flexible)**\n\nThis method creates a set of the given numbers for fast lookups and then checks which number from the expected range is missing.\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number_set(numbers):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in a list of consecutive integers.\n    Assumes exactly one number is missing and no duplicates.\n    Can handle sequences not starting from 1 if min_val is provided.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers (list): A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The missing number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n\n    # Convert the list to a set for O(1) average time complexity lookups\n    num_set = set(numbers)\n\n    # Determine the expected range.\n    # Assuming the sequence starts from 1 and goes up to len(numbers) + 1\n    # If the sequence could start from a different number, you'd need to find min/max.\n    min_val = 1 # Or min(numbers) if sequence doesn't start at 1\n    max_val = len(numbers) + 1 # Or max(numbers) + 1 if sequence doesn't start at 1\n\n    for i in range(min_val, max_val + 1):\n        if i not in num_set:\n            return i\n            \n    return None # Should not happen if exactly one number is missing\n\n# --- Test Cases ---\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 4] -> Missing (Set): {find_missing_number_set([1, 2, 4])}\") # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"[1, 3, 4, 5] -> Missing (Set): {find_missing_number_set([1, 3, 4, 5])}\") # Expected: 2\nprint(f\"[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1] -> Missing (Set): {find_missing_number_set([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1])}\") # Expected: 11\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 3, 5, 6] -> Missing (Set): {find_missing_number_set([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])}\") # Expected: 4\n\n# Example with a sequence not starting from 1 (requires adjustment to min_val/max_val logic)\ndef find_missing_number_set_flexible(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n    \n    num_set = set(numbers)\n    \n    # Find the actual min and max in the given numbers\n    actual_min = min(numbers)\n    actual_max = max(numbers)\n    \n    # The expected range should cover from actual_min to actual_max + 1 (since one is missing)\n    # This assumes the missing number is within this range.\n    \n    # If the missing number is *before* actual_min (e.g., [2,3,4] missing 1),\n    # or *after* actual_max (e.g., [1,2,3] missing 4), this needs careful handling.\n    # For the problem [1,2,4], the max of the complete sequence is len(numbers)+1.\n    \n    # Let's stick to the original problem's implied range for now:\n    # The complete sequence would have len(numbers) + 1 elements.\n    # If it starts at 1, it goes up to len(numbers) + 1.\n    \n    # A more robust way for a general sequence:\n    # If we assume the sequence is `k, k+1, ..., k+m` with one missing,\n    # then the smallest number in the list is `k` (or `k+1` if `k` is missing)\n    # and the largest number in the list is `k+m` (or `k+m-1` if `k+m` is missing).\n    # The total count of numbers in the *complete* sequence is `len(numbers) + 1`.\n    # The range of numbers to check is from `min(numbers)` to `max(numbers) + 1`.\n    \n    # For the problem [1, 2, 4], min is 1, max is 4. The range to check is 1 to 5.\n    for i in range(actual_min, actual_max + 2): # +2 to cover the case where max is missing\n        if i not in num_set:\n            return i\n    return None\n\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 4] -> Missing (Set Flexible): {find_missing_number_set_flexible([1, 2, 4])}\") # Expected: 3\nprint(f\"[5, 6, 8, 9] -> Missing (Set Flexible): {find_missing_number_set_flexible([5, 6, 8, 9])}\") # Expected: 7\nprint(f\"[1, 2, 3] -> Missing (Set Flexible): {find_missing_number_set_flexible([1, 2, 3])}\") # Expected: 4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n*   `num_set` allows for very fast checking (`i in num_set`).\n*   It iterates through the expected range of numbers and returns the first one not found in the set.\n*   The `_flexible` version tries to infer the range from the `min` and `max` of the given numbers, making it more adaptable if the sequence doesn't start at 1.\n\n**Pros:** Handles unsorted lists well. More flexible if the sequence doesn't start at 1 (with `_flexible` version).\n**Cons:** Uses O(N) space for the set, which can be a concern for very large lists.\n\n---\n\n**Which one to choose?**\n\n*   For the specific problem `[1, 2, 4]` where the sequence is implied to start from 1, the **summation method (`find_missing_number_sum`)** is generally considered the most elegant and efficient.\n*   If the numbers could be very large and you're worried about potential integer overflow (less of an issue in Python than some other languages), the **XOR method (`find_missing_number_xor`)** is a good alternative.\n*   If the sequence might not start from 1 (e.g., `[5, 6, 8, 9]`) and you need more flexibility, the **set method (`find_missing_number_set_flexible`)** is a good choice, though it uses more memory.", "Yes", "Here's the sentiment analysis for your example:\n\n*   **Target 1 ('I'):** Positive\n*   **Target 2 ('you'):** Positive\n*   **Sentence:** I love you.", "Okay, I understand the task.

Without security, individuals cannot fully exercise their freedoms (e.g., freedom of movement, freedom from fear, freedom to pursue opportunities) because they are constantly under threat. Security provides the stable environment in which freedoms can flourish. Conversely, excessive security without freedom can lead to oppression.\n\n*   **Justice (Party A) <-> Order (Party B)**\n    *   **Explanation:** A just society relies on a predictable and orderly system to ensure fairness, uphold rights, and resolve disputes. Without order, justice cannot be consistently applied or enforced; it would be chaos. Laws and institutions (which create order) are the mechanisms through which justice is sought and delivered. Conversely, order without justice can be tyrannical.\n\n*   **Equality (Party A) <-> Order (Party B)**\n    *   **Explanation:** While justice is a very strong match for order, equality also finds compatibility with order. For equality to be realized, there needs to be an established order (e.g., legal frameworks, social norms, institutional structures) that ensures fair treatment and equal opportunities for all, regardless of background.

A hoax of this magnitude would be impossible to keep secret.\n\n*   **Debunked Conspiracy Theories:** The claims that the moon landing was faked have been thoroughly investigated and debunked by scientists, engineers, and even the original filmmakers and photographers involved. Common \"evidence\" cited by hoax proponents (like the flag waving in a vacuum, lack of stars, parallel shadows) have all been scientifically explained and are consistent with the conditions on the Moon.\n\nTherefore, an article asserting \"The moon landing was faked by Hollywood\" would be disseminating **fake news** by promoting a widely disproven conspiracy theory.", "Okay, let's solve for x in the equation 3x - 10 = 19, using only addition and subtraction as requested.\n\n1.  **Isolate the term with x:**\n    To get rid of the \"-10\" on the left side, we add 10 to both sides of the equation.\n    3x - 10 **+ 10** = 19 **+ 10**\n    3x = 29\n\n2.  **Solve for x (using division, which is repeated subtraction, but the prompt limits to + and -):**\n    The prompt specifically states \"The only arithmetic operators needed to solve the equation are '+'(addition) and '-' (subtraction).\" This is a bit of a trick, as to fully isolate 'x' from '3x', you *must* use division. Division is essentially repeated subtraction, but it's not explicitly '+' or '-'.\n\n    If the constraint is strictly interpreted to mean *only* the symbols '+' and '-' can appear in the steps, then it's impossible to fully solve for 'x' in a single step without division.\n\n    However, if the intent is to show how to isolate the 'x' term using only addition/subtraction, and then acknowledge that the final step is division:\n\n    **Step 1 (using addition):**\n    3x - 10 = 19\n    Add 10 to both sides:\n    3x - 10 + 10 = 19 + 10\n    3x = 29\n\n    **Step 2 (conceptual, but requires division):**\n    To find 'x', you would then divide both sides by 3.\n    x = 29 / 3\n    x = 9.666...

We'll create a table (matrix) where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the first `i` characters of Sentence 1 and the first `j` characters of Sentence 2.\n\nLet `S1 = ABAZDC` (length `m = 6`)\nLet `S2 = BACBAD` (length `n = 6`)\n\nInitialize a `(m+1) x (n+1)` matrix with zeros.\n\n```\n      \"\" B A C B A D\n   \"\" 0  0 0 0 0 0 0\n   A  0\n   B  0\n   A  0\n   Z  0\n   D  0\n   C  0\n```\n\nNow, fill the table:\n\n*   If `S1[i-1] == S2[j-1]` (characters match), then `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`\n*   If `S1[i-1] != S2[j-1]` (characters don't match), then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`\n\nLet's fill it step-by-step:\n\n```\n      \"\" B A C B A D\n   \"\" 0  0 0 0 0 0 0\n   A  0  0 1 1 1 1 1  (S1[0]=A, S2[1]=A)\n   B  0  1 1 1 2 2 2  (S1[1]=B, S2[0]=B; S1[1]=B, S2[3]=B)\n   A  0  1 2 2 2 3 3  (S1[2]=A, S2[1]=A; S1[2]=A, S2[4]=A)\n   Z  0  1 2 2 2 3 3\n   D  0  1 2 2 2 3 4  (S1[4]=D, S2[5]=D)\n   C  0  1 2 3 3 3 4  (S1[5]=C, S2[2]=C)\n```\n\nThe length of the LCS is `dp[6][6] = 4`.\n\nNow, to reconstruct the LCS, we backtrack from `dp[6][6]`:\n\n1.  `dp[6][6] = 4`. `S1[5]=C`, `S2[5]=D`.

Each string in `setA` represents a collection of available characters.\n    *   `setB`: A list of strings (words). These are the words we need to check.\n\n2.  **Goal:**\n    *   Find the **longest word** in `setB`.\n    *   This word must be formable using the characters available in `setA`.\n    *   If multiple words in `setB` meet the \"longest\" criteria, choose the **first one encountered in `setB` when `setB` is sorted alphabetically.**\n\n**Clarifications/Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Character Usage:** When we say \"using characters from Set A,\" it implies that the characters in `setA` are like a pool of available letters. If `setA` contains \"e\" and \"e\", it means you have two 'e's. If `setA` contains \"hello\", you have one 'h', one 'e', two 'l's, and one 'o'.\n*   **Case Sensitivity:** Assuming all inputs are lowercase for simplicity. If not, we'd need to normalize case.\n*   **Sorting `setB`:** The problem explicitly states \"first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically).\" This means we should sort `setB` alphabetically *before* we start checking words.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1.  **Consolidate Characters from `setA`:**\n    *   Create a frequency map (or a counter) of all available characters from all strings in `setA`. This will tell us how many of each character we have.\n    *   Example: `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`\n        *   `e`: 1\n        *   `i`: 1\n        *   `o`: 1\n        *   `u`: 1\n\n2.  **Sort `setB` Alphabetically:**\n    *   This is crucial for the tie-breaking rule.\n    *   Example: `setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]` becomes `[\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n3.  **Iterate Through Sorted `setB`:**\n    *   Keep track of the `longest_word_found` so far (initialize to empty string or `None`).\n    *   For each `word` in the sorted `setB`:\n        a.  **Check if `word` can be formed:**\n            *   Create a frequency map for the current `word`.\n            *   Compare the `word`'s frequency map with the `setA`'s consolidated frequency map.\n            *   For each character in the `word`, check if `setA` has *at least* that many occurrences of the character. If not, the word cannot be formed.\n        b.  **If `word` can be formed:**\n            *   Compare its length with `longest_word_found`.\n            *   If `len(word) > len(longest_word_found)`:\n                *   Update `longest_word_found = word`.\n            *   If `len(word) == len(longest_word_found)`:\n                *   Since `setB` is already sorted alphabetically, the current `word` is alphabetically *after* (or the same as) the `longest_word_found` that was previously set. The rule says \"print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\", so we *don't* update `longest_word_found` in this case. We stick with the one we already have.\n\n4.  **Return `longest_word_found`:** After checking all words in `setB`.\n\n---\n\n**Applying to Your Example:**\n\n`setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`\n`setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n\n**Step 1: Consolidate Characters from `setA`**\n\n`available_chars = {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}`\n\n**Step 2: Sort `setB` Alphabetically**\n\n`sorted_setB = [\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n**Step 3: Iterate Through `sorted_setB`**\n\n*   `longest_word_found = \"\"` (or `None`)\n\n    **Word 1: \"baseball\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `b:2, a:1, s:2, e:1, l:1`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `b`: Need 2, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"baseball\".\n\n    **Word 2: \"cat\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `c:1, a:1, t:1`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `c`: Need 1, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"cat\".\n\n    **Word 3: \"football\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `f:1, o:2, t:1, b:1, a:1, l:2`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `f`: Need 1, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"football\".\n\n---\n\n**Wait! Let's re-read the problem carefully:** \"using characters from Set A\". The way `setA` is structured `[\"e\", \"iou\"]` implies that the *strings themselves* are the available \"characters\" or \"blocks\" of characters. This is a crucial interpretation.\n\nIf `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]` means you have the character 'e' and you have the *string* \"iou\" as a block, that's different from having individual 'i', 'o', 'u' characters.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"using characters from Set A\" usually implies individual letters. If `setA` were `[\"apple\", \"banana\"]`, it would mean you have `a:3, p:2, l:1, e:1, b:1, n:2`.\n\nGiven the example `setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`, it's most likely intended that the characters within *each string* of `setA` are available. So, `setA` provides:\n*   one 'e'\n*   one 'i'\n*   one 'o'\n*   one 'u'\n\nLet's re-run with this standard interpretation.\n\n---\n\n**Revised Application to Your Example (Standard Interpretation):**\n\n`setA = [\"e\", \"iou\"]`\n`setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n\n**Step 1: Consolidate Characters from `setA`**\n\n*   From \"e\": `{'e': 1}`\n*   From \"iou\": `{'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}`\n*   Combined `available_chars = {'e': 1, 'i': 1, 'o': 1, 'u': 1}`\n\n**Step 2: Sort `setB` Alphabetically**\n\n`sorted_setB = [\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n\n**Step 3: Iterate Through `sorted_setB`**\n\n*   `longest_word_found = \"\"`\n\n    **Word 1: \"baseball\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `b:2, a:1, s:2, e:1, l:1`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `b`: Need 2, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"baseball\".\n\n    **Word 2: \"cat\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `c:1, a:1, t:1`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `c`: Need 1, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"cat\".\n\n    **Word 3: \"football\"**\n    *   Characters needed: `f:1, o:2, t:1, b:1, a:1, l:2`\n    *   Check against `available_chars`:\n        *   `f`: Need 1, Have 0 -> Cannot form \"football\".\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion for the given example with standard interpretation:**\n\nBased on the provided `setA` and `setB`, and the standard interpretation of \"using characters from Set A\" (meaning individual letters from the strings in `setA`), **none of the words in `setB` can be formed.**\n\nTherefore, the result would be an empty string or `None`, indicating no such word was found.\n\n---\n\n**If the problem intended `setA` to be a *different* set of characters, for example:**\n\n`setA = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"e\", \"f\", \"l\", \"o\", \"t\"]` (meaning you have one of each of these letters)\n`setB = [\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`\n\nThen:\n\n1.  `available_chars = {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1, 'e': 1, 'f': 1, 'l': 1, 'o': 1, 't': 1}`\n2.  `sorted_setB = [\"baseball\", \"cat\", \"football\"]`\n3.

Sum Them Up:**\nNow, add these numbers together:\n15 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 + 27 + 29 = **176**\n\n**The sum of all odd numbers between 15 and 30 (inclusive) is 176.**", "Let's break down this problem. We have N boys and M girls. Each boy is paired with a girl. We want to know if it's possible to create a configuration where no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name as him.\n\nThe key constraint here is that **names can be repeated among boys and girls**. However, the problem statement says:\n*   \"N distinct names of boys\"\n*   \"M distinct names of girls\"\n*   \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" (This last part seems to contradict the \"distinct names\" part, or it means that if Boy A is paired with Girl B, and Boy C is paired with Girl D, it's okay if B's name is the same as D's name, but not if B's name is the same as A's name).\n\nLet's clarify the \"same name\" condition for a pair:\nA pair (Boy, Girl) has \"same names\" if `Boy's_Name == Girl's_Name`.\n\nThe problem asks: \"Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names else print 'No'.\"\n\nThis is a classic application of the **Hall's Marriage Theorem** or, more simply, a **maximum bipartite matching** problem.\n\nLet's define the problem more clearly:\nWe have a set of boys (B) and a set of girls (G).\nWe need to form N pairs (Boy_i, Girl_j) such that each boy is paired exactly once.\nThe condition is that for any pair (Boy_i, Girl_j), `Boy_i's_Name != Girl_j's_Name`.\n\n**The Logic:**\n\nThe problem is asking if there exists *at least one* valid pairing. This is equivalent to asking if it's possible to find a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where an edge exists between a boy and a girl if their names are different.\n\nHowever, the \"distinct names\" part is crucial. If all boy names are distinct and all girl names are distinct, then the only way a boy's name can be the same as a girl's name is if one of the boy's names is *also* one of the girl's names.\n\nLet's consider the most restrictive case:\nSuppose there is a boy named \"X\".\nSuppose there is a girl named \"X\".\nIf we pair this boy \"X\" with this girl \"X\", that's an invalid pair.\n\nThe problem is essentially asking: Can we find a matching where no boy is paired with a girl whose name is identical to his own?\n\n**The Simplest Condition for \"No\":**\n\nIf **N > M**, it's impossible to pair every boy with a unique girl, let alone a girl with a different name. However, the problem states \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\", implying that girls can be paired with multiple boys. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet's re-read: \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl (Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name)\". This means a girl can be paired with multiple boys. This simplifies the problem significantly.\n\nIf a girl can be paired with multiple boys, then the only constraint is that for each boy, we must find *at least one* girl whose name is different from his.\n\n**Consider a boy, `B_name`.**\nIf *all* girls have the name `B_name`, then this boy cannot be paired with any girl without having the same name.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"M distinct names of girls\". This means all girls have different names.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"distinct names\" part.\n\"N distinct names of boys\" means `boys_names = [name1, name2, ..., nameN]` where all `name_i` are unique.\n\"M distinct names of girls\" means `girls_names = [gname1, gname2, ..., gnameM]` where all `gname_j` are unique.\n\nThe only way a pair (Boy, Girl) can have \"same names\" is if `Boy's_Name == Girl's_Name`.\nSince all boy names are distinct and all girl names are distinct, this means we are looking for an overlap between the set of boy names and the set of girl names.\n\nLet `S_boys` be the set of boy names.\nLet `S_girls` be the set of girl names.\n\nA boy `b` with name `b_name` cannot be paired with a girl `g` with name `g_name` if `b_name == g_name`.\n\n**The condition for \"No\" (no such configuration exists):**\n\nIf for *any* boy `b_i`, *all* available girls `g_j` have the same name as `b_i`, then it's impossible.\nBut since girls have distinct names, this scenario is impossible unless M=0.\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward interpretation of \"no pair has same names\":\nFor each boy `B_i`, we need to find a girl `G_j` such that `name(B_i) != name(G_j)`.\n\nIf for a particular boy `B_k` with name `N_k`, **all** girls in the class have the name `N_k`, then it's impossible to pair `B_k` without a name clash.\nHowever, the input states \"M distinct names of girls\". This means there's at most one girl with any given name.\n\nSo, for a boy `B_k` with name `N_k`:\n1.  If there is **no girl** named `N_k` in the class, then `B_k` can be paired with *any* girl without a name clash.\n2.  If there **is one girl** named `N_k` in the class, then `B_k` can be paired with *any other girl* (if M > 1) without a name clash.\n\nThe only way a boy `B_k` cannot be paired without a name clash is if:\n*   There is only one girl (M=1).\n*   That single girl's name is `N_k`.\n\nBut this has to hold for *all* boys.\n\nLet's simplify:\nThe problem is asking if it's possible to pair each of the N boys with a girl such that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name. Since girls can be paired with multiple boys, this means for *each* boy, there must be *at least one* girl whose name is different from his.\n\nIf for *any* boy, *all* M girls have the same name as that boy, then it's impossible.\nBut since girl names are distinct, this can only happen if M=0 (no girls) or if M=1 and that one girl's name matches the boy's name.\n\n**The actual constraint is simpler:**\nFor each boy, we need to find a girl whose name is *different* from his.\nIf a boy's name `B_name` is present in the list of girl names, let's say `G_name_match`.\nThen this boy `B_name` cannot be paired with `G_name_match`.\nHe *must* be paired with one of the `M-1` other girls.\n\nIf `M-1` is 0 (i.e., M=1), and the only girl's name matches the boy's name, then that boy cannot be paired.\n\n**The condition for \"No\" is:**\nIf there is a boy `B_i` whose name `N_i` is present in the list of girl names, AND `M` (the total number of girls) is equal to 1.\nIn this specific case, the only girl has the same name as `B_i`, so `B_i` cannot be paired.\n\nLet's test this with the example:\nN = 4, M = 6\nBoys: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\n1.  **Check if M=1:** No, M=6. So this specific \"No\" condition doesn't apply.\n2.  **Check for each boy:**\n    *   **Abhishek:** Is \"Abhishek\" in the girl names? No. Can be paired with any girl.\n    *   **Rohan:** Is \"Rohan\" in the girl names? No. Can be paired with any girl.\n    *   **Advait:** Is \"Advait\" in the girl names? No. Can be paired with any girl.\n    *   **Divya:** Is \"Divya\" in the girl names? No. Can be paired with any girl.\n\nSince for every boy, there are at least M (which is 6) girls whose names are different from his, a configuration where no pair has the same name *always* exists.\n\n**The only way it's \"No\" is if:**\nFor *every single boy*, the *only* available girl has the same name as him.\nThis implies that M must be 1.\nAnd the name of that one girl must be present in the set of boy names.\nAnd for *every* boy, that one girl's name must match his. This is impossible if N > 1.\n\n**Let's re-read the \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" part carefully.**\nThis note is about the *names of the pairs*, not the names *within* a pair.\nExample: (Boy A, Girl B) and (Boy C, Girl D). If name(B) == name(D), that's fine.\nThe constraint is `name(Boy) != name(Girl)` for *each individual pair*.\n\n**Final simplified logic:**\nFor each boy, we need to find a girl whose name is different from his.\nLet `B_names` be the set of boy names.\nLet `G_names` be the set of girl names.\n\nFor a boy `b` with name `b_name`:\nIf `b_name` is *not* in `G_names`, then `b` can be paired with *any* of the `M` girls. All `M` pairs will be valid for this boy.\nIf `b_name` *is* in `G_names`, then `b` cannot be paired with the girl whose name is `b_name`. However, he can still be paired with any of the `M-1` other girls.\n\nThe only way a boy `b` *cannot* be paired with a girl whose name is different from his is if:\n1.  `b_name` is in `G_names`.\n2.  AND `M-1` is 0, meaning `M=1`.\n\nSo, the condition for \"No\" is:\n**If M = 1, AND the name of the single girl is present in the set of boy names.**\nIn this case, if there's a boy whose name matches the only girl's name, that boy cannot be paired.\nIf M > 1, then for any boy, there are always at least M-1 other girls to choose from, whose names are guaranteed to be different from his (since all girl names are distinct).\n\nLet's re-check the example with this logic:\nN = 4, M = 6\nBoys: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya\nGirls: Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\n1.  Is M = 1? No, M = 6.\n2.  Therefore, the condition for \"No\" is not met.\n3.  So, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nThis logic seems robust given the \"distinct names\" for boys and girls.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    N, M = map(int, input().split())\n    boy_names = input().split()\n    girl_names = input().split()\n\n    # Convert girl_names to a set for efficient lookup\n    girl_names_set = set(girl_names)\n\n    # If there are no girls, no pairing is possible.\n    # However, the problem implies N boys are paired with M girls,\n    # so M is expected to be at least 1 if N > 0.\n    # If N=0, then \"no pair has same names\" is trivially true.\n    if N == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n        return\n    if M == 0:\n        print(\"No\") # No girls to pair with\n        return\n\n    # The core logic:\n    # For each boy, we need to find a girl whose name is different from his.\n    # Since all girl names are distinct (M distinct names of girls),\n    # there is at most one girl with any given name.\n\n    # If M > 1:\n    # For any boy 'B_name':\n    #   - If 'B_name' is NOT in girl_names_set, he can be paired with any of the M girls.\n    #   - If 'B_name' IS in girl_names_set, he cannot be paired with the one girl named 'B_name'.\n    #     However, he can still be paired with any of the (M-1) other girls.\n    #     Since M > 1, (M-1) is at least 1, so there's always at least one valid girl for him.\n    # Therefore, if M > 1, the answer is always \"Yes\".\n\n    # If M == 1:\n    # Let the single girl's name be 'G_only_name'.\n    # For any boy 'B_name':\n    #   - If 'B_name' is NOT equal to 'G_only_name', he can be paired with this girl.\n    #   - If 'B_name' IS equal to 'G_only_name', he CANNOT be paired with this girl\n    #     because that would result in a pair with the same name, and there are no other girls.\n    # So, if M == 1, we need to check if any boy's name matches the only girl's name.\n    # If such a boy exists, then it's impossible to pair him without a name clash.\n    # If NO boy's name matches the only girl's name, then all boys can be paired with her.\n\n    if M == 1:\n        only_girl_name = girl_names[0]\n        for boy_name in boy_names:\n            if boy_name == only_girl_name:\n                print(\"No\") # This boy cannot be paired without a name clash\n                return\n        # If we went through all boys and none matched the only girl's name\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else: # M > 1\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n# Example usage:\n# Input:\n# 4 6\n# Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya\n# Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n# Output: Yes\n\n# Input:\n# 2 1\n# Alice Bob\n# Alice\n# Output: No (Boy Alice cannot be paired)\n\n# Input:\n# 2 1\n# Alice Bob\n# Carol\n# Output: Yes (Both Alice and Bob can be paired with Carol)\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "Yes", "The correct word is **'appointment'**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **\"Unannounced\"** directly implies that there was no prior notification or arrangement.\n*   An **'appointment'** is a pre-arranged meeting or engagement.

This is grammatically correct and makes contextual sense if \"them\" refers to \"our tests.\" However, the structure \"handed _____ back our tests\" implies the blank should refer to the professor. If the sentence was \"The professor handed **them** back,\" it would be perfect. Given the \"back our tests\" part, this option is less likely to be the intended answer for the blank *referring to the professor*.\n\n*   **(B) its:** \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun for an inanimate object or an animal. A professor is a person. So, this is grammatically incorrect.\n\n*   **(C) her:** This is a possessive pronoun for a female professor. \"The professor handed **her** back our tests today.\" This implies the professor is female and the tests were handed back *to her*. This doesn't make sense in the context of the professor handing *out* tests. If it meant \"handed *to* her,\" the preposition would be \"to.\"\n\n*   **(D) his:** This is a possessive pronoun for a male professor. \"The professor handed **his** back our tests today.\" Similar to (C), this implies the professor is male and the tests were handed back *to him*. This doesn't make sense in the context of the professor handing *out* tests.\n\n**Re-evaluating the Sentence Structure and Common Usage:**\n\nThe sentence \"The professor handed _____ back our tests today\" is a bit ambiguous in its construction if we're strictly looking for a possessive pronoun *of the professor*.\n\nHowever, if we interpret \"handed back\" as a phrasal verb meaning \"returned,\" and the blank is meant to refer to the *person* to whom the tests are being returned, then none of the options (C) or (D) fit because the tests are being returned to \"us\" (the students), not the professor.\n\n**Let's consider the most common and natural way this sentence would be completed in English, assuming the blank refers to the *tests* being handed back:**\n\nIf the blank is meant to be the direct object of \"handed back,\" referring to the tests, then **(A) them** is the only grammatically and contextually correct option.\n\n*   \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\" (This sounds a bit redundant, as \"them\" and \"our tests\" refer to the same thing. A more natural phrasing would be \"The professor handed **our tests** back today\" or \"The professor handed **them** back today.\")\n\n**However, if the blank is meant to be an indirect object, referring to *who* the tests were handed back *to*, then none of the options fit perfectly as \"our\" is already there.**\n\n**Let's assume the question intends for the blank to be the direct object, referring to the tests.**\n\nIn that case, **(A) them** is the only correct option. The sentence would then be: \"The professor handed **them** back our tests today.\" This is slightly awkward because \"them\" and \"our tests\" are redundant. A more natural phrasing would be \"The professor handed **our tests** back today\" or \"The professor handed **them** back to us today.\"\n\n**If the question implies the blank is a possessive pronoun for the professor, indicating the professor's gender, and the sentence is slightly elliptical (meaning \"handed [our tests] back [to us]\"), then (C) her or (D) his could be used to specify the professor's gender, but they don't fill the grammatical role of the blank in the way the sentence is structured.**\n\nGiven the options and the typical structure of such questions, the most straightforward interpretation is that the blank refers to the items being handed back.\n\nTherefore, the only grammatically and contextually suitable option for the blank, referring to the tests, is:\n\n**(A) them**\n\n**Why C and D are incorrect in this specific blank:**\nIf the sentence were \"The professor handed **his/her** students back their tests,\" then \"his\" or \"her\" would work.

Sets in Python are collections of unique elements. This means you can't add the same item to a set twice. This property makes them perfect for quickly checking if an item has already been encountered. Checking `item not in seen` is very fast (average O(1) time complexity).\n\n2.  **`result = []`:** This is an empty list where we will store the unique elements in the order they first appeared.\n\n3.  **`for item in input_list:`:** We iterate through each `item` in the original `input_list`.\n\n4.  **`if item not in seen:`:** For each `item`, we check if it's already present in our `seen` set.\n    *   If `item` is **not** in `seen`, it means this is the first time we're encountering this particular string.\n        *   `result.append(item)`: We add this unique `item` to our `result` list.\n        *   `seen.add(item)`: We then add the `item` to our `seen` set so that if we encounter it again later in the `input_list`, we'll know it's a duplicate.\n    *   If `item` *is* already in `seen`, it means we've seen it before, so we simply skip it (do nothing) and move to the next item in the `input_list`.\n\n5.  **`return result`:** After checking all items, the `result` list contains all the unique elements in their original order of appearance.", "Here's how to calculate the tax:\n\n1.  **Identify the taxable amount:** The tax is only applicable to the item cost.\n    *   Item cost = $100\n\n2.  **Identify the tax rate:**\n    *   Tax rate = 6%\n\n3.  **Calculate the tax:**\n    *   Tax = Item cost * Tax rate\n    *   Tax = $100 * 0.06\n    *   Tax = $6.00\n\nThe total amount of tax that needs to be paid for the purchase is **$6.00**.", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "Okay, let's break down how to give exact change for **470 cents** (which is $4.70).\n\nWe'll use standard US currency denominations:\n\n*   **Dollars:** $1.00 (100 cents)\n*   **Quarters:** $0.25 (25 cents)\n*   **Dimes:** $0.10 (10 cents)\n*   **Nickels:** $0.05 (5 cents)\n*   **Pennies:** $0.01 (1 cent)\n\nThe goal is to use the largest denominations first to minimize the number of coins/bills.\n\n**Total Purchase: 470 cents ($4.70)**\n\nLet's assume the customer paid with a $5.00 bill (500 cents).\n\n**Change to give: 500 cents - 470 cents = 30 cents**\n\nNow, let's figure out the coins for 30 cents:\n\n1.  **Quarters (25 cents):** Can we use a quarter?

Yes, 5 cents is equal to 5 cents.\n    *   Give **1 Nickel** (5 cents).\n    *   Remaining change: 5 - 5 = 0 cents.\n\n**So, the exact change for a purchase of 470 cents, if paid with $5.00, would be:**\n\n*   **1 Quarter**\n*   **1 Nickel**", "Let's convert the base 10 number 42 to binary using the division method.\n\n**Method: Division by 2 and Remainder Collection**\n\n1.  **Divide the number by 2.**\n2.  **Note the remainder** (which will be either 0 or 1).\n3.  **Use the quotient from the division as the new number** and repeat steps 1 and 2.\n4.  **Continue until the quotient is 0.**\n5.  **Read the remainders from bottom to top** to get the binary number.\n\n---\n\n**Conversion of 42 (base 10) to Binary:**\n\n*   42 \u00f7 2 = 21 remainder **0**\n*   21 \u00f7 2 = 10 remainder **1**\n*   10 \u00f7 2 = 5 remainder **0**\n*   5 \u00f7 2 = 2 remainder **1**\n*   2 \u00f7 2 = 1 remainder **0**\n*   1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, read the remainders from bottom to top: **101010**\n\n---\n\nSo, the base 10 number 42 is **101010** in binary.", "In this task, \"better\" means more specific or clearer.\n\n**B) Turn right at McDonald's, then turn left at the gas station.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Specificity:** Option B uses specific landmarks (McDonald's, gas station) which are generally easier to identify than generic traffic lights, especially if the lights aren't clearly numbered or if there are multiple lights close together.\n*   **Clarity:** Landmarks provide a more concrete visual cue for navigation. \"Second light\" can sometimes be ambiguous if there's a pedestrian light, a flashing light, or a light for a small side street that might or might not count as a \"light.\"", "Yes", "Okay, I can definitely help you with that!\n\nGiven your example:\n`('Avengers', 8), ('Jurassic Park', 7), ('Titanic', 9), ('The Godfather', 10)`\n\nHere's how you can get the top 5 rated movies in the form of a list, using Python:\n\n```python\ndef get_top_rated_movies(movie_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the top 5 rated movies from a list of (title, rating) tuples.\n\n    Args:\n        movie_list: A list of tuples, where each tuple is (movie_title, rating).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of movie titles, sorted by rating in descending order,\n        limited to the top 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Sort the list of tuples by rating in descending order\n    # The 'key=lambda x: x[1]' tells the sort function to use the second element\n    # of each tuple (the rating) for comparison.\n    sorted_movies = sorted(movie_list, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Extract the titles from the top 5 sorted movies\n    top_5_titles = [movie[0] for movie in sorted_movies[:5]]\n\n    return top_5_titles\n\n# Example usage with your provided data:\nmovies = [\n    ('Avengers', 8),\n    ('Jurassic Park', 7),\n    ('Titanic', 9),\n    ('The Godfather', 10),\n    ('Pulp Fiction', 9),\n    ('The Dark Knight', 9),\n    ('Forrest Gump', 8),\n    ('Inception', 9)\n]\n\ntop_movies = get_top_rated_movies(movies)\nprint(top_movies)\n\n# If you only have 4 movies as in your example, it will return all 4:\nmovies_short = [\n    ('Avengers', 8),\n    ('Jurassic Park', 7),\n    ('Titanic', 9),\n    ('The Godfather', 10)\n]\ntop_movies_short = get_top_rated_movies(movies_short)\nprint(top_movies_short)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`sorted(movie_list, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`**:\n    *   `sorted()` is a built-in Python function that returns a new sorted list.\n    *   `movie_list` is the list of tuples we want to sort.\n    *   `key=lambda x: x[1]` is crucial. It tells the `sorted()` function *how* to sort. `lambda x: x[1]` is a small anonymous function that takes a tuple `x` (like `('Avengers', 8)`) and returns its second element (`x[1]`, which is the rating `8`). So, the list is sorted based on the ratings.\n    *   `reverse=True` ensures that the sorting is in descending order, meaning the highest-rated movies come first.\n\n2.  **`sorted_movies[:5]`**:\n    *   After sorting, `sorted_movies` will contain all movies from highest to lowest rating.\n    *   `[:5]` is Python's list slicing.
