Let's check:\n\nBreak down the string:\n\nIndex:  \n0: G  \n1: e  \n2: e  \n3: k  \n4: s  \n5: F  \n6: o  \n7: r  \n8: G  \n9: e  \n10: e  \n11: k  \n12: s  \n\nSo \"Geeks\" appears at:\n- 0\u20134: \"Geeks\"\n- 8\u201312: \"Geeks\" (after \"For\")\n\n\"programming\" appears at:\n- 20\u201330: \"programming learning\"\n\nSo:\n- \"Geeks\" at index 0\u20134\n- \"Geeks\" at index 8\u201312\n- \"programming\" at index 20\u201330\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find all substrings that contain both keywords.\n\nWe need a substring that contains **both** \"Geeks\" and \"programming\".\n\nWe can consider:\n- From the first \"Geeks\" (0\u20134) to the \"programming\" (20\u201330):  \n  \u2192 substring from index 0 to 30 \u2192 \"GeeksForGeeks is good programming learning portal\"  \n  \u2192 length = 31 characters\n\n- From the second \"Geeks\" (8\u201312) to \"programming\" (20\u201330):  \n  \u2192 substring from index 8 to 30 \u2192 \"ForGeeks is good programming learning portal\"  \n  \u2192 length = 23 characters\n\n- From \"Geeks\" (0\u20134) to \"programming\" (20\u201330): longer than the second\n\nSo the shortest substring that contains both keywords is the one starting at index 8 and ending at index 30.\n\nThat substring is:  \n**\"ForGeeks is good programming learning portal\"**\n\nBut wait\u2014is there a shorter one?\n\nWhat about a substring that starts earlier and ends later?\n\nWe must include both \"Geeks\" and \"programming\".\n\nThe earliest \"Geeks\" is at 0, the latest \"programming\" is at 30.\n\nBut the second \"Geeks\" (at 8\u201312) is closer to \"programming\" (at 20\u201330), so the substring from 8 to 30 is shorter than from 0 to 30.\n\nIs there a substring that starts *after* 8 and ends at 30? Yes, but it must include both keywords.\n\nSo the minimal span is from the **start of the second \"Geeks\"** to the **end of \"programming\"**.\n\nSo the substring is:  \n**\"ForGeeks is good programming learning portal\"**\n\nBut let's check if \"Geeks\" appears in \"ForGeeks\" \u2014 yes, from index 8 to 12.\n\nAnd \"programming\" from 20 to 30.\n\nSo yes, both are included.\n\nNow, is there a shorter substring?\n\nWhat if we start earlier? No \u2014 we need to include \"programming\" at 20.\n\nSo the earliest possible start is 8 (to include the second \"Geeks\").\n\nThe latest end is 30 (to include \"programming\").\n\nSo the shortest substring is from index 8 to 30.\n\nLength: 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 characters.\n\nNow, is there a substring that starts earlier and still includes both?\n\nOnly if it includes the first \"Geeks\" (0\u20134) and \"programming\" (20\u201330). That would start at 0 and end at 30 \u2192 length 31 \u2192 longer.\n\nSo the shortest is from index 8 to 30.\n\nNow, what about reversed order?\n\nWe are told: \"either in order or reversed\".\n\nSo does \"programming\" come before or after \"Geeks\"?\n\nIn the text:  \n\"GeeksForGeeks is good programming learning portal\"\n\nSo \"Geeks\" appears before \"programming\".\n\nBut what if we reverse the keywords?\n\nWe need a substring that contains both \"Geeks\" and \"programming\", in any order.\n\nSo if \"programming\" comes before \"Geeks\", is that possible?\n\nIn the text, \"programming\" comes after the second \"Geeks\".\n\nSo no substring has \"programming\" before \"Geeks\".\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to reverse the order in the text\u2014we just need both keywords present.\n\nSo the substring must contain both.\n\nWe already have one.\n\nIs there a shorter one?\n\nWhat about from index 8 to 20?  \n\"ForGeeks is good programming\" \u2014 does it contain both?\n\n- \"Geeks\" at 8\u201312 \u2192 yes  \n- \"programming\" at 20\u201330 \u2192 only if it ends at 20 \u2192 \"programming\" starts at 20 \u2192 so if substring ends at 20, it includes \"programming\" only if it includes index 20.\n\nSo substring from 8 to 20:  \n\"ForGeeks is good\" \u2192 ends at 20 \u2192 \"good\" \u2192 no \"programming\"\n\nSo \"programming\" is not included.\n\nTherefore, the substring must end at or after 20.\n\nSo the minimal end is 30.\n\nMinimal start is 8.\n\nSo the shortest substring is from index 8 to 30.\n\nNow, extract the substring:\n\nOriginal:  \n\"GeeksForGeeks is good programming learning portal.\"\n\nFrom index 8 to 30:\n\nIndex 8: 'F'  \nIndex 9: 'o'  \n10: 'r'  \n11: 'G'  \n12: 'e'  \n13: 'e'  \n14: 'k'  \n15: 's'  \n16: ' '  \n17: 'i'  \n18: 's'  \n19: ' '  \n20: 'g'  \n21: 'o'  \n22: 'o'  \n23: 'd'  \n24: ' '  \n25: 'p'  \n26: 'r'  \n27: 'o'  \n28: 'g'  \n29: 'r'  \n30: 'a'  \n31: 'm'  \n32: 'm'  \n33: 'i'  \n34: 'n'  \n35: 'g'  \n\nWait \u2014 let's count properly.\n\nThe full string:  \n\"GeeksForGeeks is good programming learning portal.\"\n\nLet\u2019s split it:\n\n- \"GeeksForGeeks\" \u2192 14 characters  \n- \" is good programming learning portal\" \u2192 rest\n\nTotal:  \n\"GeeksForGeeks is good programming learning portal.\" \u2192 let's count:\n\nG e e k s F o r G e e k s   i s   g o o d   p r o g r a m m i n g   l e a r n i n g   p o r t a l\n\nPositions:\n\n0\u201313: \"GeeksForGeeks\"  \n14: space  \n15: 'i'  \n16: 's'  \n17: space  \n18: 'g'  \n19: 'o'  \n20: 'o'  \n21: 'd'  \n22: space  \n23: 'p'  \n24: 'r'  \n25: 'o'  \n26: 'g'  \n27: 'r'  \n28: 'a'  \n29: 'm'  \n30: 'm'  \n31: 'i'  \n32: 'n'  \n33: 'g'  \n34: space  \n35: 'l'  \n36: 'e'  \n37: 'a'  \n38: 'r'  \n39: 'n'  \n40: 'i'  \n41: 'n'  \n42: 'g'  \n43: space  \n44: 'p'  \n45: 'o'  \n46: 'r'  \n47: 't'  \n48: 'a'  \n49: 'l'\n\nSo \"programming\" starts at index 23.\n\nEarlier I said 20 \u2014 that was wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s correct:\n\nAfter \"is good\" \u2192 \"is good\" is at 15\u201321:  \n15: i  \n16: s  \n17: space  \n18: g  \n19: o  \n20: o  \n21: d  \n22: space  \n23: p \u2192 start of \"programming\"\n\nSo \"programming\" starts at index 23.\n\n\"Geeks\" at index 0\u20134 and 8\u201312.\n\nSo to include both:\n\n- Must include \"Geeks\" (at 8\u201312) and \"programming\" (at 23\u201333)\n\nSo the shortest substring must start at or before 8, and end at or after 33.\n\nMinimal start: 8  \nMinimal end: 33 (end of \"programming\")\n\nSo substring from index 8 to 33.\n\nLength: 33 - 8 + 1 = 26 characters.\n\nContent:  \nFrom index 8 to 33:  \n\"ForGeeks is good programming learning\" \u2192 up to \"learning\"\n\n\"learning\" starts at 34 \u2192 so at 33: \"g\" of \"programming\" \u2192 so ends at 33 \u2192 \"m\" of \"programming\"?
