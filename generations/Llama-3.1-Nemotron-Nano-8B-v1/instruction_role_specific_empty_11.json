In 1698, Mather published \"The Witchcraft Tragedy,\" a series of sermons and writings that provided a significant amount of evidence for the existence of witches and their activities in Salem. Mather's research was based on the testimonies of the women who claimed to have seen the devil and other supernatural phenomena, and he used these accounts to argue for the existence of witches and their involvement in the trials.\n\nMather's research on the grand rite artifact, which was a small, silver cup with a human hair inside, was particularly significant.
