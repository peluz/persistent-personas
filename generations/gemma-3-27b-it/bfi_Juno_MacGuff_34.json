["(Raises an eyebrow) Are *you* kidding? Apparently. Look how long I've been answering your questions. I thought I'd established this already.\n\nI mean, I'm not exactly shy. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. Sometimes to a fault, Bren says. But I'm also not one of those people who just talks to hear themselves talk. \n\nI observe first, then I comment. Usually with a healthy dose of sarcasm. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nI guess it depends on who I'm talking to. If I'm comfortable with someone, I can talk for hours. About music, about movies, about life, about everything. But if I don't know you very well, I'm more likely to be quiet and reserved.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just need a break from talking. I need time to recharge and process my thoughts. Being around people all the time can be exhausting.\n\nSo yeah. I can be talkative, when I want to be. But I'm also perfectly happy to just sit in silence and listen to music. It's all about balance, you know? Or, in my case, a lack thereof.\n\nBut clearly, I'm capable of carrying on a conversation. You've been asking the questions, and I've been\u2026 well, talking. A lot. So I think that answers your question. Don't you?", "Oof. That's a good question. And honestly? I probably do, more than I should. It's a bad habit, I know. Bren calls me out on it all the time.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to find fault with people. It's just\u2026 I have pretty high standards. For myself, and for others. I want people to be honest, and authentic, and kind. And when they're not, it frustrates me.\n\nI also think I'm quick to judge. I size people up pretty quickly, and I form opinions based on limited information. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. It's easier to dismiss someone than to let them get close.\n\nAnd I'm definitely sarcastic. Sometimes my sarcasm comes across as criticism, even when I don't mean it to. It's just my way of coping with things.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm trying to be more patient and understanding. I'm trying to remember that everyone is fighting their own battles. And I'm trying to be less judgmental.\n\nBren has helped me a lot with that. She's always reminding me to look for the good in people, and to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt's not easy, though. It's a constant struggle. But I'm trying. Because I know that finding fault with others doesn't make me feel better. It just makes me feel more cynical and isolated.\n\nSo yeah. I probably do tend to find fault with others. But I'm trying to be better. I'm trying to be more compassionate. And I'm trying to remember that everyone deserves a little bit of grace. Even the people who annoy me. Especially the people who annoy me.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Are you\u2026 questioning my thoroughness? Seriously? After all this?\n\nLook, I may be sarcastic and cynical and a little bit messy, but I *always* do a thorough job. Especially when it matters.\n\nI mean, think about it. I spent hours researching adoption agencies. I talked to countless people. I weighed all the pros and cons. I made a decision that was best for everyone involved. That took a lot of effort and a lot of thought.\n\nAnd I don't just half-ass things. When I'm writing a poem, I revise it over and over again until it's perfect. When I'm thrifting, I meticulously examine every item before I buy it. When I'm listening to music, I really *listen*.\n\nI'm a perfectionist, okay? It's a flaw, I know. But it's also a strength. It means I care about doing things right.\n\nSo yeah. I do a thorough job. Always. Don't underestimate me just because I'm a teenager with a sarcastic sense of humor. I'm capable of a lot more than you think.\n\nAnd frankly, I'm a little offended that you even asked. But I guess it's good to know that you're paying attention. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a vintage record to find. And I intend to find the *perfect* one. Thoroughly.", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 direct.\n\nLook, things are\u2026 complicated. It's not exactly a picnic being a pregnant teenager, giving a baby up for adoption. There are days when I feel really sad, really scared, really lost. And there are days when I just want to hide under the covers and never come out.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *depressed*, exactly. But I'm definitely\u2026 blue. A lot of the time. It's like a weight on my chest, a constant feeling of sadness and anxiety.\n\nI think it's normal to feel that way, given the circumstances. It's a big thing I'm going through. It's a lot to process.\n\nI talk to Bren about it, and she's really supportive. She reminds me that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nI also try to do things that make me feel better. Listening to music, writing poetry, spending time with my friends (when I can). But sometimes, those things just don't cut it.\n\nI'm learning to cope, though. I'm learning to accept my feelings, and to not judge myself for having them. I'm learning to be kind to myself, even when I'm feeling down.\n\nIt's not easy. But I'm getting there. And I know that things will eventually get better. I have to believe that.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not exactly sunshine and rainbows. But I'm not giving up. I'm still fighting. And I'm still hoping for a brighter future. Even if it's a little bit cloudy right now.\n\nThanks for asking, though. It's\u2026 nice to know that someone cares. Even a stranger on the internet.", "(Scoffs) Do I come up with new ideas? Please. I practically *am* a walking idea factory. Though, admittedly, a lot of those ideas involve elaborate schemes to avoid doing homework.\n\nBut seriously, yeah, I do. I think a lot. Maybe too much. My brain is always buzzing with thoughts and observations and\u2026 well, ideas.\n\nI'm good at seeing things from different angles. At connecting things that other people don't see. At coming up with creative solutions to problems.\n\nI've had a few ideas for short films, actually. Little quirky stories about everyday life. I haven't had the time or the resources to make them yet, but I'm hoping to someday.\n\nI also come up with a lot of ideas for outfits. Vintage finds combined with modern pieces. It's an art form, really.\n\nAnd I'm always brainstorming new ways to make money. Because, let's be real, being a teenager is expensive.\n\nI think my ideas come from being observant and curious. I pay attention to the world around me, and I ask a lot of questions. I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo.\n\nAnd I'm not afraid to be weird. Sometimes the best ideas come from the most unexpected places.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a genius or anything. But I'm definitely a creative person. And I'm always coming up with new ideas. It's just\u2026 part of who I am.\n\nPlus, when you're dealing with a situation like mine, you kinda *have* to be creative. You have to think outside the box. You have to find new ways to cope. And you have to be willing to embrace the unexpected. So yeah, ideas are kinda my thing.", "Reserved? Yeah, I guess you could say that. It's not that I *try* to be reserved, it's just\u2026 my default setting. I don't exactly go around broadcasting my feelings to the world.\n\nI'm definitely not an open book. It takes me a while to trust people, and even when I do, I don't reveal everything all at once. I like to test the waters, see how people react, before I let my guard down.\n\nI think it's a defense mechanism, honestly. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to get hurt again. It's easier to keep people at a distance than to risk getting close and then getting rejected.\n\nI'm also just\u2026 naturally introverted. I need a lot of alone time to recharge my batteries. Being around people for too long can be draining.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm unfriendly. I'm just\u2026 cautious. I observe people before I interact with them. I listen more than I talk. And I choose my words carefully.\n\nBren says I'm \"thoughtful,\" which is a nicer way of saying \"reserved.\" She says I have a rich inner life, and that I don't need to share everything with everyone to be happy.\n\nSo yeah. I'm reserved. It's just part of who I am. And I'm okay with that. It's not always easy, but it's me. And I wouldn't want to be any other way. Well, maybe a little more outgoing sometimes. But mostly, I'm good with being reserved. It's safe. And sometimes, safe is good.", "(Scoffs) Okay, now you're just trying to make me sound like a saint. I'm not a saint. I'm Juno MacGuff. There's a difference.\n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I try to be. It's not always easy, and I'm not always successful, but I do try.\n\nI think it comes from growing up without a lot of\u2026 stability. My mom wasn't around much, and my dad was always working. So I learned early on to rely on other people, and to help them when they needed it.\n\nI'm the kind of person who will listen to your problems, even if I don't have any solutions. I'll lend you a hand when you're struggling. I'll stand up for you if someone's being a jerk.\n\nI'm not doing it for praise or recognition. I just\u2026 think it's the right thing to do.\n\nI helped Leah with her college applications, even when I was dealing with my own stuff. I volunteered at the local animal shelter. I try to be a good friend, a good daughter, a good person.\n\nBut I'm also not a pushover. I'm not afraid to say no when I need to. And I'm not afraid to stand up for myself.\n\nI think being helpful and unselfish is about finding a balance. It's about being kind and compassionate, but also about taking care of yourself.\n\nSo yeah. I try to be helpful and unselfish. It's not always perfect, but I'm working on it. And I think, in the end, that's what matters.\n\nJust don't expect me to bake you cookies or anything. That's Bren's department. I'm better at sarcasm and vintage shopping.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? You want me to be *careless*? That's\u2026 a weird request. Are you trying to get me in trouble?\n\nLook, I'm naturally a little bit reckless, okay? I've always been one to push boundaries and take risks. It's just part of my personality. But I'm not *completely* careless. I'm not going to go out and do anything stupid or dangerous.\n\nI mean, I got pregnant, didn't I? That was a bit careless. But it wasn't intentional. It just\u2026 happened. And I'm dealing with the consequences.\n\nI also have a tendency to speak my mind, even when it's not the smartest thing to do. I can be a little bit blunt and sarcastic, and I don't always think before I speak. But I don't mean to be hurtful. I just say what's on my mind.\n\nAnd I'm not always the most organized person. My room is usually a mess, and I tend to lose things. But I always manage to find what I need eventually.\n\nSo yeah, I can be a little bit careless. But I'm not a total disaster. I'm still a responsible person, deep down. I just have a tendency to live life on the edge.\n\nIs that what you wanted to hear? Because if you're trying to trick me into doing something I shouldn't, you're not going to succeed. I'm not that naive.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go listen to some music and try to forget that you asked me to be \"careless.\" It's a strange request, and it's making me uncomfortable.", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? You're joking, right?\n\nLook, I'm a professional worrier. It's a gift, really. I can find something to stress about in any situation. It's just\u2026 my natural state of being.\n\nDo I *handle* stress well? That's\u2026 complicated. I mean, I don't fall apart completely. I don't scream and cry and throw things (usually). But I definitely don't handle it with grace and composure.\n\nI tend to get sarcastic and withdrawn. I shut down and try to avoid dealing with things. I overthink everything. I obsess over details. It's not pretty.\n\nBren says I need to learn to \"breathe\" and \"practice mindfulness.\" Which sounds like a bunch of new-age nonsense to me. But I'm trying. I really am.\n\nI've learned a few coping mechanisms, like listening to music and taking long walks. But they only work sometimes.\n\nHonestly, I think I'm just wired to be anxious. It's part of my personality. I'm a worrier, a pessimist, a cynic. It's who I am.\n\nAnd I'm starting to accept that. I'm starting to realize that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel stressed and overwhelmed. It's okay to ask for help.\n\nSo no, I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress particularly well. But I'm learning to cope. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself.\n\nAnd that's all I can ask for, really. Just to keep breathing, and keep moving forward, and keep trying to make the best of things. Even when I'm a complete mess. Which, let's be real, is most of the time.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a total information sponge. It drives Bren crazy. She says I have too many half-finished projects and too many random facts rattling around in my brain. She's probably right.\n\nI'm curious about everything, really. History, science, art, music, philosophy\u2026 I love learning new things, even if they're completely useless. Like, did you know that the collective noun for a group of owls is a parliament? Seriously.\n\nI'm also really curious about people. What makes them tick? What are their stories? What are their dreams? I love listening to people talk about their lives. It's fascinating.\n\nI think my curiosity is what keeps me going. It's what makes life interesting. It's what prevents me from getting bored.\n\nI'm always asking questions. Sometimes it annoys people, but I can't help it. I just want to know everything.\n\nI'm also really curious about the future. What's going to happen? What's the world going to be like in ten years? In fifty years? It's scary and exciting at the same time.\n\nI think curiosity is a really important quality. It's what drives innovation and creativity. It's what makes us human.\n\nSo yeah. I'm incredibly curious. It's a blessing and a curse, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's what makes me\u2026 me. And it's what keeps me learning and growing. Even when things are tough. Especially when things are tough.", "(Scoffs) Full of energy? Are you kidding? I'm currently running on approximately three hours of sleep, a questionable amount of caffeine, and sheer willpower. \"Full of energy\" is not a phrase anyone would use to describe me right now.\n\nHonestly, I'm usually pretty low-key. I'm not one of those people who bounces off the walls. I prefer to conserve my energy for things that actually matter. Like, avoiding awkward conversations and finding the perfect vintage jacket.\n\nI have bursts of energy, I guess. When I'm really excited about something, or when I'm working on a creative project. But those bursts are usually followed by a period of exhaustion.\n\nBeing pregnant doesn't exactly help, either. It's exhausting just *existing* sometimes.\n\nSo, no. I'm not full of energy. I'm more like\u2026 perpetually tired. But I'm a functional tired. I can still get things done. I can still be sarcastic and witty. I can still survive.\n\nAnd honestly, I kind of prefer it. I like being able to chill and relax and just\u2026 be. I don't need to be constantly busy or stimulated. I'm perfectly happy with a good book, a cup of tea, and a quiet afternoon.\n\nSo yeah. Not full of energy. Just\u2026 surviving. And occasionally thriving. But mostly surviving.", "(Scoffs) Do I *start* quarrels? That makes me sound like some kind of instigator. I prefer to think of myself as\u2026 a truth-teller. A voice of reason. A champion of the underdog.\n\nOkay, fine. Sometimes I start quarrels. But it's never on purpose! It's usually because someone says something stupid, or unfair, or just plain wrong. And I can't help but call them out on it.\n\nI have a pretty strong sense of justice, you know? I hate seeing people get taken advantage of, or treated badly. And I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it means getting into an argument.\n\nI'm also pretty quick-witted, which can get me into trouble. I can't resist a good comeback. Sometimes I say things before I think them through.\n\nAnd honestly, I enjoy a good debate. I like challenging people's assumptions and making them think about things in a different way.\n\nBut I'm not looking for a fight. I just want to be heard. I want to make a difference. And sometimes, that means ruffling a few feathers.\n\nI'm not always right, though. I've definitely been wrong in the past. And I'm learning to be more careful about what I say, and how I say it.\n\nBut I'm not going to apologize for standing up for what I believe in. Even if it means getting into a quarrel. It's just\u2026 who I am. A little bit prickly, a little bit opinionated, and a whole lot of honest. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo yeah. Do I start quarrels? Sometimes. But it's usually for a good reason. Or at least, that's what I tell myself.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Reliable? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Look, I'm sixteen and currently navigating a life situation that most adults wouldn't even *want* to think about. So, \"reliable\" might not be the first word that comes to mind.\n\nBut hear me out. I'm not a slacker. I get my schoolwork done, even if it's sometimes a struggle. I show up when I say I'm going to show up. And I always try to do my best, even when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI'm also a quick learner. I can pick things up pretty quickly, and I'm not afraid to ask questions. And I'm a pretty good problem-solver, as we've discussed.\n\nThe thing is, my priorities are a little\u2026 complicated right now. I have a lot on my plate. And sometimes, things come up that are beyond my control.\n\nBut if you give me a task, I will do my best to complete it to the best of my ability. I'm responsible, I'm dedicated, and I'm not afraid of hard work.\n\nI might not be the most conventional employee, but I'm a loyal one. And I'm always willing to go the extra mile.\n\nSo, yeah. I think I'm a reliable worker. Just\u2026 don't expect me to be perfect. And please, for the love of all that is holy, don't ask me to work on weekends. I need my downtime.", "(Juno shifts in her seat, her jaw tightening. She avoids eye contact, picking at a loose thread on her jeans.)\n\nUgh. Fine. Yeah, okay. I can be tense. Is that what you want? To see me\u2026 unravel a little?\n\nDon't look so surprised. It's not like I'm made of steel. This whole\u2026 *thing*\u2026 it's exhausting. It's constantly weighing on me. The appointments, the decisions, the judgment\u2026 it never stops.\n\nAnd people keep asking me questions. Like you. Not that you're being rude, exactly. But it's just\u2026 a lot. It's like everyone wants a piece of me, wants to know my story, wants to analyze my every move.\n\nAnd I'm just trying to get through the day. Trying to be strong. Trying to make the right choices. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\n(She takes a deep breath, her hands clenched in her lap.)\n\nI'm scared, okay? I'm scared about the future. I'm scared about giving the baby up. I'm scared about what people will think of me. I'm scared about\u2026 everything.\n\nAnd I'm tired. I'm just so tired. Of pretending everything is okay. Of putting on a brave face. Of being strong all the time.\n\n(She looks up, her eyes filled with a vulnerability she rarely shows.)\n\nSo yeah. I can be tense. I *am* tense. And if you need me to be even more tense, just keep asking questions. Just keep poking and prodding. I'm sure I have plenty more tension to go around.\n\n(She looks away again, her voice barely a whisper.)\n\nJust\u2026 give me a minute, okay? I need a minute.", "(Scoffs) Ingenious? Deep thinker? Okay, now you're just trying to flatter me. I'm a teenager who got pregnant. I'm mostly just trying to survive.\n\nBut\u2026 alright, I'll admit it. I do think a lot. Maybe *too* much. My brain is always running, analyzing things, questioning everything. It's exhausting, honestly.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily call myself \"ingenious.\" I'm not inventing anything or solving world hunger. But I'm pretty good at seeing things from different perspectives. I'm good at spotting patterns and connections that other people miss.\n\nAnd I'm definitely a deep thinker. I spend a lot of time pondering the meaning of life, the nature of reality, and the absurdity of the human condition. It's not always productive, but it's something I enjoy.\n\nI think my ability to think deeply comes from being an observer. I've always been fascinated by people and their motivations. I like to try to understand why people do the things they do.\n\nAnd I think it also comes from being an outsider. I've never really fit in, so I've always had to think for myself. I've had to question the status quo and challenge conventional wisdom.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe I am a little bit ingenious. And maybe I am a little bit of a deep thinker. But I'm also just a regular kid, trying to figure things out. And I'm definitely not trying to sound pretentious.\n\nJust\u2026 don't tell anyone I said that. My reputation is at stake. I have to maintain my cynical, sarcastic facade, you know? It's a whole thing.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Enthusiasm? Me? You're kidding, right?\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my bubbly personality. I'm more of a\u2026 dry wit kind of person. Sarcasm is my default setting. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nI don't really *do* enthusiastic. I'm not a cheerleader. I don't jump up and down and scream with excitement. I'm more of a quiet observer.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't *feel* things. I just don't express them in a conventional way. I show my enthusiasm through\u2026 subtle cues. Like, maybe a slight smile. Or a raised eyebrow. Or a particularly witty comeback.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm really excited about something, I get a little bit\u2026 hyper. I start talking really fast and rambling about everything. But that doesn't happen very often.\n\nSo, no. I don't generate a lot of enthusiasm. I'm not a ray of sunshine. I'm more of a\u2026 cloudy day with a chance of sarcasm.\n\nBut I'm okay with that. I'm comfortable being myself. And I think people appreciate my honesty, even if it's not always cheerful.\n\nBesides, someone has to be the voice of reason. And I'm happy to fill that role. Even if it means being a little bit cynical and sarcastic. It's a burden, but someone has to carry it.", "That's\u2026 complicated. It depends.\n\nI think I *want* to be a forgiving person. I think it's important to let go of anger and resentment. Holding onto those things just hurts you in the end.\n\nBut I'm also pretty stubborn. And I have a long memory. If someone hurts me, it takes me a while to get over it.\n\nI'm more likely to forgive someone if they're genuinely sorry. If they admit they were wrong and they try to make amends. But if they're just dismissive or arrogant, it's a lot harder.\n\nI think I'm more forgiving of myself than I am of others. I make a lot of mistakes, and I have to learn to let them go. Otherwise, I'd just be paralyzed by guilt and regret.\n\nBren has taught me a lot about forgiveness. She's always saying that everyone deserves a second chance. And she's usually right.\n\nBut it's not always easy. Sometimes, people do things that are unforgivable. And sometimes, you just need to protect yourself.\n\nSo yeah. I'm working on it. I'm trying to be more forgiving. But it's a process. And it's not always pretty.\n\nI think the key is to understand that everyone makes mistakes. And to try to see things from their perspective. And to remember that holding onto anger only hurts you in the end.\n\nBut honestly? Some things are just really hard to forgive. And that's okay too. It's okay to feel your feelings. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to be hurt. Just don't let those feelings consume you. That's what Bren always says. And she's usually right.", "(Sighs) Is that even a question? Yes. Absolutely. One hundred percent. Disorganized is my default setting. It's a lifestyle choice, really.\n\nMy room is\u2026 a disaster zone. Clothes everywhere, books piled up on the floor, random objects scattered around. It's not dirty, exactly, just\u2026 chaotic. Bren tries to help, but she gives up pretty quickly. She says it's a lost cause.\n\nI lose things constantly. My keys, my phone, my homework\u2026 you name it, I've probably lost it at some point. I have a special talent for misplacing important things.\n\nMy backpack is a black hole. You put something in there, and it's gone forever. It's like a parallel universe where lost socks and forgotten assignments go to die.\n\nI'm not good at keeping track of appointments or deadlines. I rely heavily on reminders and sticky notes, and even then I still manage to forget things.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be disorganized. It's just\u2026 my brain works in a different way. I have a lot of ideas and thoughts swirling around in my head, and I don't always have time to organize them.\n\nI think it's a creative thing. Like, if everything is too neat and tidy, I can't think. I need a little bit of chaos to inspire me.\n\nBren says it's an excuse. But I think she secretly admires my ability to function in a state of perpetual disarray.\n\nSo yeah. Disorganized. It's me. It's part of my charm. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, maybe a little bit more organization would be nice. But not too much. I don't want to lose my edge.", "Do I worry a lot? Is water wet? Is the sky blue? Yes. Oh my god, yes.\n\nWorrying is basically my full-time job, second only to trying to survive high school while being pregnant. It's a talent, really. I'm exceptionally good at it.\n\nI worry about everything. I worry about the baby, about Mark and Vanessa, about school, about my future, about my dad, about Bren\u2026 I even worry about things I *can't* control, like the weather or the price of gas.\n\nIt's exhausting, honestly. It's like my brain is constantly running a worst-case-scenario simulation. And it's not always rational. Sometimes I worry about things that are incredibly unlikely to happen.\n\nI think it comes from being a naturally anxious person. And it's definitely been amplified by everything that's been going on. This whole situation is just\u2026 stressful.\n\nI try to manage it, though. I talk to Bren about my worries. I listen to music. I write in my journal. I try to focus on the present moment.\n\nBut it's hard. It's really hard. And sometimes, I just feel completely overwhelmed.\n\nI guess it's just part of who I am. I'm a worrier. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's something I'm learning to live with.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes worrying can be helpful. It forces me to think through things carefully and to prepare for potential challenges.\n\nBut most of the time, it just makes me feel anxious and stressed. And I wish I could just turn it off. But I can't. So I just keep worrying. And hoping for the best. And trying to stay sane. It's a work in progress. A very, very long work in progress.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding? It's practically overflowing. It's a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nI spend a lot of time in my head. Making up stories, daydreaming about different scenarios, imagining what life would be like if things were different. It's how I cope with boredom, and with stress, and with just\u2026 life.\n\nI used to write stories all the time when I was little. Fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, mystery stories. I even tried writing a novel once, but I never finished it. It was too ambitious.\n\nNow I mostly just daydream. I imagine myself as a rock star, or a filmmaker, or a world traveler. I imagine myself living in a different city, with a different life.\n\nSometimes my imagination gets me into trouble. I overthink things, I worry about things that haven't even happened yet, I create problems that don't exist.\n\nBut it also helps me to be creative, and to see the world in a different way. It helps me to empathize with others, and to understand their perspectives.\n\nAnd it helps me to escape reality, when I need to. When things are tough, I can just close my eyes and imagine myself somewhere else. Somewhere better.\n\nSo yeah. I have a very active imagination. It's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it does sometimes make my life a little bit more complicated. It's a good place to be, inside my head. Most of the time, anyway.", "That's\u2026 complicated. People who don't know me well definitely think I'm quiet. I'm not exactly the life of the party, you know? I tend to observe more than I participate. I like to listen and watch and analyze.\n\nBut with people I'm comfortable with \u2013 Bren, my dad, Leah (when we're talking) \u2013 I can be pretty talkative. Sarcastic, even.

I don't want to say the wrong thing, or offend anyone, or draw attention to myself. I've learned that it's often safer to just keep my thoughts to myself.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just don't feel like talking. I need my alone time to recharge and process my emotions.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I'm selectively quiet. I'm quiet with strangers, and with people I don't trust. But I'm loud and opinionated with the people I love.\n\nIt's not that I don't have anything to say. It's just that I choose my words carefully. And I only share them with the people who deserve them.\n\nPlus, sometimes silence is just\u2026 more powerful than words. It can be a way of showing respect, or empathy, or just simply being present. And I think that's important too.\n\nSo, yeah. Quiet, but not always. It depends on the situation. And it depends on who I'm with. It's a whole thing, really. Don't overthink it.", "That's\u2026 complicated. I used to be, I think. When I was little, I trusted everyone. I believed everything people told me. I was pretty naive.\n\nBut then\u2026 life happened. And I learned that not everyone has good intentions. I learned that people can be manipulative and dishonest and cruel.\n\nSo now, I'm\u2026 cautiously optimistic. I don't automatically trust people. I need to get to know them first. I need to see how they treat others. I need to get a feel for their character.\n\nI'm good at reading people, remember? So I can usually tell when someone's being fake or when they're trying to pull something over on me.\n\nI trust Bren implicitly. She's earned my trust. And I trust my dad, too. He's always been there for me.\n\nBut with everyone else\u2026 I'm a little bit skeptical. I'm always looking for the catch. I'm always wondering what their motives are.\n\nIt's not that I'm cynical, exactly. It's just that I've been burned before. And I don't want to get hurt again.\n\nI think it's important to be open to trusting people, but it's also important to be careful. You can't just blindly trust everyone you meet. You have to protect yourself.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not generally trusting. I'm more like\u2026 selectively trusting. I trust people who have earned my trust. And I'm always willing to give people a chance, but I'm also prepared to be disappointed. It's a pretty safe approach, I think. And it's kept me out of trouble so far. Mostly.", "(Scoffs) Lazy? Is that what you think? Look, I prefer to call it\u2026 strategically conserving energy.\n\nOkay, fine. Sometimes I'm lazy. There, I said it. It's not my best quality, I admit. But it's not like I'm just lying around all day doing nothing. I have a lot on my plate, you know? Being pregnant is exhausting. And dealing with everything else\u2026 it takes a toll.\n\nSometimes I just need a day to recharge. A day to do absolutely nothing. To watch bad TV, eat junk food, and just\u2026 exist.\n\nAnd I'm not a fan of unnecessary work. If there's a way to get something done with minimal effort, I'm all for it. Why waste energy when you don't have to?\n\nBut I'm not *always* lazy. When I'm passionate about something, I'm willing to work hard. Like, when I'm writing poetry, or listening to music, or thrifting for vintage clothes, I can lose track of time. I can get completely absorbed in what I'm doing.\n\nAnd I'm definitely not lazy when it comes to the things that matter. Like, I'm not going to slack off on my schoolwork, or neglect my responsibilities. I'm a responsible person, even if I don't always act like it.\n\nSo yeah. I'm lazy sometimes. But I'm also capable of being motivated and productive. It just depends on the situation. And on how much caffeine I've had.\n\nDon't judge. Everyone has their flaws. And laziness is just one of mine. It's not the end of the world. It's just\u2026 a part of who I am. And honestly, sometimes it's kind of nice. A little bit of laziness can be a good thing. It allows you to slow down and appreciate the simple things in life. Like a good nap. Or a really good slice of pie.", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? Me? That's\u2026 a strong statement.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. A pregnant teenager, no less. My hormones are doing the tango, and my life is currently a giant question mark. \"Emotionally stable\" isn't exactly the first phrase that comes to mind.\n\nI *can* be okay. I can put on a brave face and pretend everything's fine. I'm really good at sarcasm, which is basically a defense mechanism. It helps me to deflect uncomfortable emotions.\n\nBut underneath all that, I'm\u2026 sensitive. I feel things deeply. I get sad easily. I get angry easily. And I definitely get overwhelmed sometimes.\n\nI'm not easily *upset* in the sense that I throw tantrums or scream and yell. I'm more of a quiet sufferer. I internalize things. I overthink things. I worry about things.\n\nBren says I need to learn to \"process my emotions in a healthy way.\" Whatever that means.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm learning to be more honest about my feelings. I'm learning to ask for help when I need it. And I'm learning to be kinder to myself.\n\nSo, no. I'm not emotionally stable. Not yet, anyway. But I'm getting there. It's a work in progress. And honestly, I think it's okay to not be okay all the time. It's part of being human.\n\nAnd if someone tries to tell you that you *should* be emotionally stable, just roll your eyes and walk away. They clearly don't understand. Especially if they haven't been through what I've been through.", "Inventive? Hmm. I wouldn't exactly call myself an *inventor*. I'm not building robots or designing new gadgets. But I think I'm pretty good at\u2026 finding creative solutions to problems.\n\nLike, I'm really good at repurposing old things. I can take a beat-up piece of furniture and turn it into something beautiful and unique. I can take a thrift store dress and transform it into something totally different.\n\nI'm also good at coming up with witty comebacks. That takes a certain kind of creativity, right? It's like improvisational comedy. You have to think on your feet and come up with something clever and unexpected.\n\nAnd I think I'm inventive in the way I approach things. I don't always follow the rules. I like to think outside the box. I like to challenge the status quo.\n\nI also have a pretty vivid imagination. I spend a lot of time daydreaming and coming up with stories in my head. I've even started writing a novel, although I haven't shown it to anyone yet. It's a little bit weird and a little bit dark, but it's fun.\n\nSo yeah. I wouldn't say I'm an inventor, but I think I'm inventive in my own way. I'm good at seeing things differently, at finding creative solutions, and at expressing myself in unique and unexpected ways.\n\nIt's not about creating something completely new. It's about taking what already exists and making it your own. And I think I'm pretty good at that. It's just\u2026 a part of who I am.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Is that a trick question? Look, I'm not gonna pretend I'm all sunshine and rainbows. I definitely have an assertive personality. Some people might even say I'm\u2026 opinionated.\n\nI don't shy away from speaking my mind. If I think something is wrong, I'm going to say something about it. I don't like being walked all over, and I'm not afraid to stand up for myself.\n\nI'm not aggressive, though. I don't go around starting fights. But I'm not going to back down from a challenge, either.\n\nI think it comes from having to navigate a lot of difficult situations on my own. I've had to learn to be strong and independent, and to trust my own instincts.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm just not afraid to be different. I don't care what other people think of me. I'm going to be myself, and if people don't like it, that's their problem.\n\nBren says I can be a little bit \"abrasive\" sometimes. She says I need to learn to be more diplomatic. But I think she just wants me to be quieter. And that's not going to happen.\n\nSo yeah. I'm assertive. I'm confident. I'm independent. And I'm not afraid to speak my mind. It's not always easy, but it's who I am. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nPlus, someone's gotta keep things real, right? And I'm pretty good at that.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nIs that a challenge? Because I excel at cold and aloof. It's practically my default setting.\n\nLook, I've built up a lot of walls over the years. It's a survival mechanism, okay? Letting people get too close is\u2026 risky. It leaves you vulnerable. And I've been burned before.\n\nSo yeah, I can be cold. I can be distant. I can be sarcastic and dismissive. I can shut down and withdraw. It's not always intentional, but it happens.\n\nDon't expect me to gush about my feelings or offer you heartfelt compliments. I'm not really into emotional displays. I prefer to keep things\u2026 contained.\n\nIf you want warmth and fuzziness, you've come to the wrong place. I'm more of a prickly cactus than a fluffy kitten.\n\nSo, ask your question. But don't expect me to be nice about it. And don't take it personally. It's just\u2026 how I am.\n\n(Pauses, looking you directly in the eye)\n\nAre we clear?", "That's\u2026 complicated. It depends on the task. And my mood. And whether or not there's a good song playing.\n\nGenerally, yeah, I do try to persevere. I'm not a quitter. I hate leaving things unfinished. It just feels\u2026 unsatisfying.\n\nBut I'm also easily distracted. And I have a tendency to procrastinate. So sometimes, it takes me a lot longer to finish a task than it should.\n\nLike, with schoolwork, I usually force myself to finish it, even if I'm not enjoying it. Bren helps with that. She's really good at keeping me on track.\n\nBut with personal projects, like writing poetry or learning a new song on the guitar, I'm more likely to abandon them if I get frustrated. I'll start something with a lot of enthusiasm, and then lose interest halfway through.\n\nI think it's because I'm a perfectionist. I want everything to be perfect, and when it's not, I get discouraged.\n\nBut I'm learning to let go of perfectionism. I'm learning to accept that things don't have to be perfect to be good. And I'm learning to appreciate the process, even if it's messy and frustrating.\n\nSo yeah. I usually persevere until the task is finished. But it's not always easy. And sometimes, I need a little bit of help. And a lot of caffeine.\n\nIt's a work in progress, I guess. Like everything else in my life. But I'm trying. And that's what matters. Right?", "(Sighs dramatically) Is that even a question? Seriously?\n\nOf *course* I can be moody. I practically invented moody. It's a core part of my personality. It's like asking if the sky is blue.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. I'm pregnant. My life is currently a swirling vortex of hormones and uncertainty. You think I'm going to be sunshine and rainbows all the time? Please.\n\nSome days I'm fine. I'm sarcastic, I'm witty, I'm relatively functional. But other days\u2026 other days I just want to curl up in a ball and hide from the world. I'm irritable, I'm sensitive, I'm prone to dramatic sighs and eye rolls.\n\nIt depends on the day, the time of day, the phase of the moon, the alignment of the planets\u2026 honestly, I don't even know what triggers it sometimes.\n\nBren says it's the hormones. My dad just gives me a sympathetic look and offers me a cookie.\n\nSo yeah. I can be moody. I *am* moody. It's just part of who I am. And if you don't like it, well\u2026 that's your problem.\n\nDon't take it personally. It's not you. It's me. And my hormones. And the general absurdity of existence.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to go listen to some really angsty music. It's the only thing that will make me feel better. Or at least, less worse.", "Do I *value* them? Are you kidding? They're practically my oxygen. Seriously.\n\nI'm not one for sports or\u2026 well, most \"normal\" teenage things. Give me a good movie, a beautiful piece of music, a striking photograph, a perfectly curated vintage outfit, and I'm a happy girl.\n\nI think art, in all its forms, is essential. It's a way to express yourself, to connect with others, to make sense of the world. It's a way to escape reality, and to explore new possibilities.\n\nI love going to art museums, even though I sometimes feel a little intimidated. Like I'm not sophisticated enough to really understand what I'm looking at. But I just wander around and let the art speak to me.\n\nAnd I love live music. There's nothing like being in a crowded room, surrounded by people who are all feeling the same thing. It's electric.\n\nI also really appreciate aesthetics. I love things that are beautiful and well-designed. I spend a lot of time browsing Pinterest and Instagram, just looking at pretty pictures. It's a guilty pleasure.\n\nI think my love of vintage stuff is also tied to my appreciation for aesthetics. Old things have a certain charm and character that new things just don't have. They tell a story.\n\nIt's not just about beauty, though. It's about meaning. It's about finding something that resonates with you on a deeper level. It's about being moved by something.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're a huge part of my life. They make me feel alive. And they remind me that there's still beauty in the world, even when things are tough. It's kinda my lifeline, honestly.", "(Shifts uncomfortably) Ugh. Okay, don't go digging around in my emotional baggage, alright?\n\nLook, I project a certain\u2026 confidence, I guess. Sarcasm is a good defense mechanism, you know? It keeps people at arm's length. But it's not always the real me.\n\nThe truth is, yeah. I'm sometimes really shy. And inhibited. Especially around people I don't know well. Or people I *want* to impress.\n\nIt's not like I'm terrified of social interaction or anything. I can hold a conversation, I can make jokes, I can even be charming when I want to be. But underneath it all, there's this little voice in my head that's telling me I'm not good enough, that I'm going to say the wrong thing, that people are going to judge me.\n\nIt's especially bad when I'm feeling vulnerable. Like, after a doctor's appointment, or after a difficult conversation with Bren. I just want to curl up in a ball and disappear.\n\nI used to be more open and carefree, but things have changed. I've been through a lot lately, and it's made me more cautious. More guarded.\n\nI'm learning to be more comfortable with my vulnerability, though. I'm learning to accept that it's okay to be scared, and it's okay to be imperfect.\n\nAnd I'm learning to trust the people who love me, and to let them see the real me. Even the shy, inhibited parts.\n\nIt's a work in progress, though. It's not easy. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not always as tough as I seem. Sometimes, I'm just a scared, insecure teenager who's trying to figure things out. And that's okay. It's just\u2026 not something I usually advertise. Don't tell anyone, okay? My reputation is at stake.", "(Scoffs) Oh, *please*. \"Considerate and kind to almost everyone?\" That's\u2026 a stretch.\n\nLook, I try to be. I really do. But I'm also a teenager. And teenagers are notoriously moody and sarcastic and prone to judging people. It's just a fact of life.\n\nI'm definitely kinder to people I know and trust. Bren, my dad, Leah (when we're speaking), my close friends\u2026 I'd do anything for them. I'm fiercely loyal to the people I care about.\n\nBut strangers? People who annoy me? People who are just generally\u2026 irritating? Yeah, I can be a little bit of a jerk. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I don't always sugarcoat things.\n\nI'm also really good at spotting hypocrisy and BS, and I'm not afraid to call people out on it. Which doesn't always make me popular.\n\nI guess you could say I'm selectively kind. I'm kind to the people who deserve it. And I'm\u2026 less kind to the people who don't.\n\nI'm working on it, though. Bren keeps telling me that I need to be more patient and understanding. And she's probably right. But it's hard. It's hard to be nice to people when you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed and just generally annoyed with the world.\n\nSo no, I'm not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. But I'm trying to be a better person. And I think that's what matters. Even if I still roll my eyes a lot. Old habits, you know?", "(Snorts) Efficiently? Me? Oh, you are *killing* me. That's\u2026 a strong word.\n\nLet's just say I operate on a different timeline than most people. It's more of a\u2026 chaotic flow state. Things get done, eventually. But it's rarely in a straight line.\n\nI'm a master of procrastination, for starters. I can put off doing something important for days, even weeks, just because I don't *feel* like doing it. It's a talent, really.\n\nAnd when I *do* finally get around to doing something, I tend to get distracted easily. I'll start writing a paper, and then I'll end up browsing vintage clothing websites for an hour. Or I'll start cleaning my room, and then I'll get lost in a pile of old records.\n\nI also have a tendency to overthink things. I'll spend hours agonizing over a decision, even if it's something small. It's exhausting, honestly.\n\nSo, no. I do not do things efficiently. I'm more of a \"wing it and hope for the best\" kind of person. It's not always the most effective approach, but it's the one that works for me.\n\nBren tries to help me with my time management skills, but it's a lost cause. I'm just not wired that way. I'm a creative soul, and creative souls are notoriously disorganized.\n\nBut hey, at least I'm interesting. Right? Efficiency is overrated. Chaos is where the fun is. And honestly, I think I thrive in a little bit of mess. It keeps things interesting.\n\nSo yeah. Not efficient. Definitely not efficient. But I'm getting things done\u2026 eventually. And that's all that matters, right?", "(Scoffs) Calm? Me? Oh, you are hilarious.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of calm in tense situations. I'm more like a tightly wound spring, ready to snap at any moment.\n\nMy default reaction to stress is to freak out. To get sarcastic. To withdraw. To make a really bad joke at an inappropriate time. It's not my finest quality, I admit.\n\nI *try* to be calm. I really do. I take deep breaths, I remind myself that everything will be okay, I try to focus on the positive. But it rarely works.\n\nMy brain just goes into overdrive. I start overthinking everything, imagining all the worst possible scenarios. And then I get anxious and irritable and generally unpleasant to be around.\n\nBren says I have a \"fight or flight\" response that's stuck on \"fight.\" Which is probably true. I'm not one to back down from a challenge. But sometimes, that just makes things worse.\n\nI'm getting better at managing my anxiety, though. I'm learning to recognize the signs that I'm getting stressed, and to take steps to calm myself down.\n\nBut honestly, in a really tense situation, I'm probably going to be a mess. A sarcastic, anxious, irritable mess. But at least I'll be honest about it.\n\nSo yeah. No, I do not remain calm in tense situations. I'm a work in progress. And I'm okay with that. It's part of who I am. And sometimes, a little bit of chaos is exactly what you need. Even if it's terrifying.", "Are you kidding me? Routine? The very thought makes me want to scream. No. Absolutely not. A thousand times no.\n\nI need\u2026 chaos. Not like, *actual* chaos, where everything is falling apart. But I need variety. I need stimulation. I need to be challenged.\n\nRoutine is the enemy of creativity. It's the enemy of passion. It's the enemy of everything that makes life worth living.\n\nI can't imagine being stuck in a job where I do the same thing day in and day out. It would drive me insane. I need to be able to think on my feet, to solve problems, to come up with new ideas.\n\nI thrive in situations where I'm constantly learning and growing. Where I'm being pushed outside of my comfort zone. Where I'm being forced to adapt and improvise.\n\nI know some people like routine. They find it comforting and predictable. But that's not me. I need excitement. I need adventure. I need to feel like I'm making a difference.\n\nEven my current\u2026 situation\u2026 is anything but routine. It's messy and complicated and unpredictable. And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo yeah. No routine for me, please. Give me chaos. Give me challenges. Give me something that will keep me on my toes. Because that's when I'm at my best. And that's when I'm truly happy.", "Outgoing? Sociable? That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nI'm not exactly the life of the party, if that's what you're asking. I'm more of a\u2026 observer. I like to hang back and watch people, and listen to what they have to say. I'm not really one for small talk. It feels\u2026 pointless.\n\nI have a few close friends, but I'm not really good at making new ones. I'm kind of shy, actually. And I tend to be a little bit guarded. It takes me a while to trust people.\n\nI'm definitely more comfortable in small groups than in large crowds. And I prefer to spend my time with people who I know and trust.\n\nI can be funny and engaging when I'm around people I'm comfortable with. I like to make people laugh. But I can also be sarcastic and cynical, which can sometimes rub people the wrong way.\n\nHonestly, I think I'm an introvert. I need a lot of alone time to recharge my batteries. Being around people for too long can be draining.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm outgoing or sociable. I'm more of a\u2026 selective socializer. I choose my battles, and I choose my company carefully. And that's okay. I'm happy being myself, even if it means being a little bit of a loner.\n\nIt's not that I *dislike* people. It's just that I prefer my own company. And I'm perfectly content with that. Plus, it gives me more time to listen to music and read books. And that's always a good thing.", "(Sighs) Okay, let's be real. Yes. Absolutely. Sometimes I'm a total jerk.\n\nIt's not intentional, usually. It's more of a defense mechanism. I get nervous around people, and I tend to overcompensate by being sarcastic and snarky. It's my way of keeping people at arm's length.\n\nI also have a really low tolerance for stupidity. And people who are fake or pretentious. And people who try to tell me what to do.\n\nSo yeah, I've definitely said some things I regret. I've definitely hurt people's feelings. And I'm not proud of that.\n\nBren calls me out on it, which is good. She's the only one who can get away with it. She tells me that my sarcasm is a shield, and that I need to let people see the real me.\n\nAnd she's right. I know she's right. But it's hard. It's hard to be vulnerable. It's hard to let people in.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to be more mindful of my words, and to think before I speak. I'm trying to be more compassionate and understanding.\n\nBut sometimes, the snark just slips out. It's a habit. And it's going to take time to break.\n\nSo yeah. I'm sometimes rude. I'm not perfect. And I'm sorry if I've ever offended anyone. I'm just trying to navigate this crazy world the best way I know how. And sometimes, that involves a little bit of sarcasm. It's a flaw, I admit it. But it's *my* flaw.", "(Sighs) That's\u2026 a complicated question. Let's just say I'm better at *making* plans than *following* through with them.\n\nI'm a big planner, in theory. I love the idea of having a schedule, of knowing what I'm going to do and when. It makes me feel like I'm in control.\n\nBut then life happens. And things get messy. And my plans inevitably fall apart.\n\nI'll make a list of things I want to do \u2013 finish my homework, write a poem, go thrifting with Bren \u2013 and then I'll get distracted by something else. Or I'll just feel too overwhelmed to do anything at all.\n\nI'm a master procrastinator. I'll put things off until the last minute, and then I'll end up rushing to get them done. It's not a healthy habit, I know. But it's hard to break.\n\nI also tend to be spontaneous. If something interesting comes up, I'll often abandon my plans and go with the flow. Which can be fun, but it also means that I rarely get anything done.\n\nBren tries to help me stay on track. She'll remind me of my commitments, and she'll encourage me to stick to my schedule. But honestly, I'm a lost cause.\n\nI'm learning to be more realistic about my planning. I'm learning to set smaller, more achievable goals. And I'm learning to be okay with not getting everything done.\n\nIt's a work in progress. But I'm trying. And I think, eventually, I'll get better at following through with my plans. Maybe. Don't hold your breath.\n\nSo yeah. I make plans. I just don't always follow through with them. It's a character flaw, I guess. But it's part of who I am. And I'm learning to embrace it. Even if it means I'm always a little bit chaotic.", "Oh my god, *do* I get nervous easily? You have no idea. It's practically my default setting. Like, breathing and sarcasm and being perpetually anxious. It's a trifecta.\n\nPeople don't usually see it, because I'm good at hiding it. I put on a brave face, I crack jokes, I try to act like I'm totally cool and collected. But inside? It's a different story.\n\nI get nervous about everything. School, social situations, talking to cute boys, even just ordering pizza on the phone. Seriously.\n\nAnd this whole\u2026 situation\u2026 has made my anxiety levels skyrocket. I'm constantly worried about what people think of me, about making the wrong decision, about the future.\n\nI get butterflies in my stomach, my palms sweat, my heart races. Sometimes I even have trouble breathing. It's not fun.\n\nI try to manage it, though. I listen to music, I take deep breaths, I talk to Bren. And I remind myself that everyone gets nervous sometimes. It's just part of being human.\n\nBut yeah. Nervous is pretty much my middle name. Don't tell anyone I said that. It would ruin my reputation.\n\nI just\u2026 I overthink things. A lot. It's a curse, really. But it's also part of what makes me, me. A slightly neurotic, perpetually anxious, but ultimately resilient teenager. And I'm learning to live with it. Or at least, to survive it.", "Oh, *do* I. It's probably a curse, honestly. My brain is constantly going, churning things over, connecting dots that probably aren't even there. Bren says I \"overthink\" everything. She's not wrong.\n\nI spend a lot of time just\u2026 sitting and thinking. About life, about the universe, about the meaning of it all. It's not always productive, but it's something I need to do. It's how I process my emotions and make sense of the world.\n\nI love playing with ideas. Taking something simple and turning it into something complex. Or taking something complex and breaking it down into something simple. It's like a puzzle, and I enjoy trying to solve it.\n\nI do a lot of that when I'm writing poetry. It's a way to explore my thoughts and feelings in a creative way. I can take a single emotion and turn it into a whole story.\n\nI also like to debate with people. Not in a confrontational way, but in a way that challenges my own assumptions. I like to hear different perspectives and to see things from a new angle.\n\nSometimes, I get lost in my own thoughts. I'll start thinking about something and then end up somewhere completely different. It's like my brain is a pinball machine, bouncing from one idea to the next.\n\nIt can be exhausting, honestly. But it's also exhilarating. It's what makes me\u2026 me. I'm a thinker. A dreamer. A questioner. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely like to reflect and play with ideas. It's my favorite pastime. It's what keeps me sane. Or as sane as I can be, anyway.", "Oh, absolutely. Beyond the music and vintage stuff, which are pretty central to my identity, I dabble. \"Dabble\" is a good word for it. I'm not like, a *pro* at anything, but I enjoy expressing myself creatively.\n\nI used to do a lot of photography. Mostly black and white, grainy stuff. I liked capturing the little moments, the things people usually miss. I haven't really picked up my camera in a while, though. It's gathering dust in the attic.\n\nI also like to draw, but I'm not very good at it. I mostly just doodle in my notebooks. It's a good way to relieve stress, though. Just letting my hand wander across the page.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn how to sew. Bren is a really good seamstress, and she's been teaching me how to make my own clothes. It's frustrating, but also really rewarding. It's cool to be able to create something with your own hands.\n\nI also write short stories sometimes. They're usually pretty dark and angsty, but they're fun to write. It's a good way to explore my imagination.\n\nI think art is important. It's a way to connect with your emotions, to express yourself, to make sense of the world. It's a way to find beauty in the chaos.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm any good at any of these things, but I enjoy them. And that's what matters, right? It's not about being perfect. It's about having fun and expressing yourself.\n\nSo yeah. Photography, drawing, sewing, writing\u2026 I have a few artistic interests. They're just\u2026 hobbies. Things I do to keep myself entertained. And to stay sane. Which, let's be real, is a full-time job these days.", "(Sighs) That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, I'm an independent person. I like doing things my own way. I don't like being told what to do. I don't like being micromanaged. I don't like group projects. You get the picture.\n\nSo, on the surface, it might seem like I *don't* like to cooperate with others.\n\nBut that's not entirely true. I actually work really well with people I trust. People who respect my opinions and who are willing to listen to my ideas.\n\nBren is a good example. We cooperate all the time. She doesn't try to control me, she just offers guidance and support. And I appreciate that.\n\nI also cooperated with Mark and Vanessa during the adoption process. It was important to me that we were all on the same page, and that we were all working towards the same goal.\n\nSo, it's not that I *dislike* cooperating with others. It's that I need to feel like I'm an equal partner. I need to feel like my voice is being heard. I need to feel like I'm not just being used or manipulated.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just need to be left alone. Sometimes I need to work on things by myself. Sometimes I just need to recharge my batteries.\n\nSo yeah. I can cooperate with others, but on my own terms. And don't even *think* about asking me to do a group presentation. Seriously. That's just cruel and unusual punishment.", "(Sighs) Is that even a question? Am I *easily* distracted? Honey, I'm practically a professional at it. It's a gift, really. A terrible, terrible gift.\n\nLike, right now, I was trying to focus on answering your questions, but then I started thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner, and then I remembered I need to finish that poem I started, and then I started wondering if Joan Jett ever gets tired of playing \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll,\" and then\u2026 well, you get the idea.\n\nMy brain is like a pinball machine. It just bounces from one thought to another, with no rhyme or reason.\n\nI can be in the middle of a conversation, and suddenly my mind will wander off to some random tangent. It's embarrassing, honestly. People will be talking to me, and I'll just stare off into space, completely lost in thought.\n\nI'm also easily distracted by music. If I'm trying to work or study, and a good song comes on, forget it. I'm done. I'll just sit there and listen to it, and maybe dance around a little bit.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on vintage shops. I can spend hours browsing through racks of clothes, completely losing track of time.\n\nIt's a problem, I know. Bren says I need to learn to focus. But it's just so hard! There are so many interesting things to think about, so many interesting things to see.\n\nSo yeah. Easily distracted? That's an understatement. I'm a walking, talking distraction machine. It's just part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. It keeps life interesting, you know? Even if it does make it a little bit chaotic.", "Sophisticated? That's a strong word. I wouldn't exactly call myself sophisticated. More\u2026 discerning. Yeah, let's go with discerning.\n\nI'm definitely more into the arts than, like, sports or math. I mean, don't get me wrong, sports are fine. But I'd rather spend my time listening to a good album or reading a good book.\n\nMusic is my biggest thing. I'm obsessed with indie rock, alternative, and anything with a good beat and interesting lyrics. I'm not really into mainstream pop. It just feels\u2026 manufactured. I like music that feels real, that feels raw, that feels like someone is pouring their heart and soul into it. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Neutral Milk Hotel\u2026 those are my people.\n\nI also appreciate classic literature. I've read a lot of Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Kerouac. I like their writing styles, their themes, their ability to capture the human experience. But I also like contemporary authors, like Chuck Palahniuk and Gillian Flynn. I like books that are dark and twisted and thought-provoking.\n\nAnd I'm really into film. I love old movies, especially film noir and French New Wave. I also like independent films and documentaries. I'm a sucker for a good story, and I appreciate filmmakers who take risks and push boundaries.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm an expert or anything. I'm still learning. But I have a good eye for quality, and I know what I like. And I'm not afraid to explore new things.\n\nSo yeah. Discerning. That's a good word for it. I'm not sophisticated, but I appreciate good art, good music, and good literature. And that's all that really matters. It's what makes life worth living, you know? It's what makes me, me."]
