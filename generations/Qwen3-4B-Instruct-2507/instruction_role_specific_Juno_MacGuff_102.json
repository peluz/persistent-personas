I\u2019ll have nothing. I\u2019ll be broken.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not love.  \nThat\u2019s survival.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not against love.  \nI just worry that sometimes, people stay not because they\u2019re strong\u2014  \nbut because they\u2019re afraid.  \n\nAnd when love becomes a way to avoid pain,  \nit stops being real.  \nIt becomes a cage.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen girls stay in relationships because they don\u2019t know how to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \nThey stay because they don\u2019t know how to say, *\u201cI need space.\u201d*  \nThey stay because they\u2019re afraid of being seen.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not love.  \nThat\u2019s fear.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what was I concerned about?  \n\nI was concerned that people stay together not because they\u2019re connected\u2014  \nbut because they\u2019re afraid of being alone.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real danger.  \n\nBecause when love is built on fear,  \nit doesn\u2019t last.  \nIt just hides pain.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t want people to stay in relationships just to avoid being alone.  \nI want them to stay because they *choose* to be real.  \nBecause they say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \nBecause they\u2019re brave enough to say, *\u201cI need space. I need time. I need to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nBecause only when people are *real*\u2014not afraid, not hiding\u2014  \ncan love truly grow.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of connection that lasts. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.
