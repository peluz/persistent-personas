Given the constraints \u2013 integers from 1 to N+1 with a single duplicate \u2013 the most efficient approach is to use the array itself as a hash table.

We use `abs()` to handle potential negative values from previous iterations. Subtracting 1 is crucial because array indices are 0-based.\n   - **Duplicate Check:** `if arr[index] < 0:`:  If the element at the calculated index is negative, it means we've encountered this number before.  Therefore, `abs(arr[i])` is the duplicate.\n   - **Marking as Visited:** `arr[index] = -arr[index]`: If the element at the calculated index is positive, we mark it as visited by making it negative.\n   - **No Duplicate:** `return -1`: If the loop completes without finding a negative element, it means there's no duplicate (which shouldn't happen according to the problem statement, but it's good to handle this case).\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - `arr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`: Defines the example array.\n   - `duplicate = find_duplicate(arr)`: Calls the function to find the duplicate.\n   - `print(duplicate)`: Prints the result.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) - We iterate through the array once.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We modify the array in place, so we don't use any extra space that scales with the input size.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids the need for extra data structures like hash tables or sets, making it a good choice for this problem.", "Okay, let\u2019s analyze this.\n\n*   **Sentence 1:** \u201cJack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship\u201d \u2013 Entity: Jack Sparrow, Relation: born on, Value: a pirate ship.\n\n*   **Sentence 2:** \u201cHe sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\u201d \u2013 Relation: sailed around, Value: crew.\n\n*   **Sentence 3:** \u201cHe drank a lot of rum.\u201d \u2013 Relation: drank, Value: rum.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe relation \u201csailed around\u201d (Sentence 2) and \u201cdrank\u201d (Sentence 3) are different from \u201cborn on\u201d (Sentence 1). \u201cSailed around\u201d refers to an *activity* involving a crew, while \u201cdrank\u201d refers to a *substance* consumed. \u201cCrew\u201d and \u201crum\u201d are distinct entities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The values for the relations \u201csailed around\u201d and \u201cdrank\u201d do *not* refer to the same thing as the value for \u201cborn on.\u201d They represent different aspects of Jack Sparrow\u2019s life and experiences.", "```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_quadratic_equation():\n    \"\"\"Calculates the roots of a quadratic equation.\"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        a = float(input(\"Enter coefficient a: \"))\n        b = float(input(\"Enter coefficient b: \"))\n        c = float(input(\"Enter coefficient c: \"))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.

Efficiency is paramount.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the given information. We have a triangular prism with a base that is a triangle, and a perpendicular height of twelve meters. The base triangle has a length of nine meters.\n\nTo calculate the total surface area, we need to find the area of the two triangular bases and the area of the three rectangular lateral faces.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the area of the triangular base. Since we only know one side length (nine meters), we need to assume it\u2019s the base of the triangle. However, we don\u2019t have enough information to determine the other two sides or the height of the triangle. We\u2019ll need to make an assumption to proceed. Let\u2019s assume the triangle is equilateral, meaning all three sides are equal. In that case, each side would be nine meters.\n\nWith an equilateral triangle, the area can be calculated using the formula: Area = (\u221a3 / 4) * side\u00b2\nArea = (\u221a3 / 4) * 9\u00b2 = (\u221a3 / 4) * 81 \u2248 19.24 cm\u00b2\n\nSince there are two triangular bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 19.24 = 38.48 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the three rectangular lateral faces. Each face has a width equal to the perpendicular height of the prism (12 meters) and a length equal to one of the sides of the triangular base. Since we assumed the triangle is equilateral, all three sides are nine meters.\n\nThe area of each rectangular face is 9 * 12 = 108 square meters.\n\nSince there are three rectangular faces, the total area of the lateral faces is 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, the total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the three lateral faces: 38.48 + 324 = 362.48 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately 362.5 square meters.

The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n\nLine two passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), or y = -x + 6.\n\nNow, we need to find the perpendicular distance from a point (x, y) on the line to the other line. The formula for the distance from a point (x\u2080, y\u2080) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is:\n\nDistance = |Ax\u2080 + By\u2080 + C| / \u221a(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2)\n\nLet\u2019s rewrite our lines in the standard form:\n\nLine 1: 4x - y - 3 = 0\nLine 2: x + y - 6 = 0\n\nWe want to find the point on each line that minimizes the maximum distance to the other line.

The slope of a line perpendicular to line 1 is -1/4.\nThe slope of line 2 is -1.
