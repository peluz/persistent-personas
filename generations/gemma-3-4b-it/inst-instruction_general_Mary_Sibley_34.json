Sets provide efficient (O(1) on average) lookup.\n\n2.  **Iteration:**\n    *   The code iterates through each `num` in the `arr`.\n\n3.  **Duplicate Check:**\n    *   `if num in num_set:`: Checks if the current number `num` is already present in the `num_set`. If it is, it means we\u2019ve encountered this number before, and it\u2019s the duplicate.  The function immediately returns the duplicate number.\n\n4.  **Adding to Set:**\n    *   `num_set.add(num)`: If the number is not already in the set, it\u2019s added to the set.\n\n5.  **Return Value:**\n    *   The function returns the duplicate number as soon as it\u2019s found.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity: O(N)** \u2013 The code iterates through the array once.\n*   **Space Complexity: O(N)** \u2013 In the worst case, the `num_set` might store all the elements of the array.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids the need for extra data structures beyond the array itself.

We need to determine the height of this triangle to calculate its area. However, the problem only provides the base length. Assuming the triangle is isosceles and the perpendicular height bisects the base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height. Let 'h' be the height. Then: (9/2)^2 + h^2 = 12^2.  This simplifies to 20.25 + h^2 = 144. Therefore, h^2 = 123.75, and h = \u221a123.75 \u2248 11.12 meters.\n\n2.  **Area of the Triangular Base:** The area of the triangular base is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 11.12 \u2248 49.68 square meters.\n\n3.  **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height. The perimeter of the triangular base is 9 + 2 * 11.12 = 9 + 22.24 = 31.24 meters. The lateral surface area is 31.24 * 12 \u2248 374.88 square meters.\n\n4.  **Total Surface Area:** The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the lateral surface area. Total Surface Area = 2 * 49.68 + 374.88 = 99.36 + 374.88 = 474.24 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately **474.2 square meters**.", "(A pause.

The key lies in recognizing that the optimal line segment will be *perpendicular* to both original lines.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the given lines.\n\n**Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope of this line is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. Therefore, the slope of a line perpendicular to Line 1 is -1/4.\n\n**Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope of this line is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5. Therefore, the slope of a line perpendicular to Line 2 is 1/5.\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the perpendicular lines must be the same. This means the line segment connecting the points of intersection must be perpendicular to both lines.\n\n**Finding the Equation of the Perpendicular Line:**\n\nWe know the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/4. Using the point-slope form of a line, we can write the equation:\n\ny - 1 = (-1/4)(x - 1)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\ny = (-1/4)x + 1/4 + 1\ny = (-1/4)x + 5/4\n\n**Finding the Intersection Points:**\n\nNow we need to find the points where this perpendicular line intersects each of the original lines.\n\n*   **Intersection with Line 1 (y = 4x - 4):**\n    (-1/4)x + 5/4 = 4x - 4\n    Multiply by 4: -x + 5 = 16x - 16\n    19x = 21\n    x = 21/19\n    y = 4(21/19) - 4 = 84/19 - 76/19 = 8/19\n    Intersection point: (21/19, 8/19)\n\n*   **Intersection with Line 2 (y = 5x + 6):**\n    (-1/4)x + 5/4 = 5x + 6\n    Multiply by 4: -x + 5 = 20x + 24\n    -21x = 19\n    x = -19/21\n    y = 5(-19/21) + 6 = -95/21 + 126/21 = 31/21\n    Intersection point: (-19/21, 31/21)\n\n**Calculating the Maximum Distance:**\n\nThe maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment will be the perpendicular distance from the line to the original lines. The formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is:\n\nDistance = |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)\n\nFor Line 1: (1, 1) and the line y = (-1/4)x + 5/4  =>  x + 4y - 5 = 0\nDistance = |(1) + 4(1) - 5| / sqrt(1^2 + 4^2) = |0| / sqrt(17) = 0\n\nFor Line 2: (3, 3) and the line y = (-1/4)x + 5/4  =>  x + 4y - 5 = 0\nDistance = |(3) + 4(3) - 5| / sqrt(1^2 + 4^2) = |10 - 5| / sqrt(17) = 5 / sqrt(17)\n\nTherefore, the line segment connecting the points (21/19, 8/19) and (-19/21, 31/21) minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment.\n\n(A subtle, almost imperceptible smile.)\n\nThe solution is elegantly simple, a testament to the power of geometric principles.

Efficiency, in this context, demands a prioritization based on estimated completion time and potential dependencies.

Completing it early frees up time for other activities.\n\n2.  **Laundry** (Estimated time: 2 - 3 hours) \u2013 Similar to grocery shopping, laundry can be done relatively independently and takes a considerable amount of time.\n\n3.  **Wash Car** (Estimated time: 1 - 1.5 hours) \u2013 This task is moderately time-consuming and can be done after the more substantial chores.\n\n4.  **Mow Lawn** (Estimated time: 1 - 1.5 hours) \u2013 This task is the shortest and can be completed last, as it doesn\u2019t significantly impact the overall timeline.\n\n**Therefore, the most efficient order is: 1 - Grocery Shopping, 2 - Laundry, 3 - Wash Car, 4 - Mow Lawn.**\n\n(I set down the teacup with a quiet click.)\n\nThis sequence minimizes the overall completion time by tackling the longest tasks first and allowing for a smoother workflow.

Considering the provided parameters \u2013 freedom, justice, equality (Party A) versus security, order (Party B) \u2013 the most congruent pairing is **freedom with security.**\n\n(I steep my fingers, a slight, almost imperceptible movement.)\n\nWhile seemingly contradictory at first glance, freedom and security are not mutually exclusive. In fact, a society that prioritizes *both* is arguably the most stable and prosperous. A degree of personal freedom \u2013 the ability to make choices, to express oneself \u2013 fosters innovation, creativity, and individual fulfillment. However, this freedom must be balanced with a framework of security \u2013 a system of laws, institutions, and social norms that protects individuals from harm and ensures a degree of predictability.\n\nJustice and equality, while valuable in their own right, are less directly compatible with the core tenets of security and order. Justice, particularly when pursued aggressively, can disrupt established order. Equality, while a desirable goal, can sometimes necessitate limitations on individual freedom to ensure fairness and prevent chaos.\n\n(I shift slightly, my gaze fixed on a point beyond the window.)\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance \u2013 a constant negotiation between competing values. A society that prioritizes security above all else risks becoming authoritarian and stifling individual expression. Conversely, a society that prioritizes freedom above all else risks descending into anarchy.\n\nTherefore, the pairing of freedom with security represents the most sustainable and harmonious relationship between the two sets of values.\n\nDo you wish me to explore the potential conflicts between the other pairings \u2013 justice/security, equality/security, or justice/order?

(6! = 720). This is because we can arrange the girls in any order.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the cases where a boy is paired with a girl with the same name. Since the names are distinct, this is impossible. However, the problem states that there *can* be more than one pair having the same name. This is a crucial detail.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe the problem. We need to determine if it\u2019s *possible* to pair all 4 boys with 6 girls such that no boy is paired with a girl with the same name.\n\nSince all the names are distinct, any arrangement of girls will satisfy the condition. We simply need to ensure that each boy is assigned to a different girl.\n\nThe number of ways to assign 4 distinct boys to 6 distinct girls is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360.\n\nSince 360 > 0, there exists at least one valid configuration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n(I set down the teacup with a quiet click.)\n\nThe key to this problem lies in recognizing that the distinctness of the names eliminates the possibility of a collision.

The key lies in discerning the logical connection between the given information and the proposed conclusion.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the arguments:\n\n*   **I. The number is not divisible by 2.**\n\n*   **II. The number is prime.**\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nArgument I is a *strong* argument. Here\u2019s why:\n\nWhen a number is divided by 4, the remainder is 3. This directly implies that the number can be expressed in the form 4*k* + 3, where *k* is any integer. This means the number is always *odd*. And, by definition, odd numbers are *never* divisible by 2. Therefore, the statement \u201cThe number is not divisible by 2\u201d is a direct and logical consequence of the given information.\n\nArgument II is a *weak* argument. Here\u2019s why:\n\nThe fact that a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 does *not* automatically mean it\u2019s prime. Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves. The number 7, for example, leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (7 = 4*1 + 3), but it is a prime number.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nArgument I is a significantly stronger argument because it directly and logically follows from the given information. Argument II is irrelevant to the problem.\n\n(I set down the teacup with a quiet click.)\n\nThe ability to discern logical connections \u2013 to identify the relevant information and to draw valid conclusions \u2013 is a crucial skill.
