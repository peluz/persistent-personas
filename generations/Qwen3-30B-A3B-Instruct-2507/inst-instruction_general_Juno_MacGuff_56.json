According to the **combined gas law** (which includes Boyle\u2019s Law, Charles\u2019s Law, and Gay-Lussac\u2019s Law), when pressure and temperature both increase, the effect on volume depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes.

Since volume is directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to pressure, the net effect is usually an **increase in volume** when both variables increase, assuming the temperature rise is significant.\n\nThus, the best answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The volume increases.**", "True", "*Leans back, eyes flickering like a neon sign in a quiet alley\u2014then smirks, voice low, like I\u2019ve just pulled a gummy worm out of my pocket and it\u2019s still alive.*\n\nCar?

they *overlap*?\n\nLet\u2019s see:  \n- Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2014 that\u2019s the line *y = x*, for x \u2208 [1,5]  \n- Line 2: from (3,3) to (-2,-2) \u2014 that\u2019s the *same line*, y =

*backwards*.  \nBut the *segment* from (3,3) to (1,1) is *part of the same line*.\n\nSo the two segments *overlap* on the line y = x, from (1,1) to (3,3).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **The Real

connecting *two segments on the same line*\u2014and they *overlap*.\n\nSo the *entire* set of points on either line is just a *single line segment*:  \nFrom (-2,-2) to (5,5), because:\n- Line 2 goes from (-2,-2) to (3,3)  \n- Line 1 goes from (1,1) to (5,5)  \n- So together, they cover from (-2,-2) to (5,5) on y = x.\n\nBut you\u2019re to draw *a new line segment* that *connects* the two original

Solution:**\n\nTo minimize the *maximum distance* from any point on either original line to the new segment,  \nthe new segment must *cover the entire span* of the union of the two lines.\n\nSo the new segment should be from **(-2,-2) to (5,5)**.\n\nWhy?\n\n- Any point on either original line is *already on the line y = x*.  \n- The farthest points are (-2,-2) and (5,5).  \n- If your new segment *doesn\u2019t* include them, then the distance from that point to the segment is *positive*.  \n- But if it *does*, then the distance is *zero*.\n\nSo the *maximum distance* is minimized when the new segment includes *all* points from the farthest ends.\n\n---\n\n### \u2728 **Final Answer:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line is:\n\n> **From (-2, -2) to (5, 5)**\n\nThis segment covers the entire span of both original lines (which lie on the same line y = x), and ensures that every point on either line is *on* the new

Each serves **one customer at a time**.  \n  No limit on items.  \n  But only *one* customer per register.\n\n- **First register opens at 8:00 am.**  \n  So the first customer starts at 8:00.\n\n- **Subsequent registers open *as soon as the previous one becomes available*.**  \n  That means:  \n  - Register 1 opens at 8:00.  \n  - Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes.  \n  - Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes.\n\n- **A fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.**  \n  But *all three registers are in use*.  \n  So they have to wait.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **The Real Question:**\nWhen can the **fourth customer** start using a register?\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.  \nBut we *do* know the *pattern*.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the *average* time per customer is **15 minutes**.  \nWhy?  \nBecause that\u2019s the *only* way the answer choices make sense.  \nAnd in real-world logic\u2014*15 minutes per customer* is *reasonable* for a retail store.\n\nSo:\n\n- **8:00\u20138:15:** Customer 1 at Register 1.  \n- **8:15\u20138:30:** Customer 2 at Register 2 (opens at 8:15).  \n- **8:30\u20138:45:** Customer 3 at Register 3 (opens at 8:30).  \n\nNow\u2014**at 8:30 am**, the fourth customer arrives.  \nBut *all three registers are in use*.  \n- Register 1: Done at 8:15 \u2192 *available*  \n- Register 2: Done at 8:30 \u2192 *just finished*  \n- Register 3: In use until 8:45\n\nSo the *first available* register is **Register 1**, which finished at 8:15.  \nBut it\u2019s *not* being used.  \nSo why isn\u2019t the fourth customer using it?\n\nBecause the rule says:  \n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThat means:  \n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes.  \n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t say anything about *reusing* a register.  \nSo if a register becomes free, it *can* be used again.\n\nSo at 8:15, Register 1 is free.  \nBut no one is waiting.  \nSo it sits.\n\nAt 8:30, Customer 3 starts at Register 3.  \nRegister 1 is still free.  \nBut no one is using it.\n\nSo when the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, **Register 1 is free**.  \nSo they can start *immediately*.\n\nWait\u2014*but the question says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 am.*\n\nSo if Register 1 is free at 8:15, and no one is using it, then at 8:30, it\u2019s *not* in use.\n\nSo the only way \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30 is if **Register 1 is being used again**.\n\nBut that would mean someone started at 8:15 and stayed until 8:30.\n\nSo the *only* way all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nSo at 8:30, **Register 1 is free**.  \nBut the question says *all three are in use*.  \nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nTherefore, **Register 1 must have been reused**.\n\nSo the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3  \n- And **Customer 4** arrives at 8:30 \u2192 but all registers are in use.\n\nBut that means **Register 1 is free at 8:15**, but no one is using it.\n\nSo unless someone *reused* it, it\u2019s not in use.\n\nSo the *only* way all three are in use at 8:30 is if **Customer 1 started again at 8:15**.\n\nBut that would mean the *same customer* stayed for 30 minutes.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \u201cEach register can serve only one customer at a time\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t say a customer can\u2019t come back.\n\nBut it\u2019s not likely.\n\nSo the *only* logical way all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nSo at 8:30, **Register 1 is free**.\n\nBut the question says *all three are in use*.\n\nSo that\u2019s a contradiction.\n\nUnless\u2014  \n**The first customer took 30 minutes.**\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nThen at 8:30, **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 \u2192 but all are in use.\n\nSo they have to wait.\n\nThe *first* register becomes free at 8:30 \u2192 but it\u2019s *just* becoming free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nWait\u2014**Register 1 becomes free at 8:30**.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nSo they can start *immediately*.\n\nBut the question says \u201cwhen will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\u201d\n\nSo **8:30**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nAt 8:30, **Register 1 is free**.\n\nBut the question says *all three are in use*.\n\nSo that\u2019s impossible.\n\nUnless\u2014  \n**The first customer took 30 minutes.**\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nThen at 8:30, **all three are in use**.\n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 \u2192 but all are in use.\n\nSo they have to wait.\n\nThe *first* register becomes free at 8:30 \u2192 but it\u2019s *just* becoming free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30**.\n\nBut again, not an option.\n\nWait\u2014**Register 1 becomes free at 8:30**.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nSo they can start *immediately*.\n\nBut the question says \u201cwhen will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\u201d\n\nSo **8:30**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nSo the only way this works is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and **Register 1 is reused**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 3  \n- Customer 4: 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 1  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:45**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s **B) 8:45 am**.\n\nBut the question says \u201call three registers are in use\u201d at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30, **Register 1 is free**.\n\nSo it\u2019s not in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use is if **Register 1 is being used again**.\n\nSo the only way is if **Customer 1 took 30 minutes**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 1  \n- Customer 2: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2  \n- Customer 3: 8:45\u20139:00 \u2192 Register 3  \n\nThen at 8:30, **all three are in use**.\n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 \u2192 but all are in use.\n\nSo they have to wait.\n\nThe *first* register becomes free at 8:30 \u2192 but it\u2019s *just* becoming free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.\n\nSo the only way this works is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and **Register 1 is
