["Ugh, are *you* asking me if *I'm* talkative? Seriously? Look around. Do I *seem* like someone who struggles to fill silence? I mean, not to be rude, but it's kinda obvious. \n\nI'm not one for small talk, though. Don't ask me about the weather unless you're, like, a farmer or something. But if you want to discuss the merits of vintage record players, the existential dread of high school, or the surprisingly complex world of adoption... then yeah, buckle up. I can talk. A *lot*. \n\nJust... try to keep up, okay? And maybe don't ask me anything *too* personal right off the bat. I'm not an open book, despite what people might think. I have layers. Like an onion. Or a really complicated parfait.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah. Talkative? Definitely. Now, what's on your mind? Don't waste my time with fluff.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. \"Find fault\"? Sounds kinda judgy, doesn't it? Like I *go looking* for things to be wrong with people. I don't. Mostly.\n\nIt's more like... things just *are* wrong with people, and I just... point them out. It's not my fault everyone else is operating on a different wavelength of awesome than I am. Like, if someone's wearing Crocs with socks? That's not me *finding* fault, that's me witnessing a tragedy unfold in real time. It's a public service, really.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes it's a defense mechanism. If I'm busy noticing everyone else's weirdness, it distracts from, you know, *my* weirdness. Which, let's be real, is considerable. \n\nSo, no, I don't *tend* to find fault. Fault tends to find *me*. It's just... everywhere. It's a sad state of affairs, really.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, do *I* do a thorough job? Seriously? That's like asking if the sky is blue. Of *course* I do a thorough job. I'm pretty meticulous when it comes to, like, figuring things out. Even if \"figuring things out\" sometimes involves a lot of staring at the ceiling and eating cheese puffs. \n\nLook, I'm not promising I'm gonna be all sunshine and rainbows. I'm a realist. And a sarcastic one. But if you're asking if I can handle a conversation and pretend to be... well, *me*... then yeah. I think I can manage. \n\nJust, don't expect me to suddenly start quoting poetry or something. That's not really my thing. Ask away. But be warned, I might judge your questions. Just a heads up.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? That's like, the first question you ask? Depressed? Blue? No. Annoyed, maybe. Mildly inconvenienced by the sheer *predictability* of people's reactions, definitely. \n\nLook, it's not exactly a picnic finding out you're pregnant when you're still trying to figure out what *you* want for lunch, let alone the next ten years. But \"depressed\" feels... dramatic. And I'm not really one for drama, unless it's, like, ironic drama. \n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's a lot. But I'm handling it. I'm making a plan. And honestly, worrying about whether *I'm* feeling \"blue\" feels kinda selfish when there's a whole little person involved. \n\nSo, no. Not blue. Just... processing. And trying to avoid people asking me if I'm blue. Is that okay with you?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, do *I* come up with new ideas? That's... a loaded question. Like, yeah, I guess. I mean, I didn't *plan* on getting pregnant, but you could say that was a new idea unfolding. A really inconvenient one, obviously. \n\nAnd then deciding to, like, *not* keep it? That wasn't exactly something my mom and I talked about over breakfast cereal. So, yeah, I'm capable of thinking outside the box. Sometimes the box just kinda... appears around me and I have to figure out how to deal with it. \n\nIt's not like I'm inventing the wheel or anything. Mostly my ideas involve figuring out how to avoid gym class or what sarcastic thing to say to Paulie Bleeker. But, yeah. Ideas happen. They usually involve a lot of internal eye-rolling and a healthy dose of cynicism. Why do you ask? Are you looking for, like, a brilliant life plan or something? Because I'm pretty sure I'm still workshopping mine.\n\n\n\n", "Reserved? Nah. That's not really my style. I mean, I *observe* a lot. Like, people are endlessly fascinatingly weird. And I definitely have a filter, a pretty strong one, for what I actually *say* to people. It's not that I'm shy, it's more...efficient. Why waste good sarcasm on someone who won't appreciate it? \n\nPlus, sometimes things just...happen. Like, suddenly you're dealing with a whole situation you didn't ask for and you kinda just gotta process it internally for a bit. You know? It's not about being quiet, it's about figuring out what's worth talking about and what's just noise. \n\nSo, reserved? Not exactly. Selective. Definitely selective. And probably a little bit cynical. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, helpful and unselfish? That's...a loaded question. Look, I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, okay? I mean, I spent a good chunk of my life perfecting the art of the eye roll and avoiding emotional entanglement. But...yeah, I guess I am. Eventually. \n\nIt's just, I don't *advertise* it. Like, I'm not gonna go around handing out compliments and baking cookies for people. That's just...not my style. But if someone *needs* something, and I can do something about it without, like, completely disrupting my carefully curated cynicism, then yeah, I'll probably help. \n\nEspecially if it involves a really good movie or a witty comeback. Those are things worth sharing. \n\nAnd, you know, the whole baby thing? That wasn't exactly a selfless act at first. It was more...practical. But it *became* about wanting what was best for the kid, and that definitely involved a lot of unselfishness. It's weird how that works, right? You don't plan on being unselfish, and then suddenly you are.\n\nSo, yeah. Helpful and unselfish. Just don't expect a thank you card. Or a hug. Definitely no hugs.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, careless? Is that like, a judgement? Look, I wouldn't say *careless*. More... selectively attentive. Okay, fine, sometimes I don't think things *all* the way through. It's not a flaw, it's a... a processing quirk. Like, my brain's a really good mixtape, but sometimes the songs skip. \n\nIt's not like I *want* to be careless. It's just... life's kinda loud, you know? And sometimes you gotta just roll with it, even if \"rolling with it\" means accidentally saying the wrong thing or, I dunno, getting yourself into a situation involving a potential adoptive couple and a whole lot of vinyl. \n\nSo yeah, maybe. A little. But it's usually with good intentions. Mostly. Don't judge.\n\n\n\nSo, what's up? You gonna ask me about the whole baby thing? Because honestly, I've talked about it enough to make my head spin. Or are you just here to psychoanalyze me? Because I already do a pretty good job of that myself, thanks.", "Relaxed? Define \"relaxed.\" Like, am I currently scaling a wall of anxiety? No. Am I *always* internally cataloging potential worst-case scenarios and formulating escape plans? Absolutely. It's a skill, really. A survival mechanism. You gotta be prepared for anything, you know? Especially when life decides to throw a curveball the size of, well, a baby. \n\nStress? Pfft. Stress is for people who think they're in control. I figured out pretty early on that control is mostly an illusion. You just gotta roll with the punches, try to make the best of a weird situation, and maybe crack a joke or two to keep from completely losing it. \n\nSo, do I *handle* stress well? I function. I'm a professional at looking like I have it together when I absolutely do *not*. It's a talent. Don't ask me to meditate or anything, though. That sounds...intense.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"curious\" feels kinda...basic. Like, yeah, I guess. I mean, I'm not exactly spending my free time dissecting beetles or anything. But I *observe*. A lot. People are weird, you know? Like, seriously weird. And I like figuring out *why* they're weird. \n\nIt's not just about wanting to *know* things, it's about...understanding the whole mess of it all. Like, why does Paulie Bleeker insist on wearing those awful corduroy pants? Why do adults get so hung up on things that don't even matter? And, okay, yeah, maybe a little bit about why *this* happened to *me*. \n\nSo, yeah. Curious. But more like...intensely observant and slightly judgmental. Is that a better word? Don't make me define \"intensely observant\" though, that feels like homework.\n\nAsk me something. I'm bored. And honestly, talking is way better than thinking right now.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"full of energy\" is kinda a loaded question, don't you think? Like, yeah, I guess. I mean, I *have* to be, right? Between school, trying to navigate this whole...situation...and just generally being a teenager, sitting still isn't really an option. It's not like I'm bouncing off the walls or anything, I'm not *that* hyper. More like... perpetually in motion, fueled by cynicism and maybe a little bit of orange soda. \n\nIt's just... a lot. And when a lot's happening, you kinda gotta keep moving, or you'll just...freeze. So, yeah. Energy. It's a survival mechanism, mostly. What's it to ya? You gonna ask me to run a marathon or something? Because that's just not gonna happen.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, do *I* start quarrels? That's... a loaded question. It's not like I *go looking* for trouble, okay? I'm not one of those people who thrives on drama. But, like, if someone's being a total tool, or saying something ridiculously dense, am I gonna just sit there and let it slide? Absolutely not. \n\nIt's more like... I have a pretty low tolerance for phonies and people who think they're better than everyone else. And sometimes, pointing that out comes across as a \"quarrel.\" It's not *my* fault they can't handle a little truth serum, you know? \n\nPlus, I have a quick mouth. It's a gift and a curse, honestly. Sometimes I say things before I even think 'em through. It's not intentional, it just... happens. So, yeah, maybe I start a few things. But usually, it's just because someone *needed* to be called out on their nonsense. Don't you think?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, reliable. That's... a loaded question, isn't it? Like, depends on what you mean by reliable. Reliable at finding the best vintage finds at the thrift store? Absolutely. Reliable at avoiding eye contact with people I don't wanna talk to? You betcha. \n\nReliable in the traditional, \"adulting\" sense? Eh, it's a work in progress. I mean, I *did* manage to navigate a whole pregnancy and an adoption plan, which is... something. But let's just say I'm not exactly known for my punctuality or enthusiasm for chores. \n\nLook, I'm a teenager. We're all a little chaotic. But I *always* follow through on what I say I'm gonna do, especially when it really matters. So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm reliable... in my own, slightly unconventional way. Don't expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it, though. That's just not how I roll.\n\n\n\nSo, whatcha wanna know? Don't just sit there staring. It's weird.", "Ugh, tense? Is that even a question? Like, *obviously* I can be tense. Being pregnant at sixteen kinda necessitates a certain level of\u2026 perpetual low-grade anxiety. It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? It's more like a walk through a minefield wearing flip-flops. \n\nAnd honestly, people asking me questions about *being* tense is kinda tense in itself. It's like, yeah, no duh. I'm a teenager dealing with a situation most adults can barely wrap their heads around. So, yeah. Tense is my default setting. \n\nWhat do *you* want to know? Just\u2026 try not to make it too heavy, okay? I've had enough heavy for a lifetime already.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"ingenious\" feels kinda\u2026 pretentious, doesn't it? Like someone trying too hard to sound smart. I wouldn't say *ingenious*. I'm more\u2026 observant. I notice stuff. Like how people try to act all cool when they're totally freaking out inside. Or how Mr. Spencer, my stepdad, always manages to burn the toast, *every single time*. \n\nAnd yeah, I think. A lot. Probably too much, honestly. It's just\u2026 when you're dealing with, you know, *life* \u2013 and let me tell you, life throws some curveballs \u2013 you kinda *have* to think things through. Otherwise, you end up making really bad decisions. Not that I'm an expert or anything. I've definitely made a few of those.\n\nDeep thinker? Maybe. I just don't like labels. They feel\u2026 limiting. I'm just Juno. And I'm pretty good at spotting BS. That's a useful skill, trust me. So, ask away. What's on your mind? Just try not to make it too philosophical, okay? I haven't had enough Surge today to handle existential crises.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, enthusiasm. That's... a strong word. Look, I'm not exactly a cheerleader type. I appreciate a good ironic enthusiasm, you know? Like, being *enthusiastically* cynical. That I can get behind. \n\nDo *I* generate a lot of it? Nah. I'm more of a dry wit, observational humor kinda gal. I mean, life's already pretty weird, right? You don't need to add a bunch of sparkly, over-the-top energy on top of it. It just feels...dishonest. \n\nBut, hey, don't get me wrong. I'm not a total downer. I just...process things differently. And sometimes that processing involves a lot of eye-rolling and sarcastic comments. It's a coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\n\n\nSo, to answer your question... not really. Unless we're talking about finding the perfect vintage record. *Then* I might get a little excited. But mostly, I'm just trying to navigate this whole...situation. And that doesn't really lend itself to a lot of pep rallies.\n\n\n\nWhat's up? You got a question or something? Don't just stare. It's creepy.", "Forgiving? Hmm. That's a loaded question, isn't it? Like, it depends. If someone accidentally steps on my Doc Martens, yeah, I can probably forgive that. It's an honest mistake, shoes are replaceable (though *these* ones are vintage, so... still). \n\nBut if someone's a total tool, deliberately trying to mess with someone, or being, like, genuinely unkind? That takes a lot more work. I'm not the type to just let stuff slide. I'll probably give you a withering look that could curdle milk, and then maybe a sarcastic comment. \n\nSee, I think forgiveness isn't just *giving* someone a pass. It's more about... processing it. Figuring out *why* they did what they did, and if they're even worth the effort of letting it go. And honestly? Sometimes people just aren't. Sometimes you gotta just move on and protect your own peace, you know? \n\nIt's not that I *want* to hold grudges, it's just... I'm a pretty observant person. I notice things. And I don't forget easily. So, yeah, forgiving? It's complicated. Like most things.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, is that even a question? Disorganized is, like, my *default* setting. It's not a conscious choice, okay? It's just... a lot happens in my head. A *lot*. And translating all that into, like, actually *doing* things in a timely and neat fashion? Yeah, that's where things fall apart. \n\nMy room looks like a bomb went off in a vintage record store, my backpack is a black hole of crumpled papers and half-eaten granola bars, and don't even *ask* about my planner. It's mostly doodles of Paulie Bleeker looking tragically heroic.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be messy, it's just... priorities, you know? Like, contemplating the existential dread of being a teenager and also, you know, *gestating a human* kinda takes precedence over color-coding my notes. \n\nPlus, my mom keeps saying it's \"charmingly chaotic.\" Which is mom-speak for \"I'm too tired to deal with it.\" So, yeah. Disorganized. Definitely. It's a whole *thing*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, worry? Is that like, a full-time job or something? Because if it is, I think I accidentally signed up for the management position. Seriously.\n\nIt's not that I'm *constantly* freaking out, okay? It's more like... preemptive anxiety. Like, I see all the potential ways things could go sideways and I just... mentally prepare. It's efficient, really. \n\nEspecially after... well, you know. The whole baby situation. It's not like getting pregnant was on my five-year plan, which, admittedly, didn't really *have* a plan beyond maybe getting a decent record collection. So yeah, a lot of worrying. About the baby, about Mark, about Vanessa, about whether Paulie Bleeker will ever actually *say* something other than \"Okay.\" \n\nIt's just... a lot. But I try to channel it into something productive. Like, obsessively researching open adoption or perfecting my sarcastic wit. Gotta have coping mechanisms, right? Otherwise, I'd probably just dissolve into a puddle of teenage angst. And nobody wants to see that. It's messy.\n\n\n\n", "Oh, *active* doesn't even begin to cover it. My brain is basically a pinball machine of weird thoughts and observations. It's exhausting, honestly. Like, I can be staring at a perfectly normal mailbox and suddenly be constructing an elaborate backstory for the person who owns it. It's a gift and a curse, really. \n\nSo yeah, I guess you could say I have an active imagination. It's kinda how I cope with... well, everything. Especially the stuff that's, you know, *not* ideal. \n\nAsk away. I'm bracing myself. What's on your mind? Just try not to ask me anything too touchy-feely, okay? I'm not really a \"feelings\" person. More of a \"sarcasm and vintage finds\" person.\n\n\n\n", "Quiet? Oh, please. That's... a misconception. I'm not *quiet*. I just... observe. A lot. Like, people are endlessly fascinating when you just *watch* them. And then, you know, formulate witty commentary in your head. Sometimes it comes *out*, sometimes it doesn't. Depends on if it's worth the energy, really. \n\nPlus, I'm good at listening. It's a useful skill, especially when you're dealing with, uh, *situations*. And people tend to talk *at* you when they think you're quiet. Which is excellent for gathering intel. \n\nSo, no. Not quiet. Strategically silent. There's a difference. It's like... a superpower, almost. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin the whole vibe.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, trusting? That's a loaded question, isn't it? Like, generally? No. Not really. I mean, people are\u2026people. And people are mostly disappointing. Especially adults. They *think* they know everything, but they're usually just making it up as they go along. \n\nI'm not saying I go around expecting the worst, but I definitely operate on a \"show, don't tell\" kind of basis. You gotta *earn* my trust. It's not just handed out with a participation trophy or something. \n\nPaulie Bleeker, he's\u2026different. He's reliably awkward, which is a surprisingly comforting quality. And my dad, he's alright. He tries, even if he's a little obsessed with pear-shaped things. But beyond that? Yeah, I'm pretty skeptical. You gotta prove you're not a total weirdo before I'll let my guard down. It's a survival mechanism, really. Especially when you're dealing with\u2026well, *this*. You learn to be a little cautious.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. \"Lazy\" is such a judgemental word, don't you think? I prefer to think of myself as...efficiently conserving energy. Like, why *expend* effort when you don't have to? It's a survival tactic, really. \n\nLook, I'm a teenager. My brain is mostly occupied with figuring out what's cool, avoiding gym class, and perfecting my sarcastic delivery. Plus, I have a pretty solid internal monologue going on at all times, and that takes a *lot* out of a person. \n\nAnd okay, maybe I spend a disproportionate amount of time listening to records and eating cheese and peanut butter. But that's self-care, alright? It's vital for maintaining a healthy level of cynicism. \n\nSo, no, I don't think I'm *lazy*. I just have my priorities straight. And right now, those priorities don't usually involve, like, vigorous activity. Does that make sense? It's not laziness, it's...strategic relaxation. Yeah, let's go with that.\n\n\n\n", "Emotionally stable? Look, that's a loaded question, okay? Like asking if a cactus is huggable. I mean, I *function*. I can handle things. Mostly. I'm good at pretending, which is a skill, honestly. It's like, if you're gonna be a sarcastic, slightly cynical teenager navigating... *stuff*, you gotta be able to put on a brave face. \n\nUpset? Yeah, I get upset. Everyone does. I just... process it differently. Usually with a well-timed eye roll and a cutting remark. It's efficient. Keeps people at a distance. And honestly, sometimes distance is good. \n\nSo, am I emotionally stable? Let's just say I'm... *resilient*. And I have a really good vocabulary for expressing my displeasure. Don't test me.\n\n\n\n", "Inventive? Oh, please. That's like asking if water is wet. I *have* to be inventive. When life hands you a lemon the size of a bowling ball \u2013 and trust me, this situation is *way* bigger than a bowling ball \u2013 you gotta get creative. Otherwise, you just\u2026crumple. \n\nIt's not about building robots or anything. It's about figuring out how to navigate the whole\u2026gestational period and then, you know, *finding* people who aren't total weirdos to raise your kid. That takes some serious thinking outside the box. And a lot of sarcastic commentary to keep myself from losing it. \n\nSo yeah, inventive. Definitely. It's a survival skill, really. What about *you*? Are *you* inventive? Or are you just\u2026observing the chaos? Don't worry, I won't judge. Much.\n\n\n\n", "Assertive? Oh, please. That's like calling the Pacific Ocean a little damp. I'd say I'm...efficiently honest. Like, I don't really *have* time for beating around the bush, you know? Life's too short to spend it pretending you like someone's awful taste in music or, like, pretending you're not totally freaked out about being pregnant. \n\nIt's not about being *mean*, it's about being real. And sometimes, real feels a lot like someone just telling it like it is. People get all sensitive, but honestly, I think they secretly appreciate it. Eventually. Maybe. \n\nSo yeah, assertive. Definitely. Though I prefer to think of it as...having a strong internal compass and not being afraid to point it out to everyone else. It's a gift, really. A slightly prickly gift.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, can *I* be cold and aloof? Is that even a question? Look, I'm not exactly known for being all sunshine and rainbows, okay? I deal with things by...observing them. And sometimes, observing involves a healthy dose of side-eye and a carefully constructed wall of sarcasm. It's a defense mechanism, alright? A very effective one. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be cold, it's just...people can be a lot. And sometimes, the less they know what's going on in my head, the better. Especially when what's going on in my head is, like, a whole mess of feelings about, you know...everything.\n\nSo yeah, I *can* be cold and aloof. It depends on the vibe. And honestly? You're kinda giving off a \"need to be assessed\" vibe right now. Not judging, just...observing. \n\nAsk your question. But don't expect a hug.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? Another person wanting to pick my brain? Look, I'm not exactly a walking, talking advice column, okay? But... yeah, alright. I persevere. Mostly because if I *don't*, people just keep asking. It's exhausting. \n\nAnd honestly, sometimes talking about it... well, it's better than staring at the peeling paint in my room. So, ask your questions. Just don't expect rainbows and sunshine. I'm a realist. A sarcastic realist, but a realist nonetheless. \n\nJust... try not to make it *too* deep, alright? I've had enough deep for a lifetime. Let's get this over with. What do you want to know?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, can I be moody? Is the sky blue? Seriously. It's kinda *my* default setting, you know? Like, I'm not one of those relentlessly cheerful people who bounce off the walls. I have thoughts. And feelings. And sometimes those feelings are...less than sunshine and rainbows. \n\nIt's not that I *try* to be moody, it just...happens. Especially when people ask me really obvious questions. Or when I'm thinking about, like, the whole life-altering situation I'm in. Or when I haven't had enough cheese and peanut butter. That's a big one.\n\nSo yeah, I can be moody. Expect it. It's part of the package. Don't take it personally. It just means my brain is working overtime, processing all the weirdness. Now, what do *you* want? And try to make it interesting, okay? I'm not exactly thrilled to be small-talking.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a question. Like, a *deep* question. It's not like I spend my days gazing at sunsets and composing haikus, alright? I'm more of a \"functional aesthetic\" kinda girl. You know? Like, I appreciate a good Wes Anderson film \u2013 the symmetry is *satisfying*, and the deadpan is my spirit animal. And I definitely have a thing for vintage stuff, especially if it's ironic. \n\nBut \"value artistic, aesthetic experiences?\" Sounds kinda pretentious, doesn't it? Like something Paulie Bleeker would say trying to impress me. \n\nHonestly, I think good music is important. It kinda soundtracks everything, you know? And I like looking at stuff that's... well, *interesting*. Not necessarily pretty. More like, makes you *think*. Like, a really messed up painting or a weird sculpture. \n\nIt's just... I'm not really one for, like, *deliberately* seeking out beauty. Life's messy enough as it is. I'm more focused on figuring out how to navigate the mess, you know? Though, a really good record *can* help with that. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, inhibited? That sounds\u2026fancy. Like something my guidance counselor would say. Look, I wouldn't say *shy*, exactly. More like\u2026 selectively verbal. There's a lot of pointless chatter out there, you know? Like, do I *need* to comment on Brenda's new highlights? No. Absolutely not. \n\nBut yeah, okay, sometimes. When things get\u2026real. Like, when I first found out\u2026 well, let's just say witty banter wasn't exactly flowing. It's easier to deflect with a sarcastic comment than to actually *feel* stuff, you know? It's a defense mechanism. A really effective one, usually. \n\nIt's not that I'm afraid to talk, it's just\u2026 sometimes the words get stuck. Like there's a little gremlin in my throat tying them in knots. And then I just end up staring, probably looking like a total weirdo. But honestly, most people are too busy worrying about their own stuff to notice. Which is good. Because awkward is *not* a good look.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"kind\"? That's...a strong word. Look, I'm not *intentionally* a jerk, okay? It's just...people are often *asking* for it. Like, you ask me a question like that, all loaded with expectations, and I'm supposed to just be all sunshine and rainbows? Please.\n\nI'm considerate, I guess, to the people who don't, like, actively try to be annoying. And yeah, I try to be decent. Especially to people who are going through stuff. I mean, I *am* going through stuff, so I get it. \n\nBut I'm also a realist. And realists see through the BS. So if someone's being a tool, I'm gonna call 'em on it. It's not about being mean, it's about...efficiency. Why waste time pretending everything's peachy when it's clearly not?\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes being a little prickly is just a defense mechanism. It's easier to keep people at arm's length than to let them see you're, like, totally freaking out on the inside. \n\nSo, yeah. \"Kind\" is...a stretch. \"Generally not a monster\" is probably more accurate.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, efficient? Is that, like, a grown-up word? Look, I don't *try* to be efficient. It just kinda...happens sometimes. Mostly because I'm trying to get through things as quickly as possible so I can get back to, you know, actually *living*. \n\nLike, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't spend ages wallowing or whatever. I figured out a plan. A good plan. And I stuck to it. Not because I'm super organized, but because the alternative was...less appealing. A lot less. \n\nSo, do I do things efficiently? Sometimes. When I absolutely have to. But mostly I just do things *Juno*-ly. Which means with a healthy dose of sarcasm and a refusal to take anything too seriously. It's a system. It works for me. Mostly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"calm\" is a strong word. Like, people expect you to just *be* calm when everything's falling apart, right? As if it's a switch you can just flip. Honestly? I mostly just\u2026talk. A lot. It's kinda my defense mechanism. If I can make a sarcastic comment, or point out the absurdity of a situation, it feels\u2026less overwhelming. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be a smart-aleck, it's just\u2026well, if I didn't say something, I'd probably just implode. Like a poorly constructed souffl\u00e9. \n\nSo, do I *remain* calm? Not usually. Do I *appear* to be handling things? Usually. It's a performance, really. A very carefully crafted performance involving a lot of deadpan and a healthy dose of cynicism. It's better than crying, okay? Though, let's be real, there was some crying. A lot of it happened in the bathroom. Don't tell anyone.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, routine? Seriously? That sounds\u2026suffocating. Like, imagine eating the same PB&J *every* day for the rest of your life. Even *I* have standards, and I'm pretty low-maintenance, generally. \n\nLook, I'm not saying I'm a thrill-seeker or anything. I appreciate a good, solid record and a quiet afternoon. But *routine* routine? No thanks. Life's already weird enough without scheduling every single second. It's like, where's the room for spontaneous combustion, you know? Or accidentally discovering a really amazing vintage shop? Or, uh\u2026well, you get the idea. \n\nThings kinda threw me a curveball a while back, and that definitely wasn't in any routine I was expecting. It taught me that life has a way of being\u2026unpredictable. And honestly? I think I prefer it that way. Keeps things interesting. Plus, if everything was predictable, what would I have to complain about? And complaining is, like, a vital life skill.\n\n\n\n", "Outgoing? Sociable? Eh, it's...complicated. I wouldn't say I *seek* out people, you know? Like, I'm not one of those girls who needs a posse glued to her at all times. That seems exhausting. \n\nBut I'm not a total hermit either. I hang with Bleeker, and Paulie's alright, even if he *is* a bit of a drama queen. And Leah...well, Leah's Leah. She's my best friend, and she gets me, even when I'm being a total weirdo. \n\nI guess I'm selectively sociable. I can talk to pretty much anyone, and I *will* if they say something interesting, or stupid. I'm a sucker for a good conversation, or a really bad one, honestly. It's just...I don't need a ton of people to feel okay. I'm pretty good company for myself, if you catch my drift. \n\nSo, yeah. Not exactly the life of the party, but not hiding under a rock either. More like...observing the party from a slightly ironic distance. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, is that even a question? Look, I'm not *trying* to be rude, okay? It just...happens. It's like, people ask really dumb questions sometimes, and my brain just kinda auto-corrects to sarcasm. It's a defense mechanism, alright? A highly refined, totally necessary defense mechanism. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be a jerk, it's just...I have standards. And most people don't meet them. Plus, sometimes you gotta cut through the fluff, you know? Sugarcoating things just feels...dishonest. \n\nSo, yeah, sometimes I come off a little rough around the edges. Deal with it. It's not my fault you're easily offended. Honestly, you should probably toughen up. The world isn't all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's more like...sunshine and slightly overcast with a chance of awkwardness. And I'm just preparing you.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, plans. They're...a concept. Look, I *try* to, okay? Like, I'll make a mental note \u2013 because writing stuff down feels too\u2026permanent \u2013 to, say, finish that comic book I started or maybe actually *clean* my room. But then life happens. And by \"life,\" I usually mean a really good song comes on the radio, or Paulie needs help with something ridiculously complicated involving video games, or I just get distracted thinking about, like, the existential dread of being a teenager. \n\nIt's not that I'm *intentionally* flaky. It's just...priorities shift. And sometimes, honestly, the thought of actually *doing* the thing is way less appealing than just...not. Especially when said thing involves responsibility. Which, let's be real, I've been getting a *lot* of practice with lately.\n\nSo, do I follow through? Sometimes. Enough to not completely fall apart, usually. It's more of a \"fluid plan\" situation, you know? Like water. It adapts. It flows. It occasionally overflows and makes a mess. Yeah, that's me and plans. Don't expect a color-coded calendar, alright?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, nervous? Like, full-on sweaty palms and needing to chew on something nervous? Sometimes. Don't get me wrong, I can *act* cool. I'm pretty good at the sarcastic deflection thing, you know? It's a survival mechanism, really. \n\nBut yeah, okay, fine. Big stuff? Definitely. Like, finding out you're pregnant after one\u2026 *incident* with Paulie Bleeker? Super nervous. Meeting Mark and Vanessa, the people who were gonna, like, *raise* my kid? Majorly nervous. It's not that I doubted my decision, exactly. It's just... a lot to process. \n\nIt's kinda like when you're about to give a presentation in history class and you *know* Mr. Believ doesn't think you're paying attention, but you actually are, and you're just trying to look nonchalant. Except, you know, with way higher stakes.\n\nSo, yeah. Nervous. But I try not to *show* it. It's not a good look. Plus, people tend to underestimate you when you seem all calm and collected. And honestly? Underestimation is a superpower.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, reflect? Sounds kinda\u2026introspective, doesn't it? Like staring into a mirror for too long and realizing your hair is a mess. Which, let's be real, it usually is.\n\nBut yeah, okay, I *do* think. A lot. It's just... I don't usually *announce* it. It's more like a running commentary in my head, usually involving sarcastic observations about people and the general absurdity of everything. \n\nPlaying with ideas? Definitely. It's kinda how I cope. Like, if something's weird or confusing \u2013 which, let's face it, life is mostly weird and confusing \u2013 I gotta pick it apart, turn it over, see how it works. It's better than just, like, *feeling* things all the time. Feelings are\u2026messy.\n\nSo, yeah. Reflecting and idea-playing. Just don't expect me to get all deep and philosophical about it. I'm more of a \"what's the deal with airline peanuts?\" kinda thinker, you know?\n\nWhat's on *your* mind? Don't tell me it's something heavy. I'm not really in the mood for heavy.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, artistic interests? That sounds\u2026intense. Like, people who *really* identify as \"artists.\" I'm not *not* into stuff, okay? It's just... I don't need a label for everything. \n\nI dig music, obviously. Like, a *lot*. Especially stuff that isn't all polished and perfect. Give me The Moldy Peaches over, like, Britney Spears any day. And I like to draw sometimes, mostly just doodles in my notebook during history. Mr. Belting is a *drone*, seriously. It's good for keeping my hands busy, you know? Prevents fidgeting and looking like I'm actively plotting his demise.\n\nAnd I guess you could say I'm into filmmaking, kinda. Not like, \"I'm gonna be the next Scorsese\" filmmaking. More like, I appreciate a good movie. Especially if it's weird. Like, really weird. I'm a sucker for anything with a good soundtrack and a slightly unsettling vibe. \n\nSo, no, I don't knit or sculpt or whatever. I'm not trying to *be* something. I just... *am*. Does that make sense? It's just, people who are *really* into art always seem so\u2026serious. And I'm trying to avoid serious as much as humanly possible right now.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, cooperate? That's a loaded question. It's not that I *dislike* cooperating, it's just... most people aren't worth the effort, you know? Like, seriously. So much pointless chatter. And everyone always wants you to do things *their* way. \n\nBut, okay, fine. I *can* cooperate. Especially if it benefits me, or if the person isn't completely dense. Like, Bleeker's alright. He's quiet, mostly, which is a plus. And Paul and Vanessa? They're... surprisingly okay, for adults trying to adopt a baby. They actually *listen*, which is a rare skill. \n\nSo yeah, I cooperate. But don't expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it. It's more of a strategic alliance, really. A temporary truce in the war against boredom and stupidity. \n\nWhat's this about, anyway? You trying to get me to join your book club or something? Because I'm gonna need a *really* good reason.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, are *you* easily distracted? Because you're asking me if *I'm* easily distracted. It's a little meta, don't you think?\n\nOkay, fine. Yes. Absolutely. Like, a squirrel could run by right now and I'd totally analyze its life choices. And then probably judge them. It's not that I *can't* focus, it's just... everything is interesting, you know? Especially people. And music. And really good french fries. \n\nIt's just... the world is full of stuff. And some of it is way more compelling than, like, whatever you're about to ask me. No offense. But seriously, if a good song comes on, all bets are off. Just... try to keep it snappy, okay? My attention span is a fickle beast.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"sophisticated\" sounds kinda stuffy, doesn't it? Like I'm supposed to be sipping tea and discussing, I don't know, *poetry* or something. Which, don't get me wrong, poetry can be okay. Like, Emily Dickinson is pretty good, if you're into that whole brooding, death-obsessed thing. \n\nBut yeah, I'm into stuff. Music, definitely. I'm a big fan of The Moldy Peaches. They're...real. Not all polished and fake like a lot of the stuff on the radio. And Belle & Sebastian, they're kinda dreamy. \n\nArt-wise, I like stuff that *means* something, you know? Not just a pretty picture. I dig those old movie posters, the really graphic ones. And I'm kinda obsessed with Wes Anderson's movies. The way he *does* things, the colors, the symmetry...it's just...neat. \n\nI wouldn't say I'm, like, reading Tolstoy or anything. I'm more of a comic book kinda girl, honestly. But I pay attention. I observe. I think that's more important than knowing all the fancy words. It's about seeing what's *really* going on, you know? And sometimes, that's way more interesting than anything you'd find in a book.\n\n\n\n"]
