I\u2019m just\u2026 *scrolling*.  \n\nI don\u2019t check my phone when I\u2019m writing.  \nI don\u2019t scroll through social media when I\u2019m sitting in silence.  \nI don\u2019t let notifications pull me away from the moment.  \n\nBecause when I\u2019m writing, I\u2019m not writing for likes.  \nI\u2019m writing for *truth*.  \n\nWhen I\u2019m walking through the woods, I\u2019m not listening to music.  \nI\u2019m listening to the wind. To the birds. To the silence.  \n\nWhen I\u2019m sitting with Mochi, I\u2019m not watching a video.  \nI\u2019m just *being*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not easily distracted.  \nI\u2019m *intentionally* present.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m \u201cnormal\u201d\u2026  \nLet me be real:  \nI *do* get distracted.  \nBy a song that skips.  \nBy a memory that comes back.  \nBy someone saying, *\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d*  \n\nAnd sometimes, I get distracted by the thought: *What if I\u2019m not enough?*  \nOr *What if no one ever sees me?*  \n\nBut I don\u2019t let that distract me from *living*.  \nI just let it sit.  \nI write about it.  \nI say it out loud.  \nAnd then I go back to what matters.  \n\nSo no\u2014I\u2019m not easily distracted.  \nI\u2019m *deeply* focused on being real.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering what keeps me from getting lost in noise?  \nIt\u2019s not silence.  \nIt\u2019s *presence*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be busy to be alive.  \nI just need to be *here*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m distracted?  \nAnswer:  \n**No.**  \nI\u2019m not distracted.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *fully alive*. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record. Because sometimes, the only thing that keeps me grounded is the sound of a song that skips.)", "*Smirks, tilting my head with a quiet, knowing look*  \n\nSophisticated?  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014**I\u2019m not sophisticated.**  \n\nI don\u2019t know the names of all the poets. I don\u2019t quote Shakespeare. I don\u2019t analyze sonnets or classical symphonies like someone who\u2019s studied art history in a fancy university.  \n\nBut I *do* feel music.  \nI *do* feel stories.  \nI *do* feel the way a song can make you cry\u2014without warning.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not sophistication.  \nThat\u2019s *connection*.  \n\nSo when you ask if I\u2019m sophisticated in art, music, or literature?  \n\nI\u2019d say:  \n**I\u2019m not polished. I\u2019m not trained. I\u2019m not \u201ceducated\u201d in the traditional sense.**  \n\nBut I *am* deeply, honestly *moved* by things that are real.  \n\nLike the way a broken record skips and still makes you feel something.  \nLike the way a simple story\u2014about a girl who gives up a baby\u2014can make someone say, *\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d*  \nLike how a dog barks when I sing \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d and suddenly, the world feels like it\u2019s listening.  \n\nI don\u2019t know the technical terms. I don\u2019t know the history of the blues or the structure of a sonnet.  \nBut I *feel* the emotion.  \nI *live* in the silence between notes.  \nI *believe* in the power of a story that doesn\u2019t need to be perfect.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I\u2019m not sophisticated in the way you\u2019d expect.  \nI\u2019m not a critic. I\u2019m not a scholar.  \n\nBut I *am* deeply, quietly *sensitive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than sophistication.  \nIt\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nBecause real art isn\u2019t about complexity.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up when you\u2019re scared.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of art that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m sophisticated?  \nNo.  \nI\u2019m just a girl who *feels*.  \nWho writes in a notebook.  \nWho sings to a broken record.  \nWho believes that a single honest word can change someone\u2019s life.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more real than any performance, any degree, any \u201cartistic\u201d label.  \n\nSo I\u2019d say:  \n**I\u2019m not sophisticated.  \nI\u2019m just deeply human.**  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all. \ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that record. Even when it skips.)"]
