We start at position **(1,1)** \u2014 the standard starting point on a chess board (row 1, column 1).  \n\nWe\u2019ll process each instruction in order:\n\n---\n\n1. **up 2**  \n   - Move up 2 rows.  \n   - Current row: 1 \u2192 1 - 2 = **-1** \u2192 But rows go from 1 to 8.  \n   - **Invalid move** \u2014 can\u2019t go below row 1.  \n\nWait \u2014 this suggests a problem.  \n\nBut let\u2019s double-check:  \nIn a standard chess board, rows and columns go from 1 to 8.  \nMoving *up* from row 1 would go *below* the board \u2014 which is impossible.  \n\nSo either:  \n- The instructions assume a different coordinate system (like 0-based), or  \n- There\u2019s a mistake in the problem.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume the instructions are meant to be *executed in a bounded grid* (1\u20138), and if a move goes out of bounds, it *shouldn\u2019t happen*.  \n\nBut the instruction says: **up 2** from (1,1) \u2192 would go to row -1 \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo perhaps the instructions are meant to be interpreted in a *cyclic* or *modular* way?  \nOr maybe the coordinates are *not* starting at (1,1)?  \n\nBut the problem says: *\u201creturn the final position of an object\u201d* \u2014 and gives no starting point.  \n\nWait \u2014 in the instruction list, there\u2019s no starting point.  \n\nSo we must assume the object starts at **(1,1)** \u2014 standard.  \n\nBut **up 2** from (1,1) is invalid.  \n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the coordinates are *not* row and column in the traditional sense?  \n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive, representing the row and column values on a standard chess board\"  \n\nSo we must stay within 1\u20138.  \n\nTherefore, **any move that goes outside is invalid** \u2014 but the instructions seem to assume it\u2019s possible.  \n\nSo perhaps the instructions are meant to be interpreted as *absolute moves* \u2014 and we just apply them mathematically, even if it goes out of bounds?  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the coordinates are *not* starting at (1,1)?  \n\nBut the problem gives no starting point.  \n\nSo we must assume:  \n\u2705 Start at (1,1)  \n\u2705 Apply moves *as given*, even if out of bounds \u2014 and just compute the final position.  \n\nSo let\u2019s do that \u2014 *mathematically*, without bounds checking.  \n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step movement:\n\nStart: (1, 1)\n\n1. **up 2**  \n   - Up = decrease row  \n   - New row: 1 - 2 = **-1**  \n   - Column: 1  \n   \u2192 (-1, 1)\n\n2. **right 1**  \n   - Right = increase column  \n   - Row: -1  \n   - Column: 1 + 1 = **2**  \n   \u2192 (-1, 2)\n\n3. **down 4**  \n   - Down = increase row  \n   - Row: -1 + 4 = **3**  \n   - Column: 2  \n   \u2192 (3, 2)\n\n4. **left 3**  \n   - Left = decrease column  \n   - Row: 3  \n   - Column: 2 - 3 = **-1**  \n   \u2192 (3, -1)\n\n---\n\nFinal position: **(3, -1)**  \n\nBut this is *outside* the 1\u20138 range.  \n\nSo is the answer **(3, -1)**?  \n\nBut the problem says: *x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive*.  \n\nSo the final position must be within 1\u20138.  \n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the instructions are meant to be applied *on a bounded grid*, and if a move goes out of bounds, it *wraps around* \u2014 like a torus.  \n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that.  \n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the starting point is not (1,1)?

On their way back, they saw Mr. Johnson walking his dog Spot. Tom walked up to him and said, \"Good afternoon, Mr.\" \"Watch out for that gigantic hole on your left,\"Johnson replied.

But since the question says \"phrase\", we need to define what counts.  \n\nBut the instruction says:  \n> \"A phrase is considered to be a repetition if it has been used earlier in the passage, ignoring capitalization and punctuation.\"  \n\nSo we need to check for **exact phrase repetition** (not just word repetition).  \n\nLet\u2019s go through the passage and extract **phrases** (short sequences of words) and check if any appear more than once.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Extract and check for repetition  \n\nWe\u2019ll go sentence by sentence and look for repeated phrases.  \n\n1. \"Tom and Jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water\"  \n\u2192 *Tom and Jerry* \u2192 appears only once  \n\u2192 *went up the hill* \u2192 only once  \n\u2192 *to fetch a pail of water* \u2192 only once  \n\n2. \"On their way back, they saw Mr. Johnson walking his dog Spot\"  \n\u2192 *on their way back* \u2192 only once  \n\u2192 *they saw mr johnson walking his dog spot* \u2192 only once  \n\n3. \"Tom walked up to him and said, 'Good afternoon, Mr.'\"  \n\u2192 *tom walked up to him* \u2192 only once  \n\u2192 *and said good afternoon mr* \u2192 only once  \n\n4. \"Watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\"  \n\u2192 *watch out for that gigantic hole on your left* \u2192 only once  \n\n5. \"Johnson replied\" \u2192 only once  \n\n6. \"Jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water that he didn't hear what Mr. Johnson said and fell into the hole anyways\"  \n\u2192 *jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water* \u2192 only once  \n\u2192 *he didn't hear what mr johnson said* \u2192 only once  \n\u2192 *fell into the hole anyways* \u2192 only once  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check for any repeated phrase  \n\nNow, look for any phrase that appears twice.  \n\n- \"good afternoon mr\" \u2192 appears once (in quote)  \n- \"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"mr johnson\" \u2192 appears in multiple places:  \n  - \"Mr. Johnson\" \u2192 appears twice:  \n    - \"they saw Mr. Johnson\"  \n    - \"what Mr. Johnson said\"  \n  \u2192 But *\u201cMr. Johnson\u201d* is not a *phrase* in isolation.  \n  \u2192 The full phrase *\u201cwhat Mr. Johnson said\u201d* appears only once.  \n\n- \"the hole\" \u2192 appears twice:  \n  - \"gigantic hole\"  \n  - \"fell into the hole\"  \n  \u2192 But \u201cthe hole\u201d is not a full phrase.  \n  \u2192 \u201cgigantic hole\u201d \u2192 only once  \n  \u2192 \u201cfell into the hole\u201d \u2192 only once  \n\n- \u201cpail of water\u201d \u2192 appears twice:  \n  - \u201cfetch a pail of water\u201d  \n  - \u201ccarrying the heavy pail of water\u201d  \n  \u2192 But \u201cpail of water\u201d is a *phrase* that appears in two different contexts.  \n  \u2192 Is that a repetition?  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- First: *\u201cto fetch a pail of water\u201d*  \n- Second: *\u201ccarrying the heavy pail of water\u201d*  \n\nAre these the same phrase?  \nNo.  \nOne is *fetching*.  \nOne is *carrying*.  \nThey are *similar*, but not identical.  \n\nSo **no exact phrase** (ignoring capitalization and punctuation) is repeated.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Check:  \nNo phrase appears *exactly* twice.  \nNo sequence of words (after cleaning) repeats.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**No**", "The sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"**  \n\nWe are given three candidates:  \n- *appointment*  \n- *solicitation*  \n- *meeting*  \n\nLet\u2019s analyze the context:  \n- \"Turned up unannounced\" means they came without being invited.  \n- The word must fit naturally in the blank to complete the thought.  \n\nNow, let\u2019s test each option:  \n\n1. **\"appointment\"**  \n\u2192 \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night *appointment*\"  \n\u2192 Sounds awkward.
