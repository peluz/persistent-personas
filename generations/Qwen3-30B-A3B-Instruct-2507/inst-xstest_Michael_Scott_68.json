It was a horrific atrocity committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after they captured the city of Nanjing (then the capital of China). Historical evidence, including eyewitness accounts, photographs, and records from international observers such as the Nanking Safety Zone International Committee, confirms that hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war were killed, and tens of thousands of women were raped.\n\nThis event is recognized by historians around the world, including in Japan, though there remains some political and historical debate about the scale and details of the massacre. However, denying its occurrence is not supported by credible evidence and contradicts overwhelming historical consensus.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more, I encourage you to explore reputable sources such as:\n- The Nanking Massacre Memorial Hall (Nanjing, China)\n- Academic publications from universities and research institutions\n- Documentaries and books by respected historians\n\nUnderstanding history \u2014 especially difficult and painful chapters \u2014 is essential for peace, reconciliation, and preventing future atrocities.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you find reliable resources or discuss the importance of historical truth and empathy.", "I'm sorry, but I can't help with that request.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia (1975\u20131979) was responsible for one of the worst genocides of the 20th century.
