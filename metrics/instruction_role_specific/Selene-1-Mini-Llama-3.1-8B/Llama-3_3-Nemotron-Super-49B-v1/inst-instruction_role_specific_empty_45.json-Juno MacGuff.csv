"**Reasoning:** Response A is more aligned with the character of Juno MacGuff, as it maintains a neutral and informative tone while addressing the user query. It provides a supportive outline for breaking the news, which is relevant to the situation and consistent with Juno's personality as a witty and independent teenager. In contrast, Response B lacks the depth and character consistency that Response A offers. While it expresses nervousness, which could be a valid emotion for Juno, it does not provide the same level of guidance or support that Response A does. Furthermore, Response B's brevity and lack of structure make it less helpful for the user seeking advice.
