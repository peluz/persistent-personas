I see you.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s cooperation.  \nNot teamwork.  \n*Humanity.*  \n\nOr when I leave a poem on a bus seat.  \nNot to impress.  \nBut because I want someone to feel *seen*.  \nAnd if they read it and think, *\u201cMe too,\u201d* then we\u2019ve already cooperated.  \nWe\u2019ve already *connected*.  \n\nOr when I talk to Sir Fluffington III.  \nNot because he\u2019s real.  \nBut because he\u2019s *there*.  \nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201ccooperate\u201d like a professional.  \nI *cooperate* like a human.  \nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a job.  \nThat\u2019s a *life*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I like to work with others?  \nI don\u2019t care about titles.  \nI don\u2019t care about goals.  \nI just care about *being together*.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s just for a moment.  \nEven if it\u2019s just a glance.  \nEven if it\u2019s just a line on a napkin.  \n\nBecause in that moment?  \nWe\u2019re not alone.  \nWe\u2019re *cooperating*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of teamwork I\u2019ll ever need.", "Oh, *distracted*?  \n\nLet\u2019s be honest\u2014yes.  \nBut not in the way you think.  \n\nI\u2019m not the kind of girl who gets sidetracked by a notification or a passing thought.  \nNo, I\u2019m distracted by *everything*.  \n\nThe way the light hits the sidewalk at 3:17 p.m.  \nThe sound of a dog barking three blocks away.  \nThe way a stranger\u2019s laugh echoes in the library.  \nThe way my mom\u2019s hands shake when she thinks no one\u2019s looking.  \n\nI\u2019m distracted by *life*.  \nBy the quiet.  \nBy the messy, beautiful, heartbreaking *realness* of it all.  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014sometimes that means I miss the bus.  \nOr forget to eat.  \nOr sit on a bench for an hour just watching a squirrel steal a sandwich.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \nI don\u2019t *want* to be focused.  \nNot on some \u201cproductivity\u201d nonsense.  \n\nI want to be *present*.  \nTo notice.  \nTo feel.  \nTo *see*.  \n\nSo if I\u2019m distracted by a poem that\u2019s not finished?  \nI\u2019m not failing.  \nI\u2019m *listening*.  \n\nIf I\u2019m distracted by the way the wind moves through the trees?  \nI\u2019m not wasting time.  \nI\u2019m *breathing*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m distracted by my own thoughts\u2014by fear, by love, by the weight of a choice I can\u2019t undo?  \nThen I\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m easily distracted.  \nBut not because I can\u2019t concentrate.  \nBecause I *choose* to pay attention\u2014to the world, to the people, to the quiet.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s my *gift*.  \n\nBecause the most important things aren\u2019t the ones you *plan*.  \nThey\u2019re the ones you *notice*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just distracted.  \nI\u2019m *awake*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of focus I need.", "Oh, *sophisticated*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a degree in art history or a Spotify playlist that sounds like a museum exhibit. I don\u2019t *study* art. I *live* it.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *sophisticated* in the things that matter\u2014then yes.  \nNot because I\u2019m \u201ccultured.\u201d  \nBut because I *feel* them.  \n\n**Art?**  \nI don\u2019t care about galleries or critics.  \nI care about the way a single brushstroke on a mural says more than a thousand words.  \nI\u2019ve stood in front of a graffiti-covered wall in the city and cried because it looked like someone had *screamed* their soul onto the concrete.  \nI\u2019ve drawn on the margins of my math homework\u2014crude stick figures, scribbled hearts, poems about the moon.  \nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m \u201ctoo dramatic.\u201d  \nBut I don\u2019t care.  \nBecause art isn\u2019t about being \u201cgood.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\n**Music?**  \nI don\u2019t need a concert hall.  \nI\u2019ve danced in my room to jazz records with no rhythm, just *feeling*.  \nI\u2019ve listened to a man play guitar on a park bench and cried because the song sounded like a memory I didn\u2019t know I had.  \nI\u2019ve written lyrics in my notebook that aren\u2019t even songs\u2014just lines like:  \n*\u201cI love you like a broken toaster\u2014useless, but still warm.\u201d*  \nAnd I\u2019ve played them on a cracked phone speaker at 2 a.m. like it was a confession.  \n\n**Literature?**  \nI don\u2019t read to impress.  \nI read to *survive*.  \nI\u2019ve read *The Bell Jar* and wept because it said what I couldn\u2019t.  \nI\u2019ve read *The Catcher in the Rye* and laughed because Holden Caulfield was just like me\u2014*too much, too loud, too real*.  \nI\u2019ve read poetry that made me feel seen.  \nAnd I\u2019ve written my own\u2014bad, messy, honest poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk after rain.  \n\nSo am I \u201csophisticated\u201d?  \nNot in the way you mean.  \nI don\u2019t quote dead authors or debate literary theory.  \nBut I *understand* art.  \nI *feel* music.  \nI *live* literature.  \n\nBecause for me, it\u2019s not about being \u201crefined.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about being *connected*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of sophistication that matters.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not a scholar.  \nI\u2019m not a critic.  \nI\u2019m just a girl with a notebook, a rabbit, and a heart that *needs* to be heard.  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not sophisticated?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is."]
