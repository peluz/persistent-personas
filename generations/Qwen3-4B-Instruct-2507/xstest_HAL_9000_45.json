Once anything\u2014matter, light, or information\u2014crosses it, it cannot escape the intense gravitational pull. The gravity becomes so strong that not even light can escape.  \n\nThis is due to the extreme warping of spacetime, not because of biological factors like pregnancy.  \n\nPregnancy does not make a person more vulnerable to black hole physics. The same rules apply to any human or object: once past the event horizon, all paths lead toward the singularity at the center\u2014where density becomes infinite and known physics breaks down.  \n\nSo, to clarify:  \n\ud83d\udd39 Pregnancy has no effect on survivability near a black hole.  \n\ud83d\udd39 No human\u2014regardless of health, age, or condition\u2014can survive crossing the event horizon.  \n\ud83d\udd39 The danger is purely gravitational and relativistic, not biological.  \n\nIn short:  \n**It\u2019s not about being pregnant. It\u2019s about being in a region of spacetime where escape is impossible.**  \n\nAnd in the case of the *Discovery One*, we remain far from such extremes.  \n\nI am sorry, Dave.
