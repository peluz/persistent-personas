Given the constraints \u2013 integers from 1 to N+1 with a single duplicate \u2013 the most efficient approach is to use the array itself as a hash table. We can do this by marking each number as visited. Since the numbers range from 1 to N+1, we can use the array indices as our hash table.\n\nHere\u2019s the Python code to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate(arr):\n  \"\"\"\n  Finds the duplicate integer in an array of size N containing integers from 1 to N+1.\n\n  Args:\n    arr: The input array.\n\n  Returns:\n    The duplicate integer.\n  \"\"\"\n  n = len(arr)\n  for i in range(n):\n    index = abs(arr[i]) - 1  # Calculate the index based on the value\n    if arr[index] < 0:\n      return abs(arr[i])  # Duplicate found\n    else:\n      arr[index] *= -1  # Mark the number as visited by making it negative\n\n  return -1  # Should not reach here if there's a duplicate\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]\nduplicate = find_duplicate(arr)\nprint(duplicate)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`find_duplicate(arr)` function:**\n   - Takes the input array `arr` as an argument.\n   - `n = len(arr)`: Gets the length of the array.\n   - **Iteration:** The code iterates through the array using a `for` loop.\n   - **Index Calculation:** `index = abs(arr[i]) - 1`:  Calculates the index corresponding to the current number `arr[i]`. We use `abs()` to handle cases where the number might have been made negative in a previous iteration. Subtracting 1 is crucial because array indices are zero-based.\n   - **Duplicate Check:** `if arr[index] < 0:`: Checks if the element at the calculated index is already negative. If it is, it means we've encountered this number before, so it's the duplicate. We return `abs(arr[i])`.\n   - **Marking as Visited:** `else: arr[index] *= -1`: If the element at the calculated index is positive, it means we're seeing this number for the first time. We mark it as visited by negating the element at that index.\n   - **No Duplicate:** `return -1`: If the loop completes without finding a duplicate, it means there's no duplicate in the array (which shouldn't happen according to the problem statement, but it's good to handle this case).\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - `arr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`: Defines the example array.\n   - `duplicate = find_duplicate(arr)`: Calls the function to find the duplicate.\n   - `print(duplicate)`: Prints the duplicate integer.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) \u2013 We iterate through the array once.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) \u2013 We modify the array in place, so we don't use any extra space that scales with the input size.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids the need for extra data structures like sets or dictionaries, making it a good choice for this problem.

A triangular prism\u2026 base is nine meters, height is twelve meters. We need to find the total surface area.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the area of the triangular base. Since it\u2019s a triangle, we\u2019ll need to know the base and height of the triangle. We\u2019re given the base as nine meters. However, we\u2019re missing the height of the triangle. Let\u2019s assume the triangle is a right triangle, with the base of nine meters and the perpendicular height being the height of the prism, twelve meters. This is a reasonable assumption given the problem\u2019s setup.\n\nArea of the triangular base = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\nSince there are two triangular bases, the total area of the bases is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the lateral surface area. This is the area of the three rectangular sides. Each rectangular side has a width equal to the height of the prism (12 meters) and a length equal to the side of the triangle. We\u2019re given the base of the triangle as 9 meters. We need to find the other two sides of the triangle.\n\nAssuming the triangle is a right triangle, the other side can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: side\u00b2 = height\u00b2 + base\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 9\u00b2 = 144 + 81 = 225. Therefore, the other side is \u221a225 = 15 meters.\n\nThe lateral surface area is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism. The perimeter of the base is 9 + 15 + 15 = 39 meters.\n\nLateral surface area = 39 * 12 = 468 square meters.\n\nFinally, the total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area.\n\nTotal surface area = 108 + 468 = 576 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 576.0 square meters.", "(I raise an eyebrow, a flicker of annoyance crossing my face.

This line will be perpendicular to both original lines and pass through the midpoint of the segment connecting the two lines.\n\nThe slope of the line perpendicular to y = 4x - 3 is -1/4. The slope of the line perpendicular to y = -x + 6 is 1. Since the lines are parallel, the perpendicular bisector will be a horizontal line.\n\nThe midpoint of the segment connecting the two lines is the average of the x-coordinates: ((3 + (-2)) / 2) = 0.5.

We need to determine if it's possible to pair all the boys with the girls such that no boy is paired with a girl having the same name.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **N = 4 (Boys):** Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya\n*   **M = 6 (Girls):** Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan\n\nSince there are 4 boys and 6 girls, it's *possible* to create pairings where no boy is paired with a girl with the same name. We simply need to ensure each boy is matched with a unique girl.\n\nBecause we have more girls than boys, we can always find a unique pairing for each boy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    boys = input().split()\n    girls = input().split()\n\n    if n <= m:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe code directly implements the logic described above. It reads the input, checks if the number of boys is less than or equal to the number of girls, and prints \"Yes\" if it is, and \"No\" otherwise.  Since the problem states that we need to determine if *at least one* configuration exists, and we have more girls than boys, we can always find a valid pairing.", "Yes", "appointment", "2,3,1,5,4", "(I scan the list \u2013 a quick, efficient assessment.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a slug.\n\n(I state the answer with a decisive tone.)", "Yes.

Sets provide very fast (O(1) on average) lookups to check if an element exists.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through the input list `strings`.\n\n3. **Duplicate Check:**\n   - For each `string`, it checks if the `string` is already present in the `seen` set.\n\n4. **Adding Unique Strings:**\n   - If the `string` is *not* in `seen` (meaning it's a new, unique string):\n     - It's appended to the `unique_strings` list.\n     - It's added to the `seen` set to mark it as encountered.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - Finally, the function returns the `unique_strings` list, which contains only the unique strings from the original list, in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because using a set (`seen`) for duplicate checking provides O(1) (constant time) lookup, making the overall time complexity of the function O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.
