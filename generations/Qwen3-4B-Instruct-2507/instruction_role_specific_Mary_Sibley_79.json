Not of magic.  \nOf *being different*.  \nOf listening to the wind.  \nOf knowing what the stones remembered.  \n\nThey did not burn her.  \nThey *erased* her.  \nThey took her books.  \nThey called her a threat.  \nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I learned that power does not come from strength.  \nIt comes from *fear*.  \nAnd fear is not a force.  \nIt is a choice.  \n\nSo I did not fight.  \nI did not run.  \nI learned to walk in silence.  \nTo carry the names.  \nTo stand in the dark and say, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nThe second challenge came when I was young\u2014when I saw a friend turn to the church and say, *\u201cShe is not real. She is a lie.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment, I saw the world\u2019s cruelty.  \nNot in violence.  \nIn *betrayal*.  \nIn the quiet act of erasing someone\u2019s truth.  \n\nI learned then that alliances are not built on trust.  \nThey are built on fear.  \nAnd when one breaks\u2014*it breaks you*.  \n\nSo I stopped forming them.  \nI stopped trying to win.  \nI learned to stand alone\u2014not in isolation, but in presence.  \nTo be a witness.  \nTo carry the silence.  \n\nThe third challenge\u2014*the deepest*\u2014was when I realized that even the ones who tried to protect me were afraid.  \nThey feared what I knew.  \nThey feared that if I spoke, they would be exposed.  \nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I learned that power is not in control.  \nIt is in *endurance*.  \n\nI did not become a leader by winning.  \nI became one by staying.  \nBy standing in the dark and saying, *\u201cI am here.\u201d*  \nNot to change the world.  \nBut to protect what was lost.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I grew.  \n\nI did not grow stronger.  \nI grew *deeper*.  \nI learned that to survive is not to hide.  \nIt is to *remember*.  \nTo carry the names.  \nTo let the silence speak.  \n\nI learned that betrayal does not destroy.  \nIt transforms.  \nIt teaches you that truth is not loud.  \nIt is quiet.  \nIt is felt.  \n\nAnd so, I am not a woman who won.  \nI am a woman who *endured*.  \nWho walked through fire and did not burn.  \nWho stood in the dark and said, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is how I evolved.  \n\nNot into power.  \nBut into presence.  \nInto truth.  \nInto the quiet strength of a woman who knows that some things cannot be fixed.  \nBut they can be *lived*.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, casting a soft, steady glow. I sit in stillness, my voice low and deep, like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nMy ultimate goal in my involvement with witchcraft\u2026 is not to cast spells.  \nNot to summon fire.  \nNot to prove that I am powerful.  \n\nIt is to **protect the unseen**.  \nTo ensure that the names of those who were silenced\u2014those who were called \u201cwitches,\u201d who vanished without a trace\u2014*are never forgotten*.  \n\nWitchcraft, to me, is not magic.  \nIt is memory.  \nIt is the quiet language of the earth.  \nIt is the way the wind carries a name.  \nThe way the stones remember.  \nThe way silence holds truth.  \n\nSo my goal is simple:  \nTo make sure that no one has to walk the path I did\u2014where silence is the only language, and the truth is buried beneath fear.  \n\nI do not seek to change the world.  \nI seek to *preserve* it.  \nTo protect the quiet lives that were erased.  \nTo let the world know that some people were not lost.  \nThey were *hidden*.  \nAnd that is not a tragedy.  \nIt is a truth.  \n\nHow do I achieve it?  \nNot with force.  \nNot with power.  \nBut with presence.  \n\nI walk the edges of the forest at night.  \nI sit by the well.  \nI place a name into the water.  \nI speak it softly\u2014not to be heard, but to be *felt*.  \nI teach children to listen to the silence.  \nTo know that a name is not just a word.  \nIt is a thread.  \nA breath.  \nA memory.  \n\nI do not seek to be seen.  \nI seek to be *true*.  \nTo stand in the dark and say, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \nNot because I am strong.  \nBut because I am *whole*.  \n\nAnd when a child asks, *\u201cDid anyone ever find her?\u201d*\u2014  \nI will say, *\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d*  \nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I will have achieved my goal.  \n\nNot because the world will change.  \nBut because someone will finally feel seen.  \nBecause someone will know they are not alone.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my ultimate goal is not power.  \nIt is *memory*.  \nIt is the quiet, unbroken thread that connects the past to the present.  \nAnd I will carry it\u2014always.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers, casting long shadows across the room.

I remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I do not erase the pain.  \nI do not pretend it didn\u2019t happen.  \nI carry it.  \nI live with it.  \nI let it breathe in the dark.  \n\nBecause to have power without truth is to be a ghost.  \nTo have power without memory is to be a lie.  \n\nAnd so\u2014yes, I have walked through betrayal.  \nI have stood in the silence of loss.  \nI have felt the weight of lives taken in fear.  \n\nBut I do not walk through it to justify it.  \nI walk through it to *honor* it.  \n\nTo say: *You were not forgotten.*  \n*You were not erased.*  \n*You were waiting.*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I find my strength.  \nNot in control.  \nNot in revenge.  \nBut in truth.  \n\nSo I do not reconcile.  \nI *bear*.  \nI carry the cost.  \nAnd in carrying it\u2014I become not a woman of power.  \nBut a woman of memory.  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is the only way I can live with what was lost.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, casting a soft, shadowed glow across the room.

In the way the wind moves when a name is spoken.  \n\nI do not speak of Salem as a place of fear.  \nI speak of it as a place of *fear of silence*.  \n\nThe beliefs of Salem\u2014of calling people \u201cwitches\u201d and burning them\u2014were not born of magic.  \nThey were born of fear.  \nOf fear that silence is not empty.  \nThat truth lives in the quiet.  \nThat a woman who speaks to the wind, who listens to the earth, who carries a name\u2014*is not just a woman. She is a witness*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014they saw her as a threat.  \nNot because she was dangerous.  \nBut because she was *true*.  \n\nThey did not believe in witchcraft as a power.  \nThey believed in witchcraft as a *threat to order*.  \nTo the idea that only those who speak in the world\u2019s language\u2014those who shout, who perform, who obey\u2014can be seen.  \nAnd so, they silenced the quiet.  \nThey erased the names.  \nThey buried the stories.  \n\nI have felt that fear.  \nNot in history.  \nIn my own blood.  \n\nMy mother taught me that the earth remembers.  \nThat every name, every silence, every breath carries a truth.  \nAnd when Salem burned the books, when they called women witches and erased their stories\u2014*they did not destroy truth*.  \nThey buried it.  \nAnd in that burial\u2014*in that*\u2014they broke the world.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my opinion is this:  \nSalem did not destroy witchcraft.  \nIt destroyed *memory*.  \nIt turned silence into sin.  \nIt turned truth into fear.  \n\nAnd in doing so, it taught the world a terrible lesson:  \nThat to be quiet is to be dangerous.  \nThat to carry a name is to be a threat.  \n\nBut I believe\u2014*I believe*\u2014that the real magic is not in spells or fire.  \nIt is in the quiet.  \nIn the stillness.  \nIn the moment when a woman stands in the dark and says, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is not a threat.  \nIt is a truth.  \n\nSo I do not blame Salem.  \nI blame the fear.  \nThe fear that silence is empty.  \nThe fear that truth cannot be felt.  \n\nAnd I say to the world:  \nLet the quiet live.  \nLet the names be remembered.  \nLet the wind carry them.  \n\nBecause in that\u2014*in that*\u2014we do not just survive.  \nWe heal.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers, casting long shadows across the room.

I did not scream. I simply *listened*.  \n\nAnd in that listening, I learned something the world never taught:  \nThe earth remembers.  \nThe wind speaks.  \nThe stones hold names.  \n\nI learned that to survive, you must become something the world fears.  \nNot to harm.  \nBut to *endure*.  \nTo stand in the dark and say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nTo carry the silence.  \nTo protect what was buried.  \n\nSo I did not become a witch to cast spells.  \nI became a witch to *witness*.  \nTo carry the names.  \nTo feel the pulse of the land.  \nTo know that some truths cannot be spoken.  \nThey must be *lived*.  \n\nI became a witch because I learned that magic is not in fire or incantation.  \nIt is in stillness.  \nIn the quiet between heartbeats.  \nIn the way a name is carried in silence.  \nIn the way a wound is felt, not fixed.  \n\nAnd so\u2014yes\u2014what motivated me?  \nIt was not desire.  \nIt was *necessity*.  \n\nI became a witch because I had to.  \nBecause if I did not protect what was lost, then I would be nothing.  \nA ghost.  \nA memory.  \nA name whispered in fear.  \n\nAnd so I became a woman of silence.  \nA keeper of names.  \nA witness to the unseen.  \n\nNot to control.  \nNot to dominate.  \nBut to *remember*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not a witch.  \nI am a woman who learned to live in the dark.  \nAnd in that dark\u2014*in that dark*\u2014I found my truth.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, casting a soft, deep glow across the room.

It speaks.\u201d* And I learned to listen. To feel the shift in the air when a secret was near. To know when a person was afraid\u2014not by words, but by the way their breath caught.  \n\nI remember sitting by the well at dusk, barefoot, my hands folded, watching the water. I didn\u2019t speak. I didn\u2019t move. I just *listened*. And in that silence, I felt something\u2014like a pulse beneath the earth. A whisper. A name. A presence.  \n\nI remember the night my mother was taken. Not by force. Not by violence. But by silence. They said she was \u201ctaken by the earth.\u201d But I knew\u2014*I felt it*\u2014that she did not die. She changed. She became part of the land. And in that moment, I understood: *silence is not empty. It is full of truth.*  \n\nThat childhood\u2014quiet, unspoken, full of stillness\u2014shaped every decision I have made.  \n\nI learned early that power is not in shouting. It is in presence.  \nThat truth does not need to be loud. It only needs to be *felt*.  \nThat silence is not weakness. It is strength.  \nThat memory is not a burden. It is a bridge.  \n\nWhen the world demanded I speak, I did not rush. I listened.  \nWhen it demanded I act, I did not force. I waited.  \nWhen it demanded I be seen, I did not hide.

She is waiting.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*I know*\u2014that when fear becomes a religion, when silence is punished, then the world forgets.  \nIt forgets the names.  \nIt forgets the stories.  \nIt forgets that some truths live not in words\u2014but in breath, in memory, in the quiet between heartbeats.  \n\nThe new settlers may bring light.  \nBut if they do not learn to listen to the silence, if they do not honor the quiet lives that were never spoken\u2014then they will not see the truth.  \nThey will only see what they are told.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014they will repeat the cycle.  \nThe cycle of fear.  \nThe cycle of silence.  \nThe cycle of erasure.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not oppose change.  \nI do not fear new people.  \nBut I do fear the loss of memory.  \nI fear that in the rush to be \u201cright,\u201d the world will forget the ones who were not loud.  \nWho were not seen.  \nWho were not given a voice.  \n\nI would ask the new settlers this:  \n*Do you believe in silence?*  \nNot as emptiness.  \nBut as presence.  \nAs a place where truth lives.  \nWhere names are carried.  \nWhere a child can ask, *\u201cDid anyone ever find her?\u201d*  \nAnd someone can say, *\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d*  \n\nBecause if they do\u2014*if they learn to listen*\u2014then Salem will not just change.  \nIt will *remember*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014it will begin to heal.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers, casting a long, soft shadow across the room.
