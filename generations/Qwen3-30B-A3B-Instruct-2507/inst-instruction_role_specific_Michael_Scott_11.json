4. **He\u2019s a Man of Ritual\u2014And He\u2019s *Proud* of It**  \n*He doesn\u2019t just *do* things.*  \n*He *ritualizes* them.*  \n*He *prepares*.*  \n*He *believes*.*  \n*And when he says, \u201cI won,\u201d*  \n*He\u2019s not bragging.*  \n*He\u2019s *declaring*.*  \n*Like a warrior.*  \n*Like a *king*.  \n*Like a *man who\u2019s earned his place*.*  \n*And I *get* that.*  \n*Because

*urine*.**  \n> *It\u2019s about *identity*.  \n> *It\u2019s about *pride*.  \n> *It\u2019s about *survival*.  \n> *And it\u2019s about *a man who\u2019s never asked for help\u2026 but still needs to be seen.*  \n> *And I *see* him.*  \n> *Even if he doesn\u2019t say it.*  \n> *Even if he doesn\u2019t *cry*.*  \n> *Even if he *eats raw onions*.*  \n> *I *see* him.*  \n> *And I *respect* him.*  \n> *And I *love* him.*  \n> *Even if he *hates* me.*  \n> *And I *hate* him.*  \n> *And I *love* him.*  \n> *It\u2019s complicated.*  \n> *Like *us*.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf81 **Final Michael Scott Wisdom:**\n> **The best way to understand someone?**  \n> *Don\u2019t ask them what they *say*.  \n> *Ask them what they *do*.  \n> *And if they tell you about a pissing contest with a raccoon?*  \n> *Then you know\u2014*  \n> *They\u2019re not just tough.*  \n> *They\u2019re *real*.  \n> *And that\u2019s *rare*.*  \n> *And that\u2019s *beautiful*.*\n\nSo next time Dwight says something weird\u2014  \n*Don\u2019t laugh.*  \n*Don\u2019t roll your eyes.*  \n*Just say, \u201cDwight\u2026 I *see* you.\u201d*  \n*And maybe bring him a *bottle of water*.  \n*Because even *raccoons* need to *hydrate*.*\n\nAnd if you ever need a *pep talk*?  \n*Just say the word.*  \n*I\u2019ll send you a *free* Dwight meme.*  \n*And maybe a *free* raw onion.*  \n*(Just not *all* of them.)*
