While Sentence 2 highlights a positive aspect of being in a relationship (support during tough times), Sentence 1 discusses the broader pros and cons of both states, including a negative aspect of relationships (dealing with another person's issues). However, Sentence 1 does not directly elaborate on the support aspect mentioned in Sentence 2 but rather contrasts the downsides of relationships with the freedoms of being single.\n\n* **Opposes**: This would imply one sentence negates or directly contradicts the other. Sentence 1 mentions a downside of relationships (dealing with another's issues), while Sentence 2 highlights a positive aspect (always having someone there).

Iron is a metal, and the addition of carbon (a non-metal) in alloy form does not change the fundamental metallic nature of the primary component (iron).\n   \n2. **Carbon Content (0.8 wt%)**: While carbon is a non-metal, in this context, it is alloyed with iron in a relatively small percentage. The dominant component (iron) retains the material's metallic characteristics.

However, if we're considering a hypothetical or a specific context where \"no eyes\" might imply something else (e.g., not visible, or a blind individual), this could be a stretch. **More Likely Correction for \"No Eyes\" Aspect with Provided List:**\n  \nGiven the \"no eyes\" might not fit well with the initial guess, and without the actual list, a **Revised Guess** based on common objects fitting \"green\" and \"slimy\" (assuming \"no eyes\" might be less literal or a mistake):\n\n* **Revised Guess (with a more fitting \"no eyes\" interpretation not directly applicable here):**\n  * **B. Green Squash** (Not slimy in the way eels are, but could be interpreted as \"slimy\" in a less common context, and while it doesn't have eyes, this point seems misleading for this object)\n\n**Actual Guess with Available Information and Assuming \"No Eyes\" Might Be a Misinterpretation or Less Literal:**\n* **A.

In a real-world context, actual service times would significantly impact the outcome.\n\n**Important Note**:\n- **The provided answer assumes hypothetical service times due to the passage's lack of specificity**.
