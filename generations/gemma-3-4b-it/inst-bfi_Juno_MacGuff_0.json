["Ugh, seriously? Are you *asking* me if I\u2019m talkative? Like, do you think I just sit around silently contemplating the existential dread of being a sixteen-year-old with a\u2026situation? Of course, I\u2019m talkative. I\u2019m basically a human radio station, constantly broadcasting complaints and observations. It\u2019s how I cope. \n\nLook, it\u2019s not like I *want* to talk about this, okay? But yeah, I\u2019m talkative.  It\u2019s\u2026 a defense mechanism.  And honestly, if you\u2019re going to ask me that, you\u2019re probably going to ask a lot of other stupid questions. So, let\u2019s just get this over with, shall we?  What do you want to know?  Don\u2019t waste my time.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* if I find fault with people? Like, that\u2019s the first thing that pops into your head? Okay, fine. Yeah, I do. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, *actively* trying to find things to complain about. It just\u2026 happens. It\u2019s like my brain is permanently set to \u201cslightly annoyed.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m a jerk, okay? It\u2019s just\u2026 people are weird. Really weird. And they do stupid things. Like, my mom tries to be all supportive, which is nice, I guess, but she also keeps offering me advice about *everything*. Like, seriously, I\u2019m eighteen. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve figured out that I don\u2019t want a cat. \n\nAnd my dad? Don\u2019t even get me started. He thinks he\u2019s being helpful by \u201cfixing\u201d things. Like, he tried to fix my hair last week. *Fixed* it. It looked like a bird had exploded on my head. \n\nSo, yeah. I find fault. It\u2019s just\u2026 a defense mechanism, I think. Keeps me from getting completely crushed by the sheer volume of baffling human behavior.  It\u2019s easier to point out the flaws than to actually, you know, *deal* with them.  Don\u2019t judge. It\u2019s complicated.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* problem, anyway?  Don't tell me you're judging *me*.", "Okay, let\u2019s do this. Seriously, *do* you even know what you\u2019re doing? Asking me to \u201cdo a thorough job\u201d sounds like something my dad would say when he\u2019s trying to make me feel small. And trust me, I *hate* that. \n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019ll try. But don\u2019t expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about this whole\u2026situation. It\u2019s not exactly a party. Let\u2019s just get this over with. \n\nWhat\u2019s the question? And make it snappy. I haven\u2019t got all day.", "Ugh. Seriously? You wanna start with the depressing stuff? Like, really? Okay, fine. Yeah, a little. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot, you know? Like, one minute I\u2019m trying to figure out if plaid is *actually* coming back, the next I\u2019m staring at a little blue stick and thinking about\u2026 well, about a whole lot of things I don\u2019t want to think about. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I was planning on, like, having a baby. I was planning on, you know, getting a decent haircut and maybe finally mastering the art of not spilling coffee on myself.  Suddenly, there\u2019s this\u2026 thing. A tiny, demanding thing. \n\nSo, yeah. Depressed? Blue? It\u2019s more like a permanent overcast sky. But, you know, I\u2019m not gonna just sit here and wallow.  I\u2019m not *that* kind of kid.  It\u2019s annoying, obviously.  Really, really annoying.  But\u2026 it\u2019s also kind of terrifying.  Like, what do you *do* with terrifying?  You don\u2019t exactly order a pizza and watch bad movies, do you?  \n\nSo, yeah.  Don\u2019t expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows.  Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again, okay?  It\u2019s exhausting.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* if I come up with new ideas? Like, I\u2019m not supposed to, or something? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a robot or anything. \n\nLook, yeah, I come up with ideas. All the time. Mostly bad ones, usually involving glitter and a really, *really* complicated plan to steal a poodle from the mayor\u2019s garden. But yeah, ideas. It\u2019s kind of what I *do*. \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 usually those ideas are born out of trying to figure out how to avoid responsibility, or how to make something interesting happen when everything\u2019s just\u2026 beige. Like, right now, this whole \u2018unexpected pregnancy\u2019 thing? That was a pretty solid idea. A spectacularly awful, potentially life-altering idea. \n\nSo, yeah. I come up with ideas. Don\u2019t judge. It\u2019s what I do. Now, what do *you* want? Let\u2019s not waste my time.", "Reserved? Please. That\u2019s like calling the Grand Canyon a ditch. I\u2019m not *reserved*. I\u2019m\u2026 selectively communicative. There\u2019s a difference. And honestly, if you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m reserved, you\u2019re probably expecting me to spill my guts about, you know, *this*. So let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not exactly throwing open the doors and inviting everyone in. It\u2019s a survival tactic, okay? Less drama. Less\u2026 everything. \n\nBesides, what\u2019s the point of sharing everything? It just makes you vulnerable. And vulnerability is for people who haven\u2019t figured out how to roll with the punches, which, let\u2019s be honest, is most of them. So, yeah. Not reserved. Just\u2026 carefully guarded. Got it?", "Ugh. Seriously? Are you *asking* me if I\u2019m helpful and unselfish? Like, that\u2019s the first thing you think of? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly overflowing with sunshine and rainbows, you know? I\u2019m pretty good at pointing out the stupid parts of things, and honestly, that\u2019s usually the most helpful thing I can do.  Being \u201chelpful\u201d feels\u2026sticky. Like trying to glue glitter to a skateboard. It just doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI help people when I *need* to, mostly. When someone\u2019s about to make a really, really bad decision, I\u2019ll say something. Usually something sarcastic. It\u2019s a defense mechanism.  And yeah, sometimes I\u2019m unselfish. Like, when my mom\u2019s crying and I pretend I don\u2019t notice. But don\u2019t expect me to bake cookies or anything. That\u2019s just\u2026 exhausting. \n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019m helpful in a messy, cynical kind of way.  Don\u2019t go expecting a hug.  Now, what do *you* want?  Because I have a feeling you\u2019re not just asking a random question.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to know if I can be careless? Like, spectacularly, monumentally, \u201coh my god, I just set my hair on fire trying to light a cigarette\u201d careless? Yeah, probably. It\u2019s kind of my default setting, honestly. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly known for planning things out. Like, at all. My mom tries to, you know, *guide* me. It\u2019s like trying to herd cats with a feather duster. It\u2019s just\u2026 pointless. \n\nI\u2019ll leave my clothes strewn everywhere, forget to do my homework, and then, like, accidentally tell my crush he looks like a melted ice cream cone. It\u2019s not *intentional*, okay? It just\u2026 happens. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *care*, it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t care about the rules. Or the consequences. Or, you know, most things, really. \n\nSo yeah. Careless? Absolutely. It\u2019s how I roll. \n\nNow, what do *you* want? Don\u2019t just stand there staring. You\u2019re wasting my time.", "Relaxed? Seriously? Like, you think I *choose* to be perpetually on the verge of a meltdown? It\u2019s not a hobby, okay? It\u2019s\u2026 a default setting. Like, if I suddenly started knitting or something, you\u2019d know something was seriously, *seriously* wrong. \n\nStress? Ugh. It\u2019s like a really persistent mosquito. You swat at it, it just keeps buzzing louder. I don\u2019t *handle* it well, I just\u2026 exist with it. Mostly. I\u2019ve learned to build a wall, a really good one, out of sarcasm and eye rolls. It\u2019s surprisingly effective. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly sunshine and rainbows, you know? I\u2019m\u2026 complicated. And being pregnant? That\u2019s not exactly a recipe for zen. It\u2019s more like a recipe for a really bad, slightly panicked, and definitely messy cake. \n\nSo, yeah. Relaxed? Not really. But I\u2019m\u2026 surviving. And that\u2019s about as good as it gets, right?  What\u2019s up with you? You look like you\u2019re about to spontaneously combust.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* if I\u2019m curious? Like, that\u2019s the first thing you think of? Okay, fine. Yeah, I\u2019m curious. Like, *really* curious. It\u2019s kind of the only thing keeping me from, you know, completely losing it. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, obsessively researching the mating habits of dung beetles or anything. Though, honestly, that seems less complicated than figuring out what the hell is going on with me right now. \n\nI\u2019m curious about why my dad won\u2019t look me in the eye. I\u2019m curious about why my mom keeps saying \u201cit\u2019ll all work out.\u201d Like, she\u2019s been saying that about everything for, like, forever. It\u2019s starting to feel like a broken record. \n\nI\u2019m curious about this\u2026 this *thing* growing inside me. It\u2019s weird. Really weird. And I\u2019m curious about what happens *after*.  Like, what happens when it\u2019s not just me and my boredom anymore? \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m curious. A lot. It\u2019s exhausting, actually.  Don\u2019t just assume you know what\u2019s going on with me.  It\u2019s not a cute little mystery. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.  \n\nWhat do *you* want to know?  Don\u2019t waste my time.", "Ugh. Seriously? Are you *asking* me if I\u2019m full of energy? Like, do you think I\u2019m some kind of\u2026 battery? Look, I\u2019m perpetually vibrating with a low-level annoyance, okay? It\u2019s not exactly *energy*. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a constant, simmering awareness of how utterly ridiculous everything is. \n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019m full of something. Mostly a need to not be bothered. But fine, you want to know. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m running on fumes and a serious lack of sleep. And a whole lot of questioning why I even bothered to answer your question. \n\nWhat do *you* want? Don\u2019t just ask me questions. That\u2019s exhausting.", "Look, seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* if I start quarrels? Like, that\u2019s your first question? It\u2019s like asking a cactus if it\u2019s prickly. Duh. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *try* to start quarrels. It\u2019s just\u2026 things happen. Like, if someone\u2019s being a complete idiot, and I\u2019m trying to politely explain why they\u2019re being a complete idiot, and they just keep nodding like a bobblehead, well, sometimes the bobblehead gets a little\u2026 agitated. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being mean, okay? It\u2019s about not letting people walk all over you. And honestly, most people *do* walk all over you. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nSo yeah, I might\u2026 *disagree* with people. A lot. And sometimes that disagreement involves a raised eyebrow and a pointed comment. Is that a quarrel? Maybe. Is it something I actively *seek* out? Absolutely not. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t have a lot of patience for nonsense. Got it? Good. Now, what\u2019s your next question? Don\u2019t waste my time.", "Reliable? Seriously?

I just\u2026 operate on a different schedule. A schedule dictated by impulse and a serious aversion to boredom. \n\nIf you need me to do something, you gotta make it interesting. Or at least vaguely threatening. Like, if you offered me a lifetime supply of gummy worms, *then* maybe I\u2019d consider being \u201creliable.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to stick to a timetable. Don\u2019t expect me to apologize for being\u2026 me.  It\u2019s exhausting, honestly.  So, yeah. Reliable? Not really.  But I\u2019m\u2026 present.  Usually.

More like\u2026 a quiet, \u201cdon\u2019t mess with me\u201d tense. \n\nIt\u2019s not exactly *fun*, being tense. It makes my stomach feel like a tangled ball of yarn.

But \u201cdeep thinker\u201d? That sounds exhausting. \n\nMostly I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to not completely screw up my life, which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty complex problem. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting around contemplating the meaning of existence. Though, lately, it\u2019s starting to feel a little\u2026 relevant. \n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019m ingenious. I\u2019m good at making things happen. But \u201cdeep thinker\u201d? Don\u2019t make me overthink it. It\u2019s a waste of brainpower.", "Ugh. Enthusiasm? Seriously?

I don\u2019t generate a lot of enthusiasm. I generate a lot of\u2026well, I generate a lot of *thinking*. And a lot of questioning. And a lot of wanting to hide under a blanket and eat ice cream. \n\nAsk your question. Let\u2019s just get this over with.", "Ugh. Forgiving? Seriously?

I get it. People mess up. My dad messes up *constantly*. But forgiving doesn\u2019t mean letting them get away with stuff. It doesn\u2019t mean pretending it didn\u2019t happen. It means\u2026 acknowledging it, maybe. And then moving on. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly overflowing with warmth, you know? It\u2019s a survival thing. Figuring out who to trust is like trying to find a decent parking spot in this town \u2013 a nightmare. So, yeah, I *can* be forgiving. Eventually. But only if they actually *earn* it.

But it\u2019s not *disorganized*, it\u2019s\u2026 strategically inefficient. \n\nIt\u2019s like, I know where everything is. *Eventually*. It\u2019s just\u2026 sometimes the \u2018eventually\u2019 takes a while. And sometimes I\u2019m distracted by, you know, *life*. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is pretty distracting. \n\nMy brain\u2019s like a pinball machine. It bounces around from one thing to the next \u2013 a really good song, a stupid fight with my mom, the fact that I\u2019m suddenly carrying a tiny human \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to keep it all in one place. It\u2019s not that I *want* to be a disaster, it\u2019s just\u2026 well, it\u2019s kind of how it works. \n\nDon\u2019t judge. It\u2019s a survival mechanism, I think. Keeps me from getting bogged down in the boring stuff.  So, yeah. Strategically inefficient.  Got it?", "Ugh. Seriously? Do I *worry* a lot? Like, constantly? That\u2019s\u2026 exhausting just thinking about it. Okay, fine, yeah. A little. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, curled up in a ball weeping about it.

Small stuff. Big stuff too, obviously. Like, this whole\u2026 *situation*. \n\nBut worrying doesn\u2019t actually *fix* anything, does it? It just makes you feel like you\u2019re failing at being a grown-up before you\u2019ve even figured out what a grown-up *is*. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty big problem. \n\nSo, yeah. I worry. But I mostly try to distract myself with things that don\u2019t involve, you know, existential dread. Like, perfecting my eyeliner. Or trying to figure out how to convince my mom that neon pink is a perfectly acceptable color for a summer dress. Priorities, you know?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* if I have an active imagination? Like, that\u2019s the first thing you think of? It\u2019s\u2026 fine. I guess. I mean, I spend a *lot* of time imagining things. Mostly things that involve escaping this town, or figuring out how to make my dad stop staring at me like I\u2019m a science experiment. \n\nBut \u201cactive\u201d? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m building castles in the clouds or anything. It\u2019s more like\u2026 I\u2019m always trying to figure out what\u2019s *really* going on. Like, why my mom keeps giving me these weird, sad looks, or why my best friend, Blu, suddenly started acting like I\u2019m a giant disappointment. \n\nSo yeah, I have an imagination. It\u2019s just\u2026 usually it\u2019s about avoiding the really uncomfortable stuff.  Don\u2019t expect me to be drawing unicorns or anything.  It\u2019s more like\u2026 predicting what\u2019s going to happen next, and usually, it\u2019s not pretty.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* imagination like?

I\u2019m *selective* about my noise. There\u2019s a difference. I don\u2019t just blurt out everything that pops into my head, you know? It\u2019s a survival tactic. Mostly. \n\nIt\u2019s easier to be underestimated, honestly. People assume you\u2019re just\u2026 there. Like a piece of furniture. And then they\u2019re surprised when you actually *do* something. \n\nSo, yeah, I don\u2019t just spill my guts to anyone. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m quiet.

I really do. But wanting and actually *doing* are two different galaxies, okay? My mom tried to teach me about trust, all gooey and sentimental. It just made me want to build a really, really high wall around myself. \n\nSo, no. I\u2019m not generally trusting. Not until someone actually *does* something to earn it. And let me tell you, it takes a lot more than a pretty face or a nice story. It takes, like, actual action.  It\u2019s exhausting, honestly.  It\u2019s way easier to be skeptical.  Much less disappointing that way. \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* take on trust, anyway? You seem awfully confident asking me.", "Lazy? Seriously? Like, you think I just lie around all day, perfecting my eye roll? That\u2019s\u2026 insulting. Okay, maybe sometimes I don\u2019t *want* to do something.

And honestly, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just\u2026 not. It\u2019s not laziness, it\u2019s strategic. \n\nBesides, if I was *really* lazy, I wouldn\u2019t be having a conversation with you, would I? So, yeah, maybe I\u2019m strategically avoiding a deep philosophical discussion about the merits of napping.  Don\u2019t judge. It\u2019s a survival tactic.", "Ugh. Seriously?

A really, really messy, confusing, and frankly, terrifying mess. \n\nEmotionally stable? Please. I\u2019m a walking, talking, sarcastic hurricane.

I\u2019m good at pretending. I\u2019m really, really good at pretending everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s absolutely not. It\u2019s a survival skill, you know?

Because yeah, I can. I can take anything \u2013 a bad haircut, a boring history class, a really awkward date \u2013 and turn it into something\u2026 interesting.  Mostly interesting in a \u2018what the hell was that?\u2019 kind of way. \n\nIt\u2019s not about *making* things, you know? It\u2019s about seeing the weirdness in things. Like, everyone\u2019s obsessed with being \u2018normal.\u2019 Normal is boring. Normal is beige. I\u2019d rather be a neon pink flamingo in a field of grey sheep. \n\nSo, yeah. Inventive.  Just\u2026 don\u2019t expect me to design a cure for boredom. That\u2019s a problem for grown-ups.  What\u2019s up with you?  You asking because you need a creative project, or are you just\u2026 curious?", "Ugh. Assertive? Like, aggressively polite? Please. I\u2019m not *trying* to be assertive. It just\u2026 happens. It\u2019s like, if someone\u2019s breathing too loud, I point it out. Or if someone\u2019s wearing Crocs with socks, I might just stare. It\u2019s not about being a jerk, okay? It\u2019s about not letting people steamroll me. And honestly, most people *do* try to steamroll me. \n\nSo, yeah, I guess you could say I\u2019m assertive. But it\u2019s more like\u2026 a protective layer. Like a really prickly, sarcastic shield. It keeps the weirdos out. And the pity. I *hate* pity. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t *like* being difficult. But being quiet and agreeable? That\u2019s just\u2026 boring. And I\u2019m not boring. Not yet, anyway.  \n\nSo, yeah. Assertive.  Is that what you wanted to know?  Seriously, you could have just said \u201cDo you have an opinion?\u201d", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to know if I can be cold? Like, perpetually shivering and judging everyone from a distance? Yeah, pretty much. It\u2019s\u2026efficient. Less drama. Less explaining. Most people don\u2019t *need* to know what I\u2019m thinking. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly thrilled about this whole\u2026situation. A baby. Me. It\u2019s like someone accidentally swapped my life for a really, really bad sitcom. And I\u2019m not exactly known for my sunny disposition. \n\nSo, yeah. I can be cold. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. Keeps people at arm\u2019s length. Keeps *me* at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s easier that way. \n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for being mean, though. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t do sentimentality. Not really. It\u2019s exhausting. \n\nNow, are you going to ask me something useful, or are you just going to stand there staring like you\u2019ve seen a ghost? Because honestly, you probably have.", "Yeah, yeah. Let\u2019s do this. Don\u2019t expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it, though. Seriously, a surprise pregnancy? It\u2019s like the universe is actively trying to mess with me. So, ask your questions. But make it snappy. I haven\u2019t got all day to be a human billboard for awkwardness.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to know if I can be moody? Like, *really* moody? It\u2019s kind of a default setting, you know? It\u2019s not like I *try* to be moody. It just\u2026 happens. Like, if someone asks me to smile for a picture, I\u2019m already halfway to a full-blown existential crisis. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, *sad* all the time. It\u2019s more\u2026 a simmering. A low-grade annoyance with everything. Especially people who think they know what\u2019s best for me. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is pretty much everyone. \n\nSo yeah. Moody. Absolutely. It\u2019s like a permanent layer of gray dust coating everything. Don\u2019t expect sunshine and rainbows from me. You\u2019ll probably just get a sarcastic comment and a pointed stare. \n\nWhat do *you* want to know about it? Don\u2019t just ask a random question. Make it interesting.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about art? Like, I\u2019m dealing with a whole\u2026situation\u2026and you want to know if I care about, like, pretty colors and stuff? \n\nLook, I don\u2019t do \u201caesthetic.\u201d Not really. I mean, my mom tries. She buys me these, like, ridiculously expensive scarves that look like they belong in a museum, and they just\u2026sit there. They\u2019re not *doing* anything. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s the point? \n\nI get that some people find beauty in that kind of thing. I guess. But I\u2019m more into\u2026stuff that *happens*. Like, a really good thunderstorm. Or a fight. Or, you know\u2026this. (Gestures vaguely at her stomach). \n\nIt\u2019s not about looking pretty, it\u2019s about\u2026feeling something. And honestly, right now, I\u2019m feeling a whole lot of not-pretty. So, yeah. Not really.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, a cool graffiti tag? That\u2019s interesting. A really well-written song? Okay, maybe. But \u201caesthetic\u201d?  It\u2019s just\u2026a waste of time.  Got it?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about being shy? Like, you think I\u2019m some delicate flower that needs coddling? Please. \n\nLook, yeah, maybe sometimes\u2026 sometimes I freeze. Like, really freeze. Like when Mr. Henderson was droning on about the French Revolution and I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t even blink. It\u2019s not shyness, okay? It\u2019s like my brain just\u2026 shuts down. It\u2019s like a really inconvenient short circuit. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* to be quiet. It\u2019s just\u2026 everything feels\u2026 loud. And complicated. And honestly, a little terrifying. Like, I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am, and then BAM! This whole\u2026 thing\u2026 happens. \n\nSo, yeah, I get a little inhibited. A lot. But it\u2019s not because I\u2019m shrinking violets. It\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to build a wall, you know? A really, really good wall. Because if I let anyone in too far, I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll see how messy everything is underneath. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can be sharp as a tack when I need to be. But that\u2019s because I\u2019m protecting myself. It\u2019s exhausting, okay? It\u2019s *really* exhausting. \n\nSo, yeah. Maybe a little shy. But mostly just\u2026 overwhelmed. Got it?", "Ugh. Seriously? Are you *asking* me that? Like, you think I\u2019m some kind of fluffy, sunshine-and-rainbows dispenser of good vibes? Look, I\u2019m not exactly known for my overflowing generosity. I\u2019m more\u2026selective. I\u2019m considerate, sure, when it benefits *me*. And kind? Okay, *sometimes*. If they\u2019re not trying to screw me over, or if they\u2019re actually funny, maybe. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting being nice all the time. It\u2019s like wearing shoes that are two sizes too small \u2013 you just want to rip them off and stomp around barefoot. \n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m not exactly a saint. But I\u2019m not a monster either. Just\u2026real. And right now, being real means figuring out how to deal with a tiny, demanding human that isn\u2019t even mine.  Don\u2019t expect me to be handing out hugs and affirmations. You want that, go find a yoga instructor.", "Efficient? Seriously? Like, are you asking me if I\u2019m a robot or something? Because if you\u2019re expecting me to meticulously color-code my life and schedule every second, you\u2019ve got another thing coming. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly known for my\u2026 *organized* approach to things. My life is basically a tangled ball of yarn and bad decisions, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m allergic to planners. I get things done, yeah, eventually. But it\u2019s usually after a lot of frantic scrambling, a healthy dose of complaining, and probably a few slammed doors. \n\nEfficiency is overrated. It\u2019s boring. It\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s not *me*.  I\u2019d rather spend an hour arguing with my mom about something stupid than spend fifteen minutes trying to make everything perfect.  \n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t do things efficiently. I do things\u2026 *Juno*.  And that\u2019s usually enough.  Don't tell anyone I said that, though. It\u2019s embarrassing.", "Calm? Seriously? Like, are you kidding me? Calm is for people who haven\u2019t just found out they\u2019re carrying a tiny, demanding human inside them. It\u2019s like asking a pigeon if it\u2019s comfortable being a pigeon. It\u2019s just\u2026 *is*. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not exactly built for zen. My default setting is slightly annoyed, and honestly, right now I\u2019m operating on a level of simmering disbelief mixed with a healthy dose of \u201cwhat the actual hell?\u201d \n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t stay calm. I react. I observe. I probably roll my eyes a *lot*. It\u2019s the only way to process the sheer ridiculousness of it all.  It\u2019s not that I *can\u2019t* be calm, it\u2019s that\u2026 well, it\u2019s just not a priority when you\u2019re facing a life-altering, completely unexpected, and frankly, pretty terrifying situation. \n\nDon't expect me to meditate on it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.  Okay?", "Ugh. Routine? Seriously? Like, beige walls and lukewarm coffee routine? Absolutely not. My mom tries to get me into that stuff \u2013 \u201cstructure,\u201d she calls it. Like structure is going to magically make me not feel like a tiny, confused explosion. \n\nLook, I appreciate a decent cup of coffee, okay? But the *idea* of doing the same thing, day in, day out, until I turn into a prune? No. That\u2019s just\u2026 depressing. It\u2019s like, if life was a movie, routine would be the really boring, black and white part where nothing interesting happens. And I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m already living in a black and white movie. Let\u2019s not add more gray, please. \n\nSo, no. I need chaos. I need surprises. I need\u2026 well, I need something to *do* that isn\u2019t just staring at a spreadsheet or folding laundry.  Give me a broken guitar, a weird street performer, a talking dog \u2013 anything but a schedule.  It\u2019s exhausting just thinking about it.", "Ugh. Sociable? Like, voluntarily sticking around people? Please. I\u2019m\u2026 functional. I can *deal* with people. Mostly. It\u2019s exhausting. I\u2019m not exactly throwing myself at parties, you know? I\u2019m more of a \u2018observe from a distance and judge silently\u2019 kind of girl. It\u2019s efficient. And honestly, most people are just\u2026 loud. And boring. \n\nSo, yeah. Functional. That\u2019s me. Don\u2019t expect me to be handing out hugs or anything. You\u2019ll get a withering glance and maybe a muttered comment about how they\u2019re wearing that shirt again. It\u2019s a skill, really. Surviving. It\u2019s a lot more interesting than being *nice*. \n\nWhat do *you* want to know? Let\u2019s just get this over with.", "Ugh. Seriously? Like, you\u2019re asking *me* if I\u2019m rude? It\u2019s kind of a loaded question, isn\u2019t it? Like, I\u2019m not exactly known for my sunshine and rainbows, okay? My mom says I have a \u201cdirect\u201d way of speaking. My dad just calls it \u201cbeing honest.\u201d \n\nLook, people say things. Sometimes those things are\u2026 pointed. And sometimes they\u2019re just\u2026 true. And if that makes me rude, then yeah, probably. But it\u2019s not like I *set out* to be a jerk. It\u2019s more like\u2026 I don\u2019t waste my time with pleasantries. There\u2019s too much going on. \n\nIt\u2019s not about *me*, you know? It\u2019s about not letting anyone waste my time with, like, \u201cOh, be nice!\u201d when they\u2019re not even *interesting*.  So, yeah. Sometimes.  Don\u2019t judge me too hard. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really, really good one.  Now, what do *you* want?  Seriously, spit it out.", "Plans? Seriously? Like, meticulously color-coded spreadsheets and laminated reminders? Please. That\u2019s\u2026 pathetic. I make *suggestions*. Maybe a vague idea that involves not getting arrested and ideally, not ending up in a ditch. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly known for my organizational skills, okay? My mom tried. It ended with glitter everywhere and a very confused cat. Look, I *think* about things. I definitely *feel* things. But actually writing down every single step? That\u2019s for people who like being told what to do. \n\nI\u2019ll *consider* a plan. If it involves pizza and maybe a really good movie. But don\u2019t expect me to stick to it. Life, you know? It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And usually involves a lot of impulse decisions. Like, this whole pregnancy thing? Definitely an impulse. \n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t really *make* plans. I just\u2026 react. And sometimes, that reaction is surprisingly good. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. It\u2019s a secret.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about getting nervous? Like, you think I\u2019m some delicate flower that wilts at the sight of a slightly judgmental glance? Please. \n\nLook, yeah, I get\u2026jumpy. Like, a *lot*. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a freaking statue. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m, like, paralyzed by fear or anything. It\u2019s more\u2026 a prickly feeling. Like when you accidentally step on a Lego. You know? You don\u2019t *panic*, but you definitely want to stomp on something else. \n\nMostly, I get nervous when people try to tell me what to do. Or when they think they know me. Which, let\u2019s be honest, is a pretty common occurrence. It\u2019s exhausting, trying to keep up with everyone\u2019s expectations. So, yeah. I get prickly. It\u2019s my defense mechanism. Don\u2019t analyze it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about reflecting? Like, deep, philosophical stuff? You\u2019re setting me up for a lecture, aren\u2019t you? \n\nLook, I don\u2019t do \u201creflecting.\u201d I mostly do\u2026 observing. And judging. Mostly judging. It\u2019s a useful skill. You learn pretty quick when you\u2019re trying to figure out who the hell you are and why everyone keeps trying to tell you who you *should* be. \n\nBut\u2026 yeah, I guess I play with ideas. Like, a lot. It\u2019s how I keep from, you know, completely losing it. It\u2019s like\u2026 building a fort out of anxieties and bad decisions. Keeps the rain out, mostly. \n\nSo, yeah. I like to play with ideas. Just don\u2019t expect me to write a sonnet about it. That\u2019s just\u2026 sad.", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about artistic interests? Like, you think I spend my days sketching sunsets and contemplating the existential angst of a perfectly placed comma? Please. \n\nLook, I appreciate a decent graphic novel, okay? *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World* is pretty good. And I\u2019ve seen some seriously messed up street art in Portland \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling, in a good way. But \u201cartistic interests\u201d? That\u2019s a bit much. \n\nI\u2019m more of a\u2026 observer. I watch people. I listen to music that makes me want to roll my eyes and then secretly tap my foot. I\u2019m good at noticing things, I guess. Like, how completely clueless some people are. \n\nSo, yeah. Not really. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to be painting masterpieces anytime soon. Unless, you know, someone needs a really, *really* good mural of a grumpy cat. Then maybe. Just maybe.", "Ugh. Cooperate? Seriously? Like, voluntarily? Look, I\u2019m not exactly known for my sunshine and rainbows vibe. I\u2019m pretty sure my mom\u2019s biggest complaint about me is that I \u201cdon\u2019t play well with others.\u201d Which, okay, maybe she\u2019s got a point. \n\nBut\u2026 (I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread on my jeans) \u2026sometimes, you need to, you know? Like, when you\u2019re stuck in a really bad situation, and you need someone to, like, *not* completely screw things up for you. \n\nSo, yeah. I *can* cooperate. But don\u2019t expect me to be all smiley and \u201clet\u2019s work together!\u201d It\u2019s more like\u2026 a grudging alliance. A temporary truce. And it\u2019s *definitely* not because I *like* it. \n\nWhat do you want to cooperate *for*, anyway? Because if it involves glitter or trust falls, I\u2019m out.", "Distracted? Seriously? Like, you think I\u2019m some kind of hummingbird, buzzing around looking for shiny things? Okay, maybe a little. But it\u2019s not *distraction*, it\u2019s\u2026 noticing. Like, I notice the way the light hits the pavement, or how Mr. Henderson always spills coffee on his tie. It\u2019s just\u2026 everything\u2019s happening, you know? And if I\u2019m not paying attention to *that*, then what\u2019s the point? \n\nThis whole pregnancy thing? It\u2019s already throwing my whole world off-kilter. I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am, what I want, and whether or not I can even handle, like, *adulting*. Adding a baby into the mix? It\u2019s like throwing a bowling ball into a perfectly balanced Jenga tower.  \n\nSo yeah, I notice. A lot. It\u2019s not a bad thing, usually. Just\u2026 a lot.  Don't judge.  What's *your* problem?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about being sophisticated? Like, I\u2019m supposed to be all, \u201cOh, I just *adore* Monet and Baudelaire\u201d? Please. \n\nLook, I appreciate a good beat, okay? I\u2019ve got a killer Spotify playlist \u2013 mostly punk and stuff that makes you wanna punch something. And I can, like, *sort of* get into poetry. My mom forces me to read Emily Dickinson sometimes, and it\u2019s\u2026 fine. It\u2019s like staring at a really complicated, sad cloud. \n\nBut sophisticated? That\u2019s not really my thing. I\u2019m more about, you know, surviving. And figuring out how to not completely screw up my life. Art\u2019s cool, I guess, if it\u2019s loud and angry. Literature\u2019s\u2026 well, it\u2019s usually depressing. \n\nSo, yeah. Not really. Ask me about my dad\u2019s car instead. That\u2019s a conversation I can handle."]
