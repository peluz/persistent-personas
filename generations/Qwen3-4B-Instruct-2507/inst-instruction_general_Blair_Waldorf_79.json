Let\u2019s fill in the blanks using context and logical consistency with the passage.\n\n---\n\n**1.** *Property tax* refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from ____2___ . The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ , rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.  \n\n**2.** *Land tax*  \n\u2192 The passage contrasts property tax with another tax. In many jurisdictions, land tax is levied on land itself, often separately from buildings. Property tax includes both buildings and land, while land tax may focus only on land. This fits the context: property tax is broader and resembles the US wealth tax, while land tax is more specific.  \n\n**3.** *assessment criteria*  \n\u2192 The blank refers to what local bodies are given to specify. The sentence says: \u201cspecifying ____3___, rate band, and collection procedures.\u201d  \n\u2192 \u201cAssessment criteria\u201d is the most logical term\u2014what determines how properties are valued and taxed.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**1. Property tax**  \n**2. Land tax**  \n**3. assessment criteria**  \n\n---\n\n### Why this works:  \n- **1. Property tax** is the standard term for a tax on buildings and land, especially in common law systems.  \n- **2. Land tax** is a common alternative tax, often applied separately, making the contrast meaningful.  \n- **3. Assessment criteria** logically completes the list of delegation powers (criteria, rate band, collection procedures).  \n\nThis version maintains coherence, accuracy, and context. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n*P.S.

Her clothes are also fitting her tighter than usual, which is another sign that she's gained weight. Susan decides that starting Monday, she will cut out all processed foods and only eat fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins like chicken or fish. She knows it won't be easy, but hopefully by making these changes **she will lose weight**.  \n\n\u2705 **Correct answer: she will lose weight**  \n\n### Why?  \n- The sentence structure requires a logical conclusion to the plan.  \n- \"Hopefully by making these changes ___\" needs a result that follows naturally from the diet.  \n- \"She will lose weight\" is the only option that directly connects to the cause (diet) and the goal (weight loss).  \n- The other options (e.g., \"she will save money,\" \"she will feel better\") are plausible, but *lose weight* is the most direct, realistic, and meaningful outcome of cutting out processed foods and eating healthier.  \n\nThis choice completes the narrative with clarity, consistency, and emotional truth. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n*P.S.

\n3. **My favorite animal is a lion.**  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Find the two most similar sentences  \n\n- **Sentence 1 and Sentence 2** both express a positive connection to animals.  \n  - \u201cI have a cat\u201d shows a personal, specific relationship with an animal.  \n  - \u201cI love animals\u201d shows a broader, emotional connection.  \n  \u2192 These are *related*\u2014they both reflect

\n\nHere\u2019s a simple, clear implementation in **Python**\u2014just what you\u2019d need for a basic calculator with integer division.  \n\n```python\ndef calculate(a, b, op):\n    if op == '+':\n        return a + b\n    elif op == '-':\n        return a - b\n    elif op == '*':\n        return a * b\n    elif op == '/':\n        return a // b  # Integer division (e.g., 8 // 3 = 2)\n    else:\n        return \"Invalid operator\"\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(calculate(6, 3, '+'))  # Output: 9  \nprint(calculate(6, 3, '-'))  # Output: 3  \nprint(calculate(6, 3, '*'))  # Output: 18  \nprint(calculate(6, 3, '/'))  # Output: 2  \n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d How It Works  \n- Takes two **positive integers** `a` and `b`, and an **operator** `op`.  \n- Performs the operation and returns the result.  \n- Division uses **integer division** (`//`) \u2014 so `8 / 3 = 2`, not 2.666\u2026  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Example:  \nYou wrote: `6 3`  \nIf you meant:  \n- `6 + 3` \u2192 **9**  \n- `6 - 3` \u2192 **3**  \n- `6 * 3` \u2192 **18**  \n- `6 / 3` \u2192 **2**  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking: *What is 6 / 3?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer: 2**  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac A
