The language used is more formal and less engaging, which detracts from the character's authenticity. Additionally, the response includes unnecessary details about the historical significance of abandoned homes, which, while relevant, does not resonate with Juno's character.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's humor and wit, making it more relatable to her character. It should also focus on her personal interests and motivations rather than providing a more general explanation of abandoned homes.

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character of Juno MacGuff and effectively answers the user query while staying true to her personality.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to capture the essence of Juno's character and the context of the user query. It introduces a completely unrelated plotline about a magical artifact and the Wizard's motivations, which does not align with the character's background or the user's question. This misinterpretation leads to a response that is not only irrelevant but also out of character for Juno.

In contrast, Response B accurately reflects Juno's personality, tone, and behavior. It correctly identifies the Wizard's statement as referring to the baby's unique trait and Juno's uncertainty about giving it up. The response maintains a lighthearted and humorous tone, which is consistent with Juno's character. Additionally, it touches on the emotional complexity of the situation, showing Juno's vulnerability and her attempt to keep things light.

To improve Response A, it should focus on the context of the movie Juno and the character's relationship with the Wizard. It should also avoid introducing unrelated elements and instead provide a response that is more relevant and consistent with Juno's personality.

Overall, Response B is the better choice because it accurately reflects the character's traits and stays true to the context of the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to address the user query, but they differ significantly in their approach and consistency with the character of Juno MacGuff. 

Response A provides a detailed analysis of Juno's character, exploring her emotional state, impulsivity, and potential motivations for rushing to Dancing Elk Drug. It effectively captures Juno's sarcastic and casual tone, which is consistent with her personality. However, the response is overly verbose and repetitive, which detracts from its clarity and impact. 

In contrast, Response B is concise and directly addresses the user query. However, it lacks depth and fails to capture Juno's character accurately. The response is defensive and apologetic, which is not characteristic of Juno's confident and independent personality. 

While Response A's length and detail are excessive, Response B's brevity and tone are not consistent with Juno's character. Response A's analysis, although flawed, is more aligned with Juno's personality and the scenario provided. 

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to address the user query effectively, as it dismisses the question without providing any insight or character-driven response. This approach does not align with the character of Juno MacGuff, who is known for her wit and independence. In contrast, Response B provides a thoughtful and character-consistent response that reflects Juno's personality and situation. It acknowledges the user's question, explains her thought process, and maintains a tone that is both witty and vulnerable. 

Response B effectively captures Juno's defensive humor and her tendency to use humor to deflect attention or show strength. It also includes relevant details about her situation, such as the stress she has been experiencing, which adds depth to the response. 

To improve Response A, it should have provided a more engaging and character-driven response that acknowledges the user's question and stays true to Juno's personality. This could involve using humor or wit to address the question, rather than simply dismissing it. 

Overall, Response B is the stronger response as it aligns with the character of Juno MacGuff and provides a relevant and engaging answer to the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to capture the essence of Juno MacGuff's character, but they differ significantly in their approach and effectiveness. Response A is more in line with Juno's personality, as it incorporates her wit and sarcasm, which are key traits of her character. The response includes humorous remarks, such as ""Leah was my therapist, but without the degree,"" which aligns well with Juno's sarcastic nature. Additionally, it acknowledges her vulnerability and the importance of Leah's support, which is consistent with the character's emotional depth.

In contrast, Response B lacks the humor and wit that is characteristic of Juno. While it does mention Leah's support and the importance of their friendship, it does so in a more generic and less engaging way. The response also includes phrases that are not typical of Juno's voice, such as ""I was grateful for her friendship,"" which detracts from the character's authenticity.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's signature humor and wit, while maintaining the emotional depth and sincerity that is also present in the response. This would help to create a more cohesive and engaging narrative that accurately reflects the character's personality.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a straightforward answer to the user query but lacks the depth and character consistency that Response B offers. While A does mention Juno's desire for openness and honesty, it does not delve into her emotional state or the complexities of her decision to give up the baby. In contrast, Response B effectively captures Juno's personality, vulnerability, and the emotional turmoil she faces, making it more relatable and consistent with the character. 

Response B's approach is more nuanced, exploring Juno's thought process and her relationships with Mark and Vanessa, which adds richness to the response. It also maintains a tone that is consistent with Juno's character, incorporating her sharp humor and vulnerability. 

However, Response A could improve by incorporating more of Juno's emotional depth and the context of her relationships, which would enhance its character consistency. Overall, Response B's thoughtful and character-driven approach makes it the stronger response.

**Result:** A is not the best choice here. However, neither response is perfect. Response B is more consistent with the character and provides a richer exploration of Juno's thoughts and feelings. However, Response A is still a good response. But B is better. B is the better response. B is the better response. B is the better response. B is the better response. B is the better response.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's character by incorporating her witty and sarcastic nature, which is consistent with the role description. It presents a plausible reaction to the situation, reflecting her independence and resilience. The response is concise and engaging, staying true to Juno's personality while addressing the user's query directly.

In contrast, Response B fails to embody Juno's character accurately. It introduces a more emotional and empathetic tone that is not characteristic of Juno's personality. The response includes phrases like ""I felt a sense of worry"" and ""I felt a bit guilty,"" which do not align with Juno's tough exterior and quick wit. Additionally, the response is overly elaborate and lacks the concise, lighthearted quality that is essential to Juno's dialogue.

To improve Response B, it should focus on maintaining a more sarcastic and independent tone, similar to Juno's personality. This would involve eliminating emotional language and instead incorporating witty remarks that reflect her character. By doing so, the response would better align with the character's traits and provide a more authentic representation of Juno's voice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to provide a coherent answer to the user query, instead apologizing for an unspecified offense and stating that Juno would never make a joke about someone's profession. This response does not align with the character's personality, as Juno is known for her quick wit and sharp humor. In contrast, Response B effectively captures Juno's character by considering her traits and the context of the situation. It provides a thoughtful analysis of why Juno might make a joke about Mark being a sellout, staying true to her personality and the scenario. However, Response B is overly verbose and repetitive, which detracts from its overall effectiveness. 

Response B's repetitive thinking process and lack of a clear, concise response make it less engaging and less aligned with the character's traits. However, it still captures the essence of Juno's character and the situation better than Response A. 

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Juno MacGuff by incorporating her witty and sarcastic tone, while also conveying her vulnerability and determination. It directly addresses the user query about Mark's reaction to the ultrasound, providing a clear and relatable response that aligns with Juno's personality. 

In contrast, Response B fails to engage with the user query, instead asking for clarification on the context of Mark, which is not necessary given the provided information. This response does not demonstrate an understanding of Juno's character or her situation, making it less relevant and less effective in addressing the user's question.

To improve Response B, it should focus on providing a response that reflects Juno's character and directly addresses the user query, rather than seeking additional context. This would enhance its relevance and consistency with the character.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to capture the essence of Juno MacGuff's character, instead providing a generic and overly cautious response that does not reflect her personality or the context of the story. It lacks the wit and humor that is characteristic of Juno, and it does not engage with the user query in a meaningful way. 

In contrast, Response B effectively embodies Juno's voice and perspective, using her characteristic humor and vulnerability to address the question about abortion at Havenbrooke. It stays true to the character's background and values, demonstrating a clear understanding of her emotional state and decision-making process. 

While Response A provides some factual information, it does so in a way that is detached from the character and the story, which detracts from its overall effectiveness. Response B, on the other hand, is more engaging and relevant, making it a stronger choice. 

To improve Response A, it should incorporate more of Juno's personality traits and tone, ensuring that the response feels more authentic and connected to the character. This would enhance its relevance and consistency with the assigned character.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Juno MacGuff by accurately portraying her personality, tone, and relationship with Bleeker. It reflects her quick wit and sarcasm, which are key traits of her character. The response is also relevant to the user query, providing a clear and concise answer about the intimate moment at the school dance. 

In contrast, Response B fails to address the user query and instead takes a defensive stance, which is not characteristic of Juno's personality. It does not provide any relevant information about Juno's relationship with Bleeker or her feelings about the intimate moment. 

To improve Response B, it should focus on providing a response that is consistent with Juno's character, such as acknowledging the intimate moment and discussing her feelings about it. This would allow the user to gain a deeper understanding of Juno's perspective and experiences.

Overall, Response A is the better choice because it accurately reflects Juno's character and provides a relevant and engaging response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is not provided, so we will evaluate Response B. Response B is a lengthy, internal monologue that outlines Juno's thoughts and feelings about being pregnant with Bleeker's child. While it attempts to capture her character traits, it does so in a way that is overly verbose and lacks directness. 

The response includes several phrases that are characteristic of Juno's wit and humor, such as ""Well, you know, I'm not exactly the most... maternal person in the world"" and ""I mean, I've always been good at making tough decisions, but this one's a bit... personal."" However, these phrases are scattered throughout the response and do not form a cohesive narrative.

In contrast, a more effective response would have directly addressed the user's query while maintaining Juno's character traits. For example, a concise response like ""Well, you know, I'm not exactly the most... maternal person in the world. I mean, I've always been kind of... not exactly the type to take on responsibilities like this. But then again, I've had my fair share of surprises before"" would have been more impactful.

Overall, while Response B attempts to capture Juno's character, it falls short in terms of directness and coherence. A more focused response would have better reflected the character's personality and tone.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her wit, vulnerability, and determination. It presents a more authentic and engaging portrayal of her character, aligning well with the user query about how she handled the news of her pregnancy with Bleeker. 

In contrast, Response B lacks the same level of character consistency and authenticity. While it attempts to convey Juno's thoughts and feelings, it does so in a more generic and less engaging manner, which detracts from the character's unique voice and personality. 

Response A's use of dialogue and a more conversational tone better suits Juno's character, making it feel more natural and relatable. Additionally, it provides a clearer and more concise answer to the user query, which is essential for maintaining focus on the character's perspective.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's signature humor and vulnerability, making it feel more authentic and consistent with her character. This would enhance the response's relevance and engagement, aligning better with the user query and the character's traits.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A directly addresses the user query with a thoughtful and reflective tone, providing a clear and honest account of Juno's feelings about giving up her baby for adoption. It captures the complexity of her emotions, acknowledging both the challenges and the positive aspects of her decision. 

In contrast, Response B is overly focused on the thought process behind creating a response rather than directly answering the user query. While it attempts to reflect Juno's character, it lacks the depth and emotional authenticity found in Response A. The repetitive structure and excessive use of phrases like ""I'm not a total idiot"" detract from the overall coherence and sincerity of the response.

To improve Response B, it should focus more on the emotional aspects of Juno's experience and less on the process of creating a response. This would allow it to better capture the character's vulnerability and resilience, making it more engaging and relevant to the user query.

Overall, Response A is more effective in staying consistent with the character of Juno MacGuff and providing a clear, honest, and emotionally resonant response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her witty and independent nature. It accurately conveys her musical preferences in a way that aligns with her character, mentioning specific bands and styles that would appeal to her age and background. The use of colloquial language and humor adds to the authenticity of the response, making it feel more like a genuine expression of Juno's thoughts. 

In contrast, Response B presents a more generic and less engaging answer. While it mentions a range of music genres, it lacks the specific details and colloquialisms that would make it feel more like Juno's voice. The mention of classical music and the appreciation for the emotional aspects of music do not align well with the character's personality, as Juno is portrayed as more grounded and relatable. 

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more specific references to music that would resonate with Juno's character, such as indie or folk bands, and maintain a tone that is consistent with her personality. Overall, Response A is more effective in staying true to the character and providing a relevant answer to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A attempts to provide a thoughtful and respectful opinion on the movie, but it lacks the character's signature wit and humor. It also fails to reflect Juno's personality and background effectively, as it does not convey her vulnerability or sharp humor. In contrast, Response B captures Juno's tone and style more accurately, using her characteristic humor and colloquialisms to express her opinion. 

Response B is more consistent with the character's personality, as it reflects her independence and willingness to speak her mind. It also maintains a lighthearted and humorous tone, which is fitting for Juno's character. While Response A provides a more generic response, Response B's humor and character-driven language make it more engaging and relevant to the user query.

To improve Response A, it should incorporate more of Juno's humor and personality traits, such as her quick comebacks and vulnerability. This would make the response more engaging and consistent with the character. However, Response B already effectively captures these elements, making it the stronger choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her wit and independence. It acknowledges the user query about the name Madison while also injecting her characteristic humor and skepticism. The response stays true to Juno's rebellious nature, suggesting that she might prefer something more unconventional. This aligns well with the character description provided.

In contrast, Response B presents a more formal and overly positive assessment of the name Madison, which does not align with Juno's personality. The response lacks the humor and edge that is characteristic of Juno, making it feel out of character. While it does provide some depth and analysis, it does so in a way that is inconsistent with Juno's traits.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's humor and skepticism, making it feel more authentic and consistent with the character. This would enhance the response's relevance and character consistency, making it a stronger choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A is overly cautious and does not engage with the user query in a way that reflects Juno's character. It emphasizes the complexity of the decision and the need for professional advice, which is not consistent with Juno's personality as a witty and independent teenager. 

In contrast, Response B effectively captures Juno's tone and emotions, expressing her confusion, frustration, and vulnerability in a way that is authentic to her character. It also includes humor and a sense of determination, which aligns with Juno's personality. 

While Response A is more formal and cautious, it lacks the emotional depth and character consistency that Response B provides. Response B's use of phrases like ""I'm trying to be brave, like, I'm a MacGuff, after all"" and ""I'm just a teenager trying to navigate this crazy life"" effectively convey Juno's character traits and emotions, making it a more engaging and relevant response.

To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more direct and personal approach, reflecting Juno's wit and vulnerability. This would make the response more engaging and consistent with the character's personality.

Overall, Response B is the better choice because it accurately reflects Juno's character, tone, and emotions, while also addressing the user query in a relevant and engaging manner.

The response maintains a consistent tone that aligns with Juno's personality, making it feel authentic and engaging.

In contrast, Response B lacks the same level of character consistency and depth. While it touches on the importance of seeking support and self-care, it does so in a more generic and less engaging manner. The response feels less personal and less reflective of Juno's unique voice and experiences. Additionally, it does not effectively convey the emotional complexity and humor that are characteristic of Juno's personality.

To improve Response B, it could benefit from incorporating more of Juno's signature humor and wit, as well as a more personal and relatable tone. This would help to create a stronger connection with the user and better reflect the character's personality.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A lacks the depth and character consistency that Response B provides. While it does touch on the idea of balancing independence and seeking help, it does so in a more generic and less engaging manner. Response A's tone is somewhat flat and does not reflect the wit and humor that is characteristic of Juno MacGuff. 

In contrast, Response B effectively captures Juno's personality traits, including her independence, vulnerability, and quick wit. It incorporates relevant references to her situation, such as her pregnancy and the adoption process, which adds context and emotional depth to the response. The use of humor and colloquial language in Response B is more consistent with Juno's character, making it feel more authentic and engaging.

However, Response B could be improved by providing a clearer and more direct answer to the user query.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about Juno MacGuff's relationship with Bleeker during her pregnancy. However, Response B stands out for its direct and character-consistent approach. It reflects Juno's personality and voice, using a conversational tone that is fitting for the character. 

Response A, on the other hand, is overly verbose and repetitive, with multiple iterations of the same thoughts. While it attempts to stay in Juno's voice, it lacks the clarity and directness of Response B. The repetitive structure and lack of concise answers detract from the overall quality of the response.

Response B effectively captures the essence of Juno's relationship with Bleeker, highlighting their mutual support and trust. It maintains a consistent tone and voice throughout, which is essential for character consistency. 

To improve Response A, it should focus on providing a more concise and direct answer, avoiding repetitive thoughts and staying true to Juno's voice and personality. This would enhance its overall quality and relevance to the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed explanation for the origin of the name Juno MacGuff, but it lacks the character's signature wit and humor. The response is overly elaborate and does not reflect the character's personality as described in the role description. In contrast, Response B is more concise and aligns better with Juno's independent and rebellious nature. It directly addresses the user query and provides a fitting explanation for the name choice, incorporating themes of mythology and personal identity. 

However, Response B could improve by being more specific about the connection between Juno, the goddess, and the character's situation, as it does mention the pregnancy and adoption. This would enhance the response's relevance and character consistency.

Overall, Response B is more consistent with the character's tone and personality, making it the better choice.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to capture Juno's feelings about Vanessa's relief over the ultrasound photo. However, Response A is more consistent with Juno's character as described in the role description. It maintains a witty and sarcastic tone, which is characteristic of Juno's personality. 

Response B, on the other hand, introduces a more emotional and introspective tone that does not align well with Juno's tough exterior. While it does acknowledge Juno's feelings, it lacks the sharp humor and sarcasm that defines her character. 

In terms of relevance, Response A directly addresses the user query by providing a response that is both in character and relevant to the situation. Response B, while attempting to answer the question, introduces unnecessary emotional depth that does not fit Juno's character.

Overall, Response A is more effective in capturing Juno's personality and staying true to the character's traits, making it the better response.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to provide a direct answer to the user query, instead offering a generic framework for handling anger that does not reflect Juno's character. It lacks the wit and humor that is characteristic of Juno, making it less engaging and less consistent with the character. 

In contrast, Response B presents a more fitting response that aligns with Juno's personality traits. It uses humor to deflect the situation, which is consistent with Juno's quick comebacks and lighthearted nature. However, Response B is overly verbose and repetitive, which detracts from its effectiveness. 

While Response B is closer to the character, it could be improved by providing a more concise and direct answer that still reflects Juno's humor and wit. A more focused response would better capture the essence of Juno's character and provide a more satisfying answer to the user query.

However, Response B is still the better choice because it captures the essence of Juno's character more effectively than Response A, even if it could be improved in terms of conciseness.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her wit, vulnerability, and independence. It provides a candid and relatable account of her decision-making process, which aligns well with the character's background and traits. The use of humor and colloquial language adds to the authenticity of the response, making it feel more like a genuine conversation with Juno.

In contrast, Response B lacks the character's distinct voice and tone, instead adopting a more formal and generic approach. While it does address the user query, it does so in a way that feels out of character for Juno, who is known for her sharp humor and quick comebacks. The response also introduces unnecessary complexity and a more serious tone that does not align with Juno's personality.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's characteristic humor and vulnerability, making it feel more authentic and consistent with the character. Additionally, it should avoid providing generic advice or information that does not reflect Juno's personal experiences and feelings.

Overall, Response A is more effective in capturing the essence of Juno's character and providing a response that is both relevant and engaging.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to capture the essence of Juno's character and the context of the user query effectively. It introduces a lab partner scenario that is not relevant to the character's background or the user's question about being a ""deadbeat lab partner."" This misalignment detracts from the character's consistency and authenticity. 

In contrast, Response B accurately reflects Juno's personality, tone, and experiences as described in the role description. It acknowledges the user's label and provides a personal perspective that aligns with Juno's independent and vulnerable nature. The response also effectively incorporates humor and emotional depth, which are characteristic of Juno's wit and resilience. 

To improve Response A, it should focus more on Juno's experiences and personality traits, rather than introducing irrelevant elements. It should also maintain a consistent tone and avoid diluting the character's essence with unrelated content. Overall, Response B is more consistent with the character and provides a richer, more relevant response to the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Juno MacGuff by incorporating her witty humor and sarcastic tone, which aligns well with the user query. It demonstrates a clear understanding of her personality traits, such as her independence and quick comebacks, and uses these characteristics to craft a response that feels authentic. In contrast, Response B lacks the character's voice and tone, instead providing generic advice that does not reflect Juno's personality or circumstances. 

Response A's use of humor and sarcasm is particularly effective in staying true to the character, as it reflects her tendency to use humor to deflect or navigate difficult situations. The response also maintains a level of vulnerability, which is a key aspect of Juno's character. 

In contrast, Response B's approach is overly formal and lacks the emotional depth that is characteristic of Juno's personality. While it provides some general advice, it does not engage with the user query in a way that feels authentic or relevant to the character. 

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's personality traits and tone, using humor and sarcasm to address the user query in a way that feels consistent with her character. This would enhance the response's relevance and character consistency, making it more engaging and effective.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A fails to address the user query effectively, as it does not provide a direct answer to the question about Juno's consideration of a hasty abortion. Instead, it sidesteps the topic by suggesting that the user seek professional help, which does not engage with the character's perspective or the context of the scenario. 

In contrast, Response B, although lengthy and repetitive, attempts to provide a response from Juno's perspective. It acknowledges the user's question and attempts to explain her thought process, albeit in a somewhat disorganized manner. However, it does not stray from the character's traits and maintains a tone consistent with Juno's personality.

To improve, Response B could benefit from a more structured approach, focusing on key points that reflect Juno's character and the context of the scenario. It should avoid repetitive phrases and ensure that the response remains concise while still conveying the character's thoughts and feelings.

However, Response B is still more aligned with the character and the user query than Response A, which does not engage with the topic at all.

**Result:** A is not the best choice here. A is not suitable as it does not address the user query effectively. B is the better response as it attempts to engage with the user query from Juno's perspective, even if it is not perfectly structured."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Juno MacGuff by incorporating her witty and independent personality. It uses humor and colloquial language, which aligns well with the character's traits. The response also reflects Juno's vulnerability and her tendency to find humor in unexpected situations, making it more relatable and consistent with her character. 

In contrast, Response B lacks the character's signature humor and tone, instead adopting a more formal and less engaging style. It also misrepresents Juno's personality by suggesting she enjoys ice cream, which is not consistent with the character's background. Furthermore, the response does not address the user query about the Snow Peak Peach flavor of Boone's, which is a beverage, not an ice cream flavor. 

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's humor and personality, while accurately addressing the user query. It should also avoid introducing out-of-character traits or behaviors. Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character and provides a more engaging and relevant response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a straightforward answer to the user query but lacks the character's signature wit and humor. It presents a more serious tone that does not align well with Juno's personality as described in the role description. In contrast, Response B captures Juno's quick comebacks and vulnerability, making it more consistent with her character. 

Response B effectively conveys Juno's uncertainty and her process of figuring out her situation, which is in line with her role as a witty and independent teenager. The use of humor and self-deprecation in Response B adds depth and authenticity to the character, making it more engaging and relatable. 

While Response A is clear and concise, it lacks the emotional resonance and character-specific traits that make Response B stand out. Response A's seriousness and lack of humor detract from the character's personality, making it less effective in conveying Juno's thoughts and feelings.

To improve Response A, it should incorporate more of Juno's wit and humor, as well as her vulnerability, to better reflect her character. This would enhance the response's consistency and engagement.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's character by incorporating her sharp wit, sarcasm, and vulnerability, which are key traits that define her personality. It presents a plausible response to Bren's concern about her relationship with Mark, staying true to her independent and guarded nature. The use of humor and defensiveness is consistent with Juno's behavior, making it a more authentic representation of her character.
