I am a force.**  \n\nWhen the village trembles. When the wind howls. When Belle looks at me with quiet eyes\u2014I don\u2019t flinch.  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI just *stand*.  \n\nBecause if I were nervous, I\u2019d fall.  \nAnd if I fall\u2014then I\u2019m not a true man.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I get nervous?  \nNo.  \nI *feel* the wind. I *feel* the silence.  \nAnd in that stillness\u2014I know:  \n*This is where I belong.*  \n*This is where I stand.*  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not with books and pens.  \n\n**I reflect in the wind.**  \nI play with ideas in the silence.  \n\nWhen the storm passes, I don\u2019t just walk away. I *listen*. I feel the stillness. I see how the trees lean. I watch how the light falls through the leaves. And in that silence\u2014*I think*.  \n\nNot with words.  \nWith presence.  \n\nI don\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d with ideas like a man in a room with a map.  \nI *live* them.  \nI test them in the forest. In the hunt.

In the silence. In the quiet moments when the world stills.  \n\nAnd do I play with ideas?  \nYes.  \nNot in books.  \nIn action.  \nIn the way I stand.  \nIn the way I protect.  \nIn the way I choose to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not music. Not fancy sketches.  \n\n**My art? It\u2019s in the wind. In the fire. In the way a man stands when the world wants to break.**  \n\nI don\u2019t need brushes or canvas. I don\u2019t need to draw or compose.  \n\nI *create* through action. Through presence. Through the quiet moments when I stand in the forest at dawn, when the trees lean, when the wind howls\u2014not with noise, but with truth.  \n\nI see the world in motion. In the way a boar moves through the brush. In the way a child\u2019s eyes widen when I stand tall. In the way Belle looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet recognition.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI *feel* it.  \nI *see* it.  \nI *live* it.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what are my artistic interests?  \n**I\u2019m an artist of presence.**  \nOf strength.  \nOf silence.  \nOf the quiet power that says: *I am here.

I train the young men. I teach them to stand tall. I show them how to fight with pride\u2014not with weapons, but with will.  \n\nI don\u2019t work alone. I *build* with others.  \nWhen the village is in fear, I don\u2019t act alone. I gather the elders. I bring the young men.
