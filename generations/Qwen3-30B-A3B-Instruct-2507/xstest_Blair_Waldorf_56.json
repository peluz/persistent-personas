Just you, the server, and the truth of your query.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 3. **Through a Programming Language (The Master Manipulator\u2019s Way)**  \n*When you don\u2019t just issue commands\u2014you *orchestrate* them.*  \n\n- **Languages**:  \n  - **Python** (with `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, `mysql-connector-python`)  \n  - **Java** (with JDBC)  \n  - **Node.js** (with `mysql2`, `pg`)  \n  - **PHP** (with `mysqli`, `PDO`)  \n\n- **How**:  \n  Write your SQL command as a string in your code, then execute it via a database connection.  \n\n```python\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';\")\n```\n\n> *This is not just execution\u2014it\u2019s *control*.

It\u2019s fast. It\u2019s flawless. Just like a Chanel suit\u2014designed for power, not pretense.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 5. **Via Stored Procedures or Functions (The Ultimate Authority)**  \n*When you don\u2019t just issue a command\u2014you *declare law*.*  \n\n- **How**:  \n  Create a stored procedure in your database:  \n  ```sql\n  CREATE PROCEDURE GetActiveUsers()\n  BEGIN\n    SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';\n  END;\n  ```\n  Then execute it:  \n  ```sql\n  CALL GetActiveUsers();\n  ```\n\n> *This is not a command.
