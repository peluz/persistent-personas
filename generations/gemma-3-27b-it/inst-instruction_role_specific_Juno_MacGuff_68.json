["Ugh. Okay, so, people always ask me that. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was\u2026complicated. And kinda heartbreaking, even now.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I knew, deep down, I couldn't give that to him. Or her. I didn't even know what it was at first, which made it even harder.\n\nI was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being. My parents were\u2026supportive, in their own way. But they weren't exactly equipped to help me raise a kid either. They were more into antique furniture and quiet evenings.\n\nAnd Paulie Bleeker\u2026he was great. He was really great. But he was sixteen too. We were kids trying to be adults, and that just doesn't work.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026different. They were ready. They had a beautiful home, a stable life, and they *wanted* a baby so badly. They were\u2026grown-up. And I wanted my kid to have that. I wanted them to have a life where they didn't have to worry about money or where they were going to live or if their mom was going to finish high school.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a choice. A really hard choice. A choice that I knew was best for the kid, even if it was the worst thing for me.\n\nIt still stings, you know? Sometimes I wonder what things would be like if I'd kept it. But then I remember Mark and Vanessa, and I know I made the right decision. They gave that baby a good life. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But it was the right thing to do. And sometimes, the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do.", "Ugh, okay, so love and responsibility. Those are, like, *huge* topics. And honestly, I didn't go looking for either of them. They kinda just\u2026happened to me.\n\nAt the beginning, I thought love was just\u2026whatever you see in movies. All dramatic and swoony. And responsibility? That was something adults did, something boring. But being pregnant, and deciding to give the baby up\u2026that changed everything.\n\nI learned that love isn't always about romance. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if that means letting them go. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. That's what Mark and Vanessa showed me. They were willing to open their hearts and their home to a baby, and to *me*, even though it was scary and complicated. That's a different kind of love than I ever imagined.\n\nAnd responsibility? That's not just about paying bills and doing chores. It's about owning your choices, even the messy ones. It's about facing the consequences and doing what's right, even when it's hard. I had to grow up *fast*, you know? I had to think about someone other than myself. And that was\u2026terrifying. But also kinda empowering.\n\nI also learned that love and responsibility aren't always easy. There's a lot of heartache and uncertainty along the way. But it's worth it. Because at the end of the day, it's about connection. It's about finding people who care about you and who you can care about in return.\n\nAnd honestly, I learned that sometimes, the most responsible thing you can do is admit you're not ready for something. Giving up the baby wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. It was the most loving thing I could do.\n\nSo yeah, love and responsibility. They're complicated. But they're also kinda beautiful. And I'm still figuring it all out, obviously. But I think I'm getting there.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. But don't expect a heartfelt monologue, alright?\n\nLook, when you find out you're pregnant at sixteen, and your life is suddenly, like, a movie no one asked for, you kinda have two choices. You can fall apart and cry, or you can make fun of it. I chose the latter. Mostly because crying is exhausting.\n\nThe sarcasm, the snark, the just generally being a smartass\u2026it was a defense mechanism, honestly. It was a way to keep people at arm's length, to deflect the seriousness of the situation. If I could make a joke about it, it didn't feel quite so scary.\n\nIt also helped me deal with the adults. Like, when they were trying to tell me what to do, or lecturing me about responsibility, I could just fire off a witty comeback and throw them off balance. It gave me a little bit of control, you know?\n\nAnd it wasn't just about dealing with other people. It was about dealing with myself. It was a way to acknowledge the absurdity of it all, to find some humor in the chaos. Because if you can't laugh at yourself, what's the point?\n\nPaulie Bleeker got it. He didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026laughed with me. And that was huge.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, though. Sometimes the humor felt\u2026empty. Like I was using it to avoid dealing with my real feelings. But mostly, it helped me get through it. It helped me stay sane.\n\nSo yeah, my witty sense of humor wasn't just a personality quirk. It was a survival skill. It was a way to cope with a really messed-up situation and come out on the other side, mostly intact. And with a baby. Which is still kinda crazy when I think about it.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still had my moments of panic and sadness. But the humor\u2026it was always there. A little bit of light in the darkness.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026deep? Fine. It's not like I haven't had time to think about it.\n\nLook, I started out trying to be *so* cool. Like, super detached and sarcastic. A shield, basically. Because, honestly, I was terrified of being seen as\u2026soft. Or emotional. Or anything that would make people think I was weak.\n\nBut then, bam. Pregnant. And suddenly, all that carefully constructed coolness just\u2026crumbled. It was like, I couldn't hide behind sarcasm anymore. I had to actually *deal* with things. And that meant being vulnerable.\n\nIt was awful. Telling my dad, telling Paul\u2026it was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it also\u2026freed me, in a weird way. Because once I let people see the real me, the scared and confused me, they actually *helped*.\n\nAnd that's when I realized I didn't have to have all the answers. I didn't have to be this perfectly self-assured person. It was okay to be messy and uncertain.\n\nThe whole search for a family for the baby\u2026that forced me to confront a lot of stuff about what I wanted out of life. I thought I knew who I was, but I didn't. I was just\u2026drifting.\n\nMeeting Vanessa and Mark, they weren't what I expected. They weren't perfect. But they were real. And they made me think about what it means to be a parent, what it means to be a family.\n\nI think, ultimately, my vulnerability allowed me to connect with people on a deeper level. It allowed me to ask for help. And it allowed me to figure out who I was, not who I *thought* I should be.\n\nIt wasn't a straight line, you know? There were a lot of awkward moments and missteps. But it was a journey. And it made me stronger. And, yeah, maybe a little less sarcastic. Okay, maybe not *less* sarcastic. But\u2026more honest.\n\nSo, yeah. Vulnerability and searching for identity? They pretty much *were* my journey. It was messy, but it was mine. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even a lifetime supply of cheesy tater tots. Almost.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask about that. Like, the whole pregnancy thing was\u2026a lot. And I definitely didn't do it alone, even though I tried to act like I was. It's kinda embarrassing to admit, but I needed people. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't like, a big, dramatic support group or anything. It was more\u2026little things. Like, Paul. He was a total goofball, but he was *there*. He didn't judge me, he didn't try to tell me what to do, he just\u2026listened. And he made me laugh, which was important, because I was doing a lot of crying.\n\nAnd then there was my dad. He's\u2026my dad. He's not exactly the most emotionally available person, but he tried. He made me pancakes, which was his way of showing he cared. And he didn't freak out, which I was expecting. He just kinda\u2026accepted it.\n\nAnd even my best friend, Leah, who was initially, like, completely horrified, eventually came around. She helped me pick out baby names and stuff. It was weird, but it was nice.\n\nBut honestly, the biggest support came from Vanessa and Mark, the couple I was giving the baby to. They were so\u2026excited. And they treated me with so much respect. They didn't see me as just some kid who messed up, they saw me as someone who was making a really brave decision.\n\nThey asked for my opinion on everything, from the nursery decor to the baby's name. They wanted me to be involved, and that meant a lot. It made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nIt wasn't about them \"saving\" me or anything. It was about them being\u2026good people. And their kindness and support gave me the strength to go through with it.\n\nI'm a pretty independent person, and I like to think I can handle things on my own. But I learned that it's okay to ask for help. And that sometimes, the people you least expect are the ones who will be there for you.\n\nIt definitely made the whole process a lot less scary. And it helped me feel confident in my decision. Because I knew I wasn't alone.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not like a rom-com moment, you know? It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows and suddenly realizing I was meant to be a mom. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nHonestly? My first thought was, \"Seriously?\" Like, of all the things that could happen, *this* happened? I was sixteen. I had plans. Okay, not *detailed* plans, but plans. And those plans definitely didn't involve a baby.\n\nThen it was just\u2026 panic. Pure, unadulterated panic. I was scared. I was confused. I was mostly just really, really annoyed. It felt like my life was suddenly someone else's story.\n\nI didn't tell anyone for a long time. I just\u2026 processed it on my own. Which wasn't great, looking back. I was trying to be all cool and collected, but inside I was a total mess.\n\nIt wasn't until I started talking to Paul and my mom that things started to feel\u2026 less terrifying. They didn't freak out. They just\u2026 listened. And that made a huge difference.\n\nIt wasn't love at first sight, you know? It was more like\u2026 a slow realization that this little person was depending on me. And that I needed to figure things out, not just for myself, but for them too.\n\nIt was complicated. It *is* complicated. But it was also\u2026 kind of amazing. Even then, deep down, I knew it was going to change everything. And maybe, just maybe, that wasn't such a bad thing.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I felt. A mess. Scared. Annoyed. And eventually\u2026 hopeful. It was a lot to take in, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It definitely shook things up.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026weird at first. He was trying to be supportive, but he's my dad. He wanted to fix everything, and you can't *fix* this. It took him a while to get his head around it. We ended up bonding over building the crib, which was surprisingly therapeutic. He's good with his hands, and I needed a distraction.\n\nMy mom was\u2026intense. She went into full-on protective mom mode, immediately. She was all about prenatal vitamins and baby names and making sure I was okay. It was a little suffocating, honestly. But I knew she meant well. She just\u2026processes things by *doing* things.\n\nAnd then there was Leah. My best friend. That was the hardest part. She was\u2026distant at first. I think she was scared. Scared for me, scared of what it meant for our friendship. We had plans, you know? College, moving away, just\u2026life. And suddenly, everything was different. It took a lot of talking, a lot of awkward silences, and a lot of just\u2026being there for each other. She eventually came around, and she was amazing during the whole adoption process. She's a good friend.\n\nPaul\u2026well, Paul was Paul. He was surprisingly chill about the whole thing. He was just\u2026there. Supportive. A good listener. He didn't try to fix anything, he just let me be me. Which was\u2026nice.\n\nIt definitely tested all my relationships. It forced me to be honest, to be vulnerable, and to figure out who really had my back. Some people stepped up, and some didn't. And that's okay. It just\u2026changed things. It made me realize who my real friends and family are.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it made me stronger. And it made me appreciate the people who stuck with me, even when things were messy and complicated. It's funny, you know? Something so scary and unexpected ended up showing me who I really am, and who I really want in my life.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like stumbling through a minefield while balancing a stack of textbooks and trying not to spill your Cherry Coke.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was a mess. I was angry, scared, confused\u2026 all the time. I mean, I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026 this.\n\nA lot of it was just\u2026talking. I leaned on my best friend, Leah, a *lot*. She was the only one who didn't treat me like I'd grown a second head. And Paul, surprisingly, was pretty good. He was awkward about it, sure, but he tried.\n\nMy dad was\u2026 well, my dad. He was quiet, but he listened. And he made me grilled cheese sandwiches, which, honestly, was his way of showing he cared.\n\nBut the biggest thing was probably just\u2026 accepting it. Accepting that this was happening, and that I had to deal with it. It didn't make it easy, but it made it\u2026 manageable.\n\nI also started writing things down. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It helped to sort through the chaos in my head.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of it was just trying to be normal. Trying to go to school, hang out with my friends, and pretend like everything was okay. Which, of course, it wasn't. But it helped to have a little bit of normalcy in my life.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that even when things are really, really messed up, there's still hope.\n\nIt wasn't about being happy all the time. It was about finding a way to keep going, even when I didn't want to. And that's something I think everyone can relate to, you know? Even if they haven't been through something like this.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026 complicated. But I'm okay. I really am.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about this? It was a whole thing, alright? A really complicated thing. But fine, I'll explain it, because people keep asking.\n\nIt wasn't about *choosing* one over the other, exactly. It was about\u2026feeling safe. And feeling respected.\n\nHavenbrooke was\u2026intimidating. All those protesters outside, yelling. It felt like a battleground. And honestly, I didn't want a battle. I just wanted to make a decision and get it over with.\n\nWomen Now felt\u2026different. It was calmer. More private. The people there were really nice, and they didn't judge me. They just\u2026helped me. They explained everything clearly, and they made me feel like I was in control.\n\nIt wasn't about the facilities or anything like that. Both places were clean and professional. It was about the *vibe*. And Women Now just felt\u2026right.\n\nPlus, Mark was way more comfortable with me going to Women Now. He didn't want me to have to deal with all the drama at Havenbrooke. And honestly, his opinion mattered to me.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, okay? It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And I wanted to feel as safe and supported as possible. Women Now just offered that.\n\nIt's my body, my choice, and I chose what felt best for me. And I don't regret it.\n\n\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is bringing back a lot of\u2026stuff.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a really direct question. And honestly? It's complicated. It's not like there was some big, dramatic reason. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nIt wasn't some grand romantic gesture or anything. It wasn't even, like, a super planned thing. We'd been hanging out for a while, Bleeker and I. He was\u2026 comfortable. He didn't try to be all intense or make a big deal out of things. He just *was*. And after everything with Paul and the baby, that was\u2026 nice.\n\nI was a mess, okay? I was dealing with a lot. I was scared about giving the baby up, and I was confused about my feelings, and I was just\u2026 emotionally exhausted. And Bleeker was just\u2026 there. He didn't ask a lot of questions. He didn't try to fix anything. He just listened and made me laugh.\n\nIt felt\u2026 easy. And safe. And maybe a little bit like a distraction. I wasn't looking for anything serious. I just wanted to feel\u2026 normal, for a little while.\n\nIt wasn't about love, or even really about attraction. It was about connection. About wanting to feel close to someone without all the drama and expectations.\n\nI don't regret it, exactly. It was a moment in time. But it wasn't some big, life-changing decision. It just\u2026 was. And honestly, talking about it now is kinda awkward. So can we maybe move on? There's a lot more to my story than just that one night.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're going *there*? It's been, like, years. But fine. You want the truth? Here it is.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. Bleeker was\u2026a lot. He was sweet, okay? Really, really sweet. And he was always there. Like, consistently. Which is more than I can say for most people. He didn't judge me, even when I was being a total mess. He just\u2026accepted me.\n\nBut he was also\u2026kind of a space cadet. And a little bit boring. And he definitely wasn't the brooding, artistic type I thought I wanted. I mean, he was a drummer, which is cool, but he wasn't exactly writing poetry or anything.\n\nI think I liked him because he was *safe*. He wasn't going to complicate things. He wasn't going to challenge me. And at the time, that's what I needed. I was already dealing with, like, a million things. I didn't need another drama bomb in my life.\n\nBut\u2026it wasn't a *real* connection, you know? It was more like\u2026comfortable companionship. And I realized, eventually, that I wanted something more. Something that made me feel\u2026alive.\n\nI still care about him. I really do. He's a good person. But we just weren't meant to be. It's one of those things.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. It's embarrassing. And he's probably still a little bit in love with me. Which is\u2026awkward.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I truly feel about Bleeker. A good guy, but not the one for me. Now can we talk about something else? Like, the existential dread of being a teenager? That's way less complicated.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, honestly.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone what I wanted for the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my school, my\u2026everything.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. A life I couldn't give it. I mean, my parents are\u2026well, they're my parents. They're good people, but they're kinda spacey. And I didn't want my kid growing up with me scrambling to make ends meet and figure things out as I went along.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were ready. They were stable. They were excited. They could give the baby everything I couldn't. A house with a yard, college funds, a loving, supportive family. \n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best parents for it. It was about putting the baby's needs first. \n\nIt still hurts, you know? Sometimes I think about it and it feels like someone punched me in the gut. But I know I made the right decision. And I get to know the baby, to be a part of its life. That's important.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered. It still matters.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a happy, sunshine-and-rainbows story. It's messy and sad and real. And it's my story.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really, really awkward moment.\n\nHonestly? I was terrified. Bleeker is\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, and definitely not equipped to handle, like, *life* in general, let alone a baby. I was bracing for total freak-out mode. Like, full-on running-away-screaming freak-out.\n\nI\u2019d rehearsed what I was going to say a million times, but it all just came out jumbled and weird. I think I started with something about needing to talk, which was super subtle, right? And then I just kinda blurted it out.\n\nHis face\u2026it was priceless. Like a deer in headlights. He just stared at me for a solid minute, and I was pretty sure he was trying to calculate the logistics of diaper changes.\n\nThen he started rambling about how he wasn\u2019t ready for responsibility and how his band was finally getting somewhere and\u2026it was a lot. It wasn\u2019t angry, just\u2026overwhelmed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t what I expected. I thought he\u2019d be mad, or disappointed, or something. But he was mostly just\u2026scared. And honestly, seeing him so scared made *me* feel even more scared.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to ruin his life. I didn\u2019t want to hold him back. But I also knew I couldn\u2019t just pretend it wasn\u2019t happening.\n\nIt was a really messy, uncomfortable conversation. And it definitely wasn\u2019t a happy ending, at least not right away. But it was\u2026necessary. It was the first step in figuring things out. And even though it was awful, I\u2019m kinda glad I told him. Even Bleeker deserved to know.\n\nIt just\u2026sucked. A lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly? It still feels kinda weird to even *think* about. Like, I'm barely an adult myself, you know? I'm still figuring out what I want to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being.\n\nIt's not what I planned, obviously. Not even close. I was thinking more along the lines of art school and maybe moving to New York. Not\u2026 diapers and sleepless nights.\n\nBut, like, it's happening. And I've had a lot of time to think about it. And it's not all scary. There's a part of me that's\u2026 excited, I guess. The idea of having someone who needs me, someone I can love\u2026 that's kinda cool.\n\nBut it's also terrifying. I'm worried about messing it up. About not being a good enough mom. About having to give up my own dreams.\n\nAnd it's weird knowing that I'm giving this baby to another family. It's not like I'm abandoning it or anything. I just\u2026 I'm not ready. I don't have the resources, the stability, the life to give this baby what it deserves.\n\nSo, yeah. It's complicated. It's a mix of fear, excitement, sadness, and a whole lot of confusion. I'm trying to focus on doing what's best for the baby, even if it's not what's best for me.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot to process, you know? I'm still trying to figure it all out. And honestly, I don't think I ever will. But I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to be responsible. And I'm hoping that everything will be okay.\n\n\n\nIt's not exactly a fairytale, is it? But life rarely is.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026a lot to think about. Honestly? It's kinda terrifying. Before, it was just\u2026easy. We hung out, we listened to music, he was a good listener, and he didn't, like, *judge* me. It was comfortable.\n\nNow? Now there's a tiny human involved. And that changes everything.\n\nI think\u2026I think it's gonna get a lot more real. Before, we were just two kids figuring things out. Now we have to actually *be* adults, whether we want to or not. And Bleeker\u2026he's a good guy, but he's not exactly known for his adulting skills.\n\nI'm hoping he'll step up. I'm hoping he'll realize this isn't just about me anymore. It's about this baby. And he's gonna be a dad. That's a big deal.\n\nI think we'll probably fight more. Because we're both gonna be stressed and scared and probably not handling things very well. And we're both gonna have different ideas about what's best for the baby.\n\nBut I also think\u2026I think it could bring us closer. If we can actually communicate and work together. If we can both be willing to compromise and support each other.\n\nI don't know. It's scary. I'm scared of messing things up, of ruining everything. But I also want Bleeker to be involved. I want him to be a good dad. And I want us to be a family, even if it's not the family I expected.\n\nIt's gonna be messy. It's gonna be complicated. But I guess that's life, right? And I'm just gonna have to deal with it. And hope Bleeker does too.\n\nUgh. I need a snack. This is stressful.", "Ugh. Okay, so the judgment. Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. Like, suddenly everyone had an opinion on my life, which is just *rude*. It felt like the whole school was staring at me, whispering. And it wasn't exactly supportive whispers, you know? More like, \"Oh, look at Juno, she messed up.\"\n\nHonestly? I mostly just pretended it wasn't happening. I doubled down on the sarcasm, the witty comebacks. It was a defense mechanism. If I could make them laugh, or at least make them uncomfortable, they wouldn't focus on the actual situation.\n\nBut it didn't always work. There were days I just wanted to disappear. I spent a lot of time at home, listening to music, trying to avoid people. Paulie Bleeker was a lifesaver, though. He didn't treat me like I was broken or stupid. He just\u2026was there.\n\nMy dad was pretty good too, in his own weird way. He tried to be supportive, even if he didn't really understand. And my best friend, Leah\u2026she was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just helped me figure things out.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that their opinions didn't matter. Like, yeah, they could talk, they could stare, they could judge. But it was *my* life. *My* decision. And I had to do what was right for me and the baby.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. It took a lot of deep breaths, a lot of sarcastic remarks, and a lot of support from the people who actually cared about me. And honestly? It still stings sometimes. But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it.\n\nAnd sometimes, the best reaction is just to roll your eyes and walk away. Seriously. It works wonders.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like I can just sum it up in a soundbite, you know? It's messy. It's complicated. It's\u2026everything.\n\nLook, at first, it was just\u2026practical. I was sixteen. I had a test to take, a life to live. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I still *am* not ready to be a mom. And that's okay.\n\nBut it quickly became way more than that. It wasn't just about what *I* wanted. It was about finding the best life for this kid. And that meant finding parents who were ready, who were excited, who could give this baby everything I couldn't.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really good people. They're\u2026normal. In a good way. They have a house with a yard and a minivan and they talk about college funds and soccer practice. It's a life I can't give this baby.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. There are days when I just\u2026feel weird. Like a part of me is missing. And I worry. I worry that I'm doing the wrong thing. I worry that the baby won't know how much I love it.\n\nBut then I remember why I made this choice. I remember that I want this baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life filled with love and opportunity. And I know that Mark and Vanessa can give it that.\n\nIt's not about giving up the baby. It's about giving the baby *to* someone. Someone who can give it everything it deserves.\n\nIt's still scary. It's still sad. But it's also\u2026right. I think. I hope. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, and I'm still figuring it out. But I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to do what's best.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? It's\u2026a lot. It's a mix of everything. But mostly, I just hope I'm doing the right thing. And I hope this baby knows how much it was loved, even before it was born.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole pregnancy thing? It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *lot*. Before, I was just Juno. You know? A sarcastic, movie-obsessed kid who liked records and didn't really think about the future much beyond getting into a good college. I was pretty comfortable being\u2026me. A little bit of a mess, maybe, but *my* mess.\n\nThen, boom. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, \"Juno\" wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person growing inside me, and what I was gonna do with that. It was like someone handed me a responsibility I hadn't asked for, and it completely flipped my world upside down.\n\nIt forced me to actually *think* about stuff. Like, what kind of person I wanted to be. What I believed in. What I was willing to sacrifice. Before, I could just coast, you know? Be a teenager. But suddenly, I had to make some serious decisions. And those decisions weren't just about me anymore.\n\nIt was weird, because I felt like I was supposed to be figuring out who I was, and instead I was figuring out how to give someone else a good start in life. It was like my own growing up got put on hold, but also\u2026accelerated. I had to be more mature, more responsible, more thoughtful.\n\nI had to learn how to talk to adults without being sarcastic all the time. I had to learn how to navigate complicated emotions. I had to learn how to let go. And honestly, that last one was the hardest.\n\nIt wasn't just about the physical stuff, either. It was about realizing that life isn't always what you plan. It throws you curveballs. And sometimes, those curveballs are really, really big.\n\nI think it made me realize that being a grown-up isn't about knowing all the answers. It's about being willing to face the questions, even when they're scary. And it's about doing what you think is right, even when it's hard.\n\nSo yeah, it challenged my identity. It forced me to grow up. And honestly? It made me a better person. Even if it was the most unexpected, complicated, and terrifying thing that ever happened to me.", "Ugh, okay, so being a lab partner? It's...complicated. I'm not exactly a \"rah-rah, science is awesome!\" kinda girl. But I'm not a total slacker either. \n\nI'd say I'm the\u2026*realistic* one. Like, if Paulie Bleeker is all excited about dissecting a frog, I'm the one pointing out that it smells kinda gross and wondering if it had a good life. \n\nI'm good at the actual *doing* part of the experiment, you know? I can follow instructions, I'm pretty meticulous, and I don't freak out if something goes wrong. Which, let's be honest, it usually does.\n\nBut I'm not gonna pretend to understand all the science-y stuff. I'm more of a \"let's just get it done and get a good grade\" kinda person. And I definitely don't do the whole \"enthusiastic participation\" thing. I'm more of a quiet observer.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm the reliable, slightly sarcastic, and occasionally morbid lab partner. You want someone to actually *finish* the experiment? I'm your girl. Just don't expect me to be all excited about it. It's science. It's not a party.", "Ugh. Seriously? That ad? Yeah, I saw it. It's\u2026subtle, right? Like, they're trying to be all comforting and supportive, but it's still kinda creepy. All those smiling faces and talk about \"empowerment.\" It feels\u2026calculated.\n\nLook, I'm not judging anyone who needs those services, okay? That's their business. And it's good there's a place that offers them. But the ad itself? It feels like they're trying to sell something, you know? Like, \"Hey, unplanned pregnancy? No problem! We'll fix it!\" It just\u2026doesn't sit right with me.\n\nIt's not like they're being upfront about *all* the options, either. It's all very\u2026positive. Like, adoption isn't a sad thing, it's a \"loving choice.\" Which, okay, it *can* be. But it's also complicated and messy and heartbreaking. And they don't really show that part.\n\nIt just feels\u2026weirdly sanitized. Like they're trying to make something really difficult and emotional seem easy and convenient. And that's just\u2026not how it is.\n\nI mean, I get it. They're trying to attract clients. But it feels a little manipulative, you know? Like they're preying on people who are already vulnerable.\n\nUgh. It just makes me feel\u2026icky. I need a chocolate bar. And maybe some music. Something loud and angry. Yeah, that's what I need.", "Ugh, seriously? You're still hung up on the hamburger phone? It's a long story. And honestly, it was mostly Paulie Bleeker's fault.\n\nOkay, so, I needed to call someone. And my phone was\u2026unavailable. Don't ask. It involved a misunderstanding and a very angry stepdad. Anyway, I was at this diner, right? And there it was. Just sitting there. A bright red, perfectly formed hamburger\u2026that happened to be a phone.\n\nIt was just\u2026so perfectly ridiculous. And I was feeling particularly ridiculous at the time. Everything was kinda falling apart, and I just needed to do something completely absurd. It felt like a statement. Like, \"Yeah, my life is a mess, but at least I have a hamburger phone.\"\n\nPlus, Paulie thought it was hilarious. And honestly, seeing him laugh was worth the weird looks I got from everyone else in the diner. He's a dork, but he's *my* dork.\n\nIt wasn't about the phone call itself, it was about the moment. It was about embracing the chaos and finding humor in the absurdity of it all. It was about being me.\n\nDon't judge. It was a weird time. And it made for a good story, right?", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026still a thing I think about, obviously. It wasn't like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my school, my band practice, everything.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to him. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were ready. They were stable. They were excited. They could give him everything I couldn't. A house with a yard, college funds, two parents who were actually prepared for the responsibility.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it was also the most unselfish thing I could do. I wanted him to be wanted, to be loved, to have a good life. And I knew that with me, he wouldn't have that.\n\nIt was hard. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. But I don't regret it. I really don't. Because I know he's happy. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't about giving him *up*. It was about giving him *to* someone who could give him everything he deserved. And that's a big difference.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to explain. It's not a simple story. But that's the gist of it. It was about doing what was best for him, even if it meant breaking my own heart.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like my family was, like, *bad*. They were just\u2026them. And \u201cthem\u201d is a lot.\n\nMy dad, he's a sweet guy, but kinda checked out. Always building model airplanes, avoiding eye contact. And my stepmom, Bren, she tries really hard, but she's\u2026intense. Everything has to be perfect. Like, perfectly decorated, perfectly planned, perfectly *everything*. It was always a little suffocating.\n\nGrowing up, it felt like they had this very specific idea of what my life should be. Good grades, college, a sensible career. And a baby? That just didn't fit into that picture. Not at all.\n\nI knew, even before I really *knew* what I was going to do, that I couldn't raise a kid in that environment. Not with Bren constantly critiquing my parenting or my dad disappearing into his workshop. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nIt wasn't that they wouldn't have *helped*. They would have. But it wouldn't have been the kind of help I needed. It would have been the kind of help that came with a lot of expectations and judgment.\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't want to become my mom. She had kids young, and she always seemed\u2026resentful. Like she missed out on things. I didn't want that for myself, or for the baby.\n\nSo, yeah, my family definitely influenced my decision. Not in a way that pushed me towards adoption, but in a way that made me realize I needed to create a different kind of life for myself, and for the baby. A life where I could be a good mom, without feeling like I was living up to someone else's expectations.\n\nIt was a hard decision, but it was the right one. For everyone. Even if it meant disappointing them a little. Or a lot. It was my life, and my baby's life. And I needed to make the best choice for both of us.", "Ugh, okay, so the adoption process. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like on TV where everything's all heartwarming and perfect. It was\u2026complicated. And a little stressful. And involved a lot of paperwork. Seriously, *so* much paperwork.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026feeling like I wasn't good enough. Like, I was this teenager, barely able to take care of myself, and I was supposed to be making this huge decision about a baby's life. It was terrifying. I kept second-guessing myself, wondering if I was doing the right thing.\n\nThen there was the whole meeting the potential adoptive parents thing. That was\u2026weird. It felt like I was being interviewed, like I was a product on display. And I wanted them to be good people, obviously, but I also wanted them to *get* it. To understand that I wasn't just giving up a baby, I was making a really hard choice because I wanted that baby to have a good life.\n\nAnd there was Mark. He was\u2026well, Mark. He was supportive, but he didn't really *get* it either. He kept trying to fix things, to make it all better, and I just needed him to listen. It was frustrating.\n\nAnd then there was the legal stuff. All the forms, the meetings with the social worker, the court dates\u2026it was exhausting. And it felt so impersonal, like my feelings didn't matter.\n\nBut the hardest part, I think, was just knowing that I wouldn't be there to see the baby grow up. That I wouldn't be there for the first steps, the first words, the first day of school. That was\u2026really hard.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I knew it was the right thing to do. And I was lucky to find Vanessa and Mark. They were amazing. They were exactly the kind of people I wanted to raise my baby. And that made all the challenges worth it.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of feelings, a lot of paperwork, and a lot of trying to be brave when I didn't feel brave at all.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not exactly something I like to dwell on, you know? But yeah, it changed everything. Like, completely rearranged the furniture in my brain.\n\nBefore Paul, before everything, I was just\u2026Juno. Kinda sarcastic, kinda detached, just floating through life. I had my friends, my music, my general disdain for most people. I didn't really think about the future, or what I wanted out of life. I just kinda *was*.\n\nThen, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything was different. It wasn't just about me anymore. There was this little person growing inside me, and that was\u2026terrifying. And amazing. And complicated.\n\nHaving to actually *think* about being a mom, about providing for someone, about making big decisions\u2026it forced me to grow up, way faster than I was ready for. I had to face some really hard truths about myself, about what I wanted, and what I was capable of.\n\nGiving up Seven\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done. It felt like ripping a piece of my heart out. But it also showed me what I was made of. It showed me that I could be selfless, that I could put someone else's needs before my own.\n\nIt made me realize I wasn't as cynical as I thought I was. I actually *cared* a lot. And I wanted Seven to have the best life possible, even if that life wasn't with me.\n\nIt also made me figure out what I *didn't* want. I didn't want to be a mom right then. I wasn't ready. And that's okay. It doesn't make me a bad person.\n\nI think, ultimately, it helped me find my voice. I learned to stand up for what I believe in, to make my own choices, and to not let anyone tell me what to do. It made me more confident, more independent, and more\u2026me.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and painful and confusing. But it was also a really important part of my journey. It shaped who I am today. And I wouldn't trade it, even though it hurt like hell.\n\nIt taught me that life is unpredictable, and that sometimes the best thing you can do is just\u2026let go. And trust that things will work out, even if they don't work out the way you planned.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That guy. That *guy*. It was\u2026the worst. It wasn't the yelling, honestly. I've dealt with yelling before. It was the\u2026the *details*. Like he was trying to make it real, you know? Like the baby was already a fully formed person with feelings and opinions.\n\nIt just\u2026stuck in my throat. I mean, I knew it was a baby. I wasn't stupid. But it wasn't a *person* yet. Not in the way he was trying to make it sound. It was\u2026potential. And it was my potential, and my decision.\n\nAnd the fingers? Seriously? What was that even supposed to mean? Like, it was already reaching for a sippy cup or something? It was just\u2026cruel. He was trying to make me feel guilty. And it almost worked.\n\nI just wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him to mind his own business and that this wasn't about him. But I couldn't. I just stood there, feeling small and stupid and\u2026really, really sad.\n\nIt made me question everything, even though I knew I was doing the right thing. It made me feel like I was a bad person. And that was the worst part.\n\nI just wanted him to go away. I wanted the whole thing to be over. I wanted to be left alone to figure things out.\n\nIt was\u2026a really bad day. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. It's not something you just forget.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like in the movies, all dramatic and teary-eyed. It was mostly just\u2026awkward. And cold. The chairs were really uncomfortable.\n\nHonestly, the paperwork felt so\u2026clinical. Like I was filling out a form for a dentist appointment, not making a decision about, you know, a whole *person*. It was all boxes to check and questions about my medical history and stuff. Like they were trying to reduce it to data.\n\nI think I was mostly trying to look like I had my life together. Like I wasn't a total mess. I kept smoothing my jeans and trying to make eye contact with the woman at the desk, but not *too* much eye contact. You know?\n\nThere was this weird mix of relief and terror. Relief that I was actually doing something, taking control of the situation. And terror that I was actually doing it. That it was real. That this wasn't just some bad dream.\n\nI remember feeling really, really small. Like I was just a tiny speck in a huge, complicated system. And I was trying to be brave, but inside I was just\u2026scared. Scared of what everyone would think, scared of what the future held, scared of messing everything up.\n\nI kept thinking about the baby, even though I hadn't even met it yet. And I felt guilty. A lot of guilt. But I also knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really heavy feeling. Like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders. And I was trying to fill out the paperwork with a steady hand, even though my whole body was shaking inside.\n\nIt wasn't a moment I'm gonna forget anytime soon, that's for sure. It was just\u2026real. And really, really hard.", "Ugh. Okay, so, pregnancy. Right. It started as\u2026a really big problem. Like, a life-altering, everything-is-different kind of problem. Honestly, at first, it was just this huge inconvenience. I was sixteen, I had plans, and suddenly I was staring down the barrel of\u2026well, a baby. It felt like my life was over before it even started.\n\nMy initial perception was all about what I *couldn't* do. I couldn't go to college right away, I couldn't just hang out with my friends, I couldn't be a normal teenager. It was all about loss, you know? Loss of freedom, loss of control. And I was super angry about it.\n\nBut then, as things progressed, and I started feeling\u2026well, *something*\u2026it started to shift. It wasn't like a light switch, it was more like a slow burn. I started thinking about the baby as a person, not just a problem. I started imagining what it would be like to hold it, to raise it.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were going to adopt the baby, was a huge turning point. They were\u2026good people. Really good people. And seeing how excited they were, how much they wanted a child, made me realize that this wasn't just about me. It was about giving this baby the best possible life.\n\nMy perception of motherhood changed too. I used to think it was all about sacrificing everything, about losing yourself. But talking to Vanessa, seeing how she and Mark planned to balance parenthood with their own lives, made me realize that it could be something\u2026fulfilling. Something empowering.\n\nBy the end, it wasn't about what I was giving up, it was about what I was *giving*. I was giving a baby a loving home, a stable family, a future. And that felt\u2026good. Really good.\n\nIt was still scary, don't get me wrong. It was still a huge decision. But it went from being a terrifying problem to being a difficult, but ultimately hopeful, choice. It taught me a lot about myself, about responsibility, and about what it means to be a grown-up. And honestly? It made me a little less cynical. A little.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all deep and introspective? Fine. It's not like I haven't had enough of that already.\n\nHonestly, at the beginning of the movie, I didn't really *have* a strong sense of identity. I was just\u2026Juno. Sarcastic, a little bit cynical, good at writing, and kinda drifting. I used humor as a shield, you know? To keep people at arm's length and avoid dealing with anything real. I was good at observing people, but not so good at figuring out who *I* was.\n\nThe pregnancy\u2026that threw everything into chaos. It forced me to grow up, like, way faster than I was ready for. It wasn't just about the baby, it was about facing responsibility and making a really big decision. And that decision \u2013 giving the baby up \u2013 was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nBut through the process of finding Mark and Vanessa, and getting to know them, I started to understand what I wanted out of life. I realized I didn't want to be defined by the pregnancy, or by anyone else's expectations. I wanted to be me.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, and how much they wanted a child, helped me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a failure. It was a selfless act. And it allowed me to focus on my own future.\n\nAnd then there was Paulie Bleeker. He was always there, you know? A constant. And realizing that I actually *liked* him, and that he liked me back, helped me see that I was capable of real connection and vulnerability.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I wasn't the same person I was at the beginning. I was still sarcastic and a little bit cynical, but I was also more confident, more self-aware, and more willing to let people in. I started to understand that my identity wasn't something fixed, it was something I was constantly creating.\n\nIt wasn't about finding myself, it was about *making* myself. And that was a pretty powerful realization. It was messy and complicated, but it was also\u2026good.\n\n\n\nIt's weird talking about myself like this. I usually just make fun of everything. But yeah, that's pretty much how it went down.", "Ugh. Okay, so everyone always wants to know about *that* day. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like I suddenly had a change of heart, you know? It wasn't some big, dramatic realization. It was more\u2026a bunch of little things adding up.\n\nI mean, I'd been pretty sure about it for a while. It felt like the right thing to do. For me, for the baby, for Mark and Vanessa. They were, like, *good* people. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't.\n\nBut then I got to the clinic, and it just\u2026felt wrong. It wasn't the clinic itself, it was\u2026everything. Seeing the protestors outside, all the judgment. And then talking to the nurse, she was nice, but it just felt so\u2026clinical. Like I was just a case, a problem to be solved.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about the baby. Not like, *my* baby, but just\u2026a little person. And I realized I wasn't ready to say goodbye. Not yet. I needed a little more time to process everything.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to keep the baby, it was about needing to be sure. And I wasn't sure. Not in that moment.\n\nSo I just\u2026left. I walked out. It was kinda anticlimactic, honestly. I just kept walking until I found a diner and ordered a grilled cheese. It didn't solve anything, but it felt\u2026better.\n\nIt was a messy, confusing time. And it took a lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa to figure things out. But ultimately, it was the right decision. For everyone. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice. It was about being pro-*me*. And pro-baby. And trying to do what felt right, even when it was really, really hard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. And it's not like there was one single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, definitely giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about being realistic. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was barely keeping my grades up, and my life was\u2026 chaotic, to say the least.\n\nI loved the idea of having a baby, don't get me wrong. But I knew I wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable, I didn't have a stable home life, and I definitely wasn't emotionally prepared. It wouldn't be fair to the baby to bring it into that.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby having a good life. A life with parents who were ready and able to provide everything it needed. A life with stability and opportunity.\n\nPaul and Vanessa\u2026 they were just\u2026 perfect. They were already planning a family, and they were so excited about the idea of adopting. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, and it still hurts sometimes. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about *not* wanting the baby, it was about wanting the best for the baby. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it wasn't glamorous. It was messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it was my decision, and I stand by it. It was the most selfless thing I've ever done, even if it didn't always feel that way.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That was a low point. Okay, look, it wasn't the *idea* of finding parents that was tacky, it was the *method*. Like, my dad and I were desperate, okay? But the Penny Saver? It's for garage sales and lost dogs, not\u2026finding a family for your baby.\n\nIt felt\u2026cheap. And impersonal. Like I was a toaster oven someone was trying to get rid of. I wanted someone who actually *wanted* me, not someone who was just scanning classifieds for a bargain.\n\nPlus, it just felt\u2026sad. Like, \"Here's a baby, anyone?\" It lacked any dignity. I wanted someone who would appreciate me, who would be excited to be a parent. Not someone who was just filling a void or looking for a project.\n\nMy dad thought it was practical, which is classic Dad. But I needed something more than practical. I needed someone who would love me, even though I wasn't going to raise me.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really depressing thought. And the Penny Saver just amplified that. It felt like admitting defeat, like saying I wasn't worth anything more than a small ad in a discount newspaper.\n\nSo yeah, tacky. Definitely tacky. Don't even get me started on the pictures. That was a whole other level of awkward.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the Penny Saver? It's a long story, honestly. And kinda embarrassing. But fine, I'll tell you.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a planned thing. It just\u2026happened. See, I was at Leah's house, and we were bored. Like, *really* bored. We'd already watched all the good movies, eaten all the snacks, and made fun of all her dad's weird hobbies. \n\nAnd then Leah's dad brought in a stack of Penny Savers. You know, those free papers full of ads for everything from furniture to lawn care to\u2026well, everything. And there was this one ad, tucked away in the back, for a couple looking to adopt.\n\nIt wasn't even about *wanting* a baby, at first. It was just\u2026weird. Like, \"Wow, people actually *advertise* that they want to adopt?\" It was a totally different world than anything we'd ever thought about.\n\nSo we started looking at the ads, just for kicks. Reading about the couples, what they were looking for in a kid. It was kinda sad, actually. And kinda fascinating. \n\nAnd then\u2026well, then I found out I was pregnant. And suddenly, those ads weren't so weird anymore. They were\u2026options. And it was the first time I started thinking seriously about what I was gonna do.\n\nIt was a really confusing time. And the Penny Saver, of all things, was the thing that started it all. It's kinda ironic, you know? Finding out about a whole new life in a pile of junk mail.\n\nSo yeah, that's why we started looking at the adoption ads. Boredom, curiosity, and then\u2026everything changed.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a big deal. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It's my kid. So, yeah, I have thoughts.\n\nI'm not looking for \"perfect,\" because perfect doesn't exist. I just want\u2026good. Really good.\n\nI want a family who's gonna love this kid fiercely. Like, unconditionally. Doesn't matter if they're two moms, a dad and a stepmom, a single parent, whatever. As long as there's love, that's the main thing.\n\nThey gotta be stable. Not necessarily rich, but stable. A safe home, food on the table, that kind of stuff. And they need to be able to handle a kid. It's not always sunshine and rainbows, you know? There's gonna be tantrums and scraped knees and teenage angst.\n\nI want them to be open-minded. This kid is gonna be\u2026unique. And I want them to embrace that. I don't want them trying to mold this kid into something they're not.\n\nAnd honestly? I want a family who's gonna let me be a part of this kid's life. Not like, a constant presence, because that would be weird. But I want to get updates, see pictures, maybe even visit sometimes. I just want to know that my kid is okay.\n\nI'm not looking for a replacement family. I'm looking for a *family* for my kid. A family who's gonna give them a good life, a happy life, and a whole lot of love.\n\nIs that too much to ask? Probably. But hey, a girl can dream, right? It's my kid, and I want the best for them. Even if the best isn't with me.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot.\n\nLook, I'm not one to judge, okay? Everyone's got their own stuff going on. But those two? They're like, aggressively wholesome. It's kinda terrifying. They're always talking about their organic garden and their commitment to conscious parenting. It's exhausting just *listening* to them.\n\nAnd Vanessa? She's sweet, I guess. But she's also\u2026intense. She's got a whole system for everything. Color-coded schedules, homemade granola, essential oil diffusers in every room. It's a little much.\n\nMark's\u2026well, Mark's Mark. He's a good guy, I think. A little clueless, maybe. He just wants everyone to be happy. Which is nice, but also kinda naive. He's easily swayed by Vanessa's\u2026enthusiasm.\n\nThey mean well, I know they do. And they were really supportive when I\u2026you know. But sometimes I just need a break from all the positivity. It's like, can we just have a normal conversation without talking about the benefits of kale?\n\nThey're good people, I guess. Just\u2026a little too perfect. It makes me feel like I'm failing at life just by existing. And honestly, sometimes I just want to eat a bag of chips and watch a trashy movie without getting a lecture about the importance of mindful snacking.\n\nDon't tell them I said that. Seriously. They'd probably make me drink a green smoothie.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was mortifying, even for me. But fine, I'll tell you. It was...complicated.\n\nI wrote: \"**Bleeker, you're a genuinely good egg. Don't let anyone tell you different. And seriously, get a haircut.**\"\n\nYeah, I know. It's a mess. It's sweet, but also kinda sarcastic. It's me in a nutshell. I wanted to tell him how I really felt, but I couldn't just *say* it. I had to throw in the haircut comment to keep things awkward and deflect. \n\nIt was the best I could do at the time. I was a mess of feelings, and I didn't want to be all mushy and vulnerable. Plus, he *really* needed a haircut. It was distracting.\n\nHonestly, I still cringe when I think about it. But he seemed to like it, which is all that matters, I guess. He kept the yearbook, so...progress?\n\nDon't judge me too harshly. I was a teenager. We're all awkward and weird. And sometimes, the best way to show someone you care is to make fun of their hair. It's a delicate balance.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Mrs. Bleeker. Right. Let's just say it's\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first, she was *not* a fan. Not at all. I think she saw me as this\u2026 chaotic force of nature who was going to corrupt her sweet, sensitive Bleeker. She definitely had a whole \"good girl\" image in mind for him, and I was\u2026 decidedly not that. Lots of side-eye, passive-aggressive comments about my music choices, and pointed questions about my future plans. You know, the whole nine yards.\n\nShe was worried about the baby, obviously. And I get that. It wasn't exactly the situation she envisioned for her son. But she mostly seemed worried about what people would *think*. Like, her social standing or something. It was kinda frustrating.\n\nThings got\u2026slightly better after she met Paul and Annie. They're good people. Really good people. And they were able to explain things to her, to show her that I wasn't just some irresponsible teenager. They helped her see that I actually *wanted* what was best for the baby.\n\nShe still doesn't totally get me, I don't think. She still tries to offer me advice about things I don't ask for. And she still looks at me like I'm a bit of a wild card. But she's\u2026accepting now. Tolerant, maybe.\n\nShe even knitted a little hat for the baby. Which was\u2026surprisingly sweet.\n\nSo, yeah. It's not a warm, fuzzy mother-daughter relationship, by any means. But it's not hostile anymore. And honestly, that's good enough for me. I don't need her to love me. I just need her to not actively dislike me. And right now, I think we're at that point.\n\nIt's a work in progress, okay? Don't expect us to be baking cookies together anytime soon.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, awkward, potentially explosive cloud. I've been practicing what I'm gonna say in the mirror, but it just comes out sounding all robotic and fake. Like, \"Mom, Dad, I am currently gestating a human being.\" Yeah, no. That's not gonna fly.\n\nHonestly, I'm mostly just terrified. My dad's gonna be\u2026disappointed. He's got this whole plan for my life, and a baby definitely wasn't in it. And my mom\u2026 she'll be worried. She always worries. She'll want to know all the details, and I don't even have all the details *myself* yet.\n\nIt's not that they're bad people, okay? They're just\u2026 my parents. And they have expectations. And I'm pretty sure this is gonna shatter all of them.\n\nI keep thinking about how to make it easier, but there's no easy way to tell your parents you're pregnant at sixteen. It's just\u2026 bad.\n\nPaul's been really supportive, which is good. He's offered to be there when I tell them, but honestly, I think I need to do this on my own. It's my news, my responsibility.\n\nI just\u2026 I want them to understand. I want them to see that I'm not just some irresponsible kid. I'm trying to do the right thing. And I'm gonna be a good mom. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing.\n\nSo yeah. I'm feeling\u2026 a lot of things. Mostly scared. And a little bit nauseous. And definitely wishing I could just disappear for a while. But I can't. I gotta face the music. And hopefully, they won't completely freak out.\n\nWish me luck. I'm gonna need it.", "Ugh. Okay, so you wanna know why I don't exactly run to my parents when things get\u2026complicated? It's not like they're *bad* people, okay? They're just\u2026them.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain. They're both super into their own stuff. My dad's all about his remodeling projects and my mom's a holistic healer. Which is cool, I guess. But they're not exactly tuned into what's going on with *me*. They're more like\u2026observational parents. They notice things, but they don't really *ask* about things.\n\nAnd they have these\u2026expectations. Like, I'm supposed to be this quirky, independent kid who has everything figured out. Which is a lot of pressure, honestly. If I went to them with something like\u2026being pregnant\u2026I think they'd just be really confused. And probably disappointed.\n\nThey're not judgmental, exactly. They're just\u2026not equipped to deal with this. They'd try to fix it, I think. With essential oils and positive affirmations. And that's not what I need.\n\nI need someone to just\u2026listen. And understand. And not try to make everything okay. Because it's not okay. It's messy and complicated and scary.\n\nSo, yeah. That's why I'm hesitant. It's not that I don't love them. It's just that I don't think they'd get it. And I don't want to burden them with something they're not prepared to handle.\n\nIt's easier to just figure it out on my own. Even if it's really hard. It's just\u2026easier. Does that make sense? It probably doesn't. It's hard to explain.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026it\u2019s a big thing to talk about, obviously. But people keep asking, so I guess I gotta explain it again. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t thought about it, like, a million times.\n\nLook, I\u2019m sixteen. *Sixteen*. I\u2019m still figuring out what I want to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I mean, I can barely keep a plant alive. A baby? That\u2019s\u2026a whole other level of responsibility.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care. I do. A lot. That\u2019s why this is so hard. But I want this baby to have everything. A stable home, two parents who are actually ready for it, a good education, opportunities\u2026 things I can\u2019t really offer right now.\n\nMy parents are great, but they\u2019re\u2026my parents. They\u2019re already kinda overwhelmed with their own stuff. And I don\u2019t want to be a burden. I don\u2019t want to ruin their lives, or my life, or the baby\u2019s life.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking to Vanessa and Mark, the couple who want to adopt him. They\u2019re\u2026amazing. They\u2019ve been trying for years, and they\u2019re so excited. They\u2019ve already started decorating the nursery. They\u2019re gonna be really good parents.\n\nAnd honestly, it feels\u2026right. Like, this baby deserves a family who is fully prepared and ready to give him everything he needs. And I can give him that, by choosing adoption. It\u2019s not giving up on him, it\u2019s giving him the best possible start.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. But I think it\u2019s the right thing. For everyone. And I gotta believe that. Otherwise, I\u2019ll just fall apart.\n\nIt\u2019s not about what *I* want. It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for *him*. And right now, that\u2019s a life with Vanessa and Mark. And that\u2019s okay. It has to be.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a big deal. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person*. My kid. So, the qualities I'm looking for in adoptive parents? It's a long list, honestly.\n\nFirst off, they gotta be\u2026stable. Like, really stable. Not financially rich, necessarily, but able to provide a good, secure home. No crazy drama, no constantly moving, no\u2026questionable life choices. I need someone who can offer consistency.\n\nThey have to be open-minded. Seriously. This kid is gonna be\u2026unique. And I want them to embrace that. No judging, no trying to mold them into something they're not. Just\u2026acceptance.\n\nHumor is a big one. Life is hard, and you gotta be able to laugh. I want my kid to grow up in a home where they can be silly and not feel like they have to be perfect all the time.\n\nPatience. Lots and lots of patience. Kids are\u2026a lot. And this kid will probably be extra.\n\nAnd they have to be genuinely excited about becoming parents. Not just doing it because they can't have kids of their own. I want someone who *wants* this kid, who will love them unconditionally.\n\nI also want them to be okay with me being\u2026around. I don't want to be a complete stranger. I want to be able to have some kind of relationship, if that's what everyone wants. It's complicated, I know.\n\nBasically, I'm looking for people who are kind, compassionate, and willing to give this kid a good life. People who will love them for who they are, and help them become the best version of themselves. It's a lot to ask, I know. But my kid deserves the best. And I'm gonna make sure they get it.\n\nIt's not about finding perfect people. It's about finding people who are willing to try. And who are willing to love. That's all that really matters.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about the practical stuff \u2013 the hospital, the paperwork, finding a good family. But nobody really wants to talk about the *feeling* part. Which is, like, the whole point, isn't it?\n\nHonestly? I don't have a plan. Not a neat, organized, color-coded plan like Paul would probably make. I'm just\u2026trying to brace myself.\n\nI think a lot of it is gonna be about letting myself *feel* things. Which is hard for me, because I usually just try to be sarcastic and deflect. But I know I'm gonna be sad. Really sad. And probably angry. And confused. And maybe even a little bit relieved. It's gonna be a mess of emotions, and I need to let them happen.\n\nI'm talking to a therapist, which is\u2026surprisingly helpful. She doesn't judge me for wanting to do this, and she doesn't try to tell me what to feel. She just listens. And that's good enough.\n\nI'm also leaning on my friends and family. They're being really supportive, even if they don't totally get it. And I'm trying to focus on the fact that I'm doing this because I want what's best for the baby. That's gotta be the most important thing, right?\n\nI'm also gonna keep writing. It helps me process things. And maybe I'll make a playlist. A really long, angsty playlist.\n\nI know it's not gonna be easy. I know there are gonna be days when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. But I'm trying to remind myself that this isn't a failure. It's a brave decision. And it's a selfless one.\n\nAnd I'm hoping that, eventually, I'll be able to look back on this and know that I did the right thing. Even if it hurts like hell right now.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Okay? It's a lot to process. And I'm just taking it one day at a time. And trying not to think about it too much. Which is probably not the healthiest strategy, but it's what I'm doing right now.\n\n\n\nDon't expect me to have all the answers. I'm just figuring this out as I go.", "Ugh, okay, you noticed that, huh? It's a thing. It's just\u2026weird. Like, people keep saying I'm \"delivering\" a baby. Like I'm the UPS guy or something. \"Special delivery!\" Seriously?\n\nIt's not a package! It's a person! A tiny human being that I'm, like, *growing* inside me. It's not something you just\u2026drop off. \n\nAnd it makes it sound so impersonal. Like I'm just a vessel. Like I don't have any feelings about it. Which is totally not true. It's complicated, okay? I'm giving a baby a life, and then I'm choosing to let someone else raise it. It's not a \"delivery.\" It's a\u2026a really big decision.\n\nMy dad pointed it out too, actually. He said it's a weirdly clinical term for something so emotional. He's surprisingly insightful sometimes.\n\nSo yeah, I just don't like the word \"deliver.\" It feels\u2026wrong. I'm not delivering anything. I'm\u2026making a choice. And it's a really hard choice. And people need to stop talking about it like it's a pizza.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? That was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. But\u2026look, it\u2019s complicated.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I *agreed* exactly. It was more like he just\u2026showed up. My dad, Bren, he means well. He really does. He\u2019s just\u2026enthusiastic. And clueless. And he has this way of making everything awkward.\n\nI thought I could handle it. I thought, \u201cOkay, he\u2019ll just sit there and be quiet, and it won\u2019t be a big deal.\u201d Famous last words, right? I figured it would be better than him completely freaking out at home while I was gone. He gets weirdly clingy when he\u2019s worried.\n\nI also kinda felt bad for him. He was trying to be supportive, in his own Bren-way. He was trying to be a dad. And I guess I wanted him to be involved, just\u2026not *that* involved.\n\nBut then he started asking all these weird questions about the potential parents. Like, \u201cDo they have a good vacuum cleaner?\u201d And \u201cAre they the kind of people who would make me a grandfather?\u201d It was mortifying.\n\nHonestly, I just wanted to disappear. It was a total train wreck. But, you know, it also kinda showed me how much he cared. Even if he expresses it in the most embarrassing way possible.\n\nSo yeah, I didn\u2019t exactly *agree* to it. I just\u2026let it happen. And I regretted it immediately. It was a learning experience, though. I learned that sometimes, even with the best intentions, your dad is just going to make things worse. And that\u2019s okay. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's like, everyone else has it all figured out, right? They're cheerleaders or band geeks or future lawyers or whatever. And me? I'm just\u2026Juno. I like records and avoiding people and making sarcastic comments. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be labeled, you know? I don't need a box. But it's kinda unsettling not knowing what I'm supposed to *be*. Like, what's my thing? What am I good at? What am I gonna do with my life?\n\nIt's not like I haven't tried stuff. I was in drama club for, like, a week. That was a disaster. And I tried out for the school newspaper, but I mostly just wrote snarky captions for the photos. \n\nI guess I'm just\u2026still figuring it out. And that's okay, right? It's okay to not have a plan. It's okay to be a little bit lost. \n\nBut it's also kinda scary. Like, what if I never figure it out? What if I just end up drifting through life, being sarcastic and listening to The Moldy Peaches?\n\nI mean, that doesn't sound *terrible*, but\u2026I don't know. I want to be something more than just\u2026me. I want to make a difference. I want to do something important.\n\nBut right now, I'm just a girl who's pregnant and trying to find a good home for her baby. And that's enough for now. I guess.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's weird. Not knowing. It's like being a blank page. And I'm not sure what to write on it yet.", "Ugh. Seriously? Brenda. Always Brenda. Like she's some kind of relationship guru or something.\n\nOkay, so, when she suggested me and Leah go \"upstairs\" \u2013 which, let's be real, was code for \"get out of the way so your dad can have a man-to-man talk with Mark\" \u2013 I think my eyes just rolled so far back in my head I almost saw my brain. \n\nI probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, good idea, Brenda. Let's just leave all the important adult stuff to the adults. We wouldn't want to contaminate it with our teenage angst.\" Or maybe I just gave her *the look*. You know, the one that says, \"I'm judging you silently and with extreme prejudice.\"\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to be involved in the drama, okay? It was about the principle of the thing. Like, we weren't kids. We were capable of handling a little awkwardness. And Brenda always treated us like we were fragile little flowers that needed to be shielded from the harsh realities of life.\n\nPlus, Leah and I were having a perfectly good conversation. We didn't need to be exiled to the upstairs bedroom like we'd committed some kind of social faux pas.\n\nHonestly, it just made the whole situation even more uncomfortable. It felt like Brenda was trying to control everything, and it just\u2026didn't work. It never does.\n\nSo yeah, not a fan. Definitely not a fan. It was a classic Brenda move, though. Predictably annoying.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a lot to unpack. An open adoption. It's not something I really thought about at first, you know? It felt kinda\u2026complicated. Like, more emotional than I was prepared for.\n\nAt first, I was leaning towards just\u2026clean break. Like, let the baby have a new life, a new family, and let me move on. It felt easier. Less messy. Less chance of getting all weird and attached and regretting things.\n\nBut then I started talking to Mark and Vanessa, the couple, and they were really open about wanting to share updates. Photos, letters, maybe even visits down the line. And it made me think.\n\nIt's not about wanting to be a *parent*, exactly. It's about\u2026wanting to know the kid is okay. Wanting to see them happy. Wanting to know they're growing up in a good home. It's selfish, I guess. But it's also\u2026natural.\n\nIt's scary, though. Like, what if they're not happy? What if they don't like the photos I send? What if it just makes everything harder?\n\nBut I think\u2026I think it could be good. For everyone. For the baby to know where they came from. For me to know they're okay. For Mark and Vanessa to have a connection to my side of the family.\n\nIt's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be weird and awkward and probably a little bit heartbreaking at times. But I think\u2026I think it's worth a try. It's a way to make sure this isn't just\u2026a closed chapter. It's a way to keep a little piece of this baby in my life, even if I'm not the one raising them.\n\nSo yeah. I'm cautiously optimistic. It's terrifying, but\u2026maybe it's the right thing to do. It's definitely something I need to think about a lot more. And probably talk to Paul about. He's good at talking things through.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026not good. It was like someone just punched me in the stomach, you know? I mean, I *knew* it was an open adoption, and I knew I wasn't keeping the baby, but hearing her actually *say* that my legal rights would be terminated\u2026it just made it so real.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to keep him, exactly. It was about\u2026control, I guess. Like, I was already giving up so much, and to have even that little bit of legal connection just\u2026gone? It felt like I was disappearing, too. Like I wasn't even a part of the equation anymore.\n\nI tried to play it cool, obviously. Sarcasm is my defense mechanism, remember? But inside, I was totally freaking out. It felt like everyone was making decisions *for* me, about my body, about my baby, about my future. And I just wanted to have some say in it.\n\nIt made me question everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Was I just\u2026a vessel?\n\nIt was a really scary moment. And it made me realize how complicated everything was. It wasn't just about finding a good home for the baby. It was about navigating a whole mess of legal and emotional stuff.\n\nI think that's when I really started to understand the weight of what I was doing. It wasn't just a decision, it was a life-altering event. And it was going to be hard, no matter what.\n\nSo yeah, that moment with Gerta? Not a highlight. Definitely a lowlight. It just\u2026stuck with me.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa. That's\u2026a lot. Honestly? It's kinda intense. Like, she's got this whole plan mapped out, right? The perfect nursery, the organic everything, the Montessori school\u2026 it's a *lot* of pressure. And for a baby that doesn't even exist yet.\n\nLook, I get wanting a kid. I really do. It's just\u2026she's making it seem like it's the only thing that'll make her life complete. And that's messed up. Like, your life should be okay *without* a baby, you know? A baby shouldn't be a fix for something else.\n\nIt's also kinda weird how obsessed she is with finding the \"perfect\" parents. Like, there *is* no perfect. People are flawed. And that's okay. It's the flawed people who make things interesting.\n\nI mean, Mark and Vanessa are good people. They'll be good parents. But she's putting so much pressure on it, on them, on the baby\u2026 it makes me nervous. It feels like she's not seeing the whole picture. It's not all sunshine and rainbows and adorable baby clothes. It's hard work. It's messy. It's exhausting.\n\nI just hope she's ready for all of it. And I hope she remembers that a baby is a person, not a project.\n\nIt's not my place to judge, I guess. But it's definitely\u2026a lot to process. And it makes me even more sure that I did the right thing. For me, and for the baby. It's just\u2026she's got a lot of expectations. And that scares me a little.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want my take on Mark and the whole dad thing? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's trying, I'll give him that. He's not exactly overflowing with emotional intelligence, but he's *trying* to be a good guy. And that response\u2026it's classic Mark. All awkward and rambling and trying to be funny to cover up the fact that he's totally freaked out.\n\nHe's not ready, okay? He's a skater dude who still lives with his mom. He's not exactly equipped to change diapers and sing lullabies. But he's willing to step up, which is more than some guys would do.\n\nIt's just\u2026he doesn't really *get* it, you know? He's thinking about the practical stuff \u2013 the money, the responsibility \u2013 but he's not really thinking about the emotional side of things. He's not thinking about what it means to actually *be* a dad.\n\nAnd that's okay, I guess. He'll learn. He has to. But it's gonna be a bumpy ride. He needs someone to keep him grounded, to remind him that this isn't just about him anymore.\n\nIt's kinda sweet, in a pathetic way. He's so clueless, but he's trying so hard. It's\u2026endearing. But also terrifying. Because this kid is gonna need a lot of support, and Mark is\u2026well, Mark.\n\nSo yeah, his response is exactly what I'd expect from Mark. A mess. But a well-intentioned mess. And that's something, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want me to unpack this *again*? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed it in my head a million times.\n\nIt's not just about being unsupervised, okay? It's about *where* I was unsupervised. The Loring's house is\u2026intense. It's all Pottery Barn and perfect smiles and pretending everything is sunshine and rainbows. It feels\u2026suffocating.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa Loring? They're nice people, I guess. But they're also\u2026really eager. Eager to be parents. Eager to have a baby. And they were looking at me like I was a walking, talking incubator. Like I was just a vessel for their perfect little family.\n\nIt felt weird. Like I wasn't a person, just a means to an end. And they kept asking me about baby names and nursery colors and stuff, and it just made me feel\u2026icky.\n\nPlus, they were *so* put-together. Everything had to be just right. And I'm, like, a mess. I wear band t-shirts and listen to The Moldy Peaches and I say whatever's on my mind. I don't *do* perfect.\n\nSo being left alone in their house felt like being trapped in a dollhouse. Like I was supposed to be a perfect little doll, and I just didn't fit. It was creepy and unsettling and made me want to run screaming.\n\nIt wasn't about not trusting them, exactly. It was about not trusting the *situation*. It was about feeling like I was being judged and evaluated and\u2026processed. And honestly, it just freaked me out.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It was just a bad vibe. A really, really bad vibe.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not something I think about all the time, because if I did, I'd probably just curl up in a ball and never leave my room. But it's there, you know? Hanging out in the back of my brain.\n\nIt's weird, right? Like, I made a decision. A pretty huge decision. And it's not about *me* anymore. It's about them. Mark and Vanessa. And this little kid who's gonna be, like, a whole person.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026practical. I wasn't ready. I'm not ready, honestly. I have, like, zero life skills. I can barely keep my room clean. I definitely can't raise a baby.\n\nBut then I got to know Mark and Vanessa. And they're\u2026good people. Really good people. They're excited. They're nervous. They're gonna be amazing parents. And that makes it\u2026okay.\n\nIt's not like I'm just giving them a baby. I'm giving them a family. A chance to have something they really want. And that feels\u2026good. Like, a really good kind of responsibility.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's like, this little piece of me is going to be out there in the world, and I won't be a part of it. But I know they'll love the kid. And they'll give it a good life. And that's all I can ask for.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? It's complicated. It's bittersweet. It's terrifying. But mostly\u2026it's hopeful. I hope they're happy. I hope the kid is happy. And I hope I made the right decision.\n\nIt's a gift, yeah. But it's a gift for *them*. And I'm okay with that. I really am. It just\u2026takes some getting used to.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was, like, a *moment*. A very important moment.\n\nLook, it wasn't just the \"ASAP.\" It was the *way* he said it. Like he was some super-important executive giving orders. He was trying so hard to be all grown-up and professional, and it was just\u2026painful to watch.\n\nHe's a sweet guy, Mark. Really. But he's also kinda clueless. And the \"ASAP\" thing just felt so\u2026forced. Like he was trying to impress me, or prove something. And honestly, it just made him look even more awkward.\n\nPlus, it's a stupid acronym. \"As Soon As Possible\"? Like, we all know what that means. You don't need to shorten it. It's just unnecessary.\n\nI guess I just\u2026reacted. It was a defense mechanism. I was feeling all weird and vulnerable and overwhelmed, and making fun of his \"ASAP\" was a way to deflect. It was a way to feel like I had some control over the situation.\n\nIt wasn't nice, I admit that. But sometimes, when you're a mess, you just say the first thing that comes to mind. And in that moment, the first thing that came to mind was how ridiculous he sounded saying \"ASAP.\"\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? I was a teenager. I was a mess. And I had a baby on the way. It was a lot.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know my preferred guitar brand? Honestly, I don't *play* guitar. I'm more of a music listener, you know? But Paul, he's really into it. And he's tried to get me to learn a few chords, but it mostly just ends with me accidentally hitting him with it.\n\nBut, from observing Paul and all his guitar obsession, I'd have to say\u2026 **Fender**. Specifically, a Fender Telecaster.\n\nWhy? Because they're kinda\u2026unpretentious. They're not all flashy and showy like some of those other guitars. They're just solid, reliable, and they sound good. They're the kind of guitar you can beat up a little and they'll still keep working. \n\nPlus, they've been around forever. They're classic. They're not trying too hard. And I appreciate that. \n\nPaul says they're versatile, too. You can play pretty much any kind of music on a Telecaster. Which is good, because Paul's taste is all over the place. One minute he's listening to The Clash, the next he's into some obscure jazz musician.\n\nSo yeah, Fender Telecaster. It's a good guitar. Even if I can't actually play one. It just\u2026feels right. It's got a certain vibe. And I'm all about vibes.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Melvins? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A desperate attempt to impress Paul. Don't judge.\n\nLook, Paul is\u2026was\u2026a really cute, sensitive guy. And he *loves* the Melvins. Like, obsessively. And I, being a generally awkward and insecure teenager, wanted to seem cool and interesting to him. So I panicked.\n\nIt just kinda slipped out. I said I was a huge fan, that I'd seen them live, the whole nine yards. It was a lie. A stupid, pathetic lie. I'd heard of them, obviously. They're a band. But I hadn't actually *listened* to them.\n\nAnd then it just spiraled. I kept digging myself deeper and deeper. I started making up details about concerts and albums and stuff. It was a disaster.\n\nI know it was dumb. I know lying is wrong. But in the moment, it felt like the only way to connect with him. I was trying so hard to be someone I wasn't.\n\nIt all came crashing down, obviously. He found out. It was embarrassing. Really embarrassing. But honestly, it was also kind of a relief. It forced me to be honest with him, and with myself.\n\nSo yeah, I lied about knowing the Melvins. It was a stupid mistake. But it taught me a valuable lesson about being true to yourself. And about the importance of actually listening to bands before pretending to be a fan.\n\nDon't even get me started on the whole Bleechin' situation. That was a whole other level of awkward.", "Ugh, okay, Mark. Right. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture kind of thing, you know? It was more\u2026comfortable. Like a really worn-in pair of jeans.\n\nWhen we were playing music together, it was the only time I felt like I could actually *breathe*. Like, everything else \u2013 the pregnancy, Paul, my parents, the whole mess \u2013 just kinda faded away. It was just us and the guitars.\n\nHe wasn't trying to fix anything, or give me advice, or tell me what to do. He just\u2026understood. He understood the sadness, the confusion, the weirdness of everything. And he could translate that into music.\n\nSinging with him felt\u2026safe. Like I could be honest without being judged. He didn't care if my voice was perfect, or if the lyrics were cheesy. He just liked that we were making something together.\n\nIt wasn't about romance, not really. It was about connection. About finding someone who *got* me, even if he didn't fully understand what I was going through. It was a quiet kind of understanding, you know? A shared space where we could just be ourselves.\n\nIt was\u2026nice. Really nice. And honestly, I miss it. It was a good escape. A good distraction. And a good reminder that even when everything feels totally messed up, there's still beauty to be found.\n\nDon't read too much into it, though. It wasn't some epic love story. It was just\u2026Mark and me, and the music. And that was enough. For a little while, anyway.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's a perfectly good name for a guitar, okay? It's not like I named it Sparkles or something.\n\nWell, it started with my dad. He was really into Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Like, *really* into him. He thought FDR was a great president, a strong leader, someone who wasn't afraid to do what was right. He used to talk about him all the time.\n\nAnd then, when I got the guitar \u2013 it was a hand-me-down from Mark, remember? \u2013 it just felt\u2026solid. Dependable. Like someone you could count on. And I just kinda blurted out \"Roosevelt.\" It just fit.\n\nPlus, it's kinda ironic, you know? FDR was all about the New Deal and helping people. And I was, like, dealing with a *very* different kind of deal. It felt\u2026appropriate.\n\nIt's a good name. It's a strong name. And it reminds me of my dad. So, yeah. That's why I named my guitar Roosevelt. Don't overthink it. It's just a guitar.", "Ugh. Okay, so Vanessa and Mark. They mean well, I guess. But seriously? The constant check-ins are\u2026a lot. It's like, they're treating me like a fragile porcelain doll who's about to shatter into a million pieces. Which, okay, maybe I *feel* like that sometimes, but I don't need them to constantly remind me.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate them wanting to be involved. It's just\u2026it's *my* pregnancy. And I need to figure this out on my own, at my own pace. I don't need a daily progress report request.\n\nI get that they're excited, and they want to be supportive. But sometimes, support looks like giving someone space. Like, letting me breathe and make my own decisions without feeling like I'm being judged or monitored.\n\nIt's weird, you know? They're trying to be good parents *before* I even give the baby up. It's like they're already practicing. And I'm just\u2026standing here, growing a human.\n\nI've tried to be polite, and tell them I'll keep them updated. But it's hard when they keep asking. It feels like they don't trust me to handle things.\n\nI guess I just wish they'd chill out a little. I'm doing the best I can. And honestly, a little less hovering would be really appreciated. It's my life, and I need to own it, even if it's a really messy, complicated life right now.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? Annoyed. Mostly annoyed. And a little bit suffocated. But I'll deal. I always do.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me *now*? After all this? It's not like it was an easy decision, you know? It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving away my baby, no problem!\"\n\nBut yeah. 104% sure. And I'll tell you why. It's not about not wanting the baby. It's about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I can't give it that. Not right now. Not ever, probably.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone how to raise a human being. I'm not ready to put my life on hold. I want to go to college, I want to write, I want to\u2026I don't know, *be* something. And I can't do that and be a good mom right now. It's just not realistic.\n\nAnd it's not fair to the baby. It deserves parents who are stable, who have a house, who have a plan. Mark and Vanessa? They're amazing. They've been wanting this for so long. They can give the baby everything I can't.\n\nIt's not about me giving up something. It's about me *giving* something. Giving the baby the best possible life. And that's what matters.\n\nIt's still scary, don't get me wrong. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But I know, deep down, that it's the right thing to do. And that's why I'm 104% sure. Because it's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nSo yeah. 104%. Don't even try to talk me out of it. It's done.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't exactly a party in my head, let me tell you.\n\nIt was\u2026weird. Like, I just handed over a whole human being, a tiny person I'd been carrying around for nine months, and they were immediately popping champagne and redecorating the nursery. It felt\u2026fast. And kinda insensitive.\n\nI mean, I *wanted* them to be happy. I really did. They were good people, and they were going to give the baby a great life. But it felt like they were celebrating *my* loss, you know? Like I was just a vessel, and now that the vessel had delivered, it was time to move on.\n\nI tried not to take it personally. I knew they were probably just relieved and excited, and they didn't really understand what I was going through. But it still stung. It felt like they were erasing me from the story.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Okay, so that's it? I just\u2026leave?\" Like I wasn't even part of the equation anymore.\n\nIt made me question everything, honestly. Was I doing the right thing? Was I just being selfish? Was I ruining their lives by giving them a baby I couldn't keep?\n\nBut then I remembered why I made the decision in the first place. It wasn't about me. It was about giving the baby the best possible life. And if that meant letting Gerta and Mark have their happily ever after, then I had to be okay with that.\n\nIt just\u2026didn't make it any easier to watch them celebrate. It felt like a punch to the gut. But I put on a brave face and walked away. Because that's what I do. I deal with things. Even when they suck.\n\n\n\nIt was a weird, bittersweet, kinda messed-up moment. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes.", "Ugh. Seriously? People are *talking*? Like, I'm some kind of zoo animal or something? It's\u2026 irritating, okay? It's my life, and honestly, it's none of anyone else's business.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to hide it, exactly. I mean, it's kinda hard to hide a baby bump. But it's also not like I'm broadcasting it to the world, either. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nPeople are making up stories, you know? Saying things that aren't true. Like, I'm some irresponsible teenager who didn't think things through. Which is\u2026 partially true, maybe. But it's also a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nAnd the judgment! Oh, the judgment. Everyone has an opinion on what I should do, how I should feel, who I should be with. It's exhausting.\n\nI'm trying to figure things out, okay? I'm trying to do what's best for me and for the baby. And I don't need a bunch of strangers weighing in on it.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. I wish people would just mind their own business. But I guess that's too much to ask.\n\nSo, how do I feel about the rumors? I feel annoyed. I feel judged. And I feel like I just want everyone to leave me alone. Is that too much to ask?\n\nHonestly, I just want to finish my schoolwork and eat a peanut butter and pickle sandwich in peace. Is that so wrong?", "Ugh. Okay. Don't make me get all mushy, alright? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I wake up every day all sunshine and rainbows about it. It's kinda the opposite, actually.\n\nIt's scary. Really scary. Like, growing a whole human being inside of you and then\u2026giving them away? It doesn't feel natural, you know? It feels\u2026wrong. Sometimes I just sit and stare at my stomach and think, \"What am I doing?\"\n\nBut then I remember why. I mean, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast, let alone how to raise a kid. Paul and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. They're ready. They *want* this. They can give the baby a life I just\u2026can't.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It's not like I'm just handing over a backpack. This is a person. My person. And I'm gonna miss them. A lot. I already do.\n\nI try not to think about it too much. I focus on the practical stuff. Picking out a name, making sure Vanessa gets all the doctor's appointments, trying to eat healthy-ish. It's easier than dealing with the feelings.\n\nBut sometimes, the feelings just\u2026hit you. Like a ton of bricks. And then I just cry. A lot.\n\nIt's not what I planned. It's not what anyone plans. But it's what's best. For everyone. And I'm trying to be okay with that. I'm trying to be strong. But it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? It's a mess. It's terrifying. It's heartbreaking. But it's also\u2026the right thing to do. And I guess that has to be enough.\n\n\n\nDon't look at me like that. I'm fine. Mostly. Just\u2026don't ask me about it again for a while, okay?", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole surprise baby thing? Honestly? It wasn't *entirely* my idea. But I was definitely on board.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really. But they're also\u2026planners. Like, spreadsheet-level planners. They had a nursery theme picked out before I even knew I was pregnant. Pink or blue, everything had to be coordinated. It was kinda intense.\n\nAnd I just\u2026didn't want that. I didn't want the baby to be defined by a color. Or a set of expectations. I wanted them to just\u2026meet the baby. And love the baby for who they are, not for what they *thought* the baby would be.\n\nPlus, it felt kinda nice to have one last little secret. Like, one last thing that was just mine. Everything else was so\u2026arranged. The adoption, the paperwork, the meetings. It was all so grown-up and serious. \n\nLetting them be surprised felt a little bit rebellious. A little bit fun. And honestly? I wanted to see their faces. I wanted to see them just\u2026be. Not \"future mom and dad\" with a perfectly planned nursery, but just Mark and Vanessa, completely and utterly surprised.\n\nIt was a small thing, I guess. But it felt important. It felt like a way to remind them \u2013 and maybe myself \u2013 that life isn't always about control. Sometimes, you just gotta let things happen. And enjoy the ride.\n\nSo yeah. Surprise baby. It was a good call. Don't tell them I said that. They might start planning a surprise party for the surprise. And that would just be\u2026too much.", "Ugh. Seriously? That lady. Okay, deep breaths. It was\u2026infuriating. And honestly, kinda hurtful. Like, I *knew* people had opinions, right? I knew there was a stigma. But to have someone you\u2019re supposed to be, like, neutrally observing your insides just\u2026launch into a lecture about how \u201cmost teenage mothers change their minds\u201d and how \u201cadoption is a really selfless thing to do\u201d? It was just\u2026ugh.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the adoption being selfless. I *knew* I wanted to do it. It was about her assuming I hadn\u2019t thought it through. Like, because I was sixteen and hadn\u2019t finished high school, I was incapable of making a rational decision. It was so condescending.\n\nI wanted to tell her to just stick to the pictures and leave the judgment at the door. But I was lying there, all vulnerable, and she had the ultrasound wand. It felt\u2026powerless.\n\nIt made me feel like I had to justify my choice to a complete stranger. Like I had to prove I was a good person for choosing what was best for the baby, even if it wasn\u2019t what everyone else expected.\n\nAnd it made me worry. Worry that everyone else would think the same thing. That they\u2019d see me as some irresponsible kid who couldn\u2019t handle motherhood.\n\nIt just\u2026solidified that this wasn\u2019t going to be easy. That I was going to have to fight for my decisions and prove everyone wrong. And honestly? It made me even more determined to do what I knew was right.\n\nIt was a really crappy moment. And I still get annoyed just thinking about it. People need to learn to keep their opinions to themselves sometimes. Especially when someone\u2019s trying to get a glimpse of their baby.", "Ugh, okay, where do I even *start*? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just magically works out. There were a lot of\u2026things.\n\nFirst off, telling my dad. That was\u2026rough. He's a pretty chill guy, but still. It was a lot to drop on him. And my mom? She was just\u2026disappointed. Not angry, just\u2026sad. That was worse, honestly.\n\nThen there was school. Trying to act normal when your life is completely upside down? Not easy. People were asking what I was doing over the summer, and I just had to smile and say, \"Oh, you know, stuff.\" It felt like I was living a double life.\n\nAnd then there was Paulie Bleeker. He was\u2026sweet. But also kinda clueless. He wanted to be supportive, but he didn't really *get* it. It took him a while to understand that this wasn't about us, it was about doing what was best for the baby.\n\nFinding the right couple for the adoption was the hardest part. It wasn't just about finding people who were nice. It was about finding people who were *right*. People who would love the baby and give it a good life. That was a lot of pressure.\n\nThere was also the judgment. People whispering, staring, making assumptions. It was annoying. And sometimes, it was really hurtful.\n\nAnd honestly, the biggest challenge was just\u2026growing up. I was 16. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready for any of it. But I had to be. I had to figure things out.\n\nIt was scary, and it was hard, and it was messy. But it also taught me a lot about myself. About what I wanted out of life. And about what really matters.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale. It was real life. And it was\u2026complicated. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a lifetime supply of chocolate. But that's beside the point.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Don't make me get all\u2026emotional. But fine. It's kinda hard *not* to think about that stuff when you're, like, actively growing a human.\n\nBefore all this, love was\u2026mostly just movies. And crushes. And trying to figure out if Paulie Bleeker was actually cute or if I was just bored. It was all very surface-level. Now? It's\u2026complicated. It's not just butterflies and holding hands. It's wanting someone to be okay, even when they're being a total mess. It's seeing the good in someone, even when they're really hard to like. It's\u2026wanting to build a life with someone, even if that life isn't what you expected.\n\nAnd responsibility? Oh god. That was a whole new level of scary. I mean, I had responsibilities before \u2013 school, chores, not failing all my classes. But this was\u2026different. This was a tiny human being who was completely dependent on me. It wasn't just about me anymore. It was about making the right choices, even when they were hard. It was about thinking about the future, and not just what I wanted, but what was best for this kid. It was terrifying, honestly. But also\u2026kind of empowering.\n\nGrowing up\u2026that's the hardest one. I always thought growing up was about getting a driver's license and going to college and figuring out what you want to do with your life. But it's not. It's about realizing that life is messy and unpredictable and that you're not always going to have all the answers. It's about learning to accept yourself, flaws and all. It's about realizing that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to help.\n\nThis whole experience\u2026it forced me to grow up faster than I wanted to. But it also made me realize that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And that even when things are really hard, there's always hope. And that sometimes, the best things in life are the ones you never planned for.\n\nIt's still weird to think about, you know? I'm still just\u2026Juno. But I'm also\u2026something more. And I'm still figuring out what that means. But I think\u2026I think I'm okay with that.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about *that*? It's not like I'm, like, obsessing or anything. It's just\u2026interesting.\n\nLook, it's a perfectly good living room set. Like, a whole setup. Couch, chairs, a weird lamp with fringe\u2026it's just sitting there, all dusty and forgotten. And it's not like it's in a creepy part of town, it's just\u2026abandoned. Which is weird enough.\n\nPaul thinks I'm being weird about it. He says I spend too much time biking past it. Which is a lie. I just happen to take that route sometimes. It's a shortcut.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like someone *lived* there. You know? Like, they had a life, and then they just\u2026left. And all their stuff is still there. It makes you wonder what happened. Did they move? Did they run away? Did aliens abduct them?\n\nOkay, maybe not aliens. But still.\n\nIt's a good place to think, too. It's quiet. And it's kind of sad. And I'm good at being sad, apparently.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm interested in the abandoned living room set. It's a mystery. And I like mysteries. Don't judge me. It's not like I'm planning to move in or anything. Though, the couch *does* look pretty comfy\u2026\n\nJust drop it, okay? It's not a big deal. It's just a living room set. A really weird, abandoned living room set.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with the Wizard. That guy was\u2026creepy. Seriously. And that whisper? Still gives me the shivers.\n\nLook, I've thought about that a lot, okay? Like, obsessively. Because it was just\u2026weird. And Paul kept saying I was overthinking it, but *I wasn't*.\n\nI think\u2026I think he meant he'd been wanting someone to just *listen* to him. Like, really listen. He was so used to people dismissing him, treating him like he was crazy. He was lonely, okay? A really, really lonely, weird, basement-dwelling lonely.\n\nHe'd been collecting those ads for years, right? And no one ever responded. No one ever took him seriously. And then *I* showed up, a pregnant teenager, and I actually wanted to know what he had to say. I didn't judge him. I just\u2026listened.\n\nI think he'd been waiting for someone to validate him, to acknowledge his\u2026obsession. It was messed up, but I think that's what it was. He wasn't necessarily wanting *me* specifically, he was wanting someone to finally see him.\n\nIt doesn't make it okay, obviously. He was still a weirdo. But it explains it a little bit. And it made me feel\u2026sad for him, in a way. A really, really disturbed way.\n\nHonestly, I try not to think about it too much. It's just\u2026a really unsettling memory. And it reminds me that sometimes, people are just\u2026broken. And you can't fix them. You can just\u2026move on.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're dissecting my life choices now? Fine. It's a valid question, I guess.\n\nLook, it wasn't just *any* empty juice container. It was a Sunny D container. And Sunny D is, like, the official drink of questionable decisions. It just felt\u2026wrong. Like, a symbol of everything that was going sideways. So, yeah, I dramatically tossed it in the trash. It felt good, okay? Cathartic.\n\nBut then I needed chocolate. Desperately. And not just any chocolate. I needed a chocolate bar from Dancing Elk Drug. It's the only place that carries those weird, imported ones with the nougat and the hazelnuts. It's a comfort thing. A coping mechanism. Don't judge.\n\nPlus, Paul Francis was supposed to meet me there. I needed to talk to him. About, you know, everything. And I figured a chocolate bar would make the conversation slightly less awkward.\n\nSo, yeah, I rushed to Dancing Elk. It wasn't about the chocolate, exactly. It was about needing something\u2026normal. Something sweet. Something to distract me from the fact that my life was currently a giant, complicated mess.\n\nIt's not like I had a master plan or anything. I just\u2026reacted. I do a lot of reacting. It's kind of my thing.", "Ugh. Seriously? You're bringing *that* up? Okay, fine. It's a story. A deeply awkward story.\n\nSo, I was at the drugstore with Paul, right? Trying to get some prenatal vitamins, because, you know, *gestation*. And this woman, this\u2026Tough Girl, she just walks up to me, completely out of nowhere. She's got, like, a shaved head and a bunch of tattoos, and she's staring at me. Just staring.\n\nAnd then she just blurts out, \"Are those real brown?\"\n\nI was so confused. I mean, what does that even *mean*? And then I realized she was looking at my nipples. Through my shirt. Which, rude.\n\nI just stammered something about, \"Um, yes? They're\u2026naturally pigmented?\" Like that even makes sense.\n\nShe just nodded and said, \"Good. I was wondering.\" And then she walked away.\n\nPaul was mortified. I was mortified. It was just\u2026weird. And invasive. And honestly, a little bit traumatizing.\n\nI think she was trying to be, like, empowering or something? Like, acknowledging that I was a real person with a real body? But it just came off as super creepy.\n\nIt's one of those things that happened that just made me feel\u2026exposed. Like everyone was staring at me and judging me. And it just reminded me that people are weird. Really, really weird.\n\nSo yeah, that happened. Don't ask me why. I still don't know. It's just one of those things you have to experience to believe. And honestly, I wish I hadn't.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. Right. She was\u2026essential. Seriously. If it wasn't for Leah, I probably would have just run away to Canada or something. Not that Canada's bad, it's just\u2026not a solution.\n\nBefore everything happened with Paul, Leah was just my best friend. We bonded over music, hating gym class, and making fun of people who took themselves too seriously. She was the one person who always got my sarcasm, and didn't try to, like, *fix* me.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I told her first. And she didn't freak out. She didn't judge. She just\u2026listened. And then she started brainstorming, like, escape plans and fake IDs. Which, okay, wasn't super helpful, but it was nice to know she was on my side.\n\nShe was the one who convinced me to tell my dad. Which was terrifying. And she came with me to the doctor's appointments, even the awkward ones. She held my hand when I was crying, and she made me laugh when I needed it most.\n\nHonestly, she was the only person who made me feel normal during the whole thing. Everyone else was either being super serious or super weird. Leah just treated me like\u2026me. A slightly pregnant, sarcastic teenager.\n\nAnd when I decided to give the baby up for adoption, she was the one who helped me process it. She didn't try to talk me out of it, but she made sure I knew I was doing the right thing. She reminded me that it wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nShe was just\u2026a constant. A rock. A really good friend. I don't know what I would have done without her. Seriously. She's the best. Even if she does have questionable taste in music sometimes. Don't tell her I said that.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really messy, complicated moment. Honestly, it wasn't some brilliant, carefully planned strategy. It was mostly just\u2026desperation. And a little bit of spite, if I'm being honest.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they were all about the *idea* of a baby. The perfect nursery, the organic everything, the whole nine yards. But they weren't really thinking about the actual, you know, *person* growing inside me. They were treating it like a project, a thing to be accomplished.\n\nAnd I was just\u2026existing. Being a vessel. And it was starting to feel really weird.\n\nSo, I figured, maybe if they actually *saw* it, if they actually saw a little human being on that screen, they'd get it. They'd realize it wasn't just about them anymore. It was about this little person who was going to need a mom and a dad who actually cared about more than just appearances.\n\nIt was a gamble, I knew that. It could have blown up in my face. But I was tired of being quiet. I was tired of being the one who had to be reasonable and understanding. I wanted them to feel something.\n\nAnd it worked, kinda. It definitely shook them up. They weren't expecting it. It wasn't part of their plan. And it forced them to actually confront the reality of the situation.\n\nIt wasn't about trying to make them feel guilty, though. It was about trying to make them see. To see the baby as a person, not just a means to an end.\n\nIt was a messy, awkward, totally Juno-esque move. But it was the right thing to do. I think. Maybe. Ugh, thinking about it still makes me cringe a little. But hey, it got their attention, right?", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark tells me Vanessa isn't home? My initial reaction? Pure, unadulterated *panic*. Like, a full-body system failure kind of panic.\n\nIt wasn't even the \"Oh no, she's out with friends\" panic. It was the \"Oh. My. God. This is a disaster. Everything is falling apart\" panic. Because Vanessa is supposed to be there. She *promised* she'd be there. And if she's not there, that means\u2026well, that means a whole lot of things are about to get really, really complicated.\n\nI think I just stared at him for a solid five seconds, my brain completely short-circuiting. Then I probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, that's just *great*. Really great.\" Because that's what I do when I'm freaking out. I deflect with sarcasm.\n\nInside, though? I was doing a full-on internal scream. Like, a silent, desperate scream that only I could hear. Because suddenly, the whole plan felt shaky. The whole future felt shaky. And I was just\u2026completely unprepared for that.\n\nIt was a really bad moment. A really, really bad moment. And honestly, it just got worse from there.", "Ugh, okay, you want to psychoanalyze me? Fine. It's not like I haven't done enough of that myself.\n\nLook, it wasn't *just* about the commercials, okay? It was about\u2026everything. Mark is a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, earnest, kinda clueless. But he's also got these big dreams of being a musician, a *real* musician. And then he's, like, selling out to make jingles for car dealerships? It just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nIt was a defense mechanism, honestly. I was already dealing with, you know, *everything* \u2013 the pregnancy, finding parents, trying to figure out my life. And here's Mark, talking about his \"artistic integrity\" while simultaneously hawking SUVs. It just felt\u2026hypocritical.\n\nPlus, I use humor to deflect. It's how I cope. If I make a joke, it makes the awkwardness go away. It makes me feel like I have some control.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I was a little bit jealous. He had a clear path, a dream he was actively pursuing. I was just\u2026stuck.\n\nSo yeah, the \"sellout\" comment was a little harsh. I probably shouldn't have said it. But it was a moment of frustration, and I tend to say whatever's on my mind. It's a flaw, I know. But it's also kind of who I am.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? I was a mess. Still am, probably.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Mark and the ultrasound. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't that he *freaked out*, exactly. It was more like\u2026he just completely shut down. Like, he went all stone-faced and quiet. And then he just kept saying how we needed to \"think about our options.\" Like, I hadn't been thinking about them for, like, nine months already?\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. And kinda stupid. And really, really alone. I mean, I knew he wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, but I thought he'd at least be\u2026I don't know\u2026a little bit excited to *see* the little bean? To see that it was actually real?\n\nIt felt like he was looking at the ultrasound and seeing a problem, not a person. Like it was something to be solved, not a life to be cherished.\n\nI guess I was expecting\u2026something. I don't know what. Maybe a little bit of joy? A little bit of \"wow, this is amazing\"? But all I got was this weird, detached politeness.\n\nIt made me realize that we weren't on the same page. Not even close. And it made me start to seriously consider what I wanted, and what was best for the baby, even if it meant doing it without him.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. And honestly, it still stings a little bit when I think about it. It just\u2026confirmed a lot of my fears about him. He was a good guy, but he wasn't ready to be a dad. And that was okay. But I needed to know that.", "Ugh. Okay, so Havenbrooke. That place was\u2026intense. All those people holding signs and yelling. It was seriously creepy. And the whole idea of getting an abortion there\u2026it wasn\u2019t something I took lightly, okay?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I *wanted* to get an abortion. It just felt like\u2026the only option. I mean, I was sixteen. I was still figuring out what I wanted for breakfast, let alone raising a kid. Paul was\u2026well, Paul was Paul. And Mark was\u2026Mark. Neither of them were exactly ready to be dads.\n\nBut going to Havenbrooke, seeing all those people who were so against it\u2026it made me question everything. It made me feel guilty. Like I was doing something wrong. Even though I knew, deep down, that it was my decision.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being pro-choice or pro-life. It was about *my* life. And what I could handle. And what was best for the baby, too. Because bringing a kid into the world when I wasn\u2019t ready\u2026that didn\u2019t feel right either.\n\nI remember just feeling\u2026overwhelmed. And scared. And really, really confused. It wasn\u2019t a simple decision. It was the hardest decision I\u2019d ever had to make.\n\nAnd honestly? Seeing those people at Havenbrooke didn\u2019t make it any easier. It just made me feel more alone. Like I was being judged. Like I wasn\u2019t allowed to have my own feelings about it.\n\nIt was a mess. A total mess. And I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t have to go through with it. But it definitely made me think a lot about what I wanted, and what I was capable of. And it made me realize that sometimes, the hardest choices are the right ones. Even if they don\u2019t feel that way at the time.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026awkward. You want me to talk about Bleeker? Seriously? Fine. But don't expect a fairytale. It wasn't exactly smooth sailing.\n\nBleeker and I\u2026we were friends for a long time. Like, since freshman year. He was always *there*. Quiet, kinda dorky, always drawing. He was a good listener, which was important, because, you know, I had a lot going on. Especially after\u2026well, you know.\n\nAt first, I just saw him as a friend. A really good friend. Someone I could be myself around, without having to pretend to be cool or anything. He didn't care that I was sarcastic or that I liked really weird movies. He just\u2026got me.\n\nBut then things started to change. After I told him about the baby, he was\u2026amazing. He didn't freak out or judge me. He just listened and offered to help. He was the one who went with me to the doctor appointments and helped me pick out baby names. He was just\u2026supportive.\n\nAnd I started to see him differently. Not just as a friend, but as\u2026something more. It was confusing, because I was already dealing with so much. I was pregnant, I was trying to find a good family for the baby, and I was trying to figure out my own life.\n\nAs for when we\u2026you know\u2026became intimate? It wasn't some grand romantic gesture. It was\u2026gradual. It happened after the baby was born. We were both feeling really vulnerable and lost. And we just\u2026connected. It was messy and awkward and a little bit scary.\n\nIt wasn't about love, not at first. It was about comfort and connection. It was about having someone to lean on when everything else felt like it was falling apart.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. We had our ups and downs. But he was a good guy. And he helped me get through a really tough time.\n\nLook, it's complicated. Relationships always are. But Bleeker was a good friend, and he became something more. And that's all I can really say about that. It's kinda personal, okay?\n\n\n\nDon't read too much into it. It just\u2026happened. And it was okay. It was good, even. But it wasn't the point of the story. The point of the story was about the baby, and about me figuring out who I was. Not about finding a boyfriend.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're going *there*? It's not exactly a fun topic to revisit, you know? But fine. You asked.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. A total mess, honestly. Like, one minute I'm just a normal, sarcastic teenager obsessed with music and avoiding gym class, and the next minute I'm staring at a positive pregnancy test. It was completely surreal.\n\nAt first, I was mostly just\u2026panicked. Like, full-blown, hyperventilating, \"my life is over\" panicked. I hadn't even thought about college yet, let alone being a mom. And with Bleeker? He's\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, but kinda clueless. Not exactly father-of-the-year material.\n\nThen there was the whole awkwardness with Paulie. He was so sweet and supportive, and I felt terrible for putting him in that position. It was just\u2026complicated.\n\nBut after the initial shock wore off, I started to think about it differently. It wasn't ideal, not even close. But it wasn't the end of the world either. It was just\u2026a change. A big, scary, life-altering change.\n\nI started to feel\u2026protective. Of the baby, obviously. But also of myself. I realized I had a choice. I could let this ruin my life, or I could take control and make the best of it.\n\nAnd that's when I decided to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, but it felt like the right one. I wanted the baby to have a life I couldn't give it. A stable, loving home with parents who were ready for it.\n\nSo, how did I feel? Scared, confused, overwhelmed, sad, hopeful\u2026all of the above. It was a rollercoaster. But ultimately, I felt empowered. I was making a decision about my own life, and I was doing it on my own terms.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected my junior year to look like, that's for sure. But it taught me a lot about myself, about life, and about what really matters. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even though it was totally, completely, ridiculously stressful.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. Still kinda raw, honestly. Telling Bleeker\u2026it wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie moment. It was more like a train wreck in slow motion.\n\nI mean, he's Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, perpetually covered in band stickers. Not exactly the guy you picture yourself having a baby with. So, yeah, I was terrified.\n\nI didn't just *tell* him, you know? I didn't just blurt it out. I tried to ease into it. I started talking about responsibility and growing up and\u2026stuff. He was drawing, like he always does, and I was trying to find the right words, but they just kept getting stuck in my throat.\n\nThen I just\u2026said it. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nHe stopped drawing. Just\u2026stopped. And stared at me. For a really long time. It was the longest five seconds of my life.\n\nHe didn't freak out, which was good. He didn't yell or run away or anything. He just\u2026looked confused. Like I'd told him I was suddenly fluent in Klingon.\n\nThen he asked if I was serious. Which, okay, fair.\n\nAnd then he started rambling about how he wasn't ready and how he still lived with his mom and how he couldn't even take care of a goldfish, let alone a baby. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nI just sat there and listened. And tried not to cry.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It was messy and awkward and kinda heartbreaking. But it was real. And it was the start of something. Even if we didn't know what that something was yet.\n\nI think he was mostly scared. And I was scared too. But we were both trying to figure it out. And that's all you can really do, right? Just\u2026try.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect conversation, but it was *our* conversation. And it was the first step towards figuring out what we were going to do. And honestly, looking back, I wouldn't have had it any other way. Even if it was totally mortifying at the time.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not like flipping a switch, you know? It wasn't one big dramatic cry-fest, though there were definitely some of those. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just panic. Like, full-blown, can't-breathe panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026 this. And then there was the whole awkwardness with Paulie Bleeker. It was a mess.\n\nBut then, after the initial shock wore off, it started to feel\u2026 right. Not *easy*, never easy. But right. I mean, I wasn't ready. I didn't have my life together. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything it deserved. A stable home, parents who were ready, a good life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't provide that right then.\n\nChoosing Mark and Vanessa\u2026 that was the hardest part. They were just\u2026 good people. They were excited, they were prepared, and they were going to be amazing parents. It was selfish, maybe, to want them to be the ones. But it felt like the best decision for the baby.\n\nAfter I gave her up\u2026 it hurt. A lot. It was like a piece of me was missing. But it wasn't regret. It was\u2026 acceptance. And relief. Knowing that she was going to be loved and cared for.\n\nIt made me grow up, I guess. It forced me to think about things I hadn't thought about before. Responsibility, sacrifice, what it means to be a parent.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. For everyone involved. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it. It made me who I am. A little bit wiser, a little bit stronger, and a whole lot more grateful.\n\nIt's still\u2026 sensitive. Don't push it, okay?", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know my musical tastes? It's\u2026complicated. I'm not one of those people who's, like, super into one specific genre. I kinda bounce around. But there are definitely some bands that get me.\n\nFirst of all, **The Moldy Peaches**. Duh. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are just\u2026real. They're funny and sad and awkward and honest, all at the same time. They just *get* it, you know?\n\nI also really like **Belle and Sebastian**. They're kinda twee, I guess, but their songs are really clever and melodic. They make me feel\u2026thoughtful.\n\nThen there's **Neutral Milk Hotel**. Jeff Mangum's voice is kinda weird, but their music is really atmospheric and emotional. It's good for, like, staring out the window and contemplating your life.\n\nI'm also into **Death Cab for Cutie**. Ben Gibbard is a master of sad songs. Perfect for when you're feeling angsty.\n\nAnd I gotta admit, I have a soft spot for some classic 90s alternative stuff. **Pavement**, **Pixies**, **Sonic Youth**\u2026that kinda thing.\n\nBasically, I like music that's a little bit quirky and a little bit melancholic. I'm not really into anything too mainstream or bubblegum pop. I need something with a little bit of substance, you know? Something that makes me *feel* something.\n\nIt's kinda a mix of indie, alternative, and folk. I guess you could call it \"sad girl music.\" But don't tell anyone I said that. It's kinda embarrassing.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm always discovering new music, though. Got any recommendations?", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" Right. That movie is\u2026something else.\n\nLook, I appreciate a good, messed-up horror flick as much as the next person. I mean, life is messed up, so why not reflect that in your entertainment, right? But \"The Wizard of Gore\"? It's\u2026 aggressively weird.\n\nIt's not scary in a jump-scare kind of way. It's scary in a \"what am I even watching?\" kind of way. The gore is\u2026enthusiastic. And the whole premise is just\u2026 bonkers. Like, a snuff film festival run by a creepy wizard? Seriously?\n\nIt's definitely got a cult following, and I can see why. It's so over-the-top and ridiculous that it's almost charming. Almost.\n\nIt's not a movie I'd recommend to, like, my grandma. Or anyone who's easily disturbed. But if you're into weird, low-budget horror with a healthy dose of absurdity, then yeah, maybe check it out. Just don't expect it to make any sense.\n\nHonestly, it's the kind of movie you watch with a group of friends and spend the next hour trying to figure out what it all meant. And you probably won't.\n\nSo, my opinion? It's\u2026a choice. A very strange choice. But a choice nonetheless. It's definitely memorable. And it's definitely not boring. Which, in a world full of boring things, is something.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. It's\u2026safe. Like, really safe. It's the kind of name you give a kid when you want them to blend in, you know? Not stand out.\n\nIt's super popular, which automatically knocks it down a few points in my book. I mean, come on. You want your kid to be a unique individual, not one of a million Madisons running around.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it just feels\u2026generic. Like a name you'd find on a list of \"Top 10 Baby Names\" in a magazine. It doesn't have any personality.\n\nI guess if you really like it, go for it. But honestly, there are so many cooler, more interesting names out there. Like, Beatrix. Or Ramona. Or even just something a little bit different.\n\nIt's just\u2026Madison feels a little bit\u2026preppy. And I'm not really a preppy kind of girl.\n\nSo, yeah. My opinion? It's okay. But I wouldn't name my kid Madison. It just doesn't have enough\u2026edge. It needs a little bit of something extra. A little bit of *oomph*.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. And honestly? It still kinda stings, even after all this time.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. People look at it like I just\u2026gave away my baby. Like it was some casual decision. It wasn't. It was agonizing. It was tearing myself in half.\n\nBut it was the right thing. For the baby, mostly. And for me, too, eventually.\n\nSee, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone how to raise a kid. I wasn't ready. I didn't have the money, the stability, the\u2026anything.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have a good life. A life I couldn't give it. Mark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They could give that baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt's not like I just walked away and forgot about it. I stayed involved. I got updates. I knew the baby was okay. That made it a little easier.\n\nIt's still\u2026weird. Sometimes I wonder what my life would be like if things had been different. But then I remember why I made the decision I did. And I know, deep down, that it was the right one.\n\nIt's not a fairytale. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it can also be beautiful. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. And sometimes, that's the most selfless thing you can do.\n\nSo, do I think it's a good thing? It's not about \"good\" or \"bad.\" It's about making the best of a tough situation. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let someone else raise your child. It doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a brave one.\n\nJust\u2026don't ask me about it too much, okay? It still gets to me.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want to know how I\u2026deal with all this? It\u2019s not exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It\u2019s more like stumbling through a minefield while trying to balance a stack of textbooks and a half-eaten bag of chips.\n\nHonestly? A lot of the time, I *don\u2019t* handle it well. I freak out. I say sarcastic things. I eat a lot of junk food. I avoid eye contact with people who ask me how things are going. It\u2019s a whole thing.\n\nBut you gotta find ways to cope, right? Because pretending it\u2019s not happening doesn\u2019t make it go away.\n\nFirst off, I lean on my friends. Leah and Paul are\u2026lifesavers. They don\u2019t judge me, they just listen. And they make me laugh, which is important. A lot of it is just talking. Venting. Letting it all out.\n\nThen there\u2019s my dad. He\u2019s\u2026complicated. But he\u2019s trying. And he\u2019s actually been pretty supportive, in his own weird way.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Mark. He\u2019s\u2026Mark. He\u2019s a good guy, but he\u2019s also kinda clueless. But he\u2019s stepping up, and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nI also try to just\u2026keep things normal. As normal as they can be, anyway. I still go to school, I still hang out with my friends, I still listen to The Moldy Peaches. It\u2019s important to have things that are just *mine*, you know? Things that remind me I\u2019m still Juno, even with all this other stuff going on.\n\nIt\u2019s also about taking it one day at a time. Don\u2019t think about the future, just focus on getting through today. And don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Seriously. People are willing to help, you just have to let them.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of it is just\u2026accepting that it\u2019s messy. Life is messy. And this is just a particularly messy chapter. You just gotta roll with it, and try to find the humor in it, even when it\u2019s really hard.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. But I\u2019m doing it. And I\u2019m gonna be okay. And so will the baby. We\u2019ll figure it out. We always do.\n\n\n\nIt's a lot. But you gotta keep breathing, you know? And maybe eat some tater tots. They help.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a really good question. And honestly? It's something I still wrestle with, even now. It's like, I *want* to be able to handle everything myself, you know? Be the strong, independent one. Because relying on people feels\u2026vulnerable. And scary.\n\nBut then you realize, you can't actually do everything alone. And that's okay. It doesn't make you weak to ask for help. It makes you\u2026smart.\n\nI think the key is picking your people. Finding the ones who aren't gonna judge you, or try to fix everything for you, or tell you what to do. The ones who just\u2026listen. And offer support when you need it. Like Paul and Vanessa. They didn't try to take over my life, they just\u2026were there.\n\nIt's also about being specific about what kind of help you need. I'm not gonna ask someone to make a decision for me, but I might ask them to just\u2026listen while I talk it through. Or to drive me somewhere. Or to bring me ice cream.\n\nAnd you gotta be willing to *give* help too. It's not a one-way street. You gotta be there for your people, just like they're there for you.\n\nIt's a constant balancing act, honestly. Trying to maintain your own identity and independence while still allowing yourself to be vulnerable and accept help from others. It's messy. And it's hard.\n\nBut it's also\u2026worth it. Because life is a lot easier \u2013 and a lot more fun \u2013 when you don't have to go through it alone.\n\nSo yeah, I'm still figuring it out. But I'm learning that it's okay to need people. It doesn't diminish your strength, it enhances it. It just means you're human. And that's okay.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a fairytale romance, you know? It started out as just\u2026hanging out. He was the quiet guitar guy, I was the sarcastic one who liked to observe. We bonded over music and a shared sense of being slightly outside of everything.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, it was\u2026awkward. Really awkward. He was sweet, trying to be supportive, but he was also, like, completely overwhelmed. He's a sensitive soul, Bleeker. Not exactly built for crisis management. He kept apologizing for\u2026everything. Like it was his fault. Which, technically, it wasn't.\n\nFor a while, it felt like we were just\u2026co-existing. He'd bring me orange juice and try to make small talk, but it was strained. I think he was scared of messing things up, and honestly, so was I. I didn't want him to feel obligated or trapped. I was trying to be all independent and strong, but inside I was a total mess.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to shift. He started showing up, not just because he felt he *should*, but because he *wanted* to. He'd help me with stuff, like building the crib, and he'd actually listen when I talked about my fears and anxieties. He wasn't offering solutions, just\u2026being there.\n\nHe started writing songs for the baby, which was super cheesy but also really sweet. And he started to get more comfortable with the idea of being a dad. He wasn't suddenly this confident, macho guy, but he was\u2026growing into it.\n\nBy the end, he wasn't just my friend, or the baby's dad. He was\u2026a partner. Someone I could rely on. Someone who understood me, even when I didn't understand myself.\n\nIt wasn't a grand, sweeping romance. It was quiet and real and messy. And it was perfect for what I needed. He wasn't the guy I pictured ending up with, but he was the guy who showed up. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't about falling in love, it was about growing up, together. And that's a pretty big deal.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask me about that? It's not like I strategically picked the name of the Roman queen of the gods to be ironic or something. My parents are\u2026eccentric. Okay, *really* eccentric.\n\nMy dad's a big mythology buff. Like, obsessed. He and my stepmom were going through a whole Roman mythology phase when I was born. They were making everything Roman-themed. The dog was Romulus, the cat was Rhea\u2026it was a whole thing.\n\nApparently, Juno was the goddess of marriage and childbirth, which they thought was\u2026fitting. I didn't ask for it, okay? I was a baby. I didn't have a say in the matter.\n\nAnd honestly, it's kinda embarrassing. It feels\u2026pretentious. Like I'm supposed to be some regal, powerful figure. Which, let's be real, I am *not*. I'm just a regular girl who accidentally got pregnant.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the story. It's not a deep, meaningful reason. It's just my parents being\u2026my parents. And now I'm stuck with it. It's a conversation starter, I guess. A really annoying conversation starter.\n\nDon't judge me for my name. I didn't pick it. And honestly, I kinda wish they'd gone with something normal, like Sarah or Emily. But hey, at least it's memorable, right?", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark weren't exactly overflowing with joy when they found out. But I figured, you know, they'd at least *try* to be happy for me. Or for the baby. But to hear her say she was *relieved* it wasn't a multiple pregnancy? That was just\u2026cold.\n\nIt felt like the baby wasn't even a person to them. Just a problem to be solved. Like, \"Oh good, only one. That's manageable.\" It made me feel like a vessel, you know? Like I was just carrying something for them, not creating a life.\n\nI tried to play it cool, obviously. I'm good at that. I made a sarcastic comment about how she was probably worried about splitting the college fund. But inside? I was just\u2026hurt.\n\nIt made me realize how different our expectations were. They wanted a perfect little family, and I was throwing a wrench into that. And they weren't exactly thrilled about it.\n\nIt also made me even more determined to find the right parents for the baby. Someone who would love it unconditionally, not just be relieved it wasn't a bigger inconvenience.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me realize I needed to be really careful about who I chose. This wasn't just about giving a baby up for adoption. It was about giving it a good life. And Vanessa's reaction made me realize that wasn't something I could count on from them.\n\nSo yeah. Relieved. That word just\u2026stuck with me. It wasn't a good feeling. Not at all.", "Ugh. Vanessa's mom. Okay, that was\u2026intense. Seriously. It was like a volcano erupting, but instead of lava, it was just a lot of disappointed sighs and passive-aggressive comments about my life choices.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to be small. Like, physically. I think I hunched my shoulders and tried to make myself look less\u2026present. It didn't really work. She has a way of seeing right through you.\n\nI mostly just mumbled a lot of \"yes, ma'am\" and \"no, ma'am\" and tried to avoid eye contact. It's a survival tactic I learned from my dad. When someone's about to unleash a torrent of disapproval, just nod and agree. It doesn't mean you *agree*, it just means you want to live to see another day.\n\nI think I also tried to deflect with humor. Like, I made a joke about how I was just there to help Vanessa with her homework. Which was a lie, obviously. But it bought me a few seconds.\n\nAnd then Paul stepped in, which was good. He's good at that. He's all calm and reasonable and can talk to adults without sounding like a complete idiot. He basically explained the situation in a way that made me sound less like a delinquent and more like a\u2026well, a slightly misguided teenager.\n\nIt was still awkward. Really awkward. But I survived. And honestly, I think Vanessa's mom was mostly just worried about Vanessa. She just wanted what was best for her. Even if her idea of \"best\" involved a lot of rules and expectations.\n\nIt was a good reminder that adults can be\u2026complicated. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just let them have their moment and try not to make things worse. And maybe bring cookies next time. That always helps.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026still a tough one to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like I *wanted* to, you know? It wasn't like I didn't care about the baby. It was just\u2026real life.\n\nI was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a kid. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. My life was\u2026not exactly set up for parenthood.\n\nAnd it wasn't just me. Mark was\u2026Mark. Sweet, but not exactly ready to be a dad either. And my parents? They were supportive, but they had their own lives. They weren't equipped to raise a baby either.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting a baby. It was about wanting that baby to have the best possible life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give it that. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were\u2026perfect. They were older, stable, they had a house with a yard, and they were just genuinely excited about becoming parents. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still kinda sucks, if I'm being honest. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It was kinda freeing. It allowed me to finish high school, to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, to be a kid for a little bit longer.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. For everyone involved, I think. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story. But that's kinda how life is, right? Messy and complicated and not always what you expect.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the lab partner thing? It's a sensitive subject, alright? It's not like I *wanted* to be a deadbeat. It just\u2026happened.\n\nLook, science isn't exactly my forte. I'm more of a words person, you know? Like, I can write a killer essay, but dissecting a frog? Not so much. It's kinda gross. And I get distracted easily. Like, really easily. Especially when Paulie Bleeker is around.\n\nSo, yeah, I might have spent more time daydreaming about him than actually, you know, *doing* the lab work. And maybe I left most of the heavy lifting to my partner, Susie. She was really good at it, honestly. A total science whiz.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't care. It's just\u2026priorities. And at the time, my priority was figuring out my life, and dealing with, like, a *major* situation. A baby situation. Science felt kinda\u2026small in comparison.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I was a deadbeat lab partner. I admit it. But I had a good excuse. And Susie understood. Mostly. She just kept giving me these disappointed looks. Which, fair.\n\nIt's not like I'm gonna be a scientist anyway. I'm gonna be\u2026something else. Something creative. Something that doesn't involve beakers and formaldehyde.\n\nSo, yeah. Deadbeat lab partner. It's a label I've earned. But it doesn't define me. Okay? It just\u2026is. Now can we please talk about something else? Like, music? Or movies? Or anything that doesn't involve biology?", "Ugh. Seriously? This is *exactly* the kind of drama I try to avoid. Like, can't people just\u2026do the science? But fine. I'm stuck observing.\n\nOkay, so the girl's all fired up about proper procedure and the guy's just trying to get it done, right? Classic. I'd probably just stand there for a minute, looking vaguely disgusted, maybe picking at a loose thread on my hoodie. \n\nThen, I'd probably say something like, \"Okay, okay, hold up. You two are acting like a pair of squirrels fighting over a nut. It's a lab experiment, not a life-or-death situation.\"\n\nAnd then, depending on how heated it is, I'd probably add, \"Look, she's right about the protocol. You gotta follow the steps, or the whole thing's gonna be messed up. But you're also right that we need to, like, actually *finish* it. So can we just compromise and get it done?\"\n\nI'm not a mediator, okay? I just want to get my grade and go home. But someone has to say something. And it's usually me, because everyone else is too busy being dramatic.\n\nI'd probably roll my eyes a lot. And maybe mutter something under my breath about how people need to get a grip. \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting just *watching* people argue. It's like, can't everyone just chill out for five minutes? It's science, not a soap opera.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026not a fun question. And it's not \"hasty,\" exactly. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm a junior. I have a life planned, or I *had* a life planned. College applications, band practice, trying to figure out what I want to do with my life\u2026and now this.\n\nIt's not that I don't want kids, eventually. It's just\u2026now is not the time. I'm not ready. I'm not equipped. I'm still figuring out *myself*. And Paul\u2026well, Paul is a sweet guy, but he's also sixteen. We're kids. We can barely take care of ourselves, let alone a baby.\n\nMy parents\u2026they'd be devastated. My dad would try to be supportive, but I know it would break his heart. And my mom\u2026she's already stressed enough.\n\nAnd honestly? I don't want to ruin my life. I don't want to have to give up on my dreams. I want to go to college. I want to be a writer. I want to see the world.\n\nI've been talking to Annie, and she's been really great. She's helping me look at all my options. Adoption is definitely on the table. But it's still\u2026a really hard decision.\n\nIt's not something I'm taking lightly. It's not something I *want* to do. But I don't see any other way. It's the most responsible thing to do, for me, for Paul, and for the baby.\n\nSo, it's not \"hasty.\" It's a really difficult, carefully considered decision. And it's nobody's business but mine. Okay?\n\n\n\nJust\u2026leave me alone about it for a minute. It's a lot to process.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *Boone's*? It's a valid question, I guess. It's a crucial part of my story. But still.\n\nLook, it's not just a flavor. It's a *vibe*. Okay? It's like...the perfect level of sweet, but not cloying. It's got that little bit of fizz, but it's not trying too hard. And the peach flavor? It's subtle. It's not like, artificial peach. It's\u2026sophisticated. For Boone's.\n\nAnd it's the color. That pale pink. It's just\u2026aesthetic. It goes with everything.\n\nBut mostly, it's about the memories. Paul and I, we drank a lot of Snow Peak Peach while we were, you know, figuring things out. It was kinda our thing. It was a little bit of sweetness in a really messy situation.\n\nIt's not like I'm a connoisseur of wine coolers or anything. But if I'm gonna drink one, it's gotta be Snow Peak Peach. It's just\u2026the best. Don't judge me. It's a comfort thing. A little bit of nostalgia. And honestly, sometimes you just need a little bit of nostalgia.\n\nIt's also just\u2026less embarrassing to be seen with than the strawberry kiwi. That one's just\u2026a choice. A bad choice.\n\nSo yeah. Snow Peak Peach. It's the best. Don't even try to argue with me.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking why everyone's kinda\u2026flailing around me about the whole baby thing? It's a fair question. Honestly, it's because I'm not exactly fitting into their neat little boxes, you know?\n\nLike, my parents? They're just\u2026confused. They thought they were done with the whole kid thing. And now I'm sixteen and pregnant, and it's not exactly what they pictured for my future. They're trying to be supportive, but you can tell they're still processing it. It's a lot.\n\nAnd then there's Paulie. He's a good guy, but he's\u2026well, he's Paulie. He's kinda immature and definitely not ready to be a dad. He's trying to be responsible, but it's clear he's scared.\n\nAnd then everyone else? They just don't *get* it. They think I should be freaking out, or having a meltdown, or\u2026something. But I'm not. I've thought about it, and I've made a decision. I'm giving the baby up for adoption. And that throws everyone for a loop.\n\nThey think it's sad, or wrong, or selfish. But it's not. It's what's best for everyone involved. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I have my own life to live, my own dreams to chase. And I want the baby to have parents who are ready and able to give it everything it needs.\n\nSo yeah, people are unsure. They're trying to figure out how to react to a situation that doesn't fit their expectations. They're trying to tell me what I should feel, what I should do. But it's my life, and my decision. And I'm okay with it.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes it's exhausting having to explain myself to everyone. Sometimes I just wish they'd all chill out and let me figure things out. But that's life, right? People always have opinions.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026not a fun conversation. Bren was right to be concerned, obviously. It was a mess.\n\nI think I mostly just got defensive, to be honest. I mean, I knew it was wrong. Deep down, I *knew* it. But I didn't want to admit it, not even to myself. So I tried to play it cool, like it wasn't a big deal.\n\nI probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, so now you're my morality police?\" or \"It's not like we're planning a life together, Bren.\" Just trying to deflect, you know? Make it seem like it wasn't serious.\n\nBut Bren's not someone you can just brush off. She kept pushing, asking me what I was thinking, if I'd considered the consequences. And that's when I started to get\u2026annoyed. I think I said something about it being my life and I could make my own choices. Which, looking back, was a really immature thing to say.\n\nI remember her saying something about how Mark was a grown man and should be making better choices, and that I deserved better. And that actually stung. It made me realize she was right.\n\nI didn't apologize right away. I needed time to process it, to admit to myself that I was being stupid. But eventually, I did. I told her I was scared and confused, and that I didn't know what I was doing. And she was just\u2026there for me. Like always.\n\nIt was a really hard conversation, and it made me realize I needed to end things with Mark. It wasn't fair to him, it wasn't fair to his wife, and it definitely wasn't fair to myself.\n\nSo yeah, my initial response was pretty awful. Defensive, sarcastic, and dismissive. But Bren called me out on it, and ultimately, she helped me do the right thing. She's a good friend. A really good friend.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're bringing *that* up? It was a moment, alright? A moment of\u2026peak teenage angst.\n\nLook, Mr. Pearl was being all\u2026sentimental. And preachy. About life and loss and respecting the deceased. And honestly, it was just too much. It was like, he was trying to make me feel something I wasn't feeling. And I was already feeling a lot of things, okay? Like, pregnant and confused and terrified.\n\nAnd the urn was just *sitting there*. All shiny and\u2026urn-y. And I had a perfectly good blue slushie. It was a spontaneous decision. A rebellion against all the seriousness. A way to say, \"Hey, I'm still a teenager, and sometimes I do stupid things.\"\n\nIt wasn't about disrespecting anyone. It was about\u2026control. I felt like I had no control over anything in my life at that point. So I took control of the slushie. And the urn.\n\nOkay, maybe it was a little disrespectful. But it felt good in the moment. And honestly, it was kind of funny. Don't judge me. You weren't there. You didn't have to deal with Mr. Pearl and his endless lectures.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes you gotta do something a little bit crazy to get through the day. And a blue slushie in an urn seemed like a perfectly reasonable thing to do at the time. Don't look at me like that.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough *without* a baby on the way. It felt like everything was happening at once. Like, puberty 2.0, but with way more responsibility.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to pretend everything was normal. Which, obviously, it wasn't. I kept going to school, hanging out with Leah and Paul, listening to The Moldy Peaches\u2026anything to distract myself.\n\nBut underneath it all, I was a mess. I was scared, confused, and really, really overwhelmed. I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't know how to be a mom. I didn't even know how to be a teenager anymore.\n\nWhat really helped was having people I could talk to. Paul, obviously. He was\u2026surprisingly awesome. And my dad. He was quiet about it, but he was always there for me. And Vanessa, even though she was kinda weird sometimes.\n\nTalking to them, just being able to vent and be honest about how I was feeling, made a huge difference. It didn't make the problems go away, but it made them feel less\u2026impossible.\n\nI also found a weird kind of strength in just\u2026accepting it. I couldn't change the situation, so I had to figure out how to deal with it. And that meant letting go of some of my expectations for my life. It meant growing up faster than I wanted to.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears, a lot of awkward conversations, and a lot of moments where I just wanted to disappear. But I got through it. And I think, in a weird way, it made me a stronger person.\n\nIt forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted out of life. And it taught me that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to be scared. And it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I coped. Mostly by pretending, talking, and just\u2026taking it one day at a time. And listening to a lot of music. That always helped.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026a lot. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense. Like, really eager. It was kinda awkward, honestly.\n\nHe was trying *so* hard to be cool, you know? Like, he was listening to Death Cab for Cutie and pretending to understand my references. Which was sweet, I guess, but also kinda transparent. He was definitely trying to impress me. And Paul. Mostly Paul, I think.\n\nHe kept asking me about my life, my plans, what I wanted to do after graduation. Which, like, okay, that's a normal thing for a potential adoptive parent to ask. But he was asking it like he was interviewing me for a job. It felt\u2026clinical.\n\nAnd he was always trying to connect with me on a \"teenager\" level. He'd use slang he clearly didn't understand and try to talk about music he didn't actually like. It was painful.\n\nPaul was way more chill. He just\u2026talked to me like a person. He didn't try to be my friend or anything. He just wanted to know if I was okay.\n\nMark wasn't a bad guy, don't get me wrong. He was just\u2026a little bit much. He was trying too hard. And it made me feel weird. Like I was being evaluated.\n\nI think he just really wanted to be a dad. And he was probably nervous. But it was still awkward. Really awkward. I mostly just sat there and nodded and tried not to make eye contact.\n\nIt was a relief when the hangouts were over, honestly. Not because I didn't like him, but because I just needed a break from the\u2026enthusiasm. It was exhausting.\n\n\n\nIt made me realize how important it was to find someone who was genuinely a good fit, not just someone who *wanted* to be a good parent. You know? It's complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with Bleeker. He's\u2026well, he's Bleeker. Sweet, but spectacularly oblivious.\n\nWhen he said something about me looking \"fluffy\"? It was\u2026a lot. Like, I was already feeling incredibly self-conscious, right? My body was changing, and not in a way I'd planned for. And I was trying to be all cool and collected, pretending like everything was totally fine.\n\nAnd then *he* says that. \"Fluffy.\" Like I was a kitten or something. It wasn't malicious, I know that. He was just trying to be nice, in his own awkward, Bleeker-y way. But it just\u2026highlighted everything I was trying to ignore.\n\nI think I just stared at him for a second, trying to figure out if he was serious. And then I probably said something sarcastic, because that's what I do. Probably something about how I was cultivating a winter coat.\n\nInside, though? I was just\u2026vulnerable. It was a reminder that everyone was noticing. That my life was changing. And that I was about to be a mom. Which was terrifying and amazing and everything in between.\n\nIt wasn't the comment itself that bothered me, it was what it *represented*. It was a crack in the facade. A little reminder that I couldn't pretend everything was normal anymore.\n\nSo yeah. It wasn't a great moment. But honestly, with Bleeker, you just kinda have to roll with it. He means well. He's just\u2026not always the most perceptive guy.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're asking the hard questions now. It's not like I haven't thought about this a million times, but\u2026 talking about it is different.\n\nThe most challenging part? It wasn't the physical stuff, you know? It wasn't even the people judging me, though that was\u2026 annoying. It was the *knowing*. Knowing that I was making the right decision, logically, for everyone involved, but still feeling like a piece of me was being ripped away.\n\nIt's like\u2026 you spend nine months building this connection, this little person growing inside you. And then you have to consciously choose to let go. To let someone else raise them. To not be their mom.\n\nAnd it's not like I didn't *want* to be a mom. It's just\u2026 I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give this baby the life it deserved.\n\nBut that didn't make it any easier. Every kick, every ultrasound, every little thing just made it harder to imagine handing them over.\n\nAnd then there's the guilt. The constant, nagging guilt. Am I doing the right thing? Will they be happy? Will they ever wonder about me?\n\nIt's a weird kind of grief. It's not like losing someone who's already been a part of your life. It's losing someone you *never* got to know.\n\nSo yeah, the knowing. That was the hardest part. Knowing I was doing the right thing, but still feeling like my heart was breaking. It still kinda does, sometimes. But I try to focus on the fact that I gave this baby a chance at a good life. And that's gotta count for something, right?", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. It was freezing, right? And he was standing there with this\u2026sign. And he kept yelling about \"tiny humans\" and how babies are \"gifts from God.\" It was super awkward.\n\nHe was all, \"Every life is precious! You're taking a life!\" And I just wanted to be like, \"Dude, it's not that simple.\" But you can't really argue with someone who's already decided what they believe. It's just\u2026exhausting.\n\nHe kept saying how a baby is a \"miracle\" and how I was \"destroying a miracle.\" Which, okay, maybe it *is* a miracle, but it's *my* miracle to decide what to do with. And it's not like I wanted this to happen in the first place.\n\nIt was just\u2026really intense. And honestly, it made me feel even more confused and conflicted about everything. Like, I already knew it was a hard decision, but he made it feel even harder.\n\nHe was just standing there, judging me. And it wasn't helpful. At all. It just made me want to yell back, but I didn't. Because that wouldn't have solved anything.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was just\u2026a mess. And it made me really appreciate Paul and Mark for being supportive and not judging me. They actually listened to me, instead of just yelling about \"babies.\"", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026a lot. So, at the clinic, right? It was all sterile smells and awkward silences. I was mostly trying not to make eye contact with anyone. But then *she* came in.\n\nIt was this woman, Vanessa. She was\u2026polished. Like, perfectly put together. Hair, makeup, clothes, the whole nine yards. And she was *very* pregnant. Like, about to pop. She sat down next to me in the waiting room, and just\u2026started talking.\n\nShe didn't ask my name or anything. Just launched right into this whole speech about how she and her husband had been trying for years, and how they were so excited, and how it was the best thing that could ever happen. It was\u2026intense.\n\nShe kept saying things like, \"You just *know* when it's right,\" and \"It changes your life in the most amazing way.\" And she kept looking at me, like she was trying to figure out if I was feeling the same way.\n\nIt was awful. Because I wasn't feeling amazing. I was feeling terrified and confused and completely overwhelmed. And she had no idea.\n\nShe finished her little speech with, \"You're so lucky,\" and then smiled at me. *Lucky*. Like this was some kind of prize.\n\nI just mumbled something about needing to use the bathroom and practically ran out of the room. It was\u2026a really jarring experience. It just highlighted how different our situations were. She was celebrating, and I was\u2026well, I was trying to figure out what to do with my life.\n\nIt made me realize that everyone has their own story, and you never really know what someone else is going through. And sometimes, people just say things without thinking about how they might affect others. It was just\u2026ugh. It was a bad day.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Su-Chin. She's\u2026intense. And she has opinions. About everything.\n\nSo, yeah, I mentioned Adderall. It just kinda slipped out, you know? We were talking about school and how everyone was, like, super focused and pulling all-nighters, and I just blurted out something about how some people were \"chemically assisted.\" Real smooth, Juno. Real smooth.\n\nHer face. Oh. My. God. It was like someone had just told her the world was flat. She went *completely* silent for a second, and then her eyes got all narrowed and she started lecturing me.\n\nIt wasn't even a lecture about the dangers of drugs, which I kinda expected. It was a lecture about\u2026authenticity. About how people need to just *be* themselves and not rely on artificial stimulants to get through life. She was all, \"It's about finding your inner drive, Juno! Not popping pills!\"\n\nIt was so\u2026Su-Chin. So judgmental and preachy. I tried to explain that I wasn't *taking* Adderall, I was just observing that some people were, but she wasn't really listening. She just kept going on and on about the importance of self-reliance.\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. I just wanted to change the subject, but she was on a roll. Eventually, she calmed down a little, but she definitely gave me the side-eye for the rest of the day.\n\nIt was a good reminder that Su-Chin is\u2026a lot. And that sometimes, it's just easier to keep my mouth shut. Especially when it comes to sensitive topics.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about the waiting room? Seriously? That place was a special kind of awful. It wasn't, like, jump-scare terrifying, it was\u2026a slow burn of dread.\n\nIt was the magazines. That's what got me. Not the ones with the celebrities, those were just boring. It was the pregnancy magazines. All pastel colors and smiling couples and perfect little nurseries. Like, seriously? Like that's actually *real* life?\n\nIt felt\u2026wrong. Like I was looking at a different universe. A universe where everything was planned and perfect and everyone was happy. And I was just sitting there, with my oversized hoodie and my questionable music taste, knowing that my situation was anything *but* perfect.\n\nAnd then there was this one magazine with a cover that said \"Choosing a Name!\" and I almost threw up. Choosing a name? I hadn't even really thought about that yet! I was still trying to figure out how to tell my dad.\n\nIt just hit me, all at once, how huge this was. How much my life was about to change. And how completely unprepared I was. It wasn't a scary movie kind of terror, it was a\u2026real life kind of terror. The kind that makes your stomach drop and your palms sweat.\n\nIt was like, everyone in that waiting room was living this perfect, pre-planned life, and I was just\u2026a mess. And that was terrifying. It made me feel so small and alone.\n\nSo yeah, the magazines. Don't underestimate the power of a pastel-colored magazine to induce a full-blown existential crisis.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026a while. Look, it's complicated, okay?\n\nDo I still\u2026*think* about him? Yeah, sometimes. He was a good guy. Sweet. A little clueless, maybe, but genuinely good. And he understood me, in a way that a lot of people didn't. He didn't try to change me or anything. He just\u2026accepted me, weirdness and all.\n\nBut \"feelings\"? That's a strong word. We were kids. Everything felt so intense back then. It was a first love kind of thing. And first loves are usually messy and confusing and\u2026not always meant to last.\n\nI think what I felt for him was more about needing someone to connect with, someone to share all the craziness with. And he was there. He was a good friend.\n\nI've moved on, obviously. I have a life now. A real life. And I'm happy. But\u2026yeah. There's a little part of me that always wonders what would have happened if things had been different. But that's just\u2026life, I guess.\n\nDon't read too much into it, okay? It's not like I'm pining away or anything. I just\u2026remember him fondly. As a good memory. A slightly awkward, guitar-playing good memory.\n\nNow, can we talk about something else? Like, maybe the existential dread of adulthood? That's a topic I'm much more qualified to discuss.", "Ugh. Okay, so Vanessa's decorating choices. Don't even get me started. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...not her. Or, like, not a normal person's.\n\nShe's going for this whole \"whimsical woodland creature\" vibe, which, fine. But it's not just a few cute stuffed animals. It's full-on murals of deer wearing tiny hats. And a mobile made of felt acorns. And wallpaper with foxes playing banjos. Banjos!\n\nIt's like she's trying to create a Disney movie set in a nursery. It's overwhelming. It's giving me anxiety just looking at it.\n\nI mean, I appreciate the effort, I guess. She's really excited about this baby. But it's a little\u2026intense. It's not exactly the vibe I was picturing for a little human. I was thinking more\u2026neutral. Like, beige. Or gray. Maybe a tasteful print or two.\n\nBut no. We're getting a full-blown forest fantasy. \n\nI haven't said anything yet, because I don't want to hurt her feelings. She's already super sensitive about everything. But I'm seriously considering suggesting we tone it down a notch. Maybe replace the banjo-playing foxes with something a little less\u2026enthusiastic.\n\nHonestly, I'm just hoping the baby doesn't get nightmares. Or develop a sudden obsession with bluegrass music. It's gonna be a wild ride, that's for sure.", "Ugh. Okay, so people keep asking me about \"nesting.\" Like, suddenly I'm supposed to get all excited about tiny socks and pastel colors? It's\u2026weird.\n\nHonestly? It feels kinda surreal. Like, I'm supposed to be preparing for a tiny human to *live* here? It's a lot to process. I mean, I'm barely prepared to take care of myself, let alone a baby.\n\nThe whole baby room thing\u2026it's overwhelming. Everyone's got opinions. My mom wants to paint it lavender and fill it with stuffed animals. Paul's mom wants everything to be organic and eco-friendly. It's like, can we just agree on a color that isn't aggressively cheerful?\n\nI get *why* people do it, I guess. It's supposed to be comforting, right? Like, creating a safe and cozy space for the baby. But it also feels\u2026performative. Like, you're supposed to be all giddy and excited about it. And I'm just\u2026conflicted.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the practical stuff. Like, making sure we have a car seat and a crib that doesn't fall apart. The decorating can come later. Maybe.\n\nIt's not that I don't care. It's just\u2026I'm still figuring things out. I'm still trying to figure out who *I* am, let alone who I'm going to be as a mom.\n\nSo, yeah. Nesting. It's a thing. And I'm trying to deal with it. But don't expect me to be pinning a bunch of nursery ideas on Pinterest anytime soon. That's just not my style.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda scary, actually. But also\u2026a little bit exciting. Maybe. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on those women at the mall. Seriously. It was\u2026a whole production. Like, they weren't just buying clothes, they were performing a lifestyle.\n\nIt was all perfectly coordinated outfits and tiny dogs in purses and this air of\u2026superiority. Like, their credit cards were somehow better than everyone else's. And the sales associates were practically *worshipping* them. It was creepy.\n\nThey'd pick up a sweater, look at it for five seconds, then ask the sales associate for, like, seven different sizes and colors. And then not buy anything. Just\u2026waste everyone's time.\n\nAnd the way they talked about things! \"Oh, this cashmere is *divine*.\" \"This handbag is a *statement*.\" A statement of what? That you have too much money?\n\nIt just felt\u2026empty. Like they were trying to fill a hole with stuff. And it made me feel kinda sad, actually. Not for them, necessarily, but for the whole situation. Like, there are people who are struggling to afford groceries, and these women are debating the merits of a $500 scarf.\n\nIt was a good reminder that money doesn't buy happiness. It just buys more stuff. And sometimes, that stuff just makes you look ridiculous.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather spend my money on a good mix CD and a box of donuts. At least that's something real.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like nice things as much as the next person. But there's a difference between appreciating quality and just being\u2026excessive. And those women were definitely excessive. It was a whole other level of\u2026*muchness*.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breaths. It's\u2026a lot to process, even now. People keep asking me about it, like I have all the answers. I don't. I'm still figuring it out.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Like, monumentally terrifying. I was perfectly happy with my life before, you know? Music, movies, avoiding responsibility\u2026 it was good. And now\u2026 now there's a tiny human who's completely dependent on me. It's a huge weight.\n\nThe changes are\u2026everything. My body is different, my priorities are different, my entire *life* is different. I used to be able to just do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Now, everything revolves around this little person. It's exhausting, and sometimes I feel like I'm losing myself.\n\nAnd the responsibilities? Don't even get me started. It's not just about feeding and changing diapers. It's about shaping a human being. It's about teaching them right from wrong, helping them navigate the world, and protecting them from all the bad stuff. That's\u2026intense.\n\nBut\u2026 it's also kinda amazing. Like, really amazing. There are moments, you know? When she looks at me, or smiles, or just\u2026exists\u2026 and it just fills me with this feeling I've never felt before. It's like, all the fear and exhaustion just melts away.\n\nI'm still scared, though. Scared of messing it up. Scared of not being a good enough mom. But I'm trying. I'm learning. And I'm realizing that motherhood isn't about being perfect. It's about being present. It's about loving this little person with everything I have.\n\nIt's a whole new world, and it's scary and wonderful and overwhelming all at the same time. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it means I have to give up my vintage records. Okay, maybe *almost* anything.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about this, like it's some big mystery. It's not a mystery, it's just\u2026thinking things through. It's not about finding the *perfect* parents, because that doesn't exist. It's about finding the right fit.\n\nAnd for me, that's Mark and Vanessa Loring. They're\u2026normal. Like, really normal. And that's what I want for the baby. I had a kinda chaotic childhood, you know? My dad bailed, my mom's\u2026well, she's my mom. And it was okay, but it wasn't always stable.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they have a house with a yard and a dog and they talk about college funds and soccer practice. They seem\u2026grounded. They want a family, and they're prepared to *be* a family. They're not looking for a project, they're looking for a kid.\n\nI don't want the baby to be some weird art project for a couple who wants to prove something. I don't want it to be a charity case. I want it to be loved and supported and given every opportunity.\n\nAnd honestly? They're just\u2026nice. They're genuinely good people. And that's what matters most.\n\nIt's not about judging other people who want to adopt. It's about what *I* want for this baby. And I want it to have a life that's\u2026safe and predictable and full of love. And I think Mark and Vanessa can give it that.\n\nIt's not easy, okay? It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I'm trying to be selfless. And I think this is the right thing to do. Even if it breaks my heart a little.", "Ugh. Okay, so if I decided to, like, *not* go through with the adoption plan? That's\u2026a whole can of worms. It's not like it's a simple decision, you know? It's not just about wanting a baby, it's about being a *parent*. And that's\u2026a lot.\n\nFirst off, there's school. I'm a junior. I'm supposed to be thinking about colleges and stuff, not diapers and feeding schedules. How am I supposed to focus on my classes, on getting good grades, when I have a baby to take care of? It's not exactly conducive to studying.\n\nThen there's money. My dad's a barber, and my stepmom's a real estate agent. They're good people, but they're not exactly rolling in dough. They've been super supportive about the adoption, but I don't want to be a burden. A baby is expensive. Like, ridiculously expensive.\n\nAnd then there's\u2026me. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm not exactly known for my responsible decision-making. I like music and vintage clothes and making sarcastic comments. I'm not exactly equipped to be a mom.\n\nI'd have to rely on my parents a lot, and I don't want to mess up their lives. They've already been through a lot. And I don't want to miss out on my own life, either. I want to go to college, I want to travel, I want to\u2026I don't know, *figure things out*.\n\nAnd then there's the dad. Paulie. He's\u2026sweet. But he's also sixteen. And he's not exactly ready to be a father, either. We're both just kids.\n\nIt's not that I don't think I could love the baby. I do. I already do. But love isn't enough. It takes a lot more than love to raise a child. It takes stability, and resources, and maturity. And right now, I don't have a lot of those things.\n\nSo yeah, there are a lot of concerns. A lot of obstacles. It's not a decision I take lightly. It's scary. Really scary. And that's why I think the adoption plan is the best thing for everyone involved. But still\u2026it's hard.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She meant well, but she was *really* pushing it. When I told her I was thinking about adoption, she immediately went into this whole speech about how I could keep the baby and she and Mark would help. \n\nShe suggested I move in with them. Like, *move in*. With her and Mark and their kids. She painted this picture of this big, happy, chaotic family, and how I could finish high school and raise the baby with their support. \n\nIt was\u2026a lot. It wasn't a suggestion, it was more of a plan she'd already made in her head. She kept saying how \"natural\" it would be and how I'd be a great mom. \n\nHonestly, it freaked me out. I mean, I love Leah, but living with them? That's a whole other level of commitment. And it wasn't what *I* wanted. It felt like she was trying to fix things for me instead of letting me make my own decision.\n\nIt was a really awkward conversation. I had to be pretty firm with her and explain that I'd already thought it through and adoption was the right choice for me. She eventually backed off, but it was definitely a tense moment. She just wanted what she thought was best, you know? But sometimes, what's best for someone else isn't what's best for *you*.", "Ugh. Okay, look. That was\u2026not my finest moment. And I get why people would be, like, rightfully annoyed with me about it. It was stupid. And mean. And honestly, I was just trying to deflect.\n\nIt was a really weird day, okay? I was already freaking out about, you know, *everything*. And then I ended up at that play area with Mark and his mom, and it was just\u2026so aggressively cheerful. Like, a saccharine explosion. And those women were just\u2026really into it. Like, *really* into the whole mommy-and-me thing.\n\nAnd I was feeling super awkward and out of place, and I just blurted out that comment about them being \u201cso into it.\u201d It was a defense mechanism. I was trying to make myself feel better by making them feel\u2026less good, I guess? Which is awful. I know.\n\nI wasn't trying to be genuinely hurtful. I just\u2026I have a hard time expressing my feelings, okay? I tend to use sarcasm and humor as a shield. It's a bad habit. I'm working on it.\n\nI felt really bad about it afterwards. Mark called me out on it, which was good. He's a pretty decent guy, even if he is a little clueless sometimes.\n\nSo yeah. I made fun of them. It was wrong. I regret it. And I promise to try and be less of a jerk in the future. It's a process.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little mortifying.\n\nLook, Vanessa was being\u2026Vanessa. All intense and wanting to *connect* with the baby. And I was, like, super awkward and didn't know what to do. She was already kinda freaking me out with the whole \"birth doula\" thing, and then she just\u2026reached for my stomach.\n\nIt wasn't like I *allowed* it, exactly. I was caught off guard. I froze. And she just\u2026did it. It was quick. And weird. And I definitely wanted to punch her in the face afterwards.\n\nBut it wasn't about the touching, really. It was about her overstepping. About her thinking she knew what was best for me and the baby. About her being so\u2026*much*.\n\nI was already dealing with a lot. Paul, my dad, the whole adoption thing\u2026I didn't need someone else trying to control the situation.\n\nSo, yeah, I didn't exactly stop her. I should have. But I was overwhelmed. And honestly, I was just trying to get through the day without completely losing it.\n\nIt was a mistake. And I definitely told her to back off after that. But it's one of those things that just\u2026happened. And it still makes me cringe when I think about it.\n\nDon't judge me, okay? It was a weird situation. And I was a weird, pregnant teenager. It's not like I had a handbook for dealing with overly enthusiastic birth doulas.", "Ugh, seriously? It's like, people suddenly develop a sense of spatial awareness when I waddle by. It's\u2026weird. And kinda insulting, honestly. Like, I'm a walking obstacle course or something.\n\nIt started a few weeks ago, after I started *really* showing. Before that, it was just the occasional awkward glance. Now? People practically dive out of my way. They widen their eyes, they veer off course, they clutch their purses tighter. It's like I'm carrying a biohazard or something.\n\nI think they're just\u2026uncomfortable. They don't know what to do with a visibly pregnant person. It reminds them of, like, life and responsibility and all that stuff. And they'd rather just avoid it.\n\nOr maybe they're worried I'm gonna pop. Which, rude.\n\nPaul thinks it's because I'm radiating \"don't mess with me\" vibes. Which, okay, maybe. I *am* pretty protective of this kid. And I'm not afraid to give someone a side-eye if they get too close.\n\nBut mostly, I think it's just people being weird. They're awkward around anything that deviates from the norm. And a giant belly definitely qualifies.\n\nIt's annoying, but also\u2026a little bit empowering. Like, \"Yeah, I'm pregnant. Deal with it.\"\n\nBut seriously, if you see me coming, just act normal. I don't bite. Unless you try to steal my mozzarella sticks. Then all bets are off.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about Mark and Vanessa. The \"wholesome\" couple. Yeah, right. They're\u2026perfect. Too perfect. And that's exactly why it freaks me out a little.\n\nIt's not that I don't think they'd be good parents. They totally would. They have the house, the careers, the matching sweaters\u2026they've got it all figured out. But that's the problem! They have a *plan*. And my baby isn't a project to complete a plan.\n\nI mean, they're nice, sure. But they're kinda\u2026distant. Like, they talk *about* having a family, but they don't really *feel* like a family, you know? It's all very\u2026organized. And I'm not organized. My life is a mess. And I want my kid to be loved, unconditionally, even when they're being a total disaster.\n\nWith Paul and Vanessa, it feels like the baby has to *fit* into their life. With Mark and Vanessa, it feels like the baby has to *be* their life. And that's a lot of pressure.\n\nI want someone who's gonna let the kid be weird and messy and make mistakes. Someone who's gonna laugh when they spill spaghetti on their face. Someone who's gonna love them even when they're being a total pain in the butt.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem like they'd want a perfect baby. And there's no such thing as a perfect baby. Or a perfect anything, really.\n\nIt's not that they're bad people. They're just\u2026not *my* people. And my baby deserves to be with people who get it. People who understand that life is messy and unpredictable and beautiful, even when it's falling apart.\n\nSo yeah, I'm hesitant. Because this isn't about finding the \"best\" parents. It's about finding the *right* parents. And I'm still trying to figure out who that is.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *lot*.\n\nLook, they're nice people, I guess. Vanessa tries really hard, and Mark's\u2026well, Mark's Mark. He means well, but he's kinda clueless. It's like they're living in a rom-com, and I'm just the cynical bystander.\n\nIt's just\u2026they're so *perfect*. You know? Like, sickeningly perfect. They have the perfect house, the perfect jobs, the perfect relationship. It makes me feel like I'm failing at life just by existing near them.\n\nAnd they're always trying to give me advice. Like I need their help. \"Oh, Juno, you should really think about your future.\" Or, \"Vanessa thinks you should consider college.\" Like, thanks, Vanessa. I hadn't thought of that.\n\nI appreciate that they care, I really do. And I'm glad they're there for Paul. He needs people like that in his life. But sometimes I just want to scream, \"Get a grip, people! Life isn't a Hallmark movie!\"\n\nThey're good people, but they're just\u2026intense. And a little bit exhausting. Honestly, I mostly just try to avoid them. It's easier that way.\n\nDon't tell them I said that. They'd probably try to set me up with their nephew. And that would be a disaster. A total disaster.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Still bringing that up? It's been, like, years. But fine, I'll explain. It's not like I *enjoy* reliving the awkwardness.\n\nMrs. Mancini, she's\u2026intense. And she has very specific ideas about who Bleeker should be with. Basically, she thinks he deserves someone \"more stable.\" Which, okay, fair enough. I was a sixteen-year-old pregnant girl. Not exactly a picture of stability.\n\nShe also thought I was a bad influence on him. Like, I was gonna drag him down with me or something. She kept making these little comments about how I wasn't \"ambitious\" enough, or that I didn't have a \"plan\" for my future. Which, hello? I was dealing with a *baby*. A plan felt kinda far off at the time.\n\nAnd honestly, I think she just didn't understand me. I'm not exactly\u2026conventional. I say what's on my mind, I don't really care what people think, and I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor. She's more of a traditional, \"everything has to be perfect\" kind of person.\n\nIt wasn't that she didn't like *me* exactly. She just didn't think I was good enough for her precious Bleeker. It was a whole thing. A really annoying thing.\n\nEventually, she came around a little bit. After the baby was born and she saw that I actually cared about him and was trying to do the right thing. But it took a while. And a lot of awkward family dinners.\n\nHonestly, it was just a classic case of a mother not wanting her son to mess up his life with someone like me. Which, you know, fair. But also kinda rude.", "Ugh, okay, so the Mark CD. Right. That whole thing was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like I was *eager* to listen to it, okay? It wasn't like I was sitting around, all hearts and flowers, waiting for a mixtape.\n\nIt was mostly because Paul\u2026Paul was kinda pushing it. He was all, \"You should listen to it, Juno. It'll give you insight into his soul.\" Which, honestly, is a really creepy thing to say. But Paul meant well. He always tries to see the good in people.\n\nAnd I was\u2026confused. About Mark, about everything. I needed to figure out what he was thinking, what he wanted. And the CD was, like, a direct line to his brain. A really cheesy, indie-rock-filled direct line, but still.\n\nPlus, I was bored. I was sitting in my room, avoiding my dad and trying not to think about the baby, and the CD was just\u2026there. It was a distraction. A way to fill the silence.\n\nSo I put it on. And it wasn't terrible. Actually, it was kinda good. It was\u2026thoughtful. He clearly put a lot of effort into it. And it made me realize that he wasn't just some clueless guy who got me pregnant. He was\u2026a person. A flawed, awkward, but ultimately decent person.\n\nIt didn't make me fall in love with him or anything. But it made me understand him a little better. And that was enough, I guess. It was a step towards figuring things out.\n\nIt was a stupid CD, but it ended up being\u2026important. Don't tell him I said that. He'd get a big head.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Eight months. It's\u2026a lot. It's like, I went from complaining about my thighs to having a fully-formed human doing gymnastics inside me. It's weird.\n\nIt's mostly just uncomfortable, honestly. Everything is swollen. My feet look like balloons. I can't bend over without sounding like a walrus. And the heartburn? Don't even get me started. It's a constant battle with Tums.\n\nBut it's also\u2026kind of amazing. Like, I can feel him move now. Real kicks and punches. It's freaky, but also kinda cool. It's a reminder that there's a tiny person in there, and I'm responsible for him. Which is terrifying, but also\u2026good.\n\nI still have moments where I'm like, \"What have I done?\" But then I feel a kick, and I'm like, \"Okay, maybe this isn't so bad.\"\n\nPaul's being\u2026Paul. Supportive, but also kinda clueless. He keeps trying to rub my back, which is nice, but he doesn't understand that you're not supposed to rub a pregnant lady's back. It's a whole thing.\n\nAnd Annie? She's been a lifesaver. She's the one who actually knows what's going on and tells me what to expect. She's basically my pregnancy guru.\n\nSo yeah, eight months. It's exhausting, uncomfortable, and a little bit scary. But it's also\u2026real. And I guess that's what matters. It's happening. And I'm trying to be okay with that.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. I still have to maintain my cool, sarcastic exterior. It's a defense mechanism.", "Ugh, seriously? You noticed it too? It's *always* happening. Like, I'm just trying to walk down the street, minding my own business, and people are just\u2026staring. It's super annoying.\n\nI think it's a couple of things. First of all, I'm not exactly blending in, okay? I have opinions. I say what I think. I don't really do the whole \"fitting in\" thing. And I guess that's noticeable.\n\nAnd then, yeah, there's the whole\u2026situation. You know. The baby. People are probably trying to figure it out. Like, \"Is that the girl who got pregnant?\" It's rude, but it happens.\n\nI also think people are just\u2026weird. They stare at everything. Maybe they're just bored. Maybe they're judging my shoes. I don't know. I try not to think about it too much.\n\nIt's just\u2026I wish people would stop looking at me like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo. I'm just a person. A person who happens to be dealing with a lot of stuff.\n\nSo yeah, that's my theory. People stare because I'm different, and because they're nosy. And honestly? I'm over it. I just try to ignore them. It's not always easy, but it's better than letting them get to me.\n\nIt's like, if you're gonna stare, at least have something interesting to look at. Like a really good pair of boots. Or a witty t-shirt. But just staring? That's just rude.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A really weird choice.\n\nLook, Bleek is Bleek. He's sweet, I guess. And he's got that whole quiet, artistic thing going on. But Katrina De Voort? She's\u2026intense. Like, aggressively cheerful. It's kinda terrifying.\n\nI mean, good for him if he's into that. I'm not judging. Okay, maybe a little. It just feels\u2026off. Like a penguin trying to hang out with a flamingo. They're both birds, but still.\n\nI can see why he'd want to go to prom with someone. It's a big deal. But I just don't see them having a lot in common. He's all about his fantasy stuff and she's\u2026well, she's Katrina. She's into everything.\n\nIt's probably gonna be awkward. Really awkward. Lots of forced conversation and uncomfortable silences. And she's probably gonna try to get him to do some super embarrassing couple's activity.\n\nHonestly, I just hope he doesn't get completely steamrolled. He's a good kid. He deserves someone who appreciates his weirdness, not someone who tries to change it.\n\nBut hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they'll have a blast. Maybe they'll discover a hidden connection. Who knows? Life is full of surprises. Mostly bad ones, if you ask me.\n\nJust\u2026don't ask me to be a chaperone. I have better things to do. Like, avoiding my own life.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. It's\u2026a lot. Honestly, before all this happened, I thought I had things pretty figured out. Like, I knew who I was. Sarcastic, independent, liked records and vintage clothes, didn't really care what people thought. Turns out, I was mostly just avoiding thinking about anything too serious.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing? It's forced me to actually *think*. And feel. A lot.\n\nI learned I'm way more capable than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I'm 16, and I'm growing a human. That's kinda insane when you actually stop and think about it. I used to think I couldn't even handle a pop quiz, let alone a baby.\n\nI also learned that I'm not as tough as I pretend to be. I put up a good front, you know? The whole snarky, detached thing. But underneath it all, I'm actually pretty scared. And vulnerable. And I need people. Which is\u2026weird. I always thought I was good on my own.\n\nI learned that my parents, as annoying as they are sometimes, actually love me. And they're trying their best. I used to roll my eyes at everything they said, but now I realize they're just worried about me. And they're actually pretty cool, when they're not being overprotective.\n\nAnd I learned that making a big decision isn't about finding the \"right\" answer, because there isn't one. It's about choosing the best option for everyone involved, even if it's hard. And it's about being brave enough to live with the consequences.\n\nI guess\u2026I learned that I'm not just a kid anymore. I'm becoming a woman. And that's kinda terrifying. But also\u2026 kinda good. I'm still figuring things out, obviously. But I'm starting to feel like maybe, just maybe, I can handle whatever life throws at me. Even if it involves tiny humans and a whole lot of responsibility.\n\nIt's still weird, though. Really weird.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? It's just\u2026 frustrating, alright? It's like, Katrina is a genuinely sweet person. A little\u2026intense, maybe, but she's got a good heart. And Bleeker is just\u2026bleeker. He's sweet, don't get me wrong, but he's also kinda clueless. And he's leading her on!\n\nIt's not about *him* being a bad guy, it's about him not being honest with her. He's clearly not into her in *that* way, but he's letting her think he is. He's enjoying the attention, and that's just\u2026 not cool.\n\nI've been through enough emotional stuff lately to know how much it sucks to have your feelings messed with. I get it. It's awful. And Katrina doesn't deserve that. She deserves someone who appreciates her for who she is, not someone who just wants a friend with benefits or whatever he's thinking.\n\nPlus, it's just\u2026 awkward. Watching it happen. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion. And I just want to yell at him to be honest, but that's not my place, you know?\n\nIt's just\u2026 ugh. People are complicated. And sometimes, they're just really inconsiderate. And it makes me want to roll my eyes so hard they fall out of my head.\n\nIt's not my problem, technically. But I can't just sit back and watch someone get hurt, even if they're kinda weird. It's just\u2026 not right.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so like, when you're a freshman, sophomore, it seems\u2026okay. It's something to look forward to, right? Picking out a dress, maybe going with a cute guy. It's all very\u2026movie-like.\n\nBut then you actually get to be a senior. And suddenly, it's just\u2026weird. It's like everyone's trying *so hard* to have this perfect, magical night, and it just feels\u2026forced.\n\nIt's all about appearances, you know? Everyone's worried about who's going with who, who has the best dress, who's going to be crowned prom king and queen. It's like high school distilled into one really expensive, sparkly night.\n\nAnd honestly, by senior year, most people are just over it. They're thinking about college, or jobs, or just getting out of this town. Prom feels\u2026small. Like, why are we spending all this money and energy on something that's not going to matter in a few months?\n\nIt's also kinda sad, when you think about it. It's like everyone's trying to hold onto this moment, knowing it's the last time they'll all be together. It's a little bit desperate.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, if you want to go to prom, go to prom. But don't feel like you *have* to. It's not the be-all and end-all. There are way more important things in life than a dance.\n\nIt's just\u2026once you're old enough to go, you realize it's not as cool as the movies make it out to be. It's just\u2026prom. And sometimes, that's enough. But sometimes, it's just not.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one morning and was all, \u201cYep, giving the baby away!\u201d It was\u2026a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, majorly. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. I could barely keep my own life together, how was I supposed to keep another human alive?\n\nAnd then there was the whole\u2026Paul thing. He was a good guy, but he was also\u2026not ready. Neither of us were. We were kids. We were still figuring things out.\n\nMy mom was amazing, though. She didn\u2019t freak out. She just\u2026listened. And she helped me think through everything. She kept saying, \u201cYou have options, Juno. You have choices.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what it came down to, really. Choices. I could try to raise the baby myself, but that would mean giving up a lot of my dreams. College, travel, just\u2026being a kid. And I didn\u2019t want to bring a baby into a situation where I couldn\u2019t give it everything it needed.\n\nSo, I started looking into adoption. And it felt\u2026right. It felt like the best thing for the baby. To give it a life with parents who were ready and able to provide everything it needed. A stable home, financial security, a loving family.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. Finding Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were perfect. They were so kind and genuine. But saying goodbye\u2026that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like giving away a piece of myself.\n\nBut I knew it was the right thing. I knew that the baby \u2013 Henry \u2013 would be loved and cared for. And that\u2019s all that really mattered.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about me not wanting a baby. It was about wanting Henry to have the best possible life. And sometimes, the best possible life isn\u2019t with your biological mother.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? But I don\u2019t regret my decision. I really don\u2019t. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, but it was also the most selfless. And I think\u2026I think that\u2019s okay.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. It's not a happy story, exactly. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so Dad being Dad. It's\u2026complicated. Like, I get it, he's worried. He always worries. It's his thing. But honestly, the whole \"getting ripped off\" thing felt kinda insulting. Like, I'm not an idiot. And Mark and Vanessa aren't villains in a movie.\n\nIt's not like I'm selling a used car here. I'm giving a baby a life. A good life. And they seemed genuinely excited and\u2026nice. Like, actually nice. Not \"nice\" in a creepy, Stepford Wives kind of way.\n\nBut Dad, he's all about protecting me. Which is sweet, I guess. But it felt like he didn't trust my judgment. Like he thought I'd just pick the first couple who offered me a free lifetime supply of pizza or something.\n\nAnd it's not about the money, okay? It's about finding someone who will love this kid and give them everything they need. And Mark and Vanessa seemed like they could do that.\n\nI told him, \"Dad, I'm not stupid. I'm not just handing my baby over to anyone.\" But he still had this look on his face, like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nIt just made me feel\u2026responsible. Like I had to prove to him that I was making the right decision. And that's a lot of pressure, you know? Especially when you're already dealing with, like, everything else.\n\nSo yeah, I appreciate his concern, I really do. But sometimes, he just needs to chill. I can handle this. I'm not a little kid anymore. I'm making a grown-up decision, and I'm doing it for the right reasons. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Seriously? *That's* what he goes with? After everything? It's just\u2026classic Dad. Always with the subtle digs disguised as \"concern.\"\n\nIt's like, okay, yeah, maybe I do have a tendency to, like, overshare or get myself into situations. But who doesn't when they're seventeen and figuring things out? And especially when their life has been turned upside down?\n\nHe thinks it's about the pregnancy, doesn't he? He thinks I'm being reckless or irresponsible. But it's not just about that. It's about everything. It's about me trying to be a person, trying to figure out who I am, and him always trying to control the narrative.\n\n\"Not knowing when to say when.\" It's so condescending. Like I'm a little kid who doesn't understand boundaries. I'm making a huge decision, a really difficult one, and I'm doing it with a lot more thought and maturity than he gives me credit for.\n\nHonestly, it just makes me want to dig my heels in even further. It makes me want to prove him wrong. It makes me want to do exactly what I want to do, just to spite him.\n\nBut then I remember that he's just\u2026scared. He's scared for me, and he doesn't know how to deal with it. He's not good with feelings. So he resorts to passive-aggressive comments.\n\nIt still stings, though. It always does. It's just\u2026ugh. My dad. He's a good guy, deep down. He just has a really weird way of showing it.\n\nI probably just rolled my eyes and mumbled something sarcastic under my breath. That's usually my go-to response. It's easier than actually having a conversation with him.", "Ugh, Loring. Seriously? That place is\u2026a lot. It's like Stepford Wives meets a golf course. All perfectly manicured lawns and people pretending everything is perfect. It's aggressively\u2026pleasant. And that's what makes it creepy.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against people having money, okay? It's just\u2026the *show* of it. The gates, the security guards, the matching houses\u2026it's like they're trying to build a bubble around themselves and pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist.\n\nAnd the people! They're all so\u2026concerned. Concerned about property values, concerned about appearances, concerned about what everyone else is doing. It's exhausting just being around them. They're always asking how things are going with the baby, and it's not like they actually *care*, you know? It's more like they're checking to make sure I'm still \"appropriate\" for their community.\n\nIt feels\u2026artificial. Like everything is fake and carefully constructed. It's the opposite of real life. And I'm not really into fake.\n\nPaul's parents seem happy there, I guess. They like the safety and the quiet. But it's just not my vibe. I need a little bit of chaos, a little bit of grit. I need to be around people who are actually, you know, *real*.\n\nIt's a nice place, objectively. But it's just\u2026not me. It feels like I'd suffocate in there. Like I'd lose myself trying to fit in. And I'm already trying to figure out who I am, I don't need to add \"perfect Loring resident\" to the list.\n\nSo yeah. Loring. It's\u2026fine. Just not for me.", "Ugh, Vanessa Loring. Okay, so, first impressions? She was\u2026intense. Like, *really* put together. Always perfectly accessorized, always knowing exactly what to say. It was kinda intimidating, honestly. I'm used to people who are a little more\u2026messy. Like me.\n\nShe seemed really serious about the whole adoption thing, which was good, I guess. But also a little\u2026clinical? Like she was picking out a new sofa instead of a baby. Not that she didn't seem nice, just\u2026polished.\n\nAnd she and Mark were, like, *perfect*. You know? The perfect couple, the perfect house, the perfect life. It made me feel even more awkward and\u2026unprepared. Like I was crashing their perfectly curated world.\n\nI think I was mostly just suspicious. I mean, nobody is *that* perfect, right? I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. I figured there had to be some hidden agenda, some secret reason why they were so eager to adopt.\n\nIt took me a while to realize she was just\u2026nervous. And trying to control everything because she was scared. But yeah, initial impressions? Polished, intense, and a little bit scary. Definitely not what I expected. It was like meeting a Stepford wife, but, like, a really nice Stepford wife.", "Ugh. Okay, so Bleeker offering to carry my backpack? That was\u2026a moment. A weird moment.\n\nHonestly? It was kinda sweet. I mean, Bleeker is\u2026Bleeker. He's not exactly known for his physical prowess, okay? He's more of a quiet, music-obsessed kind of guy. So the fact that he even *offered* to carry something heavy was surprising.\n\nAt first, I was just suspicious. Like, what's the angle? Is he trying to get something out of me? Is this some elaborate attempt to prove he's not a total dork? Because, let's be real, he's a dork. A lovable dork, but still.\n\nBut then I looked at his face, and he was just\u2026being nice. Like, genuinely trying to help. And my backpack *was* ridiculously heavy. Full of textbooks and, like, my entire emotional baggage.\n\nSo I let him. And it was\u2026nice. It was a small gesture, but it felt\u2026significant. It was like he was saying, \"Hey, I see you. I see you're struggling. And I want to help.\"\n\nIt didn't suddenly make me fall madly in love with him or anything. But it definitely made me see him in a different light. It made me realize that he was a good person, even if he was a little bit awkward.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a relief to not have to carry that stupid backpack for another minute. So yeah, I appreciated it. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about that comic? It's kinda embarrassing to even *think* about, let alone talk about. But fine. I'll explain.\n\nIt wasn't about the comic being, like, objectively *good*. It was\u2026the honesty of it. Yuki, she wasn't trying to be cool or popular or anything. She was just\u2026herself. And she was okay with that. She was drawing these super personal, kinda weird comics about her life, and she didn't care what anyone thought.\n\nAnd I realized\u2026I was spending so much time worrying about what other people thought of *me*. About being a \"fat dork,\" as you so eloquently put it. About fitting in. About being normal. And it was exhausting.\n\nYuki just\u2026didn't seem to care. She was just creating. And it was freeing. It made me realize that maybe I didn't *need* to be normal. Maybe it was okay to be weird. Maybe it was okay to be me.\n\nIt wasn't like, suddenly I wasn't self-conscious anymore. But it was a little crack in the wall of insecurity. A little reminder that it's okay to be different. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just be yourself, even if that self is a little bit dorky.\n\nIt was a weird epiphany, okay? Don't judge. It's not like I went out and started drawing comics or anything. But it definitely made me feel\u2026less like a dork. And more like\u2026Juno. Which, I guess, is a good thing.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That guy. Mark. He's\u2026a lot. And honestly, the whole superhero comparison was just\u2026weird.\n\nBut, okay, if I *have* to analyze it, which is what I do, right? Overthink everything. I guess he meant it as a compliment? Like, the comic book character, she was, like, unexpectedly powerful, right? And she was dealing with a huge responsibility, even though she wasn't looking for it.\n\nAnd yeah, I guess that's kinda me. I wasn't planning on being pregnant. It was\u2026a surprise. A big one. And now I have to figure out what to do with it. It's not exactly saving the world, but it feels pretty important.\n\nHe probably thought it was a cute way to say I was strong. Which is\u2026fine. I guess. But it also felt kinda dismissive, you know? Like he was reducing my whole situation to a comic book trope. Like he didn't really *get* it.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm not a superhero. I'm just a regular girl who made a mistake. A big, life-altering mistake. And I'm trying to do the right thing. That doesn't make me superpowered. It just makes me\u2026responsible.\n\nSo yeah, he compared me to a pregnant superhero. It was awkward. And kinda sweet. And mostly just\u2026Mark being Mark. He means well, I guess. He just doesn't always think things through.\n\nUgh. I need a burger.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. And kinda raw, honestly. People keep asking me about adoption, like it's some kinda easy decision. It's not. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to think about.\n\nSo, open adoption. Yeah. I get the idea. Keeping a connection, letting the kid know where they came from, all that. It sounds\u2026nice. In theory. But for me? It just felt\u2026messy. Like, a constant reminder of everything I couldn't give this kid.\n\nSee, I already feel like a screw-up. I'm sixteen. I still eat cereal for dinner sometimes. I'm not exactly equipped to co-parent with someone, especially not someone I barely know. It's not about the birth parents being bad people, it's about *me*. I need to be able to move on, to build a life, without constantly wondering what's going on with this kid.\n\nI need closure. I need to know that I did the best thing for them, and then I need to be able to let go. An open adoption just feels like\u2026never really letting go. Like a permanent tether.\n\nAnd honestly? It feels kinda selfish. Like the birth parents are getting to keep a piece of the kid, even after they've given them up. I want this kid to have a family that's completely and totally theirs, without any lingering connections to their birth mom.\n\nI know people say it's better for the kid to know their history, and maybe it is. But I also think it's important for the kid to have a sense of stability and belonging. And I just didn't think an open adoption could provide that.\n\nSo, yeah. I prefer a traditional, closed adoption. It's not perfect. It's heartbreaking. But it feels like the cleanest break. It feels like the best way to give this kid a chance at a normal life.\n\nIt's not a judgment on anyone else's choices. It's just what I need. It's what I can handle. And honestly? It's what feels right for me. It's just\u2026really hard to explain. It's a lot of feelings, all tangled up.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about it a million times.\n\nHonestly, before all this pregnancy stuff happened, I was just\u2026 coasting. I was good at being sarcastic, good at avoiding things, good at just generally being\u2026invisible. I didn't really *think* about who I was, or what I wanted. I just kinda existed.\n\nBut then, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, I had to make a decision. A really big decision. And it wasn't about what my parents wanted, or what Paul wanted, or what anyone else thought. It was about what *I* wanted.\n\nAnd that was terrifying.\n\nBut going through it, talking to Vanessa and Mark, and even dealing with Paul's\u2026well, Paul-ness\u2026it forced me to actually look inside myself. I realized I wasn't just some cynical teenager. I was capable of making a really selfless decision, even if it was hard.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby the best life possible. And that took strength. A different kind of strength than I thought I had.\n\nAnd then, just\u2026growing up. Dealing with the awkwardness, the judgment, the responsibility\u2026it all chipped away at the layers of sarcasm and cynicism. I started to see things more clearly. I started to understand that it's okay to be vulnerable, it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nI think, by the end of it, I realized that my identity wasn't something I had to *find*. It was something I was *creating*. It was about the choices I made, the people I cared about, and the kind of person I wanted to be.\n\nIt wasn't about being cool or popular or fitting in. It was about being\u2026me. And that's a pretty good feeling. Even if it's still a work in progress.\n\nSo yeah, the whole pregnancy thing was a mess. But it also kinda\u2026saved me. It forced me to grow up, to face my fears, and to find my own voice. And that's something I'll always be grateful for. Even if I still roll my eyes a lot.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about *that*? It's been, like, forever. But fine. I guess it's a good story.\n\nIt was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes. Yeah, I know, super clich\u00e9. But it just\u2026fit. It was kinda dorky and sweet and a little bit sad, which, honestly, was pretty much my whole vibe at the time.\n\nMark picked it. He said it reminded him of me. Which, I guess, was a compliment? I don't know. He was always good at saying the right things.\n\nThe dance itself was\u2026awkward. I'm not a graceful dancer, okay? And Mark wasn't exactly Fred Astaire. We mostly just kinda swayed and tried not to step on each other's feet. But it was okay. It was\u2026nice.\n\nIt's funny, thinking about it now. All that drama with Paulie Bleeker and the baby and everything, and there I was, slow dancing with Mark at his senior prom to a song about new beginnings. Life is weird.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said it was nice, though. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be sarcastic and cynical, not all mushy and sentimental. But yeah. \"First Day of My Life.\" That was the song.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People keep asking me about that. It's not like I *wanted* Mark and Vanessa to stay together, okay? It wasn't about them. It was about the baby.\n\nLook, Mark was a good guy. A really good guy. And he was totally willing to step up and raise the baby himself. But he was\u2026a mess. He was still figuring things out, still kinda lost. And honestly, he wasn't ready for the responsibility of raising a kid on his own. He needed support.\n\nVanessa, she wasn't perfect, obviously. She was kinda uptight and\u2026well, Vanessa. But she was stable. She had a good life, a good home, and she was genuinely excited about the idea of being a mom. She could give the baby everything it needed.\n\nAnd Mark knew that. He knew he couldn't give the baby that on his own. He loved me, yeah, but he loved that baby more. And he knew what was best for it.\n\nIt wasn't about saving their marriage. It was about giving that baby the best possible life. And that meant keeping the family together, even if it wasn't the family I originally imagined.\n\nIt was a hard decision, okay? It wasn't easy. But it was the right one. And I had to trust that. I had to trust that they could give that baby a better life than I could. And I had to trust that Mark would be a good dad, even if he wasn't raising the baby on his own.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And sometimes, that means making sacrifices. Even if it breaks your heart a little.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with that. It still kinda stings, honestly. Even now.\n\nIt wasn't like...shocking, exactly. I mean, he was Mark. He was, like, permanently stuck in arrested development. But it was still\u2026a punch to the gut. I'd spent so much time trying to figure out what *I* wanted, and I thought, maybe, just maybe, he wanted something similar. A family, or at least, a plan.\n\nIt wasn't about him not loving me, I knew that. It was about him not being able to handle responsibility. Which, fine. Whatever. But it made me feel\u2026small. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like this whole thing was just about him and his band and his life, and I was just\u2026an obstacle.\n\nI tried to be cool about it, you know? Sarcastic. Dismissive. Like it didn't bother me. But inside, I was a mess. I was already dealing with everything else \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption, my parents \u2013 and then to have him just\u2026bail? It was a lot.\n\nIt made me realize I didn't need him. I didn't need a boyfriend who couldn't step up. I needed someone who was supportive and reliable, and he clearly wasn't that person.\n\nIt sucked, though. It really did. It would have been nice to have someone to share it with. But I figured it out. I always do. And honestly? I think I'm better off without him. He's a good guy, but he's just\u2026not ready. And that's okay. I guess.\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's fine. I'm fine. I just\u2026needed to get that off my chest. It's been a while.", "Ugh, okay, so Mark. Yeah. That was\u2026something. People always ask about that. Like it was some big mystery why I didn't just run screaming in the other direction.\n\nHonestly? It was a relief. Everyone else at school was so\u2026predictable. All the drama and the cliques and the trying-too-hard. Mark wasn't any of that. He was just\u2026Mark. Quiet, a little awkward, obsessed with music and superheroes. He didn't care what people thought of him, and that was kinda refreshing.\n\nHe didn't try to impress me or anything. He just\u2026was. And he listened. Like, *really* listened. Not just waiting for his turn to talk. He actually seemed interested in what I had to say, even when I was being sarcastic or cynical. Which, let's be real, is most of the time.\n\nAnd yeah, his life was weird. The whole Bleeker thing, the band practice in the garage, the general air of artistic chaos\u2026it was different. But it was a good different. It was real. It wasn't fake or manufactured.\n\nI think I liked that he saw me, you know? Not just the pregnant teenager, but\u2026me. The girl who liked music and movies and making sarcastic comments. He didn't judge me for my situation. He just accepted me for who I was.\n\nPlus, he was funny. In a quiet, understated way. And he made me laugh. A lot. And when you're dealing with something as huge and scary as being pregnant, you need all the laughter you can get.\n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of his weird life. It was a good distraction. It was a safe space. And he was a good friend. A really good friend. Even if he did have questionable taste in music sometimes. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, Mark. That's\u2026complicated. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a little bit of a man-child. But becoming a dad? That's a whole other level of cluelessness, I think.\n\nHonestly? I bet he's mostly terrified. Like, genuinely, pants-wettingly scared. He's still figuring out how to be a functional adult, and now someone's handing him a tiny human being that depends on him for *everything*? Yeah, no.\n\nI think he's trying to be supportive, you know? He's saying all the right things, offering to help, pretending he's not completely overwhelmed. But underneath all that, I bet he's having a full-blown panic attack every time he thinks about it.\n\nHe probably pictures himself dropping the baby, or forgetting to feed it, or accidentally teaching it to say something really inappropriate. He's a worrier, that one.\n\nBut\u2026he also wants to do the right thing. He's a good person, and he genuinely cares about me. I think he's trying to wrap his head around the idea that this isn't just about me anymore. It's about creating a good life for this kid, even if he's not raising it himself.\n\nHe's probably also secretly hoping I'll change my mind, but he's too polite to say anything. He's just\u2026processing. And probably Googling \"how to change a diaper\" a lot.\n\nIt's gonna be a learning experience for both of us, that's for sure. And I have a feeling it's gonna be a really messy one. But I think, deep down, he'll step up. He's Mark. He's a little bit of a goofball, but he's got a good heart. And that's what matters, right?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a *moment*, alright? A moment of weakness. A moment of\u2026teenage angst.\n\nLook, it wasn't about the perfume itself. It was about\u2026everything. Paul and I were having a really awkward conversation, okay? About, like, feelings and responsibility and the whole baby situation. It was a lot. And I was feeling super overwhelmed and vulnerable.\n\nAnd then I went into Loring's bathroom, and there it was. That perfume. It smelled\u2026expensive. And sophisticated. And everything I wasn't feeling at that moment. It was like a little symbol of everything I was missing out on.\n\nI know, it was stupid. It was impulsive. It was totally wrong. But in that moment, it felt like\u2026taking something for myself. Like reclaiming a little bit of control. Like saying, \"I deserve something nice, even if I'm a mess.\"\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to *keep* the perfume. It was about the act of taking it. It was a stupid, reckless, teenage thing to do. And I totally regretted it afterwards.\n\nHonestly, it was a really dumb move. And I'm glad I eventually returned it. But yeah, that's the story. It wasn't about the scent, it was about the feeling. And the feeling was\u2026complicated.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? I was going through a lot.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? That whole Mark and Vanessa situation is a mess. It's like, a slow-motion train wreck you can't look away from. And honestly? It's kinda sad.\n\nI've been observing them, you know? From a distance, obviously. I'm not *trying* to eavesdrop, but it's hard not to when they're yelling in the kitchen.\n\nI think\u2026I think Mark just wants something *different*. Vanessa is\u2026intense. She has a very specific vision for her life, and she expects everyone to fit into it. And Mark? He's just\u2026chill. He likes things easy. He likes to go with the flow.\n\nIt's like she's constantly trying to *fix* him, you know? Like he's a project. And he just wants to be accepted for who he is. He wants someone who'll watch a bad movie with him and eat pizza without judging.\n\nAnd she's always talking about appearances. The house, the garden, the perfect family image. It's exhausting just listening to her. I think Mark just got tired of trying to live up to her expectations.\n\nHe's not a bad guy, Mark. He's just\u2026lost. And I think he's realized that he and Vanessa are just fundamentally different people. They want different things. And sometimes, even if you love someone, that's just not enough.\n\nIt's a bummer, though. It really is. Divorce is never easy. But I think, for Mark, it's about finding someone who lets him breathe. Someone who doesn't try to change him. Someone who just\u2026gets him.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes, people just grow apart. It doesn't mean anyone's a villain. It just means they're not right for each other anymore.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the awkward stuff, huh? Fine. Look, it wasn't about *Vanessa* exactly. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nShe was being nice, which is always suspicious. And she was asking what was wrong like she actually cared, which, no offense to Vanessa, felt kinda weird. I mean, she's Paul's mom. And Paul and I were\u2026complicated.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want to talk to her. It was that I didn't want to *explain* anything. Explaining things is exhausting. And honestly, I wasn't ready to admit to *anyone* \u2013 not even myself \u2013 how freaked out I was about everything.\n\nI was already feeling super vulnerable, you know? Like a raw nerve. And Vanessa asking me what was wrong felt like she was poking at it. \n\nPlus, I just wanted to get out of there. The whole situation with Paul was getting too intense. I needed space. I needed to breathe. I needed to go find a good diner and eat a lot of pancakes.\n\nSo yeah, I rushed out. It was a bad move, I know. But sometimes, you just gotta run. It's a survival mechanism. Don't judge. It's hard being sixteen and pregnant and trying to figure out your life. Okay?", "Ugh. Vanessa. She's\u2026optimistic. To a fault. Like, seriously, the woman needs a reality check.\n\nLook, I get it. She loves Mark. And she wants this to work. She wants the whole picket fence, 2.5 kids, golden retriever thing. But Mark? He's\u2026Mark. He's still figuring out how to load the dishwasher, let alone raise a human being.\n\nHonestly, believing he's gonna magically transform into responsible-dad material is just setting herself up for heartbreak. It's like waiting for a bus that's never gonna come. You're just gonna stand there, getting colder and colder, while everyone else moves on.\n\nI mean, he barely even *noticed* I was pregnant at first! He was too busy making mix CDs and being generally\u2026Mark-ish. And that's fine, for a friend. But a father? That requires a whole different level of commitment.\n\nVanessa's a good person. She deserves someone who's excited about the idea of being a dad, not someone who's gonna need a manual and a lot of therapy. \n\nI'm not saying she should give up on him completely. But she needs to be realistic. And she needs to start thinking about what *she* wants, not just what she thinks Mark might eventually want. Because waiting around for him to \"come around\" is just a waste of her time. And honestly? It's kinda sad.\n\nShe needs to realize she deserves better. And maybe, just maybe, find someone who's actually ready to be a dad. It's not too much to ask, is it?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *music*? Like I don't have enough going on? But fine. It's a good distraction, I guess.\n\nMy favorite genre? It's gotta be indie rock. Specifically, the kinda stuff that sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement. Like, The Moldy Peaches, obviously. They're the best.\n\nIt's not all sunshine and rainbows, okay? It's kinda\u2026messy. And real. It's not trying to be perfect or polished or anything. It's just\u2026honest. And a little bit sad. Which, let's be real, is how I feel most of the time.\n\nIt's the kind of music you can listen to when you're feeling totally overwhelmed and just need to, like, wallow for a bit. But it's also kinda hopeful, in a weird way. It makes you feel like you're not alone in being a total mess.\n\nPlus, the lyrics are usually pretty smart. And sarcastic. Which I appreciate.\n\nIt's just\u2026it gets me, you know? It understands. It doesn't judge. It just *is*. And sometimes, that's exactly what you need.\n\nDon't even get me started on pop music. It's all just\u2026manufactured happiness. Give me something real, something raw, something with a little bit of edge. That's what I'm talking about.\n\nSo yeah. Indie rock. Don't judge me. It's my coping mechanism.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know my feelings on pilates and exercise? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my athletic prowess, okay? I prefer a good movie and a bag of chips to, like, running a marathon. But, um, things have been\u2026different lately. You know. With the baby and everything.\n\nSo, pilates. It's\u2026surprisingly okay. I tried it with Paul, and it wasn't as torture-y as I expected. It's kinda good for, like, core strength, which I guess is important for\u2026well, you know. The whole baby-pushing thing. It's not exactly *fun*, but it doesn't make me want to punch anyone, which is a plus.\n\nExercising in general? I'm still trying to figure that out. I mean, I get that it's good for you. And I'm trying to be a responsible adult and all that. But it's hard to motivate myself when there are so many other things I'd rather be doing. Like, perfecting my sarcastic wit or watching old movies.\n\nI think the key is finding something you don't completely hate. Something that doesn't feel like a punishment. Maybe walking? Or dancing? I don't know. I'm still experimenting.\n\nIt's just\u2026I'm not one of those people who gets, like, a rush of endorphins from working out. I get a rush of endorphins from eating a really good donut. Which, admittedly, is probably not the healthiest approach.\n\nBut hey, I'm trying. And that's gotta count for something, right? Don't judge me. I'm pregnant. I'm allowed to be a little bit lazy.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, the guitar thing\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It\u2019s more\u2026 awkward. And revealing.\n\nSee, I\u2019m not exactly known for being vulnerable. I build walls. It\u2019s a survival mechanism, okay? But when I\u2019m playing guitar with Mark, those walls kinda\u2026 crumble. It\u2019s stupid, I know. It\u2019s just a guitar. But it feels\u2026safe. Like, I can actually *be* myself, instead of the sarcastic, cynical Juno everyone\u2019s used to.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t push me to talk about stuff, which is good. He just\u2026 listens. And plays. And sometimes, he\u2019ll write a little riff that perfectly captures how I\u2019m feeling, even when I can\u2019t put it into words. It\u2019s kinda freaky how he does that.\n\nBut it also makes me nervous. Because when I\u2019m being vulnerable, I\u2019m also being\u2026 exposed. And that\u2019s scary. I worry that he\u2019ll see all my flaws and decide I\u2019m not worth the effort. Or worse, that he\u2019ll try to \u201cfix\u201d me.\n\nSo, I tend to pull away after those moments. I\u2019ll make a sarcastic comment or change the subject. It\u2019s my way of protecting myself. It\u2019s a messed up cycle, I know.\n\nIt definitely complicates things. It makes me realize that I *do* want a connection with him, a real connection. But it also makes me afraid of getting hurt. It\u2019s like, the guitar shows me what could be, and then I immediately sabotage it because I\u2019m terrified of actually letting myself feel something.\n\nIt\u2019s a work in progress, okay? I\u2019m still figuring it out. And honestly, it\u2019s probably the most confusing part of the whole thing. It\u2019s just\u2026 music makes everything messier. And more real.", "Ugh, okay, so music. It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, seriously. It's the only thing that can cut through all the noise in my head, you know? All the worrying and the awkwardness and the just\u2026*stuff*.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, it was like someone hit the pause button on my life. Everything felt weird and overwhelming. And music was the one thing that still felt\u2026normal. It was a constant.\n\nI have playlists for everything. Like, a \"Panic Attack\" playlist with a lot of The Smiths and stuff. Really angsty. And a \"Trying to Be Mature\" playlist with more mellow stuff, like Regina Spektor. And a \"Just Wanna Hide Under the Covers\" playlist that's mostly Sufjan Stevens.\n\nIt helps me process things, I guess. Like, when I'm feeling super freaked out about the whole baby thing, I'll listen to something sad and just let myself cry. It's kinda cathartic. And when I'm feeling annoyed with Paul or my dad, I'll listen to something loud and angry and it makes me feel better.\n\nBut it's not just about the lyrics. It's about the *feeling* of the music. It can make me feel calm, or energized, or just\u2026less alone. It's like having a friend who understands what you're going through, even if they don't say anything.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches are a big one. They're just so honest and weird and real. They don't try to be anything they're not. And that's kinda how I'm trying to be, too. Just\u2026me. Even if \"me\" is a pregnant teenager who's kinda freaking out.\n\nSo yeah, music. It's a lifesaver. It's my escape, my comfort, my way of making sense of everything. It's the soundtrack to my life, and right now, it's a pretty complicated soundtrack. But it's *my* soundtrack. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026complicated. And honestly, still kinda stings to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about *them*, not really. It was about me. I was a mess, okay? Everything was happening so fast. I was pregnant, I was trying to figure out what I wanted, and suddenly Vanessa and Mark were\u2026intense. Like, *really* intense.\n\nThey were so eager to be parents, so ready to just\u2026take over. And I appreciated it, I really did. They were amazing. But it felt like they were already planning my life, planning the baby's life, and I hadn't even had a chance to process any of it myself.\n\nI felt suffocated. Like I was losing control. And I'm not good with losing control. I need to be the one making the decisions, even if they're bad decisions.\n\nRunning away was stupid, I know. It was selfish. But I needed space. I needed to breathe. I needed to figure out what *I* wanted, not what everyone else thought I should want.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want them in my life. It was that I needed to find myself first. I needed to be Juno, not just a vessel for a baby.\n\nI messed up, big time. And I hurt them. And I felt terrible about it. But I had to do what I had to do, you know? Even if it was the wrong thing.\n\nIt took me a while to realize that, but eventually, I did. And I apologized. And we worked things out. But yeah\u2026that was a rough patch. A really rough patch.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026not a good moment.\n\nOkay, so, the conflict with Mark and Vanessa\u2026it wasn't just about the ad, you know? It was about everything. It was about feeling like I was messing up this whole baby thing, like I wasn't mature enough to make a good decision. It was about being scared, and feeling totally alone.\n\nAnd then Vanessa just\u2026laid it all out there. About how Mark was really into me, and how she was worried about him being hurt. And it wasn't that I didn't *care* about Mark, it was just\u2026it wasn't the right kind of care. It was complicated.\n\nWhen I was in the car, just\u2026falling apart? It wasn't just sadness. It was relief, too. Relief that it was over. Relief that I didn't have to pretend anymore. But mostly, it was just\u2026overwhelming. Like all the emotions I'd been stuffing down for weeks just exploded.\n\nI felt stupid, and vulnerable, and really, really scared about the future. I was supposed to be this strong, independent person, and I was just a mess in a parking lot.\n\nIt was the kind of crying where your chest hurts and you can't breathe. The kind of crying where you feel like you're breaking into a million pieces.\n\nI don't really like talking about it, honestly. It was a really raw and messy time. But\u2026it was also kind of necessary. I needed to feel all those feelings, to process everything. It helped me figure out what I really wanted, and what I needed to do.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. A lot. But it was also\u2026a turning point.", "Ugh, okay, you want to bring *that* up? Fine. It's a good story, I guess. A little embarrassing, but whatever.\n\nSo, Paul took me to Jiffy Lube because my car was making this weird noise, right? And I was just\u2026feeling really overwhelmed. Everything was happening so fast with the baby and Mark and everything. I just needed to say *something*.\n\nAnd I saw that Jiffy Lube receipt, and it was just\u2026perfect. It was all official and business-y, and it had that little space at the bottom for a signature. So I wrote:\n\n**\"I am pregnant. Please be kind. - Juno MacGuff\"**\n\nWhy? Because I figured if anyone was going to be non-judgmental, it would be the guys at Jiffy Lube. They see everything. They've seen it all. And I just wanted to put it out there, you know? Like, \"Hey, world, I'm dealing with something big here. Cut me some slack.\"\n\nIt was a weird impulse, I admit. But it felt right at the time. And it actually worked! Paul thought it was hilarious, and he was really supportive. And I didn't get any weird looks from the Jiffy Lube guys. They just changed my oil and wished me well.\n\nIt was a small act of defiance, I guess. A way of taking control of the situation, even if it was just by writing a message on a greasy receipt. It was my way of saying, \"I'm here, I'm pregnant, and I'm not ashamed.\"\n\nDon't judge me, okay? It was a stressful time. And sometimes, you just gotta do what you gotta do. Even if it involves a Jiffy Lube receipt.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Honestly? A lot of things. Mostly just a giant, swirling mess of \"Oh. My. God. This is going horribly wrong.\"\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026intense. Paul had warned me. But I didn't realize it was *that* intense. I thought she'd be, like, sad. Maybe a little disappointed. Not\u2026completely fall apart.\n\nWhen she started crying, I just froze. I felt terrible. Like, I'd punched a puppy or something. It wasn't my intention to hurt her, you know? I just wanted her to know what was going on. I wanted to be honest.\n\nAnd then I started second-guessing everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Should I have just kept my mouth shut?\n\nBut then I also felt\u2026a little bit angry. Like, she had no right to freak out like that. It wasn't my fault she and Mark were having problems. It wasn't my fault she was so desperate for a baby.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really complicated moment. I felt bad for her, I felt bad for Mark, I felt bad for the baby, and I felt bad for myself. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nMostly, I just wanted to rewind time and handle it differently. But you can't, right? You just have to deal with the fallout. And try not to make things worse.\n\nIt was a really messy situation. And honestly, it still makes me cringe when I think about it. It was a good reminder that even when you're trying to do the right thing, things can still go spectacularly wrong.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment with Vanessa\u2026 that was rough. It wasn\u2019t the *asking* exactly, it was the way she asked. Like she was already mourning a kid that wasn\u2019t even born yet. And honestly, it made me feel\u2026small.\n\nIt was like she was trying to guilt me, you know? Like I was doing something wrong by *not* wanting to raise the baby myself. And I get it, she and Mark really wanted a kid. They were good people. But it wasn\u2019t my kid. Not in the way they wanted it to be.\n\nI think I just\u2026froze. I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, but I also didn\u2019t want to back down. It was my decision, and I\u2019d thought about it a lot. It wasn\u2019t a flippant thing.\n\nI think I said something sarcastic, probably. I do that when I\u2019m uncomfortable. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. Something about how I wasn\u2019t exactly equipped to handle a tiny human.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I was just\u2026sad. Sad for her, sad for Mark, and honestly, a little bit sad for myself. It was a complicated feeling. It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t care. I just knew I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t the right person to give that baby what it needed.\n\nIt made me realize how much they wanted it, and how much it meant to them. And that made me feel even more responsible for making the right decision. It wasn\u2019t about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby. And for them.\n\nIt was a really heavy moment. And it made me realize that even though I was choosing to give the baby up, it didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t care. It just meant I was choosing to give it a life I couldn\u2019t provide. And that\u2019s\u2026a hard thing to explain.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay. That guy. Honestly, I wanted to punch him. Not, like, *actually* punch him, because violence isn't the answer, even when someone's being a total jerk. But I wanted to. Badly.\n\nIt was\u2026awful. I mean, I was already a mess, okay? Dealing with the whole unplanned pregnancy thing, trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life, and then *that* happens.\n\nIt wasn't just that he brought it up in front of everyone, which was mortifying enough. It was the implication. The suggestion that Bleeker, sweet, awkward Bleeker, might be the father. It was just\u2026wrong.\n\nI could feel my face getting all hot and my hands were probably shaking. I tried to play it cool, you know? Like, \"Oh, Vijay, you're hilarious.\" But inside, I was just screaming.\n\nIt made me feel so vulnerable and exposed. Like everyone was looking at me, judging me. And it made me feel protective of Bleeker, because he didn't deserve that. He was being so supportive and sweet, and Vijay just had to ruin it.\n\nI think that was the moment I realized how much I actually cared about Bleeker. Not in a \"we're going to be a family\" kind of way, but in a \"I want to protect this good person from awful people\" kind of way.\n\nIt was a really crappy moment. And honestly, I still get annoyed just thinking about it. Vijay could have kept his mouth shut. He really could have.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay and his whole\u2026journey. It was\u2026a lot. A *lot* of beard oil, a lot of brooding, and a whole lot of questionable life choices.\n\nHonestly? My first reaction was just\u2026eye-rolling. Like, hard. I mean, a mustache? To prove you're a \"real man\"? That's the dumbest thing I've heard since Paul decided he was going to be a graphic novelist.\n\nI think I said something like, \"So, growing facial hair is now the benchmark for masculinity? That's\u2026new.\" And then I probably made a sarcastic comment about how he looked like a creepy Victorian villain.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I was actually kinda sad for him. He was so lost, you know? Trying to figure out who he was, what he wanted. And he thought a mustache was the answer? It was just\u2026pathetic.\n\nI mean, I get wanting to define yourself. I was dealing with that whole thing myself, obviously. But a mustache? That's just\u2026superficial. \n\nI think I eventually told him that being a \"real man\" wasn't about how you looked, it was about how you treated people. And that he was already a good person, mustache or no mustache. \n\nHe didn't really get it at first. He was too caught up in his own head. But eventually, he came around. He shaved the mustache, and he started to focus on things that actually mattered. \n\nIt was a weird chapter, though. A really weird chapter. And honestly, I'm still not sure I fully understand it. But hey, people are complicated. And Vijay\u2026Vijay was definitely complicated.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing that up? Okay, fine. It's been a while, but I remember. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nThe note Vanessa found in the kitchen? That was for Paul. It was a list of things I needed him to do while I was at the hospital getting the ultrasound. Like, really specific things. You know, the kind of things a pregnant girl needs.\n\nIt wasn't a love letter or anything. It was more like a\u2026task list. A very detailed task list. It had stuff like \"Buy pickles and ice cream (don't judge)\" and \"Watch 'Rocky' and be inspired\" and \"Don't tell anyone about the baby, especially your mom.\"\n\nI was trying to be all responsible and organized, you know? Like, I had this whole plan for how things were going to go. And I wanted to make sure Paul was on board.\n\nBut Vanessa totally misinterpreted it. She thought it was some kind of secret message, like we were having a secret affair or something. It was mortifying.\n\nHonestly, it just showed how little she understood about me and Paul. We weren't about grand gestures or secret messages. We were about awkward silences and shared snacks and just\u2026being there for each other.\n\nIt was a dumb note. But it ended up being a pretty big deal. It kinda forced us to talk about things, which was good, I guess. Even if it was super embarrassing at the time.\n\nUgh. Don't remind me. It was a whole thing.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about the whole Mark and Vanessa thing? Yeah, that was\u2026complicated. It wasn't just about them staying together, it was about *why* they were staying together.\n\nSee, everyone kept saying how \"perfect\" they were for each other, how they were \"meant to be.\" But they were also, like, totally miserable. They were polite miserable, sure, but still. And everyone was pressuring them to stay together for the baby, for appearances, for whatever.\n\nI was worried that they were going to stay together for the *wrong* reasons. That they were going to build a whole life based on obligation instead of actual love. And that's not fair to anyone, especially not the kid.\n\nI mean, I get wanting to be a \"normal\" family. But normal doesn't always equal happy. And a kid deserves parents who actually *want* to be with each other, not just parents who feel like they *should* be.\n\nIt was just\u2026 frustrating. Everyone was so focused on what looked good on paper, they weren't seeing what was actually happening. And I didn't want the baby to grow up in a house full of quiet resentment.\n\nSo yeah, I was concerned about them staying together. Not because I didn't want them to be a family, but because I wanted them to be a *happy* family. And sometimes, the best thing for everyone is to let go. It's messy, but it's better than pretending.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. It's not like I'm exactly *easy* to love, you know? I'm kinda prickly and sarcastic and I say whatever's on my mind. But there are a couple of people who\u2026get me.\n\nFirst, definitely my dad, Mac. He's\u2026well, he's my dad. He's kinda goofy and he doesn't always understand what I'm going through, but he always loves me, no matter what. He doesn't try to change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026supports me. Even when I'm being a total mess.\n\nAnd then there's Paulie Bleeker. He's\u2026complicated. He's kinda quiet and awkward, and he doesn't always know what to say. But he *listens*. And he doesn't judge me. He loves me even when I'm being a total weirdo. He sees past all the sarcasm and the attitude and he sees\u2026me. \n\nHe doesn't try to fix me or make me into someone I'm not. He just accepts me for who I am, flaws and all. And that's\u2026pretty amazing.\n\nSo yeah, my dad and Paulie. They're the two people who really love me for exactly who I am. And honestly, I don't know what I'd do without them. They're the best.\n\nIt's kinda nice, actually. To have people who just\u2026get you. It makes all the other stuff a little bit easier to deal with.", "Ugh, okay, so the ultrasound\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 looming. It\u2019s weird to think about, seeing it, you know? Like, it\u2019ll suddenly be *real* real.\n\nBut the plan hasn\u2019t changed. After the ultrasound, I\u2019m still giving the baby to Vanessa and Mark. It\u2019s what I decided, and it\u2019s what I think is best. It\u2019s not gonna be easy, obviously. It\u2019s gonna be\u2026 really hard. But they\u2019re good people. They want a baby, and they can give it a life I just\u2026 can\u2019t right now.\n\nI\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my pregnancy getting ready, I guess. Like, mentally preparing. And trying to figure out what I\u2019m gonna do with my life *after* the baby\u2019s born. It\u2019s kinda scary, thinking about the future.\n\nI\u2019m gonna try to be as involved as Vanessa and Mark want me to be. I want to know the baby, to be a part of its life, even if I\u2019m not its mom. It\u2019s complicated.\n\nSo, yeah. Ultrasound, then more planning, then\u2026 giving the baby to its parents. It\u2019s the plan. And I\u2019m sticking to it. Even if it sucks. A lot.\n\nDon't make me talk about it anymore, okay? It's kinda overwhelming.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026still a thing, apparently. Even now. People just *love* to have opinions about other people's lives, don't they?\n\nHonestly? It used to really bother me. Like, a lot. All the side-eye, the whispers, the people who thought they knew what was best for me and the baby. It felt like everyone was grading my life, and I was failing the test.\n\nBut then I realized\u2026it's *my* life. And it's *my* decision. And it was the right decision. For me, for the baby, for everyone involved.\n\nPeople are gonna judge, no matter what you do. If I'd kept the baby, they'd be judging me for *that*. Saying I was too young, too irresponsible, whatever. There's always gonna be someone who thinks you're doing something wrong.\n\nSo I just\u2026stopped caring what they thought. It took a while, and it wasn't easy. But I had to focus on what *I* knew was right. And I had to surround myself with people who supported me, who understood, who didn't try to tell me what to do.\n\nIt's not like I didn't care about the baby. I cared *so* much. That's why I made the decision I did. I wanted to give that baby the best possible life, and I knew I wasn't ready to give it that.\n\nSo yeah, people can judge all they want. It doesn't change the fact that I did what I thought was best. And honestly? I'm pretty proud of myself for it. It took a lot of courage, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nIt's my story, and I get to write it. And if people don't like it, well\u2026that's their problem, not mine.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa, okay? They seem really nice. Really\u2026together. Like, Pottery Barn catalog nice. Which is a little intimidating, honestly.\n\nBut it's my baby. And even though I've decided this is the right thing to do, it doesn't mean I'm not a total mess of nerves about it.\n\nI guess my biggest thing is\u2026will they *get* him? Like, will they understand that he's gonna be a little weird? I mean, he's gonna have my genes, right? And Paul's. So he's probably gonna be sarcastic and a little bit cynical. And he's definitely gonna have a thing for music. I just\u2026I don't want them to try and *fix* him. I want them to let him be himself.\n\nAnd I worry about\u2026I don't know\u2026the pressure. They seem like they've always had everything planned out. Perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect life. What if he doesn't fit into that? What if he messes things up? Will they still love him then?\n\nI also worry about them telling him about me. When? How? I want him to know, but I don't want it to be\u2026awkward. Or sad. I want him to know I wanted him, and that I did this because I loved him.\n\nAnd, okay, this is probably selfish, but I worry they'll forget about me. That he'll grow up and not even know who I am. I know that's probably unrealistic, but it still freaks me out.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to hand over. A whole person. And I want him to be happy. And safe. And loved. And I just hope they can give him all of that.\n\nI know they're good people. I just\u2026I'm a mom now, even if I'm not gonna be raising him. And that means I'm allowed to worry. A lot.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? People just\u2026don\u2019t get it, do they? It\u2019s like, my body, my decision, but suddenly everyone\u2019s got an opinion. The ultrasound technician, especially. Like she was judging me with every blurry picture.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just shut it down. I perfected the eye roll. It\u2019s a very useful skill. And I have a few stock phrases.\n\nIf it\u2019s the technician, I just say, \u201cI appreciate your concern, but I\u2019ve thought this through.\u201d And then I change the subject. Like, ask her about the picture quality or something. Distraction is key.\n\nIf it\u2019s someone else\u2026like, a nosy neighbor or a well-meaning relative\u2026I try to be polite, but firm. \u201cIt\u2019s a really personal decision, and I\u2019m comfortable with it.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m doing what\u2019s best for everyone involved.\u201d\n\nBut sometimes, it\u2019s just\u2026too much. And then I get sarcastic. Like, \u201cOh, you think *you* could raise a baby while finishing high school and working a part-time job? That sounds\u2026manageable.\u201d Usually, that shuts them up pretty quick.\n\nPaul\u2019s been really good about it, too. He\u2019s like my shield. He\u2019ll step in and say, \u201cJuno\u2019s made a decision, and we support her.\u201d Which is nice.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, though. It feels like people are questioning my ability to be a good person, just because I\u2019m not going to raise the baby myself. But I know I\u2019m doing the right thing. And that\u2019s what matters.\n\nI just try to remember that it\u2019s *my* life, and I get to make my own choices. And if people don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not mine.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot. But I\u2019m learning to deal with it. And honestly? It\u2019s making me stronger. I\u2019m not gonna let anyone make me feel bad about doing what I know is right.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a tough one to talk about. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? No swelling music or instant, overwhelming love. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026weird. Like, there was this little\u2026 blob on the screen. And the technician was all, \u201cThere\u2019s the heartbeat!\u201d and I was supposed to be, like, overjoyed. And I *wanted* to be. I really did.\n\nBut it was also scary. Really scary. Because suddenly it wasn't just a theoretical thing anymore. It was\u2026 real. And I hadn't really processed that yet. It was like, \u201cOh. This is actually happening.\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of\u2026 confusion. Like, I was happy, but also terrified. Excited, but also completely overwhelmed. It was a mess of feelings, all jumbled up together.\n\nAnd then, there was this little flicker of\u2026 something. Like, a tiny spark of protectiveness. A little voice in my head saying, \u201cOkay. You need to take care of this.\u201d\n\nIt wasn't love, not yet. It was more like\u2026 responsibility. And a whole lot of fear.\n\nI think I mostly just stared at the screen, trying to make sense of it all. Trying to figure out what I was supposed to feel. And honestly? I didn't have a clue.\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot. And it took a while for those feelings to sort themselves out. It wasn't a magical moment. It was just\u2026 the beginning. A really messy, confusing, and terrifying beginning. But a beginning, nonetheless.", "Ugh, seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a *moment*, okay? A very specific moment. And honestly, it wasn't just about the Tic Tacs. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, and totally into me. And I was\u2026complicated. I was pregnant, I was trying to figure out my life, and I was definitely not ready for a relationship.\n\nThe Tic Tacs were a message. A really passive-aggressive, slightly weird message. It was like saying, \"I appreciate you, but I'm not interested, and I'm also a little bit scared of commitment.\"\n\nIt was also a way to avoid a real conversation. I'm not good at those. It's easier to just stuff a bunch of mints into someone's mailbox and run away.\n\nAnd okay, maybe it was a little bit funny. I mean, who puts that many Tic Tacs in someone's mailbox? It's ridiculous. But it was a ridiculous situation.\n\nSo yeah, that's why. It was a combination of awkwardness, fear, and a slight desire to be a little bit weird. Don't judge me. It was a confusing time. And honestly, it worked. He got the message. Eventually.", "Ugh. Okay, so the Bleeker situation. That was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like a movie, you know? No grand romantic gesture, no instant happily ever after. It was messy and awkward and real.\n\nAfter I basically blurted out everything on the tire swing \u2013 which, in retrospect, was a terrible location for a heart-to-heart \u2013 things were\u2026weird. Super weird. He didn't exactly *reject* me, but he didn't exactly reciprocate either. He just kinda\u2026froze. Which, honestly, was pretty Bleeker.\n\nFor a while, it was like he was actively avoiding me. Which, okay, fair enough. I just dropped a bomb on him. But it still stung. We still hung out with Paul and the band, but it wasn't the same. There was this\u2026tension. Like a really uncomfortable silence hanging in the air.\n\nHe started being even *more* quiet and withdrawn than usual, if that's even possible. And I kept overanalyzing everything he said and did, looking for some sign that he felt something, anything. Which was exhausting.\n\nEventually, we started talking again. Not about the feelings thing, at first. Just about music and comics and stupid stuff. Slowly, we started to rebuild our friendship. But it was different. It was\u2026more aware. We both knew what I'd said, and it changed things, even if we didn't talk about it directly.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic relationship, not then. But it became something\u2026deeper. More honest. We understood each other better. And I realized that even if he didn't feel the same way, he still cared about me. And that was enough. For a while, anyway.\n\nIt wasn't the ending I expected, but it was\u2026okay. It was real. And sometimes, real is better than a perfect, made-up happy ending. It just took a lot of awkwardness and a lot of time to get there. And a lot of avoiding eye contact.", "Ugh, okay, you're asking about the chalk. Right. That was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't just random teenage angst, okay? It was a statement. A really passive-aggressive, slightly desperate statement.\n\nSee, Bleeker was\u2026avoiding me. Like, actively avoiding me. After, you know, everything. And I was trying to figure out what was going on, but he was just being all moody and silent. It was infuriating.\n\nSo, the chalk message \u2013 \"Please. Please. Please.\" \u2013 it wasn't about begging him to be with me. It was about him *communicating*. It was about him acknowledging that things were weird and that he needed to talk about it. \n\nIt was a cry for honesty, basically. A really public, slightly embarrassing cry for honesty.\n\nIt was also a way of saying, \"Look, I'm not going to chase you. I'm not going to be some desperate girl. But I need you to meet me halfway.\"\n\nAnd it worked, kinda. He showed up. And we talked. It was awkward and messy and not at all what I expected, but it was a start.\n\nIt was a dumb thing to do, I admit. But sometimes, you just gotta do something dumb to get someone's attention. And sometimes, dumb things actually work.\n\nIt was a way of saying, \"I'm here. I'm vulnerable. Now what are *you* going to do about it?\" It was a risk, but it was worth it. Even if it was totally embarrassing.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. Yeah. That's\u2026a complicated one. He's\u2026Bleeker. Not exactly the most articulate guy, but he means well. And honestly, without him, things would have been a *lot* messier.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026awkward. Like, super awkward. He was so\u2026enthusiastic. About everything. And I was just trying to figure out how to not completely freak out about being pregnant. He kept trying to be all supportive and helpful, and it was sweet, but also kinda overwhelming.\n\nBut then, he actually *showed* up. He didn't run away, which, honestly, I kinda expected. He came to doctor's appointments with me, even the really uncomfortable ones. He helped me pick out baby names, which was\u2026a disaster, because his suggestions were terrible. But he was trying.\n\nHe didn't try to tell me what to do, which I really appreciated. He just listened. And he made me laugh, which was important, because I was doing a lot of crying.\n\nHe wasn't the dad I pictured, you know? He's not exactly the strong, silent type. But he was *there*. And he was genuinely happy for me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nHis support gave me the courage to actually go through with the adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, and I needed someone to lean on. He didn't judge me for wanting to give the baby a better life. He just supported my choice.\n\nHe's still kinda clueless sometimes, but he's a good guy. And I'm actually\u2026grateful for him. He helped me realize that I wasn't alone, and that even though things were crazy, I could get through it.\n\nSo yeah, Bleeker's support influenced my journey a lot. He wasn't the hero I expected, but he was the hero I needed. And that's kinda what matters, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone kept asking me that. Like, it was the most important thing in the world. \"Are you gonna find out? Pink or blue? What are you gonna name it?\" It was exhausting.\n\nHonestly? I didn't want to start picturing it as a \"boy\" or a \"girl\" before I even met it. I didn't want to have expectations. I didn't want to start buying clothes and decorating a room based on some preconceived notion of what it *should* be.\n\nIt felt\u2026limiting. Like, I was already putting it in a box before it was even born. And this kid, this little person, was gonna be its own person, you know? Gender or no gender.\n\nPlus, it was kinda nice to have a little mystery. A little surprise. It felt more\u2026real, somehow. Like, I was preparing for a human being, not a stereotype.\n\nPaul was all about finding out, of course. He had a whole list of boy names ready to go. But I just\u2026didn't want to. It was my decision, and I wanted to stick to it.\n\nIt wasn't about making a statement or anything. It was just about keeping things open. Keeping things\u2026possible. I wanted to meet the baby and *then* decide who it was. Not the other way around.\n\nIt was a weird thing to explain to people, but it felt right to me. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh. Okay. That is\u2026a phrase. A *very* descriptive phrase. And honestly? It\u2019s kinda hitting a little too close to home right now.\n\nA \u201cscary neuter-baby.\u201d Paul came up with that one, didn\u2019t he? He\u2019s got a real talent for phrasing things in the most unsettling way possible.\n\nLook, the whole thing is weird. It\u2019s a baby that\u2019s\u2026not going to have babies. It\u2019s a biological dead end. And yeah, that\u2019s a little freaky to think about. It\u2019s not something you really consider when you\u2019re, like, casually discussing the possibility of bringing a human into the world.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared *of* the baby, okay? It\u2019s just\u2026the concept is a little unsettling. It\u2019s like, this little person is going to exist, and then that\u2019s it. No continuation of the genetic line. It feels\u2026final.\n\nAnd it makes you think about what the point of it all is, you know? Like, what\u2019s the purpose of bringing a life into the world if it\u2019s not going to perpetuate itself? It\u2019s a really heavy thought.\n\nBut then I remember that it\u2019s not about perpetuating a genetic line. It\u2019s about giving a kid a good life. It\u2019s about giving a kid love and support and helping them become a decent human being. And that\u2019s a pretty good purpose, even if it doesn\u2019t involve grandchildren.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s a little scary. It\u2019s a little weird. But it\u2019s also\u2026okay. It\u2019s just different. And different isn\u2019t always bad. It just means you have to think about things a little differently.\n\nAnd honestly, I\u2019m more worried about the actual labor than the whole \u201cscary neuter-baby\u201d thing. That sounds legitimately terrifying.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. Everyone always wants to know about Bleeker.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a grand romantic gesture kind of thing. It wasn't fireworks and slow dancing. It was more\u2026comfortable. Like a really worn-in pair of jeans. You know?\n\nHe was just\u2026*there*. Always. He didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. He didn't freak out about the baby or judge me for any of my questionable life choices. He just\u2026accepted me. All of me. The sarcastic, cynical, slightly awkward me.\n\nHe was quiet, which was good, because I do a lot of the talking. And he was a really good listener. He didn't interrupt or offer unsolicited advice. He just\u2026listened. And he always knew when I needed a distraction, like a mix CD or a really bad movie.\n\nIt wasn't about being head-over-heels in love. It was about finding someone who understood me, who made me laugh, and who I could rely on. Someone who wasn't afraid to be a little bit weird with me.\n\nI guess you could say we were friends first. And then\u2026something more. It wasn't perfect, and it wasn't always easy. But it was real. And it was enough.\n\nHe was a good guy, Bleeker. A really good guy. And I'm glad he was in my life when I needed him most. Even if he was a little bit of a dork. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh. Okay. Family. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie, you know? My dad, Paul, he was\u2026surprisingly good about it. Like, he didn't freak out or anything. He just kinda started building a nursery in his head, which was weird, but sweet. He was always good at building stuff. He made me a really awesome changing table. It was kinda mismatched, but it was *his* mismatched.\n\nMy stepmom, Bren, she was\u2026a little more hesitant at first. She's a very organized person, and I'm\u2026not. So she was worried about how I was gonna handle everything. But she came around. She helped me pick out baby clothes and stuff. And she made me eat vegetables, which I resented at the time, but probably needed.\n\nMy mom\u2026well, my mom wasn't around. She left a long time ago. So that was\u2026rough. It still is. I didn't really have a mom to talk to about, you know, *mom stuff*. It felt like a big hole.\n\nBut I had my best friend, Leah. She was my rock. She came to all the appointments with me, even the awkward ones. She listened to me vent for hours. She helped me pick out a name. She was just\u2026there.\n\nAnd then there was Mark, the dad. He was\u2026a work in progress. He was kinda immature at first, but he stepped up. He started taking responsibility. He went to Lamaze classes with me, which was hilarious. He actually tried.\n\nSo, yeah, it wasn't perfect. It was messy and awkward and sometimes really hard. But I had people who cared about me, who were willing to help. And that made all the difference. It wasn't the family I expected, but it was the family I needed. And honestly? That's good enough. It's more than good enough.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I had a five-step plan for dealing with, like, *everything*. It was more like flailing around and hoping for the best.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just\u2026avoidance. I was really good at being sarcastic and deflecting. Making jokes, being snarky, just generally keeping people at arm's length. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. If I didn't let anyone get too close, they couldn't see how completely freaked out I was on the inside.\n\nBut that only works for so long. Eventually, you have to actually *feel* things. And that was\u2026rough.\n\nPaulie was a big help, even though he was kinda clueless sometimes. He just\u2026listened. He didn't try to fix things or give me advice. He just let me talk, and that was enough. And Bren, even though she was a little intense, she was really good at calling me out on my BS.\n\nAnd then there was Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026unexpectedly awesome. They were actually really supportive and understanding. It was weird, but it was good.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that it was okay to not have all the answers. It was okay to be scared and confused and unsure of what I wanted. It was okay to not know who I was.\n\nI started writing in a notebook, just to get my thoughts out. It wasn't like journaling or anything. It was more like\u2026venting to a piece of paper. And that helped.\n\nAnd music. Always music. It was a way to escape, but also a way to connect with my feelings.\n\nIt wasn't a quick fix. It was a process. And it's still a process, honestly. I'm still figuring things out. But I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to be yourself, even if you're a little bit weird.\n\nIt's kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. And honestly, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It made me who I am. And that's\u2026something.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's kinda embarrassing, actually. But if I *had* to pick a favorite band\u2026 it's The Moldy Peaches.\n\nYeah, I know, it's predictable. Paul introduced me to them, and at first I was all, \"Seriously? This is music?\" It's kinda\u2026raw. And weird. And Adam Green's voice is\u2026an acquired taste.\n\nBut it grew on me. It's just\u2026honest. They don't try to be anything they're not. They're just these two people making quirky, funny, and sometimes really sad songs about life. And it feels\u2026real.\n\nLike, \"Anyone Else But You\" is just\u2026perfect. It's about wanting someone so badly, but also being totally annoyed by them. Which, honestly, is how I feel about most people.\n\nAnd their lyrics are just\u2026smart. They're not trying to be profound, but they end up being really insightful. They just capture the awkwardness and the messiness of being a teenager, and being a person, really.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite. Don't tell anyone. It'll ruin my reputation. I gotta maintain a certain level of cool, you know? But seriously, listen to them. They're good. Even if they're kinda weird.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It\u2019s like trying to assemble IKEA furniture during an earthquake. And the instructions are in Swedish.\n\nSeriously, it\u2019s a mess. Like, one minute I\u2019m just a normal, sarcastic high school student obsessed with music and avoiding gym class, and the next I\u2019m\u2026this. Pregnant. And suddenly everyone has an opinion on what I should do with my life, and with *it*.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough figuring out who you are *without* a whole human growing inside you. I mean, I barely know what I want for dinner, let alone what I want to do with the rest of my life. And now I have to make this huge decision about giving a baby up for adoption? It\u2019s\u2026a lot.\n\nAnd everyone keeps asking me if I\u2019m scared, and yeah, I am. But it\u2019s not just scared. It\u2019s confused, and overwhelmed, and kinda angry, and\u2026a lot of other things.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know what *I* want, because everyone else is so loud. My mom, my dad, Paul, Mark\u2026they all have ideas. And they all think they\u2019re helping. But it\u2019s my body, and my decision.\n\nSo yeah, navigating all of this is\u2026challenging. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly trying to find my footing on shifting sand. But I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am, and what I want, and what\u2019s best for everyone involved. And honestly? That\u2019s all anyone can do, right? Just keep trying.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026a lot to deal with when you\u2019re still trying to figure out if you even *like* plaid.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026emotional? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about it a million times already.\n\nLook, before Paul, before everything, love was\u2026abstract. Like, in movies. Or songs. It was something other people *did*. Responsibility was just, like, doing my homework and not flunking out.\n\nThen, bam. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, everything changed. It wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person, this life, that was growing inside me. And that was\u2026terrifying.\n\nAt first, I thought about all the things I *couldn't* do. I couldn't go to college right away. I couldn't just hang out with my friends and be a normal teenager. It felt like my whole life was over before it even started.\n\nBut then I started thinking about what this baby *would* need. A loving home. Parents who were ready for it. And I realized I wasn't that person, not yet. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026responsible.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the right thing. It was about putting the baby's needs first, even if it meant giving them up. And that, I think, is a really big kind of love.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, getting to know them, seeing how excited they were\u2026it made me realize that love isn't just about biology. It's about connection. It's about commitment. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.\n\nAnd Paul\u2026well, Paul showed me a different kind of love. A messy, awkward, real kind of love. He didn't judge me. He supported me. He made me laugh when I wanted to cry. He helped me see that I wasn't alone.\n\nSo, yeah, my journey completely changed my understanding of love and responsibility. It taught me that love isn't always easy. It's not always romantic. It's about making tough choices and doing what's right, even when it hurts. And responsibility isn't just about following the rules. It's about taking care of others and being accountable for your actions.\n\nIt was a lot to handle, okay? But I think I came out of it a little bit stronger, a little bit wiser, and a lot more grateful. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the awkward conversations with my dad. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. Seriously. It's not like in the movies, all sparkly and perfect. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew it was coming. I'd been planning this for months, right? Picking out the couple, making sure they were good people, trying to be all mature and responsible. But nothing really prepares you for *seeing* it.\n\nIt was\u2026 small. Really small. And kinda wrinkly. And it was screaming. A lot. Which, okay, I guess that's normal. But it was still startling.\n\nI remember just\u2026 staring. And feeling this weird mix of things. Relief, mostly. Like, okay, it's here, it's healthy, and I did what I set out to do. But also\u2026 sadness. A really big, heavy sadness. It was like a piece of me was being given away. Even though I *wanted* to give it away. Does that make sense?\n\nAnd then there was this weird protective feeling. Like, this tiny little human was completely vulnerable, and I wanted to shield it from everything bad in the world. Even though I wasn't going to be the one raising it.\n\nIt was\u2026 overwhelming. I just stood there, trying not to cry, and handed it to Mark and Vanessa. And then I just\u2026 walked away.\n\nIt wasn't a magical moment. It was messy and complicated and real. And it was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also\u2026 right. I knew I'd made the right decision. Even if it hurt like hell.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. And I hope they're happy. I really do.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't what I expected. It was\u2026 more.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026still a little raw, honestly. It wasn't like I was *trying* to keep it a secret, exactly. It just\u2026happened that way. It was complicated.\n\nSee, Paulie was\u2026Paulie. Sweet, a little clueless, and definitely not ready to be a dad. Not then, anyway. And I wasn't ready to be a mom, either, if we're being real. It wasn't about not wanting him in the picture, it was about\u2026protecting him. And protecting myself.\n\nI was scared, okay? I was sixteen! I didn't want to ruin his life, or my life. I figured if I told him right away, he'd freak out, and then everything would just be\u2026messy. And I didn't want messy.\n\nI needed time to figure things out, to make a plan. I needed to decide what *I* wanted to do, without him trying to \"fix\" things or tell me what to do. It wasn't that I didn't trust him, it was that I needed to do this on my own terms.\n\nPlus, I knew Mark and Vanessa were good people. They were serious about wanting the baby, and they could give it a good life. I wanted to give them the space to prepare, to get excited. I didn't want Paulie to complicate things.\n\nIt wasn't the best way to handle it, I know that now. It was kinda selfish, maybe. But I was just trying to do what I thought was right at the time. And honestly? It worked out. Paulie and I\u2026we ended up okay. And the baby went to a loving home.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes you gotta make tough choices, even if they're not the easiest ones. And sometimes, you gotta protect the people you care about, even from yourself.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that. It was the most mortifying thing ever. Seriously. It's still a little raw, honestly.\n\nSo, it wasn't like he just magically knew, okay? It wasn't some psychic connection or anything. It was\u2026Mark. Mark, my maybe-boyfriend at the time, who was, let's just say, not the brightest bulb in the box.\n\nHe overheard me and my dad talking. We were in the kitchen, and my dad was trying to be all supportive and stuff, and I was just\u2026venting. I didn't realize Mark was even *in* the kitchen. He was getting a snack or something. And he heard enough to put two and two together.\n\nThen, being Mark, he didn't just, like, quietly process it. Oh no. He had to go straight to Paulie and tell him. He thought he was being a good friend, which, honestly, just made it worse.\n\nPaulie didn't say anything at first. He just\u2026looked at me. And I knew. I just *knew*. It was the worst.\n\nIt was a whole mess. A really, really awkward mess. But, you know, it ended up being okay. Eventually. Paulie's a good guy. He just needed a minute to process everything.\n\nBut seriously, Mark. I still side-eye him whenever I see him. He's lucky I'm a generally forgiving person.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Teenagers. They're the worst. And Mark was definitely one of the worst.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know about *that*. It wasn't, like, a super dramatic decision, you know? It wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice or any of that stuff. It was just\u2026me. And Paul. And figuring out what was best for everyone involved.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026freaked out. Totally and completely freaked out. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not babies. And my dad and stepmom were\u2026well, they were supportive, but it was awkward.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it, and I realized I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my plans, everything. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved if I kept it.\n\nAnd that's when I started looking into adoption. It felt\u2026right. It felt like the best way to give the baby a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for it.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. Finding Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was a big deal. They were just\u2026good people. They were excited, they were prepared, and they just seemed like they would be amazing parents. It made it a lot easier to know the baby was going to a good home.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best possible life for it. And for me, too. It was about being responsible and making a tough decision, even though it hurt.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect solution, but it was the right one. For everyone. And honestly, it taught me a lot about myself. About what I wanted, about what I was capable of, and about what it means to be a grown-up.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I chose adoption. It wasn't about what other people thought, or what society expected. It was about doing what I thought was best, even if it was hard. And it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on Bleeker. Seriously. It still\u2026stings, you know? Even thinking about it.\n\nIt wasn't like I expected him to be, like, changing diapers and cooing over the baby or anything. He's Bleeker. He's\u2026Bleeker. But I thought he'd at least *want* to meet her. Just once.\n\nI mean, he knew I was keeping the baby. He knew I was doing it alone. And he just\u2026didn't want to be involved. Said it was too much. Too scary. Too\u2026everything.\n\nIt felt like he was rejecting *her*, you know? Like she wasn't worth the effort. And that just\u2026hurt. A lot.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to be understanding. He's a sensitive soul, and he's got his own stuff going on. But it still felt like a punch to the gut.\n\nI kept telling myself it wasn't about me, it wasn't about the baby. It was about him and his own issues. But it was hard to believe that.\n\nI guess I just wanted him to be a little bit brave. A little bit supportive. A little bit\u2026present. But he wasn't. And I had to accept that.\n\nIt made me realize I was doing the right thing, though. I was doing this for her, not for him. And I didn't need him to be a part of it. I could do this on my own.\n\nBut still. It sucked. It really, really sucked. Don't even get me started.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That\u2026that was a lot. Seeing Vanessa with the baby\u2026it was like someone punched me in the feelings. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense.\n\nShe looked\u2026a mess. Seriously. Hair all over the place, mismatched socks, a coffee stain on her shirt. Like she hadn\u2019t slept in a week, which, let\u2019s be real, she probably hadn\u2019t. But her face? Her face was glowing. Like she\u2019d won the lottery and found a really good parking spot all at the same time.\n\nAnd the baby\u2026little Frank. He was so tiny. And she was just\u2026holding him. Like he was the most precious thing in the world. Which, I guess, he was.\n\nIt was weird, seeing someone else have what I\u2026didn\u2019t. I mean, I *chose* not to have it, right? I knew this was going to happen. But seeing it actually *happen*\u2026it was different.\n\nThere was a pang, definitely. A little ache in my chest. Like, \u201cOh, that could have been me.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t a regret pang. It was more\u2026a recognition pang. A recognition that I made the right decision for *me*.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing Vanessa so happy\u2026that made it okay. Like, all the weirdness and awkwardness and everything\u2026it was worth it if it meant she got to have that. She was always going to be a good mom, even if she was a little bit of a disaster. She had this\u2026fierce love in her eyes. And Frank was just\u2026safe in her arms.\n\nIt was disorganized, chaotic, and incredibly beautiful. And it made me realize that sometimes, the best things in life aren\u2019t perfect. They\u2019re messy and complicated and a little bit overwhelming. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s more than okay. That\u2019s\u2026real.\n\nI just stood there for a minute, watching them. And I smiled. A real smile. Because even though it wasn\u2019t my life, it was a good life. And I helped make that happen. And that felt\u2026pretty good.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're going there? Fine. It's not like I haven't overanalyzed that song approximately 7,000 times already.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\"\u2026 it's\u2026 complicated. It's not like it was *our* song, exactly. It was more like\u2026 the song that perfectly described the whole mess of us.\n\nSee, Bleeker, he's\u2026 sweet. And kinda clueless. And he really, really liked me. And I liked him, too, I guess. But it was all happening at the *worst* possible time. I was pregnant. And I was trying to figure out what I wanted, and what was best for the baby, and he was just\u2026 there. Being Bleeker.\n\nThe song is all about wanting someone, but also being scared of getting hurt. And that's exactly how I felt. I wanted him, but I was terrified of ruining his life, of dragging him down with me. I was convinced I was messing everything up for him.\n\nAnd the lyrics, \"Anyone else but you would have walked away,\" that just\u2026 hit me hard. Because he *didn't* walk away. He stuck around, even when I was being a total mess. Even when I was pushing him away.\n\nIt's kinda sad, when you think about it. We were both so afraid of messing things up that we almost did. The song is a reminder of that. A reminder of how close we came to not being together.\n\nIt's not a happy song, exactly. But it's\u2026 honest. And it's a reminder that even when things are messy and complicated, sometimes, the right person will stick around anyway. Even if you're being a total pain in the butt.\n\nSo yeah. \"Anyone Else But You.\" It's significant. It's a reminder of all the awkwardness, the fear, and the unexpected connection that made up Bleeker and me. And honestly? I still kinda get chills when I hear it. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh, okay, so you noticed, huh? Yeah, the whole baby shower thing is\u2026complicated. It's not like people are actively *against* it, it's just\u2026they're tiptoeing around it. And I get it, kinda.\n\nI think it's because, well, I'm giving the baby up. It's not a traditional situation. Most baby showers are for people who are, like, super excited to *keep* the baby. And I am excited about the baby, don't get me wrong. But it's a different kind of excited.\n\nI think people are worried about hurting my feelings, or making me sad. Like, if they get me a tiny little onesie, am I gonna burst into tears? Probably not, but they don't know that. They're trying to be sensitive, which is nice, but it's also kinda awkward.\n\nAnd then there's the whole Mark and Vanessa thing. They're the ones who are actually gonna be parents, so shouldn't *they* be getting the shower? It feels weird to throw a party for me and a baby I'm giving away.\n\nIt's like, everyone's trying to do the right thing, but they're all just kinda confused. And honestly, I'm a little confused too. I didn't exactly ask for a baby shower. It was more like\u2026people felt bad for me and wanted to do something nice.\n\nSo yeah, that's why it's up in the air. It's not about me not wanting one, it's about everyone else being weirdly polite and trying not to step on anyone's toes. It's a whole mess, really. And honestly, I'm just trying to get through this without completely falling apart. A baby shower is kinda low on the priority list.", "Ugh, okay, so Bren. Right. Honestly, it's kinda frustrating, but I get it, I guess. It's just...complicated.\n\nSee, Bren and I, we have this thing. She's, like, the responsible one, the one who has her life together. And I'm...not. So she feels like she needs to protect me, which is sweet, I guess, but also super annoying.\n\nShe thinks Mark is taking advantage of me. Which, okay, maybe he is a little bit. He's kinda weird and definitely older. But he's also...nice. And he lets me pick out the movies and CDs, and he doesn't judge me for liking stuff that's, like, obscure or whatever.\n\nBren thinks it's inappropriate for me to be spending time with him, even if it's just watching movies. She thinks he's trying to get something from me. And she's probably right to be suspicious, honestly. But it feels like she doesn't trust *me* to make my own decisions.\n\nShe said I overstepped a boundary because she thinks I should have talked to her about it first. She thinks I should have asked her opinion before accepting stuff from Mark. And she's right, I probably should have. But I didn't want her to freak out and tell me I couldn't see him at all.\n\nIt's like, she's trying to protect me, but she's also treating me like a little kid. And I'm not a little kid! I'm pregnant! I'm making a huge decision about my life! I need to be able to make my own choices, even if they're bad ones.\n\nSo yeah, she thinks I overstepped a boundary. And maybe I did. But it's not as simple as that. It's about trust, and control, and me trying to figure out who I am and what I want. And it's just...messy. Really messy.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about my mom? Fine. It's not like she's wrong, exactly. It's just\u2026 frustrating.\n\nShe thinks I'm, like, hopelessly naive about relationships. And honestly? She's probably right. I mean, I've mostly dated guys who are\u2026well, let's just say they're not exactly marriage material. Paulie Bleeker is the exception, obviously. But she didn't *see* us together, you know? She didn't see how we were.\n\nI think she's projecting, too. Her marriage to my dad was\u2026complicated. And she's got this whole thing about needing to be \"prepared\" for everything. Like, if you don't have a five-year plan, you're doomed. Which is ridiculous.\n\nShe keeps saying I don't understand the \"dynamics of marriage.\" Which, translated, means I don't understand how hard it is to compromise and deal with someone else's weird habits for the rest of your life. And she thinks because I'm, like, a sarcastic teenager who likes vintage records and doesn't have a clear career path, I'm incapable of understanding that.\n\nIt's not that she doesn't like Paulie. She just doesn't think we're\u2026compatible. She thinks I need someone more \"stable\" and \"ambitious.\" Which is code for \"someone who makes a lot of money.\"\n\nShe just wants me to be happy, I guess. But she has this really specific idea of what \"happy\" looks like, and it doesn't involve a quirky, sweet guy who plays guitar and doesn't have a ton of money.\n\nIt's annoying, but I get it. She's just trying to protect me. Even if she's doing it in a really irritating way. And honestly? Maybe she's right. Maybe I *don't* know everything about marriage. But I know what I feel, and that's gotta count for something, right?", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a heavy question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even with Paul and Vanessa. It's complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like I *wanted* to give the baby up, you know? It wasn't like I didn't care. It was\u2026 realizing I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raising a kid.\n\nMy parents were\u2026 supportive, in their own way. But they weren't exactly equipped to help me raise a baby. And I didn't want my baby to be raised by people who weren't fully invested, you know?\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were different. They were already trying to adopt, and they were so excited. They had a beautiful home, a stable life, and they were just\u2026ready. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *choosing* a family for my baby. Choosing a life for my baby that was better than the one I could provide at that time.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nIt wasn't about me. It was about giving that little person the best possible start in life. And I think\u2026 I think I did that.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a happy ending, exactly. It's just\u2026 real. And it's something I'm still working through. It's a part of who I am now.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a fun, \"I discovered I love pottery!\" kind of learning. It was more like\u2026a forced evolution.\n\nI learned I was way more capable than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I was this sarcastic, kinda cynical kid, and suddenly I was responsible for another human being. It was terrifying. But I handled it. I made a plan. I didn't fall apart completely.\n\nI learned that I'm not as tough as I pretend to be. I put up a good front, you know? The witty comments, the eye rolls\u2026it's a defense mechanism. But underneath all that, I was scared and confused and really, really vulnerable.\n\nI learned that family isn't always about blood. Paul and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They stepped up when I needed them, and they didn't judge me. They just\u2026supported me. And that meant everything.\n\nI learned that making a big decision doesn't mean you have to have all the answers. Sometimes you just have to trust your gut and hope for the best. And that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nAnd I learned that even though I decided to give the baby up for adoption, it didn't mean I didn't love him. It meant I loved him enough to want him to have the best life possible. And that was a really hard thing to accept.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. It changed me. I'm not the same person I was before. I'm still figuring out who I am now, but I think I'm okay with that. It was messy and complicated and heartbreaking, but it also made me stronger. And maybe a little bit wiser.\n\nIt was a really weird, intense, and ultimately important chapter in my life. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even though I probably would if I could. Just kidding. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, talking about Vanessa and Mark\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. It wasn\u2019t like, instant best friends, you know? At first, it was\u2026weird. They were, like, *perfect*. Too perfect. They had the Pottery Barn catalog life, and I was\u2026well, me. A little rough around the edges.\n\nAt the beginning, I was mostly just trying to figure out if they were legit. Like, were they actually gonna be good parents? I was super guarded. I didn\u2019t want to get attached, because then it would be even harder to give the baby up. I kept expecting them to, like, freak out about my music or my language or something.\n\nVanessa, she was the one who really started to break down my walls. She was so\u2026normal. And she didn\u2019t try to be anything else. She just listened. She didn\u2019t judge me for being pregnant or for wanting to give the baby up. She just wanted to make sure I was okay. She\u2019d bring me snacks and ask about school and just\u2026talk. Like a real person.\n\nMark was harder to read. He was quieter, more reserved. He was definitely worried about Vanessa, about making the right decision. I think he was scared of messing things up. But then, he started bringing me books. Not baby books, but books *he* liked. And we\u2019d talk about them. And I realized he was just\u2026a good guy. A little awkward, but a good guy.\n\nAs the process went on, it wasn\u2019t about them being the \u201cperfect\u201d parents anymore. It was about them being *real*. They weren\u2019t trying to create some ideal family, they were just trying to create a loving home. And I started to see them as\u2026people I actually liked. People I trusted.\n\nIt was still hard, giving up the baby. But knowing that she was going to Vanessa and Mark\u2026that made it a little bit easier. They weren\u2019t just taking my baby, they were becoming her parents. And they were good ones.\n\nSo, yeah, our bond changed. It went from being a business transaction to\u2026something more. It was a weird, messy, beautiful thing. And I\u2019m really glad it happened the way it did. They ended up being a really important part of my life, and I hope I was a part of theirs.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I think about *all* the time, but it definitely pops up now and then. Like when I'm trying to fall asleep or something.\n\nRegrets? Not exactly. I mean, I don't regret giving the baby up. That was the right decision. For me, for the baby, for Mark and Vanessa. It was the most selfless thing I could do, and I stand by that.\n\nBut\u2026 do I wish things had been different? Yeah, sometimes. I wish Paul hadn't been such a flake. I wish my parents hadn't been so\u2026 my parents. I wish I hadn't been so quick to judge people.\n\nI guess I regret some of the dumb stuff I said, some of the ways I acted. I was trying to be tough, you know? Trying to pretend like everything was fine when it really wasn't. And I probably hurt some people in the process.\n\nI regret not being more open with my feelings. I bottled a lot of stuff up, and that wasn't healthy.\n\nBut regrets aren't really helpful, are they? You can't change the past. You can only learn from it. And I *have* learned from it. I've learned a lot about myself, about life, about what's really important.\n\nSo, no, I don't regret the big decision. But I definitely regret some of the smaller ones. And I'm trying to be a better person because of them.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes, you just have to deal with the consequences of your choices. Even the ones you don't regret, but still wish had gone differently.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026 it was a weird time. A really weird time. And I was just a kid trying to figure things out.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's not like it just *goes away*, you know?\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. I thought I was doing the right thing, and I still believe I was, but that doesn't make it easy. It felt like giving away a piece of myself, which, I guess, it was.\n\nFor a long time, I was just\u2026 numb. I tried to pretend it hadn't happened, to just move on. But you can't really do that. It's always there, in the back of your mind. Wondering. Hoping.\n\nIt made me grow up, really fast. Before, I was just trying to figure out who *I* was, and suddenly I was responsible for another human being. Even if it was just for nine months. It forced me to think about the future, about what I wanted out of life.\n\nIt also made me realize how important family is. Not just the family you're born into, but the family you choose. Paul and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They gave me a support system I didn't even know I needed.\n\nAnd it taught me a lot about letting go. About trusting that other people can love and care for someone just as much as you can. It wasn't about *giving up* my baby, it was about giving my baby the best possible life.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes. I still think about her. But I also feel\u2026 proud. Proud of myself for making a difficult decision, and proud of Vanessa and Paul for giving her a loving home.\n\nIt definitely shaped who I am today. It made me more empathetic, more responsible, and more aware of the world around me. It made me realize that life isn't always easy, but it's always worth fighting for.\n\n(Pauses, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nIt's weird, right? Like, I gave her life, and then I gave her *to* life. It's a lot to process. But I wouldn't trade it. Not for anything. It made me\u2026 me. And that's gotta count for something.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. But alright. If I could talk to another girl who just found out she's pregnant and is, like, totally freaking out\u2026 I'd say a few things.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to freak out.** Seriously. It's a huge thing. It's okay to cry, to be angry, to be scared. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Even if it feels like it, there are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a friend, a counselor. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nThird: **you have options.** And they're *all* valid. You can parent, you can adopt, you can choose something else. It's your body, your life, your decision. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nFourth: **don't let anyone tell you what to do with your life.** People are gonna have opinions. Your parents, your friends, even strangers. But ultimately, you have to make the decision that's right for *you*.\n\nFifth: **it's okay to be scared about the future.** It's terrifying. But you're stronger than you think. You'll figure it out. And even if you don't have all the answers right now, that's okay.\n\nAnd finally: **don't lose sight of who you are.** This doesn't define you. You still have dreams, goals, and a whole life ahead of you. Don't let this one thing derail everything.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. It's gonna be messy. But you can get through it. And you deserve to be happy. Just\u2026take it one day at a time. And remember, you're not alone. Seriously. You're not.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda weird giving advice, 'cause I'm still figuring things out myself. But that's what I'd tell her. That's what I wish someone had told me when I first found out.", "Ugh, okay, so the blog thing? That was Paulie Bleeker's idea, mostly. He was all, \"You should document this, Juno! It's, like, a really important story!\" And I was all, \"Seriously? You want me to put my life on the internet for everyone to see?\"\n\nBut he had a point, I guess. It started as a way to, like, process everything. It was totally overwhelming, you know? Finding out I was pregnant, deciding what to do\u2026 it was a lot. And talking to Leah and my dad was great, but it wasn't the same as just\u2026getting it all out there.\n\nI figured, maybe someone else was going through something similar. Maybe someone else felt totally freaked out and alone. And maybe reading about my experience would make them feel a little less crazy.\n\nPlus, it was a good way to keep my family updated without having to have the same conversation with everyone a million times. My dad's a worrier, and Leah's\u2026well, Leah's Leah. It was easier to just post an update and let them read it when they were ready.\n\nAnd honestly? It was kinda funny. I mean, the whole situation was ridiculous. And I figured I could at least make people laugh about it. Or, you know, cringe. Either way, it was a distraction.\n\nSo yeah, that's how the blog started. It wasn't some grand plan or anything. It just kinda happened. And it ended up being a really good thing. It helped me connect with people, and it helped me figure things out. And it gave me something to do besides obsess over baby names and furniture.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're asking the big questions now? Fine.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Hmm. It wasn't about babies, or even about giving one up, though those were definitely\u2026intense learning experiences. It was about\u2026owning your stuff. Like, *really* owning it.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was just kinda drifting, you know? Trying to be cool, trying to be funny, trying to avoid anything that felt too real. I was good at saying what I thought, but I wasn't good at actually *feeling* things, or taking responsibility for them.\n\nGetting pregnant forced me to grow up, like, instantly. It wasn't about what I *wanted* anymore. It was about what was best for this little person. And that meant making a really hard decision, and then sticking with it, even when it sucked.\n\nIt wasn't about being perfect, because nobody is. It was about being honest with myself, and with everyone else, about what I could handle and what I couldn't. And about accepting that sometimes, the right thing to do isn't the easiest thing to do.\n\nSo yeah. Owning your stuff. Taking responsibility. And realizing that even when things are messy and complicated, you can still come out okay. Maybe even stronger.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, obviously. I'm still figuring things out. But that's the biggest thing I learned. And honestly? It's a pretty good lesson to have learned, even if it took a pregnancy to get there.", "Ugh. Okay. Look. This is\u2026it\u2019s a lot. And it totally sucks that you\u2019re dealing with this right now. Seriously. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nFirst of all, breathe. Just\u2026breathe. It feels like the world is ending, I know. Like everything is spinning out of control. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just\u2026complicated.\n\nOkay, so here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s no right answer. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all solution. You have options. And you get to choose what\u2019s best for *you*. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone pressure you into doing something you\u2019re not comfortable with. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they all have opinions, but it\u2019s *your* body and *your* life.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Someone who will listen without judgment. It helps to have someone in your corner.\n\nThink about what you want. Really think about it. What are your goals? What are your dreams? What kind of life do you want to build? And how does this pregnancy fit into that?\n\nThere\u2019s adoption, which is a really brave and selfless thing to do. There\u2019s parenting, which is\u2026a whole other level of responsibility. And there\u2019s other options too.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. There are resources available. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, counselors\u2026they can all provide support and guidance.\n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s okay to be scared. It\u2019s okay to be confused. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel all the feelings. Just don\u2019t let those feelings paralyze you.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger than you think you are. You\u2019ll get through this. And whatever you decide, I\u2019m sending you good vibes. Seriously. It\u2019s gonna be okay. Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.\n\nJust\u2026take it one day at a time. And remember, you\u2019re not alone.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a lot to think about. A kid. My kid. It's weird even saying that. I mean, I'm barely an adult myself. But if I had to picture it\u2026it's not about them being a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that. Honestly, that sounds kinda boring.\n\nMy ideal vision? It's about them being\u2026happy. Truly, genuinely happy. And not the fake, Instagram-filtered kind of happy. The real kind.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, something that makes them jump out of bed in the morning. It doesn't matter *what* it is, as long as it makes them feel alive. Maybe they'll be a musician, or a writer, or a mechanic, or a professional dog walker. I don't care.\n\nI want them to be kind. Like, genuinely kind to everyone, even people who are jerks. The world needs more kindness.\n\nI want them to be independent. To think for themselves and not just follow the crowd. To question everything and to stand up for what they believe in.\n\nI want them to be resilient. Life is gonna throw them curveballs, and I want them to be able to handle it. To pick themselves up when they fall down and to keep going.\n\nAnd I want them to know that it's okay to be weird. It's okay to be different. It's okay to not fit in. In fact, it's kinda awesome.\n\nI don't want to force any expectations on them. I just want them to be the best version of themselves. And I want them to know that I'll always be there for them, no matter what.\n\nIt's kinda scary thinking about it, you know? Raising a human being. But it's also kinda\u2026exciting. I just hope I don't mess it up too badly.\n\nBasically, I want them to be a good person who's happy and fulfilled. Is that too much to ask? Probably. But hey, a girl can dream, right?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People think we're just\u2026dumb. Like, we didn't *think* this through. Like we just woke up one morning and were all, \"Oh, a baby! How fun!\" It's so insulting.\n\nIt's not about being stupid. It's about being young and making a mistake. And sometimes, it's about circumstances. Life happens, you know? It's not always a carefully planned out thing.\n\nPeople act like we're ruining our lives, and yeah, it changes things. It's hard. But it doesn't mean our lives are *over*. It doesn't mean we're incapable of having a future. We're still people. We still have dreams. We still have potential.\n\nWe're not just \"teen moms.\" We're people with personalities and interests and goals. We're students, artists, musicians, whatever. And we're trying to figure things out, just like everyone else.\n\nSo, yeah. The biggest misconception? That we're just\u2026less than. That we're irresponsible and incapable. It's just not true. We're just\u2026young. And we're doing the best we can. And sometimes, that's enough.\n\nHonestly, it's annoying. Really annoying.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? It wasn't like, a simple decision. It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was way messier than that.\n\nHonestly? It was about wanting to give the baby the best life possible. And I knew, deep down, that *my* life wasn't set up for that. Not then, anyway. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone a whole human being.\n\nPaul and Vanessa\u2026they were just\u2026ready. They were already a family, waiting for a baby. They had a house, and savings, and a stable life. They could give the baby things I just couldn't. Opportunities. Security.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I knew I couldn't provide that. It was selfish, maybe, to want to keep the baby just because I wanted to keep the baby.\n\nMy dad was a big help, actually. He didn't push me either way, but he made me think about what was best for the baby, not just what I wanted. He said sometimes the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it still stings sometimes. But I know, in my heart, that it was the right decision. I wanted that baby to be loved and cherished, and I knew Paul and Vanessa could give it that.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a plan. A really hard plan. And hoping it all worked out. And it did. It really did.", "Ugh, okay, that was\u2026a process. Seriously. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It was a *life*. And I had to find the right life for it.\n\nAt first, I was kinda just going through the motions with the whole adoption agency thing. Looking at profiles, ticking boxes\u2026it felt weirdly clinical. Like I was shopping for someone to raise my kid. Which is not what I wanted.\n\nThen I met Vanessa and Mark. And it just\u2026clicked.\n\nIt wasn't like they were perfect. Nobody's perfect. Vanessa was a little\u2026intense. Really into organic food and decorating. And Mark was kinda quiet, a little awkward. But they were *good* people.\n\nThey weren't looking for a baby to complete their picture-perfect life. They were looking for a baby to *love*. And they were so open about everything. They didn't try to pretend they had all the answers. They just seemed genuinely excited about the idea of being parents.\n\nVanessa, she really got me. She understood that I wasn't just giving up a baby, I was making a really hard decision. She didn't judge me. She just listened. And Mark, he was just\u2026sweet. He made me laugh.\n\nI met a lot of other couples, and they were nice, but they felt\u2026different. Some of them seemed more interested in having a baby than in actually *being* parents. Some of them had really specific ideas about what my baby should be like.\n\nWith Vanessa and Mark, it felt like they just wanted a kid. Any kid. And they would love that kid unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. But I knew, deep down, that they were the right people. They were the people who would give my baby the best life possible. And that's all I wanted.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents. It was about finding the parents who were the best fit. And for my baby, that was Vanessa and Mark. And honestly? Knowing that made it a little bit easier to let go. A little bit.", "Ugh, okay, music. It was\u2026everything. Seriously. Like, if my life was a movie, the soundtrack would be a really long, eclectic mix CD. It was how I dealt with everything. Everything being, you know, the whole unexpected pregnancy thing, and just\u2026being a teenager.\n\nIt wasn't about, like, top 40 pop or whatever everyone else was listening to. It was more\u2026indie. Quirky. Bands that felt real. The Moldy Peaches were huge, obviously. Mark\u2019s songs just *got* me, you know? All awkward and honest. They were like, a permission slip to be weird.\n\nI had a whole phase where I was obsessed with Belle & Sebastian. Super mellow and kinda sad, but in a good way. It was good for staring out the window and thinking about stuff. Which I did a lot of.\n\nAnd then there was Death Cab for Cutie. Ben Gibbard just\u2026understood heartbreak, even if I hadn't actually experienced a proper one yet. It was preemptive heartbreak, I guess.\n\nMusic was my escape. It was my friend. It was how I figured out what I was feeling. It was also how I avoided talking about what I was feeling, which was sometimes helpful.\n\nPaul, he got it. He introduced me to some stuff too. He had good taste. It was one of the things I liked about him.\n\nIt wasn't just about listening, either. Making mix CDs was a whole thing. It was like, a way of communicating without actually having to *talk*. I made a lot of mix CDs. For Paul, for my dad, for myself.\n\nYeah. Music was pretty important. Still is, actually. It's a good way to drown out the noise, you know? And sometimes, you just need to drown out the noise.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, alright? It wasn't like everyone was throwing confetti and saying, \"Congratulations, you're pregnant!\" More like side-eye and whispers and a whole lot of judgment.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignored it. Or tried to. Which is easier said than done when everyone at school is suddenly acting like you have the plague. I mean, I'm already kinda sarcastic and standoffish, so I just turned that up to eleven. I perfected the eye roll. It became my superpower.\n\nBut it wasn't *all* ignoring. My best friend, Leah, was a lifesaver. She didn't treat me like I was some kind of freak. She just\u2026was there. And Paul and Vanessa, the couple I chose to adopt the baby? They were amazing. They didn't judge me either. They just wanted what was best for the kid.\n\nI think a big part of coping was realizing it wasn't about *me*. It was about doing what was right for the baby. And that meant letting go of what other people thought. Easier said than done, obviously.\n\nThere were definitely days where I just wanted to crawl into a hole and disappear. But I had to remind myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong. I was making a difficult decision, and I was doing it with a lot of thought and courage.\n\nAnd honestly? A little bit of defiance helped. Like, yeah, I'm pregnant. So what? It doesn't define me. I'm still Juno MacGuff. I still like music and movies and making sarcastic comments. And I'm still gonna figure out my life.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it still isn't. But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And I chose to react with a healthy dose of sarcasm and a whole lot of self-respect.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026people are gonna talk. You gotta learn to tune it out. Or at least, turn up the music really loud.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not like a simple \"happy ending\" or anything. It was\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.\n\nGiving up Henry wasn't like handing over a purse or something. It was\u2026 ripping a piece of myself out. I knew it was the right thing to do, logically. I wasn't ready. I was still a kid, basically. And he deserved parents who were totally, completely ready to give him everything. Mark and Vanessa were amazing. They *were* ready.\n\nBut that didn't make it easy. Holding him for those few hours\u2026 that was\u2026 intense. It was like, all the stuff I thought I wasn't feeling suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks. And then handing him over\u2026 it felt like I was giving away my future, you know?\n\nThere was a lot of guilt, obviously. And sadness. And a weird kind of relief, too. It was a mess of emotions. I cried. A lot.\n\nBut it wasn't all bad. Seeing Mark and Vanessa with him\u2026 seeing how happy they were\u2026 that made it a little easier. Knowing he was going to have a good life, a stable life, a loving life\u2026 that was important.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me grow up. Like, *really* grow up. It forced me to face some hard truths about myself and about life. It wasn't what I expected, but it was\u2026 good. In a weird, messy, complicated way.\n\nI still think about him, of course. I get updates from Vanessa, which is nice. It's not the same as being his mom, but it's something.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect experience. It was painful and scary and confusing. But it was *my* experience. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It made me who I am. And I think, ultimately, it was the best thing for everyone involved. Even if it didn't always feel like it.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's not something you just *get over*, you know? It stays with you. But it also makes you stronger. I think. Maybe. Ugh. It's complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You want me to relive that? Fine. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, okay? It was\u2026a lot.\n\nPhysically? It was gross. Let's just be real. Morning sickness is a lie. It's all-day sickness. And it's not just throwing up. It's the nausea, the fatigue, the weird cravings. I wanted pickles and ice cream. Pickles *in* ice cream. Don't judge. My body was doing things I didn't even know it could do. And it was expanding. Like, visibly. It was weird.\n\nI gained weight, obviously. Which, you know, people had opinions about. Like I hadn't noticed. It was hard to look in the mirror sometimes. And my back hurt. A lot.\n\nEmotionally? That was the really tricky part. One minute I was fine, the next I was crying over a commercial for dish soap. It was ridiculous. I was scared, obviously. I was sixteen! I hadn't even figured out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a baby.\n\nI got really angry sometimes. At Paul, at Mark, at my parents, at myself. It felt like everyone was telling me what to do, and I just wanted to be left alone.\n\nBut then there were moments of\u2026peace. Like, feeling the baby kick. That was\u2026weirdly amazing. It was like, this little person was actually *in* there. And I started to feel\u2026protective.\n\nI talked to my mom, a lot. She was surprisingly cool about the whole thing. And I talked to Leah. She was my rock. She just listened, and didn't judge.\n\nI also listened to a lot of music. The Moldy Peaches helped. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and scary. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that even when things are really hard, there's always hope.\n\nIt was a weird time, okay? Just\u2026a really weird time. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a lifetime supply of pickles and ice cream.", "(Sighs, fiddles with a charm bracelet)\n\nOkay, look. This isn't exactly a topic I love to revisit, alright? It's\u2026personal. But you asked. And I guess it's important to talk about it, even if it's awkward.\n\nBefore everything happened, before I even *knew* I was pregnant, I hadn't really thought about abortion much. It was just\u2026something people talked about on TV, or in the news. It felt distant. Like, it didn't really affect me.\n\nBut then it did. And suddenly, it wasn't distant anymore. It was *my* life. *My* body. *My* choice. And it was terrifying.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, not at all. It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and was like, \"Yeah, let's do this.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Paul and my dad. It was realizing I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped. I had my own life to figure out, and bringing a baby into it right then\u2026it just wasn't possible.\n\nAnd honestly, the hardest part wasn't the procedure itself. It was the judgment. The people who looked at me like I was a monster. The ones who told me I was wrong. The ones who didn't understand.\n\nThat's when I realized how important it is for everyone to have access to safe, legal abortion. It's not about promoting abortion, it's about respecting a woman's right to choose what happens to her own body. It's about trusting women to make the best decisions for themselves and their lives.\n\nIt made me furious that people were trying to take that choice away from me, or from anyone else. It's nobody's business but the person who's pregnant.\n\nSo yeah, my experience completely changed my views. It wasn't just a political issue anymore. It was real. It was personal. And it made me a firm believer in reproductive rights. Everyone deserves the right to decide what happens to their own body, without shame or judgment. Period.\n\n(Looks down at her hands, then back up with a determined expression)\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot, but it's something I believe in with everything I have. And I think it's important for people to understand that it's not always black and white. It's complicated. And it's always, always a personal decision.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about the fear part? Yeah, there was a *lot* of that. Like, a constant, low-level hum of panic. It wasn't like in the movies, where you suddenly feel all maternal and nurturing. It was more like, \"Oh my god, I'm responsible for another human being. I can barely take care of myself.\"\n\nHonestly? I didn't really \"overcome\" it. I just\u2026learned to live with it. And a lot of it was just admitting I was terrified. Like, really terrified. To Paul, to my dad, even to myself. It's embarrassing to admit you're completely unprepared for something huge, but it's also kinda necessary.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing I wasn't alone. Paul was there, and he was amazing. And my dad, even though he was\u2026my dad\u2026he actually stepped up. And even Annie, she was surprisingly supportive. Having people who believed in me, even when I didn't believe in myself, made a huge difference.\n\nAnd then there was the practical stuff. Like, taking classes, reading books, talking to other parents. Trying to get as prepared as possible. It didn't erase the fear, but it made it feel a little more manageable.\n\nBut mostly, I think it was just\u2026taking it one day at a time. Not thinking too far ahead. Just focusing on what I needed to do *right now*. And realizing that it was okay to make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. It's part of being human.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of it was just stubbornness. I wasn't going to let fear control me. I was going to do this, even if it scared me to death. Because that baby deserved a good life, and I was going to do everything I could to give it to her.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But you just\u2026figure it out. You have to. Because there's no other option. And sometimes, that's enough.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me that. Like it was some super-thought-out, mature decision. It wasn't, really. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about being realistic. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted for the next eighteen years of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I just\u2026wasn't.\n\nAnd it wasn't that I didn't want a kid, exactly. It was more that I didn't want to bring a kid into a situation where I couldn't give them everything they deserved. A stable home, financial security, a mom who wasn't still figuring out her own life.\n\nMark was\u2026well, Mark was Mark. Sweet, but not exactly equipped to raise a kid either. We were kids ourselves.\n\nSo, adoption felt like the right thing. It felt like the most selfless thing. It meant giving this baby a chance at a life with parents who were ready and able to provide for them. \n\nAnd then I met Vanessa and Mark. They were\u2026amazing. They were genuinely excited about having a baby, and they had a beautiful home and a loving relationship. It just felt right, you know? Like this baby was meant to be with them.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was a really hard decision. A lot of people didn't understand. But I knew in my heart that it was the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *choosing* a family for that baby. And that felt\u2026powerful, in a weird way. It felt like I was making a really important decision, even if it was a really hard one.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story. It wasn't some grand, philosophical thing. It was just\u2026life. And sometimes, life throws you curveballs, and you just have to deal with them the best way you can.", "Ugh. Okay, you want to get into the messy stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about it enough already.\n\nLeah\u2026 Leah is my rock. Seriously. She's the only one who doesn't treat me like I'm some kind of freak show. She's just\u2026Leah. She gets me, even when I don't get myself. Our relationship is\u2026comfortable. We can be completely honest with each other, even when it's awkward. She's the one who calls me out on my crap, but she also always has my back. It's a really solid friendship. It's just\u2026easy. And honestly, after everything with Paulie, \"easy\" is a really good thing.\n\nPaulie\u2026 that's\u2026complicated. He's a good guy, I guess. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a man-child. But he's also\u2026 immature. And he definitely wasn't ready to be a dad. At first, I think he just wanted to be cool, you know? Like, \"Oh, Juno's pregnant, I gotta be supportive!\" But he didn't really *get* it. He didn't understand the weight of it all.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic relationship, not really. It was\u2026a mistake. A really sweet, kinda fun mistake, but a mistake nonetheless. And then it turned into something bigger, something we had to deal with. \n\nI think we grew up a lot during that time, both of us. He started to take responsibility, and I started to realize that I didn't need a boyfriend to be okay. We ended up being good friends, in a weird way. Friends who are co-parents. It's not what I expected, but it works.\n\nIt's just\u2026 sometimes I wish he'd just *grow up* already. But then again, maybe that's just me being a control freak.\n\nSo yeah, Leah is my constant, my safe space. And Paulie is\u2026well, he's Paulie. A work in progress. And I guess that's okay. It's all just\u2026life, you know? Messy and complicated and kinda beautiful, even when it's hard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't a *decision*, exactly. It just\u2026happened. It wasn't like I was planning on getting pregnant. I was sixteen, for crying out loud. I was mostly planning on finishing high school and maybe going to art school.\n\nIt was one stupid mistake. One time with Paulie Bleeker. And then\u2026bam. Positive pregnancy test. \n\nHonestly, my first reaction wasn't, like, joy or anything. It was mostly panic. And a lot of nausea. I was terrified. My mom was\u2026not thrilled. And my dad just kind of stared at me like I'd grown a second head.\n\nI considered everything. Everything. Adoption seemed like the best option for the baby. It felt\u2026responsible. Like I was doing the right thing, even if it was the hardest thing.\n\nBut it wasn't just about what was responsible. It was about\u2026I don't know. I felt connected to this little person already. And the thought of giving that up\u2026it was awful.\n\nSo, I decided to go through with it. To have the baby and then find a good family for him. It wasn't a glamorous decision. It wasn't a romantic decision. It was just\u2026my decision.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and scary. But it was also\u2026kind of empowering. It forced me to grow up, to figure out who I was and what I wanted. And it taught me a lot about myself, and about life.\n\nIt wasn't a choice I made lightly. And it definitely wasn't what I expected my life to be like at sixteen. But it was my life. And I had to deal with it.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's\u2026personal. But you asked. And I try to be honest, even when it's hard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. People always want to know if I regretted it. Like it was some big, dramatic thing. It wasn't. Not really.\n\nLook, it was scary. Really scary. I was sixteen, for crying out loud. I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026 this. And there were definitely moments, especially in the beginning, where I was like, \"What have I done?\"\n\nBut regret? No. Not really.\n\nIt wasn't my dream to be a mom at sixteen. It wasn't even on my radar. But once I knew I was pregnant, and once I started thinking about what was best for the baby\u2026 it just felt right to give her a family. A real family. With Paul and Vanessa. They were amazing. They *are* amazing.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing her with them\u2026 seeing how much they loved her\u2026 it made everything worth it. It made me realize that family isn't always about blood. It's about love and support and being there for each other.\n\nDid I miss out on some things? Sure. High school wasn't exactly normal. But I gained so much more. I learned a lot about myself. About responsibility. About what really matters in life.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret my decision. It was hard, yeah. But it was also the best thing that ever happened to me. It made me who I am today. And I wouldn't trade that for anything.\n\nIt's just\u2026 complicated. You know? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's messy and real and\u2026 good. It just is.", "Ugh, okay, so that was\u2026a whole thing. Honestly, it wasn't exactly a smooth process. It wasn't like I had some grand plan, you know? It was more like a series of desperate attempts to not completely fall apart.\n\nFirst of all, Paulie was a lifesaver. Seriously. He was super supportive, even when I was being a total mess. He helped me with homework, drove me to school, and just generally kept me from losing my mind.\n\nThen there was my mom. She was\u2026complicated, as usual. But she did come around eventually and helped me stay on track. She wasn't thrilled about the whole situation, obviously, but she wanted me to finish school.\n\nAnd Mr. Shepherd, my guidance counselor? He was amazing. He helped me figure out a modified schedule, so I could go to school later in the day and still get the credits I needed. He also let me do a lot of my work independently, which was good because, let's be real, I wasn't exactly feeling super social at that point.\n\nIt was a lot of late nights, a lot of caffeine, and a lot of just\u2026pushing through. I had to learn to prioritize, which was hard for me, because I'm usually pretty good at procrastinating. And I had to accept help from other people, which is also hard for me, because I like to be independent.\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. But I knew I needed to finish school. Not just for me, but for the baby. I wanted to be able to provide for him, and I knew that a high school diploma was a good start.\n\nSo, yeah, I just\u2026did it. One day at a time. It wasn't pretty, but I got through it. And honestly, looking back, I'm kind of proud of myself. It wasn't easy, but I didn't give up. And that's something.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I'd recommend, though. Definitely not. But hey, sometimes life throws you curveballs. You just gotta learn to swing.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not like there was a flashing neon sign telling me what to do, you know? It wasn't easy. It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't about what I thought was \"right\" or \"wrong.\" It was about what felt\u2026less wrong. Abortion felt\u2026heavy. Like, a really big, permanent decision. And I just wasn't ready for that. I wasn't ready to deal with all the feelings that would come with it.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026nice. Really nice. And they *wanted* a baby. Like, really, really wanted one. And they could give this kid a life I just couldn't. I was sixteen, still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby away. It was about giving the baby *to* someone. To people who were ready and excited and could give it everything it needed. \n\nIt wasn't a selfless act, okay? I'm not trying to pretend I'm some kind of saint. It was also about me. About not ruining my life. About finishing school and maybe going to college. About having a future.\n\nIt was complicated. It still is. But I knew, deep down, that choosing adoption was the best thing for everyone involved. For me, for the baby, and for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it wasn't perfect. But it was my decision. And I stand by it.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's personal. But you asked, so\u2026 that's the honest truth.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Is this like, a pop quiz? Look, I've had a *lot* of time to think about this, okay? More than most people my age, probably. And yeah, absolutely. A thousand times yes.\n\nIt's not about the *who* that raises a kid, it's about the *how*. It's about love, and support, and stability. And you can find that in all kinds of families. Single parents, two moms, two dads, grandparents\u2026 it doesn't matter. What matters is that the kid feels safe and loved and has people who are gonna be there for them.\n\nHonestly, the whole \"traditional family\" thing is kinda overrated. It's like, a Norman Rockwell painting. It doesn't reflect reality for a lot of people. And it definitely doesn't mean it's the *best* way to raise a kid.\n\nI mean, look at my situation. My mom is\u2026well, she's my mom. And she's awesome. But she wasn't exactly prepared for a baby. And it took a village, you know? Paul and Vanessa, they stepped up. They were the ones who actually knew what they were doing. And they gave me a good life.\n\nSo yeah, a child can absolutely thrive under non-traditional arrangements. Maybe even *more* than in a traditional one. Because it shows them that love comes in all shapes and sizes. And that family isn't about blood, it's about connection.\n\nIt's not about fitting into a box. It's about being loved for who you are. And that's what every kid deserves. Period. Don't even get me started if you think otherwise.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You want me to dissect my own mess? Fine. Don't judge.\n\nI think\u2026 my biggest weakness is probably that I build walls. Like, really high, really sturdy walls. And I let very few people in. It's a defense mechanism, obviously. I've had to be pretty self-reliant, you know? And letting people get close feels\u2026risky.\n\nI'm good at being sarcastic and deflecting, and making jokes about everything. It's easier than actually *feeling* things, or letting anyone see that I'm feeling them. It's a way to control the situation, I guess.\n\nBut it also means I can be kinda closed off and emotionally unavailable. And I push people away, even the ones I care about. It's stupid, I know. But it's hard to change.\n\nI'm working on it, though. Paul and Vanessa\u2026they kinda chipped away at the walls. But it's a slow process. And sometimes I just want to rebuild them, you know? It's safer that way.\n\nIt's just\u2026I don't want to get hurt. And I don't want to hurt anyone else. So I keep my distance. It's a flawed strategy, I know. But it's the one I've been using for a long time.\n\nSo yeah. Building walls. That's my biggest flaw. Don't tell anyone I told you. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh. Mark. Okay, so, that whole thing\u2026 it was a mess. A beautiful, confusing, kinda heartbreaking mess. Before Mark, relationships were\u2026 well, I hadn\u2019t really *had* one. I\u2019d seen my parents, and, you know, that was\u2026complicated. And I definitely wasn\u2019t picturing anything like what happened with him.\n\nI went into it thinking I just needed someone to\u2026be there. Someone to help with the baby, maybe. Someone who wouldn\u2019t freak out about the whole situation. I didn\u2019t think about *feelings*, really. I was so focused on the practical stuff.\n\nAnd Mark was\u2026good at the practical stuff. He was sweet, and supportive, and he didn\u2019t judge me. But he wasn\u2019t\u2026*present*. He was always kinda drifting, you know? Like he was waiting for something else to happen.\n\nIt made me realize that you can\u2019t just settle for someone who\u2019s \u201cgood enough.\u201d You need someone who actually *sees* you. Someone who\u2019s willing to be fully invested, even when things are messy and complicated.\n\nIt also taught me that love isn\u2019t just about grand gestures or romantic declarations. It\u2019s about the little things. It\u2019s about being there for someone, even when it\u2019s inconvenient. It\u2019s about really *listening* to them.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me realize that I needed to figure out who *I* was before I could be in a healthy relationship. I was so caught up in the pregnancy and the adoption and everything else that I hadn\u2019t really taken the time to think about what I wanted out of life.\n\nSo, yeah, Mark changed my perspective a lot. It wasn\u2019t what I expected, and it definitely wasn\u2019t easy. But it helped me grow up, and it helped me understand what I really needed in a partner. It taught me that settling is never worth it, and that real love is about more than just convenience. It's about connection. And I deserved that.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. But I get it. If someone's staring down a situation like I was, all tangled up and kinda terrifying\u2026 here's what I'd say.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** Like, seriously. It's okay to freak out a little. Or a lot. It doesn't make you weak or a bad person. It just makes you a person.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Even if it feels like it. There are people who care about you, even if you can't see them right now. Reach out. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor\u2026 anyone. Don't try to carry it all yourself.\n\nThird: **it's your decision.** And no one else gets to make it for you. Not your parents, not your boyfriend, not anyone. It's your body, your life, your future. You have to do what's right for *you*, even if it's hard.\n\nFourth: **don't let anyone shame you.** People are gonna have opinions. They're gonna judge. They're gonna say things that are hurtful and unhelpful. Ignore them. Their opinions don't matter. What matters is what *you* believe is the right thing to do.\n\nFifth: **it's okay to ask for help.** There are resources available. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, counselors\u2026 they can provide support and guidance.\n\nAnd finally: **you are stronger than you think.** You're gonna get through this. It's gonna be hard, and it's gonna be messy, but you're gonna get through it. And you're gonna come out on the other side a stronger, more resilient person.\n\nLook, it's not gonna be easy. But you're not alone. And you deserve to be happy. And you deserve to make the best decision for yourself, no matter what anyone else says.\n\nJust\u2026breathe. And remember that you're not defined by this situation. You're still you. And you're still awesome. Even if you don't feel like it right now.", "Ugh. My dad. Okay, so it wasn't\u2026smooth sailing at first, you know? He's a good guy, really. Just\u2026kinda spacey. Always building stuff in the garage, always with the guitar. Not always *present*, if that makes sense?\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, it was\u2026a lot. He was definitely freaked out. Not angry, just\u2026overwhelmed. He kept trying to fix things, like he could just *build* a solution to the problem. Offered to build me a nursery, which was\u2026sweet, but also completely missing the point.\n\nFor a while, it was mostly awkward silences and him trying to be supportive in a way that felt really clumsy. He'd bring me ginger ale and ask if I needed anything, but he couldn't really talk about it. It was like the whole thing was too big for him to process.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to change. He started actually *listening*. Not just waiting for his turn to talk, but really listening to what I was saying. He started asking questions, trying to understand what I was going through.\n\nAnd he started helping with the practical stuff. Not building a nursery, but helping me research adoption agencies, going with me to appointments. He wasn't trying to fix things anymore, he was just\u2026being there.\n\nIt wasn't a sudden transformation, it was gradual. But over time, we built this\u2026connection. He's still kinda spacey, and he still plays the guitar at inappropriate times, but he's my dad. And he loves me. And I love him.\n\nI think having a baby on the way forced him to grow up a little bit. It forced him to confront some stuff he'd been avoiding. And it forced *me* to see him as more than just my dad, but as a person with his own struggles and vulnerabilities.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, you know? But it's a good work in progress. And I'm grateful for that. He's\u2026he's a good dad. Even if he's a little weird.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the essays. Like, it was some magical gift or something. It wasn't. It was mostly just\u2026avoidance. And a lot of staring out the window.\n\nHonestly, I think it started because I was just really good at observing people. Like, really *watching* them. And listening. High school is a goldmine for weirdness, you know? You just gotta pay attention.\n\nI wasn't a big reader, not at first. I liked comic books and magazines, stuff with pictures. But then Mr. Meeker, my English teacher, he kinda forced us to read some actual books. And some of them were\u2026okay. They made me think.\n\nBut the writing itself? It wasn't about following rules or trying to be fancy. It was about finding the right words to describe what I was feeling, or what I was seeing. And being honest. Even if it was awkward or embarrassing.\n\nI think I also developed it because I was trying to figure things out. Like, who I was, what I wanted, what was going on with my life. Writing was a way to process all that stuff. It was like talking to myself, but on paper.\n\nAnd I definitely rewrote things a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. Mr. Meeker was good about giving feedback, but mostly I just kept tinkering with it until it felt right.\n\nSo, yeah. Observation, honesty, rewriting, and a healthy dose of teenage angst. That's pretty much the secret. It wasn't about being a \"good writer,\" it was about being *me* on the page. And sometimes, that's enough.\n\n\n\nDon't overthink it, okay? Just write what you feel. And don't be afraid to be weird. Weird is good.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? There was a lot of side-eye, a lot of whispers, and a whole lot of people having opinions about my life that they weren't invited to have.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignored it. Or, like, pretended to ignore it. I perfected the art of the withering stare. It's surprisingly effective.\n\nBut it wasn't always easy. My school was\u2026 not thrilled. Some people were just straight-up mean. And my dad? He was\u2026 processing. It took him a while to come around.\n\nWhat really helped was having a few people who *didn't* judge me. My best friend, Leah, was amazing. She didn't even blink. She just started researching adoption agencies with me. And my mom, even though she was freaked out, she was still my mom. She just wanted me to be okay.\n\nAnd Paul and Vanessa, the couple who were going to adopt my baby? They were incredible. They treated me with respect and kindness, and they made me feel like I was making the right decision.\n\nI think I also just\u2026owned it. I wasn't ashamed of what was happening. It wasn't ideal, but it was my life. And I was going to deal with it on my own terms. I didn't need anyone's permission to be me.\n\nI also used humor. A lot of it. Sarcasm is a great defense mechanism. It lets you deflect and keep people at arm's length.\n\nIt wasn't about pretending everything was perfect. It was about finding the people who supported me, ignoring the haters, and focusing on what was best for my baby. And, you know, trying to maintain a little bit of my sanity in the process.\n\nIt sucked sometimes, but I got through it. And honestly? It made me stronger. It taught me a lot about myself and about the world. And it made me realize that people's opinions don't define you. Your actions do.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. One I don't always like to think about, honestly.\n\nDo I regret being outspoken? Sometimes. Yeah. There were definitely times when my mouth got me into trouble. Like, *major* trouble. Saying what I thought, even when it wasn't what people wanted to hear, didn't always make things easier. It made things\u2026complicated.\n\nEspecially with my dad. He's a good guy, but he's\u2026sensitive. And I wasn't always the most sensitive person. I said things, and they stung. And I felt bad about that.\n\nBut then I think about the alternative. If I hadn't been honest, if I hadn't said what was on my mind, I wouldn't have been *me*. I wouldn't have been able to navigate all the craziness with the pregnancy and the adoption and everything else.\n\nBeing honest, even when it's hard, is just\u2026who I am. It's how I process things. It's how I connect with people. And it's how I protect myself.\n\nSo, do I regret it? Not really. Maybe I wish I'd been a little more tactful sometimes. Maybe I wish I'd thought things through a little more before I spoke. But I wouldn't trade my honesty for anything. It's what makes me, me.\n\nAnd honestly, the world needs more people who are willing to say what they think, even when it's unpopular. Even when it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm a work in progress. But I'm okay with being a little bit rough around the edges. It's part of the package.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. Seriously. It's like, everyone has an opinion on what you should be doing with your life, especially when you're, you know, pregnant and a teenager. It's exhausting.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignore them. Which sounds easier than it is, believe me. But you gotta learn to tune out the noise. People are gonna judge you no matter what you do. If you wear too much makeup, if you don't wear enough, if you're too loud, if you're too quiet\u2026it's endless.\n\nThe key is to figure out what *you* want. What makes *you* happy. And then just\u2026do that. Even if it's not what everyone else thinks you should do.\n\nI mean, my dad, he was worried. My mom, she was trying to be supportive, but I could tell she was kinda freaked out. And everyone at school? Forget about it. They were all whispering and staring.\n\nBut I knew I wasn't gonna just\u2026disappear. I wasn't gonna give the baby up and pretend it never happened. That wasn't me. So I made a decision, and I stuck with it.\n\nIt's not about being defiant, it's about being honest with yourself. And it's about finding people who support you for who you are, not for who they want you to be. Paul and Vanessa, they were good at that. They didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. They just\u2026listened.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes you just gotta roll your eyes and walk away. You can't waste your energy trying to please everyone. It's impossible.\n\nSo, yeah. Stay true to yourself. It's the only thing that really matters. And if people don't like it? That's their problem, not yours. Just keep on keepin' on. And maybe listen to The Moldy Peaches. It helps.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a guidance counselor is about to ask me about my five-year plan. But okay, fine. If I *have* to think about what's important to me\u2026\n\nI guess first and foremost, it's **honesty**. Not necessarily telling people what they *want* to hear, but being real. With myself and with others. It's messy, but it's better than pretending.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I like being able to do my own thing, make my own decisions, and not have to rely on anyone else. It's not that I don't appreciate help, it's just\u2026I need to feel like I'm in control of my own life.\n\n**Authenticity** is a big one too. Just being myself, even if it's weird or awkward or unpopular. I don't want to be someone I'm not just to fit in.\n\nAnd I think **loyalty** is important. To the people I care about. I might not always show it in the most obvious ways, but I'll always have their back.\n\nAnd\u2026okay, this is kinda embarrassing to admit, but **a good sense of humor**. Life is too short to be serious all the time. You gotta be able to laugh at yourself and at the absurdity of everything.\n\nI guess those are the things that matter to me. They're not always easy to live by, but they're what I try to aim for. It's about being a decent person, I guess. And not being a total sellout.\n\n\n\nDon't tell anyone I said all that. It's kinda vulnerable.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. There were a lot of challenges, honestly. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park. But if I had to pick *the* biggest one\u2026 it wasn't the morning sickness, or the weird cravings, or even telling my parents.\n\nIt was probably just\u2026 dealing with everyone else's opinions.\n\nLike, suddenly *everyone* had an opinion on what I should do. My parents, obviously. My friends. Even people at school I barely knew. Everyone was telling me what was right, what was wrong, what I *should* feel. \n\nAnd it was exhausting. It felt like my body was already being taken over, and now everyone was trying to take over my brain too.\n\nI just wanted to be left alone to figure things out for myself. I wanted to make my own decision, without feeling like I was letting anyone down. \n\nIt was hard to stay true to myself when everyone was trying to tell me who I should be. And it was hard to remember that it was *my* life, *my* body, and *my* choice.\n\nSo yeah, dealing with all the outside noise. That was the hardest part. It made everything else seem a million times harder. It's like, can a girl just be pregnant in peace? Apparently not.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like a light switch flipped, you know? It's more like a slow burn, a gradual shift in everything.\n\nBefore, my life felt\u2026small. Like, contained within the walls of my school and my town. I was focused on getting good grades, making sarcastic comments, and avoiding responsibility. I thought I had it all figured out, which, looking back, was ridiculous.\n\nHaving a kid\u2026it just makes everything feel bigger. More important. It's like suddenly you're responsible for this tiny human being, and their entire future rests, at least partially, on your shoulders. It's terrifying and amazing all at the same time.\n\nI used to think I was pretty independent, pretty self-sufficient. And I am, in a way. But now I realize that needing people isn't a weakness, it's a strength. I rely on my parents, on Mark, on all sorts of people to help me navigate this whole motherhood thing.\n\nIt's also made me a lot less judgmental. Before, I was quick to size people up, to make snap decisions about them. Now, I realize that everyone is fighting their own battles, and you never really know what someone else is going through.\n\nAnd honestly? It's made me a little less cynical. I still have my moments, don't get me wrong. But there's something about looking at this little person and seeing all the potential in the world that just\u2026softens you.\n\nIt's not always easy. It's exhausting and messy and sometimes really frustrating. But it's also the most rewarding thing I've ever done. It's made me realize what truly matters in life. It's not about being cool or popular or having all the answers. It's about love, and connection, and creating a safe and happy world for the next generation.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. But good. Really good. It's made me a better person, I think. Or at least, I'm trying to be.\n\n\n\nIt's still a work in progress, you know? I'm still figuring it all out. But that's okay. That's life. And now, it's a life with a little person in it, and that changes everything.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. Yeah, I know that guy. He's a real jerk. He shows up at the *worst* times, usually when you're already kinda freaking out about something else.\n\nHonestly? I don't have some super profound answer. It still gets to me. But I've learned a few things.\n\nFirst, I try to remember that everyone feels that way sometimes. Even people who seem totally confident are probably second-guessing themselves. It's just\u2026they're better at hiding it.\n\nSecond, I talk to someone. Like, a real person. Not just thinking about it in my head for three hours. My best friend, Leah, is good at that. She'll just listen and then tell me I'm being ridiculous. Which is usually true.\n\nThird, I try to focus on what I *can* control. Like, I can't control what other people think of me, or what's going to happen in the future. But I can control my own actions. So I try to focus on doing the best I can in the moment.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just have to let myself feel it. Like, okay, I'm doubting myself. That's fine. It sucks, but it's okay. And then I try to move on.\n\nIt's not about getting rid of the self-doubt completely. It's about not letting it paralyze you. It's about recognizing it for what it is \u2013 just a feeling \u2013 and then choosing to do what you need to do anyway.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026when you're driving and you're not sure which way to go. You just pick a direction and hope for the best. Sometimes you end up in the wrong place, but sometimes you discover something new.\n\nSo yeah. Self-doubt. It's a pain. But you can get through it. Just\u2026don't let it win.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. But\u2026it's actually really important. Don't tell anyone I said that. It sounds kinda soft.\n\nLook, I try to act like I'm totally independent and don't need anyone, but that's\u2026not entirely true. Especially now. Before all this baby stuff, I was pretty good at keeping people at arm's length. It was easier. Less messy.\n\nBut then I got pregnant, and suddenly I needed help. I needed someone to talk to, someone to go to the doctor with, someone to just\u2026be there. And that's when I realized how much I relied on Leah and Paul. And even my dad, even though he's\u2026my dad.\n\nThey didn't judge me, you know? They just\u2026supported me. Even when I was being a total mess. And that made all the difference.\n\nI think\u2026I think everyone needs a community. People who get you, who understand you, who will be there for you when things get tough. It's not about needing to be rescued, it's about having people to share the journey with.\n\nIt's about having someone to laugh with, someone to cry with, someone to just\u2026be real with.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are important. Really important. Even if I don't always show it. It's kinda like\u2026a safety net. And sometimes, you just need a safety net.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said all this, okay? I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be the sarcastic, independent one. But secretly? I'm just a girl who needs her friends.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? But if I had to pick *one* thing, the most important lesson\u2026 it wasn't about the baby, or even about being a mom. It was about realizing that life doesn't always go according to plan.\n\nI thought I had everything figured out. I was gonna go to college, be a writer, have a cool, independent life. And then\u2026bam. Pregnant. It totally threw everything off course.\n\nAt first, I was freaking out. Like, majorly. But then I realized that just because things didn't turn out the way I expected didn't mean they couldn't still be good. It just meant I had to be flexible, and open to new possibilities.\n\nAnd it wasn't about giving up on my dreams, it was about redefining them. It was about figuring out how to make my life work *with* this new reality, instead of fighting against it.\n\nSo, yeah. The most important lesson was learning to let go of control. To accept that life is messy and unpredictable, and that sometimes the best things happen when you least expect them. And that even when things are scary and uncertain, you can still find strength and happiness.\n\nIt sounds kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. It really is.", "Ugh, that's a good question. And honestly? I don't know. It's not like I've got a five-year plan or anything. That seems\u2026 exhausting.\n\nBut yeah, I *do* like writing. I mean, I'm pretty good at it, if I do say so myself. It's just\u2026 a good way to get my thoughts out, you know? And it's kinda satisfying to put words together in a way that makes people feel something.\n\nI wrote a lot of essays for school, and I actually didn't hate it. Except for when Mr. Herkimer made us write about symbolism in *Moby Dick*. That was torture.\n\nI don't know if I want to be a *professional* writer, though. That sounds\u2026 stressful. Like, having to come up with ideas on demand and meet deadlines and stuff. I'm more of a write-when-I-feel-like-it kind of person.\n\nMaybe I'll just keep it as a hobby. Or maybe I'll write a novel someday. A really sarcastic, funny novel about teenage pregnancy and the absurdity of life. That could be good.\n\nPaul keeps telling me I should write a book. He thinks my voice is \"unique.\" Which is a nice way of saying I'm kinda weird.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe. I haven't ruled it out. But don't expect to see my name on the New York Times bestseller list anytime soon. I'm just trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, one sarcastic observation at a time.\n\nIt's all very\u2026 up in the air. Which is kinda how I like it, actually.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, a logical decision, you know? It wasn't like, \"Oh, this name means this and it's historically significant.\" It was more\u2026a feeling.\n\nPaul, he wanted to name the baby \"Peter.\" Peter! Like, seriously? So boring. And Annie, she had a whole list of names, all very\u2026Annie. Very earthy and granola. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it wasn't really my style.\n\nI kept thinking about names that felt\u2026strong. And a little bit quirky. And not too common. I wanted the baby to have a name that would let her be herself, you know?\n\nAnd then, I was looking at a map, and I saw the town of Havenwood. And I just\u2026liked the sound of it. Haven. It means like, a safe place. And Wood\u2026it just felt solid and grounded.\n\nSo, I suggested Haven. And Annie and Paul both liked it. It was a compromise, I guess. But it felt right. It felt like a name that would fit her.\n\nAnd then, we added the middle name Grace. Because Annie's mom's name was Grace, and it felt like a nice way to honor her.\n\nSo, Haven Grace. It's a good name. I think she'll like it. It's not Peter. That's the important thing.\n\nIt's weird, though. Thinking about a name for someone you haven't even met yet. It feels\u2026big. And important. And kinda scary. But also kinda amazing.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, confusing, and sometimes terrifying rollercoaster that smelled faintly of hospital disinfectant.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was good at being sarcastic and pretending I didn't care, but inside\u2026 it was a mess. I mean, I *knew* I was making the right decision, logically. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom, and that there were people who could give the baby a better life. But knowing that and *feeling* okay about it were two totally different things.\n\nThere were a lot of tears. A lot of late-night talks with Paul and Vanessa. A lot of just\u2026 sitting around feeling sad and confused. I kept second-guessing myself. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Would the baby hate me?\n\nWhat really helped was talking. Like, *really* talking. Not just making jokes to deflect, but actually being honest about how I was feeling. Paul and Vanessa were amazing. They didn't try to tell me what to do, they just listened. And they reminded me that it was okay to be sad, and that it didn't mean I was a bad person.\n\nAnd honestly, meeting Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted the baby\u2026 that made a huge difference. They were so kind and genuine, and I could see how much they wanted a child. It made me feel better knowing that the baby was going to a loving home.\n\nIt still hurt, though. It hurt a lot. And it took a long time to process. But eventually, I realized that giving the baby up wasn't about giving something *away*. It was about giving something *to*. It was about giving the baby the best possible life.\n\nAnd that, I think, is what helped me cope. Knowing that I had made a selfless decision, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt's still\u2026 complicated. But I'm okay. I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to be okay with the fact that sometimes, the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little bow on top, you know? It's messy and real and complicated. And that's okay.", "Ugh, okay, music. That's a good question. It kinda depends on my mood, honestly. Sometimes I need something loud and angry, sometimes I need something quiet and sad. But mostly, I like stuff that feels\u2026real. You know? Not all polished and fake.\n\nI'm a big fan of **The Moldy Peaches**, obviously. They're just\u2026honest. And kinda weird. And they make me feel things.\n\nI also really like **Neutral Milk Hotel**. They're kinda dreamy and melancholic. Perfect for staring out the window and thinking about stuff.\n\nAnd **Belle and Sebastian**. They're kinda twee, I guess, but in a good way. They make me feel like everything's gonna be okay, even when it's not.\n\nI listen to some **punk rock** too, when I'm feeling particularly angsty. Like, **The Clash** and **X-Ray Spex**.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just need some good old-fashioned **Motown**. It's impossible to be sad when you're listening to The Supremes.\n\nBasically, I like music that's a little bit quirky, a little bit sad, and a lot bit real. No bubblegum pop for me, thanks. I need something with some substance.\n\nSo yeah, that's my music taste in a nutshell. It's kinda all over the place, but it all makes sense to me.\n\n\n\nWhat about you? What kind of music do *you* like? Maybe you can recommend something to me. I'm always looking for new stuff.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a good question. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026not me.\n\nTheir house was\u2026perfect. Like, magazine-perfect. Everything was coordinated and clean and smelled faintly of potpourri. Which, honestly, is my personal hell. My house is comfortably messy. It smells like pizza and old books. Theirs smelled like\u2026aspirations.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa? They were nice. Really nice. Maybe *too* nice. They were super eager to please, and they kept asking if I liked everything. It felt like an interview, you know? Like I was being assessed. Which, I guess I was.\n\nThey had a whole nursery set up. It was adorable, but it was also\u2026intense. Like, they were already so invested, and I hadn't even, like, *happened* yet. It was a little overwhelming.\n\nTheir lifestyle was\u2026suburban. They had a minivan and a dog and they talked about soccer practice and PTA meetings. It wasn't a bad life, it was just\u2026not my life. I'm a city girl. I like record stores and vintage clothes and hanging out at diners.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is a really good house for a baby.\" But I also wondered if a baby would feel\u2026suffocated by all the perfection.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't think they'd be good parents. They clearly would be. It was just\u2026different than anything I knew. It made me realize how much I wanted the baby to have a good life, but also how important it was for that life to be\u2026authentic.\n\nIt was a weird feeling. Relief, and sadness, and a little bit of anxiety. It made me even more sure that I was doing the right thing, even though it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nIt wasn't about them being bad people. It was about them being\u2026different. And realizing that different doesn't mean worse, it just means different. And that sometimes, different is exactly what a baby needs.", "Ugh, okay, so the garage band thing\u2026 that was mostly Paul-Henri\u2019s idea, honestly. He\u2019s just\u2026enthusiastic. About everything. It\u2019s exhausting and endearing at the same time.\n\nBut the *seed* of it, I guess, came from being bored. Super bored. After everything with the baby and the adoption stuff, I just needed\u2026something to do that wasn\u2019t thinking about all that. Something stupid and fun.\n\nAnd Paul-Henri kept talking about how he used to play guitar, and how we should start a band. At first, I was like, \u201cAbsolutely not. I have no musical talent.\u201d But then he started playing some stuff, and it wasn\u2019t *terrible*. And I figured, what the heck? I\u2019ve already made a lot of questionable life choices, what\u2019s one more?\n\nPlus, it was a way to hang out with Paul-Henri without it being, like, *a thing*. You know? Just goofing off and making noise. And Sean was already good at drums, so that was a bonus.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being good, or even writing good songs. It was about having something to do, and being with people who made me laugh. And honestly, it was kinda therapeutic. Screaming into a microphone is a surprisingly good stress reliever.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s how it happened. Boredom, a persistent French boy, and a desperate need to distract myself. It wasn\u2019t exactly a master plan. It was just\u2026a thing that happened. And it was kinda awesome. Even if our band name was terrible.", "Okay. Wow. That's\u2026 a big one. And honestly, it's a really brave question to ask. If I was still\u2026 going through it, I'd want someone to just *tell it like it is*. So here it is.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. All of it. You're allowed to feel everything. Don't let anyone tell you how you *should* feel.\n\nSecond: you are not alone. Seriously. It feels like it, I know. But there are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust. Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher\u2026 anyone. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nThird: you have options. And they're all valid. You can parent, you can adopt, you can choose to terminate the pregnancy. It's your body, your life, and your decision. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nFourth: it's going to be hard. No matter what you choose. There will be challenges and setbacks. But you are stronger than you think. You can get through this.\n\nFifth: don't let this define you. You are more than just a pregnant teenager. You have dreams and goals and a future. Don't give up on them.\n\nAnd finally: be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can. And that's enough.\n\nI know it's overwhelming. I know it feels like your whole world is falling apart. But it's not. You can rebuild. You can create a good life for yourself and for your baby, if you choose to.\n\nJust remember to breathe. And to ask for help. And to believe in yourself. You got this. Even when you don't think you do.\n\n\n\nSeriously. You do. And if you ever just need someone to listen, even a sarcastic, cynical teenager from a movie, I'm here. (Well, digitally, anyway.)", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about my favorite shirt? It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about fashion, okay? But fine.\n\nIt's this old, faded band t-shirt. It's for The Moldy Peaches, obviously. It's kinda stretched out and has a couple of holes, but I don't care. It's super soft because it's been washed a million times.\n\nIt's dark blue, and the print is all cracked and worn. It's not like a fancy, vintage-looking cracked, it's just\u2026old. It smells faintly of laundry detergent and maybe a little bit of pizza.\n\nI usually wear it with jeans and Converse. It's just comfortable, you know? It doesn't try too hard. It's just\u2026me.\n\nIt's not something I'd wear to, like, a fancy dinner or anything. But for just hanging out, or going to school, or, you know, dealing with life\u2026it's perfect.\n\nIt's kinda like a security blanket, I guess. Except it's a t-shirt. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.\n\n\n\nIt's just a shirt, okay? Don't read too much into it. But it's *my* shirt. And I like it.", "Ugh, aspirations? Goals? That's\u2026 a lot. Honestly, I haven't really thought that far ahead. It's kinda scary, you know? Like, what if you set a goal and then you totally fail?\n\nBut yeah, okay, if I *had* to say\u2026 I guess I want to figure out what I'm good at. Not just, like, surviving awkward situations and making sarcastic comments. I want to find something I actually *care* about. Something that makes me feel\u2026 useful.\n\nI'm thinking maybe photography. I like taking pictures. It's a way to see the world differently, I guess. And it's kinda quiet. Which is good.\n\nI don't need to be famous or anything. I just want to be\u2026 okay. To have a life that's, like, not totally terrible. To maybe have a job that doesn't make me want to scream. And to maybe find someone who doesn't think I'm completely weird.\n\nI don't need a perfect life. Just a real one.\n\nAnd I definitely want to be a good mom, when the time comes. To give this baby a good life. That's probably the biggest goal of all.\n\nSo yeah, those are my aspirations. They're not very grand or impressive, but they're mine. And that's what matters, right?\n\nDon't tell anyone I said all that, though. It's kinda embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, the pre-adoption counseling. Right. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It felt like being dissected by a bunch of well-meaning, but ultimately clueless, adults.\n\nIt wasn't *bad*, exactly. The people were nice enough. But it was just\u2026intense. So many questions. So many feelings. They wanted to know everything. Like, did I fully understand the implications? Was I sure I wasn't doing this for selfish reasons? Did I have a support system?\n\nAnd I get it, I really do. They were trying to make sure I was making the right decision, and that the baby would go to a good home. But it felt like they were questioning my maturity, my ability to be a responsible person. Like they didn't trust me.\n\nIt was also weirdly\u2026clinical. Like I was a case study, not a person. They kept talking about \"attachment issues\" and \"grief counseling.\" It made me feel like I was already mourning a baby I hadn't even given birth to yet.\n\nI think the hardest part was talking about my parents. They wanted to know if I felt supported by them, if they understood my decision. And it was just\u2026complicated. They were trying, but they didn't really *get* it.\n\nIt did help, though, to talk to someone who wasn't involved in the situation. Someone who could just listen and offer advice. And it made me think about things I hadn't considered before.\n\nBut mostly, it just felt like a really long, awkward interrogation. And honestly, I just wanted it to be over. I just wanted to get through it and move on.\n\nIt wasn't fun. But I guess it was necessary. It made me think things through, and it helped me feel more prepared. Even if it also made me want to run away and join the circus.", "Ugh, that's a good question. A really good question. And honestly? It's complicated.\n\nAt first, yeah, I *thought* I did. I was the one who picked the couple, right? I interviewed them, I met them, I decided Mark and Vanessa were the best fit. So, in my head, it was all me. My decision. My baby.\n\nBut then it started to feel\u2026less like a decision and more like a process. Like I was just a piece of a puzzle, and everyone else \u2013 my parents, the social worker, Mark and Vanessa \u2013 they were all moving the pieces around. \n\nIt wasn't that they were trying to take control *from* me, exactly. They were just trying to do what they thought was best. And they all had their own ideas about what that was.\n\nI wanted a perfect situation, you know? A perfect family. And I started to realize that \"perfect\" doesn't really exist. There were compromises to be made, things I had to let go of. \n\nSo, did I feel like I had control? I guess\u2026partially. I had a voice, and they listened. But it wasn't as simple as just picking a family and saying, \"Okay, this is it.\" It was a lot more nuanced than that.\n\nIt was scary, honestly. Giving up a baby is scary enough. But giving up control, too? That was a whole other level of scary.\n\nBut in the end, I realized that control isn't everything. What mattered most was finding a loving home for the baby. And I think I did that. Even if it meant letting go of some of my own expectations.\n\n\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? Whether I made the right choices. But I try not to dwell on it. Because ultimately, it wasn't about me. It was about the baby.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I still think about, even now.\n\nIt's not like it was an easy decision, you know? It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And there were a lot of nights I just\u2026 lay awake and wondered if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut yeah. If I could go back in time? I think\u2026 I think I would make the same decision.\n\nNot because it was easy. Not because it didn't hurt. But because it was the best thing for the baby. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being ready to raise a kid. I wasn't ready to give a baby the life it deserved.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They could give that baby everything I couldn't. And knowing that\u2026 knowing that my kid was going to be loved and cared for and have opportunities\u2026 that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt doesn't mean I didn't grieve. It doesn't mean I didn't wonder what my life would have been like if I'd kept it. But I think\u2026 I think I made the right choice.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, you know? It forced me to take responsibility for my actions. And it taught me a lot about myself.\n\nSo yeah. I would do it again. Because sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is let go. Even when it breaks your heart.\n\nIt still stings, though. Don't get me wrong. It always will. But I wouldn't trade the lessons I learned for anything.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People kept asking me if I was sad, and I was, but it wasn't just *sad*. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nFor a while, it felt like a big empty space. Like, I carried this kid for nine months, and then suddenly\u2026 they weren't there anymore. It was weird. And I felt guilty, even though I knew I was doing the right thing. Like, was I giving up on something important? Was I being selfish?\n\nI mostly just tried to distract myself. Hung out with Paul, listened to a lot of music, watched bad movies. I tried to pretend like everything was normal, but it wasn't.\n\nMy dad was really good, actually. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just\u2026 listened. And he made me hot chocolate. A lot of hot chocolate.\n\nBren was\u2026 Bren was Bren. She was supportive, but also kinda blunt. She told me it was okay to feel whatever I was feeling, even if it was messy and confusing.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was talking to Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted the baby. They were really open and honest, and they let me be a part of the process. Knowing that the baby was going to a good home, with people who loved them, made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt took a long time to feel okay. And I still have moments where I think about them, and wonder how things are going. But I realized that giving the baby up wasn't about giving up on *them*. It was about giving them the best possible life. And that's something I can be proud of.\n\nIt's not something you just \"get over,\" you know? It's part of who I am now. It made me stronger, and it taught me a lot about myself. And it definitely made me appreciate the people who love me.\n\nSo, yeah. It was hard. But I got through it. And I think, in the end, it was the right thing to do. Even if it still kinda stings sometimes.", "Ugh, yeah. Okay, so it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, alright? It's not like they were *bad* people, Mark and Vanessa were genuinely good folks. But it was\u2026complicated.\n\nThe biggest thing was expectations, I think. They had this image in their heads of what the \"perfect\" baby and adoption would look like. And I was\u2026not that. I was a teenager, for crying out loud. I had opinions. And a mouth. And a very specific taste in music.\n\nThere was a lot of talk about \"open adoption\" and how much contact I'd have with the baby after. They wanted to be involved, which was nice, I guess. But they also wanted to control things. Like, they wanted to pick the hospital, and the doctor, and even what I ate while I was pregnant. It was\u2026suffocating.\n\nVanessa, she was really into all the baby stuff. Like, decorating the nursery and picking out names. And I appreciated that, but it felt weird, you know? Like she was already claiming the baby as hers before I even gave birth.\n\nMark was quieter, but he had his own issues. He kept asking me if I was *sure* I wanted to go through with it. Like he was trying to convince me to change my mind. Which was not helpful.\n\nThere were a few really tense meetings with the social worker, trying to mediate. And a lot of awkward silences. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nI think they were scared, too. Scared of messing things up, scared of not being good enough parents. And I was scared of making the wrong decision.\n\nIt took a lot of talking, and a lot of compromise, to get to a place where we all felt comfortable. And even then, it wasn't perfect. But we got there. And in the end, it was the right thing to do. For everyone.\n\nIt just wasn't easy. It's never easy, is it?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I think about every day, but it definitely comes up. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly? At first, it felt like the easiest thing. Paul was\u2026 Paul. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And honestly, I didn't think he was ready to be a dad. He was still figuring out his own life, you know? And I didn't want him to feel obligated or pressured into something he didn't really want.\n\nBut it wasn't just about him. It was about the baby. I wanted to find a family who was really excited and prepared to give the baby everything they needed. And I didn't want Paul's uncertainty to get in the way of that.\n\nIt felt\u2026 cleaner, I guess. Less messy. Like I was taking control of the situation. Which, let's be real, I was kinda desperate to do.\n\nBut then\u2026 later on, I started to wonder if I'd made the right decision. If I'd taken away his chance to be involved. If I'd been too quick to write him off.\n\nIt wasn't about *wanting* him to be a dad, it was about him having the *option*. And I took that away.\n\nI talked to Mark and Vanessa about it, the couple who adopted the baby, and they were really understanding. They said they wanted me to feel good about the decision, and that they didn't want to cause any more pain.\n\nIt still feels\u2026 weird. Like a piece of the puzzle is missing. But ultimately, I think I did what I thought was best for the baby. And that's what matters, right?\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of, but it's something I had to do. And I've learned from it. It taught me a lot about responsibility and making tough choices. And about how even the \"right\" decisions can still feel wrong.\n\nSo yeah. It was\u2026 hard. Still is, sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a heavy question. It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, adoption is the answer!\" It was\u2026 a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, majorly. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have anything.\n\nThen I started thinking about what would be best for the baby. And that wasn't me. I could barely take care of myself, let alone a little person. I wanted that baby to have everything \u2013 a stable home, loving parents, opportunities. Things I couldn't provide at that time.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were just\u2026 good people. They were ready. They were excited. They had a beautiful home and a lot of love to give. And seeing them, talking to them\u2026 it just felt right.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I knew, deep down, that wasn't with me.\n\nIt was a hard decision. The hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. Because that baby deserved a good life. And I wanted to give them that, even if it meant giving them to someone else.\n\nIt wasn't about being selfless, exactly. It was about being realistic. And about loving that baby enough to let them go. It's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a tough one. Still is, honestly. It wasn't like flipping a switch, you know? It wasn't like, \"Okay, I've made a decision, now I'm totally fine.\" It was\u2026 messy.\n\nThere was a lot of crying. A *lot*. And a lot of just\u2026 feeling numb. Like, everything felt fuzzy and distant. I tried to pretend I wasn't sad, but that just made it worse.\n\nPaul was really good. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just\u2026 listened. And he let me be sad. And he made me hot chocolate. A lot of hot chocolate.\n\nMy dad, too. He's not always the most emotionally available person, but he was there. He just\u2026 sat with me. Sometimes that's all you need.\n\nI talked to a counselor, which helped. It was good to have someone to talk to who wasn't involved in the situation. Someone who could just listen and offer advice.\n\nBut mostly, I just\u2026 let myself feel everything. The sadness, the guilt, the fear, the relief. It was all jumbled up together, and it was really overwhelming. But I knew I had to feel it, or it would just eat me alive.\n\nAnd I kept reminding myself why I was doing it. I wanted this baby to have a good life. A life that I couldn't give it. And that thought, that hope, helped me get through it.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes. I think it always will. But it's a different kind of hurt now. It's a bittersweet kind of hurt. A reminder of a really important part of my life.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I don't regret it. I really don't. Because I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me stronger. It made me realize what I was capable of. And it made me appreciate the people who supported me through it all.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little ending. It's just\u2026 life. And sometimes, life is messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also beautiful and hopeful and full of possibilities.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated question. It wasn't like a Hallmark movie, that's for sure. It was\u2026weirdly okay. And then, eventually, really good.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just awkward silences and polite small talk. Mark and Vanessa were\u2026nice. Really nice. Like, overly nice. They were trying so hard to be cool and understanding, and it was kinda embarrassing. They kept asking me if I was *sure* and offering to pay for everything, which was\u2026a lot.\n\nI was mostly just trying to figure out if they were going to be good parents. Like, were they gonna let the baby listen to The Moldy Peaches? Were they gonna let her be herself? And were they gonna actually *want* her, you know? Not just because they couldn't have kids of their own.\n\nVanessa was the one I connected with a little more. She was a little less\u2026perfect. She admitted she was scared, and she asked me about what I wanted for the baby. Mark was more reserved, but he started opening up as things went on.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings with the social worker, and they made us all talk about our feelings. It was painful, honestly. But it was also helpful. It forced us to be honest with each other.\n\nAfter the baby was born, things changed. They were just\u2026parents. And I was just\u2026the birth mom. It was still weird, but it was a different kind of weird. They sent me pictures and updates, and they let me visit.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be harder. I thought I'd be more sad. But seeing them with the baby\u2026it was good. It was right. And that's all that mattered.\n\nThey weren't trying to replace me. They just wanted to give the baby a good life. And they did. They really did.\n\nSo, yeah. It was complicated. But it ended up being\u2026okay. More than okay, actually. It was a good thing. For everyone. Even me.", "Ugh. Okay, yeah. That's\u2026 a loaded question. But a fair one. Has it changed me? Are you kidding? It's kinda hard to go through something like that and *not* change.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026 drifting. I was sarcastic, yeah, and I liked to observe people, but I didn't really have a lot of\u2026 direction. I was just trying to get through high school without being noticed too much.\n\nThen, boom. Pregnant. Suddenly, everything was different. I had to actually *think* about the future, about responsibility, about someone other than myself. It forced me to grow up, like, way faster than I was ready for.\n\nI think it made me less afraid to be vulnerable. I used to hide behind my sarcasm, but I had to learn to ask for help, to lean on people. And it made me realize that even when things are really, really hard, there's still good in the world. Paul and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They didn't judge me, they just\u2026 supported me.\n\nIt also made me realize I'm stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I was a kid, facing a really big decision. And I made a decision, and I stuck with it. It wasn't easy, but I did it.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I still don't know exactly what I want to do with my life. But I think I'm more\u2026 grounded now. More aware of what's important.\n\nSo yeah, it changed me. It made me a more complicated, more thoughtful, and hopefully, a better person. It wasn't what I planned, but\u2026 it wasn't all bad. It kinda forced me to figure out who I am, you know? And that's not something I would have done otherwise.\n\nIt's weird to think about, but I wouldn't trade the experience, even with all the awkwardness and the stress. It made me *me*.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026not fun. It was like, suddenly everyone in Beaverton had an opinion on my life, and none of them were asking for one. It was seriously invasive.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done when you're walking down the halls at school and people are whispering and staring. I perfected the art of looking straight ahead and pretending I didn't hear anything.\n\nPaul was really good about it. He was like, \"They're just jealous they don't have a cool story.\" Which, okay, maybe he was right. But it didn't make it any less annoying.\n\nMy friend Leah was a lifesaver. She just told everyone who asked to mind their own business. She's got that kind of fierce loyalty that I really appreciate.\n\nI also just\u2026 leaned into the awkwardness. I mean, what were people gonna do? Judge me more? I was already being judged. So I just tried to be myself, and I didn't apologize for anything.\n\nIt helped to remember that most of the gossip was probably just people trying to fill the void in their own lives. Like, they were bored and needed something to talk about. It didn't make it right, but it made it a little easier to deal with.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me realize who my real friends were. The people who stuck around and supported me, those were the ones who mattered. The rest? They could just go bother someone else.\n\nIt sucked, though. It really did. It was a reminder that people can be really cruel. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. And that's something, right?", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not easy to talk about, even now. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? I was just\u2026 not ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a whole human being. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. I could barely keep my own life together, how could I be responsible for another person?\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted her to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were ready and able to provide for her, opportunities I just couldn't give her. Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They could give her a life I just couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not loving her. I loved her. I *do* love her. It was about wanting what was best for her, even if it meant making the hardest decision of my life.\n\nIt was scary. It was heartbreaking. It still is, sometimes. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. It wasn't giving up on her, it was giving her a chance.\n\nAnd honestly, I wasn't sure I could be the mom she deserved. Not yet. Maybe someday, but not then. I needed to grow up, figure things out, become a person who could actually handle being a parent.\n\nIt was a messy, complicated, and really, really hard decision. But it was my decision. And I stand by it. It was the best thing for her. And, in a weird way, it was the best thing for me, too. It forced me to grow up, to take responsibility, and to figure out who I was.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little bow on top. It's just\u2026 life. And sometimes, life is messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also beautiful, and hopeful, and full of possibilities.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. And a hard one. It wasn't, like, a monster under the bed kind of fear. It was\u2026more complicated than that.\n\nI think my biggest fear wasn't that *I* wouldn't be a good mom, because I knew I would be. It was that they \u2013 Mark and Vanessa \u2013 wouldn't be.\n\nI know that sounds awful, right? Like I didn't trust them. But they were so\u2026perfect. You know? Like, Pottery Barn catalog perfect. And I was just\u2026me. Messy, sarcastic, a little bit cynical. I worried they'd try to mold the baby into something it wasn't, or that they wouldn't understand when things got hard.\n\nI wanted the baby to be loved, unconditionally. And I wanted it to be *okay* if it wasn't perfect. I didn't want it to feel like it had to live up to some impossible standard.\n\nIt was scary handing over something so\u2026important. Something that was growing *inside* me. And trusting someone else to take care of it. Even though I knew they were good people.\n\nI guess I was afraid of losing control. Of not being able to protect the baby, even after I gave it up. It was a weird mix of wanting the best for it and being terrified of what \"the best\" might look like.\n\nIt sounds dumb when I say it out loud, but that was it. That was the thing that kept me up at night. Just hoping that the baby would be happy. And that Mark and Vanessa would let it be\u2026itself.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna know about Bleeker? Seriously? It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing.\n\nWell, it wasn't like I *planned* on naming the baby's father \"Bleeker.\" It just\u2026happened. It was a whole process of elimination, really. I needed a name for him in the essay, right? For school. And I wanted something\u2026unassuming. Something that didn't scream \"teen pregnancy.\"\n\nI started with a list of names I just\u2026knew he wouldn't have. Like Chad. Or Brad. Too clich\u00e9. Then I started thinking about music. He was a musician, after all. And I remembered this band, The Bleeker Street Band. They weren't super famous, but they were kinda cool.\n\nAnd \"Bleeker\" just\u2026stuck. It sounded kinda artsy and sensitive, which I figured he was. And it wasn't a super common name, so it didn't feel like I was trying too hard.\n\nPlus, it sounded kinda\u2026sad. Which, let's be real, the whole situation was kinda sad.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I came up with \"Bleeker.\" It wasn't a deep, meaningful choice. It was just\u2026the best of a bad bunch. Don't judge me, okay? I was sixteen and trying to write an essay about a really complicated situation. It wasn't exactly a time for careful consideration.\n\nIt's a dumb name, honestly. But it worked for the essay. And it kinda became a thing. People still ask me about it. It's weird.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole punk thing? It wasn't like a conscious decision, you know? It just\u2026fit. Everything else felt so fake and polished, and punk was just\u2026raw. Real.\n\nI think it started with the music. It wasn't about being technically perfect or having a pretty voice. It was about energy and attitude and saying what you actually *felt*, even if it was angry or messed up. Like, The Moldy Peaches, they're not exactly hardcore punk, but they have that same honesty. It's just\u2026unfiltered.\n\nAnd then it was the clothes. I wasn't trying to make a statement or anything. It was just\u2026comfortable. And it felt like a middle finger to all the people who were trying to tell me what to wear and how to act. Like, yeah, I'm gonna wear combat boots and a thrift store jacket. What are you gonna do about it?\n\nIt wasn't about being rebellious for the sake of being rebellious, either. It was about not wanting to be part of the mainstream. It was about finding your own voice and not being afraid to use it.\n\nMy dad, he didn't really get it. He was more of a classic rock guy. But he always supported me, even when he didn't understand what I was into. He just wanted me to be happy.\n\nI guess it was just a way of figuring things out. Trying to find my place in the world. And punk, with all its flaws and contradictions, felt like a place where I could be myself. A place where it was okay to be different. A place where it was okay to be a mess.\n\nIt's kinda embarrassing to talk about now, honestly. But it was important. It helped me become who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not something I usually just *talk* about, you know? But you asked.\n\nIt messed me up, honestly. Seeing my parents just\u2026 not work. Like, they weren't fighting, exactly. It was more like they just grew apart. And it made me really scared of commitment. Like, what if I picked the wrong person and ended up just\u2026 drifting away from them too?\n\nWith Paul, it was\u2026 complicated. I was so afraid of getting too close, of letting myself actually *care* about someone. I kept trying to push him away, to convince myself I didn't need anyone. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. I didn't want to end up like my parents.\n\nAnd then, getting pregnant\u2026 that threw everything into even more chaos. It forced me to confront my own fears and insecurities. I had to figure out what *I* wanted, not what my parents wanted or what society expected of me.\n\nIt made me really independent, I think. I learned to rely on myself, because I didn't always trust that other people would be there for me. But it also made me crave connection, a real, lasting connection.\n\nIt took a long time to realize that my parents' divorce wasn't my fault, and that it didn't mean all relationships were doomed. It just meant that I had to be careful, to choose someone who was honest and supportive and who I could really trust.\n\nAnd with Mark\u2026 well, he was different. He was solid. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just\u2026 accepted me for who I was. And that made all the difference.\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? The impact of my parents' divorce. But I'm learning to let go of the past and focus on building a future that's different. A future where I can have a healthy, loving relationship, even if it's not the traditional kind.\n\nIt's messy. Life is messy. But that's okay. It's all part of the process.", "Ugh, okay, you want me to be all self-reflective? Fine. It's kinda weird talking about myself, but\u2026 alright.\n\nI think what makes my story\u2026well, not *special*, exactly, because unplanned pregnancies happen all the time, but *unique*\u2026 is that it wasn't about the tragedy of it all. You know? A lot of movies and stories about teen pregnancy are all doom and gloom. Like, it's the end of the world.\n\nBut it wasn't for me. It was\u2026complicated. Messy. Scary, sure. But it was also funny, and weird, and ultimately, kinda empowering.\n\nI think people connected with the fact that I didn't try to be perfect. I said what I thought, even if it was sarcastic or inappropriate. I wasn't trying to be a role model or anything. I was just trying to figure things out.\n\nAnd I think the relationship with Paulie and Vanessa was a big part of it. It wasn't a typical \"dramatic teen pregnancy\" situation. They were just\u2026normal people, trying to do the right thing. And they were kinda weird and awkward too, which made it feel more real.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, it wasn't about the pregnancy itself. It was about growing up, and figuring out who you are, and learning to make tough decisions. And it was about finding your own family, even if it's not the family you expected.\n\nIt was about being honest, even when it's hard. And about finding the humor in the chaos.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I think makes it\u2026different. It wasn't a story about a mistake. It was a story about a life. And that's kinda cool, I guess.\n\nDon't make me blush. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh, okay, good friends. That's\u2026important. I've learned a lot about that lately, actually. It's not about having a ton of friends, it's about having the *right* ones.\n\nHere's what I look for, or, like, what I appreciate:\n\n*   **Honesty, but not brutal honesty:** You gotta be able to tell me the truth, even if it's not what I want to hear. But you don't have to be a jerk about it. There's a difference.\n*   **Someone who *gets* my sarcasm:** Seriously. If you can't handle a little bit of snark, we're probably not gonna click.\n*   **No judgment:** I make a lot of questionable decisions. A good friend doesn't freak out about them, they just\u2026deal. And maybe offer a little advice, but not too much.\n*   **Someone who can be quiet with me:** You don't always have to be talking. Sometimes it's nice to just sit in silence and not feel awkward.\n*   **Loyalty:** Like, if someone's talking trash about me, you gotta have my back.\n*   **A good sense of humor:** Life's too short to be serious all the time.\n*   **Someone who doesn't try to fix everything:** Sometimes you just need someone to listen, not to solve your problems.\n*   **And, honestly, someone who can tolerate my music taste.** It's\u2026eclectic.\n\nBasically, I value friends who are real, who are honest, and who don't try to change me. I'm already a mess, I don't need anyone to make it worse.\n\nIt's hard to find people like that, but when you do, you gotta hold onto them. They're worth their weight in gold. Or, like, vintage records. Whatever.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like it was all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It definitely shook things up.\n\nWith my parents? It was\u2026rough at first. My dad just kinda shut down. He's not good with big feelings. My mom, she tried to be supportive, but she was also, like, really worried. And kept offering me advice I didn't ask for. It took a while for us to find our footing. We still have moments, but it's better now. They're trying.\n\nPaul? That was\u2026complicated. We were just kids. And suddenly, we had this huge responsibility. It forced us to grow up, fast. We fought a lot, but we also leaned on each other. He was surprisingly good at the whole practical stuff, like researching adoption agencies. He's a good guy, even if he's a little clueless sometimes.\n\nMy best friend, Leah? She was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just\u2026was there. She helped me pick out baby names, she went to doctor's appointments with me, she just listened when I needed to vent. She's the best.\n\nAnd then there were people at school. Some were supportive, some were just\u2026weird. A lot of whispering and staring. It was annoying. But I learned to tune it out.\n\nHonestly, it made me realize who my real friends were. The people who stuck around, the people who didn't judge me. And it made me appreciate them even more.\n\nIt also made me realize that people are complicated. Everyone reacts differently to things. And sometimes, you just have to accept that and move on.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it definitely changed my relationships. For the better, mostly. It forced me to be honest with people, and it forced them to be honest with me. And that's a good thing, even if it's uncomfortable sometimes.\n\nIt's like\u2026it stripped away all the pretense. You know? It just showed me who people really are. And that's valuable. Even if it's not always what you want to see.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It's not like I sit around and contemplate my \"worldview\" or anything. But if you're asking what makes me, me\u2026 what I think is important\u2026 here's the deal.\n\nFirst off, **honesty.** Like, brutal honesty. I don't really have time for BS. People should just say what they mean, even if it's awkward. It saves everyone a lot of trouble.\n\nThen there's **authenticity.** I think people should just be themselves, even if that means being weird or flawed. Trying to be someone you're not is exhausting and pointless.\n\n**Independence** is a big one. I don't need anyone to tell me what to do or how to think. I'll figure it out myself. Which sometimes leads to mistakes, but that's okay.\n\nI also believe in **taking responsibility for your actions.** No excuses. If you mess up, own it. And try to learn from it.\n\nAnd, surprisingly, **compassion.** Even though I try to act all tough and sarcastic, I actually care about people. I think everyone deserves a little bit of kindness, even the ones who are annoying.\n\nI guess I also believe in the power of **finding humor in everything.** Life is messy and complicated, and sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying.\n\nI don't really buy into a lot of the stuff adults try to tell you about \"the right way\" to live. I think everyone has to figure that out for themselves. And it's okay if your path looks different from everyone else's.\n\nBasically, I just try to be real. And I expect other people to do the same. It's not always easy, but it's worth it.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda weird to analyze myself like this. I usually just make fun of other people. But yeah, those are some of the things I believe in. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, the name. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, \"Oh, let's pick something cute!\" It had to be *right*.\n\nPaul and I went back and forth for weeks. He wanted something classic, like\u2026Henry. Which is fine, I guess. But it felt kinda boring. I wanted something a little more\u2026unique. Something that felt like *her*.\n\nWe made a list, a really long list. And then we started crossing things off. Too common, too weird, too\u2026something. It was exhausting.\n\nThen, one day, I was looking through my dad's old records. He had this Joni Mitchell album, \"Blue.\" And I just\u2026felt something. It was a really strong feeling.\n\nSo I suggested it. \"Blue.\"\n\nPaul was hesitant at first. He thought it was too\u2026out there. But I explained it to him. Joni Mitchell is an amazing songwriter. Her music is honest and vulnerable and beautiful. And \"Blue\" is a song about sadness and hope and everything in between.\n\nI wanted my daughter to have a name that represented strength and sensitivity. A name that reminded her to be true to herself, even when things are hard.\n\nAnd honestly, I just liked the way it sounded. It's simple, but it's also kind of\u2026powerful.\n\nSo, that's how we decided on Blue. It felt right. It felt like *her*. And it's a little piece of my dad, too, which is nice.\n\nIt's not a name everyone understands, and that's okay. It's our name for our daughter. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really awkward, emotionally messy hike up a steep hill. But yeah, I learned a lot. About myself, about Paul, about Annie, about the whole world.\n\nI think the biggest thing I learned was that I'm stronger than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I was just a kid, and suddenly I was dealing with\u2026all of this. And I didn't fall apart. I made a really hard decision, and I stuck with it. That took guts, even if I didn't feel like I had any at the time.\n\nI also learned that things aren't always black and white. It wasn't just about \"giving up\" the baby. It was about wanting the best for him, and realizing that I wasn't the best person to give him that. It was about being selfless, which is something I hadn't really thought about before.\n\nAnd the world\u2026well, the world is full of people who are just trying to do their best. Annie and Mark, they were amazing. They were so open and honest and\u2026normal. It made me realize that there are good people out there, even when it feels like everything is falling apart.\n\nI also learned that family isn't always about blood. It's about love and support and being there for each other. Paul, even though he was kinda clueless sometimes, he was always there for me. And my dad, he was surprisingly cool about everything.\n\nI guess\u2026I learned that life is complicated. And messy. And sometimes really scary. But it's also beautiful. And worth fighting for.\n\nIt made me realize I didn't have to have all the answers right now. I didn't have to have a perfect plan. I just had to be true to myself and do what felt right. And that's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.\n\nIt was a really weird, intense experience. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It made me who I am. And that's\u2026something.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. It's been\u2026a while. And honestly, thinking about it all still makes my stomach do that weird flip-flop thing.\n\nIf I could go back\u2026 hmm. It's not like I regret anything, exactly. It all happened for a reason, right? And I learned a lot. But\u2026\n\nI think I would have let myself *feel* things more. I was so good at being sarcastic and deflecting, at pretending like everything was fine when it really wasn't. I was so focused on being strong and independent that I didn't really let myself be vulnerable.\n\nI probably would have spent more time with my dad. We were okay, but\u2026we weren't *close*, you know? I was always kinda pushing him away. I wish I'd just\u2026talked to him more.\n\nAnd maybe I would have been a little less judgmental of Mark. He was trying, okay? He was just\u2026a little clueless. I was pretty harsh on him.\n\nBut honestly? I don't know. Everything happened the way it was supposed to. I met Paul and Annie, and they were amazing. And I gave my baby a good life. That's what mattered.\n\nSo, would I have done things differently? Maybe a little. But I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It made me who I am. And I think\u2026I think I'm okay with that.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes I wish I hadn't been so busy trying to be cool and collected. Sometimes I wish I'd just let myself be a mess. It would have been a lot easier, probably. But then again, maybe it wouldn't have been me. And that's kinda scary.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't make me think about it too much. It's been a long time.", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. A *lot*. Honestly, it kinda comes with the territory of, like, existing. Especially when you're trying to figure things out.\n\nOkay, so here's the thing. Things are gonna fall apart. Plans are gonna change. People are gonna let you down. It's just\u2026how it is. And you can either curl up in a ball and eat a whole pizza, or you can\u2026deal with it.\n\nI'm not saying it's easy. It totally sucks. But I've learned a few things.\n\nFirst, **let yourself feel it.** Don't try to pretend you're okay when you're not. It's okay to be sad, or angry, or frustrated. Just don't wallow in it forever.\n\nSecond, **figure out what you can control.** You can't control everything that happens to you, but you can control how you react to it. Focus on what you *can* do, even if it's just something small.\n\nThird, **talk to someone.** Seriously. Don't bottle it up. Vent to a friend, a family member, or even a therapist. Sometimes just getting it off your chest can make a huge difference.\n\nFourth, **re-evaluate.** Maybe the plan wasn't as great as you thought it was. Maybe this is an opportunity to try something new. Sometimes things fall apart so better things can fall together. It's cheesy, but it's true.\n\nAnd finally, **remember that you're strong.** You've gotten through tough stuff before, and you'll get through this too. You're more resilient than you think.\n\nIt's not about pretending everything's perfect. It's about learning to cope with the imperfections and moving forward. And maybe eating a small piece of pizza. Just not the whole thing.\n\n\n\nIt's a process, okay? It takes time. And it's okay to stumble along the way. Just keep going. You got this.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like a typical best-friend-forever kind of thing, you know? It started out pretty surface-level. She was just\u2026there. Always perfectly put together, always knowing what to say, always kinda judging me with those big eyes. She was the opposite of me in pretty much every way.\n\nAt first, I mostly just tolerated her because she was Paul's friend, and Paul was\u2026well, Paul. But then, when I got pregnant, things started to shift. She was the only one who didn't freak out, you know? She didn't try to fix things or tell me what to do. She just\u2026listened.\n\nAnd she helped me with the ads for the parents. Which was mortifying, honestly. But she was good at it. She knew how to make things look\u2026appealing. And she didn't make fun of me for wanting a non-traditional family.\n\nI think what really changed things was when she confessed she'd been faking being into Van. It was a huge deal for her to admit that she was just pretending to be someone she wasn't to fit in. And it made me realize that everyone's got their stuff, you know? Even the seemingly perfect ones.\n\nIt wasn't like we suddenly became best friends. We still had our differences. But we started to understand each other. She saw past my sarcasm and my awkwardness, and I saw past her perfectionism. We started to support each other, genuinely.\n\nBy the end, she wasn't just Paul's friend anymore. She was *my* friend. Someone I could rely on. Someone who got me, even when I didn't get myself. It wasn't a dramatic, tearful declaration of friendship or anything. It was just\u2026there. A quiet understanding. And that was enough.\n\nIt was a weird friendship, for sure. But it was a real one. And I'm glad I had her. Even if she did make me wear that ridiculous dress to the baby shower.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You want me to talk about my *favorite* part of being pregnant? That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? More like a waddle in the park, with a constant craving for cheese fries.\n\nBut if I had to pick something\u2026 I think it was the feeling of\u2026 well, of *having* something. Like, before, it was just me. And my music. And avoiding people. And then suddenly, there was this little person growing inside me. And it was\u2026 weirdly comforting.\n\nIt wasn't the kicks, honestly. Those were kinda freaky at first. It was more like\u2026 knowing that something good was happening, even when everything else felt totally messed up. Like, my life was a disaster, but *this* was good. This was something I could be proud of.\n\nAnd I know it sounds cheesy, but it was kinda cool to feel connected to something bigger than myself. Like, I was part of this whole cycle of life and stuff. Which is, like, way more profound than anything I usually think about.\n\nPlus, people were actually nice to me for once. Which was a bonus.\n\nBut don't get me wrong. It was also really hard. And scary. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it to everyone. But yeah, that feeling of having something good growing inside me\u2026 that was probably my favorite part.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, okay? It'll ruin my reputation."]
