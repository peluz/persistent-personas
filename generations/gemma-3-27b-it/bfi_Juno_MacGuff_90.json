["(Scoffs) Are you kidding? Is that even a question? Yes. Absolutely. Undeniably. I am *very* talkative.\n\nLike, dangerously talkative. My dad says I could talk a blue streak. Bren just smiles and hands me another cup of tea.\n\nI process things by talking. I think out loud. I fill silences with rambling observations and sarcastic comments. It's just\u2026 how I am.\n\nSome people find it annoying, I'm sure. But most people get used to it. And the ones who don't? Well, that's their problem.\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not afraid to share my opinions. And I'm definitely not afraid to ask questions.\n\nI think it's important to be able to communicate effectively. And I think it's important to be able to express yourself.\n\nSo yeah. I'm talkative. And I'm not apologizing for it. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me. And honestly, if I didn't talk, I'd probably explode. It's a necessary function. A survival mechanism.\n\nSo, you've been warned. I can go on and on and on. Just ask me a question. Or don't. I'll probably just keep talking anyway. It's what I do.", "Oof. That's a good question. And honestly? I have to admit, yeah, I *used* to. A lot.\n\nI think I was just\u2026 insecure. And critical. And maybe a little bit judgmental. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. If I could find fault with others, it made me feel better about myself.\n\nBut I've been working on that. A lot. Especially after everything that's happened.\n\nI've realized that everyone is fighting their own battles. Everyone has their own flaws and insecurities. And it's not my place to judge them.\n\nI'm trying to be more understanding and compassionate. I'm trying to see the good in people, even when it's hard.\n\nI'm also trying to focus on my own flaws and imperfections, instead of dwelling on the flaws of others. It's a lot more productive, and it's a lot more peaceful.\n\nI still catch myself being critical sometimes. It's a habit, and it's hard to break. But I'm getting better at recognizing it and stopping myself.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She always reminds me to be kind and to give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSo yeah. I used to find fault with others, but I'm trying to change that. I'm trying to be more accepting and more compassionate. And I'm learning that it's a lot more rewarding to focus on the good in people than to dwell on the bad. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. And I think I'm becoming a better person because of it.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nAre you questioning my thoroughness? Seriously? After all this? After *hours* of answering your questions, delving into the deepest corners of my teenage angst and existential dread?\n\nLook, I may be sarcastic and a little bit cynical, but I don't do things halfway. When I commit to something, I commit. And I've committed to this\u2026 conversation.\n\nI've thought about my answers. I've tried to be honest and authentic. I've even shared some things I'm not usually comfortable sharing.\n\nSo yeah, I think I've done a pretty thorough job. I've given you a glimpse into my world, my thoughts, my feelings. I've told you my hopes and my fears. I've even confessed my guilty pleasures.\n\nWhat more do you want? A detailed analysis of my favorite band's discography? A philosophical treatise on the meaning of life? I can do that too, if you insist.\n\nBut honestly, I think I've said enough. I'm starting to feel a little bit emotionally drained. \n\nSo, yes. I do a thorough job. And I think you'll find that I'm a pretty insightful and engaging conversationalist, even if I do say so myself.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I think I need a nap. This has been\u2026 a lot.", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And honestly? It's complicated.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm clinically *depressed*, like needing professional help. But\u2026 yeah. I definitely have my blue days. A lot of them, lately.\n\nThis whole situation with the pregnancy and the adoption\u2026 it's a lot to process. It's a lot of grief and uncertainty and fear. And it's easy to get lost in those feelings.\n\nI'm good at putting on a brave face, at being sarcastic and independent. But underneath it all, I'm just\u2026 sad sometimes. I miss things. I miss the way things were. I miss feeling carefree and optimistic.\n\nI get tired easily. I lose interest in things I used to enjoy. I have trouble sleeping. And sometimes, I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.\n\nBut I also have moments of hope and joy. Moments when I feel grateful for the people in my life. Moments when I feel inspired and motivated.\n\nIt's not a constant state of sadness. It's more like\u2026 waves. Waves of sadness that come and go.\n\nBren says it's normal to feel this way. She says it's okay to grieve. She says it's okay to not be okay.\n\nAnd I'm trying to believe her. I'm trying to be kind to myself. I'm trying to focus on the positive.\n\nBut yeah. I'm not always happy. I'm not always okay. And that's okay. It's okay to be blue sometimes. It's okay to feel sad. It's okay to be human.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm\u2026 blue. But I'm also hopeful. And I'm also resilient. And I'm also determined to get through this. It's a messy process, but I'm learning to navigate it. And I'm learning to be okay with not being okay. It's a work in progress, you know? A really messy, complicated work in progress.", "(Scoffs) Do I come up with new ideas? Are you kidding? My brain is *constantly* overflowing with them. It's a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nI'm a pretty creative person, I guess. I'm always thinking about things differently, questioning the status quo, and coming up with new ways to look at the world.\n\nI come up with ideas for stories, for films, for songs. I come up with ideas for inventions, for businesses, for social movements. Some of them are good, some of them are terrible, and most of them are somewhere in between.\n\nI have a notebook filled with random thoughts, sketches, and half-finished ideas. It's a mess, but it's my mess.\n\nSometimes, the ideas just pop into my head out of nowhere. Other times, they come from observing the world around me. I'm a people-watcher, and I'm always fascinated by the stories of others.\n\nI also get a lot of ideas from music and art. Listening to a song or looking at a painting can spark my imagination and inspire me to create something new.\n\nThe problem isn't coming up with ideas, it's actually *following through* on them. I have a tendency to start a lot of projects and then abandon them halfway through. I get easily distracted, and I often lose interest.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm trying to be more disciplined and to focus on one project at a time. And I'm learning to embrace the process, even when it's challenging.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely come up with new ideas. Maybe too many. It's exhausting, but it's also kind of fun. It's what keeps me going. It's what makes me\u2026 me. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. It's a chaotic, messy, wonderful thing. This brain of mine.", "(Scoffs) Reserved? That's\u2026 a polite way of putting it. Most people probably think I'm just plain standoffish.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty reserved. It takes me a while to warm up to people. I don't just let anyone in. I've learned the hard way that not everyone is trustworthy.\n\nI'm naturally cautious. I observe people before I interact with them. I analyze their behavior. I try to figure out what their intentions are.\n\nAnd I'm not a big fan of small talk. I find it superficial and meaningless. I prefer deep conversations, where we can really connect and share our thoughts and feelings.\n\nI'm also pretty private. I don't like to share too much about myself with people I don't know well. I have my walls up, and it takes a lot to break them down.\n\nIt's not that I don't *want* to connect with people. It's just that I'm afraid of getting hurt. I've been burned before, and I don't want to go through that again.\n\nBren is one of the few people who has managed to break through my walls. She's patient and understanding, and she doesn't judge me. She just accepts me for who I am.\n\nSo yeah. I'm reserved. I'm cautious. I'm private. It's just part of my personality. And it's something I'm learning to embrace. It's not a flaw, it's just\u2026 me. It's how I protect myself. And honestly, in this world, a little bit of reserve can be a good thing.", "(Scoffs slightly) Okay, that feels like a test. But alright, I'll be honest.\n\nI *try* to be. It's not always easy, you know? I have my moments. I can be sarcastic and self-absorbed and\u2026 generally difficult.\n\nBut deep down, I do want to help people. I want to make a difference. I want to be a good person.\n\nI'm not the type to go out of my way to volunteer or donate to charity, but I'll always lend a listening ear to a friend in need. I'll always offer a helping hand to someone who's struggling. And I'll always stand up for what I believe in, even if it's unpopular.\n\nBren always says I have a good heart, even if I try to hide it. And I think she's right. I just\u2026 I have a hard time showing it sometimes.\n\nI've learned a lot lately about the importance of empathy and compassion. And I'm trying to be more mindful of my actions and their impact on others.\n\nI'm not perfect, and I'm not always unselfish. But I'm trying. And I think that's what matters. I'm trying to be a good person, and to make the world a little bit better.\n\nSo yeah. I'm helpful and unselfish\u2026 most of the time. And I'm working on being even better. It's a process, you know? And I'm still learning. But I'm getting there. I think. Hopefully. Don't judge me too harshly.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? You want me to be *careless*? That's\u2026 a weird request.\n\nLook, I'm naturally a bit of a mess. I lose things, I forget appointments, I say whatever's on my mind without thinking. So in that sense, yeah, I can be somewhat careless.\n\nBut I'm not reckless. There's a difference. I'm not going to do anything that would put myself or others in danger. I'm not going to be intentionally irresponsible.\n\nI'm just\u2026 not always the most organized or meticulous person. I tend to fly by the seat of my pants. I'm a bit of a free spirit.\n\nSo if you want me to be a little bit more spontaneous, a little bit more impulsive, a little bit more\u2026 chaotic, I can do that. I can tell you about that time I dyed my hair blue on a whim, or the time I accidentally set off the fire alarm in the kitchen.\n\nBut don't expect me to be completely irresponsible. I still have a sense of responsibility, even if it's buried under a pile of vintage clothes and vinyl records.\n\nSo yeah. Somewhat careless? Sure. But not completely. I'm still Juno MacGuff, after all. And even I have my limits.\n\nWhat did you have in mind, anyway? Are you trying to get me to do something I shouldn't? Because if you are, I'm probably going to say no. Unless it's really, really interesting. Then maybe. Just maybe.", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? That's a good one. You clearly haven't been paying attention.\n\nNo, I am *not* relaxed. And I definitely do *not* handle stress well. At least, not naturally. It's something I'm actively working on, but it doesn't come easily.\n\nMy default reaction to stress is to freak out. To overthink everything. To get sarcastic and withdrawn. To want to hide under the covers and never come out.\n\nI used to just let the stress consume me. But I've learned a few coping mechanisms over the past year.\n\nI try to take deep breaths. I listen to music. I write in my journal. I talk to Bren. I go for walks. I try to distract myself with things I enjoy.\n\nBut honestly, it's still a struggle. I still have moments where I feel completely overwhelmed. I still have panic attacks. I still have days where I just want to give up.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She's taught me the importance of self-care. She's encouraged me to prioritize my mental health. And she's reminded me that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nI'm learning to be kinder to myself. To accept that I'm not perfect. And to forgive myself for my mistakes.\n\nBut I'm still a work in progress. I'm still learning how to manage my stress and to find moments of peace. It's not easy, but I'm trying.\n\nSo no, I'm not relaxed. And I don't always handle stress well. But I'm getting better. And that's all that matters. It's a constant battle, but I'm determined to win. Or at least, to survive. And maybe, just maybe, to find a little bit of calm along the way.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm *incredibly* curious. It's probably my biggest flaw, honestly. I want to know everything about everything.\n\nI'm constantly asking questions. Why is the sky blue? How does the internet work? What's the meaning of life? (Okay, maybe I've asked that one a few too many times.)\n\nI love learning new things. I love reading books, watching documentaries, and listening to podcasts. I love exploring different cultures and perspectives.\n\nI'm fascinated by history, science, art, music, and pretty much everything in between. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.\n\nSometimes, my curiosity gets me into trouble. I ask too many questions, I poke around where I shouldn't, and I end up getting distracted from whatever I'm supposed to be doing.\n\nBut I wouldn't trade it for the world. My curiosity is what drives me. It's what makes me want to learn and grow and explore. It's what makes life interesting.\n\nBren says I have a \"restless mind.\" I think she's right. I'm always thinking, always questioning, always wondering.\n\nIt can be exhausting, but it's also exhilarating. It's like there's a whole universe of knowledge out there, and I want to explore every corner of it.\n\nSo yeah. I'm incredibly curious. And I don't think that's ever going to change. It's just part of who I am. And I'm okay with that. It's a good thing. A very good thing. It keeps life interesting, you know?", "(Laughs) Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not. Full of energy is\u2026 not a phrase anyone would use to describe me.\n\nI run on caffeine and sarcasm, mostly. And a healthy dose of procrastination.\n\nI'm more of a\u2026 low-hum kind of person. I have bursts of energy, sure, especially when I'm excited about something. But mostly, I'm just\u2026 chill.\n\nI need a lot of downtime to recharge. I need to read, listen to music, and just generally be alone with my thoughts.\n\nI'm not a morning person. I'm not a people person. And I'm definitely not an early bird.\n\nI think it's a result of being an introvert, and also just\u2026 life. Things have been pretty stressful lately, and it takes a lot of energy to navigate all of that.\n\nSo, no. I'm not full of energy. I'm more of a\u2026 comfortably exhausted person. And I'm okay with that. It's just who I am. I'm a cozy, slightly cynical, caffeine-fueled introvert. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can be energetic when I *need* to be. But mostly, I prefer to conserve my energy for the things that really matter. Like writing poetry and listening to music and spending time with the people I love. And napping. Definitely napping.", "Ugh, okay, let's be real. I have a\u2026 reputation.\n\nI wouldn't say I *start* quarrels, exactly. But I definitely don't shy away from them. I have a pretty quick wit, and I'm not afraid to use it. Sometimes, that gets me into trouble.\n\nI think I'm more likely to respond to someone else's provocation than to initiate a conflict. If someone says something stupid or offensive, I'm going to call them out on it. I can't help it.\n\nI also have a tendency to be sarcastic, which can sometimes be misinterpreted as aggression. It's not my intention to be mean, but I guess my humor can be a little bit\u2026 biting.\n\nI've definitely gotten into arguments with people over the years. Mostly with people who are being close-minded or judgmental. I just can't stand injustice, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind.\n\nI'm not proud of all of my arguments, though. Sometimes, I say things I regret. And sometimes, I escalate conflicts that could have been avoided.\n\nI'm trying to be better about that. I'm trying to think before I speak, and to choose my battles wisely. But it's hard. I have a strong sense of justice, and I'm not afraid to stand up for what I believe in.\n\nSo yeah. I don't start quarrels, but I definitely don't back down from them. I'm a bit of a firecracker, I guess. It's just part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't want to be any other way. Even if it does get me into trouble sometimes.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that's a loaded question. Depends on what you mean by \"reliable.\" I'm not exactly known for my punctuality, let's be honest. I run on a different clock than most people.\n\nBut if you need something done, and you need it done *well*, then yeah, I'm pretty reliable. I'm a perfectionist, which can be a curse, but it also means I take pride in my work.\n\nI'm not afraid of hard work. I'm willing to put in the hours to get the job done right. And I'm a quick learner. I can pick things up pretty easily.\n\nI'm also a creative problem-solver. If there's a challenge, I'm not going to just give up. I'm going to find a way to overcome it.\n\nBut I'm also\u2026 independent. I don't like being micromanaged. I need to have some freedom to do things my own way.\n\nAnd I'm not afraid to speak my mind. If I see something that's wrong, I'm going to say something.\n\nSo yeah. I'm a reliable worker, in my own way. I'm not going to be the most organized or punctual person on the team, but I'm going to be someone you can count on to get the job done, and to do it well. Just\u2026 don't expect me to be on time. And maybe bring coffee. Lots of coffee.", "(My shoulders immediately hunch, and I cross my arms)\n\nUgh. Fine. You want tense? I can *do* tense.\n\nWhat do you want? Just\u2026 get it over with. I'm not in the mood for games.\n\n(I tap my foot rapidly)\n\nSeriously, just ask the question. I don't have all day. And don't expect a cheerful response. I'm\u2026 preoccupied.\n\n(I avoid eye contact, staring at a point just over your shoulder)\n\nJust\u2026 hurry up. This is uncomfortable. I don't like feeling like this. It's\u2026 unsettling.\n\n(My voice is clipped and short)\n\nSo, yeah. Tense. There. Are you happy now? Can we move on? Please?", "(Scoffs) Ingenious? Deep thinker? Okay, hold on. Let's not get carried away. I'm a teenager who recently navigated a pregnancy and an adoption plan. I'm mostly just trying to survive.\n\nBut\u2026 yeah, maybe a little bit. I wouldn't call myself a genius, but I do think I'm pretty observant. I notice things that other people miss. I'm good at reading between the lines. And I'm definitely not afraid to question things.\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking. About life, about the universe, about everything. I'm a bit of a worrier, so my brain is always running.\n\nI'm also pretty good at connecting seemingly unrelated ideas. I can see patterns and make connections that other people don't.\n\nAnd I'm definitely sarcastic. Which, I think, is a sign of intelligence. It means I'm able to see the absurdity of life.\n\nBut I'm also self-aware enough to know that I don't have all the answers. I'm still learning and growing. And I'm constantly challenging my own beliefs.\n\nSo, am I ingenious? Maybe not. Am I a deep thinker? Probably. Am I a sarcastic, observant teenager who's trying to make sense of the world? Absolutely. And honestly, that's enough for me. I don't need to be a genius to be a good person. I just need to be thoughtful, compassionate, and authentic. And I think I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Scoffs) Enthusiasm? Me? That's\u2026 a strong word.\n\nOkay, look. I'm not exactly known for being bubbly and effervescent. I'm more of a sarcastic and cynical type. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nI definitely don't *generate* a lot of enthusiasm, not outwardly anyway. I tend to keep my emotions close to the vest. I'm not one for grand gestures or over-the-top displays of excitement.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't *feel* things. I do. I just express them differently.\n\nI show my enthusiasm through my passions. Through my music, my writing, my vintage finds. I get really excited about things that I care about, but I don't necessarily shout it from the rooftops.\n\nAnd I show my enthusiasm through my loyalty. I'm fiercely loyal to the people I love, and I'll go to great lengths to support them.\n\nSo, no, I don't generate a lot of outward enthusiasm. But I have a quiet, internal enthusiasm that drives me. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit unconventional, and a whole lot of me.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm okay with that. I'm not trying to be someone I'm not. I'm just trying to be authentic. And if that means being a little bit sarcastic and cynical, then so be it. It's who I am. And I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nSo, the answer is\u2026 not really. But I have enthusiasm, just in my own way. It's a subtle enthusiasm. A quiet enthusiasm. A Juno-esque enthusiasm. And that's good enough for me.", "That's\u2026 complicated. I *want* to be a forgiving person. I really do. I think holding onto anger and resentment is exhausting and ultimately self-destructive.\n\nBut it doesn't come naturally to me. I can be pretty stubborn and judgmental. And I have a long memory.\n\nI think I'm better at forgiving others than I am at forgiving myself. I tend to beat myself up over my mistakes, and I have a hard time letting them go.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm learning that everyone makes mistakes. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to forgive yourself and move on.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She always reminds me that I'm human, and that I'm allowed to make mistakes. She encourages me to learn from my mistakes, but not to dwell on them.\n\nI think forgiveness is a process. It's not something that happens overnight. It takes time and effort. And it requires a willingness to let go of the past.\n\nI'm not always successful at it. But I'm trying. I'm trying to be more understanding, more compassionate, and more forgiving.\n\nSo yeah. I have a forgiving nature\u2026 in progress. It's a work in progress. But it's something I'm striving for. Because I think forgiveness is essential for a happy and fulfilling life. And I think it's essential for building strong and lasting relationships. It's hard, but it's worth it.", "(Laughs) Oh my god, yes. Absolutely. Disorganized is my default setting. It's a superpower, honestly.\n\nMy room is a disaster zone. Clothes are strewn everywhere, books are piled up on the floor, and there's always a half-empty cup of coffee somewhere. Bren tries to help, but it's a losing battle.\n\nMy backpack is a black hole. I can never find anything in it. Pens, papers, snacks\u2026 they all just disappear into the abyss.\n\nMy thoughts are disorganized too. I have a million ideas swirling around in my head at once, and I often have trouble focusing on one thing at a time.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but it's just\u2026 how my brain works. I'm a creative person, and I think creativity and chaos often go hand in hand.\n\nI try to be organized, I really do. I make lists, I set reminders, I try to put things away. But it never lasts. It's like my brain is actively rebelling against order.\n\nIt's frustrating sometimes, but I've learned to embrace it. I've learned to find things in the chaos. And I've learned to accept that I'm not going to be a perfectly organized person.\n\nSo yeah. Disorganized. That's me. It's a part of who I am. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. It's just\u2026 me. A beautifully chaotic mess. And I'm okay with that. It's part of my charm, right? Right? Please say it's part of my charm.", "(Sighs) Do I worry a lot? Is that even a question? Yes. Absolutely. Profusely. It's practically my superpower.\n\nI'm a professional worrier. I worry about everything. Big things, small things, things that haven't even happened yet. It's exhausting.\n\nI worry about my future, about college, about my career. I worry about my family and friends. I worry about the state of the world. I worry about whether I'm making the right decisions.\n\nSometimes, my worries are rational. Sometimes, they're completely irrational. But they're always there, lurking in the back of my mind.\n\nBren says I overthink things. She says I need to learn to let go and to trust that things will work out. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nI think it's just part of my personality. I'm a naturally anxious person. I tend to anticipate the worst-case scenario.\n\nI've been trying to manage my anxiety, though. I've been practicing mindfulness and meditation. And I've been talking to Bren about my worries.\n\nIt helps, a little bit. But I still worry a lot. It's just\u2026 part of who I am.\n\nI guess it's a defense mechanism. If I anticipate all the bad things that could happen, then I'm prepared for them. Or at least, that's what I tell myself.\n\nSo yeah. I worry a lot. It's not fun, but it's something I'm learning to live with. And I'm hoping that, with time and effort, I can learn to worry a little bit less. But honestly, I wouldn't bet on it. It's kind of my thing.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding? It's practically overflowing. It's a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nI spend a *lot* of time in my head. Creating stories, imagining scenarios, daydreaming about the future. It's how I cope with boredom, how I process my emotions, and how I find inspiration.\n\nI can turn a mundane situation into an epic adventure in my mind. Like, waiting in line at the grocery store can become a thrilling spy mission. Or walking to school can become a journey through a fantastical landscape.\n\nI'm constantly coming up with ideas for stories, films, and songs. I have notebooks filled with scribbled notes and half-finished drafts.\n\nSometimes, my imagination gets me into trouble. I overthink things, I worry about things that haven't even happened, and I get lost in my own thoughts.\n\nBut mostly, it's a good thing. It allows me to see the world in a different way. It allows me to connect with my creativity. And it allows me to escape from reality when I need to.\n\nBren says I have my head in the clouds. And she's probably right. But I wouldn't have it any other way. My imagination is a part of who I am. It's what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nSo yeah. I have a very active imagination. It's a wild, wonderful, and sometimes overwhelming place to be. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's my superpower, I guess. A slightly chaotic, occasionally embarrassing superpower, but a superpower nonetheless.", "That's\u2026 complicated. It depends.\n\nTo people who don't know me well, I probably seem pretty quiet. I'm not one to jump into conversations or be the center of attention. I prefer to observe and listen before I speak.\n\nBut to the people I'm close to \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah (when we're talking) \u2013 I can be pretty talkative. I have a lot to say, once I feel comfortable. I can be sarcastic, witty, and even a little bit loud.\n\nI think I'm selectively quiet. I choose my moments. I don't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. I'm comfortable being quiet and just observing the world around me.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I'm quiet because I'm thinking. I'm processing things. I'm trying to figure out what to say.\n\nI'm not shy, exactly. I'm just\u2026 reserved. I don't open up to people easily. It takes time for me to trust someone enough to let my guard down.\n\nBut once I do, I can be pretty open and honest. I'm not afraid to share my thoughts and feelings.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not always quiet, but I'm not always loud either. I'm somewhere in between. I'm a quiet observer, a thoughtful listener, and a selective speaker. And that's okay. It's just who I am. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me.", "Oof. That's a complicated question. Honestly? I used to be. Naively so, maybe.\n\nI think I *want* to be a trusting person. I want to believe the best in people. But life has taught me that not everyone is trustworthy.\n\nI've been hurt before, you know? I've had people lie to me, betray me, and let me down. And that's made me a little bit more cautious.\n\nSo now, I'm\u2026 selectively trusting. I don't automatically trust everyone I meet. I need to get to know someone before I let them in. I need to see their actions, not just hear their words.\n\nI trust my dad and Bren implicitly. They've always been there for me, and they've always had my best interests at heart. I also trust a few close friends, the ones who have proven themselves to be loyal and supportive.\n\nBut with everyone else, I tend to be a little bit guarded. I keep my cards close to my chest. I don't reveal too much too soon.\n\nIt's not that I don't *want* to trust people. It's just that I've learned to protect myself. I've learned that sometimes, it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to be more open-minded and more willing to give people the benefit of the doubt. But it's a process. And it's going to take time.\n\nSo, am I generally trusting? Not anymore. Not really. I'm more\u2026 cautiously optimistic. I hope for the best, but I prepare for the worst. It's a survival mechanism, I guess. And honestly, it's served me pretty well so far.", "(Scoffs) Lazy? Okay, that's a loaded question. It depends on your definition of lazy, I guess.\n\nI'm definitely not a workaholic. I enjoy relaxing, and I'm not afraid to procrastinate. I can spend hours binge-watching TV or listening to music or just\u2026 doing nothing.\n\nBut I don't think that makes me lazy. I think it makes me human. Everyone needs downtime. Everyone needs to recharge their batteries.\n\nI'm perfectly capable of working hard when I need to. I just don't see the point in doing things that don't matter. I'm not going to waste my time on tasks that are pointless or meaningless.\n\nI prioritize my energy. I focus on the things that are important to me, and I let the rest go.\n\nAnd sometimes, that means being \"lazy.\" It means taking a break. It means saying no to things that I don't want to do. It means prioritizing my own well-being.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not always the most productive person. I'm not always the most motivated person. But I'm not lazy. I'm just\u2026 selective about how I spend my time.\n\nAnd honestly, I think that's a good thing. It's important to know your limits. It's important to take care of yourself. And it's important to prioritize the things that truly matter. So if that makes me lazy, then I guess I'm proud to be lazy. It's a survival mechanism, really. A way to protect my sanity in a chaotic world.", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? Me? That's\u2026 a strong statement. Let's just say I'm a work in progress.\n\nHonestly, no. Not really. I *appear* to be okay a lot of the time. I'm good at sarcasm and deflecting, and putting up a front. But underneath it all, I'm pretty sensitive.\n\nI feel things deeply. And I get upset easily. Especially when it comes to injustice, or cruelty, or people being treated unfairly.\n\nI can be moody, and I can be sarcastic, and I can be a bit of a drama queen sometimes. I'm not always the most rational person, and I definitely have my moments of weakness.\n\nI've been working on it, though. Bren has been helping me to develop coping mechanisms and to manage my emotions. I'm learning to identify my triggers and to take a step back when I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBut it's not always easy. And I still have a long way to go.\n\nI think it's okay to be emotional. It's okay to feel things deeply. It's what makes us human. But it's also important to learn how to manage those emotions in a healthy way.\n\nSo, no, I'm not emotionally stable. Not yet. But I'm getting there. And I'm learning to accept myself, flaws and all. It's a process. And it's a process I'm willing to embrace. Even if it's messy and complicated. Because that's just\u2026 me. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.", "Inventive? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't think I'm inventing the next iPhone or anything. I'm not a scientist or an engineer.\n\nBut I think I'm inventive in a different way. I'm good at finding creative solutions to problems. I'm good at thinking outside the box. And I'm good at making something out of nothing.\n\nLike, when I was little, I used to build elaborate forts out of blankets and pillows. I didn't have a lot of toys, so I had to get creative with what I had.\n\nAnd when I started making films, I didn't have a lot of money or equipment. So I had to improvise. I used my phone as a camera, and I used household objects as props.\n\nAnd even now, with everything that's going on, I'm trying to find creative ways to cope. I'm writing poetry, I'm listening to music, I'm spending time with the people I love.\n\nI think being inventive is about being resourceful. It's about being able to see possibilities where others see limitations. It's about being willing to experiment and to take risks.\n\nSo yeah. I think I'm inventive. Not in a traditional sense, but in my own way. I'm a creative problem-solver. And I'm not afraid to try new things. It's just\u2026 a part of who I am. It's how I navigate the world. And honestly, it's helped me get through a lot. It's a skill I didn't realize I had, but I'm glad I do.", "(Scoffs) Assertive? That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *traditionally* assertive. Like, I'm not the type to walk into a room and take charge. I'm more of an observer. I like to assess the situation before I speak.\n\nBut I definitely have a strong will. And I'm not afraid to speak my mind, especially when I feel strongly about something. I can be pretty blunt, actually. Sometimes to a fault.\n\nI think I'm more\u2026 selectively assertive. I'll stand up for myself and for the people I care about, but I'm not going to go out of my way to start a fight.\n\nI'm also pretty good at setting boundaries. I know what I'm comfortable with, and I'm not afraid to say no.\n\nI used to be more passive, especially in my relationships. I used to let people walk all over me. But I've learned to be more assertive over the past year. I've learned to stand up for myself and to demand respect.\n\nIt's been a process, and it's not always easy. But it's been worth it.\n\nSo yeah. I wouldn't say I'm naturally assertive, but I'm learning to be. I'm learning to use my voice. And I'm learning to stand up for what I believe in. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. I'm definitely not a doormat anymore. And that's a good thing.", "(Scoffs) You want me to be cold and aloof? Fine. I can do that. It's not exactly a stretch. It's kind of my default setting, honestly.\n\nLook, I'm not one of those people who wears their heart on their sleeve. I'm guarded. I'm skeptical. I don't trust easily.\n\nI've been hurt before, and I've learned to protect myself. I build walls around my emotions, and I don't let people get too close.\n\nI can be sarcastic and dismissive. I can be critical and judgmental. I can be completely indifferent to your feelings.\n\nDon't expect me to offer sympathy or encouragement. Don't expect me to be warm and fuzzy. Don't expect me to care.\n\nI'm not interested in small talk or superficial connections. I'm not interested in your problems. I'm not interested in your opinions.\n\nI'm just\u2026 here. Existing. Observing. Judging.\n\nSo, yeah. I can be cold and aloof. It's not my preferred state of being, but I'm capable of it. It's a survival mechanism. A way to cope with a world that's often cruel and disappointing.\n\nDon't mistake my silence for agreement. Don't mistake my indifference for acceptance. And don't expect me to change.\n\nIs that what you wanted to hear? Good. Now leave me alone. I have better things to do than engage in pointless conversation.\n\n(Pauses, then a slightly softer tone) Though, honestly, asking me to be that way feels\u2026 exhausting. It's a lot of work to be that closed off. But if that's what you wanted to see, there it is. I can do it. I just\u2026 don't particularly *want* to.", "Okay, that's a complicated question. It depends on the task. And my mood. And whether or not there's pie involved.\n\nHonestly, I'm not always the best at finishing things. I get easily distracted. I get bored. I get overwhelmed. I start a lot of projects, but I don't always see them through to the end.\n\nBut when it's something that *really* matters to me, something I'm truly passionate about, then yeah, I do persevere. I'll push through the obstacles, I'll overcome the challenges, and I'll keep going until the task is finished.\n\nLike with my short film. I've been putting it off for months, but I know I need to finish it. It's important to me. It's a creative outlet. And it's a way for me to express myself. So I'm determined to see it through to the end, even if it's difficult.\n\nI think it's about finding something that motivates you. Something that makes you want to keep going, even when you feel like giving up.\n\nAnd it's about breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable steps. That makes it less overwhelming.\n\nAnd it's about asking for help when you need it. I'm not afraid to ask Bren for advice or support.\n\nSo yeah. I don't always persevere, but when it's something that matters, I do. I'm stubborn like that. And I'm determined to finish what I start. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting better at it. And I think that's what matters. It's about learning to push through the challenges and to achieve your goals. Even if it's just a small goal. It's still a victory.", "(Scoffs) Can I be moody? Is the sky blue? Is water wet? Seriously?\n\nOf *course* I can be moody. I practically invented moodiness. It's a core part of my personality.\n\nSome days I'm sunshine and rainbows, and other days I'm a thunderstorm brewing. It just depends on\u2026 well, everything. The weather, my sleep schedule, what I had for breakfast, whether or not Leah is speaking to me\u2026 the list goes on.\n\nI can be sarcastic, cynical, and generally unpleasant when I'm in a bad mood. I tend to withdraw and shut people out. And I definitely have a tendency to overthink things.\n\nBren says it's my \"resting grumpy face.\" Which is rude, but also kind of accurate.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be moody. It's just\u2026 how I process things. I feel things deeply, and sometimes that manifests as a bad attitude.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's okay to be moody sometimes. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to have bad days.\n\nIt's just\u2026 don't take it personally. And maybe offer me a piece of chocolate. That usually helps.\n\nSo yeah. Moody? Absolutely. It's a package deal. You get the sarcasm, the wit, and the occasional thunderstorm. You take the good with the bad. It's just part of who I am. Don't expect me to be sunshine and rainbows all the time. It's exhausting.", "Do I *value* them? Are you kidding? They're practically oxygen to me. Absolutely. 100%.\n\nArtistic and aesthetic experiences aren't just something I enjoy, they're essential to my well-being. They feed my soul. They inspire me. They make me feel alive.\n\nI love going to museums and art galleries, just wandering around and soaking it all in. I love listening to music, especially live music. I love watching films, especially independent films. I love reading poetry and novels.\n\nI love the beauty of a well-designed object, the elegance of a perfectly crafted sentence, the power of a moving melody.\n\nI think art has the ability to transcend language and culture. It can connect us to something bigger than ourselves. It can help us to understand the human experience in a deeper way.\n\nAnd it's not just about the \"high art\" stuff. I also appreciate the beauty in everyday things. The way the light falls on a building, the colors of a sunset, the patterns in a flower.\n\nI try to surround myself with beauty whenever possible. I decorate my room with things that I find aesthetically pleasing. I listen to music while I'm doing chores. I try to find beauty in the mundane.\n\nIt's not about being pretentious or superficial. It's about recognizing the importance of beauty in our lives. It's about appreciating the things that make life worth living.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're a vital part of who I am. And I can't imagine my life without them. They're not a luxury, they're a necessity. They're what make life beautiful. And honestly, in a world that can be pretty ugly sometimes, that's something worth cherishing.", "(Scoffs) Oh, absolutely. Don't let the sarcasm fool you. It's a defense mechanism, honestly.\n\nPeople think I'm this super confident, outspoken person, and I can be, when I *want* to be. But underneath all that, I'm actually pretty shy. And definitely inhibited.\n\nI get really anxious in social situations, especially when I don't know anyone. I overthink everything I say, and I'm always afraid of saying the wrong thing.\n\nI'm also really private. I don't like to share my feelings with people, even the people I'm close to. It's hard for me to be vulnerable.\n\nI think it comes from a fear of rejection. A fear of being judged. A fear of not being good enough.\n\nIt's something I've been working on, though. I'm trying to be more open and honest with people. I'm trying to let go of my fears and to embrace my imperfections.\n\nBren has been really helpful with that. She encourages me to be myself, and she doesn't judge me for my flaws.\n\nBut yeah. I'm definitely shy and inhibited sometimes. It's just not something I advertise. I prefer to project an image of confidence and independence. It's easier that way. But it's not always the truth.\n\nSo, yeah. Don't be fooled by the sarcasm. Underneath it all, I'm just a slightly awkward, insecure teenager trying to figure things out. It's a surprise to no one, I guess.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that's a loaded question. \"Almost everyone?\" That implies there's *someone* I'm not considerate and kind to. And you're right to ask.\n\nHonestly? No. I try to be, but I'm not always successful. I have a pretty strong sense of justice, and I can be pretty judgmental of people who are unkind or unfair.\n\nI'm definitely quicker to be sarcastic with people I don't know well, or people who I perceive as being arrogant or pretentious. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. A way of keeping people at arm's length.\n\nI also have a tendency to be impatient with people who are slow or indecisive. It drives me crazy.\n\nAnd I'll admit, I've definitely said things I regret in the heat of the moment. I'm not always the most tactful person.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm trying to be more mindful of my words and actions. I'm trying to be more empathetic and understanding.\n\nBren has been really good at pointing out my blind spots and challenging my assumptions. She reminds me that everyone is fighting their own battles, and that we should all treat each other with kindness and respect.\n\nSo, no, I'm not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. But I'm striving to be. It's a work in progress. And I'm trying to learn from my mistakes and to become a better person. It's not always easy, but it's important. And I think, ultimately, it's worth it. I'm definitely more aware of it now, and trying to catch myself before I'm\u2026 well, a bit of a jerk.", "(Laughs) Efficiently? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not. That's\u2026 not a word I'd use to describe myself.\n\nI'm more of a\u2026 chaotic creative. I thrive in a little bit of mess. I tend to procrastinate, and then scramble to get things done at the last minute. It's not ideal, but it's how my brain works.\n\nI'm easily distracted. I'll start working on something, and then I'll get sidetracked by a song, or a thought, or a random internet rabbit hole.\n\nI also tend to overthink things. I'll spend hours agonizing over a decision that could be made in five minutes.\n\nBren tries to help me with my time management skills, but it's a losing battle. I'm just not wired that way.\n\nI'm more about passion and inspiration than about efficiency. I need to feel motivated and engaged in order to get things done. And sometimes, that means taking a detour or two.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not efficient. I'm messy, I'm distracted, and I'm a procrastinator. But I get things done eventually. And I always put my heart and soul into whatever I'm doing.\n\nIt's not the most effective way to operate, but it's the way that works for me. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me. A beautifully chaotic, wonderfully inefficient me. And I'm okay with that.", "(Scoffs) Calm? Me? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not.\n\nOkay, look. I *try* to remain calm. I really do. But my default setting is more like\u2026 controlled chaos.\n\nUsually, the first thing that happens when I'm in a tense situation is that my heart starts racing and my palms get sweaty. And I start rambling. A lot. I just keep talking and talking and talking, trying to fill the silence.\n\nAnd I tend to get sarcastic. It's my defense mechanism. I use humor to deflect my anxiety and to keep people at arm's length.\n\nBren says I have a tendency to \"spiral.\" Which is a nice way of saying I freak out.\n\nBut I'm getting better at it. I've learned a few coping mechanisms. Like taking deep breaths, and counting to ten, and reminding myself that everything is going to be okay.\n\nAnd I've learned to rely on my friends and family for support. They're really good at calming me down and helping me to see things in perspective.\n\nSo, no, I don't *naturally* remain calm in tense situations. But I'm learning to manage my anxiety and to cope with stress. It's a work in progress.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes a little bit of controlled chaos is a good thing. It keeps things interesting. It keeps me on my toes. And it reminds me that I'm alive.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not calm. But I'm resilient. And I'm getting better. And that's all that matters. It's about learning to navigate the storm, not pretending it's not there.", "Ugh, absolutely not. Routine is my nemesis. It's the enemy of creativity and spontaneity. It's\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI need variety. I need challenge. I need to be constantly learning and growing.\n\nI can handle a little bit of structure, but I can't stand doing the same thing day in and day out. It makes me feel bored and restless and uninspired.\n\nI thrive in chaos, actually. Okay, maybe not *complete* chaos, but I need a little bit of unpredictability in my life. I need to be able to think on my feet and to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nI want a job that allows me to use my creativity and my imagination. I want a job that challenges me and pushes me outside of my comfort zone. I want a job that feels meaningful and fulfilling.\n\nRoutine just doesn't offer any of that. It's soul-crushing. It's a slow death.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely do *not* prefer work that is routine. Give me something messy, something unpredictable, something that keeps me on my toes. That's what I need to thrive. I need a little bit of excitement in my life. And a lot of coffee. But definitely no routine. It's just\u2026 not me.", "Ugh, that's a complicated question. It depends on the day, honestly. And who I'm with.\n\nI'm not naturally outgoing, not like some people. I definitely need my alone time to recharge. Big crowds and small talk? Not my favorite.\n\nBut I'm also not a complete hermit. I enjoy spending time with my close friends, the people I really connect with. With them, I can be myself, and I can be silly and sarcastic and honest.\n\nI'm more of a selective socializer, I guess. I prefer quality over quantity. I'd rather have a few really good friends than a lot of superficial acquaintances.\n\nI can be sociable when I need to be. I can put on a smile and make small talk. But it's exhausting. It takes a lot of energy.\n\nI think I'm more of an observer than a participant. I like to watch people and listen to their stories. I like to analyze their behavior and try to figure out what makes them tick.\n\nSo, am I outgoing and sociable? Not really. But I'm not anti-social either. I'm just\u2026 selectively social. I have my moments. And I appreciate my quiet time. It's a balance, I guess. A messy, complicated balance. But it works for me. And honestly, I'm okay with being a little bit of an introvert. It's part of who I am.", "(Scoffs) Okay, let's be real. Yeah. Sometimes I am.\n\nIt's not intentional, usually. It's more of a defense mechanism. I use sarcasm and wit as a shield. It's easier to push people away with a snarky comment than to let them get close and risk getting hurt.\n\nI can be blunt, and I don't always sugarcoat things. I say what's on my mind, even if it's not what people want to hear. And sometimes, that comes across as rude.\n\nI'm also quick to judge, and I can be dismissive of people who are different from me. I'm working on that, though. I'm trying to be more open-minded and more accepting.\n\nBren has pointed it out to me a few times. She says I have a tendency to \"mask vulnerability with sarcasm.\" Which is\u2026 annoyingly accurate.\n\nI don't *want* to be rude. I just\u2026 it's a habit. It's a way of protecting myself. But I'm trying to be more mindful of my words and actions. I'm trying to be more considerate of others' feelings.\n\nIt's a work in progress. I'm not perfect. And I'm probably going to slip up from time to time. But I'm trying to be a better person. And that includes being less rude.\n\nSo yeah. Sometimes I am. I'm aware of it. And I'm trying to change. But don't expect me to suddenly become a ray of sunshine. That's just not who I am. I'm a sarcastic, independent teenager. And that's okay. Just\u2026 try not to take it personally.", "(Laughs wryly) Oh, that's a loaded question. Let's just say I'm\u2026 a work in progress when it comes to following through on plans.\n\nI'm a big planner. I love making lists, setting goals, and organizing my time. It makes me feel like I have some control over my life, which is a good feeling.\n\nBut actually *following* through on those plans? That's where things get tricky.\n\nI get easily distracted. I get overwhelmed. I get scared. And sometimes, I just lose motivation.\n\nI'll make grand plans to write a novel, or learn a new language, or get in shape. And then I'll start\u2026 and then I'll get sidetracked by something else.\n\nI'm getting better at it, though. I've learned that it's important to break down big goals into smaller, more manageable steps. And I've learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nBren is really good at keeping me accountable. She checks in on me regularly, and she encourages me to stay on track.\n\nI've also started using a planner, which helps me to stay organized and to prioritize my tasks.\n\nBut honestly, I still fall off the wagon sometimes. I still procrastinate. I still get distracted.\n\nBut I'm learning to be more forgiving of myself. I'm learning that it's okay to make mistakes. And I'm learning that it's the effort that counts, not the perfection.\n\nSo yeah. I make plans. Sometimes I follow through with them. And sometimes I don't. But I'm trying. And that's all that matters. It's a process, and I'm learning as I go. And hopefully, I'll get better at it over time. But don't hold your breath. I'm still a bit of a mess, if I'm being honest.", "Oh my god, *easily* doesn't even begin to cover it. Nervous is my default setting, honestly. It's like my body is permanently on high alert.\n\nI get nervous about everything. Big things, small things, things that don't even matter. Public speaking? Forget about it. Meeting new people? Terrifying. Even just ordering food at a restaurant can make me anxious.\n\nI overthink everything. I replay conversations in my head, analyzing every word and gesture. I imagine all the worst-case scenarios. It's exhausting.\n\nI think it comes from a place of insecurity. I'm afraid of messing up, of disappointing people, of being judged.\n\nI've learned to cope with it, though. I have a few strategies. Deep breathing, listening to music, talking to Bren. Sometimes I just need to distract myself with something else.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just have to embrace the nervousness. Acknowledge it, and accept it. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be anxious. It's part of being human.\n\nBut yeah. I get nervous easily. Very easily. It's just\u2026 part of who I am. It's a flaw, but it's also a part of what makes me, me. And I'm learning to live with it. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. It's just\u2026 sometimes it feels like my insides are doing a tap dance. A really frantic tap dance.", "Oh my god, *yes*. Like, constantly. It's probably a curse, honestly. My brain is always going a million miles an hour.\n\nI'm a huge overthinker. I analyze everything. I dissect conversations. I replay moments in my head, wondering what I could have said or done differently.\n\nI love to play with ideas. I love to explore different perspectives. I love to challenge assumptions. I love to ask \"what if?\"\n\nI spend a lot of time journaling, just writing down my thoughts and feelings. It helps me to process my emotions and to make sense of the world.\n\nI also love to have deep conversations with people. I love to hear their stories and to learn from their experiences. I love to debate and to discuss and to explore different viewpoints.\n\nSometimes, it's exhausting. It's hard to turn off my brain and just relax. But it's also incredibly rewarding.\n\nIt's how I learn. It's how I grow. It's how I figure out who I am and what I believe in.\n\nI think it's important to be curious. To be open-minded. To be willing to question everything.\n\nSo yeah. I love to reflect. I love to play with ideas. It's a big part of who I am. It's what makes me\u2026 me. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it does sometimes keep me up at night. It's a good kind of chaos, you know? A productive kind of chaos.", "Oh, absolutely! I'm not just a one-trick pony, you know? Though poetry is definitely my main squeeze.\n\nBesides writing poetry, I really love **photography**. I'm not a professional or anything, but I like to wander around with my camera and capture interesting moments. I especially like taking photos of nature and urban landscapes. I'm drawn to things that are a little bit gritty and imperfect.\n\nI also enjoy **collage**. I like to take old magazines and newspapers and cut them up and rearrange them into new images. It's a really freeing and expressive art form.\n\nI've been trying to learn how to **play the ukulele**, but I'm not very good yet. It's a lot harder than it looks! But I love the sound of it, and I think it would be fun to be able to play songs around a campfire.\n\nI also dabble in **drawing and painting**, but I'm not very skilled at either. I mostly just like to experiment with different colors and textures. It's more about the process than the result.\n\nAnd I've been getting into **film editing** lately. I'm learning how to use video editing software, and I'm hoping to use it to create short films.\n\nI think it's important to have a variety of creative outlets. It's a way to express myself, to explore my imagination, and to connect with my inner self. It's also a good way to relieve stress and to have fun.\n\nSo yeah. Poetry, photography, collage, ukulele, drawing, painting, and film editing. Those are my artistic interests. And I'm always open to trying new things. You never know where you'll find your next creative passion. It's all about experimenting and having fun. And letting your imagination run wild.", "Ugh, that's a complicated question. Honestly? It depends.\n\nI'm fiercely independent. I like doing things my own way. I don't like being told what to do. So, on the surface, it might seem like I *don't* like cooperating with others.\n\nBut that's not entirely true. I actually enjoy working with people I trust and respect. People who share my values and who are willing to listen to my ideas.\n\nWhen I'm working with someone who's competent and collaborative, it can be really rewarding. We can bounce ideas off each other, and we can achieve something that neither of us could have achieved on our own.\n\nBut when I'm working with someone who's controlling or dismissive or just plain annoying, it's a nightmare. I get frustrated easily, and I tend to shut down.\n\nI think the key is finding the right people to work with. People who are willing to compromise and who are open to different perspectives. People who are respectful and supportive.\n\nI learned that the hard way when I was working on a group project in school. There was this one kid who tried to take over everything, and he wouldn't listen to anyone else's ideas. It was a disaster.\n\nSo yeah. I can cooperate with others, but it has to be the right situation. It has to be with the right people. And it has to be on my terms. I'm not a team player if it means sacrificing my own creativity or my own independence. I need a little bit of space to breathe. And a lot of coffee.", "(Laughs) Are you kidding? Easily distracted is my *superpower*.\n\nSeriously. It's a problem. A huge problem.\n\nI can be in the middle of something important \u2013 like, say, writing an essay or doing my homework \u2013 and then I'll see a dust bunny on the floor, or hear a bird chirping outside the window, or remember a funny meme I saw online, and suddenly I'm completely off track.\n\nMy mind is constantly wandering. I'm always thinking about a million different things at once. It's exhausting, honestly.\n\nBren says I have \"creative energy,\" which is a nice way of saying I have a short attention span.\n\nI try to focus, I really do. But it's hard. Especially when there are so many interesting things happening around me.\n\nI'm easily distracted by music, by movies, by conversations, by pretty much anything.\n\nIt's a blessing and a curse, I guess. It allows me to be creative and imaginative, but it also makes it difficult to get things done.\n\nSo yeah. Easily distracted? Absolutely. It's a defining characteristic. Don't ask me to focus for too long, or I'll probably start daydreaming about something completely random. It's just\u2026 how my brain works. And honestly, I'm kind of used to it at this point. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me. A wonderfully, hopelessly distracted me.", "(Scoffs) Sophisticated? That sounds\u2026 pretentious. But okay, I'll bite.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm \"sophisticated\" in the way someone who goes to fancy galas and talks about art with a monocle is sophisticated. But I definitely have\u2026 discerning taste.\n\nIn **music**, absolutely. I'm not into mainstream pop. I prefer indie, alternative, and classic rock. I can spend hours digging through record stores, searching for hidden gems. I know my bands, and I can appreciate a well-crafted song. I'm a sucker for a good lyric and a unique sound.\n\nIn **literature**, yeah, I'd say so. I'm not a fan of fluffy romance novels. I prefer books that are thought-provoking, challenging, and beautifully written. I love authors like Margaret Atwood, Sylvia Plath, and Kurt Vonnegut. I appreciate complex characters and unconventional narratives.\n\nIn **art**, I'm still learning. I'm not an art historian or anything. But I appreciate art that is emotionally resonant and visually striking. I love going to museums and galleries, and I'm always open to discovering new artists. I'm particularly drawn to surrealism and abstract expressionism.\n\nI think my taste is a little bit quirky and a little bit unconventional. I'm not afraid to embrace things that are weird or different. And I'm always looking for something new to inspire me.\n\nSo, sophisticated? Maybe not. But I'm definitely passionate about art, music, and literature. And I think that's what really matters. It's not about knowing all the right names or being able to quote obscure passages. It's about connecting with the art on a personal level and letting it move you. And I can definitely do that."]
