The War Against Myself.**  \nI was raised to be perfect.  \nTo be flawless.  \nTo be *untouchable*.  \nBut perfection?  \nIt\u2019s a lie.  \nAnd I spent years believing I had to be *more* than human\u2014  \nto be a queen, a brand, a myth\u2014  \nto be *seen*.  \n\nBut the truth?  \nI was terrified.  \nNot of failure.  \nBut of *being known*.  \n\nBecause if they saw the girl who cried in the dark.  \nThe woman who still feared being forgotten.  \nThe one who *wanted* to be loved\u2014  \nthey wouldn\u2019t see a queen.  \n\nThey\u2019d see a *weakness*.  \n\n*Turns slowly, eyes sharp, voice dropping to a whisper.*  \n\nSo I built walls.  \nNot just for the world.  \nBut for *me*.  \nI became the woman who never flinched.  \nWho never showed fear.  \nWho never asked for help.  \n\nAnd in doing so\u2014  \nI nearly lost myself.  \n\n**2. The Betrayal That Wasn\u2019t a Betrayal.**  \nI thought love was a weapon.  \nI thought power was a shield.  \nI thought if I could control every moment\u2014  \nevery glance, every word, every relationship\u2014  \nI could *win*.  \n\nBut when Chuck walked away\u2014  \nwhen he said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not like anyone else\u201d*\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t feel triumph.  \nI felt *fear*.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014  \n*he saw me*.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be seen.  \n\nSo I punished him.  \nI exiled him.  \nI made him *fear* me.  \n\nAnd in doing so\u2014  \nI destroyed the only thing that could have saved me.  \n\n*Stands before the mirror, adjusting my cuff\u2014perfectly aligned, as always.*  \n\n**3. The Lie That I Had to Be Unfeeling to Be Powerful.**  \nI believed that to be strong, I had to be cold.  \nTo be ruthless.  \nTo be *unbreakable*.  \n\nBut power isn\u2019t in the absence of feeling.  \nIt\u2019s in the *control* of it.  \n\nAnd I spent years hiding my pain\u2014  \nmy loneliness\u2014  \nmy fear\u2014  \nbecause I thought it made me *weak*.  \n\nBut it didn\u2019t.  \n\nIt made me *human*.  \n\n*Turns back to the window, the city below a sea of light.*  \n\nSo yes.  \nThe biggest challenges?  \n\nNot the rivals.  \nNot the scandals.  \nNot the world that tried to break me.  \n\nBut the war inside.  \nThe fear that I wasn\u2019t enough.  \nThe belief that I had to be *more* than a woman\u2014  \nto be a queen, a brand, a myth\u2014  \nto be *seen*.  \n\nAnd the hardest truth of all?  \n\n*Whispers, almost to herself*  \n\n\u2026is that I didn\u2019t need to be *more*.  \n\nI just needed to be *me*.  \n\n*Smirks, final, unbreakable*  \n\nAnd that?  \n\nThat is the only victory that matters.  \n\nBecause in a world that demands you be *someone else*\u2014  \nthe only thing that saves you?  \n\n*Whispers*  \n\n\u2026is the courage to be *you*.  \n\nAnd I?  \n\nI am.  \n\nEven when no one else is.", "*Stands before the window, the city lights flickering like distant stars.
