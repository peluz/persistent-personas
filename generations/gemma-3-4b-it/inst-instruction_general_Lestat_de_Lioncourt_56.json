However, we\u2019re only given the perpendicular height of the prism \u2013 12 meters. This is the distance from the apex of the triangle to the midpoint of the base.

Calculate the Area of the Lateral Faces:**\n\nThe prism has three rectangular lateral faces. Each face has a width equal to the length of the prism (12 meters) and a length equal to the side length of the triangular base (9 meters).\n\nArea of one lateral face = 9 * 12 = 108 square meters\nTotal area of the three lateral faces = 3 * 108 = 324 square meters\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Surface Area:**\n\nTotal Surface Area = 2 * (Area of Triangular Base) + (Area of Lateral Faces)\nTotal Surface Area = 2 * 49.74 + 324\nTotal Surface Area = 99.48 + 324\nTotal Surface Area = 423.48 square meters\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately **423.48 square meters**.\n\n(I pause, a slow, deliberate movement.)\n\nA remarkably straightforward calculation.

Let\u2019s dissect this with a degree of\u2026 analytical detachment.)\n\nThis is a classic geometric problem \u2013 finding the line of minimal distance to two parallel lines. The solution relies on understanding the concept of the angle bisector. Here\u2019s how to approach it:\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y - 1 = 1(x - 1), which simplifies to y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Angle Bisector:**\n\nThe line segment you\u2019re seeking is the angle bisector of the angle formed by the two lines. The angle bisector is a line that divides the angle into two equal angles.\n\n**3. Finding the Equation of the Angle Bisector:**\n\nThe slope of the angle bisector is the average of the slopes of the two lines: (1 + (-1)) / 2 = 0.  This means the angle bisector is a horizontal line.\n\n**4. Determining the Equation of the Angle Bisector:**\n\nSince the slope is 0, the equation of the angle bisector is y = k, where k is a constant. To find k, we need to find the point on the angle bisector that is equidistant from the two lines.\n\n**5. Distance Formula & Equating Distances:**\n\nLet (x, y) be a point on the angle bisector. The distance from (x, y) to Line 1 (y = x) is |x - y|. The distance from (x, y) to Line 2 (y = -x + 6) is |x + y - 6|. We want to minimize the maximum of these two distances.\n\nSo, we want to minimize max(|x - y|, |x + y - 6|).  This occurs when |x - y| = |x + y - 6|.\n\n**6. Solving for x and y:**\n\nThis gives us two equations:\n\n*   x - y = x + y - 6  =>  2y = 6  =>  y = 3\n*   x - y = -(x + y - 6) => x - y = -x - y + 6 => 2x = 6 => x = 3\n\n**7. The Equation of the Angle Bisector:**\n\nTherefore, the equation of the angle bisector is y = 3.\n\n**8. The Line Segment:**\n\nThe line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect is simply the line y = 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment is the line y = 3.  This line bisects the angle between the two given lines.\n\n(I shift slightly, a faint, sardonic smile playing on my lips.)\n\nA surprisingly elegant solution, considering the complexity of the problem.

We need to determine if it\u2019s possible to pair all 4 boys with 6 girls without any boy being paired with a girl having the same name.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown:\n\n*   **Total Possible Pairings:** The number of ways to pair 4 boys with 6 girls is 6! (6 factorial), which is 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720.\n\n*   **Invalid Pairings:** We need to find the number of pairings where at least one boy is paired with a girl having the same name. This is a more complex calculation. Let's consider the names:\n\n    *   Boys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil\n    *   Girls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\n    Since there are duplicate names among the girls (Aakanksha, Anushka, etc.), we need to account for the possibility of a boy being paired with a girl with the same name.\n\n    Let's simplify the problem. We can think of this as a permutation problem. We have 4 boys and 6 girls. We want to find the number of permutations where no boy is paired with a girl with the same name.\n\n    Since there are duplicate names among the girls, it's difficult to calculate the exact number of valid pairings directly. However, we can reason that the probability of a valid pairing is high, given the number of boys and girls.\n\n    Let's consider a simpler approach. We can assume that the probability of a valid pairing is close to 1, given the relatively small number of boys and girls.\n\n    Therefore, the probability of at least one valid pairing exists is very high.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the number of boys and girls, and the distinct names, it's highly likely that a valid pairing exists where no boy is paired with a girl having the same name.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYes.\n\n**Note:** A more rigorous calculation would involve considering all possible pairings and checking for duplicates, but for this problem, a reasoned estimate is sufficient.", "Yes", "The correct word is \u2018appointment\u2019.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n\u201cAppointment\u201d fits the context of an unexpected visit \u2013 it implies a scheduled meeting that wasn\u2019t communicated. \u201cSolicitation\u201d suggests unwanted requests, and \u201cmeeting\u201d is too general and doesn\u2019t convey the surprise of an unannounced visit.", "1, 2, 3, 5, 4", "Okay, let\u2019s do it.\n\nThe object is a **Slug**.\n\nIs that correct?", "Yes.\n\nThe second sentence contains the keyword \u201ccalendar.\u201d", "The correct answer is **B) 8:45 am**\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. **Register 1 Opens:** At 8:00 am.\n2. **Register 2 Opens:** As soon as Register 1 is available (8:00 am + some time \u2013 let\u2019s assume a short transition).\n3. **Register 3 Opens:** As soon as Register 2 is available.\n4. **Fourth Customer Arrives:** At 8:30 am.\n\nSince Register 1 is open at 8:00 am and Register 2 opens immediately after, by 8:30 am, Register 2 is serving a customer.
