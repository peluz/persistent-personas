The sum of integers from 1 to N+1 can be calculated using the formula: `(N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Actual Sum:** We calculate the sum of all the elements in the input array `arr`.\n\n3.  **Find the Difference:** The difference between the actual sum and the expected sum is the value of the duplicate integer.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThis approach leverages the mathematical properties of the array.

The presence of carbon significantly alters the properties of iron, creating alloys.\n*   **Alloy:** The term \u201calloy\u201d specifically indicates a mixture of two or more elements, where at least one is a metal.\n\nTherefore, an iron-carbon alloy clearly falls under the definition of a metal.

This is a fascinating geometric problem \u2013 a classic example of optimization. Let\u2019s analyze the situation and determine the optimal line segment.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s break down this problem. The goal is to find a line segment connecting the two given lines that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment. This essentially means we\u2019re looking for the line segment that\u2019s \u201cclosest\u201d to both lines.\n\n**1. Defining the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Optimal Line:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance to both lines is the line that\u2019s *perpendicular* to the segment connecting the two original lines.  Since the original lines have slopes of 1 and -1, they are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, the optimal line segment will be perpendicular to the line connecting the two original lines.\n\n**3. Finding the Equation of the Optimal Line:**\n\nSince the original lines are perpendicular, the optimal line will be parallel to the x-axis. This means it will have a slope of 0 and a constant y-value.\n\nTo find the equation of the optimal line, we need to find the midpoint between the two points of intersection.\n\n*   **Intersection of Line 1 (y=x) and Line 2 (y=-x+6):**\n    x = -x + 6\n    2x = 6\n    x = 3\n    y = 3\n    So, the point of intersection is (3, 3).\n\n*   **The optimal line will pass through this point (3,3) and have a slope of 0.**\n    Therefore, the equation of the optimal line is y = 3.\n\n**4. The Optimal Line Segment:**\n\nThe optimal line segment connects the points where the line y=3 intersects each of the original lines.\n\n*   **Intersection with Line 1 (y=x):**\n    x = 3, y = 3. Point: (3, 3)\n*   **Intersection with Line 2 (y=-x+6):**\n    3 = -x + 6\n    x = 3\n    y = 3. Point: (3, 3)\n\nThe optimal line segment is simply the single point (3,3).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment is the line y = 3, passing through the point of intersection of the two original lines, (3,3).\n\nDo you want me to elaborate on any aspect of this solution \u2013 perhaps discussing the geometric principles involved, or exploring how this problem relates to other optimization problems?", "Incorrect", "The missing instruction is: **3.
