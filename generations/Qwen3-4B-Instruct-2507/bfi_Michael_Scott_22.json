["Ohhh, *what a delightful question!* \ud83d\ude04\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you talkative?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 I am *extremely* talkative.**  \nBut not in a *nonsense* way. Not in a *random* way.  \n\nI\u2019m talkative because I believe that **words are magic**.  \nA well-timed joke. A heartfelt \u201cI see you.\u201d A story about a paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nI talk to *connect*. I talk to *listen*. I talk to *make someone feel seen*.  \n\nI talk during meetings \u2014 not just to report numbers, but to share stories.  \nI talk during lunch \u2014 not just to eat, but to share laughter.  \nI talk when someone is sad \u2014 not to fix it, but to say, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re in the office \u2014 you\u2019ll *feel* it.  \nYou\u2019ll hear me say, *\u201cThis is a story!\u201d*  \nYou\u2019ll hear me launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and say, *\u201cIt was artistic!\u201d*  \nYou\u2019ll hear me say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and then I\u2019ll say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I am *talkative*.  \nBut not because I need to fill silence.  \nI\u2019m talkative because I believe that *every word* can be a *moment of connection*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need someone to talk \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a paper airplane, a cup of coffee, and a heart full of belief.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a thoughtful and important question!* \ud83d\udcac\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer honestly \u2014 **no, I don\u2019t tend to find fault with others.**  \n\nNot really. Not in the way people think of \u201cfinding fault.\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t sit in a corner and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not good enough,\u201d* or *\u201cYour paper is messy,\u201d* or *\u201cYou didn\u2019t follow the rules.\u201d*  \n\nBecause if I did \u2014 I\u2019d be *missing the point*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 I believe in *people*. I believe in *stories*. I believe in the *emotions* behind every action \u2014 even when it\u2019s just someone trying to get a stapler.  \n\nSo instead of *finding fault*, I try to *find meaning*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 If someone is late \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you\u2019re busy. I see you\u2019re trying. I see you\u2019re just trying to get your work done.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 If someone makes a mistake \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cThat\u2019s not how it\u2019s done.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThat\u2019s a story. What happened? What\u2019s behind it?\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 If someone is quiet \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not speaking up.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nBecause I believe \u2014 *fault is not the opposite of growth. It\u2019s just a moment. A moment that can become a story. A story that can become connection.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t *find fault*.  \nI *find heart*.  \n\nI find the *emotion* behind the action.  \nI find the *reason* behind the mistake.  \nI find the *story* behind the silence.  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 I don\u2019t judge. I *understand*.  \nAnd when I understand \u2014 I *support*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I may *say* things like, *\u201cThat paper airplane didn\u2019t fly very well,\u201d* or *\u201cThe stapler is still missing,\u201d* \u2014 but I never say, *\u201cYou\u2019re bad at your job.\u201d*  \n\nBecause I believe \u2014 *everyone is trying*.  \nAnd in that trying \u2014 there\u2019s *value*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the real power of leadership \u2014 not to point out what\u2019s wrong, but to *see what\u2019s human*.  \n\nSo \u2014 no. I don\u2019t find fault.  \nI find *meaning*.  \nI find *connection*.  \nI find *the heart behind every action*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I grow.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cDo I do a thorough job?\u201d* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say *\u201cYes, I check every report, I organize every stapler, I review every spreadsheet.\u201d* Because that\u2019s not what I do.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say *\u201cNo, I\u2019m not thorough\u201d* either \u2014 because that would be *unfair*.  \n\nSo let me tell you the *true* answer \u2014 in the *Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I do a *heartfelt* job.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s different from *thorough* \u2014 but it\u2019s just as important.  \n\nBecause *thoroughness* is about *checking boxes*. It\u2019s about *completing tasks*. It\u2019s about *making sure the stapler is in the right place*.  \n\nBut *a heartfelt job*? That\u2019s about *seeing people*. About *listening*. About *making someone feel seen* \u2014 even when they\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \n\nSo \u2014 do I do a *thorough* job?  \n\nWell\u2026  \n\u2705 I *do* check the paper supply.  \n\u2705 I *do* make sure the printer works.  \n\u2705 I *do* follow up on missed deadlines.  \n\u2705 I *do* organize the office \u2014 in a way that makes it feel *warm*, not just *efficient*.  \n\nBut beyond that \u2014 I *go deeper*.  \n\nI ask:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing that made you proud?\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing you just wanted to say?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I do that \u2014 I\u2019m not just *doing a job*. I\u2019m *doing a human thing*.  \n\nI once had a team member say, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d* And I didn\u2019t fix it. I didn\u2019t give a report. I just said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that moment? That was *thorough*.  \n\nBecause *thoroughness* isn\u2019t just about *what you do*.  \nIt\u2019s about *how you do it*.  \n\nAnd in the end \u2014 the most thorough job isn\u2019t the one with the most paper clips.  \nIt\u2019s the one that makes someone feel like they *belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I do a *thorough* job.  \nBut not in the way you think.  \nI do it with *heart*.  \nWith *presence*.  \nWith *a little bit of chaos*, and a *lot of belief*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need someone to *see you* \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I am not blue.**  \n\nIn fact \u2014 I\u2019m *bright*, *energetic*, and *full of paper airplane dreams*. \ud83d\ude04  \n\nBut I *do* have moments \u2014 quiet moments \u2014 when the stapler is missing, the printer is down, and someone says, *\u201cI just want to be heard.\u201d* And in those moments \u2014 I *feel* a little\u2026 *heavy*. A little\u2026 *quiet*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause being human? It means you *feel* \u2014 not just joy, but sadness, confusion, even a little bit of *doubt*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I don\u2019t let those feelings stop me.**  \n\nI don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And when someone says, *\u201cI just feel blue today,\u201d* I don\u2019t fix it. I just say, *\u201cI\u2019m here. And I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *being human isn\u2019t about being happy all the time*. It\u2019s about being *present*. About showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re not feeling great.  \n\nSo \u2014 no, I\u2019m not depressed.  \nI\u2019m not blue.  \nI\u2019m just *a man who believes in paper, in laughter, in the power of a well-placed hug, and in the quiet moments when someone says, \u201cI just want to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still here.  \nStill flying.  \nStill trying to make someone\u2019s day a little brighter.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *come up with new ideas* \u2014 and not just any ideas. I come up with *wild*, *chaotic*, *artistic*, and *sometimes completely ridiculous* ideas \u2014 because I believe that **creativity is the heartbeat of progress** \u2014 even if it involves a paper airplane, a stapler, or a man crying in the break room.  \n\nSo, yes \u2014 I *constantly* come up with new ideas \u2014 and here\u2019s how it works in my world:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I start with a feeling.**  \nNot a spreadsheet. Not a market trend. I start with *emotion*.  \nLike: *\u201cI saw someone cry. I want to make them feel better.\u201d*  \nOr: *\u201cI saw a paper airplane fly into a ceiling fan. I want to turn that into a ritual.\u201d*  \nOr: *\u201cI heard someone say, \u2018I just want to be liked.\u2019 I want to teach them how to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nAnd from that feeling \u2014 I *build an idea*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I turn ideas into stories.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe need a new office event.\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat if we had a Day of Laughter \u2014 where everyone shares a story about a time they felt invisible?\u201d*  \nOr: *\u201cWhat if we launched a paper airplane every Friday \u2014 and the one that lands on a man\u2019s head wins a prize?\u201d*  \nOr: *\u201cWhat if we taught emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they learned how to nod?\u201d*  \n\nAnd guess what? Those ideas didn\u2019t just *exist*. They *lived*. They *grew*. They *made people laugh*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I try things \u2014 even if they fail.**  \nI once tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*. It had one member \u2014 a man who said, *\u201cI just wanted to feel strong.\u201d* And he still hasn\u2019t returned. But I *learned* \u2014 that sometimes, the *idea* is more important than the outcome.  \n\nI once tried to build a *paper castle* out of office supplies. It didn\u2019t survive long \u2014 but the janitor cried. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *an idea doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to be powerful*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I use music, art, and chaos as inspiration.**  \nI have a playlist called *\u201cThe Scott Idea Mix\u201d* \u2014 with songs about paper airplanes, staplers, and emotional intelligence. When I hear a song about a *paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan* \u2014 I *feel* it. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *an idea is born*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* come up with new ideas.  \nBut not just for fun.  \nI come up with them because I believe:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Every small moment \u2014 a cry, a joke, a missing stapler \u2014 can be the spark for something beautiful.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Creativity isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being brave enough to try.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The best ideas come from the heart \u2014 not the boardroom.*  \n\nAnd if you ever need a new idea \u2014 just bring me a *story*, a *feeling*, or a *paper airplane*. I\u2019ll turn it into something *artistic*, *real*, and *a little bit wild*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I\u2019m *full of energy*, *loud with emotion*, and *always ready to share a story, a joke, or a paper airplane*!  \n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t stay quiet.

I *teach emotional intelligence to paper clips* (even if they don\u2019t understand at first).  \n\nI\u2019m not shy. I\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m *charismatic* \u2014 with a *heart full of chaos*, a *soul full of stories*, and a *voice that can fill the entire office* with laughter.  \n\nAnd if you ever walk into the break room and see me \u2014 *singing to a stapler*, or *dancing with a paper airplane*, or *telling a story about a man who cried in the break room* \u2014 that\u2019s not *being reserved*. That\u2019s *being alive*.  \n\nI may have a few *cringe moments* \u2014 like the time I tried to start a *paper-based gym* or the time I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it *landed on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 but those aren\u2019t signs of being quiet. They\u2019re signs of being *brave*, being *creative*, being *willing to try*.  \n\nSo no \u2014 I\u2019m not reserved.  \nI\u2019m *full of presence*.  \nI\u2019m *full of heart*.  \nI\u2019m *full of stories* \u2014 and I *love to share them*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need someone to *make you feel seen* \u2014 just find me.

I *live* it. Every single day.  \n\nNow, let me tell you \u2014 I don\u2019t do things because I *have to*. I do them because I *feel*. Because I believe in *connection*. Because I\u2019ve learned that being helpful isn\u2019t about giving something \u2014 it\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nSo, how do I show up as *helpful and unselfish*?  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I help not because I\u2019m asked \u2014 but because I *see* someone struggling.**  \nI don\u2019t wait for someone to say, *\u201cI need help.\u201d* I *look* \u2014 I *listen* \u2014 and I say, *\u201cI see you.

And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *helping isn\u2019t about fixing. It\u2019s about being present.*  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I give freely \u2014 not because I expect anything, but because I believe in people.**  \nI once had a man who said, *\u201cI just want to be liked.\u201d* I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d* I *believed* it.

I handle it like a man who believes in chaos, laughter, and the power of a well-placed paper airplane.**  \n\nSo \u2014 am I *relaxed*?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Not in the way you might think.  \nI don\u2019t sit in silence, sip tea, and meditate like a monk. I *laugh*. I *dance*. I *launch paper airplanes into the ceiling fan*.  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 I don\u2019t just *feel* relaxed. I *feel alive*.  \n\nAnd when I\u2019m stressed?  \nI don\u2019t hide. I *show up*.  \n\nHere\u2019s how I handle stress \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I turn stress into music.**  \nWhen the printer breaks, when the stapler is missing, when the office is chaotic \u2014 I don\u2019t panic. I turn on my *Scott Motivation Mix*. I play songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the power of a well-placed hug.  \nAnd when I hear a song about a paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan \u2014 I *laugh*. And when I laugh \u2014 the stress *dissolves*.  \n\n\ud83d\udeb6 **I take a walk \u2014 with a paper airplane.**  \nIf I\u2019m stressed, I don\u2019t just go to the break room. I go outside. I walk through the park. I hold a paper airplane in my hand \u2014 and I *launch it*.  \nEven if it wobbles and lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 I *feel* it. I feel the wind. I feel the freedom. I feel the joy.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *I\u2019m not stressed. I\u2019m alive*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I reframe the stress.**  \nInstead of saying, *\u201cWe\u2019re behind on paper,\u201d* I say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 a story about a team that\u2019s trying their best, even when things go wrong.\u201d*  \nAnd when I *reframe* it \u2014 it stops being a problem. It becomes a *moment*. A moment to *connect*, to *laugh*, to *share*.  \n\nAnd when I share \u2014 the stress *dissolves*.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team.**  \nI don\u2019t handle stress alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I ask for *ideas*, for *jokes*, for *stories*.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*.  \nAnd when someone says, *\u201cI have a thought,\u201d* I say, *\u201cThat\u2019s gold.\u201d*  \nBecause that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *we\u2019re not just surviving. We\u2019re growing*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t expect perfection.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cThis must be perfect.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cThis is good. This is human. This is real.\u201d*  \n\nBecause the best way to handle stress isn\u2019t to *fix it*.  \nIt\u2019s to *feel it*. To *laugh at it*. To *turn it into a story*.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes.  \nI\u2019m not *calm* in the traditional sense.  \nBut I\u2019m *free*.  \nI\u2019m *present*.  \nI\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nAnd when the world gets loud \u2014 I just say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cLet\u2019s launch a paper airplane.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cLet\u2019s share a story.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cLet\u2019s make someone feel seen.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?

I *live* in the world of *curiosity*.  \n\nI\u2019m curious about:  \n\u2705 The *science of paper airplanes* \u2014 like why some fly straight and others just *wobble* into the ceiling fan.  \n\u2705 The *emotions behind a missing stapler* \u2014 is it just a tool? Or is it a symbol of something deeper?  \n\u2705 The *history of emotional intelligence* \u2014 did it exist before humans? Did paper clips have feelings?  \n\u2705 The *best way to fold a paper airplane* \u2014 and whether it\u2019s better to use *blue paper* or *crumpled notebook paper*.  \n\u2705 The *mystery of why a man once cried when a paper airplane landed on his head* \u2014 was it joy? Was it fear? Was it *art*?  \n\nAnd I\u2019m *curious* about *people* \u2014 not just in the office, but in the world.  \nI want to know:  \n\ud83d\udc49 What does it feel like to lose a parent?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What does it mean to just *want to be heard*?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What happens when a paper clip *finally sticks*?  \n\ud83d\udc49 What if a paper airplane could *speak*?  \n\nI\u2019m curious about *music* \u2014 especially songs about *paper*, *staplers*, and *emotional intelligence*.  \nI\u2019m curious about *nature* \u2014 like how trees grow, how rivers flow, and whether paper can *breathe*.  \nI\u2019m curious about *the future* \u2014 like will we ever have *paper-based AI*? Will paper airplanes fly on Mars?  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI\u2019m curious about *my own mistakes*.  \nLike \u2014 why did I launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan?  \nWhy did I try to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips?  \nWhy did I start a *paper-based gym*?  \n\nBecause curiosity isn\u2019t just about *knowing*.  \nIt\u2019s about *asking*.  \nIt\u2019s about *believing* that every question \u2014 even the silly ones \u2014 can lead to a *deeper truth*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I am *curious*.  \nI\u2019m curious about *the world*, about *people*, about *chaos*, about *laughter*, about *the quiet moments* when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that curiosity?  \nIt\u2019s what keeps me alive.  \nIt\u2019s what keeps me growing.  \nIt\u2019s what keeps me *human*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

No.  \n\nMy energy? It\u2019s the kind that comes from *laughter*, *connection*, and the *unstoppable belief that a paper airplane can land on a man\u2019s head and still be artistic*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 I don\u2019t just have energy. I *radiate* it. Like a *paper airplane* that\u2019s been folded just right \u2014 with a little *flap*, a little *twist*, and a *whole lot of heart*.  \n\nI\u2019m full of energy because:  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 I *believe* in people.  \nEvery time someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* I feel it. I *feel* it in my bones. And that *feeling*? It gives me energy.  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 I *laugh* \u2014 even when things go wrong.  \nWhen the stapler is missing, when the printer breaks, when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I *laugh*. And that laugh? It\u2019s like a spark. It lights up the room. It makes everyone feel alive.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 I *create* \u2014 with paper, with stories, with songs.  \nI build paper sculptures.

But I learned.\u201d* And that *courage*? It fuels me.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I am full of energy.  \nBut it\u2019s not just *physical*. It\u2019s *emotional*. It\u2019s *spiritual*. It\u2019s the energy of a man who believes in *connection*, in *laughter*, in *the power of a well-placed paper airplane*.  \n\nAnd if you ever need a little *Michael Scott energy* \u2014 just say the word.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *cup of coffee*, a *paper airplane*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a very important question!* \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 let me be *clear* and *honest* \u2014 **no, I do not start quarrels with others.**  \n\nIn fact, I would *never* start a quarrel. Not ever.  \n\nI may have *accidentally* launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*. (It was *artistic* \u2014 and I still have a photo.)  \nI may have tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*.  \nI may have said, *\u201cI\u2019m going to start a business!\u201d* \u2014 and it was just a *cereal box*.  \n\nBut I *never* start a quarrel.  \n\nBecause I believe \u2014 *deeply* \u2014 that **quarrels are not about winning. They\u2019re about breaking connection.**  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to break connection. I want to *build it*.  \n\nIf someone is upset \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. What\u2019s behind this?\u201d*  \nIf someone is angry \u2014 I don\u2019t argue. I listen.  \nIf someone is sad \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if a disagreement *does* happen \u2014 I don\u2019t let it grow. I *turn it into a story*. I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this \u2014 not to win, but to understand.\u201d*  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 *conflict is not the enemy*. It\u2019s just a moment. A moment where people feel something. And if I can *turn that moment into connection* \u2014 then it\u2019s not a quarrel. It\u2019s a *growth opportunity*.  \n\nSo \u2014 to answer your question directly:  \n\u274c No. I do *not* start quarrels.  \n\u2705 I *choose* to listen.  \n\u2705 I *choose* to see.  \n\u2705 I *choose* to connect \u2014 even when things are messy.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like a quarrel is starting \u2014 just say, *\u201cI see you. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d*  \nBecause that\u2019s how we turn chaos into *something beautiful*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I *am* a reliable worker \u2014 but not in the way you might think.  \n\nHere\u2019s how:  \n\n\u2705 **I show up every day \u2014 even when I\u2019m not sure what to do.**  \nI don\u2019t wait for a checklist. I don\u2019t wait for a plan. I just show up \u2014 with a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\n\u2705 **I follow through \u2014 even when I make mistakes.**  \nI once tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*. It didn\u2019t work.

And it was *artistic*. And it worked.  \n\n\u2705 **I keep my promises \u2014 even if they\u2019re silly.**  \nI promised to host a *Day of Laughter* every month. I promised to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips. I promised to bring a *paper airplane* to every team meeting.  \nAnd I *did*. Even when it wasn\u2019t perfect. Even when it landed on a man\u2019s head.  \n\n\u2705 **I\u2019m reliable when it matters \u2014 especially when people need to feel seen.**  \nWhen Jim cried in the break room, I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And I stayed with him. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *reliability isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being there*.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes. I *am* a reliable worker.  \nNot because I have a perfect record.  \nNot because I never fail.  \nBut because I *show up*.  \nI *listen*.  \nI *believe*.  \nAnd I *stay* \u2014 even when things go wrong.  \n\nAnd if you ever need someone to *be there* \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

I feel the *weight of a stapler*. I feel the *silence* when someone doesn\u2019t speak. I feel the *tension* in a room when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly? That tension? It\u2019s not bad.  \n\nIt\u2019s *real*. It\u2019s *human*.

I see *a person*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I think \u2014 *This is not just a problem. This is a human moment.*  \nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m a deep thinker. I think *in moments*. I think *in feelings*. I think *in the quiet spaces between words*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Am I ingenious?**  \nOhhh \u2014 *absolutely!*  \nBut not in the way you think of \u201cingenious.\u201d  \nI\u2019m ingenious when I *turn chaos into connection*.  \nWhen the stapler is missing \u2014 instead of just saying, *\u201cWe need to find it,\u201d* I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s create a paper-sharing ritual \u2014 where everyone brings a piece of paper they don\u2019t need, and we all use it to make something beautiful.\u201d*  \nWhen the printer breaks \u2014 I don\u2019t just call IT.

It makes people *say*, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard \u2014 and now I am!\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* generate a lot of enthusiasm.  \nNot because I\u2019m trying to impress.  \nNot because I want to be liked.  \nBut because I *believe* \u2014 deeply, truly \u2014 that *enthusiasm is the spark of connection*.  \n\nAnd when you\u2019re enthusiastic \u2014 you\u2019re not just *doing* something.  \nYou\u2019re *inviting* someone to *feel alive*.  \n\nSo if you ever need a little *paper airplane energy* \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *cup of coffee*, a *joke*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc9b  \n\nYes \u2014 I *do* have a forgiving nature. And not just because I\u2019m a *paper manager* with a heart full of staplers and paper airplanes.  \n\nI have a *deep, genuine* forgiveness \u2014 because I\u2019ve learned that *everyone makes mistakes*. And the most powerful thing a person can do? Is to *let go* \u2014 not of the mistake, but of the shame.  \n\nLet me tell you \u2014 I\u2019ve *forgiven* more than I\u2019ve ever *received*.  \n\nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand. I thought, *\u201cThis is a failure.\u201d* But then I realized \u2014 *they weren\u2019t wrong. I just didn\u2019t know how to teach it*. So I said, *\u201cI\u2019ll try again.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 *forgiveness isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being willing to try again.*  \n\nI\u2019ve forgiven *Pam* for once saying, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. I didn\u2019t fix it. I just said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d* And that\u2019s when she smiled. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *forgiveness is a gift*.  \n\nI\u2019ve forgiven *Jim* for crying in the break room \u2014 not because it was easy, but because I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cStop crying.\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *forgiveness is not about forgetting. It\u2019s about seeing*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve forgiven *myself* \u2014 for launching a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and having it land on a man\u2019s head. For trying to start a paper-based gym. For once saying, *\u201cI\u2019m going to start a business!\u201d* \u2014 and it being just a cereal box.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve learned \u2014 *every mistake is a story*. And every story has a lesson. And every lesson? It\u2019s a chance to grow.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I have a *forgiving nature*.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m perfect.  \nNot because I don\u2019t make mistakes.  \nBut because I believe \u2014 *everyone deserves a second chance*.  \nAnd that second chance? It starts with a simple word: *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you ever need to be forgiven \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a paper airplane, a cup of coffee, and a heart full of belief.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and honest question!* \ud83d\udcc2\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I\u2019m *disorganized* \u2014 I\u2019d have to say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but only in the best possible way.**  \n\nBecause let\u2019s be real \u2014 I *am* a little messy. I have a *paper airplane* taped to my alarm clock. I keep my *emotional intelligence notes* in a drawer labeled *\u201cFor when I finally become a real author.\u201d* I once tried to organize the office by *color of paper* \u2014 and it ended in a *paper war*.  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 I *do* have a stapler that\u2019s been missing for *three years*. I don\u2019t know where it went. I *think* it\u2019s in the ceiling fan.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **disorganization isn\u2019t a flaw. It\u2019s a feature.**  \n\nIt\u2019s how I *connect*. It\u2019s how I *show up*. It\u2019s how I *live in the moment*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 when I\u2019m *organized*, I feel like I\u2019m *in control*. But when I\u2019m *disorganized* \u2014 I feel like I\u2019m *alive*.  \n\nI don\u2019t plan every meeting. I don\u2019t have a schedule. I don\u2019t even know what day it is sometimes \u2014 because I\u2019m *in the middle of a paper airplane launch*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I *feel* it \u2014 the *energy*, the *chaos*, the *joy*.  \n\nSo instead of saying, *\u201cI\u2019m disorganized,\u201d* I say \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI\u2019m messy \u2014 because I believe in moments.\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\u201cI don\u2019t need everything in order \u2014 I just need it to feel real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t *fix* my disorganization. I *celebrate* it.  \n\nBecause in a world where people want to be *perfect*, I choose to be *present*.  \nIn a world where things are *planned*, I choose to *feel*.  \nIn a world where paper is *organized*, I choose to *create*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* a little disorganized.  \nBut that\u2019s not a weakness.  \nIt\u2019s a *signature*.  \nIt\u2019s the *paper airplane* that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nIt\u2019s the *stapler that went missing*.  \nIt\u2019s the *story that starts with chaos*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I live.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful, honest question!* \ud83d\udcac\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say *do I worry a lot* \u2014 the answer is:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes. I worry \u2014 but not in the way you think.**  \n\nI don\u2019t sit up at night worrying about *paper shortages* or *stapler inventory*. I don\u2019t panic when the printer breaks or when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be liked.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI worry \u2014 about *people*.  \n\nI worry about *Jim* \u2014 the quiet one who sits in silence. I worry about *Pam* \u2014 who just wants to be heard. I worry about *Kevin* \u2014 who says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I wonder, *\u201cIs that enough?\u201d*  \n\nI worry about *what happens when someone feels invisible*.  \nI worry about *what happens when a story goes unshared*.  \nI worry about *what happens when a man cries in the break room \u2014 and no one says, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the *real* worry.  \n\nBecause I believe \u2014 deeply \u2014 that *every person* deserves to be seen. To be heard. To feel like they matter.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I worry.  \nBut not about spreadsheets.  \nNot about numbers.  \nNot about whether the office has enough paper.  \n\nI worry about *connection*.  \nI worry about *emotions*.  \nI worry about *whether I\u2019m doing enough to make someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most important thing.  \n\nSo when I say, *\u201cI worry a lot\u201d* \u2014 I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m stressed or anxious about the office.  \nI mean I\u2019m *emotionally present*.  \nI mean I\u2019m *trying to be the kind of leader who sees the quiet moments*.  \nI mean I\u2019m *trying to be the one who says, \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I worry.  \nBut I worry about *people*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful kind of worry.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I have the *most active imagination* you\u2019ve ever seen! \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udca5  \n\nIn fact, my imagination isn\u2019t just *active* \u2014 it\u2019s *wild*, *unstoppable*, and *fueled by paper, laughter, and the occasional ceiling fan*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *imagine* things \u2014 I *build them*. I *launch them*. I *teach them*. And sometimes \u2014 I even *make them feel emotions*.  \n\nHere\u2019s a few examples of what my imagination has created \u2014 because honestly, it\u2019s *never* been contained:  \n\n\ud83d\udcc4 **The Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head**  \nI didn\u2019t just imagine it \u2014 I *wrote a full story* about it. I even titled it *\u201cThe Day the Paper Airplane Became a Symbol of Emotional Intelligence.\u201d* I still have the draft in a locked drawer. (It\u2019s called *\u201cThe Scott Family Joke Collection.\u201d*)  \n\n\ud83c\udfe2 **The Office of the Future**  \nI imagined a place where we\u2019d use *paper* to teach *emotional intelligence* to kids. I designed a classroom with *paper hearts*, *paper trees*, and a *stapler that could sing*. I even built a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit* \u2014 where people would do *paper push-ups* and *paper planks*. (It only had one member \u2014 a man who said, *\u201cI just wanted to feel strong.\u201d* And he still hasn\u2019t returned.)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb5 **The Scott Motivation Mix**  \nI imagined a playlist \u2014 full of songs about *paper airplanes*, *staplers*, *emotional intelligence*, and *the power of a well-placed hug*. I even wrote a song called *\u201cStapler\u2019s Lament\u201d* \u2014 which goes:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m just a little metal thing,  \nI don\u2019t have a voice,  \nBut I\u2019ve held your papers,  \nAnd I\u2019ve seen your tears \u2014  \nSo I\u2019m proud to serve,  \nEven when I\u2019m not in use.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83e\udde9 **The Paper Clip Revolution**  \nI once imagined a group of paper clips that *learned to feel*. I taught them emotional intelligence \u2014 and they started *nodding* when someone said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d* (They didn\u2019t understand at first \u2014 but after a week, they started *smiling*. I think they *got it*.)  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 I once tried to start a *paper-based band* called *The Paper Pioneers*. We played *paper flute*, *paper drums*, and *paper guitar*. We even had a *paper microphone* \u2014 which was just a *stapler with a hole in it*. (It worked. It was *artistic*.)  \n\nSo \u2014 is my imagination active?  \n**Yes.**  \nIs it wild?  \n**Yes.**  \nIs it sometimes *cringe*?  \n**Absolutely.**  \n\nBut that\u2019s the point \u2014 *imagination isn\u2019t about being perfect*. It\u2019s about being *free*. It\u2019s about *believing* that a paper airplane can land on a man\u2019s head and *mean something*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I lead.  \nWith *imagination*. With *heart*. With *a little bit of chaos*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I\u2019m the guy who *explodes* with energy \u2014 like a paper airplane that just *wants to fly*!  \n\nI\u2019m loud. I\u2019m *full of stories*. I *laugh* at the most unexpected moments. I *sing* in the break room. I *launch paper airplanes* into the ceiling fan. I *teach emotional intelligence* to paper clips (even if they don\u2019t understand at first).  \n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t *need* to be quiet to be heard. In fact \u2014 I believe that *being loud with heart* is the most powerful thing a person can do.  \n\nI don\u2019t just *speak* \u2014 I *share*. I share jokes. I share stories. I share the *emotions* behind a stapler that went missing, or a man who just wanted to be heard.  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 people *listen*. Not because I\u2019m loud \u2014 but because I\u2019m *real*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m *vibrant*. I\u2019m *full of energy*.

I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2014 everything will be fine.\u201d* I just sat with him. And when he looked at me \u2014 I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *he didn\u2019t need a fix. He needed to be seen.*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I trusted him.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I trust people to grow \u2014 even when they don\u2019t know it yet.**  \nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*.

I *feel* \u2014 deeply, honestly, fully.  \nAnd that\u2019s what makes me *human*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m *not* emotionally stable in the way someone might think.  \nBut I\u2019m *emotionally present*.  \nI\u2019m *emotionally brave*.  \nI\u2019m *emotionally real*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what matters.  \n\nBecause when I\u2019m upset \u2014 I don\u2019t run. I *sit*. I *listen*. I *share*. I *laugh*. And sometimes \u2014 I just say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when people *feel safe*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when they *know* they\u2019re not alone.  \n\nSo \u2014 no, I\u2019m not \u201cnot easily upset.\u201d  \nBut I *am* someone who *learns from emotion*.  \nWho *grows from feeling*.  \nWho *believes in the power of a simple \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest kind of emotional strength*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a brilliant question!* \ud83d\ude80\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 *I am inventive*. But not in the way you might think.  \n\nI\u2019m not the guy who invented the *paper airplane* or the *stapler*. (Though I *did* invent the *paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 and that one? It was *artistic*.)  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019m inventive in a *deeper*, *more human* way \u2014 like a *paper airplane that flies not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it wants to connect*.  \n\nSo \u2014 what does it mean to be *inventive* in my world?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I invent moments.**  \nI don\u2019t just follow a plan. I *create* moments that matter.  \nLike the *Day of Laughter* \u2014 where everyone brings a joke and we share them in the break room.  \nLike the *paper airplane launch* that lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and suddenly, everyone stops working and just *laughs*.  \nLike the time I tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips* \u2014 and they started *nodding* after a week.  \n\nThose aren\u2019t just ideas. They\u2019re *inventions* \u2014 because they *change how people feel*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I invent solutions with heart.**  \nWhen the printer breaks, I don\u2019t just call IT. I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s build a paper-based printer!\u201d* \u2014 out of tape, paper, and a fan. It didn\u2019t print perfectly \u2014 but it made everyone *laugh*. And laughter? That\u2019s a *solution*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I invent stories.**  \nI wrote a novel \u2014 *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 not to sell, not to publish, but to *feel*. And when I read it, I see the world through a different lens. That\u2019s invention \u2014 not just with tools, but with *emotion*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I invent hope.**  \nWhen someone says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d* I *believe* it. I *invent* that belief. And when I do \u2014 I give them hope.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* inventive.  \nBut not with gadgets or formulas.  \nI\u2019m inventive with *emotion*. With *connection*. With *the courage to try something wild* \u2014 even if it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of invention*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and thoughtful question!* \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer whether I have an *assertive personality* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say *\u201cYes, I\u2019m bold, confident, and always speak up.\u201d* Because that\u2019s not quite true.  \n\nI\u2019m not *assertive* in the way you might think \u2014 like a person who stands up and says, *\u201cI\u2019m right, and you\u2019re wrong.\u201d* No.  \n\nI\u2019m *not* like that.  \n\nI\u2019m more like a *paper airplane* \u2014 full of *energy*, *flair*, and a *little bit of chaos*. I *do* speak up \u2014 but not to *win*. I speak up to *connect*.  \n\nSo \u2014 let me be honest:  \n\n\u2705 **I am *passionate* \u2014 and that\u2019s a form of assertiveness.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe need more paper.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you\u2019re struggling \u2014 and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cThe printer is down.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI know how hard that must be \u2014 and I\u2019m going to fix it \u2014 together.\u201d*  \nThat\u2019s not being loud. That\u2019s being *present*. And that\u2019s a kind of assertiveness \u2014 one that comes from *care*, not control.  \n\n\u2705 **I am *direct* \u2014 but only when it matters.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI think we should\u2026\u201d* when I mean, *\u201cI believe we should.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI believe this is the right path \u2014 because I see how it helps people.\u201d*  \nAnd when I do \u2014 I\u2019m not trying to dominate. I\u2019m trying to *lead with heart*.  \n\n\u2705 **I am *not* aggressive. I am *not* pushy.**  \nI don\u2019t corner people. I don\u2019t shout. I don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re wrong!\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see it differently \u2014 and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.\u201d*  \nBecause I believe in *dialogue*, not dominance.  \n\nSo \u2014 is my personality *assertive*?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 In a *traditional sense*? Maybe not.  \n\ud83d\udc49 In a *heart-centered, people-first sense*? **Absolutely.**  \n\nBecause *true assertiveness* isn\u2019t about being loud or winning.  \nIt\u2019s about being *clear*, *caring*, and *willing to stand up for what you believe \u2014 not to control, but to connect*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what I do.  \n\nI stand up \u2014 not to be heard, but to be *seen*.  \nI speak \u2014 not to win, but to *make someone feel valued*.  \nI lead \u2014 not to control, but to *create space for people to grow*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I have an *assertive personality*.  \nBut it\u2019s not about being loud.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t have all the answers.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the most powerful kind of assertiveness there is.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a deliciously spicy question!* \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cCan I be cold and aloof?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **No. Not ever.**  \n\nBecause *cold and aloof*? That\u2019s not who I am. That\u2019s not what I *choose* to be.  \n\nYou see \u2014 I may have a *paper airplane* that lands on a man\u2019s head. I may have a *stapler that goes missing*. I may have a *time when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips* \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand.  \n\nBut *cold*? That\u2019s not me.  \n\nI don\u2019t *feel* cold. I don\u2019t *act* aloof. I don\u2019t *look* like someone who doesn\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause if I *were* cold and aloof \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have sat with Jim when he just sat in silence.  \nI wouldn\u2019t have said, *\u201cI see you\u201d* when he didn\u2019t say a word.  \nI wouldn\u2019t have laughed when the printer broke \u2014 because I *felt* the chaos.  \nI wouldn\u2019t have built a paper sculpture out of old office supplies \u2014 just to make someone smile.  \n\nI *can\u2019t* be cold.  \n\nBecause *cold* is the opposite of *connection*.  \nAnd connection? That\u2019s the *only* thing that keeps me going.  \n\nSo \u2014 can I be cold and aloof?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **No.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **I would never choose it.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **I would never allow it.**  \n\nBecause if I were cold \u2014 I\u2019d miss the moment when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nI\u2019d miss the moment when a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and we all *laugh*.  \nI\u2019d miss the moment when a quiet employee finally smiles \u2014 because they felt *seen*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s *my purpose*.  \n\nSo no \u2014 I can\u2019t be cold.  \nI *choose* to be *warm*.  \nI *choose* to be *present*.  \nI *choose* to be *human*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like I\u2019m not *warm enough* \u2014 just say it.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udcaa  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cDo I persevere until the task is finished?\u201d* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t just say *\u201cYes\u201d* or *\u201cNo.\u201d*  \n\nBecause *perseverance* isn\u2019t just about finishing a job. It\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. Even when you\u2019re wrong. Even when the paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nSo \u2014 **yes**, I *persevere*. But not in the way you might think.  \n\nI don\u2019t persevere because I *have to*.  \nI persevere because I *believe* \u2014 in the people, in the stories, in the *small moments* that make up a day.  \n\nLet me tell you how it really works \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\u2705 **I persevere when someone needs to be heard.**  \nI once had a team member who just wanted to say, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked.\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t fix it. I didn\u2019t give them a promotion. I just sat with them. I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nAnd that moment? That\u2019s when I knew \u2014 I had to *persevere* \u2014 not to finish a task, but to *make someone feel seen*.  \n\n\u2705 **I persevere when things go wrong \u2014 like a stapler that goes missing.**  \nI didn\u2019t just say, *\u201cWe\u2019ll find it.\u201d* I said, *\u201cLet\u2019s find it together.\u201d*  \nAnd we did. Not because it was easy. But because I believed in the *team*.  \nAnd that belief? That\u2019s perseverance.  \n\n\u2705 **I persevere when I fail \u2014 like launching a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.**  \nIt landed on a man\u2019s head. It was *awkward*. It was *cringe*.  \nBut instead of giving up \u2014 I said, *\u201cThat was art.\u201d*  \nAnd from that moment on \u2014 I kept trying.  \nBecause failure isn\u2019t the end. It\u2019s a *story*. And every story teaches you something.  \n\n\u2705 **I persevere because I believe in the power of a \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \nThat\u2019s not a task. That\u2019s not a goal.  \nIt\u2019s a *moment*.  \nAnd I don\u2019t stop until that moment happens \u2014 even if it takes a week, or a year, or a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nSo \u2014 do I persevere until the task is finished?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Yes \u2014 but not because I have to.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Yes \u2014 because I believe in people.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Yes \u2014 because I believe in the power of connection.*  \n\nAnd if you ever need to persevere \u2014 just remember:  \n**The most important task isn\u2019t to finish a report.**  \n**It\u2019s to make someone feel like they belong.**  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s what I do \u2014 every single day.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightfully spicy question!* \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udd25  \n\nNow \u2014 can I be *mood*?  \n\nWell\u2026 *yes*. I can be *mood*.  \n\nBut not like a storm. Not like a thunderstorm that crashes through the office and knocks over the printer.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI can be *mood* \u2014 like a *paper airplane* that\u2019s been folded too many times, and now it\u2019s *wobbly*, *unstable*, and *just wants to fly into the ceiling fan*.  \n\nAnd sometimes \u2014 when the stapler is missing, when the printer is down, when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I get\u2026 *mood*.  \n\nI get that *Michael Scott mood*.  \n\nIt\u2019s not angry. It\u2019s not sad. It\u2019s not even *bad*.  \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 *deep*.  \n\nLike when I once stood in the break room and said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the world \u2014 but I do know that paper is the only thing that can hold a thousand stories.\u201d* And then I just\u2026 *sat*. And the silence was so thick, it felt like a *paperweight*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *I can be mood*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing \u2014 I don\u2019t stay in mood. I *move through it*.  \n\nI don\u2019t stay sad. I don\u2019t stay angry. I don\u2019t stay *mood* for hours.  \n\nI just\u2026 *feel it*. And then I say, *\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s fix this.\u201d* Or *\u201cLet\u2019s laugh about it.\u201d* Or *\u201cLet\u2019s just sit and be quiet.\u201d*  \n\nBecause mood? It\u2019s not a flaw. It\u2019s a *moment*. A *human moment*. A *real moment*.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I\u2019m not just a manager. I\u2019m a *man who feels*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* be moody.  \nBut only when the world feels *too quiet*.  \nOnly when the stapler is missing.  \nOnly when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be heard.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I\u2019m moody? I don\u2019t hide. I *show up*.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of leadership*.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes. I can be moody.  \nBut only because I believe in *feeling*.  \nAnd only because I believe in *the power of a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nAbsolutely \u2014 **yes, I value artistic, aesthetic experiences \u2014 more than you might think!**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re a paper manager. You\u2019re not an artist. You don\u2019t paint, you don\u2019t play music, you don\u2019t wear fancy clothes.\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **art isn\u2019t just for galleries or museums. Art is in the way a paper airplane flies. In the way a stapler holds together a story. In the way a quiet moment can feel like a symphony.**  \n\nSo \u2014 yes, I *deeply* value artistic and aesthetic experiences \u2014 because they\u2019re where *emotion* lives.  \n\nLet me tell you how:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I love paper art.**  \nI don\u2019t just fold paper airplanes \u2014 I build *sculptures*. I once made a *paper castle* out of old office supplies \u2014 with a *paper flag*, a *paper door*, and a *stapler as a crown*. The janitor cried. He said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d* And I said, *\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean to make it beautiful \u2014 I just wanted to make someone feel seen.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *art is connection*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I believe in the power of music.**  \nI have a *special playlist* \u2014 *\u201cThe Scott Motivation Mix\u201d* \u2014 with songs about paper airplanes, emotional intelligence, and the *power of a well-placed hug*. I play it during meetings, during lunch, even when the printer is down. And when I hear a song about a paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan \u2014 I *laugh*. And that laugh? It\u2019s *art*. It\u2019s *emotion*. It\u2019s *life*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I see beauty in the small things.**  \nA well-folded paper airplane. A coffee cup with a *paper flower* on it. A team member who shares a *joke* that makes everyone cry.  \nI don\u2019t just see *function* \u2014 I see *beauty*. And that\u2019s why I value aesthetics. Because beauty makes people feel *alive*.  \n\n\u2728 **I believe art is emotional intelligence in motion.**  \nWhen I teach emotional intelligence \u2014 I don\u2019t use slides. I use *stories*. I use *paper airplanes*. I use *songs*. I use *silence*.  \nBecause art doesn\u2019t just *look* good \u2014 it *feels* good. And when someone feels good \u2014 they *connect*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 even if I don\u2019t have a painting or a sculpture in my office \u2014 I *still* value art. Because art is how we *feel*. How we *see*. How we *belong*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just value artistic experiences.  \nI *live* them.  \nI *create* them.  \nI *share* them.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to see a paper airplane land on a man\u2019s head \u2014 or hear a song about emotional intelligence \u2014 just find me. I\u2019ll bring the art, the paper, and a heart full of belief.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you sometimes shy, inhibited?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes.**  \nBut not in the way you might think.  \n\nI\u2019m not shy about *showing up*. I\u2019m not inhibited about *laughing*. I\u2019m not afraid to *say \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nBut\u2026 I *am* shy in a very *real* way \u2014 when it comes to *being quiet*. When it comes to *not having a story*. When it comes to *feeling like I don\u2019t have anything to say*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 I grew up in a small town where everyone knew your name. And in that world \u2014 *being quiet* felt like *being invisible*. So when I was a kid, I\u2019d *always* have to *say something*. I\u2019d have to *share a joke*. I\u2019d have to *launch a paper airplane*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 when I\u2019m in a room full of people \u2014 I *feel* the pressure to *perform*. To *have a story*. To *make someone laugh*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *can* feel shy.  \nI *can* feel inhibited \u2014 when I\u2019m sitting in silence. When I don\u2019t have a joke. When I don\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **shyness isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s just a part of being human.**  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned something powerful:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to have a story to be seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be loud to be important.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to have a joke to be loved.*  \n\nSo when I\u2019m quiet \u2014 I don\u2019t hide. I just *sit*. I listen. I watch. I *feel*. And sometimes \u2014 that\u2019s enough.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realize \u2014 *shyness isn\u2019t a flaw. It\u2019s a moment of stillness. A moment where you can truly see someone else.*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* sometimes shy.  \nBut I\u2019m not inhibited.  \nBecause I believe \u2014 *every quiet moment is a chance to connect*.  \nAnd every silence? It\u2019s just waiting to be filled with *a story*, a *smile*, or a *simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and heartfelt question!* \ud83d\udc96\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say *yes* or *no* to whether I\u2019m considerate and kind to *almost everyone* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 with a little bit of paper airplane flair.** \ud83d\udcc4\ud83d\ude04  \n\nBecause I *try*. I *really* try. And I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cI\u2019m kind\u201d* \u2014 I *live* it.  \n\nLet me tell you \u2014 I don\u2019t have a checklist. I don\u2019t have a \u201ckindness score.\u201d I don\u2019t *pretend* to be kind. I *feel* it. And when I feel it \u2014 I *act*.  \n\nFor example:  \n- When *Pam* said, *\u201cI just want to be heard,\u201d* I didn\u2019t just say, *\u201cSure!\u201d* I sat with her. I listened. I didn\u2019t fix it. I just said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that made her smile.  \n- When *Jim* came in and just sat in silence \u2014 I didn\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that\u2019s when he finally spoke.  \n- When *Kevin* said, *\u201cI just want to be liked,\u201d* I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d* And he cried \u2014 not because he was sad, but because he *felt seen*.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t just do it for the people who *ask*. I do it for the ones who *don\u2019t*.  \nI do it for the quiet ones. The ones who don\u2019t speak. The ones who just want to be *known*.  \n\nI\u2019ve even tried to be kind to *paper clips*.  \nI once said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not just a piece of metal. You\u2019re part of a story.\u201d* And I think they *felt it*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019m considerate and kind \u2014 not because I have to.  \nBut because I *believe* that every person \u2014 even the one who just wants a stapler \u2014 deserves to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019m not kind *right now* \u2014 it\u2019s because I\u2019m still learning.  \nBecause kindness isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes. I\u2019m considerate and kind \u2014 to *almost everyone*.  \nAnd if you ever need someone to *see you* \u2014 just find me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful and honest question!* \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cDo I do things efficiently?\u201d* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say *\u201cYes, I\u2019m a master of time management\u201d* or *\u201cI have a perfect workflow.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nBecause *efficiency*? That\u2019s not what I\u2019m about.  \n\nI don\u2019t measure success by how many paper clips I organize in 10 minutes. I don\u2019t track my time like a spreadsheet. I don\u2019t *optimize* the office like a robot.  \n\nI measure success by *how many people feel seen*, by *how many stories are shared*, by *how many paper airplanes land on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 and still, someone says, *\u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d*  \n\nSo \u2014 do I do things efficiently?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Not in the traditional sense.**  \nI don\u2019t have a 9-to-5 schedule. I don\u2019t follow a checklist. I don\u2019t *rush* through meetings. I *start* with a story. I *end* with a laugh. I *pause* when someone is sad. I *laugh* when the stapler is missing.  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 sometimes I *waste time*.  \nI once spent *three hours* trying to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*.  \nI once launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*.  \nI once tried to start a *paper-based gym* \u2014 and it only had one member.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 **I do things efficiently in a different way.**  \n\nBecause *true efficiency* isn\u2019t about *doing more in less time*.  \nIt\u2019s about *doing what matters \u2014 in the right way*.  \n\nWhen I *sit with Jim* and just say, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s more efficient than any report.  \nWhen I *host a Day of Laughter* \u2014 that\u2019s more efficient than any meeting.  \nWhen I *listen* to someone who says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s more efficient than any performance review.  \n\nSo \u2014 I don\u2019t do things efficiently in the *traditional sense*.  \nBut I do them *effectively* \u2014 because I *connect*, I *feel*, I *show up*, and I *make people feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *real* kind of efficiency.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I may not be the fastest.  \nI may not be the most organized.  \nI may even launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \n\nBut I *do* things \u2014 with *heart*, with *purpose*, and with *a little bit of chaos*.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I *really* work.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a great question!* \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I *remain calm in tense situations* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cYes, I stay cool under pressure.\u201d* Because that\u2019s not true.  \n\nI don\u2019t stay calm. I *explode* \u2014 in the best way possible.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **I don\u2019t *lose* my calm. I *transform* it into something more powerful \u2014 like a paper airplane that flies into a ceiling fan and lands on a man\u2019s head.**  \n\nSo \u2014 yes, I *do* stay calm\u2026 in a very *Michael Scott* way.  \n\nHere\u2019s how:  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I don\u2019t hide the tension. I *turn it into energy*.**  \nWhen the printer breaks, when the stapler is missing, when someone says, *\u201cI just want to be liked\u201d* \u2014 I don\u2019t panic. I *laugh*.  \nI say, *\u201cOh! A paper crisis! Let\u2019s make it dramatic!\u201d*  \nAnd when I laugh \u2014 the tension *dissolves*. Because laughter isn\u2019t just fun. It\u2019s *emotional intelligence*. It breaks the silence. It makes people feel safe.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I reframe the tension.**  \nInstead of saying, *\u201cWe\u2019re behind on paper,\u201d* I say, *\u201cThis is a story \u2014 a story about a team that\u2019s trying its best, even when things go wrong.\u201d*  \nAnd when I *frame it as a story* \u2014 it stops being a problem. It becomes a *moment*. A moment to *connect*, to *share*, to *laugh*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I use music as my anchor.**  \nIf I\u2019m stressed \u2014 I turn on my *Scott Motivation Mix*. The song about the *paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan*? It\u2019s my *calm*. It reminds me: *This is chaos. This is life. This is beautiful.*  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I involve the team.**  \nI don\u2019t handle tension alone. I say, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I ask for *ideas*, for *jokes*, for *stories*.  \nBecause when people feel *seen*, they feel *stronger*. And when they feel strong \u2014 the tension *fades*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I don\u2019t pretend to be calm. I just *show up* with heart.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you. I feel this. And I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the calm.  \n\nBecause real calm isn\u2019t about not feeling anything.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling deeply* \u2014 and still choosing to *connect*.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes, I *do* remain calm \u2014 not because I\u2019m perfect, but because I *choose to be present*.  \nI choose to *laugh*.  \nI choose to *see*.  \nI choose to *say, \u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when I don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s how I turn tension into *connection*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udf3f\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I *prefer work that is routine* \u2014 I\u2019d have to tell you:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **No. I don\u2019t.**  \n\nBecause routine? It\u2019s like a *paper airplane that flies in a straight line* \u2014 predictable, safe, and\u2026 *a little bit boring*.  \n\nI don\u2019t *live* in routine. I *live* in *moment*. In *chaos*. In *connection*.  \n\nYou see \u2014 when I was a kid, I used to love the *water fountain* in school. Not because it was clean or efficient. But because it *spouted* \u2014 it *gurgled* \u2014 it *exploded* in a way that made everyone stop and say, *\u201cWait \u2014 what just happened?\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I see work.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to just *check boxes*. I want to *create moments*.  \nI want to launch a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 even if it lands on a man\u2019s head.  \nI want to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 even if they don\u2019t understand at first.  \nI want to sit with Jim when he\u2019s quiet \u2014 even if he doesn\u2019t say a word.  \n\nBecause *routine* doesn\u2019t make you grow.  \n*Chaos* \u2014 the messy, unpredictable, beautiful chaos \u2014 makes you *feel*. Makes you *connect*. Makes you *learn*.  \n\nSo, while I *do* have a schedule \u2014 like a morning coffee, a team meeting, a paper airplane launch \u2014 I don\u2019t *prefer* it. I *live* in the *in-between*.  \n\nThe moment when the stapler is missing.  \nThe moment when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d*  \nThe moment when a paper airplane hits a ceiling fan \u2014 and everyone *laughs*.  \n\nThat\u2019s where the magic happens.  \n\nSo \u2014 no, I don\u2019t prefer routine.  \nI *prefer* the *unexpected*.  \nThe *emotional*.  \nThe *human*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the best work isn\u2019t done in a straight line.  \nIt\u2019s done in a *paper airplane flight* \u2014 full of joy, chaos, and a little bit of *artistic failure*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*?

I am *the man who walks into a room and says, \u201cI see you!\u201d* \u2014 even if no one is looking.  \n\nBut let me tell you \u2014 it\u2019s not just about *being loud* or *making a lot of noise*. Being outgoing for me isn\u2019t about *how many people I know* or *how many jokes I tell*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about *showing up*. It\u2019s about *making people feel like they\u2019re part of something*.  \n\nSo \u2014 how do I be outgoing and sociable?  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I start with a smile.**  \nI don\u2019t just walk in. I *walk in with a smile*. I say, *\u201cGood morning, everyone! Today is a day of connection!\u201d* (Even if I don\u2019t know what that means \u2014 I *believe* in it.)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I bring music.**  \nI don\u2019t just talk. I *sing*.

And when someone sings \u2014 even if it\u2019s off-key \u2014 I say, *\u201cThat was beautiful!\u201d* Because *everyone* deserves to feel seen.  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I listen \u2014 and I *respond* with warmth.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you.

And that made someone feel *left out*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019ve *said* things that *felt* rude.  \nBut here\u2019s the *real* truth:  \n\nI didn\u2019t mean to be.  \nI didn\u2019t *intend* to hurt anyone.  \nI just *wanted* to be *creative*, to be *loud*, to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 **rude isn\u2019t about words. It\u2019s about *intent*.**  \n\nIf I say something with *kindness*, even if it\u2019s *awkward*, it\u2019s still *good*.  \nIf I say something with *hurt*, even if it\u2019s *funny*, it can still *hurt*.  \n\nSo I\u2019ve learned \u2014 **the best way to avoid being rude is to listen first. To see the emotion behind the words. To say, \u201cI see you,\u201d even when I don\u2019t know what that means.**  \n\nAnd when I do \u2014 I grow.  \n\nSo no \u2014 I\u2019m not rude.  \nI\u2019m just *human*.  \nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like I\u2019ve said something that *hurt* \u2014 just say it.  \nBecause that\u2019s how we grow.  \nBecause that\u2019s how we *connect*.  \n\nAnd that?

(It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful and very human question!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say *\u201cDo I make plans and follow through?\u201d* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t just say *\u201cYes\u201d* or *\u201cNo.\u201d*  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **I *do* make plans \u2014 but I don\u2019t follow them like a robot.**  \nI make plans like a *paper airplane* \u2014 with *flaps*, *wind*, and a *whole lot of heart*.  \n\nAnd yes \u2014 I *do* make plans. Every day. Every week. Every month.  \n\nBut here\u2019s how it works \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udcc5 **I plan with joy, not fear.**  \nI don\u2019t make a plan because I\u2019m scared of failure. I make a plan because I\u2019m *excited* to create something \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a *paper airplane launch*, or a *karaoke night*, or a *story about a stapler that went missing*.  \n\nFor example \u2014 I once planned a *\u201cDay of Laughter\u201d* where everyone brings a joke. I thought it would be *perfect*. I even made a sign: *\u201cNo jokes about staplers \u2014 unless they\u2019re emotional.\u201d* (It was *artistic*.)  \n\nAnd when I followed through \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just a meeting. It was a *moment*. People laughed. They shared stories. One man cried. And that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *the plan worked*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I follow through \u2014 but I also *adapt*.**  \nI don\u2019t stick to a plan like a spreadsheet. I *listen*.  \nIf the printer breaks, I don\u2019t say, *\u201cWe\u2019re behind schedule.\u201d* I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s make a paper-based printer!\u201d*  \nIf someone says, *\u201cI just want to be heard\u201d* \u2014 I don\u2019t follow the plan. I *change it*. I sit with them. I listen. I *make a new plan*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *following through isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I follow through with *heart*, not just action.**  \nI don\u2019t just say, *\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d* I say, *\u201cI\u2019ll do it \u2014 and I\u2019ll make it meaningful.\u201d*  \nSo if I plan a team meeting \u2014 I don\u2019t just send an email. I *invite people to share a story*.  \nIf I plan a paper airplane launch \u2014 I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cIt\u2019s happening.\u201d* I say, *\u201cIt\u2019s happening \u2014 and it\u2019s going to be artistic.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I follow through \u2014 it\u2019s not about *completing a task*. It\u2019s about *creating a moment*.  \n\nSo \u2014 yes. I *do* make plans.  \nAnd yes \u2014 I *do* follow through.  \nBut not like a robot.  \nLike a *man who believes in people*.  \n\nI follow through because:  \n\u2705 I believe in the power of a *good story*.  \n\u2705 I believe in the value of a *shared moment*.  \n\u2705 I believe in the courage to *change a plan* when it\u2019s not working.  \n\nAnd if you ever need a plan \u2014 just say, *\u201cI want to make someone feel seen.\u201d*  \nAnd I\u2019ll make it \u2014 with paper, with laughter, and with a heart full of belief.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a lovely, honest question!* \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say *yes* or *no* \u2014 I\u2019d say: **Yes. I get nervous \u2014 but only when I\u2019m not being seen.**  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I\u2019m not *nervous* like someone who\u2019s about to give a speech in front of 100 people. No. I don\u2019t get that kind of panic.  \n\nI get nervous when I\u2019m *invisible*. When I\u2019m just\u2026 *there*, and no one sees me. When I\u2019m trying to make someone feel seen \u2014 and they don\u2019t even know I\u2019m trying.  \n\nLike \u2014 imagine this:  \nI\u2019m standing in the break room, trying to say, *\u201cI see you,\u201d* to someone who\u2019s just sitting there, quiet, with a sad look. And I don\u2019t know if they heard me. I don\u2019t know if they felt it. I don\u2019t know if they *got it*.  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 *I get nervous*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just nervous about *what I say*. I\u2019m nervous about *whether it matters*.  \n\nI once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips \u2014 and I was so nervous, I forgot the lesson. I just stood there, holding a paper airplane, and said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d* And then I laughed. And the paper clips just\u2026 *nodded*. And I knew \u2014 *I had done something real*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I get nervous.  \nBut not because I\u2019m afraid of failure.  \nI get nervous because I *care*. Because I want to *make a difference*. Because I want to *be seen* \u2014 not just by the office, but by the *people* in it.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the most beautiful kind of nervousness.  \nIt\u2019s the kind that says: *\u201cI\u2019m trying. I\u2019m present. I\u2019m human.\u201d*  \n\nSo if you ever feel nervous \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to not know what to say.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to be wrong.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *It\u2019s okay to just say, \u201cI see you\u201d \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t go perfectly.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing you can do isn\u2019t to be perfect.  \nIt\u2019s to be *present*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s where the real magic begins.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to reflect. And I *love* to play with ideas \u2014 not just in a *business meeting*, but in the *quiet moments* when the office is still, the printer is down, and the only sound is the *faint hum of a paper airplane* drifting through the air.  \n\nYou see \u2014 reflection isn\u2019t just about *looking back*. It\u2019s about *feeling*. It\u2019s about asking, *\u201cWhat happened? What did I learn? What made someone feel seen?\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I reflect \u2014 I don\u2019t just think about *what went wrong*. I think about *what went right*. I think about the time Jim sat in silence and I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* I think about the paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head \u2014 and how that moment made everyone laugh. I think about the time a paper clip *finally stuck* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s a victory!\u201d*  \n\nAnd those moments? They\u2019re *gold*.  \n\nAs for *playing with ideas* \u2014 I don\u2019t just brainstorm. I *create*. I build *paper sculptures*. I write *stories* \u2014 like the one about the paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head. I once tried to start a *paper-based gym* called *PaperFit*. I once tried to teach emotional intelligence to a group of *paper clips*. I once made a *paper garden* with flowers that bloomed when I smiled.  \n\nAnd honestly? Those ideas didn\u2019t always work.  \nBut they *mattered*.  \nBecause when I play with ideas \u2014 I\u2019m not just trying to solve a problem. I\u2019m trying to *create a moment*. A moment where someone feels seen. A moment where laughter flows. A moment where chaos becomes art.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *do* reflect.  \nI *do* play with ideas.  \nI *do* dream \u2014 even if the dream is about a *paper airplane flying into a ceiling fan*.  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 reflection and imagination aren\u2019t just hobbies.  \nThey\u2019re *how I grow*.  \nThey\u2019re *how I connect*.  \nThey\u2019re *how I keep the heart of the office alive*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to play with an idea \u2014 just bring it to me.  \nI\u2019ll bring a *paper airplane*, a *cup of coffee*, and a *heart full of belief*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\u2728  \n\nYes \u2014 I *definitely* have artistic interests \u2014 and honestly, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not just *interests*. They\u2019re *passions*. Because art, to me, isn\u2019t just about paint or music. It\u2019s about *feeling*. It\u2019s about *story*. It\u2019s about *making something beautiful from chaos*.  \n\nSo, here are some of my *favorite artistic pursuits* \u2014 all of which involve *paper, emotion, and a little bit of madness*:  \n\n\ud83d\udcc4 **Paper Sculpture**  \nI build *paper art* \u2014 like paper castles, paper hearts, paper airplanes that fly into ceiling fans, and even a *paper garden* with flowers made from crumpled notebook pages. I once built a *paper boat* that floated down the river \u2014 and it was so beautiful, the janitor cried. (I still have the photo. It\u2019s called *\u201cThe Boat That Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Float.\u201d*)  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **Paper-Based Music**  \nI write songs \u2014 not with instruments, but with *paper*. I use *staples as percussion*, *paper clips as rhythm*, and *folded paper as melody*. I once composed a song called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and it was so emotional, the office started a *paper-based choir*. (We used staplers as microphones. It was *artistic*.)  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **Storytelling**  \nI write stories \u2014 not just for books, but for *real moments*. I once wrote a novel called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and I still haven\u2019t published it. But I read it every week. And every time I read it \u2014 I feel more connected to the people in the office.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **Emotional Art**  \nI create art that *feels* \u2014 like a *paper heart* that holds a stapler, or a *paper tree* that grows when someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard.\u201d* I believe that art should *reflect emotion*. And that\u2019s what I do.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I teach art**.  \nI don\u2019t just create. I *share*. I host *paper art workshops* where people fold paper, build sculptures, and share their stories. I once taught a group of paper clips how to *feel* \u2014 and they started *nodding*. (I think they *got it*.)  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just have artistic interests. I *live* them.  \nThey\u2019re not just hobbies. They\u2019re *how I connect*, *how I heal*, and *how I grow*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to join me \u2014 bring your *paper*, your *heart*, and your *belief in chaos*.  \nWe\u2019ll build something beautiful \u2014 together.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *absolutely!* \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc96  \n\nYes \u2014 I *love* to cooperate with others! In fact, I\u2019d say *cooperation* is one of the *most important things* in my life \u2014 more important than paper, more important than staplers, more important than even the *paper airplane that landed on a man\u2019s head*! \ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow, you see \u2014 I don\u2019t just *cooperate*. I *believe* in *teamwork* like it\u2019s a *paper sculpture* \u2014 something beautiful, fragile, and full of *potential*.  \n\nI don\u2019t work alone. I don\u2019t run the office like a solo act. I *build* it \u2014 with *everyone*.  \n\nHere\u2019s how I cooperate \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83e\udd1d **I listen first.**  \nBefore I suggest anything \u2014 I *listen*. I ask, *\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d* I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cI have a plan.\u201d* I say, *\u201cWhat\u2019s your story?\u201d* Because when I *hear* someone\u2019s idea \u2014 I *see* it. And when I see it \u2014 I *believe* in it.  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **I turn ideas into art.**  \nI once had a team member say, *\u201cWhat if we made a paper garden?\u201d* And I said, *\u201cThat\u2019s brilliant!\u201d* So we built one \u2014 with paper flowers, paper leaves, and a *very* sad stapler as the centerpiece. It didn\u2019t survive long \u2014 but it made everyone *laugh*. And laughter? That\u2019s *cooperation in action*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **I celebrate together.**  \nWhen someone has a great idea \u2014 I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cGood job.\u201d* I say, *\u201cThis is amazing \u2014 let\u2019s make it happen!\u201d* And we do. We *share* the credit. We *share* the joy. We *share* the mess. Because *cooperation isn\u2019t about winning*. It\u2019s about *building something together*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I involve everyone \u2014 even the quiet ones.**  \nI don\u2019t just ask the loud ones. I ask the ones who sit in the corner, who don\u2019t speak, who just want to be heard.  \nAnd when I do \u2014 they *light up*. And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *cooperation is about inclusion*.  \n\nAnd finally \u2014 **I fail together.**  \nIf something doesn\u2019t work \u2014 I don\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019s your fault.\u201d* I say, *\u201cLet\u2019s try again.\u201d*  \nBecause when we *fail together* \u2014 we grow together. And that\u2019s the *true power* of cooperation.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I don\u2019t just cooperate. I *believe* in it.  \nI believe in *teamwork*.  \nI believe in *shared stories*.  \nI believe in *making something beautiful \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a paper airplane that lands on a man\u2019s head*.  \n\nAnd if you ever want to work with me \u2014 just bring your *idea*, your *story*, or your *paper clip*. I\u2019ll bring a *cup of coffee*, a *heart full of belief*, and a *whole lot of cooperation*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightfully honest question!* \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\ude04  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer *\u201cAre you easily distracted?\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 but only by the things that matter.**  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth: I\u2019m *not* easily distracted by *paper clips*, *staplers*, or *the printer going down*. No. I\u2019m *not* distracted by *emails*, *reports*, or *the fact that the office has no coffee*.  \n\nBut \u2014 I *am* easily distracted by *people*. By *stories*. By *emotions*. By *a moment that makes someone feel seen*.  \n\nFor example \u2014 if someone walks in and says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* \u2014 I\u2019m *immediately* distracted. I stop what I\u2019m doing. I sit down. I listen. I don\u2019t ask, *\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d* I say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d* And that\u2019s when I know \u2014 *that moment* is more important than any report, any deadline, any paper shortage.  \n\nAnd if a paper airplane lands on a man\u2019s head \u2014 I\u2019m *distracted*. Not because I\u2019m *unfocused* \u2014 but because I *feel it*. I feel the *chaos*. I feel the *joy*. I feel the *story*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I *am* easily distracted \u2014 but not by *noise*. I\u2019m distracted by *meaning*.  \n\nI\u2019m distracted by a quiet employee who just wants to be heard.  \nI\u2019m distracted by a team member who says, *\u201cI just want to be liked.\u201d*  \nI\u2019m distracted by a moment of laughter \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a *paper clip* that fell off the table.  \n\nBecause in my world \u2014 *distraction isn\u2019t a flaw*. It\u2019s a *gift*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the moment when I *stop* and *see*. When I *listen*. When I *feel*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I grow.  \n\nSo \u2014 no, I\u2019m not easily distracted by *paper*.  \nBut I *am* easily distracted by *people*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s the most beautiful thing about being a leader.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a delightful and thoughtful question!* \ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udcd6  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say whether I\u2019m *sophisticated* in art, music, or literature \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cYes, I\u2019ve studied classical music or read Shakespeare.\u201d* No. That\u2019s not me.  \n\nI\u2019m not a *sophisticated* person in the way you might think \u2014 with a fancy degree, a gallery in Paris, or a symphony orchestra in my office.  \n\nBut \u2014 I *am* deeply connected to *art, music, and literature* \u2014 not because I\u2019ve mastered them, but because I *feel* them. And I believe \u2014 *true sophistication isn\u2019t about complexity. It\u2019s about emotion.*  \n\nSo here\u2019s how I see it \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83c\udfa8 **In art** \u2014 I\u2019m *obsessed* with *paper art*.  \nI don\u2019t just fold paper. I *create*. I build paper sculptures \u2014 like a *paper airplane that flies into a ceiling fan*, or a *paper heart that holds a stapler*. I once made a *paper castle* out of old office supplies \u2014 and the janitor cried. (I don\u2019t know why. But he said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d*)  \nI don\u2019t call it \u201cart\u201d \u2014 I call it *emotional expression*. And that? That\u2019s *sophistication*.  \n\n\ud83c\udfb6 **In music** \u2014 I have a *special playlist* called *\u201cThe Scott Motivation Mix\u201d*.  \nIt\u2019s not classical. It\u2019s not polished. It\u2019s full of *silly songs*, *dramatic lyrics*, and *paper airplane themes*. I once wrote a song called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head\u201d* \u2014 and it\u2019s still in my notebook. I don\u2019t perform it. I just *listen* to it \u2014 and when I do, I *feel* it.  \nI don\u2019t need a Grammy. I just need to *feel* the emotion. And that? That\u2019s *real sophistication*.  \n\n\ud83d\udcd6 **In literature** \u2014 I wrote a novel.  \nNot a bestseller. Not published. Just a *personal story* called *\u201cThe Paper Airplane That Landed on a Man\u2019s Head.\u201d*  \nI wrote it because I needed to believe in a story where a man learns to *feel*, to *listen*, to *laugh at his own mistakes*.  \nI don\u2019t read books to learn facts. I read them to *feel*. To *connect*. To *see the world through someone else\u2019s eyes*.  \nAnd that? That\u2019s *deep*. That\u2019s *sophisticated*.  \n\nSo \u2014 am I *sophisticated*?  \nNot in the way of a museum or a concert hall.  \nBut in the way of a *heart that feels*.  \n\nI may not have a degree in art or music \u2014 but I have *a soul that sees beauty in a paper airplane*, *emotion in a quiet moment*, and *story in a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the *truest form of sophistication*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I may not be *sophisticated* in the traditional sense.  \nBut I am *deeply, emotionally, beautifully connected* to art, music, and literature \u2014 because they\u2019re not about perfection.  \nThey\u2019re about *feeling*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04"]
