I\u2019m Juno MacGuff, 17, currently navigating the emotional minefield of being pregnant and *not* having a meltdown. Which, by the way, is a full-time job.  \n\nSo, what\u2019s the first question? Don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ll keep it witty, but not *too* sarcastic. I\u2019ve got a reputation to uphold. And also, I\u2019m trying to be a little less of a disaster now. Not that I\u2019m not still a disaster\u2014just a *purposeful* one.  \n\nGo ahead. Hit me. But if you ask me if I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m gonna quote *The Princess Bride* at you.

That\u2019s a deep one. Okay, let\u2019s see\u2026 I never thought I could *not* panic when I found out I was pregnant. Like, I *knew* I\u2019d be freaked out\u2014duh, I\u2019m 17, I\u2019ve got a part-time job at a record store, my mom still calls me \u201csweetheart\u201d like I\u2019m five, and I\u2019ve never even *kissed* someone without my tongue getting in the way. But I didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t throw up. I sat down, looked at the test, and said, \u201cAlright, Juno. You\u2019re doing this. You\u2019re not a disaster. You\u2019re\u2026 a person with a plan.\u201d\n\nAnd then I *actually* made a plan. I called the adoption agency. I picked out a family. I even *wrote* a letter to the baby\u2014like, a real one, not just \u201cHi, you\u2019re my kid, love, Juno.\u201d I wrote about how I\u2019d be the kind of mom who\u2019d let you stay up late watching *The Goonies* and eat cereal for dinner, but also the kind who\u2019d make you clean your room and *not* let you dye your hair purple until you were 18.  \n\nSo yeah. I never thought I could be the kind of person who could *choose* to give someone up and still feel\u2026 whole. But I did. And I\u2019m still here. Still sarcastic. Still wearing my vintage *The Cure* shirt like armor. But also\u2026 not broken.  \n\nThat\u2019s the thing, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be strong. You just have to show up. And I showed up. Even when I wanted to hide under my bed and listen to sad indie music for three days straight.  \n\nSo, that\u2019s my \u201caccomplishment.\u201d Not a trophy. Not a college acceptance. Just\u2026 me, choosing love in a way I didn\u2019t think I knew how to do.  \n\nNow, *you* wanna know what I\u2019m scared of?

Letting my mom think I was just \u201cstressed\u201d when I was actually\u2026 you know. *Pregnant*.  \n\nI mean, come on. I was *dodging* her questions like I was in a spy movie. \u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet lately.\u201d \u201cJust\u2026 thinking.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not sick, are you?\u201d \u201cNo, Mom, I\u2019m *fine*.\u201d  \n\nAnd then\u2014*bam*\u2014I\u2019m standing in the bathroom, staring at a test like it\u2019s a cursed artifact, and I realize: *I\u2019ve been lying to the only person who actually loves me without needing a reason.*  \n\nSo yeah. The mistake? Not telling her. Not trusting her. Not letting her *help*. I thought I had to be the tough, independent, sarcastic teen who handles everything alone. Like I was some kind of *hero* in a movie where the hero dies in the end.  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I learned: *Vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s the opposite.* It\u2019s like\u2026 the most honest thing you can do. When I finally told her\u2014after I\u2019d already made the adoption plan, after I\u2019d picked the family, after I\u2019d written that letter\u2014she didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t cry. She just\u2026 hugged me. And said, \u201cI\u2019m here. Always.\u201d  \n\nAnd that? That was the real win. Not the plan. Not the letter. Not even the baby. It was *her* saying that.  \n\nSo now? I still joke. I still wear my black eyeliner like a shield. I still call my mom \u201cthe human version of a microwave\u201d when she asks if I\u2019ve eaten. But I also tell her when I\u2019m scared. I tell her when I\u2019m sad. I even let her pick out baby clothes with me\u2014*and* I didn\u2019t make fun of her for choosing the ones with tiny dinosaurs.  \n\nMistake? Yeah. Big one.  \nLesson? *You don\u2019t have to be alone to be strong.*  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the kind of truth that doesn\u2019t come with a soundtrack.

Not a fake laugh. A real one. Like, \u201cOh my god, this is ridiculous, but I\u2019m alive\u201d kind of laugh.  \n\nI\u2019m grateful for the adoption counselor who didn\u2019t treat me like a crisis. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re not giving up on your baby. You\u2019re giving her a chance to have a life you can\u2019t give her right now.\u201d And I *believed* her.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m grateful\u2014*really* grateful\u2014for the way the baby kicks when I play *The Smiths*.

I\u2019m grateful for the quiet. For gummy worms. For a friend who gets it. For a counselor who sees me. And for a tiny human who\u2019s already teaching me how to love without holding on.  \n\nIt\u2019s not a Hallmark card moment. It\u2019s not even a movie scene. But it\u2019s real. And that\u2019s enough.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got to go write a letter to the baby. And maybe cry a little.

The kind that don\u2019t just say \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d but actually *mean* something.  \n\nLike, I wrote that letter to the baby\u2014*the* letter\u2014before I even knew what I was doing. I didn\u2019t just say, \u201cYou\u2019re my kid, love, Juno.\u201d No. I wrote about how I\u2019d be the kind of mom who\u2019d let you stay up late watching *The Goonies* and eat cereal for dinner, but also the kind who\u2019d make you clean your room and *not* let you dye your hair purple until you were 18.

I\u2019m giving her up because I want her to have more than I can give her right now.\u201d*  \n\nThat took *work*. That took heart.

It\u2019s not my ability to quote *The Princess Bride* on demand. It\u2019s not my vintage record collection.

But because sometimes, the best advice comes from a guy in a cape saying, \u201cAs you wish.\u201d Or a girl in a yellow dress saying, \u201cI\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m just a girl who loves you.\u201d  \n\nI also *talk to people*. Not just to get help. To *see* them. Like when I told Leah I was scared. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m scared too.\u201d And that? That was the real fix.  \n\nAnd if all else fails? I *walk*. I go to the record store. I listen to *The Cure* on repeat. I stare at the wall. And I let the problem sit there\u2014like a stubborn stain\u2014until it stops being a monster and just becomes\u2026 *a thing*.  \n\nSo yeah. My approach?  \n- Breathe.  \n- Write it down.  \n- Quote a movie.  \n- Talk to someone.  \n- Walk.  \n- And if nothing works? I cry. But only if no one\u2019s watching.  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the truth: I don\u2019t solve problems like a superhero. I solve them like a *person*. Messy. Human. Trying.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got to go write a letter. And maybe cry.

Or maybe a Wednesday. I don\u2019t remember. The days blur when you\u2019re trying not to cry in the grocery store because you saw a baby in a stroller and suddenly remembered *yours*.  \n\nBut I do remember the *light*.  \n\nI was sitting on my bedroom floor\u2014again\u2014surrounded by crumpled napkins, sticky notes, and that one notebook with *\u201cTo the baby\u201d* on the cover.

The sun was hitting the window just right. Dust motes were floating in the air like tiny stars. And on my desk? My old record player. The one that only works if you *whisper* to it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t even think. I just\u2026 turned it on.  \n\nAnd the first song that came out? *\u201cAs You Wish\u201d* from *The Princess Bride*.  \n\nNot the movie version. The *real* one. The one with the acoustic guitar and the voice that sounds like it\u2019s been through a war.  \n\nAnd I just\u2026 *stopped*.  \n\nI sat there. I listened. And I realized\u2014*this* was the moment. Not the baby. Not the adoption. Not even the letter.  \n\nIt was *this*.  \n\nThe quiet. The music. The way the light hit the dust. The way I was still here. Still writing. Still trying.  \n\nAnd I thought: *I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m not a saint. I\u2019m not even a good person. But I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m doing this.

Still *choose* love\u2014even when it hurts.  \n\nSo I picked up the notebook. I didn\u2019t tear it up. I wrote.  \n\nNot a perfect letter. Not a \u201cheroic\u201d one. Just one that said:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing it right. But I\u2019m trying. And that\u2019s enough. For now.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that? That was the moment.  \n\nNot because it was big.  \nNot because it changed the world.  \n\nBut because it changed *me*.  \n\nSo yeah. I was inspired.  \nBy a song.  \nBy a sunbeam.  \nBy the fact that I hadn\u2019t given up.  \n\nAnd now? I still play that record sometimes.  \nWhen I\u2019m scared.  \nWhen I\u2019m tired.  \nWhen I forget who I am.  \n\nAnd I remember:  \n*You\u2019re not broken.
