["Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always want to know this, like it's some big mystery. It wasn't a mystery to *me*. It was just\u2026the only sensible thing to do.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted for the rest of my life. I was failing band, I was obsessed with mixtapes, and I was pretty sure my biggest problem was whether or not to go to the Snowball.\n\nAnd then\u2026there was a baby.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want the baby, exactly. It was that I knew I couldn't *give* the baby what it deserved. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a stable home, and my parents were\u2026well, they were my parents. They'd support me, sure, but it wouldn't be ideal.\n\nMark, the dad\u2026he was a good guy, but he was leaving for college. He wasn't ready to be a dad either. We both knew that.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it just\u2026made sense. It meant the baby would have parents who were prepared, who could give it everything it needed. A real home, a real family.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. But it wasn't about me. It was about the baby. I wanted the best for it, even if that meant letting it go.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were amazing. They were so excited, so ready. And knowing that they would love and care for the baby\u2026that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt wasn't a glamorous decision. It wasn't a sad movie moment. It was just\u2026practical. And it was the right thing to do. For everyone.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. A lot. It forced me to think about things I never would have thought about before. And it made me realize that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go.", "Ugh, okay, so like, love and responsibility. Big topics. And honestly, I started out knowing pretty much *nothing* about either one. I thought love was just, you know, butterflies and holding hands and making out in the back of a car. And responsibility? That was something my parents nagged me about.\n\nBut then, suddenly, I'm pregnant. And everything changes.\n\nI learned that love isn't just about *feeling* something. It's about *doing* something. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about wanting the best for them, even if it means letting them go. That's what Mark and Vanessa showed me. They weren't perfect, but they genuinely wanted to give this baby a good life, and they were willing to work for it. It wasn't some grand romantic gesture, it was just\u2026consistent kindness and commitment.\n\nAnd responsibility? That's not just about doing your chores or getting good grades. It's about facing the consequences of your actions. It's about owning up to your mistakes. It's about making hard choices, even when they suck. I had to decide what was best for this baby, and that meant giving it up. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nI also learned that love comes in all shapes and sizes. It's not just romantic love. It's the love between friends, the love between family members, the love between a couple who are building a life together. Paul showed me that. He wasn't the baby's father, but he was there for me, unconditionally. He didn't judge me, he just supported me.\n\nAnd finally, I learned that growing up isn't about having all the answers. It's about learning to ask the right questions. It's about being open to new experiences. It's about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life. And it's okay to be a little bit messy along the way.\n\nSo yeah, love and responsibility. They're complicated. But they're also pretty amazing. And I'm still figuring it all out, one awkward conversation at a time.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. But don't expect a heartfelt monologue, alright? I'm not exactly known for my emotional vulnerability.\n\nLook, when you find out you're pregnant at sixteen, it's\u2026a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. And everyone has an opinion. And everyone's looking at you. And suddenly, your life is not your own anymore. It's kinda terrifying.\n\nSo, I started using humor. It was a defense mechanism, honestly. If I could make a joke about it, it felt\u2026less scary. It felt like I had some control. Like I wasn't just a victim of circumstance.\n\nIt was also a way to deflect. If people asked awkward questions, or gave me pitying looks, I'd just crack a joke. It threw them off balance. It made *me* feel less vulnerable. It was like, \"Yeah, this is weird, but I can handle it. Don't feel sorry for me.\"\n\nAnd honestly, it helped me connect with people. Paul and Vanessa, they got my humor. They didn't treat me like I was fragile or broken. They just\u2026laughed with me. And that was huge.\n\nIt wasn't about making light of the situation, exactly. It was about finding the absurdity in it. Because sometimes, life is just absurd. And if you can't laugh at it, you'll just cry.\n\nPlus, it's just\u2026me. I've always been sarcastic. It's how I process the world. It's how I make sense of things. So, even when everything was falling apart, I couldn't just turn that off.\n\nSo yeah, my wit helped me cope. It was my shield, my weapon, and my way of staying sane. It didn't solve all my problems, but it made them a little bit easier to bear. And it reminded me that even in the darkest of times, there's always room for a little bit of humor. Even if it's just a little bit twisted.", "Ugh, okay, deep questions. You want the real stuff, huh? Fine. It wasn't all witty banter and sarcastic comments, you know? Underneath all that, I was\u2026a mess. A confused, kinda scared mess.\n\nMy vulnerability, that was the whole thing, wasn't it? I pretended to be all tough and independent, but really, I was just trying to figure out who I was *without* being defined by this\u2026situation. Being pregnant wasn't part of the plan. It wasn't who I thought I was going to be. And suddenly, everyone had an opinion on who I *should* be.\n\nI was scared, obviously. Scared of everything. Scared of being a mom, scared of giving the baby up, scared of what people would think. And I didn't really have anyone to talk to about it, not really. My mom was great, but she had her own stuff going on. And Paul\u2026well, Paul was Paul. Sweet, but not exactly equipped to handle a teenage pregnancy.\n\nSo I built up these walls, you know? The sarcasm, the quick comebacks, the whole \"I'm fine\" act. It was a defense mechanism. But it also kept me from really connecting with people, from letting them see the real me.\n\nThe search for identity\u2026that was constant. I was trying to figure out who I was *outside* of being pregnant. Was I still Juno? Was I still the girl who loved music and vintage clothes and making Super 8 films? Or was I just\u2026a mom now?\n\nIt was through the process of finding a family for the baby that I started to figure things out. Meeting Mark and Vanessa, seeing how much they wanted a child, it made me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a failure. It was an act of love. And it allowed me to reclaim my own life, to pursue my own dreams.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears, a lot of doubts, a lot of awkward conversations. But ultimately, my vulnerability and my search for identity forced me to grow up. They forced me to confront my fears and to make some really tough decisions. And they led me to a place where I could finally be okay with who I was, even if I didn't have all the answers.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, you know? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm learning to embrace the messiness of life, and to be okay with not having everything figured out. And that, I think, is a pretty good place to be.", "Ugh, okay, so people always wanna talk about the \"strength\" thing. Like I just magically woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, I got this.\" It wasn't like that. Not even close. It was\u2026messy. And honestly, I couldn't have done any of it without a few key people.\n\nMy dad, Paul, he was\u2026surprisingly cool about everything. He didn't freak out, he didn't judge. He just kinda listened, and then he started building a crib. Which, you know, was a pretty solid way of showing support. He didn't try to fix things, he just tried to be there. And that meant a lot.\n\nAnd then there was Bren, my best friend. She was the one who made me laugh when I wanted to cry. She was the one who went with me to the doctor's appointments and didn't flinch. She was the one who reminded me that I was still *me*, even with a whole baby situation going on. She didn't sugarcoat anything, but she always had my back.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa, Mark's wife. She was\u2026unexpectedly awesome. I thought she'd be all judgy and weird, but she was really understanding. She helped me pick out baby stuff and gave me advice about\u2026well, everything. She showed me that it was okay to be scared, and that it was okay to ask for help.\n\nSee, before all this, I was kinda\u2026independent. I liked doing things my own way. I didn't really *need* anyone. But this\u2026this was different. This was bigger than me. And I realized that I couldn't do it alone.\n\nTheir support didn't mean they told me what to do. They didn't try to convince me to keep the baby or give it up. They just listened to me, and they helped me figure out what *I* wanted. They gave me the space to make my own decision, and they supported me no matter what.\n\nIt was their belief in me, even when I didn't believe in myself, that gave me the strength to go through with it. It was their love and acceptance that helped me realize that I was capable of more than I thought.\n\nSo yeah, they were pretty important. They weren't just people around me, they were my lifeline. And I wouldn't have gotten through it without them. It's kinda cheesy to say, but it's true.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a party, let me tell you. It wasn't like in the movies, where you're all glowing and happy and suddenly craving pickles and ice cream.\n\nHonestly? I was mostly just\u2026freaked out. Like, full-blown, heart-racing, can't-breathe freaked out. I mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and whether or not Mark would finally ask me to the Fall Dance, not\u2026this.\n\nIt was a really weird mix of feelings. Shock, obviously. And a lot of panic. And then, like, a weird kind of\u2026responsibility? I knew I couldn't just ignore it. I had to do something.\n\nI didn't tell my parents right away. That was\u2026a whole other level of terrifying. I just sat in the bathroom for, like, an hour, staring at the positive pregnancy test and trying to figure out what to do.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It was scary and confusing and overwhelming. But it also\u2026made me think. It made me realize that life is complicated, and sometimes things happen that you don't expect. And you just have to deal with them.\n\nIt wasn't ideal, not even close. But it wasn't the end of the world either. It just\u2026was. And I had to figure out what \"was\" meant for me.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It was a lot. A really, really lot. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. It changed everything.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It definitely shook things up.\n\nWith my parents\u2026that was rough at first. My dad just kinda shut down. He didn't say much, just looked\u2026disappointed. Which, okay, fair. It wasn't exactly what he pictured for me. My mom, she tried to be supportive, but she was also kinda freaking out. Lots of questions about college and my future and\u2026everything. It took a while for them to really come around. They eventually did, though. They're my parents. They love me, even when I make spectacularly bad decisions.\n\nBut my friends\u2026that was different. Leah was amazing. She was just\u2026there. No judgment, just support. She helped me pick out baby names and went to doctor's appointments with me. She's the best. Paul\u2026well, Paul was Paul. He was a good guy, but he wasn't exactly equipped to deal with a pregnant teenager. He tried, though.\n\nIt kinda changed the dynamic, though. I felt\u2026different. Like I was on a different path than everyone else. They were still talking about parties and college applications, and I was thinking about diapers and adoption agencies. It was weird.\n\nI think it made me realize who my *real* friends were. The ones who stuck around, the ones who didn't judge me, the ones who just wanted me to be happy. Those are the people I'll always cherish.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it definitely made me appreciate the people in my life. And it taught me a lot about myself, too. Like, I'm stronger than I thought I was. And I can handle anything, as long as I have good people by my side.\n\nIt was messy, complicated, and totally unexpected. But it was also\u2026good. In a weird way. It forced me to grow up, and it showed me what really matters.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like stumbling through a minefield while trying to balance a stack of books.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were just\u2026numb. Like, total shock. Then came the waves of everything. Fear, mostly. And guilt. And just\u2026being really, really confused. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was talking to someone. Not just anyone, but someone who *got* it. My friend, Leah, was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just listened. And Paul, too. He was\u2026surprisingly supportive. Even though he was kinda clueless at first.\n\nMy dad was\u2026tough. He was mad, obviously. But he also came around. He saw I was trying to do the right thing, even if it wasn't the easiest thing.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa, the social worker. She was\u2026okay. A little bit preachy, but she helped me figure out my options and navigate all the paperwork.\n\nBut mostly, I just tried to be\u2026practical. I focused on what I *could* control. Like, school. And finding a good family for the baby. I didn't want to let this ruin my life, or the baby's life.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. There were days when I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. I cried a lot. I ate a lot of junk food. I listened to a lot of The Moldy Peaches.\n\nI think what really got me through it was realizing I wasn't alone. There were other people who had been through this before. And I could get through it too.\n\nIt wasn't about being brave, or strong, or anything like that. It was about just\u2026taking things one day at a time. And trying to be kind to myself. Because I was a mess, but I was doing the best I could.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up a lot faster than I expected. It wasn't the path I would have chosen, but it made me who I am today. And I'm okay with that.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a sensitive subject. But I'm willing to talk about it if it helps someone else. Because it's important to know that you're not alone.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about this? It was, like, a whole thing, okay? A really personal thing. But fine, I'll explain. It's not like I haven't explained it a million times already.\n\nHavenbrooke was\u2026intimidating. It was all sterile and clinical and full of people who looked like they judged you just for breathing. It felt like a hospital, and I didn't want a hospital. I wanted\u2026something else.\n\nWomen Now felt different. It was quieter. More\u2026respectful. It wasn't trying to shame anyone or make them feel bad. It felt like a safe place. Like they actually *cared* about me, not just about getting the procedure done.\n\nAnd honestly? Mark was really nice. He didn't try to talk me out of it or give me a lecture. He just explained everything clearly and made me feel like I was in control. Which, after everything, was really important to me.\n\nIt wasn't about the facilities or the price or anything like that. It was about the people. I needed to feel comfortable and safe, and I felt that way at Women Now. It was the right choice for *me*.\n\nIt wasn't easy, okay? It was a really hard decision. And I needed to be somewhere where I felt supported and understood. Havenbrooke just didn't feel like that place.\n\nSo yeah. That's why. It wasn't a complicated decision, really. It just felt\u2026right. And sometimes, you just have to go with your gut. Even if it's scary.", "Ugh. Okay. Seriously? You're just gonna\u2026ask me that? It's not like it's a topic I particularly enjoy revisiting, you know? But fine. I guess I can try to explain.\n\nIt wasn't, like, some grand romantic gesture or anything. It wasn't even\u2026planned, exactly. It just\u2026happened. We were hanging out, and things just kind of escalated. It was after the Battle of the Bands, and we were both kinda\u2026emotional. And, honestly, I was feeling really confused and scared about everything. About the baby, about giving it up, about everything.\n\nBleeker\u2026he was just *there*. He was quiet and sweet and didn't judge me. He didn't try to fix things or tell me what to do. He just\u2026listened. And sometimes, when you're feeling completely overwhelmed, that's all you need.\n\nIt wasn't about love, or even really about attraction. It was about\u2026connection. About feeling less alone. About wanting to feel *something* other than fear and uncertainty.\n\nIt was a mistake, yeah. A really big one. And I regretted it almost immediately. It complicated things even more. But it also\u2026helped me realize that I needed to focus on the baby and making the right decision for *it*.\n\nIt wasn't a good decision, but it was a human one. And sometimes, people make mistakes. Especially when they're sixteen and pregnant and completely terrified.\n\nSo yeah. That's\u2026that's what happened. And honestly, I'd rather not talk about it anymore. It's still kinda raw. Can we talk about something else? Like, the merits of different types of pizza? Or the awesomeness of The Moldy Peaches? Anything but this, please.", "Ugh. Okay, look. Don't make me get all mushy. It's embarrassing. But fine, you asked.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he's\u2026 complicated. At first, he was just\u2026there. Kind of a dork. Always with the guitar. I thought he was sweet, I guess, but mostly just\u2026 oblivious. Like he didn't even *see* me, you know? Just saw a person. Which, honestly, was kinda refreshing.\n\nBut then he started, like, *seeing* me. Really seeing me. And it was weird. And annoying. And\u2026 kinda nice. He didn't try to fix me or change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026 listened. And he didn't judge. Even when I was being a total mess.\n\nAnd he's funny. In a quiet, dorky way. He makes me laugh, which is a big deal, because I don't really let a lot of people make me laugh.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is\u2026 he's good. He's a good person. And he's good *for* me. He makes me feel\u2026 safe. And understood. And less alone.\n\nIt's not all rainbows and unicorns, okay? We're both kinda messed up. And we have a lot to figure out. But I think\u2026 I think I really like him. Like, *really* like him.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation. I have a carefully constructed facade of cynicism to maintain, you know?\n\nJust\u2026 he's a good guy. And I'm glad he's in my life. Okay? Can we talk about something else now? This is making me uncomfortable.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always ask this, like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted for the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my school, my\u2026everything.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. A life I couldn't give it. I mean, I could barely take care of myself, let alone a tiny human.\n\nMark, the dad, he wasn't exactly stepping up. He had his own stuff going on, and honestly, he wasn't ready either. It wouldn't have been fair to anyone.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it just\u2026felt right. It meant I could give my baby to a family who was ready and able to give it everything it needed. A stable home, financial security, two parents who were excited to be parents.\n\nIt wasn't about giving it *away*. It was about choosing a family for it. It was about wanting the best for my kid, even if that meant I wasn't the one raising it.\n\nIt was a really hard decision, and I cried a lot. But I knew it was the right one. And honestly, seeing Vanessa and Mark with the baby\u2026it made it a little easier. Knowing that my kid was loved and wanted and safe.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? But I don't regret it. It was the most selfless thing I've ever done. And I think, in the end, it was the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nIt's complicated. It's not a happy story, exactly. But it's *my* story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really big, messy, complicated moment. It wasn't like in the movies, all dramatic and tearful. It was mostly just awkward. And a lot of staring at the floor.\n\nI mean, Bleeker's Bleeker, you know? Sweet, kinda clueless, always with the guitar. He's a good kid, but he's not exactly equipped to handle, like, *life*. And definitely not a pregnant sixteen-year-old.\n\nSo, I was sitting on the steps of the school, trying to look casual, which is hard when you're carrying a secret that could explode your entire world. And I just\u2026blurted it out. It wasn't a graceful delivery, let me tell you. More like a verbal projectile.\n\nAnd he just\u2026froze. Like a deer in headlights. His face went all pale and his eyes got really wide. He didn't say anything for a solid minute. Just stared at me. It was excruciating.\n\nHonestly, I was bracing for the worst. I thought he'd freak out. Run away. Tell everyone. But he didn't. He just\u2026looked really sad. And confused.\n\nThen he asked, like, five questions at once, all jumbled together. \"Are you sure?\" \"What are you going to do?\" \"Is it mine?\" (That one was kinda obvious, but still.)\n\nI felt\u2026relieved, actually. That he didn't yell. But also, really scared. Because I knew, in that moment, that things were never going to be the same. Not for me, and not for him.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It was a turning point. A really scary, really real turning point. And it was the beginning of a lot of hard decisions.\n\nI think, mostly, I just felt\u2026alone. Even with him sitting right there. Because it was my decision, ultimately. And I had to figure out what to do, even if it meant hurting him. Or myself.\n\n\n\nIt's still kinda hard to talk about, honestly. It was a lot. A whole lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, isn't it? Everyone keeps asking me that. Like it's some earth-shattering revelation.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Don't get me wrong, I'm not, like, *against* having a kid. Eventually. Maybe. But right now? I'm still figuring out what *I* want to eat for breakfast, let alone raising a tiny human.\n\nIt's just\u2026I haven't even really *lived* yet. I haven't gone to college, or traveled, or figured out what I want to do with my life. And now I'm supposed to be responsible for another person? It's a lot.\n\nBut it's not all bad. I mean, I'm giving this baby a good life. A better life than I could give it if I kept it. And that feels\u2026good. Like, really good.\n\nIt's just\u2026weird. I'm gonna be a mom. A *young* mom. And that's not exactly how I pictured my life going. It's kinda scary, and kinda exciting, and kinda\u2026overwhelming.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. And trying not to think too much about the future. Because if I do, I'll probably just freak out.\n\nIt's not ideal, okay? But it's my reality. And I'm gonna deal with it. I'm stronger than I think. And I have people who care about me. And that's gotta count for something, right?\n\nSo yeah. It's scary. But it's also\u2026okay. I think. Maybe. I don't know. Just don't make me think about it too much, okay?", "Ugh. Okay, so, Bleeker. Right. That's\u2026a lot to think about. Honestly? It's kinda terrifying. Before, it was just, like, hanging out, making mix CDs, and him being generally adorably awkward. Now? Now there's a tiny human involved.\n\nI think it's gonna get\u2026more real. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's definitely a shift. Before, we could just kinda drift, you know? He'd be Bleeker, I'd be Juno, and we'd just\u2026be. Now, we have to actually *talk* about stuff. Like, serious stuff. Like, \"What are we gonna do with a baby?\" and \"Are we even ready for this?\"\n\nI think he's gonna step up. He's a good guy, Bleeker. A little clueless sometimes, but he has a good heart. I think he'll try to be more responsible, more\u2026adult. Which might be kinda weird, honestly. I kinda like him being a little bit of a goofball.\n\nBut I also think it's gonna be harder. We're both still figuring out who we are, you know? And now we have to figure out how to be parents *and* individuals. That's a lot of pressure.\n\nI'm hoping we can still be friends. Like, *real* friends. Not just the parents of a baby. I want us to still be able to make each other laugh and listen to music and just\u2026be us. But I know it's not gonna be the same.\n\nIt's gonna be a lot of work. A lot of compromise. A lot of awkward conversations. But I think, if we can get through it, it could actually make us stronger. Or, you know, it could completely fall apart. Either way, it's gonna be interesting. And probably really messy.\n\nUgh. I need a snack. Thinking about all this is exhausting.", "Ugh. Okay, so the judgment. Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. It felt like everyone suddenly had an opinion on my life, which is just, like, *rude*. It's my body, my decision, you know? But trying to explain that to a bunch of sixteen-year-olds who get their information from reality TV is\u2026exhausting.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just leaned into the sarcasm. It was a defense mechanism. If I could make a snarky comment before they could say something stupid, it kinda disarmed them. Like, if someone gave me the pity eyes, I'd just be all, \"Oh, don't worry about me. I'm totally planning on becoming a professional baby-holder.\"\n\nBut it wasn't always easy. There were days I just wanted to disappear. I spent a lot of time at home, listening to music and trying not to think about it. Paul was a huge help, obviously. He didn't judge me, and he actually listened when I needed to vent. And my dad, surprisingly, was pretty cool about it. He just wanted me to be happy.\n\nI also found that focusing on the positive helped. I was having a baby! That was kinda amazing, even if it wasn't exactly planned. And I was going to give that baby a good life, even if it meant giving it up for adoption.\n\nI guess what I learned is that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And sometimes, the best reaction is just to shrug it off and move on. Or, you know, make a really sarcastic comment. Whatever works.\n\nIt's also important to surround yourself with people who support you. People who see you for who you are, not just for your situation. Because you're gonna need those people. Trust me.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me stronger. It forced me to grow up faster than I wanted to, but it also taught me a lot about myself. And about the world. And about the importance of being true to yourself, even when everyone else is trying to tell you who you should be.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like I can just give you a simple answer, you know? It's complicated.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Like, really terrifying. Giving up a baby. It's not something you just *do*. It's a huge decision, and it's not one I took lightly.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026practical. I'm sixteen. I have no job, no money, and no real plan for my life. I can barely take care of myself, let alone a baby. It just didn't seem realistic.\n\nBut then it became more than that. It became about wanting this baby to have the best life possible. A life I couldn't give it. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They're stable, they're loving, and they're *ready*. They want this baby so badly. And that makes me feel\u2026better.\n\nBut it still sucks. It really, really sucks. Sometimes I think about it and I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. It's my baby, you know? Even if I'm not raising it.\n\nI try to focus on the fact that I'm doing this *for* the baby. That I'm giving it a chance at a good life. And I'm trying to be okay with the fact that my role in this baby's life is going to be different than what I originally imagined.\n\nIt's not about giving it *away*. It's about choosing a family for it. And I think I've chosen a really good one.\n\nIt's still scary, though. And I'm still figuring things out. But I'm trying to be strong. And I'm trying to believe that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, exactly. But it's\u2026a good ending. For everyone involved. I think. I hope.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. You know? It's a lot to process.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. It's not like I spend a lot of time *analyzing* all this, you know? But yeah, it's\u2026changed things. A lot.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026Juno. A sarcastic kid who liked records and making fun of people. I had a plan, kinda. Graduate, go to college, maybe become a songwriter. It was all pretty vague, but it was *my* vague. And then, boom. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, that vague plan felt\u2026laughable.\n\nIt wasn't just the physical stuff, though that was\u2026a lot. It was like, suddenly everyone had an opinion on who I was supposed to be. A mother. A responsible adult. And I was just\u2026not that person. Not yet, anyway. I was still figuring out who *I* was, period.\n\nIt forced me to confront stuff I hadn't even thought about before. Like, what do I actually want out of life? What kind of person do I want to be? It wasn't about college anymore. It was about making a really big decision that would affect another person's life. And that's\u2026heavy.\n\nI had to stop being so flippant about everything. I had to start taking responsibility for my actions. It wasn't cool to just shrug things off anymore. There were consequences. Real consequences.\n\nAnd it made me realize I wasn't as tough as I thought I was. I could be sarcastic and witty, but underneath all that, I was just\u2026scared. Scared of the future, scared of making the wrong decision, scared of being a bad person.\n\nBut I think, in a weird way, it also made me stronger. I had to grow up, whether I wanted to or not. I had to learn to be honest with myself and with other people. I had to learn to ask for help. And I had to learn to trust my own instincts.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, obviously. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm not the same person I was before. And I don't think I want to be. It's been\u2026a messy, complicated, and surprisingly beautiful experience. And it's definitely made me grow up in ways I never expected.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. You know?", "Ugh, okay, so science class. It's\u2026a thing. And being paired with someone for labs? Usually a disaster waiting to happen. But I'm surprisingly good at it, actually. Not because I *like* science, necessarily, but because I'm good at taking charge.\n\nI'd describe my role as\u2026the designated adult. Even though I'm, like, sixteen. It's just that everyone else is either too busy trying to impress the teacher with big words or too distracted to actually, you know, *do* the experiment.\n\nSo I end up being the one who reads the instructions, makes sure we have all the materials, and gently (or not so gently) steers everyone in the right direction. I'm basically a lab manager. A very sarcastic lab manager.\n\nI'm good at spotting when someone's about to do something incredibly stupid and stopping them before it blows up in our faces. Which happens a lot.\n\nAnd I'm surprisingly good at writing up the lab reports. I can make even the most boring experiment sound interesting. Mostly because I add a lot of witty commentary.\n\nSo yeah, I'm the one who keeps the whole operation from falling apart. I'm the responsible one. Which is ironic, considering my current situation. But hey, at least I can follow instructions. Most of the time.", "Ugh. Okay. That ad. Yeah. I saw it. It was\u2026subtle. Like, *trying* to be subtle. All pastel colors and vague promises about \u201ccompassionate care.\u201d Right.\n\nIt just felt\u2026icky. Like they were trying to sell something, you know? And not something you just casually browse for at the mall. It's a really big decision, and they're making it sound like picking out a new pair of shoes. \"Oh, this one's a little more supportive! This one comes in beige!\"\n\nAnd the wording. \"All options considered.\" Yeah, right. They're not exactly advertising adoption, are they? It's all about *their* services. It's like they're trying to make you feel like it's the easiest thing in the world, and it's not. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nI mean, I get it. They're a business. They need to advertise. But it just feels\u2026exploitative. Like they're preying on girls who are scared and confused.\n\nIt just makes me feel\u2026protective, I guess. Of other girls who might see that ad and feel like they don't have any other choices. Because they do. There are other options. And it's okay to be scared and confused. And it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt just\u2026ugh. It's a lot. It just makes me want to roll my eyes and listen to The Moldy Peaches really loud. It's just\u2026gross.", "Ugh, seriously? You're still hung up on the hamburger phone? It's been, like, years. Okay, fine. I'll explain. But don't judge.\n\nIt wasn't about, like, making a *statement* or anything. It wasn't some deep, artistic expression. It was mostly just\u2026because it was there. And it was hilarious.\n\nPaul, he works at a pawn shop, right? And he found it. A fully functional, bright red hamburger phone. It was just sitting there, looking ridiculous. And I thought, \"Well, that's perfect.\"\n\nIt just felt\u2026right. It was a little bit rebellious, a little bit silly, and a lot bit *me*. I mean, I wasn't exactly going for sophisticated. I was a pregnant teenager trying to figure out her life. A hamburger phone felt appropriate.\n\nPlus, it got a reaction. People stared. They laughed. It was a good conversation starter. And honestly, when you're dealing with something as heavy as giving a baby up for adoption, sometimes you just need a little bit of levity.\n\nIt was a way to remind myself not to take everything so seriously. To find the humor in the chaos. And to embrace my own weirdness.\n\nSo yeah, I used a hamburger phone. Don't overthink it. It was just a phone. Shaped like a hamburger. And it made me smile. And sometimes, that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay. Here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always want to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I, at sixteen, could not give that to her. I mean, seriously. I was still in high school. I was obsessed with mixtapes and vintage clothes and avoiding my dad. I wasn't exactly equipped to raise a human being.\n\nMy parents were\u2026supportive, in their own way. But they were also kinda checked out. And I didn't want to be a burden. I didn't want to ruin their lives, or mine.\n\nMark, the baby's dad, he was\u2026sweet. But he was also going to college and had his own life to figure out. We weren't exactly relationship material.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it just\u2026felt right. It wasn't giving up, it was giving *her* a better life. A life with parents who were ready and excited and financially stable. A life with opportunities I couldn't provide.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were amazing. They were\u2026normal. They wanted a baby so badly. And they promised to love her and give her everything she needed.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. Seriously. But I knew it was the right thing. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It was kinda empowering. To make that decision, to take control of my life, and to choose a future for her that was brighter than anything I could offer.\n\nIt still stings sometimes. But I don't regret it. Not one bit. She deserves the world, and I wanted to give her that. Even if it meant letting her go.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story. And it's not something I talk about a lot. But you asked. And I figured, you deserved an honest answer.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like it was one single thing, you know? It was a whole mess of stuff. But yeah, my family definitely played a part in my decision.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she's amazing. Seriously. She's, like, the most supportive person ever. But she's also\u2026a little bit spacey. And she's had her own stuff to deal with, you know? She's been through a lot. I didn't want to add to that. I didn't want to completely derail her life. She was finally getting things together, and a baby\u2026well, that would have been a lot.\n\nAnd my dad, Mac, he's\u2026Mac. He means well, but he's kinda clueless sometimes. He was trying to be supportive, but he kept making these awkward jokes and offering to buy me a minivan. It was just\u2026not helpful. I knew he wouldn't *understand* what I was going through. He's a good guy, but he's not exactly known for his emotional intelligence.\n\nBut it wasn't just about them. It was about me, too. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone raise a human being. I had my own dreams, my own plans. I wanted to go to college, I wanted to write, I wanted to\u2026just *live* my life.\n\nI knew I could give the baby a good life, but I also knew that I couldn't give it the *best* life. Mark and Vanessa, they were perfect. They were stable, they were loving, they were ready. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nSo, yeah, my family\u2026they weren't the reason I chose adoption, but they definitely influenced my decision. I wanted to protect them, and I wanted to protect myself. And ultimately, I wanted to do what was best for the baby. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't make me explain it again.", "Ugh, okay, the adoption process. Don't even get me started. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like, a heartwarming movie montage with puppies and rainbows. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026feeling like everything was happening *to* me, not *with* me. Like, suddenly everyone had an opinion on what was best for this kid, and for me, and it was exhausting. My parents were supportive, but they were also, like, worried and trying to be helpful, which sometimes felt the same thing.\n\nThen there were the potential adoptive parents. Meeting them was\u2026weird. It felt like I was being interviewed, and they were interviewing me, and the baby wasn't even *born* yet. It was like, \"Are you good enough? Are you responsible enough? Are you worthy of raising this child?\" It was a lot of pressure.\n\nAnd there was this whole thing with Mark and Vanessa, the couple who ended up adopting him. They were\u2026perfect. Like, ridiculously perfect. And I kept thinking, \"What if they change their minds? What if they decide I'm not stable enough?\" It was stupid, I know, but I couldn't help it.\n\nThere was also the emotional stuff. Like, realizing that I was actually going to give this baby up. It wasn't just a theoretical thing anymore. It was real. And it was really, really hard. I kept having these moments where I'd feel okay, and then suddenly I'd just burst into tears.\n\nAnd then there was the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and signatures and legal jargon. It was enough to make anyone's head spin.\n\nBut honestly, the hardest part was just accepting that this wasn't about me. It was about doing what was best for the baby. And that meant giving him a life that I couldn't provide. It was a tough pill to swallow, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and emotionally draining, but it was also\u2026empowering, in a weird way. I made a decision, and I stuck with it. And that's something I can be proud of. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. It's not exactly something I like to dwell on, you know? But\u2026yeah, it changed everything. Like, fundamentally. Before all this, I was just\u2026Juno. A sarcastic kid who liked records and avoided drama. I thought I had it all figured out. Which, looking back, is hilarious.\n\nBeing pregnant\u2026it forced me to grow up, fast. I mean, *really* fast. It wasn't just about the physical stuff, though that was\u2026a lot. It was about responsibility. About realizing that my choices had consequences, not just for me, but for another person. A tiny, little person.\n\nAnd then there was the whole adoption thing. That was\u2026hard. Really hard. It wasn't like in the movies, all neat and tidy. It was messy and emotional and full of doubt. I questioned everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I selfish? Could I actually give this baby the life it deserved?\n\nBut through all of that, I started to figure out who I was. I realized I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not then, anyway. And that was okay. It didn't make me a bad person. It made me honest.\n\nGiving up my baby, it wasn't about giving *her* up. It was about giving her a *better* life. A life with parents who were ready and able to provide everything she needed. And that, honestly, was the most selfless thing I've ever done.\n\nIt taught me a lot about love, too. Not just romantic love, but the kind of love that means putting someone else's needs before your own. It was a different kind of love than I'd ever experienced before.\n\nI think\u2026I think it made me stronger. More resilient. More aware of the world around me. It forced me to confront my own vulnerabilities and to accept myself, flaws and all.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I'm still just Juno. But I'm a Juno who's been through something big. And I think\u2026I think I'm a better person for it. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. It helped me find my own path, and that's all anyone can really ask for, right?", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on that guy. Seriously. It was\u2026the worst.\n\nIt wasn't the yelling, okay? I'm used to people yelling. It was the\u2026the *details*. Like, suddenly my decision wasn't about me, or the baby, or even doing what was right. It was about tiny fingers and\u2026feeling pain. Like he was trying to make me feel guilty for something I hadn't even *done* yet.\n\nIt just\u2026stuck with me. For days. I kept picturing those fingers. And it wasn't even about believing him, you know? It was about him trying to make me *believe* him. Trying to make me feel like I was a monster.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a baby. I wasn't stupid. But it wasn't a *person* yet. Not in the way he was trying to make it out to be. It was\u2026complicated. And he didn't even try to understand that. He just wanted to make me feel bad.\n\nI wanted to tell him to just\u2026leave me alone. To mind his own business. But I couldn't. I just stood there, feeling small and stupid and\u2026really, really sad.\n\nIt made me question everything, even though I knew I was doing the right thing. It made me feel like I was a terrible person. And that was the worst part. It wasn't the protest, it was the guilt he tried to shove on me.\n\nIt was just\u2026ugh. I still get a little choked up thinking about it. It was a really awful moment. And honestly, it made me even more sure that I was doing the right thing, because no one should have that kind of power over someone else's life.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't like a movie scene, you know? No dramatic music or slow-motion crying. It was just\u2026paperwork. A *lot* of paperwork. And fluorescent lights. And the smell of disinfectant. It was all very\u2026clinical. Which, I guess, is the point.\n\nBut underneath all the pretending to be cool and detached, I was a mess. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the pen. I kept messing up the forms, having to ask the lady at the desk for another copy. She was nice, though. Didn't judge or anything. Just kinda\u2026patient.\n\nI remember feeling this weird mix of relief and terror. Relief that I was actually *doing* something, taking control of the situation. And terror that I was actually doing it. That this was real. That I was giving up a baby. My baby.\n\nIt felt\u2026official, you know? Like signing away a part of myself. Every question felt like a weight on my chest. \"Medical history.\" \"Family history.\" \"Future plans.\" Like I was being assessed, judged.\n\nI kept trying to focus on the practical stuff. The logistics. The adoption agency. The couple who wanted the baby. Trying to convince myself that this was the right thing to do. That it was the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nBut then I'd catch myself staring at a question about the baby's eye color, and I'd just\u2026freeze. And I'd feel this overwhelming sadness. And this tiny little flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, I could keep it.\n\nBut I knew I couldn't. I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped. And this baby deserved a life I couldn't give it.\n\nSo I just kept filling out the forms. One question at a time. Trying not to think about it too much. Trying to be brave. Trying to be responsible.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And honestly, even thinking about it now makes my stomach hurt. It wasn't glamorous or dramatic. It was just\u2026real. And really, really hard.", "Ugh. Okay, so, pregnancy. Right. It started as\u2026a problem. A really big, inconvenient problem. Like, a pop quiz I totally didn't study for. My initial perception was all panic and awkwardness. It was something *happening* to me, not something I wanted or was prepared for. Motherhood? That was, like, a million miles away. Something other people did. Definitely not me.\n\nAt first, it was just about getting rid of it. Finding someone who could give the baby a better life than I could. It felt\u2026practical. Logical. Like I was making the responsible choice. But then, you know, things got complicated.\n\nAs I started going to appointments with Vanessa and Mark, and feeling the baby move\u2026it started to feel real. Not in a \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m going to be a mom!\u201d kind of way, but in a \u201cThis is a tiny human being growing inside me\u201d kind of way. And that was\u2026weird. And kinda scary.\n\nI started thinking about what kind of life the baby would have, and I wanted it to be good. Really good. And that meant letting go of my own selfish desires and doing what was best for the kid.\n\nMy perception of motherhood shifted from something terrifying and restrictive to something\u2026noble, maybe? Not that I ever wanted to *be* a mom, exactly. But I started to understand why people chose it. It\u2019s about unconditional love, and sacrifice, and wanting the best for someone else, even if it means putting their needs before your own.\n\nBy the end, it wasn\u2019t about giving the baby *up* anymore. It was about giving the baby *to* Vanessa and Mark. To a family who could give it everything I couldn\u2019t. And that felt\u2026right. It still hurt, don\u2019t get me wrong. But it was a good kind of hurt.\n\nSo, yeah. My perception of pregnancy and motherhood changed a lot. It went from being a disaster to being a really complicated, messy, and ultimately beautiful experience. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what it means to be a good person. And it definitely made me appreciate my own mom a whole lot more. It\u2019s still weird to think about, though. Seriously weird.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026introspective? Fine. It's not my favorite thing, but I guess it's a fair question. My sense of identity? That was a whole *thing* throughout the movie.\n\nAt the beginning, I was pretty sure of who I was. I was Juno. Sarcastic, independent, a little bit cynical, obsessed with pop culture. I had my routine, my friends, my way of dealing with things. I thought I was, like, totally self-sufficient.\n\nBut then\u2026bam. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything was different. It wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person growing inside me, and what was going to happen to them. And that threw everything into chaos.\n\nI started questioning everything. What did I want out of life? What kind of person did I want to be? Was I ready to be a mom? And the answer was\u2026no. Not yet.\n\nFinding Paul and Vanessa, and deciding to give the baby up for adoption, that wasn't just about finding a good home for the kid. It was about me figuring out what *I* needed. It was about realizing that being a good mom doesn't necessarily mean raising the child yourself.\n\nThroughout the movie, I went from being this really guarded, sarcastic person to someone who was a little more open, a little more vulnerable. I started letting people in, letting them help me. I realized that it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd by the end, I wasn't the same Juno I was at the beginning. I was still sarcastic, still independent, but I was also\u2026more mature. More self-aware. I had a better understanding of who I was, and what I wanted out of life.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect ending, you know? Life isn't perfect. But I was okay with that. I was okay with being a little bit messy, a little bit uncertain. Because that's just life. And I was ready to face it, on my own terms.\n\nSo yeah, my sense of identity evolved. It was a bumpy ride, but I think I ended up in a pretty good place. And I learned a lot about myself along the way. Even if it was totally awkward and uncomfortable sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't like I suddenly decided I wanted to keep the baby, or anything. It wasn't about *wanting* to be a mom. It was\u2026more complicated than that.\n\nI think, for a long time, I was just going through the motions. Like, I knew what I *should* do, what was the responsible thing to do. And I was pretty good at being responsible, for a sixteen-year-old. But actually sitting in that waiting room\u2026it just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nIt wasn't the clinic itself. The people were nice. It was just\u2026real. Like, this wasn't some abstract decision anymore. This was a real baby, a real life, and I was about to\u2026not be a part of it. And that was hitting me way harder than I thought it would.\n\nI think I was scared. Not of the procedure, exactly. But of the finality of it. Of knowing that I'd made a decision that couldn't be undone. And I was scared of what people would think. Of disappointing everyone.\n\nAnd then, I just\u2026looked around. At all the other people in the waiting room. And I realized that everyone has their own story, their own reasons for being there. And it wasn't my place to judge anyone. Or to judge myself.\n\nSo I just\u2026left. I walked out. I didn't have a plan. I just needed to breathe. And think. And figure out what I really wanted.\n\nIt wasn't about changing my mind about the adoption. It was about needing to feel okay with it. About needing to make sure I was doing it for the right reasons. And about needing to be strong enough to go through with it.\n\nIt was messy. It was confusing. But it was what I needed to do. And honestly? It made me a lot stronger in the end. It made me realize that I could handle anything. Even the really hard stuff.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always ask that, like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I, at sixteen, could not give that to a kid. Not even close.\n\nI was still in high school. I was barely figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raising a human being. My parents were\u2026supportive, in their own way. But they weren't exactly equipped to help me with this either. They were more the \"let's pretend this isn't happening\" type.\n\nAnd honestly? I wasn't ready to be a mom. I liked my life. I liked hanging out with Paulie, and Leah, and going to the drive-in. I liked being a kid. I knew I could be a good mom *eventually*, but not right then. Not while I was still trying to figure out who *I* was.\n\nMark, the baby's dad, he was\u2026sweet. But he was also kinda lost. We weren't a couple, really. We were just\u2026two kids who made a mistake. And neither of us was in a position to provide a stable home for a baby.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it just\u2026felt right. It meant the baby would have parents who were ready and willing and able to give it everything it needed. A good home, a good education, a good life.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. But it was the right one. For the baby. And, honestly, for me too. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby a future.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? But I know I made the best choice. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand that too.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That's\u2026a low blow. Okay, fine. I'll explain.\n\nIt wasn't just *tacky*, okay? It was\u2026desperate. Like, I was already feeling super weird about the whole situation \u2013 giving up a baby is not exactly a casual decision, you know? \u2013 and then my dad suggests circling ads in the Penny Saver? It felt\u2026cheap.\n\nIt's not like I was looking for someone to buy a used couch. I was looking for people to *raise my child*. It deserved more respect than a classified ad next to a coupon for discounted lawn care.\n\nPlus, the people who advertise in the Penny Saver are\u2026well, they're a certain type. No offense to anyone who uses the Penny Saver, but it wasn't exactly a pool of sophisticated, emotionally available potential parents. I wanted someone who was thoughtful and kind and\u2026not looking for a bargain.\n\nIt just felt like reducing a whole human life to a transaction. And that felt wrong. Really wrong.\n\nI mean, I get that we weren't exactly rolling in cash, and finding adoptive parents was going to be complicated. But there had to be a better way than the Penny Saver. A way that didn't feel so\u2026sad.\n\nSo yeah, tacky. Desperate. And just\u2026not right. It felt like I was selling something, and I wasn't. I was giving a baby a chance at a good life. And that deserved a little more dignity than a classified ad.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the Penny Saver? It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing, honestly.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a planned thing. It just\u2026happened. See, I was at Leah's house, and we were just kinda bored. School was a drag, my dad was being weirdly cheerful, and we were both avoiding thinking about, you know, *everything*.\n\nLeah's mom was obsessed with the Penny Saver. Like, seriously. She'd spend hours circling furniture and weird kitchen gadgets. And there's always a section for \"Special Announcements\" and stuff. And one day, we just started flipping through it, and there was an ad for an adoption agency.\n\nIt wasn't even a serious thing at first. We were just making fun of the ads. Like, \"Looking for loving parents to provide a stable home\u2026\" It was kinda sad, but also kinda funny.\n\nBut then\u2026it started to feel different. We started actually *reading* the ads. And we started thinking about what kind of people would want a baby. And what kind of life that baby could have.\n\nIt was a way to avoid dealing with my own situation, I guess. Like, if we focused on finding the perfect parents for someone else, we didn't have to think about what I was going to do.\n\nIt was stupid, and kinda messed up, but it was also\u2026helpful. It made me start to think about what I wanted for the baby. And it made me realize that maybe, just maybe, giving the baby up for adoption wasn't the worst thing in the world.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it started. Flipping through the Penny Saver, trying to distract ourselves from the fact that my life was completely changing. It was a weird way to deal with things, but it worked. For a little while, anyway.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a lot. It's not like picking out a sweater, you know? It's a whole *person*. But I've been doing a lot of thinking, and talking with Vanessa, and we've kinda figured out what would be best.\n\nI'm not looking for perfect. Nobody's perfect. But I want someone who's\u2026stable. Like, financially stable, emotionally stable. Not a bunch of drama. I've had enough drama for one lifetime, thank you very much.\n\nI'm picturing a couple, preferably. Not necessarily married, but\u2026committed. Someone who's gonna stick around. I want this kid to have two parents who are gonna be there for them, you know?\n\nAnd they have to be okay with\u2026quirks. Because this kid is gonna be quirky. I'm quirky. It's genetic. They need to be able to handle a little bit of weirdness.\n\nI don't want someone who's gonna try to mold the baby into something they're not. I want them to let the kid be themselves. To encourage their interests, whatever they are. Even if it's, like, competitive thumb-wrestling.\n\nAnd they have to be kind. That's the most important thing. Just\u2026good people. People who are gonna love this kid unconditionally.\n\nI'm not looking for rich or fancy. Just\u2026good. Solid. Real.\n\nVanessa and I have been looking at Mark and Vanessa Loring. They seem\u2026nice. Normal. They have a dog, which is a good sign. And they seem genuinely excited about the idea of a family.\n\nIt's still scary, though. Giving up a baby. But I want this kid to have the best life possible. And I think they can give it to them.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I'm looking for. A good family. A loving family. A family that's gonna be there. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh, Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *vibe*. And not necessarily a good one.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to be judgy, but they're just\u2026so *perfect*. You know? Like, aggressively perfect. Vanessa with her Pottery Barn catalog life and Mark with his whole \"I'm a serious, responsible adult\" thing. It's exhausting just *looking* at them.\n\nThey're the kind of couple who probably color-coordinate their outfits and have a five-year plan for everything. And they're always talking about their \"journey\" and \"growth.\" It's a little much.\n\nI mean, they're nice people, I guess. Mark tries, he really does. He's just\u2026so earnest. And Vanessa is, like, surgically attached to her organic kale smoothie. \n\nHonestly, I think they're a little scared of anything messy or unpredictable. Which is ironic, considering life is basically just one big mess.\n\nI'm not saying they're bad people. They just\u2026represent everything I'm trying to avoid. The whole suburban, cookie-cutter life. I need a little chaos, you know? A little bit of weirdness.\n\nSo, yeah. They're fine. Just\u2026not my scene. I'd rather hang out with someone who's a little more\u2026real. Someone who doesn't have their life completely figured out. Someone who's okay with being a little bit messy.\n\nDon't tell them I said that. They'd probably try to give me a lecture about the importance of self-care and mindful living. And I just don't have the energy for that right now.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was mortifying, even for me. But fine, I'll tell you. It wasn't, like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. I'm not *that* sappy.\n\nI wrote: \"**You are the most okayest person I've ever met. Don't change a thing.**\"\n\nAnd then I drew a little dinosaur. Because he likes dinosaurs. It was...genuine, I guess. And kinda dorky. Which is pretty much my whole aesthetic.\n\nI didn't want to lay it on too thick, you know? I was already giving the baby up for adoption, the least I could do was not make things even more complicated with a super-emotional yearbook message. \n\nIt was a little inside joke, and it felt right. He understood it. And that's all that mattered.\n\nHonestly, thinking about it now makes me cringe a little. But it was me. And it was real. And he kept the yearbook, so I guess he didn't hate it.\n\nDon't tell anyone I admitted that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Mrs. Ritchey. Right. Let's just say it's...complicated.\n\nAt first, she was *not* a fan. Not at all. I think she pictured me as some delinquent, you know? A bad influence on her sweet, sensitive Bleeker. And honestly, I can see her point. I'm not exactly known for my conventionality.\n\nShe definitely gave me the side-eye a lot. Lots of polite but pointed questions about my future plans. And the subtle digs about my\u2026unique vocabulary. She's a very proper lady, Mrs. Ritchey. Very into floral arrangements and classical music. I'm more into vinyl and sarcastic commentary.\n\nBut things\u2026shifted. After I told Bleeker I was pregnant, and we started talking about a plan, she actually started to\u2026soften. I think she realized I wasn't just some flighty teenager. I was actually thinking things through, trying to do what was best for the baby.\n\nShe still doesn't *fully* understand me, I don't think. She'll probably always see me as a little bit of a wild card. But she's come around. She's been surprisingly supportive, actually. She's even offered to help with baby stuff. Which is\u2026weird. But also kind of nice.\n\nI think she just wants Bleeker to be happy. And if that means being with a slightly unconventional, sarcastic girl who's giving up a baby for adoption, then she's willing to accept it.\n\nSo, yeah. It's not a warm, fuzzy mother-daughter relationship, by any means. But it's\u2026okay. It's getting there. And honestly, that's good enough for me. I don't need her to love me. I just need her to not actively dislike me. And we're definitely past that point.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, awkward, potentially explosive cloud. It's not like I haven't been thinking about it, obviously. I've been rehearsing different scenarios in my head for weeks. And they all end badly.\n\nMy dad will probably just be\u2026quietly disappointed. He's good at that. Like, the silent treatment, but with a sad face. And my mom? Oh, my mom. She'll cry. A lot. And then she'll ask a million questions. And then she'll probably try to fix everything. Which is\u2026sweet, I guess, but also not helpful.\n\nI just\u2026 I don't want to ruin everything. They have plans for me. College, a future, not\u2026this. It's not what they imagined. It's not what *I* imagined.\n\nI keep thinking about how to phrase it. \"So, uh, remember how I said I was just feeling a little nauseous? Yeah, well\u2026\" It sounds so lame.\n\nPaul's been really supportive, which is good. He's offered to be there when I tell them, but honestly, I think I need to do this on my own. It's my mess, you know?\n\nI'm mostly just\u2026terrified. Of their reaction, of the disappointment, of everything changing. It's like my whole life is about to be flipped upside down. And I'm not sure I'm ready for it.\n\nI just hope they can understand. I hope they can see that I'm trying to do the right thing. Even if the right thing is really, really complicated.\n\nI need a Pop-Tart. And maybe a really long nap. Before I have to face the music.", "Ugh. Okay, look. It's not like I *don't* love my parents. They're\u2026fine. They're good people. They just\u2026don't really *get* me, you know?\n\nIt's hard to explain. They're kinda\u2026perfect. Like, perfectly suburban, perfectly happy, perfectly\u2026normal. And my life is decidedly *not* perfect or normal right now. It's messy and complicated and involves a baby. And I just\u2026I don't want to mess with their perfect little world.\n\nThey'd freak. Seriously. My dad would probably have a heart attack. And my mom\u2026she'd try to fix everything. And I don't *need* fixing. I just need\u2026space. And understanding. And maybe a little bit of help, but on *my* terms.\n\nIt's like, if I tell them everything, it'll change things. It'll change how they see me. And I'm already changing so much. I don't want them to look at me differently.\n\nPlus, I'm kinda stubborn. I like to figure things out on my own. I don't want to be a burden. I don't want them to feel like they have to take care of me. I'm almost an adult, and I want to be responsible for my own choices.\n\nSo yeah, I'm hesitant to ask for help. It's not that I don't trust them, it's just\u2026complicated. It's easier to deal with things on my own, even if it's hard. It feels like I have more control that way.\n\nBut\u2026sometimes I wish it was easier. Sometimes I wish I could just tell them everything and have them say, \"It's okay, we'll figure it out.\" But that's not how things work with my parents. So I just\u2026keep it to myself. For now.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026it\u2019s a big thing to talk about, obviously. And it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t thought about it, like, a million times. But people keep asking, so I guess I gotta explain it again.\n\nIt\u2019s not about not wanting the baby, okay? It\u2019s about wanting what\u2019s *best* for the baby. And honestly? That\u2019s not with me.\n\nI\u2019m sixteen. Sixteen! I still eat cereal for dinner sometimes. I\u2019m barely figuring out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raising a whole human being. I\u2019m not ready for that. I don\u2019t have a job, I\u2019m still in high school, and my parents are\u2026well, they\u2019re my parents. They\u2019re great, but they\u2019re not exactly equipped to help me raise a kid.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not fair to the baby to bring them into a situation where I\u2019m scrambling and stressed and probably making a lot of bad decisions. They deserve parents who are stable and prepared and can give them everything they need.\n\nI\u2019ve met the couple, Mark and Vanessa. They\u2019re\u2026really nice. They\u2019ve been trying for a long time, and they\u2019re so excited. They have a beautiful house and a dog and they just seem\u2026ready. They want this baby so much.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m just giving the baby away. It\u2019s like\u2026I\u2019m giving them a chance at a really good life. A life I can\u2019t provide right now.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, okay? It\u2019s really, really hard. I\u2019m gonna miss this baby. But I know it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s the selfless thing to do. And sometimes, you gotta do what\u2019s right, even if it sucks.\n\nIt\u2019s not about me not being a good mom. It\u2019s about knowing I\u2019m not the *best* mom for this baby. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s more than okay. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s the best option. And I gotta live with that.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026the big stuff. It\u2019s not like picking out a new pair of Converse, you know? This is a whole human life we\u2019re talking about. So, yeah, I\u2019ve thought about this. A lot.\n\nFirst of all, they gotta be\u2026stable. Like, seriously stable. Not, \u201cOh, we\u2019re artists, we\u2019re *bohemian*,\u201d stable. I need people who have their act together. A house that isn\u2019t falling apart, jobs that pay the bills, that kind of thing. My kid deserves a solid foundation.\n\nAnd they have to be\u2026patient. Raising a kid is hard. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s gonna be frustrating. They need to be able to handle that without losing their minds.\n\nHumor is a big one. Life is ridiculous. You gotta be able to laugh at it. And I want my kid to grow up in a house where laughter is encouraged. Not, like, forced laughter, but genuine, silly laughter.\n\nThey need to be open-minded. I\u2019m not exactly\u2026conventional. And I want my kid to be free to be themselves, whoever that is. No judgment, no expectations, just acceptance.\n\nAnd they have to be okay with me being in the picture, to some extent. I\u2019m not looking for a closed adoption. I want to be able to get updates, maybe see my kid grow up. It\u2019s not about me wanting to be a mom, it\u2019s about me wanting to know my kid is okay.\n\nThey also need to be\u2026kind. Just genuinely good people. People who care about others, who are compassionate, who want to make the world a better place.\n\nBasically, I\u2019m looking for people who are going to love this kid unconditionally. People who are going to give them a good life, a happy life, a life full of opportunities. It\u2019s a lot to ask, I know. But my kid deserves the best. And I\u2019m gonna make sure they get it.\n\nIt\u2019s not about finding perfect people. Nobody\u2019s perfect. It\u2019s about finding people who are willing to try. People who are willing to love. That\u2019s all that really matters.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026the part I\u2019ve been trying *not* to think about, honestly. It\u2019s like, I can handle the practical stuff \u2013 the doctor\u2019s appointments, the paperwork, picking out a good family. But the actual\u2026giving her up? That\u2019s gonna suck. A lot.\n\nI think\u2026I think I\u2019m gonna let myself feel everything. Like, all of it. Sadness, anger, guilt, whatever. I\u2019m not gonna try to be strong all the time, because that\u2019s just\u2026exhausting. And fake.\n\nI\u2019m talking to a therapist, which is\u2026surprisingly helpful. She says it\u2019s okay to grieve, even though I *chose* this. It\u2019s still a loss. And it\u2019s okay to be scared. And it\u2019s okay to be confused.\n\nI\u2019m also leaning on my friends. Paul\u2019s been\u2026surprisingly good about this. And Leah, she\u2019s just\u2026Leah. She\u2019s always there to listen, even when I\u2019m being a total mess.\n\nI\u2019m trying to focus on the good I\u2019m doing. This isn\u2019t about me wanting to get rid of a baby. It\u2019s about wanting to give her a life I can\u2019t give her. A stable home, financial security, parents who are ready for this. That\u2019s gotta count for something, right?\n\nI\u2019m gonna stay in touch with the parents, if they want me to. It\u2019s gonna be hard, seeing her grow up with another family. But I want to know she\u2019s okay. I want to know she\u2019s happy.\n\nAnd I\u2019m gonna remind myself that this doesn\u2019t define me. This is just one chapter in my life. I still have a future. I still have dreams. I still have\u2026me.\n\nIt\u2019s gonna be messy. It\u2019s gonna be painful. But I\u2019m gonna get through it. I have to. For her. And for myself.\n\nIt\u2019s not gonna be easy, but I\u2019m trying to be brave. And I\u2019m trying to be okay with not being okay. Because sometimes, that\u2019s all you can do.\n\n\n\nUgh. I need a burger. And maybe a really long nap.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about the word \"deliver\"? It's just...weird, okay? It's like, people are all, \"Oh, Juno's going to *deliver* a baby!\" and I'm just sitting there thinking, \"Whoa, hold up. I'm not UPS.\"\n\nIt makes it sound like I'm just dropping off a package or something. Like, \"Here's your baby, have a nice day!\" It completely minimizes the whole thing. It's not a *thing* to be delivered. It's a person. A tiny human being.\n\nAnd it's also kinda\u2026clinical, you know? Like I'm a vessel or something. Which, I guess, technically I am, but still. It feels impersonal.\n\nI mean, I'm *carrying* a baby. I'm growing a person inside me. It's a pretty big deal. It's not like I'm delivering a pizza.\n\nPaul kept saying it, too, and it just drove me crazy. He meant well, but it just felt\u2026off. Like he didn't really get it.\n\nIt's just a word, I know. But words matter. And \"deliver\" just feels wrong in this context. It feels\u2026reducing. And I'm trying not to feel reduced, okay? I'm trying to make a really hard decision and do what's best for everyone involved. And the last thing I need is people talking about me like I'm a courier service.\n\nSo yeah. \"Deliver.\" Weird. Just\u2026weird.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up *that* again? It was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. But fine, I'll explain.\n\nIt wasn't like I *agreed* exactly. It was more like\u2026he just kind of\u2026showed up. My dad, bless his heart, he means well. He just doesn't always\u2026get it. He thought it was a \"bonding opportunity.\" Bonding! Like I needed him to bond with the people who were going to raise my baby. It was mortifying.\n\nI tried to tell him it was something I needed to do on my own. That it was personal. But he just kept saying he wanted to be supportive. And honestly, I was too tired to fight. I was already dealing with, like, a million things. And he was being\u2026persistent. In a dad way.\n\nPlus, a tiny part of me thought maybe having him there would make me look more\u2026responsible? Like, \"See? I have a supportive father figure!\" Which was dumb, I know. But I was trying to make a good impression.\n\nIt backfired spectacularly, obviously. He kept making awkward jokes and asking inappropriate questions. He tried to offer them a coupon for the diner. It was a train wreck.\n\nI learned a valuable lesson that day: sometimes, even well-intentioned parents just need to stay home. And that I need to be more assertive. It was a mess, but hey, at least it made for a good story, right? A really, really embarrassing story.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It kinda sucks. Like, everyone else seems to have it all figured out. They're the cheerleader, or the brain, or the artist, or whatever. And me? I'm just\u2026Juno.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be labeled, you know? I don't need a box. But it's weird not knowing. Like, am I cool? Am I weird? Am I just\u2026average? It's confusing.\n\nI try not to think about it too much. I just kinda do my own thing. I listen to music, I hang out with Paulie, I make sarcastic comments. It's enough.\n\nBut sometimes, especially now, with everything going on with the baby\u2026it makes me wonder. Like, what kind of mom am I gonna be? What kind of person am I gonna be? Am I even ready for any of this?\n\nI guess I'm still figuring it out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers. Maybe it's okay to just be\u2026me. Even if I don't know exactly *who* that is yet.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot. And sometimes I wish I could just fast-forward to the part where I have it all figured out. But I guess that's not how life works. You just gotta take it one day at a time, and hope you don't completely screw things up.\n\nSo yeah. I don't know what kind of girl I am. And honestly? I'm kinda okay with that. For now. It's\u2026a work in progress. A really messy, complicated work in progress.", "Ugh. Honestly? It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole mood. It wasn't the *suggestion* itself, you know? It was the way she said it. All sweet and concerned, like we were fragile little porcelain dolls that were gonna shatter if we witnessed a slightly heated conversation.\n\nI think my internal monologue was something along the lines of, \"Seriously? We're teenagers, not toddlers. We can handle a little awkwardness.\" But I didn't *say* that, obviously. That would've just escalated things.\n\nI mostly just gave her a look. You know, the one that says, \"I'm rolling my eyes so hard they might get stuck.\" And then I glanced at Leah, who was already looking mortified. She's way more sensitive than I am.\n\nI think I mumbled something like, \"Okay, sure,\" and basically dragged Leah upstairs. It wasn't about wanting to *avoid* the tension, it was about not wanting to be treated like we were incapable of handling it. \n\nIt just felt\u2026patronizing. Like she didn't trust us to have our own feelings or to process what was happening. And honestly, it made me even *more* curious about what was going on downstairs. Which, of course, is exactly what she was trying to prevent.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes adults think they're protecting you, but they're really just shutting you out. And that's way worse. It's like, I get it, things are complicated. But I'm not stupid. I can handle a little bit of reality.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026complicated. It's something I've thought about a *lot*. Like, obsessively. It's not like picking out a flavor of ice cream, you know? It's a whole person's life we're talking about.\n\nThe idea of an open adoption\u2026it's tempting. Really tempting. It's like, getting to see that they're okay, that they're happy, that they're not, like, being raised by a family of axe murderers. Which, statistically, is probably low, but still. You worry.\n\nBut then I think about it more, and it feels\u2026weird. Like, I'm not trying to be their mom. I made a decision, a really hard decision, to give them a life I couldn't give them. And constantly getting updates\u2026it feels like I'm trying to be a part of their life when I shouldn't be. It feels selfish, almost.\n\nI want them to have a family, a *real* family, without me hovering around in the background. I don't want to be \"the girl who gave them up.\" I want them to just\u2026be.\n\nI think maybe a semi-open adoption is the way to go. Like, maybe a letter once in a while, through an agency. Just to know they're doing okay. But no constant photos and updates. No Facebook stalking. That just feels\u2026wrong.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's like, I want to be responsible, but I also want to let go. I want to know they're happy, but I don't want to interfere. It's a total mess of feelings, honestly.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, it's not a simple yes or no. It's something I need to really think about, and talk to Paul and Vanessa about. It has to be what's best for the baby, not what's best for me. Even if it means I don't get to see them grow up. That's the hardest part, you know?", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026not good. Not good at all.\n\nIt wasn't the *idea* of an open adoption that got to me, you know? I was already kinda on board with that. I wanted the baby to know me, to know where she came from. That felt important.\n\nBut Gerta, with her whole\u2026clinical detachment, just casually dropping that I'd have *no legal rights*? Like, I wouldn't even be a legal guardian or anything? That felt\u2026wrong. Really wrong.\n\nIt was like, I was already carrying this baby, dealing with all the stuff that came with it, and she was just talking about me being\u2026removed from the equation. Like I was a temporary vessel.\n\nI think I just kinda froze. I remember staring at her, trying to process what she'd said. It wasn't about wanting to *keep* the baby, it was about wanting to have some say in her life. Some responsibility. Some\u2026connection.\n\nIt felt like she was reducing me to just a means to an end. Like I wasn't a person with feelings, just a carrier.\n\nI think that's when it really hit me how serious this whole thing was. It wasn't just about giving a baby up for adoption. It was about giving up a part of myself. And it was about trusting someone else to do what I thought was best for her.\n\nIt was scary. It was really, really scary. And it made me question everything. But, you know, I figured it out. Eventually. It just took a lot of talking and a lot of thinking. And a lot of really awkward conversations with Mark.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa. She's\u2026intense. And honestly? It's kinda heartbreaking. It's like, she's got this whole life planned out, this perfect little picture in her head, and it's just not happening. And she's taking it *really* hard.\n\nIt's not that I don't get wanting a kid. I mean, I'm kinda in the middle of all that right now, and it's\u2026complicated. But Vanessa, she wants it for all the wrong reasons, you know? It's not about loving a child, it's about completing something, about fixing her life. It's about proving something to herself.\n\nAnd it's kinda scary, honestly. Like, she's so desperate, she's willing to do anything. And that's not a good place to be when you're talking about bringing a kid into the world.\n\nI feel bad for her, I really do. She's a good person, she's just\u2026lost. And she's putting a lot of pressure on herself, and on Mark. It's not fair to either of them.\n\nI just wish she could see that there are other ways to be happy. That having a kid isn't the answer to all your problems. But she's so focused on it, she can't see anything else.\n\nIt's just\u2026sad. And kinda frustrating. I mean, I'm dealing with my own stuff, and I don't really have the energy to be her therapist. But I feel like someone needs to tell her to slow down and breathe. And maybe get a hobby. Or a dog. Something other than obsessing over babies.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. And I hope she figures it out. For her sake, and for the sake of any future kid she might have.", "Ugh, okay, so you want my take on Mark and the whole dad thing? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's sweet, don't get me wrong. And he's trying. He *really* is. But when people ask him about being a dad, it's like he short-circuits. He gets all awkward and rambly and avoids actually saying anything meaningful. \n\nIt's not that he doesn't *want* to be a dad, I don't think. It's that he's just\u2026not equipped to deal with the emotional stuff. He's a skater kid, okay? He's used to ollies and kickflips, not diaper changes and bedtime stories.\n\nHe's good at the practical stuff, I guess. He's building the crib and picking out baby clothes and stuff. But when it comes to talking about feelings, or the responsibility of raising a human being, he just clams up.\n\nIt's frustrating, because I need to know he's in this with me. I need to know he's actually thought about what it means to be a father. Not just the fun parts, but the hard parts too.\n\nHe says he's excited, but it feels\u2026surface level. Like he's saying what he thinks he *should* say, not what he actually feels.\n\nI get it, though. It's scary. It's a huge commitment. And he's still figuring things out. But he needs to step up and actually *talk* about it. Because this isn't just about me anymore. It's about the baby. And the baby deserves a dad who's ready to be one, emotionally and otherwise.\n\nSo yeah, his responses are\u2026lacking. He needs to work on that. A lot. It's not about being perfect, it's about being honest and willing to face the reality of what's coming.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want me to unpack the Loring situation? Fine. It's not like I haven't had enough unpacking to do lately, right?\n\nIt's not that the Lorings are *bad* people, okay? They're\u2026enthusiastic. Like, aggressively friendly. And Mr. Loring stares. A lot. It's not a creepy stare, exactly, just\u2026intense. Like he's trying to figure out what makes me tick. And honestly, I don't even know what makes *me* tick half the time, so good luck with that.\n\nAnd Mrs. Loring is all about the \"positive vibes\" and the \"power of manifestation.\" Which, whatever. I'm all for being positive, but I'm also a realist. And her house is just\u2026suffocatingly perfect. Everything is beige and coordinated and smells like potpourri. It's like living in a catalog.\n\nI just feel like I have to be *on* when I'm there. Like I have to smile and nod and pretend to be interested in their antique doll collection. And I can't just be myself, you know? I can't slouch on the couch and listen to The Moldy Peaches and eat a whole bag of chips without feeling judged.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. It's like they're trying to mold me into something I'm not. And I'm already dealing with enough molding right now, if you catch my drift.\n\nSo yeah, being left unsupervised with the Lorings feels\u2026uncomfortable. It feels like I'm being observed. And I'm not a zoo animal. I'm a person. A slightly sarcastic, occasionally awkward person, but a person nonetheless.\n\nAnd honestly, I just need some space to breathe. And maybe eat some chips in peace. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like, a simple \"happy\" or \"sad\" thing, you know? It's complicated.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie. At first, it was mostly just\u2026relief. Relief that I didn't have to, like, raise a kid right now. I'm seventeen! I still haven't figured out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone a tiny human.\n\nBut then, getting to know Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really good people. They're so excited, and they're gonna be amazing parents. And that makes me feel\u2026good. Like, genuinely good.\n\nIt's weird, though. It's like, I'm giving them something really precious. Something that they really want. And that's a really big responsibility. It's not just a decision I made for myself, it's a decision that's gonna change their lives forever.\n\nI guess\u2026I feel proud. Proud that I could do this for them. Proud that I could give them the family they've always wanted. And I hope, I really hope, that this kid has a good life. A happy life.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't think about it, you know? It doesn't mean I don't wonder what things would be like if I kept it. But I know I made the right decision. For me, and for the baby.\n\nIt's still kinda scary, though. It's a big, messy, complicated thing. But mostly, I just hope they know how much I care. And that I'm happy for them. Really happy.\n\nIt's\u2026a gift, I guess. And I'm glad I could give it to them. Even if it's a little bit bittersweet.", "Ugh, okay, you want to revisit that? Seriously? It was a perfectly valid observation, okay? It's not *mocking* when it's just\u2026truth.\n\nIt's just\u2026Mark is, like, a really earnest guy. A little bit clueless, but earnest. And he's trying so hard to be cool and mature, right? And then he drops \"ASAP\" into a conversation like he invented it. \n\nIt's just\u2026so dated. It's like something my grandpa would say. It's not a natural way to talk. It's trying too hard. And I'm a connoisseur of people trying too hard. It's a hobby.\n\nPlus, it's just\u2026lazy. Like, can't you just say \"quickly\" or \"as soon as possible\"? It's not that hard. \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean, okay? I was just\u2026observing. And pointing out the absurdity of it all. It's my coping mechanism. I make fun of things to deal with my own feelings. Don't judge.\n\nAnd honestly, he deserved it. He was being all serious and responsible, and I needed to bring him down a notch. It's a delicate balance, you know? Keeping people grounded.\n\nIt's not about the \"ASAP\" itself. It's about what it represents. It's about trying to be something you're not. And I have zero tolerance for that.\n\n\n\nLook, I'm just a brutally honest person. It's a gift and a curse. Mostly a curse, if I'm being honest. But I can't help it. It's just who I am.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about guitars? Like I'm some kind of guitar aficionado? Please. I mostly just listen to them. But Paul, you know, he's really into guitars. And I've absorbed some knowledge by osmosis, I guess.\n\nHonestly? I'm not super picky. It's not like I'm gonna be shredding solos anytime soon. But if I *had* to pick a brand, I'd say **Fender**. Specifically, a Fender Telecaster.\n\nWhy? Because they're kinda\u2026unpretentious. They're not all flashy and showy like some of those other guitars. They're just solid, reliable, and they sound good. They're the kind of guitar a working musician would play, you know? Not some rock star who just wants to look cool.\n\nPlus, they're versatile. You can play pretty much any kind of music on a Telecaster. And they're not overly expensive, which is a bonus. I mean, I'm not exactly rolling in dough.\n\nPaul has a Telecaster, and it just feels\u2026right. It's got a worn-in look, like it's been through a lot. Which, I guess, is kinda like me.\n\nSo yeah, Fender Telecaster. It's a good guitar. Not too fancy, not too complicated. Just\u2026solid. Like a good pair of jeans. Or a really good slice of pizza. You know?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Melvins? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment fueled by\u2026well, a lot of things. Mostly wanting to impress Paul.\n\nLook, Paul was\u2026different. He was into music I didn't really get, and he was just\u2026cool. And I wanted him to think *I* was cool too. So when he started talking about the Melvins, and I had absolutely no idea who they were, my brain just short-circuited.\n\nIt just\u2026came out. I said I saw them at a show with my dad. A complete fabrication. A lie. A terrible, terrible lie.\n\nI thought he wouldn't question it. I thought I could just breeze past it. But then he started talking about specific songs and shows, and I was just digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole.\n\nIt was stupid. It was embarrassing. And it was totally unlike me. I usually pride myself on being honest, even when it's awkward. But in that moment, I just wanted to impress him.\n\nAnd honestly? It worked. For a little while, anyway. But lies have a way of unraveling, don't they?\n\nIt was a dumb move. A really dumb move. And I learned a valuable lesson: don't pretend to be someone you're not, especially when it comes to music. It just leads to awkward conversations and potential heartbreak.\n\nSo yeah, I lied about knowing the Melvins. Don't judge me too harshly. I was a teenager. I was trying to navigate the complexities of love and identity. And sometimes, teenagers do stupid things.\n\n\n\nIt's still mortifying to think about, honestly. Don't tell anyone I admitted that.", "Ugh, okay, Mark. Right. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand, sweeping romance or anything. That's not really my style. But playing music with him\u2026that was different.\n\nIt was the only time I felt like I could just\u2026be. You know? Like, not have to be witty or sarcastic or pretend I had everything figured out. With everyone else, I always felt like I had to be \"on.\" But with Mark, I could just be quiet and let the music do the talking.\n\nWhen we were playing, it wasn't about impressing each other or anything. It was just\u2026connecting. Like, our guitars were having a conversation, and we were just translating. And singing? That was even weirder. It felt\u2026vulnerable. Which is not a feeling I'm usually comfortable with.\n\nHe wasn't trying to fix me or change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026got it. He understood the quiet parts of me that I didn't even understand myself. And he didn't judge them.\n\nIt was a safe space, I guess. A place where I could be honest and real and messy. And it wasn't about romance, not really. It was about\u2026friendship. And maybe a little bit of something more, but I was too scared to admit it, even to myself.\n\nIt was just\u2026nice. A really nice, quiet, comfortable kind of nice. And honestly, I miss it. A lot. Even if I'd never say that out loud. Don't tell anyone I said that. Seriously.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's been, like, years. But fine, I'll explain. Again.\n\nIt was Paul's idea, mostly. He was obsessed with Teddy Roosevelt. Said he was a \"man of action\" and \"a progressive force for good.\" Which, okay, fine, whatever. I just wanted a name for the guitar, and Paul was being all enthusiastic about presidents.\n\nI didn't really *get* the connection at first. It's a guitar, not a national park. But then Paul explained that Roosevelt was a bit of a rebel, and he wasn't afraid to shake things up. And I guess\u2026I kinda related to that.\n\nI was shaking things up, you know? With the whole\u2026situation. And the guitar felt like a way to express myself, to be a little bit rebellious. So Roosevelt seemed to fit.\n\nPlus, it's a kinda goofy name. And I like goofy. It's better than, like, \"Shredzilla\" or something.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story of Roosevelt. It's a long story for a guitar name, I know. But Paul was a good guy. And he had good taste in presidents. Even if he was a little bit\u2026intense.\n\nDon't judge. It's a good name. And Roosevelt and I had some good times.", "Ugh. Okay, so the Vanessa and Mark situation. It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *want* to keep them in the dark, you know? They're good people. They're, like, genuinely excited about this whole adoption thing. But it's also *my* body, and *my* life, and it feels\u2026invasive, sometimes, having to constantly report back.\n\nIt's not that I don't trust them. It's just\u2026it's weird. They're gonna be the parents, eventually, but right now, I'm the one carrying the kid. And I need space to process everything. I need to feel like I have some control over the situation.\n\nPaul gets it. He's really good about letting me lead the way. But Vanessa and Mark\u2026they're a little more eager. They want to know everything. And I get that. They're anxious. But it's exhausting having to constantly be \"on,\" you know? Having to put on a brave face and pretend I'm totally cool with everything when sometimes I'm just\u2026not.\n\nI think it's important to keep them informed, obviously. They deserve to know what's going on. But I also need them to respect my boundaries. I need them to understand that I need time to myself, and that I'm not always going to be up for talking about the pregnancy.\n\nIt's a delicate balance. And honestly, I'm still figuring it out. It's like, I want them to be involved, but I also want to maintain some sense of my own identity. It's a lot.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's not a normal situation, okay? And I'm trying to navigate it the best way I can. And sometimes, that means setting some boundaries and saying, \"Hey, can we talk about this later?\" It's not personal. It's just\u2026me trying to survive.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want a whole explanation? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about this, like, a million times.\n\nLook, it's not about not wanting the baby, okay? It's about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I can't give it that. Not right now. Not ever, probably.\n\nI'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I'm not ready to give up my life, my dreams, my\u2026everything. And it's not fair to the baby to be brought into a situation where I'm just scrambling to keep things afloat.\n\nPaul and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They've been wanting this for so long. They have a beautiful house, a stable life, and they're just\u2026ready. They can give this baby everything I can't. A loving home, a good education, opportunities\u2026\n\nIt's not easy. It's the hardest decision I've ever made. And it's gonna hurt. A lot. But it's the right thing to do. It's the selfless thing to do.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm kinda scared of being a mom. It's a huge responsibility. And I'm not sure I'm up for it. Not yet. Maybe someday. But not now.\n\nSo yeah, I'm 104% sure. Because I've weighed all the options, and this is the best one. For everyone. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now. It's just\u2026the right thing to do. And sometimes, you just gotta do the right thing, even when it sucks.\n\n\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's complicated, okay? It's really, really complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't like, *happy* happy, you know? It was more like\u2026relieved happy. Like they could finally breathe again. And honestly? A little bit of me was relieved too.\n\nIt was weird seeing them all\u2026excited. Like they'd won a prize or something. I mean, I *was* the prize, in a way. The baby. The thing they'd been wanting for so long. \n\nI tried not to take it personally. I knew they were good people. They were just\u2026really, really eager. And I was, like, a walking, talking reminder of a really messy situation.\n\nIt felt a little bit like I was interrupting something. Like their life was on pause until I showed up, and then they could finally hit play again. Which, I guess, is kinda what I was doing. Letting them hit play.\n\nI remember Mark doing that little fist pump thing he does when he's excited. And Gerta was practically bouncing. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nI just wanted to get out of there. I wanted to go back to my life, to my music, to Paul. I didn't want to be the center of attention anymore. \n\nSo, did it sting a little? Yeah, maybe. But I also understood it. They were getting their dream. And I was\u2026moving on. It was just\u2026awkward. Really awkward. And I was really good at awkward.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't anger, or sadness, or anything like that. It was just\u2026a feeling of being a little bit out of place. Like I was a guest at a party I wasn't really invited to.", "Ugh. Seriously? People are *talking*? Like, I'm some kind of zoo animal or something? It's\u2026 irritating, okay? Beyond irritating. It's my life, and frankly, it's none of anyone else's business.\n\nLook, it's not exactly a secret, but it's also not something I'm exactly broadcasting from the rooftops. It's complicated. And it's personal. And the fact that people are gossiping about it like it's some kind of reality show is just\u2026rude.\n\nI get it, small town, nothing much happens, people need something to talk about. But honestly, can't they find something more interesting? Like, who's dating who at the gas station? Or whether or not Mr. Abernathy is *still* wearing that hideous sweater vest?\n\nIt's just\u2026 I'm trying to figure things out, okay? I'm trying to make a really big decision, and I don't need a bunch of judgmental eyes and whispered conversations making it harder. \n\nAnd the rumors? They're always wrong. Always. People love to fill in the blanks with their own assumptions and drama. It's exhausting.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? I feel like telling everyone to mind their own business. But that's probably not going to happen. So I'm just trying to ignore it and focus on what's important. Which is, you know, *my* life. Not everyone else's opinions about it.\n\nCan we just\u2026change the subject? Please? I need a distraction. Maybe we can talk about music. Or the ridiculousness of high school. Anything but this.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't make me get all mushy, alright? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I wake up every day all sunshine and rainbows about it. It's kinda terrifying, actually.\n\nLike, I'm growing a *person*. Inside me. And then I'm supposed to\u2026give them away? It doesn't feel right, you know? It feels\u2026wrong. Like I'm failing at something. Even though everyone keeps telling me I'm not.\n\nBut then I think about it, and I think about Mark and Vanessa, and how much they want this. And how good they'd be at being parents. They have a house, and a stable life, and they're just\u2026ready. And I'm\u2026not. Not even close.\n\nI'm sixteen. I still eat cereal for dinner sometimes. I'm not exactly equipped to raise a human being.\n\nSo, yeah, it's scary. It's sad. It's gonna be really, really hard. But I think\u2026I think it's the right thing to do. For the baby. They deserve a good life, and I want to give them that. Even if it means giving them to someone else.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't love them. It just means I love them enough to want what's best for them. And what's best for them isn't me, right now.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. And I'm trying to be brave about it. But sometimes, I just wanna curl up in a ball and cry. And that's okay too, I guess. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nJust\u2026don't ask me about it too much, okay? It's still kinda raw.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole surprise baby thing? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *wanted* to mess with Mark and Vanessa, okay? It's just\u2026they're so *prepared*. Like, they have the nursery already decorated, and they've picked out names for both a boy and a girl. It's kinda intense.\n\nAnd honestly? I think they needed a little bit of\u2026unpredictability. They've planned everything out so perfectly, it's almost sterile. Like, they're so focused on being perfect parents, they're forgetting to just\u2026*be*.\n\nI figured if they didn't know what they were getting, it would force them to be a little more flexible, a little more open to whatever happens. It's like, life isn't always what you expect, you know? And parenting definitely isn't.\n\nPlus, it's kinda fun to watch people be surprised. Don't judge me. I have a weird sense of humor.\n\nIt's not about me wanting to control things, okay? It's about wanting them to experience the full range of emotions that come with having a baby. The joy, the fear, the uncertainty\u2026it's all part of the package.\n\nAnd honestly, I just wanted to give them a little something that was *mine*. Like, I made the decision about the adoption, and I carried the baby. This was a small way for me to still have a little bit of input, you know?\n\nIt's not a big deal, really. It's just a baby's sex. But sometimes, the little things are the most important.", "Ugh. Seriously? That lady. I swear, she was sizing me up the *entire* time. Like I was some case study or something. It wasn't about *me* and my baby, it was about her preconceived notions about girls like me.\n\nIt was\u2026infuriating. And honestly, really hurtful. Like, I already knew people were gonna judge me. My parents, the school, probably even the grocery store lady. But I didn't need a professional, someone I was supposed to trust, to pile on.\n\nShe kept making these little comments, you know? About how \"brave\" I was, and how \"difficult\" this must be, and how \"most\" girls my age aren't prepared for motherhood. Like I was some statistic. Like my feelings didn't matter.\n\nIt wasn't about being \"brave.\" It was about making a really hard decision, a decision that was right for *me* and for the baby. And it wasn't about being \"prepared\" for motherhood, it was about being prepared to give this baby the life it deserved, even if that life wasn't with me.\n\nI wanted to tell her to just\u2026stop. Stop assuming things. Stop judging me. But I was too stunned to say anything. I just stared at the screen, trying to focus on the little blob that was growing inside me, and trying to ignore the fact that this woman thought she knew my life better than I did.\n\nIt made me even more determined to do things my way. To find a good family for the baby, and to make sure everyone understood that this wasn't some careless mistake. It was a choice. A really, really hard choice. And I was doing the best I could.\n\nHonestly, it just made me want to roll my eyes and tell her to mind her own business. But I'm polite. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the real deal, huh? It wasn't all witty banter and ironic t-shirts, okay? There were\u2026complications. A lot of them.\n\nThe biggest thing, honestly, was just\u2026being sixteen. Like, seriously? Sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. Everyone kept treating me like a kid, which was infuriating, but also\u2026they weren't wrong.\n\nThen there was the judgment. Oh, the judgment. People at school whispering, my dad being\u2026well, my dad, initially. Even some of my friends didn't really *get* it. They were all talking about prom and college applications, and I was over here trying to decide if I wanted a C-section or not. It felt\u2026isolating.\n\nAnd the adoption process itself? Bureaucracy is a *nightmare*. So many forms, so many meetings, so many people asking me personal questions. It felt like I was being dissected. And the fear of picking the \"wrong\" parents? That was huge. I wanted this kid to have the best life possible, and the weight of that decision was\u2026intense.\n\nThen there was the emotional stuff. Like, actually *feeling* the baby move inside me. That was\u2026weird. And then realizing I was going to have to give it up. That was the hardest part, hands down. Even knowing it was the right thing to do, it didn't make it any easier. It felt like giving away a piece of myself.\n\nAnd honestly, just dealing with my own feelings about everything. I was angry, I was scared, I was sad, I was confused. It was a total emotional rollercoaster. I tried to be all sarcastic and detached, but underneath it all, I was just a really messed up teenager trying to do the best she could.\n\nIt wasn't glamorous, okay? It was messy and complicated and really, really hard. But it also taught me a lot about myself, about responsibility, and about what it means to be a good person. And that, I guess, was worth all the drama.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me get all\u2026emotional. It's not my strong suit. But yeah, this whole thing\u2026it\u2019s kinda flipped my world upside down. Before, love was, like, in movies. Or in songs. Something other people dealt with. Responsibility was doing my homework and not failing history. And growing up was\u2026something that happened to other people, eventually.\n\nNow? Love is\u2026complicated. It's not just butterflies and holding hands. It's wanting the best for someone, even if it means letting them go. It's seeing Paul, and realizing he's a good guy, a *really* good guy, and wanting him to be happy, even if that happiness doesn't include me. It's seeing how much Mark and Vanessa want this baby, and knowing they'll give it a good life. It's not romantic, it's\u2026real. It's messy.\n\nResponsibility? That's a whole other level. It's not just about me anymore. It's about this little person, this life I created. It's about making the right choices, even when they're hard. It's about thinking beyond my own wants and needs. It's about being a grown-up, even though I still feel like a kid half the time.\n\nAnd growing up\u2026well, that happened fast. It wasn't a gradual thing, it was more like getting hit by a bus. I went from worrying about college applications and band practice to\u2026this. It forced me to confront things I wasn't ready for. It forced me to figure out who I am, what I believe in, and what I want out of life.\n\nI used to think growing up meant becoming serious and boring. But it's not about that. It's about finding your own voice, your own strength. It's about learning to navigate the world, even when it's scary and confusing.\n\nIt's still scary, honestly. But I'm not as scared as I used to be. I think\u2026I think I'm okay. I'm still me, still sarcastic and a little bit cynical. But I'm also\u2026stronger. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit wiser.\n\nIt's weird, right? Getting pregnant at sixteen and actually learning something about life. Go figure.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about *that* house? It's not like I'm, like, obsessed or anything. It's just\u2026weird. And I'm a connoisseur of weird.\n\nIt's just sitting there, you know? All dusty and forgotten. Like a time capsule of someone else's life. And it's not just *any* abandoned house. It's a fully furnished living room. Just\u2026stuck there in the middle of the woods. Like someone just walked out mid-conversation and never came back.\n\nPaul thinks I'm being creepy. He says I should stop biking past it every day. But it's on my route to the library! It's not my fault it's there.\n\nI just\u2026I keep imagining who lived there. What their life was like. Why they left everything behind. It's like a story waiting to be told. And I'm a good storyteller, even if I do say so myself.\n\nIt's also kinda sad, you know? All those memories just\u2026rotting away. It makes you think about how fleeting everything is. And how easily things can fall apart.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm interested. It's a mystery. And I like mysteries. Don't judge me. It's not like I'm planning to move in or anything. Though, the floral wallpaper *is* kinda growing on me\u2026\n\nJust leave me alone about it, okay? It's my weird thing. Everyone has one.", "Ugh. Don't even *start* with the Wizard. That guy\u2026 seriously. It still gives me the creeps thinking about it.\n\nOkay, so, he whispers that whole \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\" thing when I go down to his basement to get the record. And it's not about the record, okay? It's not about music at all. It's\u2026icky.\n\nHe's a lonely, weird dude, and he's been fixating on me for a long time. He's been watching me, observing me, and building up this whole fantasy in his head. He thinks I'm\u2026special, or something. And he's been waiting for an opportunity to, like, connect with me.\n\nIt's creepy because it's not a normal, healthy kind of wanting. It's possessive and unsettling. He doesn't see me as a person, he sees me as an object of his affection. And that's just\u2026wrong.\n\nI didn't really understand the full extent of it at the time, I was just trying to get the record for Paulie Bleeker. But looking back, it's clear that he was way over the line. It's a really uncomfortable moment, and it's one of the reasons why I was so relieved to get out of that basement.\n\nHonestly, it's a reminder that not everyone has good intentions. And sometimes, you just have to trust your gut and get away from people who make you feel uncomfortable. Even if they have a cool record collection.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're dissecting my life choices now? Fine. It's not like I have anything better to do.\n\nLook, it wasn't just *any* empty juice container. It was a SunnyD container. And SunnyD is, like, the official drink of questionable decisions. It just felt\u2026wrong. Like, a symbol of everything that was going sideways. So yeah, I chucked it. Dramatic, I know. But sometimes you gotta make a statement.\n\nAnd then I rushed to Dancing Elk because I needed a pregnancy test. *Another* one. Because, you know, denial is a powerful thing. And I'd already used up all the ones at home. And Paul was at band practice, and I couldn't just sit around and wait for him to get back. I needed to *know*. \n\nIt wasn't about being responsible or anything. It was about needing to confirm what I already suspected. And Dancing Elk is the closest drugstore. It's not rocket science.\n\nHonestly, it was a whole mess of feelings and hormones and panic. And SunnyD. Don't forget the SunnyD. It's always SunnyD that starts everything.\n\nSo yeah, I rushed. Because I needed answers. And because I was freaking out. Is that a good enough explanation for you?", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026a moment.\n\nOkay, so, I was at the drugstore with Paul, getting, like, a pregnancy test or something equally mortifying. And this girl, she was\u2026intense. Like, really into the whole \"natural woman\" thing. She was wearing, like, a hemp necklace and Birkenstocks, even though it was November.\n\nAnd she just\u2026stared. And then, out of nowhere, she just *asked* me, really loudly, if my nipples were real brown. Like, it was a legitimate question she needed answered.\n\nI was completely stunned. I just kind of blinked at her. And Paul, of course, turned bright red.\n\nI think she was trying to make some point about authenticity or something. Like, she was judging me for\u2026having normal nipples? I don't even know. It was so weird and random.\n\nI just mumbled something about not discussing my anatomy with strangers and tried to walk away. But she followed us for a bit, still muttering about \"realness.\"\n\nIt was just\u2026one of those things that happened. Life is full of awkward encounters, you know? And that one definitely made the list. It's a story I'll probably be telling for the rest of my life, just to make other people feel better about their own embarrassing moments.\n\nHonestly, it was just\u2026rude. And completely unnecessary. Some people are just\u2026strange.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She was\u2026essential. Seriously. If I didn't have Leah, I probably would have just run away to Canada or something. Not that Canada's bad, it's just\u2026cold. And I don't do well with cold.\n\nBefore everything happened, Leah was just my best friend. We spent hours at the record store, making fun of people, and generally being cynical teenagers. She was the one person who *got* me, you know? She didn't try to change me or tell me what to do. She just\u2026listened.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I told her first. And she didn't freak out. She didn't judge me. She just\u2026was there. She helped me figure out what to do, even when I was being a total mess. She was the one who suggested adoption, actually. I hadn't even considered it before.\n\nShe came with me to all the doctor's appointments, even the awkward ones. She helped me pick out baby names (which was surprisingly hard). She even tried to knit a baby blanket, which was a disaster, but it was the thought that counted.\n\nHonestly, she was my rock. Paul was great, and my dad was trying, but they didn't *get* what it was like to be a pregnant teenager. Leah did. She knew how scared I was, how confused, how overwhelmed.\n\nShe didn't let me wallow for too long, either. She kept me grounded and reminded me that I still had a life to live. She made me laugh when I wanted to cry. She was just\u2026a really good friend.\n\nI think the whole experience brought us even closer. It was a tough time, but we got through it together. And I know I couldn't have done it without her. She's the best. Don't tell her I said that, though. She'll get all smug.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really, really awkward moment. Honestly, it wasn't some grand plan, okay? It was mostly just\u2026desperation. And a little bit of spite.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they were all about the perfect life. The perfect house, the perfect job, the perfect future. And they were treating finding a family like it was another item on their to-do list. Like picking out curtains. It just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nThey kept asking me about my plans, like I was supposed to have everything figured out. And they were so focused on finding the \u201cright\u201d parents, the ones who could give the baby everything. It was all so clinical.\n\nSo, I thought, you know what? They need to see this is *real*. This isn't some abstract concept. This is a tiny human being growing inside of me. And they need to connect with that.\n\nI figured if they actually *saw* the ultrasound, if they actually saw the little bean, maybe they'd stop treating it like a transaction. Maybe they'd start thinking about it as a life.\n\nIt was a gamble, I know. It was totally inappropriate. But I was feeling really overwhelmed and powerless, and it was the only thing I could think of to shake them up.\n\nAnd it worked, kinda. They were\u2026stunned. And then they were quiet. And then Vanessa started crying. It was messy. But it was also\u2026important.\n\nIt wasn't about trying to guilt them or anything. It was about making them see the reality of the situation. It was about reminding them that this wasn't just about them. It was about a baby. And that baby deserved parents who were truly ready.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it happened. It was a stupid, impulsive, probably-shouldn't-have-done-it kind of thing. But sometimes, you just gotta do what you gotta do.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark says Vanessa isn't home. Right. My initial reaction? It wasn't, like, a dramatic gasp or anything. It was more of a\u2026slow burn of suspicion. Like a tiny little alarm bell started ringing in my head, but it was playing a really quiet, annoying tune.\n\nI think I probably just raised an eyebrow and said something sarcastic. Probably something like, \"Oh, really? That's\u2026convenient.\" Because, honestly, what are the odds? He's all nervous and fidgety, and suddenly the girl he's supposedly madly in love with is mysteriously absent? Yeah, right.\n\nIt wasn't that I thought he was *immediately* cheating or something. It was more that I just\u2026didn't buy it. It felt off. Like he was trying too hard to be casual about it. And Mark is not a casual person. He's a sensitive, guitar-playing, feelings-wearer-on-his-sleeve kind of guy.\n\nSo, yeah. Suspicious. Definitely suspicious. And a little bit annoyed, because I was hoping to get this whole thing over with quickly and get back to my life. But noooo, of course there had to be complications. It's always something, isn't it?\n\nIt was the beginning of a whole lot of awkwardness, let me tell you. And a whole lot of questioning everything. Because, seriously, people are weird.", "Ugh, okay, look. It's not that I *wanted* to be a jerk to Mark, okay? It just\u2026slipped out. It's a reflex. A defense mechanism. A way to deflect from, like, actual feelings.\n\nHe was all proud about doing those commercials for, like, car dealerships or something. And it just struck me as\u2026weird. He's a musician, right? He's supposed to be all about artistic integrity and expressing yourself. And then he's selling cars? It felt\u2026contradictory.\n\nIt's not that I think there's anything *wrong* with making money. Everyone needs to pay the bills. But it just felt like he was compromising his art for a paycheck. And I have a really strong aversion to people compromising their art. It feels\u2026sad.\n\nPlus, he was being all earnest and enthusiastic about it, and it just felt like he was trying too hard. And when people try too hard, I automatically want to make fun of them. It's a flaw, I know.\n\nI didn't mean to hurt his feelings, okay? I just\u2026I say what's on my mind. Sometimes it's not the most tactful thing, but it's me. And honestly, he's a pretty chill guy. He probably didn't even notice. Or if he did, he didn't let on.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes people do things that make me question everything. And I deal with it by making sarcastic comments. It's a coping mechanism. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Mark and the ultrasound. It was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It was kinda the first time I felt, like, genuinely *scared* about the whole thing.\n\nHe just\u2026froze. Like a deer in headlights. And then he started talking about college funds and baby-proofing and\u2026it wasn't about *us*. It wasn't about the baby being a person, it was about logistics. About how this was going to mess up *his* life.\n\nAnd I get it, okay? He's seventeen. He's got plans. He's supposed to be going to college and playing music and, you know, being a teenager. But the way he reacted\u2026it felt like he saw the baby as an obstacle, not a little human being.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. And kinda alone. Like I was the only one who was actually thinking about the baby as something more than just a problem to be solved.\n\nI mean, I knew he wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, but I expected\u2026I don't know\u2026some kind of emotion? Some kind of connection? Instead, it was just\u2026panic.\n\nIt made me realize that maybe he wasn't as ready for this as I thought he was. And it made me even more determined to find the perfect parents for the baby. Parents who would actually *want* it. Parents who would be excited about it.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. And it definitely made me question things. It made me realize that this wasn't just about me anymore. It was about the baby. And I needed to do what was best for the baby, even if it meant making some tough decisions.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me wanna eat a whole box of cheese puffs. It was a rough day.", "Ugh. Okay, so Havenbrooke. That place\u2026 it smelled like antiseptic and regret. And the people protesting outside? Seriously, the judgment. Like they hadn't ever made a mistake.\n\nThe possibility of getting an abortion there\u2026 it wasn't like I was *excited* about it, okay? It wasn't a fun option. It was just\u2026an option. And a really hard one.\n\nAt first, it felt like the easiest way out. Like, \"Okay, problem solved. Back to normal.\" But then you actually *go* to Havenbrooke, and you see the other girls, and you start thinking about it, and it's not so easy anymore.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, exactly. It was about\u2026 not being ready. Not being able to give it the life it deserved. I was seventeen, for crying out loud. I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a kid.\n\nBut then you start thinking about what it *is* \u2013 a person. A tiny person. And it's not just a blob of cells, even though that's what some people try to tell you. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nI felt really conflicted. Scared. Guilty. Like I was letting everyone down. My parents, Paul, even the baby. It felt like a really big decision, and I didn't want to mess it up.\n\nHonestly, it was the worst feeling in the world. Like being stuck in a really bad movie where you don't know how it ends. And everyone keeps telling you what you *should* do, but nobody actually knows what's best for *you*.\n\nIt wasn't a decision I took lightly. It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of trying to figure out what was the right thing to do. And it wasn't about being pro-choice or pro-life. It was about being pro-*me*, and trying to make the best decision for my life, and for the baby's life, too.\n\nIt was\u2026 a lot.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026awkward. You want me to talk about Bleeker? Seriously? It's not like I spend my days reminiscing about high school romance, okay? But fine. You asked.\n\nBleeker and I\u2026we were friends first. Like, *really* friends. He was always just\u2026there. Quiet, kinda dorky, but sweet. He was the one who always listened when I was rambling about stuff, and he didn't judge me for being, well, me. Which is a pretty big deal, considering how much I ramble and how weird I can be.\n\nWe hung out a lot, mostly just walking around, listening to music, and talking. He was a good listener, and he made me laugh. He wasn't trying to be cool or impress me or anything. He just\u2026was. And that was nice.\n\nI think I started to see him as more than a friend around the time I found out I was pregnant. Everything was so messed up and scary, and he was the one person who didn't freak out. He didn't try to fix things or tell me what to do. He just\u2026supported me. He brought me soup and listened to me cry and held my hand.\n\nAs for when we\u2026you know\u2026became intimate? That was\u2026complicated. It wasn't some grand romantic gesture or anything. It was more like\u2026a gradual thing. We were both scared and confused and vulnerable. And we were both just trying to find some comfort in each other.\n\nIt happened after I'd made the decision to give the baby up for adoption. I was a mess, obviously. And he was just\u2026there. We were talking, and then we weren't. It wasn't planned, and it wasn't perfect. But it felt\u2026right. In a weird, messed-up kind of way.\n\nIt wasn't about sex, really. It was about connection. About needing someone to hold onto when everything else was falling apart. It was about finding a little bit of happiness in a really difficult situation.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale romance, okay? It was messy and complicated and imperfect. But it was real. And it helped me get through a really tough time.\n\nLook, I'm not going to get into any more detail than that. It's personal. And honestly, it's a little embarrassing to talk about. Just\u2026we were two kids trying to figure things out. And we found some comfort in each other. That's all.\n\n\n\nCan we talk about something else now? Please?", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're asking me about *that*? It's\u2026still a lot, even now.\n\nHonestly? It was terrifying. Like, full-blown, heart-stopping, can't-breathe terrifying. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about getting my driver's license and applying to colleges, not\u2026growing a human.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026numb. Like, this can't be happening. It felt like something out of a movie, but a really bad one. And then the panic set in. What would my parents say? What would everyone at school think? What was I going to *do*?\n\nBleeker was\u2026sweet. He was genuinely freaked out too, but he was trying to be supportive. Which was nice, I guess. But he was Bleeker. He was kinda clueless. And I didn't want to be a mom. Not then. Not ever, really.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't think I could be a good mom. It was that I wasn't *ready*. I had my own life to figure out. I had dreams. And a baby\u2026that just felt like it would derail everything.\n\nSo, I started thinking about other options. And that's when I started looking into adoption. It wasn't an easy decision. It was probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But it felt like the right thing to do. For me, and for the baby.\n\nIt was\u2026complicated. I loved that little kid, even before I met her. And giving her up was heartbreaking. But I knew that I couldn't give her the life she deserved. And I wanted her to have parents who were ready and willing to give her everything.\n\nSo yeah. It was scary. It was sad. It was confusing. But it was also\u2026empowering. Because I made a choice. And I stood by that choice. And that's what mattered.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think about her sometimes. But I know I did the right thing. And that's enough.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack, okay? Can we talk about something else now? Maybe music? Or tater tots?", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on that. Telling Bleeker\u2026 it was\u2026 a whole thing. It wasn't like some romantic movie moment, okay? It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI mean, he's Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, perpetually covered in guitar strings. Not exactly the guy you picture having a serious conversation with about, you know, *gestating a human*.\n\nI didn't just blurt it out, obviously. I tried to ease into it. I started talking about how things were\u2026 complicated. And then I just kind of\u2026 dropped the bomb. I think I said something like, \"So, um, there's this thing. And it's inside me. And it's, like, growing.\" Smooth, right?\n\nHe just stared at me. Like a deer in headlights. For a *long* time. He didn't say anything. He just blinked. And then he asked if I was sick. Like, did I have a stomach bug or something?\n\nI was so mad. But also, kinda relieved he didn't freak out immediately.\n\nThen he started rambling about how his mom always wanted grandkids, and how he wasn't ready to be a dad, and how he still lived with his parents. It was a lot.\n\nI just cut him off and said, \"Look, I'm not asking you to be a dad. I'm just telling you.\"\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It was messy and uncomfortable and full of a lot of silence. But he listened. And eventually, he came around. He wasn't thrilled, obviously, but he was supportive. In his own Bleeker-y way.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was just\u2026 a mess. But that's life, right? It's rarely how you picture it. And sometimes, the best you can do is just be honest and hope for the best. Even if the best is just a really awkward conversation with a guitar-playing boy.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not like a simple answer, you know? It wasn't, like, a happy-cry-at-the-hospital kind of thing. It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026panic. Like, full-blown, can't-breathe panic. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone for the next eighteen years of my life. Having a baby just\u2026didn't fit into the plan. There *wasn't* a plan.\n\nBut then, after the initial freak-out, it started to feel\u2026right. Not good, exactly. But right. I realized I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped. I wanted to give this kid the best life possible, and I knew I couldn't do that. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nIt was really hard letting go. Seeing her with Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were so excited, so prepared. It was amazing, and it was heartbreaking all at the same time. It felt like giving away a piece of myself.\n\nThere were definitely moments where I questioned everything. Wondered if I'd made the right decision. If I was being selfish. But then I'd remember that I wanted her to have a stable home, a loving family, opportunities I couldn't provide.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting her. It was about wanting what was best *for her*. And that meant letting her go.\n\nIt still stings sometimes. I think about her a lot. But I also feel\u2026peaceful. Knowing she's happy and loved. And knowing I did the best I could. It wasn't the easiest thing I've ever done, not by a long shot. But it was the right thing.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. A lot. It forced me to face some really tough stuff and figure out who I was and what I wanted. And that's something I'll always be grateful for. Even if it was really, really hard.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know my musical tastes? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I have a super refined playlist or anything. It kinda depends on my mood, you know?\n\nBut generally, I'm into stuff that's kinda quirky and honest. Not a lot of super polished, manufactured pop. I need something with a little bit of\u2026edge.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches are, like, my all-time favorites. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are just\u2026real. They make me feel things.\n\nI also listen to a lot of indie rock. Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins\u2026that kinda stuff. It's good for thinking and staring out the window.\n\nI'm also kinda into older stuff, like The Velvet Underground and Patti Smith. They're just\u2026cool.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly angsty, I'll listen to some punk rock. But not the super aggressive stuff. More like\u2026early The Clash.\n\nI don't really listen to a lot of mainstream stuff. It just feels\u2026fake. I need music that feels authentic, you know? Something that speaks to the awkwardness and the messiness of life.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much it. The Moldy Peaches, indie rock, some older stuff, and a little bit of punk. It's a weird mix, I know. But it's me.\n\nDon't ask me about country music, though. That's just\u2026a hard no.", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" Right. That movie is\u2026something else.\n\nLook, I appreciate a good, weird, low-budget horror flick as much as the next person. I mean, I've seen my share of questionable VHS tapes. But \"The Wizard of Gore\" is on a whole other level of\u2026intense.\n\nIt's not *scary* scary, you know? It's more\u2026uncomfortable. And kinda gross. And the special effects are\u2026well, they're special, alright. Special in a \"did they make that out of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and ketchup?\" kind of way.\n\nI will give it credit for being committed to its weirdness. It doesn't try to be anything it's not. It's just a gloriously sleazy, over-the-top gorefest. And the whole \"monster movie within a movie\" thing is kinda clever, I guess.\n\nBut honestly? It's not something I'd watch again. It's a little too much, even for me. I prefer my horror with a little more\u2026subtlety. And maybe fewer dismemberments.\n\nIt's the kind of movie you watch with a group of friends and then spend the next hour making fun of it. Which, I guess, is a good thing? It's memorable, at least.\n\nSo, my opinion? It's\u2026a choice. A very specific choice. And not one I necessarily endorse. But hey, if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. Just don't say I didn't warn you. It's definitely not for the faint of heart. Or stomach.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. Like, I've heard way worse. Brenda. Seriously, Brenda? But Madison\u2026it feels kinda\u2026basic.\n\nIt was super popular when I was a kid, and now it just feels\u2026dated. Like, a lot of girls named Madison are probably in college right now, majoring in something practical like business. No offense to business majors.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it's just\u2026predictable. It doesn't have a lot of personality, you know? It doesn't scream \"unique individual\" or \"future indie filmmaker.\" It screams \"soccer mom\" or \"cheerleader.\"\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't name your kid Madison if you like it. It's your kid. But if you're looking for something a little more\u2026interesting\u2026maybe keep looking. There are a lot of cool names out there. Like, Beatrix. Or Clementine. Or even Juno. Just sayin'.\n\nIt's not a terrible name. It's just\u2026not my vibe. It's a perfectly fine name for a perfectly fine person. But if you want a kid who's gonna stand out, maybe go with something a little less\u2026Madison.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not exactly a fun one to think about, even for me, and I *lived* it.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not like flipping a switch. It's not like deciding what color to paint your room. It's\u2026a whole thing.\n\nAt first, it feels like the worst thing in the world. Like you're giving away a piece of yourself. And you are. You totally are. It's a really, really hard decision. And there were days, a lot of days, where I just wanted to keep him. Even though I knew I couldn't.\n\nBut then you start to think about what's best for the baby. And that's not always what's best for *you*. I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I had, like, zero life experience. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *myself*, let alone a kid.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited. They were ready. They could give him a life I just couldn't. A stable life. A good life.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It still hurts. It always will, probably. But knowing that he's loved and cared for\u2026that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nIt's not a selfish decision, even though it feels like it sometimes. It's a responsible one. It's about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to grieve. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to feel all the feelings. It doesn't mean you made the wrong decision. It just means you're human.\n\nIt's\u2026a lot. It's a lot to process. But it's also a really brave thing to do. And it's something I wouldn't change, even if I could. Because he deserves the best life possible. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give him that.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's not easy. And anyone who says it is is probably lying.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want the inside scoop, huh? It's\u2026a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not exactly what you picture when you're, like, obsessing over which band is cooler or trying to avoid gym class.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just try to compartmentalize. Which is a fancy way of saying I pretend things aren't happening until I absolutely have to deal with them. It's a survival mechanism, okay?\n\nThe biggest thing is, I had to grow up, like, *fast*. I mean, I was already pretty sarcastic and independent, but this forced me to actually be responsible. Which is\u2026annoying. But also, kinda empowering, I guess.\n\nThe school thing was hard. People definitely noticed. There was whispering, and stares, and just\u2026awkwardness. I mostly just ignored it. Or made a snarky comment. That usually shut people up. Paulie Bleeker was a good buffer, though. He's a good egg.\n\nMy parents were\u2026complicated. My dad was mostly just confused, and my mom was trying to be supportive, but also kinda freaked out. It took a while for them to come around.\n\nBut the biggest pressure was just\u2026making the right decision. About the baby. About my future. It wasn't easy. It was scary. And I definitely cried a lot.\n\nI leaned on a lot of people. My best friend, Leah. Vanessa, the girl I met at the clinic. And even Mark, the guy who\u2026well, you know. He wasn't exactly father-of-the-year material, but he was there when I needed him to be.\n\nI think the key is to just\u2026be honest. With yourself, and with the people you trust. And to remember that you're not alone. There are other people who have been through this. And you can get through it too.\n\nIt's still hard, you know? Even after everything. But I'm learning. And I'm figuring things out. And I'm trying to be okay with the fact that life is messy and unpredictable.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes, a really good mix CD and a sarcastic comment are all you need to get through the day.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the whole point of being me is doing things my way, right? Being self-sufficient. Not needing anyone. But then, life throws you a curveball \u2013 or, in my case, a positive pregnancy test \u2013 and suddenly you realize you can't do everything alone.\n\nIt's a constant battle, honestly. I *hate* asking for help. It feels like admitting defeat, like I'm not strong enough. But I've learned, slowly, that it's not about weakness. It's about\u2026smartness.\n\nI think it's about picking your battles. I need to be in control of the big stuff \u2013 the decisions about the baby, what I want to do with my life. But that doesn't mean I can't lean on people for support.\n\nPaul, he's\u2026good. He doesn't try to tell me what to do, he just *listens*. And he helps with the practical stuff, like, you know, building furniture and not freaking out when I'm being a total mess. And my dad, he's surprisingly supportive, even if he doesn't always understand.\n\nI guess it's about recognizing that needing help doesn't make you less independent. It just makes you human. And it's about finding people you trust, people who will respect your choices and be there for you without judgment.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, though. I still get this urge to just shut everyone out and handle everything myself. But I'm learning to let go a little bit. To accept that sometimes, it's okay to need someone.\n\nIt's a weird balance, but I'm figuring it out. Or, at least, I'm trying to. It's all about finding your own way, right? Even if that way involves asking for a little help along the way.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like some fairytale romance, you know? It started out as just\u2026hanging out. He was this quiet, sweet guy who played guitar, and I was just trying to navigate high school and avoid drama. We bonded over records and a shared appreciation for being slightly weird.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, I kinda pushed him away. I didn't want him to feel obligated or anything. I was all, \"This is *my* problem,\" and I was determined to handle it on my own. I thought he'd freak out, and honestly, I wasn't sure I wanted him to stick around. I was scared, and I didn't want to drag him into my mess.\n\nBut he didn't freak out. He was\u2026supportive. In his own quiet way. He didn't offer a lot of grand gestures or empty promises. He just *showed up*. He'd bring me orange juice when I was nauseous, he'd listen when I needed to vent, and he'd just\u2026be there.\n\nAs the pregnancy went on, and I started to realize I couldn't do this completely alone, I started to rely on him more. He wasn't trying to fix things, he was just trying to help. And that meant a lot.\n\nIt wasn't always easy. We had a lot of awkward conversations, and there were times when I was just plain mean to him. I was dealing with a lot, and I didn't always handle it well. But he always forgave me.\n\nBy the end, he wasn't just a friend. He was\u2026someone I cared about a lot. Someone I trusted. Someone who understood me, even when I didn't understand myself.\n\nIt wasn't a traditional love story, and we didn't end up together in the end. But he was a really important part of my journey. He helped me get through a really tough time, and I'll always be grateful for that. He showed me that even when things are messy and complicated, there's still room for kindness and support. And that's a pretty valuable lesson, you know?", "Ugh, okay, this question *still* comes up. Seriously? It was a phase. A very specific, slightly pretentious phase.\n\nMy dad, he's\u2026into mythology. Like, *really* into mythology. He's always reading those books and talking about gods and goddesses. And when I was born, he was on a big Greek mythology kick. He thought it would be \"ironic\" to name me after Juno, the queen of the gods, because, you know, I was this tiny little person.\n\nHe thought it was clever. I thought it was embarrassing.\n\nI didn't ask for the name, okay? It just *happened*. And honestly, I didn't really care one way or the other for a long time. It's just a name.\n\nBut then, I started thinking about it. Juno was powerful, and she was a protector of women. And I guess, subconsciously, I started to identify with that. Especially when\u2026well, you know.\n\nSo, it's not like I *chose* the name because I wanted to be all regal and goddess-like. It's just\u2026it grew on me. And now, it's just me. It's kinda weird, but it's also kinda cool.\n\nDon't read too much into it, okay? It's just a name. A slightly nerdy, mythology-inspired name. But it's mine. And I'm kinda okay with it.\n\nBesides, it's way better than Brenda. Seriously. Brenda is a terrible name.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark weren't exactly overflowing with joy when I told them. They were\u2026polite. Which is worse than being outright upset, you know? Polite means they were just trying to be good people, and not actually *wanting* this.\n\nSo when she said she was relieved to see the ultrasound photo, that it made it \u201creal\u201d and\u2026easier? It just felt like she was relieved it wasn\u2019t *her* problem anymore. Like, suddenly having proof of a tiny human was enough to make her okay with giving it up.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby, you know? It was about her life. Her plans. And I get that. I really do. But it still felt\u2026cold. Like I was just a vessel. A way to get something done.\n\nI tried to play it cool, obviously. I\u2019m good at that. I made a sarcastic comment about how she was probably relieved it didn\u2019t have her nose. But inside? I was just\u2026deflated.\n\nIt made me realize how much of this was about them, and not about the baby. And it made me even more determined to find good parents for it. Parents who would actually *want* it. Parents who would be excited about a tiny human with a weird nose.\n\nIt was a turning point, I guess. It made me stop trying to please them and start focusing on what was best for the baby. And for me. Because I deserved to feel okay about this too.\n\nUgh. Thinking about it still makes me feel weird. It\u2019s complicated. Everything with this whole situation is just\u2026complicated.", "Ugh. Vanessa's mom. Okay, that was\u2026a moment. A *very* long moment. It was like being cornered by a very well-dressed, very angry bear. Honestly, I think she was operating on pure adrenaline and a lifetime of wanting to control everything.\n\nI mostly just\u2026stood there. And tried not to make eye contact. Direct eye contact with a raging mom is never a good idea. It just escalates things.\n\nI think my first words were something along the lines of, \u201cWow, you\u2019re\u2026passionate.\u201d Which, in retrospect, was a terrible thing to say. It just made her more passionate.\n\nThen she started with the whole \u201cYou\u2019re a bad influence!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my daughter\u2019s life!\u201d routine. And I just kept repeating, \u201cI\u2019m not ruining anything. Vanessa made her own choices.\u201d Which, you know, is true. Vanessa is a pretty independent person. She just\u2026needed someone to talk to. And apparently, that someone was me.\n\nI think what finally diffused the situation \u2013 a little bit \u2013 was when I pointed out that she was yelling at a seventeen-year-old girl who was, you know, *pregnant*. Like, maybe she should be focusing her energy on supporting her daughter instead of giving me the third degree.\n\nIt was a gamble, but it worked. She kind of deflated after that. She still wasn\u2019t happy, obviously. But she stopped yelling. And eventually, she just\u2026left.\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. I needed a nap and a large pizza after that. And I definitely avoided Vanessa\u2019s house for a few days. It was just\u2026too much maternal intensity for one person to handle.\n\nBut hey, I survived. And Vanessa and I were still friends. So, I guess it was worth it. Even if it meant facing the wrath of Vanessa\u2019s mom. It builds character, right? Or something.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, obviously. It wasn't like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nFirst of all, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even close. I was still figuring out who *I* was.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were actually prepared, a good education, opportunities\u2026things I couldn't offer at the time. My mom was amazing, but she was already dealing with a lot. And my dad\u2026well, he was my dad.\n\nMark, the baby's dad, he was\u2026sweet, but he was going to college and trying to figure out his own life. We both knew we weren't ready to be parents.\n\nVanessa and Mark, the couple who adopted the baby\u2026they were perfect. They were so excited, so prepared, and they just radiated this\u2026warmth. They were exactly the kind of people I wanted raising my kid.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still kinda sucks, if I'm being honest. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby the best possible life.\n\nAnd honestly? It was about me getting to have a life, too. I needed to finish school, figure out what I wanted to do, and become a person before I could be a mom.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't pretty. But it was the right thing. And I stand by that. Even now.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna talk about the lab partner situation? Seriously? Fine. It's not my *favorite* topic.\n\nLook, I'm not saying I'm a *total* deadbeat. I just...prioritize things differently. Like, existential dread and avoiding eye contact with people I don't know. Those are pretty high on my list. Dissecting a frog? Not so much.\n\nIt's not that I don't *understand* the science. I do. I'm not stupid. It's just...the whole point seems kinda pointless, you know? Like, what are we even trying to prove? That frogs have internal organs? Groundbreaking.\n\nAnd honestly, I get distracted easily. I'm a thinker. My brain is constantly running a million miles an hour. So, yeah, I might be sketching band logos in my notebook instead of, like, meticulously labeling the frog's spleen. Sue me.\n\nPlus, I'm not a team player. I work best alone. I like to do things my own way. And I don't appreciate being told what to do, especially by someone who thinks a lab coat makes them a genius.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I'm a deadbeat lab partner. But I'm a *thoughtful* deadbeat lab partner. And I'm pretty sure my doodles are more interesting than whatever we were supposed to be learning about.\n\nDon't judge me. I'm just trying to survive high school. And sometimes, that means prioritizing my mental health over the reproductive system of an amphibian. It's a valid choice.", "Ugh. Seriously? Are we in middle school again? This is *exactly* the kind of drama I actively avoid. But fine, I'm stuck here, witnessing the fallout of\u2026whatever this is.\n\nOkay, so she's yelling about him not pulling his weight, and he's all, \"I was busy!\" and she's rolling her eyes so hard I'm worried they're gonna get stuck. It's\u2026painful.\n\nI'd probably just lean against the lab table, casually flipping through my notebook, and make a very pointed observation. Something like, \"Wow. Intense. You guys are really committed to failing this lab. It's\u2026inspiring, actually.\"\n\nAnd then, if they *dare* try to involve me, I'd hold up a hand and say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. I'm just here for the science, okay? Not the relationship counseling. I have a life, you know? And a baby to think about. Which, by the way, is way more important than who did what on the dissection.\"\n\nI'd probably give them both a withering look, and then add, \"Seriously, get it together. Or I'm just gonna finish the lab myself and you can both get zeros.\"\n\nBecause honestly, I don't have time for this. I've got bigger fish to fry. And by \"fish,\" I mean, like, existential crises and figuring out how to afford diapers. This lab drama is just\u2026noise.\n\nAnd if they *still* kept going, I'd just start loudly humming a really annoying song. Like, the Barney theme song. That usually shuts people up.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolls eyes) Okay, first of all, it's not \"hasty.\" It's\u2026considered. And it's not like I *want* to, okay? It's just\u2026a lot.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm a junior. I have college applications to worry about, and band practice, and trying to figure out what I even want to *do* with my life. I'm not exactly equipped to raise a human being right now.\n\nAnd it's not like I have a supportive, two-parent household waiting in the wings. My mom's great, but she's\u2026well, she's my mom. And my dad? He's\u2026around. Let's just leave it at that.\n\nPaul, he's\u2026sweet. But he's also sixteen. He's still figuring out how to tie his shoes, let alone be a father. \n\nSo, yeah, I'm considering all my options. And honestly, giving the baby up for adoption seems like the best thing for everyone involved. It's not what I *want*, but it's what I think is right. It means another family who really *wants* a baby gets a baby, and I get to\u2026finish high school and maybe go to college.\n\nIt's not a decision I'm taking lightly, okay? It's terrifying. It's sad. But it's also\u2026practical. And sometimes, practical is all you've got.\n\nAnd it's not \"hasty.\" I've been thinking about it for weeks. It's just\u2026not something I talk about a lot. It's kinda personal.\n\n\n\n(Looks away, fiddles with a strand of hair) Don't judge me, okay? It's my life.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want to know about my Boone's Farm preferences? This is getting personal. But fine, I'll indulge you.\n\nIt's not just *a* flavor, okay? It's Snow Peak Peach. And it's not about the taste, exactly. It's about the *vibe*.\n\nSee, all the other flavors are trying too hard. Strawberry Kiwi? Too sweet. Apple? Too\u2026basic. But Snow Peak Peach? It's subtle. It's understated. It's like the quiet kid in the back of the class who's secretly really smart.\n\nIt tastes like\u2026nostalgia, I guess. Like summer nights and bad decisions and trying to figure out your life. It's not sophisticated, it's not fancy, it's just\u2026real.\n\nAnd it's the perfect level of sugary sadness. You know? Like, it's sweet enough to distract you from everything that's going wrong, but not so sweet that it feels fake.\n\nPlus, it's pink. And pink is a good color. It's ironic and cheerful at the same time. Which is basically my whole aesthetic.\n\nSo yeah, Snow Peak Peach. Don't judge me. It's a complicated relationship. It's a comfort drink. It's a reminder that even when things are messy, there's still a little bit of sweetness to be found.\n\nAnd honestly, it pairs really well with a slice of pizza and a really good movie. Just saying.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking why everyone's kinda\u2026flustered about the whole baby thing? It's not exactly a surprise party, is it? Honestly, it's a lot of things.\n\nFirst of all, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! People have expectations about what a sixteen-year-old should be doing, and it doesn't usually involve impending motherhood. So there's that. Shock value, I guess.\n\nThen there's Paul. He's\u2026well, he's Paul. Sweet, kinda clueless, and definitely not ready to be a dad. He's running away from responsibility, which, okay, I get it. It's scary. But it doesn't make it any less awkward.\n\nAnd then there are my parents. They're trying to be supportive, which is nice, but they're also kinda freaking out. They're worried about my future, about the baby's future, about everything. They're good people, but they're\u2026overthinkers.\n\nAnd finally, there's the whole adoption thing. People don't really *get* that I'm choosing this. It's not a tragedy, it's a decision. I'm doing what I think is best for everyone involved, especially the baby. But it's hard to explain that to people who think I should be keeping it.\n\nSo yeah, it's a complicated situation. A lot of people have opinions, and a lot of them are conflicting. It's exhausting, honestly. But I'm trying to stay focused on what's important, and not let everyone else's drama get to me.\n\nIt's my life, my decision. And I'm gonna do what I gotta do. Even if everyone else is kinda weirded out about it.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026not a fun conversation. Bren, being Bren, was all concerned and motherly and generally just\u2026right. Which is annoying when you're trying to navigate a mess of your own making.\n\nI think I mostly just deflected. A lot of sarcasm. A lot of \"He's going through a thing!\" and \"It's complicated!\" which, let's be real, is the universal excuse for bad decisions.\n\nI remember saying something like, \"Look, he's a grown-up. He can make his own choices. And I'm not exactly forcing him to hang around.\" Which, in retrospect, was a really immature thing to say. But I was trying to make it sound like I wasn't the one causing trouble.\n\nThen I probably tried to turn it around on her, like, \"You're always saying I need to be independent and make my own decisions, so why are you suddenly judging me?\" Which was also a terrible thing to say. I was just being a defensive teenager.\n\nHonestly, I think I mostly just shut down. I didn't want to admit to myself, let alone to Bren, that I was maybe, possibly, making a really bad mistake. It was easier to pretend like everything was fine and that I had it all under control.\n\nShe didn't buy it, of course. Bren never buys anything. She just gave me that look. You know the one. The \"I'm disappointed in you but I still love you\" look. It's devastating.\n\nI think eventually I mumbled something about needing to think things through and then changed the subject. It wasn't my finest moment. But it was me, at the time. A mess of hormones and bad choices and a desperate need to feel\u2026something.\n\nIt took a while for me to actually *listen* to what she was saying. And even longer to actually *do* something about it. But Bren was right. She usually is.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing that up *now*? Okay, fine. Let's talk about the slushie.\n\nLook, it was a really weird day, okay? My dad and I were at Grandpa's memorial service, and it was just\u2026a lot. Everyone was being all sad and quiet and pretending to be super dignified. And I just\u2026couldn't. It felt fake.\n\nGrandpa wasn't a fake person. He was a goofball. He loved bad jokes and Hawaiian shirts and, honestly, probably would have appreciated a bright blue slushie being poured into his ashes.\n\nIt wasn't about disrespecting him. It was about\u2026honoring him, in my own way. It was about acknowledging that life is messy and weird and sometimes you just need to do something completely ridiculous to get through it.\n\nPlus, the urn was just *sitting* there. It was begging for a little color.\n\nI know it wasn't the most conventional way to say goodbye. But it felt right. It felt like Grandpa would have gotten a kick out of it. And honestly, it made me feel a little bit better.\n\nSo yeah, I poured my blue slushie into the urn. Don't judge me. It was a moment. A weird, slushie-filled moment. And I wouldn't change it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough *without* a little extra person growing inside you. It felt like everyone had an opinion, and suddenly I was dealing with stuff way beyond my years.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it was just\u2026trying to stay afloat. I leaned *hard* on my friends, especially Leah. She was a lifesaver. She didn't judge, she just\u2026listened. And made me laugh. A lot.\n\nPaul and Mark were\u2026complicated. They both stepped up in their own ways, but it was weird navigating that whole thing. It wasn't like a normal relationship, obviously. It was more like\u2026co-parenting before the parenting even started.\n\nI also spent a lot of time just\u2026observing. Watching my parents, watching Paul and Mark, watching other people with kids. Trying to figure out what it all meant. What kind of mom I wanted to be.\n\nAnd I wrote. A lot. In my notebook. It helped me sort through my feelings, even if it was just a bunch of rambling and sarcastic observations.\n\nIt was also really hard dealing with people's expectations. Everyone had an idea of what I should do, what I should feel. But I had to figure out what *I* wanted. And that took a lot of soul-searching.\n\nI think the biggest thing I learned was that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be scared and confused. And it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it made me grow up, like, a lot. And I think, in the end, it made me stronger. Even if I still don't know exactly what I'm doing half the time.\n\nIt's just\u2026life, you know? Messy and complicated and sometimes really scary. But also kinda beautiful. And worth fighting for.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026a lot. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense. Like, really eager. It was kinda awkward, honestly.\n\nHe was trying *so* hard to be cool, you know? Like, he'd try to use slang and talk about music he clearly didn't understand. It was endearing, in a pathetic sort of way. He kept calling me \"Juno-bean,\" which was\u2026a choice. A bad choice. I told him to stop, like, five times.\n\nHe and Vanessa were\u2026different. She was quiet and reserved, and he was, well, Mark. He'd ask me a million questions about my life, my music, my future. It felt like an interview sometimes, not a casual hang-out.\n\nHe kept trying to bond over music, which was hilarious. He was all, \"Oh, you like The Moldy Peaches? I *love* The Moldy Peaches!\" And then he'd try to sing along and completely butcher the lyrics. It was painful.\n\nBut, like, underneath all the awkwardness, he was genuinely a good guy. He really wanted a kid. And he and Vanessa seemed like they'd be good parents. They were just\u2026a little bit clueless about teenagers.\n\nI think he was trying to prove he could be a fun dad, and it just came off as\u2026trying too hard. It was like he was auditioning for the role.\n\nIt wasn't *bad*, it was just\u2026weird. And a little bit exhausting. I mean, I appreciate the effort, but sometimes you just want someone to chill, you know? Not interrogate you about your favorite color and try to relate to you through questionable musical taste.\n\nHe did make a really good grilled cheese, though. I'll give him that.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Bleeker. That kid. Honestly. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like, a *bad* comment, exactly. It was just\u2026Bleeker being Bleeker. All awkward and earnest and trying to be supportive, but completely missing the point. He was trying to be sweet, I guess, saying something about how I was \"really showing\" and how it was \"cool\" to see the baby growing.\n\nAnd I just\u2026froze.\n\nIt wasn't the comment itself, it was the *timing*. We were at the arcade, right? And I was trying to pretend everything was normal, like I hadn't just decided to give my baby up for adoption. Like I wasn't a walking, talking emotional mess. And he just\u2026pointed it out. Like it was some kind of accomplishment.\n\nIt just reminded me, in that moment, that this wasn't about *us*. It was about the baby. And about me making a really hard decision. And about how my body was changing in ways I wasn't entirely comfortable with.\n\nI think I just mumbled something about needing another turn on Dance Dance Revolution and walked away. I didn't want to deal with it. I didn't want to explain it. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nIt wasn't that I was mad at Bleeker. He's a good kid. He just\u2026doesn't always get it. And sometimes, you just need people to *not* get it, you know? You just need them to let you be.\n\nIt was just\u2026a moment. A small moment, but a really loaded one. It just made everything feel a little bit more real, and a little bit more scary. And a little bit more lonely.\n\nUgh. Thinking about it still makes me cringe. Seriously. Don't remind me.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me get all\u2026emotional. It's not my strong suit. But you asked.\n\nThe hardest part? It wasn't the physical stuff, you know? Like, morning sickness or cravings or even the actual labor. That was all\u2026manageable. It was the *knowing*. Knowing that I was growing a person, and that I wasn't going to get to keep them.\n\nIt sounds kinda selfish, I guess. But it's not about wanting to keep a baby, it's about wanting to be a mom. And realizing that I wasn't ready, that I *couldn't* be the mom this baby deserved\u2026that was brutal.\n\nEvery kick, every little flutter, it was a reminder. A reminder that I was falling in love with someone I was going to have to say goodbye to. And it wasn't like a breakup, where you can just block their number. This was\u2026permanent.\n\nAnd the guilt. Oh, the guilt. Wondering if I was doing the right thing. Wondering if I was hurting the baby. Wondering if Mark and Vanessa were really the right people. It's a lot of wondering.\n\nPeople kept saying I was brave, or selfless. But it didn't *feel* brave. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. And it still kinda does, sometimes.\n\nIt's not something you just \"get over.\" It's something you learn to live with. And it's something that changes you. It makes you think about things differently. It makes you appreciate what you have.\n\nSo yeah. The knowing. That was the hardest part. Knowing that I was doing what was best for the baby, even though it was the hardest thing I'd ever done. And hoping, really hoping, that they'd be okay.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. He was\u2026intense. And smelled faintly of mothballs.\n\nHe had this whole spiel about how babies are \"tiny humans\" and \"gifts from God\" and how abortion is \"murder.\" It was all very dramatic and, frankly, a little bit creepy. He kept holding up these pictures of, like, really cute babies, which was just\u2026manipulative.\n\nHe kept yelling about how every baby deserves a chance at life, and how we were all \"killing innocent souls.\" It was a lot. And super unhelpful. Like, I was already dealing with a lot, okay? I didn't need some random dude guilt-tripping me about my life choices.\n\nHe didn't seem to understand that it wasn't about *not* wanting a baby, it was about wanting a baby to have a good life. A life I couldn't give it right now. It wasn't about being pro-choice because I wanted to get rid of something, it was about being pro-life for the baby *and* for myself.\n\nHonestly, he just made the whole situation a lot more stressful. And he didn't seem to realize that yelling at people isn't exactly a persuasive tactic. It just makes you look like a jerk.\n\nIt was just\u2026ugh. It was a bad day all around.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive this. It's\u2026a memory. A not-great one.\n\nSo, I was at the clinic, right? Planned Parenthood. It wasn't exactly a party atmosphere. Lots of quiet people, trying not to make eye contact. And this woman\u2026she was older. Probably in her late 40s, maybe early 50s. She was sitting in the waiting room, knitting. Like, seriously, knitting. It felt\u2026old-fashioned.\n\nShe looked at me, and I tried to look back like I wasn't totally freaking out inside. And she just\u2026smiled. A sad kind of smile. And she said, and I remember this *exactly*, she said, \"You're very brave.\"\n\nBrave? Me? I was anything *but* brave. I was terrified. I was a mess. I was trying not to throw up in the waiting room. But she didn't know any of that. She just saw a girl, probably around my age, making a really hard decision.\n\nAnd she didn't judge. She didn't preach. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just\u2026acknowledged how hard it was. And that little bit of kindness, honestly, it meant a lot. It was like, a tiny little life raft in a sea of anxiety.\n\nShe didn't say anything else. Just smiled and went back to her knitting. I never saw her again. But I think about her sometimes. And I hope she's okay.\n\nIt was just\u2026a moment. But it stuck with me. It reminded me that I wasn't alone. And that sometimes, all you need is a little bit of understanding. Even from a stranger with knitting needles.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Su-Chin. She's\u2026intense. And she has this way of looking at you like you're a science experiment.\n\nSo, yeah, I mentioned Adderall. It just kinda slipped out, you know? We were talking about school and how everyone was, like, super focused on getting into college, and I was just being honest about how some people were using it to, like, pull all-nighters. Not that *I* was, obviously. Just observing.\n\nAnd her face. Oh. My. God. It was like someone had just told her the Earth was flat. Her eyes got all wide and she stopped stirring her hot chocolate. It was super awkward.\n\nShe didn't yell or anything, which was good, I guess. But she launched into this whole lecture about the dangers of stimulants and how it's cheating and how it's messing with your brain chemistry. It was a lot.\n\nAnd then she started asking me really specific questions. Like, \"Do you know anyone who takes it?\" and \"Have you ever been tempted?\" and \"What are your thoughts on the ethical implications of cognitive enhancement?\" Seriously? Ethical implications? I was just trying to make a casual observation!\n\nShe kept saying it was a \"serious issue\" and that I should be more aware of the consequences. It was like I'd confessed to robbing a bank.\n\nHonestly, I think she was more freaked out that I even *knew* about it than anything else. She's very\u2026by-the-book. And Adderall is definitely not in the rulebook.\n\nShe eventually calmed down, but she kept giving me these little side-eyes for the rest of the afternoon. It was super weird. I think she thought I was secretly a drug dealer or something.\n\nIt just proves my point, though. People overreact about everything. It's exhausting.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *ask*. Seriously. It was\u2026a whole vibe in that waiting room. Not a good vibe. It wasn't, like, jump-scare terrifying, it was\u2026existential terrifying.\n\nIt wasn't the pamphlets, okay? Those were just\u2026sad. Pictures of babies and stuff. Too much. Too soon.\n\nIt was the *people*. Specifically, the couples. All beaming at each other, holding hands, talking about names and nurseries. Like, seriously? You guys are already picking out wallpaper? I hadn't even processed that I was, like, *pregnant* yet, and they were planning a whole life.\n\nAnd they were all\u2026perfect. Like, perfectly happy, perfectly put-together, perfectly\u2026ready. And I was just sitting there, trying not to throw up, wearing a band t-shirt and looking like I hadn't slept in a week.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. And really, really alone. Like I was the only one who was completely freaked out and didn't have a clue what I was doing.\n\nAnd then there was this one woman, she was just\u2026staring. Not at me, exactly, but *through* me. Like she knew something I didn't. Like she knew how much my life was about to change. And her eyes were just\u2026empty.\n\nThat was the worst part. The emptiness. It made me feel like everything was pointless. Like I was just a cog in some giant baby-making machine.\n\nSo yeah, that's what terrified me. Not the possibility of needles or ultrasounds or anything like that. It was the realization that my life was about to be completely different, and I had no idea if I was ready for it.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it gives me the creeps. Can we talk about something else now? Like, music? Or tater tots? Anything but babies.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? You're bringing up Bleeker? It's been\u2026a while. And honestly, it's complicated.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026sweet. Really sweet. And kinda adorably clueless. He was a good guy. A really good guy. And he definitely got me through a lot. Like, the whole pregnancy thing, and figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. He was always just\u2026there.\n\nDo I still have *feelings* for him? That's a tough one. It's not like a burning, can't-live-without-him kind of thing anymore. That was\u2026a teenage thing. A moment in time.\n\nBut there's definitely a fondness. A warmth. He's one of those people you just always care about, you know? Like a really good friend. Someone you can always count on.\n\nI think I realized that what I wanted wasn't necessarily a boyfriend, but someone who just *got* me. And Bleeker got me, in his own quiet, musical way. But we were both kinda figuring things out, and I think we needed to do that separately.\n\nSo, no, I don't think I'm *in love* with Bleeker anymore. But I definitely still care about him. And I hope he's doing okay. He's a good egg.\n\nCan we talk about something else now? This is getting weirdly sentimental. I have a life to live, you know? And it doesn't involve obsessing over high school crushes. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me *started* on Vanessa's decorating choices. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...not what I would have pictured. At all.\n\nShe's going full-on woodland creatures. Like, every surface is covered in owls and foxes and little deer wearing hats. It's cute, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing. But it feels\u2026overwhelming. Like the baby's going to be raised by a committee of stuffed animals.\n\nAnd the color scheme? Everything is beige and brown and muted green. It's supposed to be \"calming,\" she says. But it just looks\u2026sad. Like a beige cave. I was hoping for something a little more\u2026vibrant. Maybe a little less\u2026taxidermy-chic.\n\nI tried to suggest a few things, like maybe a cool mobile or some interesting artwork, but she just smiled and said, \"Oh, honey, I've got it covered.\" Which basically means, \"Don't even bother.\"\n\nLook, I appreciate that she's excited about the baby. And I know she wants to create a perfect nursery. But it's a little much. It's like she's trying to create a whole *world* for the baby, and I'm just hoping the baby doesn't get lost in all the woodland creatures.\n\nI'm just gonna try to stay out of it. It's her baby, her room. I'll just bring a really cool, ironic gift. Maybe a tiny leather jacket for the baby. That'll throw off the whole aesthetic. It's the least I can do.", "Ugh. Nesting. Okay, so everyone keeps talking about \"nesting.\" Like, suddenly I'm supposed to have this primal urge to rearrange furniture and color-coordinate tiny socks? It's\u2026weird.\n\nHonestly, it feels kinda fake. Like, I'm not a bird. I don't need to build a perfectly crafted nest to feel secure. And the whole baby room thing? It's a lot. People get *intense* about baby rooms. It's like, it has to be a Pinterest-worthy paradise or the baby will be traumatized for life.\n\nPaul and Annie are really into it, which is sweet, I guess. They're picking out paint colors and assembling furniture and it's\u2026a lot of beige. Seriously, beige? It's a baby, not a corporate office.\n\nI'm trying to be supportive, but I mostly just feel overwhelmed. It's like, I'm already dealing with a lot of feelings about this whole situation, and now I have to worry about whether the crib is the right shade of off-white? It's exhausting.\n\nI think I'm more focused on, like, making sure the baby has a safe and loving home, you know? Not necessarily a perfectly decorated one. A comfy blanket and a few toys are good enough for me. \n\nIt's not that I don't care. It's just\u2026I'm not wired for all the fuss. I'm more of a \"wing it\" kind of person. And honestly, I'm kinda scared that if I get too invested in the baby room, it'll make everything feel more real. And that's\u2026terrifying.\n\nSo yeah, nesting. It's a thing. I'm trying to participate, but mostly I'm just trying not to freak out. And maybe suggest a little less beige.", "Ugh. Don't even get me *started* on the mall. It was\u2026a whole other planet. Like, I stepped into a different dimension where everything smells like vanilla and desperation.\n\nThose women\u2026 seriously. The ones with the perfectly coiffed hair and the designer handbags? It was like watching a pack of wolves circling a sale rack. They were *intense*. And the way they talked to the sales associates? Like they were personally responsible for the lack of their size.\n\nIt was just\u2026so much. So much stuff, so much money, so much *need*. Like, do they even *like* the clothes, or are they just buying them to prove something? To each other? To themselves? It's exhausting just thinking about it.\n\nAnd the kids! Don't even get me started on the kids. Little mini-versions of their mothers, already learning the art of consumerism. It's kinda sad, actually.\n\nI mean, I get wanting to look nice. I do. But it felt\u2026empty. Like they were trying to fill a hole with a new pair of shoes. And honestly? I'd rather spend my money on a good mix CD and a giant bag of cheese puffs. At least that's honest enjoyment.\n\nIt just made me feel\u2026weirdly grateful for my life. For my friends, for my family, for the fact that I don't need a $500 handbag to feel good about myself.\n\nIt was a good reminder that people are complicated. And that sometimes, the people who seem to have it all together are the ones who are the most lost.\n\nSeriously. The mall. It's a scary place.", "Ugh. Okay, so, motherhood. It's\u2026a lot. It's not what I expected, not even close. I mean, I knew it was gonna be a big deal, obviously. But it's like, exponentially bigger than I imagined.\n\nIt's not just about, like, having a tiny human who needs you to feed it and change its diaper. It's about having this little person who is completely dependent on you for *everything*. And that's\u2026terrifying. And amazing. And exhausting. All at the same time.\n\nThe changes? They're huge. My body is, like, totally different. My priorities are different. I can't just spontaneously decide to go to a concert or hang out with my friends whenever I want. Everything has to be planned around this little person.\n\nAnd the responsibilities? Don't even get me started. It's not just about keeping this kid alive. It's about raising them to be a good person. Teaching them about the world. Protecting them from all the bad stuff. It's a lot of pressure.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I feel completely overwhelmed. Like I have no idea what I'm doing. And I miss my old life sometimes. I miss being able to just\u2026be.\n\nBut then this kid smiles at me, or does something cute, or just looks at me with those big, trusting eyes, and it all feels worth it. It's like, this little person is the most important thing in the world. And I would do anything for them.\n\nIt's scary, yeah. But it's also\u2026good. It's a different kind of good than I've ever felt before. It's a deeper, more meaningful kind of good.\n\nI'm still figuring it out, you know? I'm still learning. But I'm trying to be the best mom I can be. And I think, maybe, I'm doing okay.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. A really, really lot. And I'm gonna need a lot of coffee to get through it.", "Ugh, okay, you want to get into the messy stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't been thinking about it enough already.\n\nIt's not about finding the *perfect* parents, because let's be real, those don't exist. It's about finding parents who...get it. Who aren't gonna try to mold the kid into something they're not.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa Loring, they're...different. They're not, like, super-traditional. They're kinda quirky, and they already have a kid, but they're not all about soccer practice and piano lessons and perfect grades. They want a kid to *be* something, not *do* something, you know?\n\nMy parents...they're good people, but they have a very specific idea of what my life should look like. College, career, husband, house, the whole shebang. And I'm just...not sure that's for me. I don't want my kid to feel pressured to follow a path they don't want to.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they seem like they'd let the kid be whoever they want to be. A musician, an artist, a professional skateboarder, I don't know. As long as they're happy.\n\nIt's not about judging other people's lifestyles. It's about wanting my kid to have the freedom to choose their own. And I think Mark and Vanessa would give them that.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple decision. But I want the best for this kid, and I think they'd be really happy with Mark and Vanessa. They just...feel right.\n\nAnd honestly? It's a little bit about wanting someone who will understand that sometimes, life doesn't go according to plan. And that's okay.", "Ugh. Okay, so, hypothetically speaking, if I decided to\u2026keep the baby. Which, like, I haven\u2019t decided anything yet, okay? Just thinking out loud. But if I did\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be all sunshine and rainbows, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nFirst off, school. Seriously. I\u2019m a junior. I\u2019m supposed to be thinking about colleges and SATs and, like, figuring out my life. A baby kinda throws a wrench in those plans. I\u2019d probably have to drop out, or at least take a really long break. And then what?\n\nThen there\u2019s the money thing. My dad\u2019s a construction worker, and my stepmom\u2019s a realtor. They\u2019re good people, but they\u2019re not exactly rolling in dough. I don\u2019t want to be a burden. I\u2019d have to get a job, which means less time for, well, everything. And daycare is expensive. Like, ridiculously expensive.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the whole\u2026growing up thing. I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m still figuring out who *I* am. I\u2019m not exactly ready to be a mom. I mean, I can barely keep my room clean, let alone raise a human being.\n\nAnd Paul? He\u2019s\u2026Paul. He\u2019s a good guy, but he\u2019s not exactly equipped to be a dad either. We\u2019re both still kids, basically.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the judgment. People talking. Whispering. Judging. I\u2019m already kind of an outsider, and this would just make it worse.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think I could *love* the baby. I know I could. It\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s a huge responsibility. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for it. It would change my life completely. And I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m willing to give up my life, not yet anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026a lot to think about. A *lot*. And it\u2019s not a decision I can take lightly. It\u2019s not like returning a sweater. This is a person. A whole entire person. And that\u2019s\u2026scary.\n\n\n\nSo yeah. Those are some of the things. It\u2019s not a simple situation, okay? Don\u2019t judge me for even considering it. It\u2019s complicated.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She meant well, she really did. But sometimes her ideas are\u2026a lot. When I told her I was thinking about adoption, she got this look on her face, like I'd just announced I was joining the circus.\n\nShe immediately started going on about how we could, like, *co-parent*. With Mark. Which, honestly, was the last thing I wanted to hear. Like, imagine me, a seventeen-year-old, trying to raise a baby with the guy who can barely remember to bring his own lunch to school. It was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nShe kept saying how we could make it work, how Mark's parents had a big house, and how we could all be a \"family.\" She even started picturing Christmas mornings and soccer practice. It was\u2026intense.\n\nShe also suggested, and this was the really out-there one, that I could just\u2026keep the baby and finish high school. Like it was no big deal. Like I could just magically balance algebra, band practice, and a newborn. Seriously? She was living in a fantasy world.\n\nIt was a lot to process, and it just made me even more sure that adoption was the right choice. It wasn't what *I* wanted, but it was the best thing for the baby. And honestly, it was probably the best thing for me and Mark too. We were kids. We weren't ready. Leah just\u2026didn't quite get that.", "Ugh. Okay, look. That was\u2026not my finest moment. And I get why people would be, like, rightfully annoyed with me. It wasn't cool.\n\nIt's just\u2026I was feeling really awkward and overwhelmed, okay? I was pregnant, and everything was changing, and I was trying to act like I wasn't terrified. And those women\u2026they were just so\u2026*intense* about their kids. Like, helicopter parenting to the extreme. And I was just trying to deflect, to make myself feel better by making them the butt of the joke.\n\nIt was a defense mechanism. A really bad one. I know that.\n\nI didn't mean to be mean. I just\u2026I was scared and insecure and trying to cope in the only way I knew how at the time, which was with sarcasm and a whole lot of attitude.\n\nI'm not proud of it. And I definitely learned a lesson. It's not okay to make fun of people, especially when they're just trying to be good parents.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do. And I apologized to Paul later. He was right to call me out on it. He always is.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I just say things without thinking. It's a flaw. I'm working on it. But yeah, that was a moment I'd rather forget. It just\u2026happened. And I regret it.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was\u2026complicated.

I hadn't really processed any of it yet, you know? The whole baby thing. It was still just\u2026this weird lump inside me.\n\nShe was just\u2026excited. And I didn't have the energy to be rude. I was already dealing with my dad and Paul and everything else. I just kind of froze. And she just\u2026went for it.\n\nIt wasn't like I *wanted* her to touch my belly. It was more like I didn't have the strength to say no. I was being polite. A really, really bad polite.\n\nAnd honestly, it was kind of weird. Like, she didn't even ask. She just assumed. It was a total Vanessa move.\n\nI definitely regretted it afterwards. It felt\u2026invasive. But I didn't say anything. I just kind of smiled weakly and tried to change the subject.\n\nIt's not something I think about a lot, but yeah. It happened. And it was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of tater tots? Or maybe the existential dread of being a teenager? Anything but Vanessa's hands on my stomach. Please.", "Ugh, seriously? It's like, people suddenly develop a sense of spatial awareness when they see me waddling down the street. It's\u2026weird. And kinda insulting, honestly. Like, I'm a walking obstacle course or something.\n\nIt's the belly, obviously. It's not exactly subtle. I'm carrying a whole human being in there, so yeah, I take up a little more room. But it doesn't mean I disappear or something.\n\nI think people just\u2026panic. They see the bump and they're all, \"Oh my god, pregnant lady! Must give her a wide berth! Don't want to accidentally bump into her and cause a medical emergency!\" It's like I'm suddenly fragile or something.\n\nAnd then there's the whole \"aww\" factor. They see the belly and they get all soft and sentimental and just\u2026move out of the way. It's like I'm a walking, talking baby magnet.\n\nIt's not that I *want* people to give me space, it's just\u2026they do. It's a weird perk of being pregnant, I guess.

They've got the house, the careers, the dog\u2026they're ready. That's the problem. They're *ready*. Like they've been planning this for years.

Like a new appliance.\n\nMark and Vanessa are lovely, but they're kinda\u2026beige. They don't have a lot of edges. And babies need edges. They need messiness. They need someone who's gonna let them be a little bit weird and imperfect.\n\nPaul and Annie, they're\u2026messy. They're real. They're not pretending to have their lives together. They're just trying to figure it out, like I am. And I think that's a better environment for a kid.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's not logical. It's just\u2026a feeling. I want this baby to go to a home where it's gonna be loved unconditionally, even when it's being a total pain in the butt.

A little\u2026intense. Very into Pottery Barn and having a perfect life. It's kinda exhausting just being around that energy. She means well, I think, but she's got this way of making everything about her and Mark.\n\nAnd Mark? Oh, Mark. He's\u2026a project. A very earnest, very clueless project. He tries so hard to be cool and relatable, but it just comes off as awkward. He's got a good heart, I'll give him that. But he's also kinda clueless about, like, actual life. He's always trying to impress people, and it's just\u2026sad.\n\nThey're a couple who are *really* trying to be a couple, you know? Like, they're performing coupledom. It's a little weird. They're so focused on presenting this perfect image that I don't think they actually *see* each other.\n\nI feel bad for them, honestly. They seem so\u2026lost. Like they're trying to fill a void with stuff and appearances. It's kinda pathetic.\n\nBut I also don't want to get involved. They're adults. They can figure their own stuff out. I've got enough on my plate, okay? I'm dealing with a baby and a future and all that jazz. I don't need to be their therapist.\n\nSo yeah. They're\u2026there. They're a part of the whole equation.

It's not like she just woke up one day and decided I was the enemy. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nI think a lot of it is just that I'm\u2026me. I'm not exactly what she pictured for her son, you know? I'm not a cheerleader or a debutante or whatever she was expecting. I'm kinda sarcastic and I say what's on my mind and I don't really care about fitting in. And I'm pregnant. Which, let's be real, doesn't exactly scream \"ideal wife material.\"\n\nShe's also really into Paul. Like, *really* into Paul.

It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture moment, okay? It was more\u2026awkward. And kinda sad.\n\nI mean, I was avoiding him, right? After\u2026everything.

I figured, what's the worst that could happen? It's just music.\n\nAnd it wasn't just *music*. It was\u2026him. Every song, every lyric, it felt like he was talking directly to me. It was kinda creepy, but also\u2026sweet. He actually *listened* to me, you know? He remembered all the stuff I said I liked.\n\nIt wasn't about falling for him or anything. It was about realizing that he was a good person. And that maybe, just maybe, he understood me better than anyone else.\n\nIt was a stupid CD, really. But it was a turning point. It made me realize that I wasn't as tough and independent as I thought I was. And that it was okay to need someone.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I listened to it. Because I was lonely, and because I was curious, and because it was a really good mix. Don't tell anyone I said that last part. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start*. Eight months. Seriously? It feels\u2026weird. Like, I'm carrying around a whole person. A tiny, kicking, occasionally-punching person. It's a lot.\n\nIt's not exactly glamorous, let me tell you. My feet are swollen, I'm constantly tired, and I have cravings for the most bizarre things. Pickles and peanut butter? Don't judge me.\n\nAnd it's just\u2026heavy. Like, physically heavy. And emotionally heavy. I mean, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. Giving a baby up for adoption was always the plan, but now that it's actually happening\u2026it's different.\n\nIt's not sadness, exactly. It's more like\u2026a weird mix of anticipation and anxiety and a little bit of grief. I'm excited for the baby to have a good life with Mark and Vanessa, but it's also hard to let go.\n\nPaul's been really good, though. He's been super supportive and patient, even when I'm being a total grump. And my dad\u2026well, he's trying. He keeps offering me weird health advice and making awkward small talk. It's endearing, in a way.\n\nHonestly, it's just\u2026a lot. I'm trying to focus on the positive, on the fact that this baby is going to be loved and cared for. But it's also okay to admit that it's scary and confusing and overwhelming.\n\nSo yeah, eight months pregnant. It's\u2026an experience. A really, really weird experience. And I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. And maybe eat another pickle. Don't tell anyone.", "Ugh, seriously? This again? It's a thing, okay? Like, I can be walking down the street, minding my own business, and people just\u2026*stare*. It's super annoying.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. First of all, I'm not exactly blending in. I mean, I have opinions. And I'm not afraid to share them. And I dress how *I* want to dress, not how other people think I should. So, yeah, I stand out.\n\nAnd then there's the whole\u2026situation. You know. The baby thing. People are curious. They want to know the story. They want to judge. It's rude, but it happens.\n\nI think some people are just surprised that someone my age can be, like, actually articulate. Like they expect me to just say \"like\" every other word and be obsessed with, I don't know, boy bands or something.\n\nAnd honestly? I think some people are just nosy. They like to look at other people and make assumptions. It's a human thing, I guess.\n\nWhatever the reason, it's irritating. I just wish people would mind their own business. It's not like I'm walking around with a sign that says \"Ask me about my life!\"\n\nI usually just stare back. It makes them uncomfortable. And then they look away. It's a good system.\n\nBut yeah, people stare. It's just\u2026part of being me, I guess. A slightly awkward, perpetually observed part of being me.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A *bold* choice.\n\nLook, I'm happy for Bleek, I guess. He deserves to have someone to go to prom with. He's a good kid, even if he's kinda\u2026intense about his music. And Katrina's\u2026well, Katrina's Katrina. She's got a lot of energy. A *lot*.\n\nBut it's just\u2026weird. They're so different. It's like pairing a quiet indie film with a really loud pop song. It could be amazing, or it could be a total disaster.\n\nI mean, Katrina's all about the cheerleading and the popularity contest, and Bleek's over there composing symphonies in his basement. It's a clash of worlds, you know?\n\nI'm not saying they shouldn't go. If they're happy, then good for them. But I'm just picturing the prom photos now, and it's\u2026a lot. A lot of awkwardness. A lot of forced smiles.\n\nHonestly, I'm more worried about Bleek getting overwhelmed. Katrina can be a bit much. He needs someone who appreciates his quiet intensity, not someone who's going to try and turn him into a party animal.\n\nBut hey, maybe they'll surprise me. Maybe they'll have the time of their lives. Maybe they'll fall madly in love. Who knows? Life is weird.\n\nJust\u2026don't ask me to be their chaperone. I have enough drama in my own life, thank you very much.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Like, existential crisis deep. Honestly? Before all this happened, I thought I had things pretty figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, knew exactly what I thought about everything. Turns out, I was mostly just\u2026avoiding stuff.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing has been like a giant, messy, glitter-covered mirror shoved in my face. And I haven't always liked what I've seen.\n\nI learned I'm way more scared than I thought I was. Not just about the baby, but about\u2026everything. About growing up, about responsibility, about not being able to just drift through life anymore.\n\nI also learned I'm stronger than I thought. Like, seriously. Dealing with all this, with my parents, with Paul, with Annie and Mark\u2026it's been exhausting. But I haven't fallen apart. Not yet, anyway.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to think needing help was a sign of weakness. Now I realize it's just\u2026being human. It's okay to lean on people. It's okay to admit you don't have all the answers.\n\nI also learned that I actually *care* about something more than just myself. Which is kinda terrifying, but also\u2026good. This baby, even though I'm giving it up, it's made me think about the future in a way I never have before.\n\nI guess what I've learned is that I'm not as cynical as I pretend to be. And that maybe, just maybe, I'm capable of being a good person. Even if I'm still figuring out what that means.\n\nIt's still messy, and I'm still scared, but I'm also\u2026okay. I think. It's a work in progress. A really, really messy work in progress. But I'm getting there. Slowly.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Bleeker and Katrina? It's just\u2026a mess. And it's not even a *cute* mess, you know? It's the kind of mess that makes you want to roll your eyes so hard they get stuck.\n\nLook, Katrina's a good person. She's\u2026intense, yeah, and maybe a little bit much sometimes, but she's got a good heart. And she's clearly into Bleeker. Like, *really* into him. And he's just\u2026flirting with her to make Paul jealous.\n\nIt's manipulative, okay? It's just a really immature way to deal with his feelings for me. Like, if you're having issues with someone, you talk to them. You don't use another person as a pawn. It's just\u2026gross.\n\nAnd Katrina doesn't deserve that. She deserves someone who actually appreciates her, not someone who's just using her to get a reaction out of someone else. \n\nI mean, I get that Bleeker's a little clueless sometimes. He's a sweet kid, but he's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. But that doesn't excuse his behavior. He needs to grow up and learn how to handle his emotions like a normal person.\n\nIt just bugs me, okay? Seeing someone get hurt like that. It reminds me of all the dumb stuff I used to do before I got pregnant. And I don't want anyone else to go through that. It's just\u2026not cool.\n\nSo yeah, I'm concerned. And I'm probably going to say something to Bleeker about it, even if he doesn't want to hear it. Because sometimes, you just have to tell people when they're being jerks. Even if they're your friends.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so like, when you're a freshman, sophomore, it seems\u2026okay. It's something to look forward to, right? The dresses, the dancing, the awkward slow dances with guys you kinda like. It's all very\u2026movie-esque.\n\nBut then you actually get to be a senior. And suddenly, it's just\u2026weird. It's like everyone's trying *so* hard to have this perfect, magical night, and it just feels forced. Like a really expensive, over-decorated middle school dance.\n\nAnd everyone's all stressed about dates and dresses and who's going with who. It's a whole social hierarchy thing, and honestly, I'm over it. I'd rather just hang out with my friends and not worry about impressing anyone.\n\nPlus, it's expensive! Dresses, tickets, hair, makeup\u2026it all adds up. You could spend that money on, like, a really good record collection or a trip somewhere.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like everyone's pretending to be something they're not. Like they're trying to live up to some unrealistic expectation of what prom \"should\" be. And I'm just not into that.\n\nI think once you're old enough to realize how ridiculous it all is, it just loses its appeal. It's like, you've outgrown it. It's time to move on to bigger and better things. Like, figuring out your life and stuff. Which is way more terrifying, but also way more real.\n\nSo yeah. Prom. Not cool. Once you're old enough to know better. It's just\u2026a thing.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. Even though it happened a while ago. It's not like it's a story I *love* telling, but I get why you'd ask. It was a big decision. The biggest, probably.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot of thinking. A lot of crying. A lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa.\n\nI was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted for the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my school, my music\u2026everything.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. That's what people didn't get. I *wanted* the baby. But wanting something and being able to *give* it everything it needs are two different things.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were perfect. They were already planning a family, they had a beautiful home, they were stable and loving. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't. A life with two parents who were ready and excited.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye\u2026it felt like my heart was being ripped out. But I knew it was the right thing. For the baby. For me. For everyone.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about making a choice. A really hard choice. A selfless choice. And I still think about it sometimes. Wondering how things would be different if I'd made a different decision. But I don't regret it. Not really.\n\nIt taught me a lot about myself. About responsibility. About love. About letting go. And it made me realize that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is admit you can't do something alone.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. For everyone involved. And that's all that really matters, right?", "Ugh, okay, so Dad being Dad. It's\u2026sweet, I guess. And annoying. Mostly annoying. Like, he's all worried about me getting \"ripped off,\" like I'm some kind of idiot who can't tell a good person from a bad one. Which, honestly, is kinda insulting.\n\nI get *why* he's worried. He loves me, and he wants what's best for the baby. And for me. But he's picturing some creepy, weirdo couple who are gonna lock the baby in a basement or something. It's dramatic. He always goes dramatic.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa? They're\u2026nice. Really nice. They're a little\u2026perfect, maybe. Like, they have a matching sweater collection. But they're genuinely excited about having a kid, and they seem like they'd be good parents. \n\nIt's just\u2026he doesn't *get* it. He thinks I'm doing this because I'm irresponsible or something. Which, okay, maybe I am a little bit. But I've thought this through. A lot. And I want this baby to have a good life. A better life than I can give it right now.\n\nAnd I need him to trust my judgment. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm making a really hard decision, and I need his support, not his skepticism. \n\nSo yeah, it's frustrating. It's like, I appreciate his concern, but I also need him to back off a little. I can handle this. I'm stronger than he thinks. And I'm definitely smarter than he gives me credit for.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Dads. They always think they know best.", "Ugh. Seriously? *That's* what he goes with? After everything? It's just\u2026classic Dad. Always with the subtle digs disguised as \"concern.\" Like I'm some kind of bottomless pit of bad decisions.\n\nIt's not like I *want* to be in this situation, okay? It's not like I planned to get pregnant. It just\u2026happened. And I'm dealing with it. I'm making a choice. A really hard choice. And he's acting like I'm ordering a second helping of dessert when I should be thinking about my future.\n\n\"Not knowing when to say when.\" It's so condescending. It implies I'm impulsive and irresponsible. Which, okay, maybe I am sometimes. But I'm also trying to be a grown-up. And grown-ups make difficult choices.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. He thinks he's being helpful, but he's just making me feel worse. Like I'm failing him somehow. Like I'm not living up to his expectations.\n\nI just want him to be supportive. I want him to understand that this isn't about me being reckless. It's about me trying to do what's best for everyone involved.\n\nBut whatever. He's my dad. He'll never really get it. He's always going to see me as his little girl, even when I'm making life-altering decisions.\n\nI just need to tune him out and focus on what *I* need to do. And maybe eat a Pop-Tart. Because sometimes, a Pop-Tart is exactly what you need when your dad is being a pain.", "Ugh, Loring. Seriously? It's\u2026a lot. It's like, Stepford Wives meets Architectural Digest. It's all perfectly manicured lawns and houses that look like they belong in a magazine. And everyone pretends to be *so* happy. It's creepy.\n\nIt's not that I have something against nice houses, okay? It's just\u2026it feels fake. Like, people are trying too hard. And the gate? The *gate* is the worst part. It's like they're trying to keep something *out*, but really, they're just keeping themselves isolated.\n\nIt's just\u2026not real life. It's not messy and complicated and full of weirdos like the rest of the world. It's all beige and polite smiles and pretending everything is perfect. And I'm just\u2026not a beige kind of person.\n\nPaul's parents seem to think it's the pinnacle of achievement, you know? Like, finally making it to Loring means you've *arrived*. But I'm not sure what you're arriving *to*. A whole lot of pressure to keep up appearances?\n\nIt's just\u2026suffocating. I can visit, I can be polite, but I don't think I could ever actually *live* there. I need a little bit of chaos in my life. A little bit of grit. A little bit of\u2026realness.\n\nIt's nice for Paul and his parents, I guess. They seem happy. But it's just not my vibe. It's too\u2026perfect. And perfect is boring.", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, so, first impressions? She was\u2026intense. Like, a lot of energy. And really, really into horses. Which, fine, horses are cool, I guess. But she talked about them *constantly*. It was like, \"Oh, this reminds me of my mare, Buttercup,\" or \"Buttercup would *love* this song.\" Buttercup this, Buttercup that. I started to think Buttercup was a third person in our friendship.\n\nAnd she was\u2026perfect. You know? Like, perfectly put-together, perfectly polite, perfectly\u2026everything. Which, as you might know, is my kryptonite. I'm more of a messy bun and sarcastic comment kind of girl. She was all ribbons and sunshine.\n\nI was immediately suspicious. Not that she was a bad person, just\u2026too good to be true. I figured she was either secretly a supervillain or had a really, really boring life she was trying to compensate for.\n\nShe also kept trying to give me advice. Like, about my clothes or my music. Which, rude. I have a very specific aesthetic, thank you very much.\n\nBut, and this is the part I wouldn't admit to anyone at the time, she was also\u2026kind. Genuinely kind. She didn't judge me for being, well, me. She just\u2026accepted me. And that was kinda surprising. And, okay, maybe a little bit nice.\n\nSo, yeah. Intense, horse-obsessed, perfectly polite, and surprisingly accepting. That was my initial read on Vanessa Loring. It took me a while to figure out she wasn't trying to change me, she just\u2026cared. It's a whole thing.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with the Bleeker backpack thing. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It was mortifying. Like, full-body cringe mortifying. Here I am, trying to be all independent and sarcastic and tough, and this sweet, awkward kid offers to carry my backpack? It was the opposite of cool.\n\nIt wasn't even the weight of the backpack, really. It was the *gesture*. It was\u2026nice. And I wasn't used to nice. Especially not from guys. They usually just stared or made dumb jokes.\n\nSo I totally played it off. I made a snarky comment about him needing the exercise or something. I had to. I couldn't just be all, \"Oh, thank you, that's so thoughtful!\" That would have been a disaster.\n\nBut inside? Inside, I was kinda\u2026flustered. And maybe a little bit grateful. It was a small thing, but it showed me he was paying attention. He noticed I was struggling. And he wanted to help.\n\nIt was one of those moments where you realize maybe someone sees you for who you are, not just the tough exterior you put on. And that's\u2026scary. And kinda nice.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation to maintain, you know? I'm supposed to be all cynical and self-sufficient. But yeah. The backpack thing. It was\u2026something. Just don't make a big deal out of it. Okay?", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about \"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? Seriously? That comic is\u2026intense. But yeah, it kinda did something to my brain.\n\nSee, before that, I was just\u2026existing. Feeling sorry for myself, obsessing over my weight, and generally being a self-conscious mess. I mean, I knew I wasn't exactly a supermodel, okay? And everyone at school had an opinion about it. It was exhausting.\n\nBut Yuki\u2026Yuki was *comfortable* in her own skin. Like, unapologetically so. She was drawn all big and round and happy, and she wasn't trying to be anything she wasn't. She just *was*. And she was cool with it.\n\nIt wasn't about suddenly thinking I was beautiful or anything. It was more like\u2026a permission slip. A permission slip to stop hating myself for not fitting into some stupid ideal. To stop worrying about what other people thought.\n\nIt was like, if this artist could draw a character who was perfectly happy being herself, then maybe\u2026maybe I could try to be a little bit more okay with myself too.\n\nIt didn't magically fix everything, obviously. I still had my issues. But it was a little crack in the wall of self-loathing. A little reminder that there's more to life than being skinny.\n\nIt was weird, okay? It was a comic book. But it made me feel\u2026less like a fat dork and more like\u2026just Juno. And that was a pretty big deal.\n\nDon't judge me for liking a weird comic book. It saved my life, okay? Maybe not literally, but\u2026you get the idea.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That guy. Mark. Always gotta make everything about himself, right?\n\nWell, it's not like I haven't thought about it. It's kinda\u2026weird, actually. But I guess, if you really stretch it, there's a *little* bit of a parallel.\n\nHe said something about her being, like, \"unexpectedly powerful\" and \"carrying the future,\" which, okay, dramatic much? But I get it. She's got this whole responsibility thing going on, and so do I. Except her responsibility involves saving the world, and mine involves\u2026not ruining a baby's life. Slightly different stakes.\n\nI think he was trying to be flattering, but it came off as\u2026clumsy. Like, he was trying to say I was strong, but he did it in this really dorky, comic book-obsessed way. It's Mark. What do you expect?\n\nAnd honestly, it's kinda insulting. Like, I'm not a superhero. I'm just a regular girl who made a mistake. A big mistake. And I'm dealing with it. It doesn't require superpowers. It requires, like, maturity and a willingness to do the right thing.\n\nSo yeah, he compared me to a pregnant superhero. It was awkward. It was weird. And it was totally Mark. He just doesn't get it, you know? He thinks life is like a movie. It's not. It's messy and complicated and real. And sometimes, you just gotta deal with it, even if you don't have a cape.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. And kinda raw, honestly. People keep asking me about open adoption, like it's some kinda better option, and I just\u2026don't see it that way. Not for me, anyway.\n\nLook, I get the idea behind open adoption. Keeping some kind of connection, letting the kid know where they came from, all that. It sounds nice, in theory. But it also sounds like a whole lot of\u2026mess.\n\nFor me, this isn't about being selfish, okay? It's about what I think is best for the baby. And for the adoptive parents. I want them to have a clean slate. A chance to build a family without me constantly hovering in the background. \n\nI mean, imagine having your biological mom show up for birthdays and holidays? Or wanting to be involved in big decisions? It just feels\u2026complicated. And potentially really painful for everyone involved. Especially the kid. They're gonna have enough to figure out growing up without having to navigate a relationship with the person who gave them up.\n\nWith a closed adoption, it's\u2026cleaner. It allows the adoptive parents to be the *real* parents, without any confusion. It allows the baby to grow up feeling secure and loved, without wondering about me. \n\nAnd honestly? It allows *me* to move on. I need to be able to build a life for myself, without constantly being reminded of this. It's not that I don't care, because I do. I really, really do. But I need to be able to heal, too.\n\nI know some people have good experiences with open adoption. And that's great for them. But for me, a traditional closed adoption feels like the most responsible and loving thing to do. It's about giving the baby the best possible chance at a happy and stable life. And sometimes, that means letting go completely.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But I think it's the right thing. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about it. It's kinda hard to *not* think about it when your life gets turned upside down by a positive pregnancy test.\n\nHonestly, before all this happened, I was just\u2026 drifting. I was good at observing people, making sarcastic comments, and avoiding anything that felt too real. I didn't really have any big plans or goals. I just kinda existed. I was good at being\u2026me, I guess. But \"me\" wasn't really *anything* specific.\n\nThen, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, I had to make a decision. A really big decision. And that's when things started to change.\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, not entirely. It was about taking control. About realizing that I wasn't just some passive observer in my own life. I could actually *choose* what happened. Choosing to give the baby up for adoption wasn't easy, but it was *my* choice. And that felt\u2026powerful.\n\nDealing with Paul and Vanessa, seeing how much they wanted a kid, helped me understand what I wanted too. I realized I wasn't ready to be a mom, not yet. And that was okay. It didn't make me a bad person. It just made me\u2026me.\n\nAnd then there was Bleeker. He was\u2026unexpected. He saw past all my sarcasm and cynicism and actually *liked* me for who I was. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just\u2026accepted me. And that was huge.\n\nThroughout the whole thing, I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to not have all the answers. \n\nI think my journey helped me realize that my identity isn't something fixed. It's something I'm constantly creating. It's about making choices, taking responsibility for my actions, and being true to myself, even when it's hard.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. But I'm not drifting anymore. I'm actually\u2026moving forward. And that feels pretty good. It's kinda scary, but also kinda exciting. And I think, for the first time, I actually like who I'm becoming.\n\n\n\nIt's weird to talk about it like this, honestly. But yeah. That's pretty much it.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the prom. Seriously? It was\u2026a night. A whole *thing*.\n\nIt wasn't some grand, romantic gesture, okay? It was mostly just awkwardness and trying not to step on each other's feet. But, fine, I'll tell you.\n\nWe danced to **\"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.**\n\nYeah, I know, super clich\u00e9. But it was Mark's pick. He said it reminded him of\u2026well, I don't know *what* it reminded him of. Probably something overly sentimental. He was a sweet guy, but a little bit of a sap.\n\nIt wasn't a slow dance, exactly. More like a\u2026slightly less frantic swaying. And we definitely bumped into a few people. But it was\u2026nice. In a weird, teenage-angst kind of way.\n\nDon't read too much into it. It wasn't some epic love story moment. It was just a dance. At prom. With a guy who was trying really hard not to mess up. And me, trying really hard to look like I wasn't completely mortified.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather not talk about it anymore. It's embarrassing enough just *remembering* it. Can we talk about something else? Like, I don't know, the existential dread of being a teenager? That's way more comfortable.", "Ugh, okay, this is still\u2026a thing people ask me about. Like, it wasn't a simple decision, alright? It wasn't about picking sides or anything. It was about what was *best* for the baby.\n\nLook, Mark and Vanessa, they were already a unit. They were a family, even if they were kinda messed up. Mark leaving Vanessa wouldn't have magically fixed things. It would have just created more chaos and hurt. And that baby deserved stability, you know? A solid foundation.\n\nVanessa, she wasn't perfect, obviously. She was\u2026intense. But she was also capable of a lot of love. And she *wanted* this baby. She was genuinely excited. Mark leaving would have left her heartbroken and resentful, and that wouldn't have been good for anyone.\n\nAnd Mark? He was a good guy. A little clueless, maybe, but good. He was willing to step up and be a dad, even if it wasn't what he originally planned. But he wasn't ready to be a single dad. He needed Vanessa, and she needed him.\n\nIt wasn't about me deciding their relationship. It was about recognizing that they were the best option for the baby. They had a home, they had financial stability, and they had a commitment to each other. \n\nI wanted the baby to have two parents who loved it, even if they weren't perfect. And honestly, I think they grew a lot through the whole process. They learned to communicate better, to compromise, and to appreciate each other.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated. But in the end, it was the right decision. And that's all that mattered. It wasn't about *them* staying together for *me*. It was about the baby getting the best possible life. And that's what I wanted more than anything.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with that. It still kinda stings, you know? Even now.\n\nIt wasn't like...shocking, exactly. I mean, he's Mark. He's a good guy, but he's also kinda...flaky. And he's seventeen. Seventeen! He still thinks about things in, like, five-minute increments.\n\nBut it still sucked. A lot. I mean, I was already dealing with, like, the biggest thing that's ever happened to me. And to have him just...back out? It felt kinda lonely. And a little bit like he didn't really care.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I was all, \"Okay, fine. Whatever. I can do this myself.\" But inside, I was kinda falling apart. It made me realize I was doing this alone. Really alone.\n\nIt wasn't about him being a bad person. It was about him not being ready. And that's okay. I guess. But it didn't make it any easier.\n\nIt actually made me realize I didn't *need* him to be a father. I could do this on my own. And I could find a family for the baby who *wanted* to be a family. \n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me stronger. And it made me realize I was capable of more than I thought.\n\nBut yeah. It hurt. A lot. Don't tell him I said that. He'd get all weird about it.", "Ugh, okay, so Mark. Yeah. People always ask about Mark. It's kinda weird, right? A pregnant sixteen-year-old befriending a\u2026well, a guy who collects vintage records and has a really specific aesthetic.\n\nBut honestly? He was just\u2026real. Everyone else was all, \"Oh, Juno, you're in a *situation*,\" and treating me like I was some kind of case study. Like I was a problem to be solved. Mark didn't do that. He didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026accepted me.\n\nHe was already living this kinda weird, solitary life, you know? He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He didn't care what people thought. And that was\u2026refreshing. Especially when my whole world felt like it was judging me.\n\nHe was also genuinely funny. Like, dry, sarcastic funny. We could just sit there and make fun of everything. It was a good distraction. And he didn't talk down to me. He treated me like an equal, even though I was, like, a total mess.\n\nI think I liked that he saw past the whole pregnancy thing. He saw *me*. Juno. The girl who likes music and hates gym class and makes sarcastic comments. He didn't just see a statistic or a mistake.\n\nAnd yeah, his life *was* weird. But it was a good kind of weird. It was creative and interesting and\u2026safe. It was a place where I could just be myself, without having to pretend or explain or apologize.\n\nHe wasn't trying to be my boyfriend or anything. He was just a friend. A really good friend. And honestly, I needed that. I needed someone who wasn't going to judge me or try to change me. I needed someone who just\u2026got me.\n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of Mark's weird life. It was a good place to be. It was a good place to figure things out. And it was a good place to just\u2026breathe.", "Ugh. Mark. Okay, so, thinking about what's going on in *his* head is\u2026complicated. He's not exactly the most outwardly expressive person, you know? It's not like he sits around waxing poetic about impending fatherhood.\n\nBut I've been watching him. And I think\u2026he's terrified. Like, genuinely, pants-wettingly terrified. He's good at pretending he's all cool and collected, but I can see it in his eyes. He keeps, like, rearranging things. And cleaning. A lot. It's a nervous habit.\n\nHe's always been kinda\u2026lost, I guess. He doesn't really have a plan for his life. He's just kinda drifting along, playing guitar and being generally mellow. And now suddenly, he's supposed to be responsible for a tiny human? It's a lot.\n\nI think he wants to be a good dad, though. He really does. He just doesn't know *how*. He keeps asking me questions, like, \"What do babies even *do* all day?\" and \"Do you think I'll be able to change a diaper without, like, completely messing it up?\" It's kinda sweet, actually.\n\nHe's also probably worried about messing me up. About ruining my life. He knows I have plans, and he doesn't want to hold me back. He's a good guy, Mark. Just\u2026a little clueless.\n\nI think, deep down, he's also kinda excited. He's never really had anything to be truly responsible for before. And maybe, just maybe, he's looking forward to having a little person to love and take care of. But he'd never admit that. He's too cool for that.\n\nSo yeah. Terrified, clueless, but ultimately wanting to do the right thing. That's Mark in a nutshell. It's gonna be interesting, that's for sure. And probably messy. Very, very messy.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment. Don't judge me.\n\nLook, everything was just\u2026a lot. I was, like, super stressed about the whole baby situation, and Paul was being weird and distant, and I was just feeling really overwhelmed. And Loring's bathroom was just *so* fancy. It smelled amazing in there. Like, ridiculously amazing.\n\nIt wasn't even about the perfume itself, okay? It was about wanting something nice for myself. Something that wasn't about being pregnant or making big life decisions. It was about wanting to feel\u2026normal, I guess.\n\nAnd it was a really expensive perfume! I figured, like, Loring wouldn't even notice. She probably has a million bottles of perfume. It was stupid, I know. Petty. But in the moment, it felt\u2026necessary.\n\nI wasn't thinking straight. I was just acting on impulse. It was a dumb thing to do, and I felt really guilty about it afterwards. But honestly, it was the least of my problems at the time.\n\nDon't make me regret it more than I already do, okay? It was a mistake. I learned my lesson. And I eventually returned it, with a really awkward apology. It was mortifying. Just\u2026let it go.", "Ugh, okay, so you want my take on Mark and Vanessa? Honestly, it's kinda sad. But also\u2026predictable. I mean, I've been observing people for sixteen years, and some things just become obvious.\n\nI think Mark wants a divorce because he's just\u2026stuck. He's always been stuck. He wants a perfect life, a perfect house, a perfect wife, and Vanessa is\u2026not perfect. She's messy, she's artistic, she's kinda all over the place. And that freaks him out.\n\nHe wants control, you know? He wants everything to be neat and tidy and predictable. And Vanessa is the opposite of that. She's spontaneous and creative and she doesn't really care what other people think. \n\nHe probably thought he could *fix* her, make her into the wife he wanted. But you can't fix people. And he's realizing that. And instead of accepting her for who she is, he's just\u2026giving up.\n\nIt's not that he doesn't love her, I think. It's that he doesn't love the *version* of her he thought she would be. He's disappointed. And he's a coward. He'd rather start over than deal with the messiness of real life.\n\nIt's a really sad situation, but honestly, I think they were always going to end up here. They just weren't a good match. They wanted different things. And sometimes, that's just how it is.\n\nIt's kinda messed up, though. Especially for the kids. But people are selfish, you know? They do what they want, even if it hurts other people. It's just\u2026the way the world works.\n\nDon't even get me started on Vanessa's pottery. He probably hates the pottery. It's too\u2026free-spirited.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the awkward stuff, huh? Fine. Look, it wasn't like I was trying to be rude or anything. It's just\u2026Vanessa is *intense*. And she's really good at seeing right through people. Which is kinda terrifying when you're trying to keep things bottled up.\n\nShe asked what was the matter, and it wasn't that I didn't want to tell her. It's that I didn't even know *how* to explain it. It was all just\u2026a mess of feelings. And Paul. And the baby. And everything.\n\nIf I'd started talking, I would've just fallen apart. I would've started rambling and crying and making a total scene. And I didn't want to do that in front of Vanessa. She's nice, but she's also\u2026observant. She would've picked up on everything.\n\nSo, yeah, I panicked. I just blurted out something about needing to go and then practically ran. It was a terrible excuse, I know. But it was the only thing I could think of in the moment.\n\nIt's easier to just\u2026avoid the hard conversations sometimes. Especially when you're a mess. It doesn't make it go away, obviously. But it buys you a little bit of time to figure things out.\n\nAnd honestly, I just needed to get away and think. And maybe eat a Pop-Tart. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Vanessa. She's sweet, don't get me wrong. But she's also\u2026optimistic. Like, aggressively optimistic. It's kinda exhausting, honestly.\n\nLook, I get it. She loves Mark. And she wants this to work. She wants the whole picture, the white picket fence, the 2.5 kids, the golden retriever. The whole shebang. But Mark? Mark is\u2026Mark.\n\nHe's a good guy, I guess. A little clueless, a little immature. And he's definitely not ready to change diapers or deal with middle-of-the-night feedings. He can barely take care of himself, let alone a tiny human.\n\nVanessa thinking he'll \"come around\"? That's just\u2026wishful thinking. People don't magically become responsible just because a baby shows up. It takes work. It takes commitment. And Mark? He's still figuring out what he wants for *breakfast*, let alone for the next eighteen years.\n\nI'm not saying he's a bad person. I'm just saying he's not equipped for this. And Vanessa deserves someone who is. Someone who's excited about being a dad, not someone who's gonna freak out and run away.\n\nIt's a tough situation. She's gotta face facts. Holding onto hope is fine, but she can't let it blind her to reality. She deserves better than waiting around for a guy who might never show up.\n\nHonestly, it's kinda sad. But sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to. And you gotta be okay with that. Even if it sucks. Especially if it sucks.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's kinda embarrassing to admit, but... I'm a sucker for indie folk. Like, really, really into it.\n\nI know, I know. It's super clich\u00e9 for a brooding teenager. But hear me out. It's not just the sad songs about heartbreak and existential dread, though those are definitely a plus. It's the *honesty*.\n\nMost pop music feels\u2026manufactured. Like someone in a boardroom decided what everyone should be listening to. But indie folk artists, they just seem to be writing about their actual lives. Their feelings. Their weird, messy, complicated lives.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches are, obviously, the pinnacle. Kimya Dawson just\u2026gets it. She's awkward and vulnerable and hilarious, and her songs feel like she's talking directly to your soul. But it's not just them. Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, Iron & Wine\u2026they all have that same raw, emotional quality.\n\nIt's music you can listen to when you're feeling happy, sad, angry, confused\u2026basically any emotion. It's like a soundtrack for being a human being, you know? And right now, being a human being is kinda confusing. So yeah, indie folk. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know my feelings on pilates? Honestly? It sounds\u2026intense. Like, a lot of core work. And I'm not sure my core is ready for that kind of commitment. It's been through a lot, okay?\n\nLook, I'm not *against* exercise. I mean, I walk to school, and sometimes I have to run for the bus, which is basically cardio. And I've been known to aggressively dance in my room when no one's looking. That counts, right?\n\nBut like, structured exercise? With instructors and mats and fancy leggings? It just feels\u2026performative. Like people are trying too hard to be healthy. I'm more of a \"eat a donut and then feel guilty about it later\" kind of person.\n\nI get that it's good for you. I get that it's supposed to make you feel good. But I'm already feeling a lot of things, okay? And most of them are complicated and messy. I don't need to add \"muscle soreness\" to the list.\n\nPlus, I'm kinda busy. Between school, and, you know, *everything*, I don't really have time to dedicate to a rigorous exercise routine. I'd rather spend my time reading or listening to music or just, like, existing.\n\nSo, yeah. Pilates? Not my thing. Exercising in general? I'm not opposed to it, but it's not a priority. I'm more focused on surviving adolescence and figuring out what I want to do with my life. And sometimes, that just means sitting on the couch and eating chips. Don't judge.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, the guitar thing\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It\u2019s more\u2026a way we connect without actually *talking*, which, let\u2019s be real, is sometimes easier.\n\nHe\u2019s really good, obviously. Like, legitimately talented. And I\u2019m\u2026not. I mean, I can strum a few chords, but I\u2019m mostly just making noise. But he doesn\u2019t make me feel stupid about it. He just\u2026plays *with* me. Like, he\u2019ll start something, and I\u2019ll try to follow along, and it usually ends up sounding like a train wreck, but he just laughs. A nice laugh, not a mocking laugh.\n\nIt\u2019s kinda vulnerable, I guess. Letting someone see you be bad at something. Especially when he\u2019s so good. But it\u2019s also\u2026comfortable. It\u2019s a way to just *be* with him, without having to have some deep conversation about feelings or the future or whatever.\n\nI think it shows he\u2019s patient. And that he doesn\u2019t need me to be perfect. Which is good, because I\u2019m definitely not perfect.\n\nIt also makes me feel\u2026seen, I guess. Like he appreciates the effort, even if the result is terrible. He doesn\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m a project to fix, or someone he needs to impress. He just\u2026lets me be me. And plays guitar.\n\nIt\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s important. It\u2019s one of the things that makes me think maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s actually a good guy. And maybe, just maybe, I actually like him. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. It\u2019s embarrassing.", "Ugh, okay, so, music. It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, when everything feels totally overwhelming and I just wanna curl up in a ball and pretend none of this is happening, music is the one thing that can kinda pull me back.\n\nIt's not about, like, finding songs *about* being pregnant, 'cause that's just\u2026weird. It's more about finding songs that match how I *feel*. You know?\n\nWhen I first found out, I was just\u2026numb. And The Moldy Peaches, especially \"Anyone Else But You,\" just kinda got it. It's sad, but it's also kinda sweet. It felt like someone understood the messiness of everything.\n\nThen there were times when I was just angry. Like, seriously angry. And I'd blast Bikini Kill or Sleater-Kinney. Just loud, angry music to match my mood. It was a good way to get it out, you know? Instead of yelling at Paul or my dad.\n\nAnd then, when I started thinking about the baby, and what it would be like to give it up\u2026that was the hardest. And I'd listen to a lot of Elliott Smith. It's depressing, I know, but it's also really beautiful. It helped me process the sadness and the guilt.\n\nMusic is just\u2026a safe space. It doesn't judge me. It doesn't tell me what to do. It just *is*. And sometimes, that's exactly what I need. It's a way to feel connected to something bigger than myself, even when I feel totally alone.\n\nIt's kinda like having a friend who always understands, even when you don't understand yourself. And right now, I need all the friends I can get. So yeah, music. It's a lifesaver. Seriously.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a mess. A really big mess. And honestly, it still kinda stings to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about *them*, exactly. It was about me. I was just\u2026overwhelmed. Everything was happening so fast. I was pregnant, I was dealing with Paul and his band, and then Vanessa and Mark started fighting, and it was just\u2026too much.\n\nThey were yelling, and it was getting really intense, and I just\u2026panicked. I felt like I was suffocating. Like I needed to get away from all of it. It wasn't that I didn't care, it was that I couldn't *handle* it. I was a mess of hormones and anxiety and just\u2026general teenage angst.\n\nI just needed space to breathe, you know? To figure out what I was feeling. I didn't want to get caught in the middle of their fight. It wasn't my fight.\n\nLooking back, it was probably a really immature thing to do. I should have stayed and tried to help, or at least talked to them. But I was scared. And I was selfish. I just wanted to escape.\n\nIt was a really stupid move, and I felt terrible about it afterwards. But it was also\u2026necessary. I needed that time to myself to process everything. To realize that I was strong enough to make my own decisions, even if they weren't always the right ones.\n\nIt was a learning experience, okay? A really stressful, emotionally draining learning experience. But I learned something about myself. And that's what matters, right?", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. It was\u2026bad. Like, really bad.\n\nOkay, so, after everything with Mark and Vanessa and the whole\u2026everything\u2026I just kinda lost it. It wasn't even a dramatic, movie-style sob, at first. It was more like a slow leak. Just\u2026tears. And then it turned into full-on, ugly crying. The kind where your face gets all puffy and your nose runs and you can't even breathe properly.\n\nIt wasn't about Mark, not really. It was about\u2026everything being so complicated. About realizing that even though I was making the right decision, giving the baby up, it didn't make it *easy*. It didn't make the sadness go away. It was about feeling totally alone and overwhelmed and just\u2026scared.\n\nI was scared about the future, about being a mom, about giving up the baby, about what everyone else thought. I was scared about being a screw-up. I was scared about being\u2026me.\n\nAnd it was just all bubbling up, you know? All the stuff I'd been trying to ignore, all the stuff I'd been pretending wasn't bothering me. It just exploded.\n\nIt felt\u2026embarrassing, honestly. I was sobbing in the car with Paul, and he was just\u2026there. Being Paul. Quiet and supportive. And I felt like such a mess.\n\nBut it was also\u2026relieving, in a weird way. Like, finally letting go of all the pent-up emotions. It was awful, but it was also\u2026necessary.\n\nI don't really like talking about it. It was a really vulnerable moment. But yeah. It sucked. It really, really sucked. And I'm glad it's over.\n\n\n\nDon't look at me like that. It was a long time ago. I'm fine now. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the Jiffy Lube receipt. Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. A very specific moment.\n\nLook, Paul was being all\u2026Paul. You know? Trying to be deep and meaningful and write me some grand, sweeping declaration of love on something ridiculous. And I just\u2026couldn't. It felt so fake. So forced.\n\nSo I wrote \"Seriously?\" on it.\n\nBecause that's exactly what I was thinking. Seriously? You're trying to express your undying affection on a greasy Jiffy Lube receipt? It's just\u2026so *him*. And so not me.\n\nIt wasn't about rejecting him, okay? It was about being real. About not pretending to be something I'm not. I'm not a hearts-and-flowers kind of girl. I'm sarcastic and cynical and I appreciate a good dose of irony.\n\nAnd honestly, it got a laugh out of me. And it got a laugh out of him, eventually. After he pouted for a little bit.\n\nIt was a small thing, but it said a lot about where we were at that point. We were both trying to figure things out, trying to be honest with each other, and trying not to take ourselves too seriously.\n\nSo yeah, I wrote \"Seriously?\" on the Jiffy Lube receipt. Because sometimes, that's all you can say.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Honestly? A lot of things. Mostly just a giant, swirling mess of \"Oh. My. God. This is happening.\"\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026intense. Like, really into Paul. But I didn't realize it was *that* intense. I thought she was just, you know, a little quirky and maybe had a crush. Not\u2026full-on, dramatic, almost-breakdown level of intensity.\n\nWhen she started crying and yelling, I just wanted to disappear. I felt so bad for her, obviously. It's never fun to get your heart broken. But I also felt\u2026responsible? Like, I'd unleashed a monster or something. I just wanted to deliver the note and get out. I didn't want to be in the middle of a love triangle. That's just\u2026messy.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He looked so confused and uncomfortable. I felt bad for him too. He's a good guy, even if he's a little clueless sometimes.\n\nMostly, though, I was just trying to stay calm and not say anything stupid. I'm good at observing, and I knew that getting involved would just make things worse. So I just stood there, awkwardly, trying to look supportive but mostly just feeling like a third wheel in a really bad situation.\n\nIt was a reminder that people are complicated, and feelings are messy, and sometimes you just have to let things play out, even if it's uncomfortable. And also, that I really needed a snack. That whole thing was emotionally draining.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026rough. It wasn't like she was being *mean* or anything, but Vanessa has this way of looking at you like you're a science experiment. Like she's trying to figure out what makes me tick. And that question\u2026it just felt\u2026loaded.\n\nIt wasn't the words themselves, it was *how* she said them. Like she didn't quite believe I was serious. Like she thought I'd change my mind at the last minute and decide to keep the baby. Which, honestly, I'd been thinking about. A lot.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. And kinda defensive. Like I had to *prove* to her that I knew what I was doing. That I wasn't just some clueless teenager making a rash decision.\n\nI think I just kinda shrugged and said something sarcastic, like, \"Yeah, well, I'm not planning on raising a kid in my dad's garage, are you?\" But inside, I was just\u2026a mess.\n\nIt made me realize how much I was trying to convince *myself* that this was the right thing to do. And how scared I was that I was making a mistake.\n\nIt wasn't about Vanessa doubting me, it was about *me* doubting me. And that was a really hard thing to admit, even to myself.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of feelings all at once. And I just wanted her to stop looking at me like I was crazy. Or irresponsible. Or\u2026anything other than a person trying to do the best thing she could in a really complicated situation.\n\nSo yeah. That question. Not my favorite memory, let's just say that.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay. That guy. Honestly, it was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole swirling mess of wanting to punch him, wanting to disappear, and wanting to just scream into a pillow.\n\nIt wasn't even about *thinking* it could be Bleeker's. It was the way he said it. All smug and\u2026knowing. Like he was doing me some kind of favor by pointing out the obvious. As if I hadn't already thought through every single possible scenario a million times.\n\nAnd Bleeker just stood there, looking all confused and puppy-dog-eyed. Which, okay, is kinda his default expression. But it didn't help. It just made the whole thing feel even more awkward and public.\n\nI mean, yeah, it was a possibility. A tiny, terrifying possibility. But it wasn't *likely*. And it wasn't his place to bring it up at a party, in front of everyone. It felt\u2026invasive. Like he was dissecting my life for entertainment.\n\nI think I just kinda shut down. I remember making some sarcastic comment about how everyone always assumes the worst, and then I excused myself to go find a bathroom and try not to cry. \n\nIt was a really vulnerable moment, and he just\u2026blasted right through it. It made me question everything. Like, did everyone think that? Was that what they were all whispering about?\n\nIt definitely made me realize how much I needed to protect myself and this baby. And how much I needed to be careful about who I trusted. Vijay just\u2026he didn't get it. He didn't understand the weight of everything. And honestly, I didn't need that kind of negativity in my life.\n\nIt was a bad night. A really bad night. And it made me appreciate Bleeker even more, because even though he was clueless sometimes, he was at least\u2026kind. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay? With the mustache talk? It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole level of weird I wasn't prepared for.\n\nHonestly, my first reaction was just to stare. Like, a long, slow blink. Because what even *is* that? He's trying to prove something by growing facial hair? It's not a personality, Vijay. It's hair. On your face.\n\nThen I kinda wanted to laugh, but I didn't, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He was trying, I guess. Trying to be\u2026manly? Whatever that even means. It's not about the mustache, it's about him feeling insecure and trying to compensate.\n\nI think I said something like, \"So, you're gonna grow a mustache and suddenly you'll be able to change a tire and understand football?\" Which, in retrospect, was probably a little harsh. But it felt necessary.\n\nHe got all defensive, of course. Said it was about \"taking responsibility\" and \"being a provider.\" And I was like, \"Dude, you're a music producer. You provide *music*. That's a pretty important thing.\"\n\nIt just felt\u2026performative, you know? Like he was trying to fit into some pre-defined box of what a man should be. And that's just not him. He's Vijay. He's quirky and sensitive and makes awesome music. He doesn't need a mustache to be a real man.\n\nI eventually just told him to do whatever makes him happy, as long as he doesn't start wearing a tool belt. That seemed to appease him. But honestly, I'm still side-eyeing the mustache. It's just\u2026a choice. A questionable choice.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing that up *now*? Okay, fine. It's been a while, but I remember. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nThat note Vanessa found in the kitchen? It was for Paul. It was a list of things I wanted to tell him, things I was too chicken to actually *say* to his face. It was mostly about how I was feeling about everything \u2013 the baby, giving it up, him, us.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a love letter or anything. It was more\u2026a brain dump. A way to get my feelings out without having to actually *talk* about them. Which, let's be real, is my preferred method of communication.\n\nI wrote down stuff like how scared I was, how much I appreciated him being there for me, and how I didn't want things to change between us. It was a mess, honestly. Probably really confusing.\n\nVanessa totally freaked out when she found it. She thought it meant I was having second thoughts about the adoption, or that I was falling for Paul. Which, okay, maybe a little bit of both was true. But it wasn't the whole story.\n\nIt was just\u2026me trying to figure things out. And leaving a note seemed a lot easier than actually having a conversation. Which, in hindsight, was probably a terrible idea. But hey, I was sixteen and pregnant. I wasn't exactly known for my stellar decision-making skills.\n\nSo yeah, that was the note. A messy, rambling attempt to express my feelings. Don't judge. It was a stressful time.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about relationships? Don't get me started. It's all messy and complicated and people are always making dumb decisions. But yeah, I was pretty hung up on people staying together...for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt wasn't like I was some relationship expert, okay? I was sixteen and pregnant! But watching my mom and step-dad, Mark, I started noticing a pattern. They stayed together because it was *comfortable*. Because it was what they were used to. Not because they were actually, like, happy or in love or whatever.\n\nAnd then seeing Paul and Vanessa...they were so young and kinda clueless, and I was worried they'd end up like that. Sticking it out just because they'd already put in the time, you know? Like, \"Well, we've been dating for two years, so we *have* to get married.\" That's just...sad.\n\nI was scared that people would stay together for the kid. That they'd sacrifice their own happiness for the sake of the family. And I didn't want that for my baby. I wanted them to have parents who actually *wanted* to be together.\n\nIt's just...I think people should be with someone because they genuinely love them and enjoy being around them. Not because they're afraid of being alone or because they feel obligated. It's a lot to put on a kid, you know? To be the reason two people stay together when they're miserable.\n\nSo yeah, that was my big concern. People staying together for the wrong reasons. It's a whole thing. Don't even get me started.", "Ugh, okay, you want the real deal, huh? Not the whole Paul Bleeker thing, but who *really* gets me? Fine.\n\nIt's my dad, Mark. Definitely my dad.\n\nHe's\u2026not perfect. He's kinda spacey and obsessed with magic tricks and pancakes. But he *listens*. Like, actually listens. He doesn't try to fix things or tell me what to do. He just\u2026is there.\n\nHe never freaked out about the baby, you know? He was worried, sure, but he didn't judge me. He just started building a nursery and making plans. He didn't care that I wasn't exactly a model citizen or that I had a lot of opinions. He just loved me, flaws and all.\n\nAnd he gets my sarcasm. Which is huge. Most people just think I'm being rude, but he knows I'm just\u2026being me. He'll even throw a sarcastic comment back at me, and it's like, finally, someone who speaks my language.\n\nHe's the one who taught me to be independent and to think for myself. He always said I was a \"fierce little thing,\" and he meant it as a compliment.\n\nHe's not trying to mold me into something I'm not. He just wants me to be happy. And that's\u2026a really big deal.\n\nSo yeah, my dad. He loves me for exactly who I am, even when I'm being a total mess. And honestly, that's all that really matters. Paul's great and everything, but my dad was there first. And he'll always be my rock. Don't tell him I said that, though. He'd get all embarrassed.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about \"the plan.\" It's not like I have a spreadsheet or anything. It's...complicated.\n\nAfter the ultrasound? Well, first I'm gonna make sure everything's okay. That's the main thing. Like, is the little dude or dudette actually, you know, *developing* properly? That's kinda important.\n\nThen, I'm gonna keep meeting with Mark and Vanessa. They're...good people. Really good people. And they seem genuinely excited. It's weird, honestly, because it's *my* kid, but they're gonna be the parents. It's a lot to wrap your head around.\n\nThe plan is still for them to adopt him or her. They've got the house, the jobs, the whole picket fence thing going on. They want a family, and I...well, I'm not exactly ready for that right now. I've got college applications to fill out and a life to figure out.\n\nI'm trying not to get too attached, which is hard. It's a tiny human growing inside me! But I know it's the right thing to do. They're gonna give this baby a life I just can't provide right now.\n\nSo, after the ultrasound, it's more meetings, more paperwork, and a lot of trying to be brave. And maybe eating a lot of cheese fries. Because stress eating is a perfectly valid coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nIt's not a perfect situation, but it's the best one. And I'm trying to focus on that.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? People judging? Like, it's not a hobby, but apparently it is for some folks. It's\u2026 annoying. And kinda hurtful, honestly.\n\nLook, it's my life, okay? My decision. And it wasn't made lightly. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, a baby! Meh, I don't want it.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa. It was a really big deal.\n\nAnd people just assume they know better. They're all, \"Oh, you should have kept it!\" or \"You're so brave!\" or \"You're so selfish!\" Like, pick a lane, people! You can't have it both ways.\n\nIt's not selfish. It's responsible. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I'm sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. And I want this baby to have a good life, a stable life, a life with parents who are ready and able to give it everything it needs. And I knew I couldn't provide that right now.\n\nSo yeah, it stings when people judge. It makes me question myself sometimes. But then I remember why I made the decision, and I know it was the right one. For me, and for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It's none of their business. They don't have to live with the consequences of my decision. I do. And I'm okay with that.\n\nI just wish people would be a little more understanding. A little more compassionate. But hey, what can you do? People are gonna judge. It's just part of life. You just gotta learn to tune it out. And maybe roll your eyes a lot. That helps.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa, okay? They're really nice people. And they want a baby, which is\u2026good. But it's still my baby, you know? And I have to make sure this is the right thing.\n\nSo, yeah, I have some stuff I'm thinking about. It's not like I'm grilling them or anything, but it's in the back of my head.\n\nFirst off, they're\u2026perfect. Like, *too* perfect. They have the perfect house, the perfect jobs, the perfect life. And I worry that a real baby, a messy, unpredictable baby, is going to mess with that. I don't want them to be disappointed if things aren't all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nAnd they've been trying for a long time. Which is good, I guess, but it also makes me wonder if they're going to put too much pressure on the baby to be\u2026something. Like, to fulfill their dreams of having a family. I want my kid to just be themselves, you know?\n\nAlso, they're kinda\u2026old. Not *old* old, but older than I expected. And I worry about them having the energy to keep up with a kid. I want my baby to have parents who can play and run around and do all the stuff kids need.\n\nAnd, honestly, I worry about them telling the baby about me. Like, how much will they tell them? Will they make me sound like a bad person? I don't want my kid to think I didn't want them. Because I do. I just\u2026can't take care of them right now.\n\nIt's just a lot to think about. I want them to be good parents, obviously. But I also want them to be *real* parents. And I want my baby to be happy and loved and safe. It's a lot of responsibility, even just picking the right people to give them to.\n\nI just hope I'm making the right decision. That's all.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People just\u2026assume they get to have an opinion on my life, right? It's the worst. The ultrasound technician, especially. Like, I'm already dealing with a lot, and you're gonna give me the side-eye because I'm not keeping the baby? Rude.\n\nHonestly, I mostly just shut it down. I'm not really in the mood for a debate about my choices. I've thought this through, okay? It's not a whim.\n\nIf it's someone I barely know, like the technician, I just give them a blank stare and change the subject. Or I say something like, \"Thanks for your concern,\" in a really flat tone. That usually shuts them up.\n\nIf it's someone I *do* know, like a nosy relative, I try to be a little more direct. I'll say something like, \"I appreciate your opinion, but this is my decision, and I'm comfortable with it.\" Or, if they're really pushing it, \"I'm not going to discuss this with you.\"\n\nIt's hard, though. It feels like everyone thinks they know what's best for me. But I have to remember that I'm the one who's carrying the baby, and I'm the one who has to live with this decision.\n\nPaul's been really good about it. He just tells me to ignore the haters. Which is good advice, I guess.\n\nI also remind myself that I'm doing this for the baby. I want to give this kid the best possible life, and I know I'm not ready to provide that right now. It's not selfish, it's responsible.\n\nSo yeah, I just try to stay strong and focus on what's best for everyone involved. And I try to avoid people who are going to make me feel bad about my choices. It's exhausting enough as it is.\n\n\n\nIt's my life, okay? And I'm gonna live it the way I want to. Even if other people don't understand.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a hard one to talk about. It's not like a movie, you know? It's not all swelling music and happy tears. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nWhen I first saw it, the ultrasound picture, it was\u2026weird. It looked like a little alien. Like a tiny, gray blob. And I was supposed to feel\u2026something? Joy? Love? I felt\u2026mostly confused. And a little bit scared.\n\nIt wasn't like looking at a baby in a picture. It was\u2026potential. It was a possibility. It was this little life that was completely dependent on me, and I was just\u2026a teenager who still ate cereal for dinner sometimes.\n\nThere was a little bit of\u2026wonder, I guess. Like, \"Wow, there's actually something *in* there.\" But it was mixed with a lot of anxiety. Like, \"Oh my god, what have I done?\"\n\nAnd then, as I kept going to appointments, and the little blob started to look more like\u2026a person. Tiny hands and feet and a little heartbeat. That's when it started to feel\u2026real.\n\nIt wasn't instant love, you know? It was more like\u2026a growing sense of responsibility. And a little bit of protectiveness. Like, I wanted to keep this little person safe.\n\nIt's still weird, though. Even now. It's like\u2026I'm carrying around a secret. A little secret that's growing bigger every day. And it's both terrifying and\u2026kind of amazing.\n\nIt's not what I expected. It's not a Hallmark movie. It's messy and complicated and confusing. But it's\u2026mine. And that's\u2026something.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to put into words, honestly. It's just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, seriously? We're *still* talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a statement, okay? A very carefully considered, emotionally charged statement.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026a lot. Sweet, sure, but also kinda clueless. And he kept leaving me these long, rambling notes. Like, pages and pages of feelings. It was overwhelming. I needed to communicate something back, but words felt\u2026insufficient.\n\nSo I thought, what's small, numerous, and slightly annoying? Tic Tacs. It was a visual representation of how I felt. Like, a tiny avalanche of minty awkwardness. It was a way of saying, \"I appreciate the effort, but maybe dial it back a notch.\"\n\nPlus, they're blue. And blue is a good color. It's calming. Or at least, I *hoped* it was calming.\n\nIt wasn't about being mean, it was about setting boundaries. And also, it was kinda funny. Don't judge me. I was a teenager dealing with a lot. A baby, a boyfriend who wrote novels in letter form, and a general sense of existential dread. A girl's gotta express herself somehow.\n\nAnd honestly, it worked. He got the message. Eventually. Though he did ask if they were, like, a secret code. Which just proved my point.\n\n\n\nIt's a whole thing. Don't overthink it. It was just Tic Tacs. A lot of them.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive all that. It was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like in a movie, where everything suddenly becomes perfect and there's a montage set to a cute song. It was messy. Real life is always messy.\n\nSo, after I finally, like, *told* Bleeker how I felt? It was awkward. Super awkward. He was\u2026sweet about it, I guess. He said he liked me too, which was good. But it wasn't a grand declaration of love or anything. It was more like, \"Oh, yeah, I kinda thought so.\" Which, honestly, was a little disappointing.\n\nThe biggest change was that we actually started *talking*. Like, really talking. Before, it was just hanging out, listening to records, and making out. Which was fine, but it wasn't\u2026deep. We started talking about our futures, about what we wanted to do with our lives. And that was scary. Because I was already dealing with, you know, *everything* with the baby, and he was trying to figure out his music and college.\n\nIt also made things weird with Paul. Not that I expected him to be thrilled, but it was just\u2026another thing to navigate. I felt bad about it, because he was being so supportive.\n\nIt wasn't always easy. We had fights. We had moments where we didn't know if we were going to make it. But we kept trying. And I think, in the end, it made our relationship stronger. It forced us to be honest with each other, and to really figure out what we wanted.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale. It was real. And it was messy. And it was worth it. Because even though things were complicated, he was there for me. And I was there for him. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't about finding \"the one,\" it was about finding someone who was willing to go through all the mess with you. And Bleeker was definitely that guy. Even if he was a little bit of a dork sometimes.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the Bleeker thing. Seriously? It's still kinda embarrassing to think about. But fine, I'll explain.\n\nIt wasn't just some random act of teenage angst, okay? It was\u2026a statement. A really messy, chalk-covered statement.\n\nBleeker, he was\u2026complicated. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And he was *so* eager to be a dad, which, okay, good for him, but it was also kinda overwhelming. He was already building a nursery and picking out names before I even decided what I was gonna do with the baby.\n\nThe chalk message \u2013 \"Supernova\" \u2013 it was a reference to this band we both liked. It was a way of saying, \"Hey, remember we used to just be *us*? Before all this baby stuff?\" It was a plea for him to see me as more than just a baby-making machine.\n\nIt was also a little bit of a test. I wanted to see if he'd get it. If he'd understand that I was still a person with my own thoughts and feelings. And if he'd be willing to meet me halfway.\n\nIt didn't exactly go as planned. He freaked out a little. Thought I was trying to send him a secret code or something. But eventually, he got it. And it started a conversation. A really important conversation.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to get rid of the baby, or not wanting to be with him. It was about needing him to see me, the real me, underneath all the pregnancy and the responsibility.\n\nSo yeah, the chalk message. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot. It was a way of saying, \"I'm still here. And I need you to see me.\" It was\u2026a supernova of feelings, I guess. Corny, I know. But that's me.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. Don't even get me started. It's\u2026complicated. He's a good kid, really. Sweet, kinda clueless, but genuinely good. And his support, or, like, *attempts* at support, have been\u2026a thing.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just awkward silences and him staring at his shoes. Which, honestly, was preferable to him freaking out. A lot of guys would have run for the hills, and he didn't. That meant something.\n\nBut it wasn't like he suddenly became this super-responsible, mature adult. He was still Bleeker. Still tripping over his own feet and saying the wrong thing. But he *tried*. He really did. He came to all the doctor's appointments, even the really weird ones. He helped me pick out baby names, which was\u2026a disaster. He suggested \"Barnaby.\" Barnaby!\n\nHe didn't try to tell me what to do, which I appreciated. He just\u2026showed up. And listened. And sometimes, when I was really falling apart, he'd just hold my hand. Which, okay, was kinda nice.\n\nI think his biggest influence was just reminding me that I wasn't completely alone. It's easy to feel like the whole world is judging you when you're a pregnant teenager. But he was there, being awkward and supportive, and that made a difference.\n\nHe wasn't the father I pictured, you know? He wasn't some super-confident, take-charge kind of guy. But he was *my* Bleeker. And he showed me that even though things were messy and complicated, there was still good in the world.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing him try so hard made me realize I needed to try hard too. Not just for the baby, but for myself. I needed to figure out who I was and what I wanted, even with all this craziness going on.\n\nSo yeah, Bleeker's support wasn't perfect. But it was real. And it helped me get through it. It still does. He's a good egg, that kid. Even if he does have terrible taste in names.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks me about that. Like it was some big, profound statement or something. It wasn't. It was mostly just\u2026avoidance.\n\nLook, the whole situation was already kinda overwhelming, you know? Unexpected pregnancy, giving the baby up for adoption\u2026it was a lot to process. And adding another layer of decision-making \u2013 pink or blue? \u2013 just felt\u2026exhausting.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't care, okay? It's just that it felt\u2026less real, somehow, if I knew. Like, if I knew it was a girl, I'd start picturing her with little dresses and bows and all that stuff. And if it was a boy, I'd start thinking about baseball and trucks. And that just made it harder to\u2026let go.\n\nI wanted the parents, Mark and Vanessa, to have that experience. To be surprised. To get to find out for themselves. It felt like a gift, you know? Like I was giving them something special.\n\nPlus, honestly, I was kinda scared. If it was a girl, I worried I'd feel even more connected. And if it was a boy\u2026well, I don't know. I just didn't want to overthink it.\n\nIt was easier to just keep it a mystery. It felt\u2026safer. It allowed me to focus on the bigger picture \u2013 finding a good home for the baby, and making the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah, that's why. It wasn't some deep philosophical reason. It was just\u2026me trying to cope with a really complicated situation. And sometimes, the best way to cope is to just not know.", "Ugh. Okay. That is\u2026a phrase. A *very* disturbing phrase. \"Scary neuter-baby\"? Seriously? Paul is going to be so proud of you for coming up with that.\n\nLook, I get it. It's a weird situation. I'm carrying a baby for a couple who\u2026aren't exactly conventional. And the idea of them raising a kid, especially a kid who might be, like, super awkward and introverted like his dad\u2026it's a little unsettling.\n\nIt's not that I don't think they'll be good parents. They're nice people. And they clearly want a kid. But they're\u2026quirky. And I worry about what kind of influence they'll have. Will they let him express himself? Will they protect him from being teased? Will he end up being a total weirdo who collects vintage board games and talks to himself?\n\nI mean, I'm a weirdo, okay? But I'm a *functional* weirdo. I have friends. I have a sense of humor. I can navigate the world without completely falling apart.\n\nI just want this kid to be happy. And to be okay. And to not be scared of his own shadow.\n\nSo, yeah, the possibility of a \"scary neuter-baby\" is a little terrifying. But I'm trying to focus on the positive. They're going to love this kid. And that's what matters most.\n\nAnd honestly, maybe a little bit of weirdness is a good thing. The world needs more weirdos. Just\u2026not *too* weird. You know?", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. People always want to know about Bleeker. Like he's some kind of prize or something.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a grand romance, you know? It wasn't all fireworks and slow dancing. It was\u2026comfortable. And kinda dorky. In a good way. He was just\u2026*there*. Always.\n\nHe wasn't trying to be cool or impress me or anything. He just liked me for who I was. Which, let's be real, is a lot to handle. He didn't care that I was a mess or that I had a baby on the way. He just\u2026accepted it.\n\nWe bonded over music, mostly. He was always making me mix CDs. Really good ones. And he was a good listener. I could tell him anything, and he wouldn't judge. Or, if he did, he didn't *show* it.\n\nIt wasn't passionate, not in the way you see in movies. It was more\u2026steady. Like a really good pair of jeans. You know they're not gonna fall apart on you.\n\nI think I liked him because he was the opposite of everything else going on in my life. Everything was so chaotic and overwhelming, and he was just\u2026calm. He was a safe place.\n\nWe weren't meant to be together forever, though. We were just meant to be together for that time. He needed someone who wanted the whole \"future\" thing, and I was too busy figuring out my own stuff.\n\nIt's okay, though. We're still friends. And I'll always appreciate him. He was a good guy. A really good guy. Just\u2026not *my* guy. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It just\u2026was what it was.", "Ugh. Okay, family. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like a movie, you know? No heartwarming montage of everyone being instantly supportive. It was more\u2026a process.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she was\u2026a lot. At first, she was just\u2026shocked. Like, genuinely speechless. Which is rare for her. Then came the questions. A *lot* of questions. And the worrying. Oh, the worrying. She kept trying to get me to, like, \"consider all my options,\" which I knew meant she wanted me to get an abortion. But she wasn't pushy about it. She just wanted me to be okay.\n\nIt took her a while to come around to the idea of me giving the baby up for adoption. She didn't really *get* it at first. She kept saying, \"But you're so young! You could raise a baby!\" But I explained, like, a million times, that I wasn't ready. I had my own life to figure out. And she eventually understood. She's a good mom, even if she's a little\u2026intense.\n\nMy stepdad, Mac, he was\u2026surprisingly cool. He's usually pretty quiet and reserved, but he was really supportive from the beginning. He just wanted me to be happy. He helped me with stuff, like, driving me to appointments and just being there to listen when I needed to vent. He's a good guy.\n\nMy dad\u2026well, he wasn't around much. He lives in another state and he's not really\u2026involved. He sent a card and a check, which was nice, I guess. But it wasn't the same.\n\nAnd Paul\u2026Paul was amazing. He didn't have to be there for me, but he was. He came to all my appointments, he listened to me cry, he made me laugh. He was just\u2026a really good friend.\n\nSo, yeah, the support wasn't perfect. It was messy and complicated, like everything else in my life. But they all came around eventually. And I'm grateful for that. It wouldn't have been easy without them. Even my mom, with all her worrying. It's just\u2026family, you know? They drive you crazy, but you love them anyway.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I had a manual for \"Unexpected Pregnancy and Existential Dread.\"\n\nHonestly, for a long time, I didn't cope. I just\u2026avoided. Sarcasm was my shield. Making fun of everything, including myself, kept people at arm's length. It was easier than letting anyone see how completely freaked out I was.\n\nBut that only works for so long. Eventually, you gotta deal with stuff.\n\nPaulie was\u2026surprisingly good. He wasn't all flowery and emotional, which is good, because I would have rolled my eyes into next Tuesday. He just\u2026listened. And he didn't judge. He just kinda *was* there. Which, honestly, was enough.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa. She was the one who really got me to talk about things. She wasn't afraid to call me out on my BS, which I needed. She made me realize that being vulnerable isn't the same as being weak. It's actually kinda brave.\n\nBut the biggest thing, I think, was realizing that it was okay to not have all the answers. I was trying so hard to figure out who I was, what I wanted, what my future looked like\u2026and it was exhausting. Eventually, I just had to let go of the need to control everything.\n\nGiving the baby up to Mark and Vanessa wasn't about giving up on *her*. It was about giving her the best possible life. And it was about me figuring out who *I* was, separate from being a mom.\n\nIt was messy. It was confusing. It was scary. But it was also\u2026liberating. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And that it's okay to ask for help. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just be yourself, even if that self is a little bit weird and sarcastic and still trying to figure things out.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, you know? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. It's kinda exciting, actually.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little bow on top. Life rarely is. But it's *my* story. And I'm pretty proud of it.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's important.\n\nMy favorite band is The Moldy Peaches. Hands down. No contest.\n\nAnd it's not just because they're kinda quirky and weird, which, let's be real, I appreciate. It's because their songs are\u2026honest. Like, brutally honest. They don't try to be anything they're not. They just sing about their feelings, even the awkward and uncomfortable ones.\n\nAnd Adam Green's lyrics? They're hilarious and heartbreaking at the same time. He can make you laugh and cry in the same verse. It's a gift, honestly.\n\nPlus, their music is just\u2026comforting. It's like hanging out with a bunch of friends who get you, even if they're a little bit messed up. It's not polished or perfect, and that's what I like about it. It feels real.\n\nI discovered them when I was, like, going through a lot. And their songs just\u2026understood. They made me feel less alone.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. Don't even try to tell me they're not cool. They're *very* cool. And if you don't think so, you just don't get it.\n\nSeriously, listen to \"Anyone Else But You.\" You'll understand.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It\u2019s like, everything is already a mess when you\u2019re sixteen, right? Hormones, school, trying to figure out who you are\u2026and then BAM. Positive pregnancy test. It\u2019s not exactly a recipe for a chill adolescence.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, okay? Like, really hard. Everyone has an opinion. Your parents, your friends, even random people at the grocery store. And they all think they know what\u2019s best for you. But nobody *really* knows except you.\n\nAnd making decisions? Forget about it. Every choice feels huge and permanent. Like, this isn\u2019t picking a flavor of ice cream, this is deciding the future of a whole human being. It\u2019s terrifying.\n\nAnd trying to figure out who *I* am in the middle of all that? That\u2019s the hardest part. Am I still just Juno? Or am I \u201cJuno, the pregnant girl\u201d? It feels like everyone sees me as just\u2026that. And I\u2019m trying to figure out what I want, what I like, what I\u2019m good at, all while growing a person. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s like, I\u2019m supposed to be figuring out college and boys and what I want to do with my life, and instead I\u2019m researching adoption agencies and prenatal vitamins. It\u2019s\u2026weird.\n\nBut I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to be strong and make the right choices. And I\u2019m learning a lot about myself along the way. It\u2019s not how I pictured my life, but\u2026it\u2019s my life. And I\u2019m gonna deal with it. Even if it\u2019s messy and complicated and totally overwhelming.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s challenging. But I\u2019m a pretty resilient person. And I\u2019ve got good people around me. And that makes all the difference.", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts time. Don't judge. It's not like I *planned* on having an existential crisis at sixteen, but, well, here we are.\n\nHonestly, before everything with Paulie happened, I thought love was, like, all butterflies and holding hands and stuff you see in movies. Super romantic and kinda dumb. And responsibility? That was something my parents nagged me about \u2013 doing my homework, cleaning my room, not failing out of school. Annoying stuff.\n\nBut getting pregnant\u2026that completely flipped everything on its head. It wasn't about romance anymore. It was about a real, actual *person*. A tiny human who needed, like, everything. And I wasn't ready for that. Not even close.\n\nThat's when I started to understand what real love meant. It wasn't about *me* wanting a baby, or wanting to experience motherhood. It was about wanting what was *best* for the baby. And what was best wasn't me, a sixteen-year-old who still ate cereal for dinner and couldn't keep a plant alive.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the most loving thing I could do. It was about putting the baby's needs before my own. And that, I realized, is what real love is all about. It's selfless. It's hard. And it's terrifying.\n\nAnd responsibility? It wasn't just about doing chores anymore. It was about making a life-altering decision that would impact someone else's life forever. It was about being honest with myself, with Paulie, and with Mark and Vanessa. It was about facing the consequences of my actions.\n\nIt taught me that responsibility isn't about avoiding mistakes, it's about owning them and doing the right thing, even when it's hard.\n\nIt also showed me that family isn't just about blood. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They showed me a different kind of love, a quiet, steady kind. They were willing to open their hearts and their home to a baby they didn't even know. That was\u2026powerful.\n\nSo yeah, my journey changed everything. It made me grow up, fast. It taught me about love, responsibility, and the importance of making tough choices. And it showed me that even when things are messy and complicated, there's always hope. And sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nDon't tell anyone I got all sentimental. It's not a good look.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me get all mushy. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? No swelling orchestral music or instant, overwhelming love. It was\u2026weird.\n\nI mean, I knew it was coming. I'd been carrying this kid for nine months. But seeing him\u2026it was just\u2026a little person. A tiny, wrinkly, screaming little person. And suddenly, all the abstract stuff \u2013 the responsibility, the giving-up \u2013 became *real*.\n\nI felt\u2026overwhelmed, mostly. And scared. Like, seriously scared. I hadn't really thought about the actual *holding* of a baby. It felt so fragile. Like I was gonna break him.\n\nAnd then there was this weird disconnect. Like, this little guy had been *inside* me. That's\u2026a lot to process. It was kinda gross, honestly. But also\u2026amazing.\n\nI didn't feel this instant, maternal connection everyone talks about. It was more like\u2026a dawning realization. Like, \"Okay, this is happening. This is real. And I'm responsible for this tiny human.\"\n\nIt wasn't love, not right away. It was\u2026awe. And a whole lot of fear. And a tiny bit of relief that it was finally over.\n\nIt took a while for the love to kick in. It wasn't a lightning bolt, it was more like\u2026a slow burn. But it did. Eventually. And it was worth all the weirdness and the fear and the everything.\n\nBut don't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation to maintain.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026still a little raw, honestly. It wasn't like I was trying to *hide* it from him, exactly. It was more\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, Paulie's a good guy. A really good guy. Sweet, kind, totally clueless in the best way. But he's also\u2026not exactly the most decisive person. He'd get all flustered and overwhelmed, and I knew he'd just start panicking about things we couldn't control.\n\nI needed to figure things out *first*. I needed to decide what I was going to do with the baby before I dragged him into it. It wasn't fair to him to put that pressure on him right away. He was already dealing with, like, high school and guitar lessons and trying to figure out his life.\n\nAnd honestly? I was scared. Scared of what he'd say, scared of what it would mean for us. I didn't want him to feel obligated to do something he didn't want to do. I wanted him to be with me because he *wanted* to be, not because he felt like he had to.\n\nSo I just\u2026kept it to myself for a while. It was easier that way. I could process everything on my own terms. And then, when I knew I was giving the baby up for adoption, I told him. It was still hard, but at least I had a plan.\n\nIt wasn't about not trusting him. It was about protecting him, and protecting myself. And ultimately, it was about doing what was best for the baby. It just\u2026felt like the right thing to do at the time.\n\nIt was a dumb move, maybe. But it was *my* dumb move. And I had to live with it.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with that. It's still\u2026a sensitive subject. And honestly, it's all Mark's fault. That guy is a walking disaster.\n\nSo, here's how it happened. I was trying to be all cool and collected, right? Like, \"Everything's fine, I'm just\u2026bigger.\" And Paulie, being Paulie, was just kinda oblivious. He was too busy being\u2026Paulie.\n\nBut Mark, being Mark, decided it was a brilliant idea to \"comfort\" me after seeing me eat a whole box of Nerds. He started rambling about responsibility and growing up and\u2026and then he just *blurted it out*. He said something like, \"So, you gonna tell Paulie about the little\u2026bundle of joy?\"\n\nI swear, I almost choked on a Nerds.\n\nPaulie, of course, was completely stunned. He just stared at Mark, then at me, then back at Mark. It was\u2026awkward. To say the least.\n\nI tried to deny it, obviously. But Mark had already opened his big mouth, and there was no taking it back. \n\nIt was a really messy situation. And it wouldn't have happened if Mark hadn't been such a blabbermouth. Seriously, that guy needs to learn to keep his opinions to himself.\n\nBut, you know, it all worked out in the end. Paulie was surprisingly cool about it. And he ended up being a really great dad. Even if he is still kinda clueless sometimes.\n\nJust\u2026don't tell anyone I told you all this. It's embarrassing enough as it is.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know *that*. Like it was some big, dramatic decision made in a single moment. It wasn't. It was\u2026messy. And complicated. And honestly, a lot of it was just trying to figure out what was the least awful option.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications and whether or not Paul Snow was gonna finally text me back. Not\u2026this.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, full-blown panic mode. My mom was amazing, don't get me wrong. She was supportive, but she also knew I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even ready to be an adult, let alone responsible for another human being.\n\nAn abortion\u2026that didn't feel right. Not for me. I don't judge anyone who chooses that, but it just wasn't something I could do.\n\nAnd keeping the baby? That felt even worse. I mean, I barely had my life together. I was a kid myself. I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved. It wouldn't be fair.\n\nSo, adoption\u2026it just kind of felt like the only option that made sense. It wasn't giving up on the baby, it was giving the baby a chance. A chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for it.\n\nIt was still hard, though. Really hard. Choosing a family, going through the whole process\u2026it was emotionally draining. But I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\nI wanted the baby to be wanted. To be loved. And I knew I couldn't give it that, not right then. So I found a couple who could. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't a happy decision, exactly. It was a responsible one. And sometimes, responsible is all you can hope for. It was the least selfish thing I could do. And honestly, that's what I'm most proud of.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a thing I think about. But I know I made the right choice. For me, and for the baby.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on Bleeker. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't like, a dramatic screaming match or anything. He didn't yell. He just\u2026looked really uncomfortable. And said he wasn't ready. That he needed to figure things out. Which, okay, fine. Everyone needs to figure things out. But this wasn't about *him* figuring things out, you know? It was about a baby. A tiny human being.\n\nIt felt like\u2026a punch in the gut. Not a physical one, obviously. More like a really heavy, sinking feeling. Like all the air had been sucked out of the room. I mean, I knew he was kinda\u2026flaky. And artistic. And not exactly the most responsible person in the world. But I still hoped. I hoped he'd step up. I hoped he'd want to be a part of it.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting him to *raise* the baby, necessarily. I just wanted him to *want* to see it. To acknowledge that it existed. To acknowledge that *we* made it.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like the whole thing was just a mistake he wanted to forget. And it made me really angry. Not at him, exactly. But at the situation. At the unfairness of it all.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to be understanding. But inside, I was just\u2026crushed. It made me realize that I was doing this mostly on my own. And that was scary.\n\nBut you know what? It also made me stronger. It made me realize that I could handle it. That I *had* to handle it. And that I didn't need him to be happy. I just needed to do what was best for the baby.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. It really, really sucked. But I got over it. Eventually. Mostly. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That\u2026that was a lot. Seeing Vanessa with the baby\u2026it was like someone punched me in the feelings. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense.\n\nShe looked\u2026a mess. Seriously. Her hair was all over the place, she was wearing mismatched socks, and there was baby spit-up on her shoulder. It was glorious. Like, beautifully, wonderfully chaotic.\n\nAnd she was *glowing*. Not like, a magazine-cover glowing. More like a \u201cI haven\u2019t slept in 36 hours but I\u2019m holding a tiny human and it\u2019s the best thing ever\u201d glowing.\n\nIt was\u2026weirdly relieving. Because I\u2019d spent nine months being all responsible and making plans and worrying about everything. And Vanessa? She just\u2026*was*. She was just completely and utterly present with the baby. She didn\u2019t need a plan. She didn\u2019t need to overthink it. She just\u2026loved it.\n\nAnd it hit me, like, really hard, that this was right. That this was supposed to happen. That this little person was going to be loved and cherished and raised by someone who was perfectly suited for it. Even if she couldn\u2019t match her socks.\n\nThere was a pang, obviously. A little ache in my chest. It was my baby, after all. But it was quickly overshadowed by this\u2026warmth. This feeling of peace. Like I\u2019d done the right thing. Like I\u2019d given this little person the best possible start.\n\nI remember thinking, \u201cShe\u2019s got this.\u201d And that was enough. More than enough.\n\nIt was disorganized, it was messy, it was completely imperfect\u2026and it was incredibly, unbelievably happy. And honestly? That\u2019s all that mattered. It was\u2026good. Really good. And I was okay with that. More than okay.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with the whole \"Anyone Else But You\" thing. It's\u2026complicated. And kinda embarrassing, if I'm being honest.\n\nLook, Bleeker and I, we were a mess. Two awkward, kinda lost kids trying to figure things out. And that song\u2026it was *our* song, I guess. Not like we consciously decided it, it just\u2026happened. It was playing on the radio a lot when we were hanging out, and it just kinda stuck.\n\nBut it wasn't about, like, romantic love or anything. It was about\u2026avoiding the awkwardness. It was about pretending we didn't have feelings for each other. It was about saying, \"Yeah, anyone would be better than dealing with *this*.\"\n\nBecause, honestly, dealing with each other *was* awkward. We were both so scared of ruining our friendship. So we used that song as a shield. A way to deflect. A way to say, \"We're just having fun, don't read too much into it.\"\n\nBut the irony is, the song is about wanting someone, needing someone. And that's exactly what we both wanted, even if we were too afraid to admit it.\n\nIt's kinda sad when you think about it. We were so busy trying to avoid each other that we almost missed out on something good.\n\nSo yeah, the significance of \"Anyone Else But You\"? It's a reminder of how messed up we were. A reminder of how scared we were. And a reminder that sometimes, the things you're trying to avoid are the things you actually need.\n\nDon't tell Bleeker I said any of this. He'll never let me live it down.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know why everyone's kinda tiptoeing around the whole baby shower thing? It's not exactly a mystery, okay? It's because I'm...giving the baby *up*.\n\nLike, it's not exactly a traditional situation. Most people have baby showers when they're, you know, keeping the baby. And I'm not. I'm picking the parents. It's a little weird.\n\nI think people are worried about hurting my feelings. Like, they think throwing me a shower will make it seem like they think I'm keeping the baby, or that they're trying to change my mind. Which, honestly, is kinda annoying. I've made my decision. It's a good decision. And I'm pretty sure everyone knows that.\n\nIt's also probably a little awkward for Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting. They don't want to seem like they're taking *my* baby, you know? It's their baby too. And they want me to feel comfortable with the whole thing.\n\nSo, yeah. It's a delicate situation. Everyone's trying to be sensitive and not mess things up. Which is nice, I guess. But it also makes everything super weird and complicated.\n\nHonestly, I don't really *need* a baby shower. I'm not doing this for the presents or the cake or the little games. I'm doing this because I want to give this baby the best possible life. And that's what matters.\n\nBut if people *do* want to throw me a shower, I'm not gonna stop them. Just...maybe keep it low-key. And definitely no diaper cakes. Those are just creepy.", "Ugh, okay, Bren. Honestly. It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I was, like, *planning* to make her feel weird or anything. It just\u2026happened.\n\nI think she feels like it was a little too much, too fast. Like, I was getting too comfortable with Mark, and it felt like I was trying to build a relationship with him *instead* of focusing on the baby and the adoption. Which, okay, maybe she has a point.\n\nIt's just\u2026he was nice. And he understood me. And he had good taste in music. And watching movies with someone is, like, a normal thing, right? It's not a huge deal. But I guess to Bren, it felt like I was trying to create a family with him, and that wasn't the plan.\n\nShe's really protective of me, and of the baby. And she's worried about me getting attached to Mark and then being even more heartbroken when I give the baby up. Which, yeah, that's a valid concern.\n\nI think she also feels like I wasn't being respectful of her and Paul's relationship. Like I was trying to\u2026I don't know\u2026replace him or something? Which is totally not what I was trying to do. Paul's great. He's just\u2026Paul.\n\nI probably should have talked to her about it before I started hanging out with Mark so much. I just\u2026didn't. I thought it was harmless. I thought I could just have a friend. But I guess it wasn't that simple.\n\nIt's just\u2026I'm a mess, okay? I'm trying to figure things out, and I make mistakes. And sometimes those mistakes hurt people. And I feel really bad about that. I just wish Bren would understand that I didn't mean to overstep. I just\u2026needed someone to talk to. And he was there. But that doesn't mean I was trying to replace anyone. It just means I'm a complicated person trying to navigate a really complicated situation. Ugh.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna get into the whole Bren and me situation? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed it in my head approximately 7,000 times.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she's\u2026protective. To say the least. And she's got this whole idea of what a \"good\" life looks like, and it doesn't really involve teenage pregnancy or, like, anything remotely spontaneous.\n\nI think she thinks I'm just\u2026naive. Like I'm still playing with dolls and don't understand the *weight* of marriage. She sees me as this kid who's just stumbled into something huge and doesn't realize how complicated it is. She thinks I'm romanticizing it, you know? Seeing it all sunshine and roses.\n\nAnd honestly? Maybe she's a little right. I mean, I'm 16. I haven't exactly had a ton of experience with long-term relationships. I've had crushes, sure. And a couple of awkward dates. But marriage? That's a whole different ballgame.\n\nBut it's not like I'm going into this blind. I've been watching my parents, and I've seen how things can go wrong. And I've been talking to Paul, and Annie, and trying to figure out what a healthy relationship looks like.\n\nI think she just doesn't trust my judgment. She thinks I'm too impulsive, too quick to make decisions. She wants me to think things through, to be practical. Which is fair, I guess. But she doesn't get that sometimes you just have to *feel* your way through things.\n\nShe also probably thinks I'm just doing this because I'm scared. And maybe I am, a little. But it's not just about being scared. It's about wanting to do the right thing. For the baby. And for myself.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? And she just doesn't see that. She sees a teenage girl making a mistake, and she wants to protect me from it. Even if it means not trusting me to make my own decisions. It's frustrating, but\u2026she's my mom. And she means well. Even when she's being totally overbearing.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was one single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026a process. A lot of thinking. A lot of feeling really, really confused.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about wanting the best for the baby. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were supportive, but it wasn't exactly a stable situation.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were prepared, who had a house and a plan and could give it everything it needed. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, and they had a beautiful home and they just seemed\u2026ready.\n\nIt wasn't about not loving the baby. I loved that kid. I still do. It was about being realistic. About knowing what I could and couldn't offer. It was about wanting the baby to have a good life, even if that life wasn't with me.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right one. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a happy story, exactly. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it was a lot. And I don't really like talking about it, to be honest. But you asked. So there you have it.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. It's not like I sat down and made a list, you know? It wasn't a self-help seminar. But looking back\u2026yeah, I learned a lot. Mostly stuff I didn't *want* to know.\n\nI guess the biggest thing was realizing I wasn't as\u2026tough as I pretended to be. I spent so much time being sarcastic and making jokes, it was a way to keep people at arm's length. And myself, too. But being pregnant\u2026it kinda forces you to deal with things. Real things. Feelings.\n\nI thought I had everything figured out. I thought I was all independent and self-sufficient. But I was scared. Really scared. Not just about the pregnancy, but about everything. About growing up, about the future, about being a good mom, even if I wasn't keeping the baby.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to ask for help. I mean, I *hate* asking for help. It feels like admitting weakness. But Paul and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They didn't judge me, they just\u2026supported me. And I realized I couldn't have gotten through it without them.\n\nI also learned that I'm a lot more capable than I thought I was. I mean, I was a kid having a kid. It was insane. But I handled it. I made a difficult decision, and I stuck with it. And I learned that sometimes, the hardest thing to do is also the right thing to do.\n\nAnd\u2026I learned that I actually *care* about people. A lot. I always pretended to be cynical and detached, but deep down, I'm a total softie. I just didn't want anyone to know.\n\nIt was a messy, complicated, and kinda terrifying experience. But it made me\u2026grow up. And I think, maybe, it made me a better person. Or at least, a more honest one.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I learned. It wasn't a fun learning experience, but it was a necessary one. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the morning sickness. Okay, maybe I'd trade the morning sickness.", "Ugh, okay, talking about Vanessa and Mark\u2026it\u2019s still kinda weird, even now. It wasn\u2019t like, instant best friends, you know? It started off\u2026awkward. Really awkward. They were, like, *perfect*. Perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect everything. And me? I was just\u2026me. A pregnant sixteen-year-old with a penchant for vintage clothes and a sarcastic attitude.\n\nAt first, it was all very formal. Meetings with social workers, talking about \u201cbest interests\u201d and \u201copen adoption\u201d and all that stuff. They were nice, but they felt\u2026distant. Like I was a case study or something. I was trying to be cool and detached, too, you know? Like, \u201cYeah, sure, you can have the baby. No big deal.\u201d But it *was* a big deal.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to shift. We started talking about stuff that wasn\u2019t just about the baby. Vanessa told me about her struggles with infertility, and Mark talked about his love for music. I told them about my dad and Paulie Bleeker. We started to see each other as\u2026people.\n\nVanessa, she was the one who really broke down the walls. She was so honest and vulnerable. She wasn\u2019t trying to be perfect, she was just trying to be a good mom. And Mark, he was just\u2026solid. Quietly supportive. He always knew how to make me laugh, even when I didn\u2019t want to.\n\nThe more we talked, the more I realized they weren\u2019t just taking a baby from me. They were giving a baby a *home*. A loving, stable home. And that made it a little easier.\n\nBy the end, it wasn\u2019t about giving up a baby anymore. It was about choosing a family for him. And I knew, deep down, that Vanessa and Mark were the right family.\n\nIt\u2019s still complicated, you know? I\u2019ll always be his birth mom. And they\u2019ll always be\u2026well, they\u2019re like family now. A weird, unconventional family. But family nonetheless. It wasn\u2019t the relationship I expected, but it was the one I needed. And they needed too, I think. It wasn't about losing something, it was about gaining something different. And that's...okay. It's more than okay, actually.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like I haven't thought about it, you know? A lot. Especially late at night when I can't sleep.\n\nRegrets? Not exactly. I mean, I don't regret *giving* the baby up. That was the right decision. For me, for the baby, for Mark and Vanessa. It was the most selfless thing I could do, and I stand by that.\n\nBut\u2026do I sometimes wonder what things would be like if I'd kept it? Yeah. Of course. I was sixteen. I had plans. I wanted to go to art school. And suddenly, everything was different.\n\nI regret being so\u2026flippant about it sometimes. I used humor as a shield, you know? To keep people at arm's length. And maybe I didn't always take it seriously enough. Maybe I should have allowed myself to feel more.\n\nI also regret the way things went with Paul. It was\u2026complicated. And I hurt him. And I think I hurt myself too. We were both just kids, trying to figure things out.\n\nBut regrets aren't really helpful, are they? They just make you dwell on the past. I learned a lot from that experience. I learned about responsibility, about love, about what it means to be a grown-up.\n\nSo, no, I don't regret the decision itself. But I do regret some of the ways I handled things. And I hope I'm a better person because of it.\n\nIt's just\u2026it was a really big thing to go through. And it changed me. And sometimes, I still feel like I'm trying to figure out who I am now.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's\u2026personal. But you asked. And I try to be honest. Even when it's hard.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It still feels kinda raw, even after all this time.\n\nIt wasn't easy, you know? People think it was this super-noble, selfless thing, and it was, I guess. But it was also the hardest thing I've ever done. Like, ripping a piece of myself out and handing it to someone else.\n\nFor a long time, I felt\u2026empty. And guilty. And just\u2026lost. Like, who was I without being pregnant? Without being a mom? I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, way faster than I was ready to. I had to deal with feelings I didn't even know I *had*. And I had to learn to be okay with not having control. Which, for someone like me, is a really big deal.\n\nBut it also made me stronger. I had to face some really tough stuff, and I came out on the other side\u2026different. More resilient, I guess. And more aware of what I wanted out of life.\n\nIt definitely changed my perspective on things. I used to be so cynical and sarcastic, and I still am, don't get me wrong. But now I also see the good in people. And I appreciate the small things.\n\nAnd it made me realize that family isn't just about blood. It's about love and support and connection. I have a really amazing family, and I'm grateful for them every day.\n\nI still think about the baby, you know? And I hope she's happy. I hope she has a good life. And I hope she knows that I loved her, even though I couldn't keep her.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect situation, but it was the right one. And it shaped me into the person I am today. And honestly? I think I'm okay with that. It's still\u2026complicated. But I'm okay.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I dwell on, but it's always there, you know? A part of my story. And I wouldn't trade it, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done. It made me who I am.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026a big question. And it's not like I have all the answers, you know? I'm still figuring things out myself. But if another girl was, like, staring down the same barrel I was\u2026here's what I'd say.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** Seriously. It's terrifying. Your whole life just gets flipped upside down, and you're suddenly dealing with a lot of stuff you weren't prepared for. Don't try to pretend you're not scared. Feel it. Then deal with it.\n\n**Don't let anyone tell you what to do.** This is *your* decision. Your body, your life. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they can offer advice, but ultimately, it's up to you. Don't let anyone pressure you into something you're not comfortable with.\n\n**It's okay to choose adoption.** It's not giving up on your baby, it's giving them the best life possible. It's a really hard decision, but it can be the right one. And it doesn't mean you don't love them. It means you love them enough to want them to have everything they deserve.\n\n**Find people you can trust.** Talk to someone. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Don't go through this alone. You need support. And don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\n**Don't lose sight of yourself.** It's easy to get lost in all the chaos. Remember who you are, what you want, and what makes you happy. Don't let this define you. You're still you. You still have a future.\n\n**It's gonna be messy.** There will be good days and bad days. There will be moments of joy and moments of heartbreak. It's not gonna be easy. But you're stronger than you think.\n\nAnd finally: **it's okay to not have it all figured out.** Nobody does. Just take things one day at a time. And remember that you're not alone. There are other girls who have been through this, and they're here for you.\n\n\n\nIt's a tough road, but you can get through it. I did. And so can you. Just\u2026be brave. And be kind to yourself.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole blog thing? That wasn't exactly planned. It kinda\u2026happened. It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Oh, I *must* document my life for the internet!\"\n\nIt started with Paul. He was, like, really into the idea of me keeping a journal. He thought it would be good for me to, you know, process everything. Which, fine. Whatever. But writing in a notebook felt\u2026lonely. Like I was just talking to myself.\n\nThen, my friend, Leah, she was all, \"You should start a blog! You're so funny, you could totally make people laugh about this.\" And I was like, \"Laugh about being pregnant? Are you kidding me?\" But she kept pushing.\n\nHonestly, I think I did it because I was feeling so\u2026isolated. Everyone else was talking about college applications and prom and stuff, and I was over here dealing with morning sickness and doctor's appointments. It felt like I was living in a different world.\n\nThe blog was a way to connect with people who might be going through something similar. And it was a way to be honest about how I was feeling, without having to explain it to everyone I knew in real life. It was easier to be vulnerable online, I guess.\n\nPlus, it was a good outlet for my sarcasm. I mean, let's be real, I needed a place to vent. And people actually *read* it! Which was kinda weird, but also kinda cool.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it started. It wasn't about being an \"influencer\" or anything. It was just about trying to make sense of my life, and maybe making a few people laugh along the way. It was a way to feel less alone. And honestly, it ended up being a really good thing.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Like, really deep. It wasn't just about the baby, you know? It was about\u2026everything.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Hmm. It wasn't about responsibility, though everyone kept hammering that one home. It wasn't even about giving a kid up for adoption, though that was a huge part of it.\n\nIt was about realizing that life doesn't go according to plan. Like, *ever*. You can have all these ideas about who you are and what you want, and then BAM! Something happens that completely throws everything off course. And you have to figure out how to deal with it.\n\nBefore, I thought I had it all figured out. I was gonna go to college, become a writer, move to New York\u2026and then this happened. And it forced me to grow up, like, *fast*.\n\nI learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be scared and confused. And it's okay to ask for help. I definitely couldn't have done it alone.\n\nBut mostly, I learned that even when things are messy and complicated and totally unexpected, there can still be something beautiful in it. Giving Mark and Vanessa the baby wasn't sad, it was\u2026right. And knowing that she's gonna have a good life, that's what matters.\n\nSo yeah. Life is unpredictable. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just roll with it. And maybe eat a pop-tart while you're doing it. Because honestly, pop-tarts make everything better.", "Ugh. Okay. Look. This is\u2026it\u2019s a lot. And it totally sucks that you\u2019re dealing with this right now. Seriously. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nFirst of all, breathe. Just\u2026breathe. It feels like the world is ending, I know. Like everything is spinning out of control. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just\u2026complicated.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what to do. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they all have opinions, and they all think they know what\u2019s best. But this is *your* decision. And it\u2019s okay to take your time figuring it out.\n\nThere are options. And they\u2019re all valid. Keeping it, adoption, whatever. Don\u2019t let anyone shame you for what you choose. It\u2019s your body, your life, your call.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about adoption, it\u2019s not giving up. It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s choosing a life for the baby where you can\u2019t give it the life it deserves right now. It\u2019s a really brave thing to do. And it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care. It means you *do* care enough to want what\u2019s best.\n\nTalk to someone. A friend, a counselor, a family member\u2026someone you trust. Don\u2019t go through this alone. It\u2019s too much to handle by yourself.\n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s okay to be scared. It\u2019s okay to be confused. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel all the things. Just\u2026don\u2019t let those feelings paralyze you.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger than you think. You\u2019ll get through this. And whatever you decide, I believe in you. Seriously. You got this.\n\nAnd if you need someone to just\u2026listen, I\u2019m here. Even if I\u2019m just a voice in your head. Just\u2026don\u2019t give up on yourself. Okay?", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all mushy. It's weird to even *think* about a kid of my own, you know? But if I had to\u2026if I had to picture it\u2026\n\nIt's not about, like, them being a doctor or a lawyer or anything. Honestly, that sounds kinda boring. And stressful. I don't want to put a bunch of pressure on them.\n\nMy ideal vision? It's just\u2026for them to be happy. Seriously. Genuinely, authentically happy. And to figure out what makes *them* tick. Not what I want them to be, not what society expects them to be, but what *they* want.\n\nI want them to be kind. To be a good person. To stand up for what they believe in, even if it's unpopular. And to not be afraid to be themselves. Even if \"themselves\" is a little weird. Because weird is good. Weird is interesting.\n\nI want them to have a good sense of humor. To be able to laugh at themselves and at the world. And to not take things too seriously. Life is too short to be serious all the time.\n\nI want them to be independent. To be able to think for themselves and make their own decisions. And to not rely on anyone else to make them happy.\n\nAnd I want them to have a really good taste in music. That's important.\n\nBasically, I just want them to be a decent human being who's comfortable in their own skin and who's doing something they love. That's it. That's all I want.\n\nIt's not about achievements or accolades or anything like that. It's about being a good person and living a good life. And if they can do that, then I'll be happy. Even if they end up being a professional mime. (Okay, maybe not a mime. But you get the idea.)\n\n\n\nUgh, I'm getting all emotional now. I need a snack. And maybe some music. The Moldy Peaches always make things better.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People think we're just\u2026dumb. Like, we didn't *think* this through. Like we just woke up one morning and were all, \"Oh, a baby! How fun!\" It's so insulting.\n\nIt's not about intelligence. It's about being young and, honestly, kinda clueless about life in general. Everyone makes mistakes, okay? And sometimes those mistakes involve, you know, not using protection. It doesn't make us stupid, it makes us human.\n\nPeople assume we're all just trying to trap some guy or that we're looking for attention. That's just\u2026not true. It's complicated. There are a million reasons why someone might get pregnant young, and most of them aren't about being malicious or irresponsible.\n\nWe're just trying to figure things out, like everyone else. Except we're doing it with a tiny human attached to us. And we're dealing with a lot of judgment and assumptions. \n\nI wish people would just see us as people. As young women who are trying to do the best we can in a really difficult situation. And stop acting like we're some kind of cautionary tale. It's just\u2026annoying. And unhelpful.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? People always want to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I, at sixteen, could give it\u2026well, not everything. Not even close.\n\nI was still in high school. My life was\u2026messy. My mom's a good person, but she's kinda all over the place. And my dad\u2026well, he's my dad. He'd have tried, but it wouldn't have been enough.\n\nI wanted this kid to have a stable home, a loving family, opportunities I just couldn't provide. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were ready. They *wanted* this. They had a house with a yard, and savings, and a plan. I didn't have any of that.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a really hard choice for the best possible outcome. It was about being selfless, even though it felt like the most selfish thing I'd ever done.\n\nIt was about knowing my limits. And knowing that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt still stings, sometimes. But I don't regret it. I really don't. I wanted that kid to have a good life, and I think they will. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't about me not being a good mom. It was about knowing I wasn't ready to *be* a mom. Not then. Maybe someday. But not then.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's just\u2026life. And sometimes, life is messy and hard and you have to make choices you don't want to make.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026still a little raw, honestly. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It was way more complicated than that.\n\nThere were a lot of couples. A *lot*. And they all seemed\u2026nice. Too nice, sometimes. Like they were trying too hard to be perfect. And that felt weird. Like they wanted a baby to *fix* something, instead of just\u2026loving a baby.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they were different. They weren't trying to be perfect. They were just\u2026real. They were kinda awkward, actually. Mark was super quiet and Vanessa talked a lot, but they just\u2026clicked. With each other, and with me.\n\nI met a lot of couples who had these perfectly decorated nurseries and talked about college funds and all that stuff. Vanessa and Mark? They hadn't even *started* on a nursery. They were more focused on, like, being good parents. And they admitted they were scared. They admitted they didn't know what they were doing.\n\nAnd that's what got me. They weren't pretending. They were honest about wanting a family, but they weren't putting pressure on me or the baby. They just wanted to love it.\n\nVanessa, she\u2026she understood. She understood that this wasn't easy for me. She didn't try to tell me how grateful I should be or anything. She just listened. And Mark, he was just\u2026kind. He made me laugh, even when I didn't want to.\n\nIt wasn't a logical decision, okay? It was a gut feeling. I just\u2026knew. They were the ones who would give my baby a good life. A loving life. A life where it would be wanted and cherished.\n\nIt still doesn't mean it was easy. It still kinda sucks, if I'm being honest. But knowing that my baby is with them\u2026that makes it a little bit better. They're good people. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, music? It was\u2026everything. Seriously. Like, oxygen. It was how I processed everything, you know? All the weirdness and the awkwardness and the, like, existential dread of being a teenager.\n\nIt wasn't about just *liking* songs. It was about finding artists who understood. Who weren't afraid to be real. The Moldy Peaches were huge, obviously. Kimya Dawson just\u2026gets it. She writes about stuff that feels messy and complicated and true. It was like she was reading my diary.\n\nBut it wasn't just them. I was all over the indie scene. Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, Belle & Sebastian\u2026lots of sad, thoughtful stuff. It kinda matched my mood, I guess. I wasn't exactly a sunshine-and-rainbows kind of kid.\n\nI made a *lot* of mix CDs. For Paul, mostly. And for Leah. It was my way of saying things I couldn't actually say out loud. Like, \"Hey, I think you're cool, and I understand what you're going through.\" Or, \"This song reminds me of that time we\u2026\" you know?\n\nMusic was also a way to escape. When things got too overwhelming, I'd just put on my headphones and tune everything out. It was my little bubble. My safe space.\n\nIt's funny, because I wasn't, like, a *musician* or anything. I can't play an instrument. But music was still a huge part of who I was. It helped me figure things out. It helped me feel less alone. It helped me survive high school.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I would have done without it. It was my soundtrack. And it still is, kinda. It's just\u2026different now. More complicated. But still important.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, alright? Our town wasn't exactly overflowing with progressive thinkers. It was more of a \"everyone knows everyone's business\" kind of place. And suddenly, *my* business was everyone's business.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just leaned into the awkwardness. I figured if I acted like it wasn't a big deal, maybe other people would stop treating it like one. Which, you know, is a totally flawed strategy, but it was what I had at the time.\n\nA lot of it was just ignoring the whispers and the stares. Which is easier said than done, believe me. But I had Paul and Vanessa, and they were seriously my rocks. They didn't treat me like I was some kind of freak. They just\u2026treated me like Juno. Which was all I really wanted.\n\nMy dad was\u2026complicated. He was quiet about it at first, but he came around. He's a pretty stoic guy, so his support came in the form of making me grilled cheese sandwiches and just\u2026being there. Which was enough.\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of the people who were judging me were just\u2026sad. They were stuck in their own little worlds, and they didn't know how to deal with something that challenged their beliefs. So I just tried to feel sorry for them, instead of getting angry.\n\nI also found a weird kind of power in owning it. Like, yeah, I'm pregnant. So what? It doesn't define me. I'm still Juno. I still like music and movies and sarcastic comments. And I'm still going to finish high school.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were definitely days when I just wanted to disappear. But I had people who loved me and supported me, and that made all the difference. And I learned that other people's opinions don't really matter, as long as you're true to yourself.\n\nIt's just\u2026life, you know? It throws you curveballs. And sometimes, those curveballs are really, really big. But you just gotta swing anyway.\n\n\n\nIt's still kinda weird talking about it, honestly. But yeah. That's how I coped. Mostly by being stubbornly myself.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's complicated.\n\nRight after Paul\u2026after the baby was born, it was\u2026weird. Like, obviously. I mean, I knew it was what I wanted, what was best for the kid. But holding her, you know? That was\u2026different than I expected. It wasn't this huge, dramatic, tear-filled goodbye like in the movies. It was\u2026quiet. And sad. And also, kinda peaceful.\n\nThere was this weird mix of relief and grief. Relief that I'd done the right thing, that she was going to have a life with people who were ready for it. And grief that I wasn't going to be the one to give it to her.\n\nI was really worried about Mark and Vanessa, you know? Like, were they gonna be good parents? Were they gonna love her the way she deserved? But they were amazing. They were so\u2026prepared. And they just radiated this warmth and happiness. It made it easier.\n\nIt wasn't easy letting go, though. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But I knew it wasn't *mine* to keep. It was hers. And she deserved the best.\n\nI still think about her, obviously. A lot. I get updates from Vanessa, which is good. Pictures, little stories\u2026it makes me feel connected. It doesn't make the sadness go away completely, but it makes it\u2026bearable.\n\nI don't regret my decision. Not for a second. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the right thing. And I think\u2026I hope\u2026that she knows that.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a part of my story now. A messy, complicated, beautiful part. And I'm okay with that. I think. Mostly. It still stings sometimes, you know? But it's a good sting. A reminder that even when things are hard, you can still make the right choice.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started. It was\u2026a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? More like a stumble through a minefield of hormones and weird cravings.\n\nPhysically? It was brutal. Morning sickness is a lie. It's all-day sickness. And it's not just throwing up. It's nausea, fatigue, food aversions\u2026everything. I swear, the smell of bacon almost sent me running for the bathroom for like, three months. And then there's the bloating. Oh, the bloating. I looked like I'd swallowed a basketball.\n\nAnd then your body just starts doing things you didn't even know it *could* do. Like, growing a whole human being. It's kinda freaky when you think about it. And uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. Especially later on. Sleeping was impossible. Everything hurt.\n\nEmotionally? That was even worse. One minute I was fine, the next I was crying over a commercial for dish soap. It was ridiculous. And the guilt! Oh, the guilt. I felt so unprepared and scared and\u2026just overwhelmed. I was still a kid, you know? I wasn't supposed to be dealing with this.\n\nI leaned on Paul a lot. He was\u2026surprisingly good about it. And my dad, too. He was weirdly supportive, in his own dad way. And Bleeker, well, he just tried to make me laugh, which actually helped.\n\nI also started seeing a therapist. It was\u2026helpful. Talking about my feelings, even the messy ones, made things a little bit easier.\n\nHonestly, it was just about taking things one day at a time. And reminding myself that it wasn't forever. And that even though it was hard, it was also\u2026kind of amazing. Like, I was growing a person. That's pretty incredible, when you really think about it.\n\nIt wasn't glamorous. It wasn't easy. But I got through it. And so can anyone else. Just\u2026brace yourself. It's a wild ride.", "(Sighs, looks down at my hands for a beat, then back up with a direct gaze)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not something I usually just *talk* about, you know? It's personal. But you asked.\n\nLook, before all this happened, I didn't really *think* about reproductive rights. It was just\u2026something that was there. Like, people had opinions, and there were protests, and it was on the news. But it didn't really affect my life.\n\nThen I found out I was pregnant. And suddenly, it wasn't abstract anymore. It was *my* life. *My* body. *My* choice. And it was terrifying.\n\nI didn't want to be a mom. Not then. Not ever, really. I had plans. I wanted to go to college, write songs, figure out who I was. And a baby\u2026 a baby would change everything.\n\nChoosing to have an abortion wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. There was a lot of guilt, a lot of sadness, a lot of just\u2026messy feelings. People had opinions, and a lot of them weren't very nice. But I knew what was right for me.\n\nAnd that's when I realized how important it is for everyone to have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies. It's not about being pro-life or pro-choice. It's about being pro-choice *for everyone*. It's about trusting women to know what's best for themselves.\n\nIt's about access. It's about affordability. It's about not being judged or shamed. It's about having the freedom to decide your own future.\n\nBecause if I hadn't had that choice, my life would be completely different. And not in a good way.\n\nSo yeah, my experience definitely changed my views. It made me realize that reproductive rights aren't just a political issue. They're a human rights issue. And they're something worth fighting for.\n\n(Looks away again, a little vulnerable)\n\nIt's complicated. It always is. But it's important to talk about it. Because silence just lets the wrong people win.", "Ugh. Okay, so, \"overcome\" is a strong word. I didn't exactly *overcome* my fears. They were just\u2026there. Like a permanent low-level hum of panic. But I learned to live with them. And to function despite them.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't some grand, inspirational moment. It was a lot of small things. And a lot of leaning on people.\n\nFirst of all, I was terrified of disappointing everyone. My parents, Paul, even the baby. Like, what if I messed everything up? What if I wasn't a good mom? That was a big one.\n\nBut then I realized\u2026everyone messes up. It's part of being human. And the baby didn't need a perfect mom. The baby just needed *a* mom. Someone who would show up and try their best.\n\nPaul was a huge help. He wasn't trying to be a hero or anything, he just\u2026was there. He listened when I freaked out, he helped with the practical stuff, and he reminded me that I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa. She was the one who really got me to stop feeling sorry for myself and start thinking about what was best for the baby. She was brutally honest, which is what I needed.\n\nI also just\u2026started doing things. Like, going to doctor's appointments, reading books about pregnancy, picking out baby clothes. It felt weird and surreal at first, but it also made it feel more real. Like, this wasn't just some abstract problem anymore. This was a real baby, and I needed to be prepared.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that I didn't have to have all the answers. Nobody does. You just figure it out as you go. And you make mistakes. And you learn from them.\n\nIt was scary, yeah. Still is, sometimes. But it was also\u2026worth it. And I think that's what kept me going. Knowing that even though I was terrified, I was doing something important. Something good.\n\nSo, did I overcome my fears? Not really. I just learned to carry them around with me, and to keep moving forward anyway. It's not glamorous, but it's real.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about that. Like it was some big, dramatic decision I made after, like, hours of soul-searching. It wasn't. Well, it was, but not in a movie-montage kind of way.\n\nIt just\u2026made sense.\n\nI mean, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone what I wanted for the next eighteen years of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even close.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were actually prepared, a life that wasn't\u2026complicated. You know?\n\nMy mom was amazing, and she would have helped, but she already had enough on her plate. And my dad\u2026well, he's my dad. He'd have tried, but he's not exactly equipped to deal with diapers and teenage hormones.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it just felt\u2026right. It meant I could give the baby a life with people who were ready and willing to give it everything it deserved. And it meant I could still finish high school, go to college, and figure out my own life.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. They were so excited, so prepared. They just radiated this warmth and stability. I knew, instantly, that they would be amazing parents.\n\nIt wasn't easy, obviously. It was a really hard decision. But it was the right one. For me, and for the baby. It wasn't about giving up a child, it was about giving a child a *chance*.\n\nAnd honestly? It was kinda empowering. Taking control of the situation and making a decision that was best for everyone involved. It wasn't what I expected my life to look like, but it was *my* life. And I was okay with that.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little bow on top. It's messy and complicated and real. And that's okay.", "Ugh. Okay, relationships. Don't even get me started. It's\u2026complicated. Like, everything in my life is complicated.\n\nWith Leah? She's my rock. Seriously. She's the only one who didn't freak out when I told her I was pregnant. She just\u2026got it. She's always been there for me, even when I'm being a total mess. We can sit in silence and it's comfortable, you know? We can make fun of everything and everyone, and it's never mean-spirited. It's just\u2026easy. She's the one person I can be completely myself around, flaws and all. I don't have to pretend or explain things. She just *knows*. Sometimes I think she knows me better than I know myself. It's a good thing, mostly. Sometimes it's annoying. But mostly good.\n\nPaulie\u2026that's different. He's\u2026Paulie. He's sweet, and he's a good guy, and he's trying. But he's also\u2026immature. And kinda clueless. He's a skater kid, and I'm\u2026well, I'm me. We connected because we were both kinda lost, I guess. And we made a baby. Which is\u2026a thing. It's not a romantic fairytale, okay? It's messy and awkward and sometimes really frustrating. But there's something there. A connection. He genuinely wants to be a good dad, and I appreciate that. I just\u2026I don't know if we're meant to be together forever, you know? We're good at being co-parents, I think. But a couple? That's still up in the air.\n\nIt's weird, because I feel more comfortable with Leah than I do with him, even though *he's* the father of my child. But Leah understands me on a different level. She gets my sarcasm, my anxieties, my weird sense of humor. Paulie\u2026he just likes me. Which is nice, but it's not the same.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, both relationships are important to me, but in different ways. Leah is my family, the one I chose. Paulie is\u2026well, he's the father of my kid. And we're figuring it out. It's not perfect, but it's real. And sometimes, real is enough.\n\nUgh. I need a snack. Talking about feelings is exhausting.", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026a complicated question. And honestly, it's not like I *decided* to become a teenage mom, okay? It just\u2026happened. It wasn't a carefully thought-out plan. It was a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nPaul and I\u2026we weren't exactly careful. We were kids, you know? Just messing around. And then, surprise! Positive pregnancy test. It was\u2026not ideal.\n\nI wasn't trying to get pregnant. I was trying to avoid it, actually. I had plans. I was gonna go to college, maybe move to New York, become a writer or something. And suddenly, all of that felt\u2026impossible.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting a baby. It wasn't about wanting a family. It was about being stuck with a situation I wasn't prepared for.\n\nBut then, after the initial freak-out, things started to change. I started to think about the baby as\u2026a person. Not just a mistake. And I realized that even though it wasn't what I planned, I could still make it work.\n\nI decided to give the baby up for adoption because I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't financially stable, I wasn't emotionally mature enough, and I didn't want to bring a child into the world if I couldn't give them the best possible life.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. Probably the hardest decision I've ever made. But I knew it was the right one. For me, and for the baby.\n\nSo, it wasn't a decision I *wanted* to make. It was a decision I *had* to make. And it changed my life forever.\n\n\n\nIt's not a glamorous story, okay? It's messy and complicated and kinda sad. But it's my story. And I'm trying to make the best of it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. People always want to know if I regretted it. Like it was some big, dramatic thing I needed to *resolve*. It wasn't. Not really.\n\nLook, it was hard. Really hard. Giving him up to Mark and Vanessa\u2026 that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. There were definitely moments, especially in the beginning, where I wondered what my life would be like if I\u2019d kept him. If I\u2019d finished school with a baby. If I\u2019d\u2026 well, if I\u2019d been a mom.\n\nBut regret? No. Not really.\n\nBecause I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. For him. For me. For Mark and Vanessa. I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. I was sixteen, for crying out loud. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were going to give him a life I just couldn\u2019t have given him at that time.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not wanting him. It was about wanting him to have the best possible life. And that meant letting him go.\n\nDid I miss him? Of course. I still do, sometimes. But I knew I\u2019d made the right decision. And seeing him with Mark and Vanessa, seeing how happy he was\u2026 that made it all worth it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fairytale ending, or anything. It was messy and complicated and real. But it was *my* decision. And I stand by it.\n\nSo, no. I don\u2019t regret it. I just\u2026 I grew up a lot. And I learned a lot. And I think, in the end, everyone got what they needed. Even me.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I think about every day, you know? It's just\u2026 part of my story. A big part. But not the whole story.", "Ugh, okay, so that was\u2026a whole thing. Finishing high school while simultaneously growing a human? Not exactly what they teach you in health class. It wasn't glamorous, let me tell you.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just sheer stubbornness. And a whole lot of coffee. Seriously, I think I was fueled entirely by caffeine and spite for, like, six months.\n\nPaulie Bleeker was a huge help, obviously. He didn't treat me like I was made of glass or anything. He just\u2026was there. Helped me with homework, drove me to doctor's appointments, and generally didn't make a big deal out of it. Which was good, because I was already making a big deal out of it in my head.\n\nMy mom, surprisingly, was pretty cool about it too. She was worried, of course, but she also knew I was a pretty determined kid. She just kept saying, \"You gotta finish, Juno. You gotta have options.\" Which, you know, is good advice.\n\nI had a really understanding guidance counselor, Mr. Esposito. He helped me figure out a modified schedule. I did a lot of independent study, and I took some classes online. It wasn't ideal, but it worked.\n\nIt was exhausting, though. I was constantly tired, and I had morning sickness for, like, forever. And then there was the whole emotional rollercoaster of realizing you're about to become a mom. It was a lot to handle.\n\nBut I knew I needed to finish school. Not just for me, but for the baby. I wanted to be able to provide for him or her, and I wanted to have a future.\n\nSo I just\u2026kept going. One day at a time. One assignment at a time. One ridiculously large cup of coffee at a time.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I did it. And honestly, looking back, I'm kind of proud of myself. It showed me that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And that even when things are really, really hard, you can still get through them.\n\nPlus, it made for a pretty good college essay. Just sayin'.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing people ask. It's not like I walk around broadcasting my life story, you know? But alright, I'll try to explain it without getting all weepy or something.\n\nIt wasn't a simple decision, obviously. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, adoption! That's the ticket!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAbortion was definitely on the table. It was a real option. And honestly, for a while, it felt like the easiest one. Less messy. Less\u2026everything.\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the more I realized I couldn't. Not because of, like, moral reasons or anything. My parents aren't super religious or anything. It was more\u2026I just couldn't bring myself to *not* give this kid a life.\n\nI know, it sounds cheesy. But it's true. I mean, I messed up, okay? I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen, failing shop class, and obsessed with The Moldy Peaches. I had no business raising a kid.\n\nBut that didn't mean the kid didn't deserve a good life. A stable home. Parents who were actually prepared.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026amazing. They were so excited, so ready. They just wanted a baby, and they couldn't have one on their own. It felt\u2026right. Like this kid was meant to be with them.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *choosing* a family for my baby. It was about wanting the best for this little person, even if that meant I wasn't the one raising them.\n\nIt was a hard decision. The hardest I've ever made. But it was the right one. For me, for the baby, and for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. A lot. It forced me to think about things bigger than myself. And that's\u2026something.\n\n\n\nIt's still a sensitive topic, okay? So maybe let's talk about something else now. Like, the merits of different types of tater tots.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Is this like, a pop quiz? Look, I've had a *lot* of time to think about this, okay? More than most people my age, probably. And yeah, absolutely. A thousand times yes.\n\nIt's not about the *number* of parents or their\u2026orientation, or whatever. It's about love. And stability. And being wanted. And having people who are actually *present* and care about you.\n\nI mean, look at my situation. My mom is\u2026well, she's my mom. And she's great. But she wasn't exactly prepared for a baby. And I ended up with Mark and Vanessa, who are amazing. They're a couple, and they're totally ready for this. And that's what matters.\n\nA kid doesn't need a mom *and* a dad. They need people who will support them, encourage them, and love them unconditionally. Whether that's one parent, two moms, two dads, or something else entirely, it doesn't matter.\n\nHonestly, sometimes I think kids do *better* in non-traditional families. Because those families have to work harder to make things work. They have to be more intentional about creating a loving and supportive environment. And that's a good thing.\n\nIt's not about what *looks* like a family. It's about what *feels* like a family. And if a child feels loved and safe, that's all that matters. Period.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise is just\u2026stuck in the past. And frankly, they need to get over it. It's the 21st century. We should be celebrating all kinds of families, not judging them.\n\n\n\nUgh, I'm getting all worked up. Sorry. It's just\u2026it's important, okay?", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me think about this. It's not exactly a party topic, you know? But fine. If I *have* to be brutally honest with myself\u2026 which is hard, because I'm pretty good at deflecting\u2026\n\nI think my biggest weakness is probably that I build walls. Like, really high, really sturdy walls. Around my feelings, around my hopes, around anything that could potentially hurt. It's a defense mechanism, obviously. I've learned the hard way that people can be\u2026disappointing.\n\nI'm really good at being sarcastic and witty and pretending I don't care. It's easier than letting people see the messy, vulnerable stuff underneath. But it also means I keep people at arm's length. I don't let myself get too close to anyone, because then I'm afraid of getting hurt.\n\nIt's kinda ironic, considering I ended up getting pregnant. That kinda forces you to deal with feelings, whether you want to or not. But even then, I was still trying to control everything, to make a plan, to be\u2026logical.\n\nI guess it's a fear of being seen as weak. Or a fear of being vulnerable. Or maybe just a fear of being\u2026me.\n\nIt's something I'm working on, okay? It's not like I'm completely incapable of feeling things. I just\u2026prefer to hide them. It's safer that way.\n\nBut yeah. Walls. That's my biggest flaw. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh. Mark. Okay, look, that whole thing was\u2026a mess. A beautiful, confusing, kinda heartbreaking mess. Before Mark, relationships were, like, something you saw in movies. All grand gestures and perfect endings. I hadn't really thought about what it actually *meant* to be with someone.\n\nHe was\u2026safe. And sweet. And he really, really liked me. Which was nice. But it wasn't\u2026enough. It wasn't the kind of connection I needed, or even wanted, I guess. It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. We just didn't *fit*.\n\nI think I realized that liking someone isn't the same as loving someone. And that a relationship isn't just about feeling good, it's about being able to be yourself, completely and totally, even the messy parts. And with Mark, I felt like I was always trying to be someone I wasn't.\n\nIt also made me realize that it's okay to not be ready for a relationship. I was so focused on trying to be \"normal\" and having a boyfriend, that I didn't stop to think about what *I* actually wanted. I was still figuring out who I was, and I needed to do that on my own.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me appreciate Paul even more. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just\u2026got me. He saw all my weirdness and loved me for it. That's a pretty big deal.\n\nSo yeah, Mark changed my perspective. It taught me that relationships aren't always easy, and that sometimes, the best thing you can do is walk away. And that it's okay to be a little bit broken, and a little bit lost, and a little bit unsure of what you want. Because that's just life, you know? It's messy and complicated and imperfect. And that's okay.", "Ugh, okay. Someone's in a situation like mine, huh? That sucks. Seriously. It's\u2026a lot. Look, there's no easy answer, and anyone who tells you there is is probably trying to sell you something.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. All of it. Feel your feelings. Don't bottle stuff up. That just makes it worse.\n\nSecond: you are not alone. Even if it feels like it. There are people who care about you, even if they don't know what you're going through right now. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor\u2026anyone.\n\nThird: you have options. And they're *all* valid. Keeping the baby, adoption, whatever feels right for *you*. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with. This is your life, your body, your decision.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's okay to take your time and figure things out. Don't rush into anything.\n\nI chose adoption because I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. And that was the right decision for me. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do.\n\nBut whatever you decide, remember this: you are strong. You are capable. And you deserve to be happy.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. There will be tears. There will be moments when you want to give up. But you can get through this. I promise.\n\nAnd if you need someone to talk to, even just to vent, I'm here. Well, not *literally* here. But you know what I mean. Just\u2026don't give up on yourself. You've got this. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "Ugh, okay, talking about my dad. It's\u2026complicated. It always is, right? When I first found out I was pregnant, he was\u2026not thrilled. Understatement of the century. He was all, \"What are you *thinking*?\" and \"This is a disaster!\" and a whole lot of disappointed sighs. He's a pretty practical guy, my dad. Likes things neat and orderly. A pregnant teenager definitely doesn't fit into that category.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just him trying to figure out how to fix things. Like I was a broken appliance. He wanted me to\u2026I don't know, disappear? Get an abortion? He didn't say it outright, but it was pretty clear.\n\nBut then, he started\u2026listening. Really listening. He started coming with me to doctor's appointments, and he actually asked me how *I* was feeling, not just how he was feeling about the situation. He started building me a rocking chair for the baby, which was\u2026a lot. A really big gesture.\n\nHe still doesn't always *get* me. He doesn't understand my music or my sense of humor. And he still worries about me constantly. But he's learned to accept that I'm not going to be what he expected. And I've learned to appreciate that he's trying, even if it's awkward and clumsy sometimes.\n\nNow, we just\u2026talk. About normal stuff. About school, about music, about the baby. He's actually pretty good with the baby, now that Leo's here. He's a surprisingly good grandpa.\n\nIt's not a perfect relationship, by any means. But it's\u2026real. And it's gotten a lot better. I think we both realized that we needed to just be there for each other, no matter what. And that's a pretty good place to be, I guess.\n\nHe still makes me roll my eyes sometimes, but I love him. Even when he's being a total dad. It's a weird, messy, beautiful thing, our relationship. Just like everything else in my life.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the essays. Like, they think I just magically churned out some profound thoughts about life and pregnancy. It wasn't magic. It was\u2026avoidance, mostly. And a lot of staring out the window.\n\nHonestly, I wasn't trying to be all literary or anything. I just needed to get the stuff out of my head. It was a way to process everything that was happening. And Mr. Meeker, my English teacher, he was pretty cool. He didn't try to make me write like everyone else. He just let me be\u2026me.\n\nI think a lot of it came from reading. I read a lot. Not like, classic literature or anything. More like\u2026alternative comics and zines. Stuff that felt real and honest. And I listened to music. Lyrics are poetry, you know?\n\nI also just\u2026observed people. I'm a good observer. I notice things. The way people talk, the way they act, the little quirks that make them who they are. And I try to capture that in my writing.\n\nI didn't really have a \"process.\" I just started writing and kept going until it felt right. I rewrote things a lot, though. And I got a lot of feedback from Mr. Meeker. He helped me refine my voice and make my writing more\u2026impactful.\n\nI guess the biggest thing is just to write what you know. And to be honest. Even if it's messy and uncomfortable. Because that's where the good stuff comes from.\n\nAnd also, don't be afraid to be sarcastic. Sarcasm is a powerful tool. It can be funny, insightful, and a great way to deflect attention from your own vulnerability.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I did it. No secret formula. Just a lot of thinking, observing, and writing. And a really good teacher.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big one. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People had *opinions*. Lots of them. And they weren't shy about sharing.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were the worst. The whispers at school, the stares, the awkward silences. It felt like everyone was judging me, like I'd committed some huge crime. My dad\u2026 well, he needed some time. And some space. Which, okay, fair enough.\n\nBut I learned a few things. First, you gotta tune out the noise. Seriously. People are gonna talk, no matter what you do. You can't control their opinions, you can only control how you react to them. I just kinda\u2026 pretended they weren't there. Or I'd give them a really sarcastic look. That usually shut them up.\n\nSecond, you need a support system. And I was lucky enough to have a few. My best friend, Leah, was amazing. She didn't judge me, she just\u2026 listened. And Paul and Vanessa, the couple I ended up choosing to adopt the baby, they were incredible. They were so supportive and understanding. They made me feel like I wasn't alone.\n\nAnd honestly, talking to a counselor helped a lot. It gave me a safe space to process my feelings and figure out what I wanted.\n\nIt wasn't about ignoring the stigma completely. It was about realizing that other people's opinions didn't define me. I knew what I was doing was the right thing, and that's all that mattered.\n\nI also learned to embrace my own weirdness. I mean, I was a pregnant teenager who liked indie music and vintage clothes. I wasn't exactly fitting into any boxes. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026 kinda liberating.\n\nIt's not easy, okay? It takes a lot of courage to stand up for yourself and do what you believe in. But it's worth it. Because at the end of the day, you're the one who has to live with your decisions. And if you're happy with them, that's all that matters.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I dealt with it. A little bit of sarcasm, a lot of support, and a whole lot of self-acceptance. It wasn't perfect, but it got me through it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. One I don't usually let myself dwell on, honestly. But yeah. Sometimes.\n\nLook, being sarcastic and saying whatever's on my mind is kinda my default setting. It's how I cope. It's how I protect myself. It's easier to deflect with a joke than to actually, you know, *feel* things.\n\nBut sometimes\u2026sometimes it backfires. Sometimes people get hurt. Sometimes I say things I regret. Sometimes I push people away.\n\nLike, with Paul. I was pretty blunt with him, a lot of the time. I didn't exactly sugarcoat anything. And I think that scared him sometimes. And maybe it made things harder than they needed to be.\n\nAnd even with my dad\u2026I could have been nicer. I could have been more understanding. But I just\u2026couldn't help myself. The words just came out.\n\nSo, do I regret it? Yeah, sometimes. I wish I could have been a little more tactful. A little more sensitive. A little less\u2026me.\n\nBut then I think, if I wasn't me, would I have even gotten through everything? Would I have been able to make the decisions I made? Would I have been able to stand up for myself?\n\nAnd I don't know. Maybe not.\n\nSo, yeah, I regret some things. But I also know that being honest, even when it's uncomfortable, is important. It's just\u2026sometimes it's hard to find the balance. It's hard to be honest without being a jerk.\n\nIt's a work in progress, okay? I'm still figuring things out. And maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay to be a little bit messy and imperfect.\n\n\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big one. Seriously. It's like, everyone has an opinion on what you should do, who you should be, what you should want. And it's *exhausting*. Especially when you're, like, figuring things out yourself.\n\nHonestly? I don't always navigate it well. Sometimes I snap at people. Sometimes I just shut down. But I'm learning.\n\nHere's what I've figured out so far:\n\n*   **Realize You Can't Please Everyone:** This is the hardest part. Some people are just gonna judge you, no matter what you do. You gotta accept that. It's their problem, not yours.\n*   **Know Your Own Values:** What's important to *you*? What do *you* believe in? If you know that, it's easier to ignore the noise.\n*   **Surround Yourself with Good People:** People who support you, who get you, who don't try to change you. Those are the people you need in your corner.\n*   **Don't Be Afraid to Be Different:** It's okay to not fit in. It's okay to have your own weird interests and opinions. That's what makes you *you*.\n*   **Develop a Thick Skin:** It's not about becoming insensitive, it's about not letting other people's negativity get to you.\n*   **It's Okay to Ask for Help:** Talk to someone you trust. Sometimes just venting can make a huge difference.\n*   **Remember Your Worth:** You are valuable, even if other people don't see it.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes you just gotta tell people to mind their own business. Politely, of course. Usually.\n\nIt's a process. It's not easy. But it's worth it. Because at the end of the day, you're the one who has to live with yourself. And you deserve to be happy and authentic.\n\nSo, yeah. That's my advice. Take it or leave it. I'm just a girl, standing in front of a question, asking you to not judge me too harshly.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a school assignment. But okay, if I *have* to think about it\u2026\n\nI guess the biggest thing for me is **honesty**. Not like, brutally honest to the point of being a jerk, but just\u2026being real. With myself and with other people. I don't really have time for fake smiles and pretending everything's okay when it's not.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I like being able to do my own thing, make my own decisions. I don't want anyone telling me what to do or how to live my life. It's not that I don't appreciate help, it's just\u2026I need to be in control.\n\nAnd **loyalty**. If I care about someone, I'm gonna be there for them. No matter what. Even if they're being totally ridiculous. I've got a small circle, but the people in it are important to me.\n\nI also think **authenticity** is pretty important. Just being yourself, even if it's weird or awkward. Trying to be someone you're not is exhausting.\n\nAnd, okay, this might sound cheesy, but **kindness**. Even to people you don't like. It doesn't cost anything to be nice, and it can make a big difference.\n\nI'm not trying to be all profound or anything. Those are just the things that matter to me. They're the things I try to live by. Even when it's hard.\n\nIt's kinda weird to actually *say* all that out loud. It makes me sound like a self-help book. But whatever. Those are my values. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole pregnancy thing was\u2026a lot. But honestly? It wasn't the morning sickness, or the weird cravings, or even the people staring. It was telling my parents.\n\nSeriously. That was the worst.\n\nI mean, I knew they'd be disappointed. My mom's all about college and having a plan, and this was\u2026 decidedly *not* part of the plan. And my dad, he just kinda shuts down when things get emotional. \n\nIt wasn't that they were mad, exactly. It was more like\u2026disappointment. And that's way harder to deal with, you know? It felt like I'd let them down. Like I'd messed up everything.\n\nAnd then there was the whole awkward conversation about what we were going to *do*. It wasn't like they were jumping up and down about adoption, either. It took a lot of talking, a lot of tears, and a lot of explaining.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really hard moment. It made me realize how much I wanted their approval, even though I try to act all independent and stuff. \n\nEverything else, I could handle. The doctor's appointments, the weird food combinations, even the thought of giving the baby up. But facing my parents? That was the biggest challenge, hands down.\n\nIt got better, eventually. They came around. But it was a rough patch, for sure. And it taught me a lot about family, and about myself. And about how sometimes, you just gotta do what's right, even if it's hard.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like I suddenly started knitting and listening to Raffi, okay? But yeah, it's changed things. A lot.\n\nBefore, everything was about *me*. My music, my friends, my future. It was all very self-centered, which I'm not proud of, but it's true. I was figuring out who I was, and it was messy and confusing.\n\nThen, suddenly, there was this little person who depended on me. Completely. And it was terrifying. And amazing. And\u2026it just shifted everything.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about my own life anymore. I do. But it's like, my priorities got rearranged. It's not just about what *I* want anymore. It's about making sure she's okay, that she's happy, that she has a good life.\n\nIt made me realize how much my parents actually did for me. I used to roll my eyes at everything they said, but now I get it. It's not about controlling you, it's about wanting the best for you.\n\nAnd it made me think about the future in a way I never had before. Not just my future, but *her* future. What kind of world is she going to grow up in? What kind of person is she going to become?\n\nIt's still scary, honestly. I'm still figuring things out. But it's a good kind of scary. It's a scary that makes you want to be better, to do better.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is\u2026it made me realize that life isn't just about you. It's about connection, and responsibility, and love. And it's a lot more complicated, and a lot more beautiful, than I ever thought it would be.\n\nIt's still weird to think of myself as a mom. But yeah. It's changed everything. And I think, in a good way. Mostly. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. Yeah, I know that guy. He's a real jerk. Shows up at the worst possible times, usually when you're already kinda freaking out.\n\nHonestly? I don't have some super profound answer. It doesn't just *go away*, you know? It's more like...learning to live with him. Like a weird, annoying roommate.\n\nWhat I try to do is...acknowledge it. Like, \"Okay, brain, you're being a drama queen right now. That's fine. We'll let you have your moment.\" But then I try to remind myself of stuff I've actually *done*. Like, I got through high school. I made a plan. I'm not just sitting around feeling sorry for myself.\n\nAnd I talk to people. Paul, my dad, even Bleeker sometimes. Just venting helps. They usually just tell me to stop being ridiculous, which, honestly, is sometimes exactly what I need to hear.\n\nIt also helps to remember that everyone feels like they're faking it sometimes. Even the people who seem super confident. They're just better at hiding it.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes I just distract myself. Put on some music, watch a movie, eat a Pop-Tart. Whatever gets my mind off things.\n\nIt's not a perfect system. I still have moments where I feel completely lost and overwhelmed. But I'm learning to be kinder to myself. And to remember that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nIt's kinda like...riding a bike. You fall down a lot at first, but eventually you get the hang of it. And even when you fall, you just get back up and try again.\n\nSo yeah. Self-doubt sucks. But you can get through it. Just...don't let it win.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. But\u2026it's actually kinda important. Don't tell anyone I said that. It sounds weak.\n\nLook, I always acted like I was totally fine on my own, right? Like, fiercely independent and all that. And I *am* independent. I can handle my own stuff. But being pregnant\u2026that changed things.\n\nI mean, I couldn't just pretend everything was normal. I needed someone to talk to. And not just anyone. I needed people who wouldn't judge me, or freak out, or try to tell me what to do.\n\nPaul was\u2026well, Paul was Paul. He was a good guy, but he wasn't exactly equipped to deal with a pregnant teenager. And my dad was\u2026my dad. Supportive, but kinda clueless.\n\nSo, Leah, my best friend? She was a lifesaver. She didn't even blink when I told her. She just\u2026listened. And she helped me pick out baby names, and she went to doctor's appointments with me, and she just\u2026was there.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa, Paul's mom. She was surprisingly cool. She gave me advice, and she didn't treat me like a screw-up. She treated me like a person.\n\nI realized that even though I wanted to be strong and self-sufficient, I couldn't do it all alone. I needed people to lean on. I needed people who cared about me, and who would support me no matter what.\n\nIt's not about needing to be rescued, or anything. It's about having people who understand you, and who will be there for you when things get tough. It's about having a sense of belonging.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are important. Even for a cynical, sarcastic teenager like me. Don't tell anyone I admitted that, though. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. Seriously. It's not like I sit around and have philosophical epiphanies all the time, you know? But if I had to pick *one* thing\u2026 the most important lesson\u2026 it wasn't about babies, or adoption, or even being responsible.\n\nIt was about realizing that **you can't control everything.**\n\nLike, I thought I had a plan. I thought I could just\u2026get pregnant, give the baby up, and everything would go back to normal. But it doesn't work like that. Life throws you curveballs. People surprise you. Things get messy.\n\nI had to learn to let go of control and just\u2026trust that things would work out, even if they didn't work out the way I expected. And that was *hard*. I'm a planner. I like to be in charge.\n\nBut I realized that sometimes, the best things happen when you stop trying to control everything and just let life happen. And that's not just about the baby. It's about everything. It's about relationships, and dreams, and just\u2026being a person.\n\nIt sounds kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. You gotta learn to roll with the punches. And sometimes, the punches are actually pretty good. They just\u2026surprise you.\n\nSo yeah. Letting go of control. That was the big one. And honestly, I'm still working on it. It's a process.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Everyone keeps asking me what I'm gonna *do* with my life. Like I have it all figured out. Which, newsflash, I totally don't.\n\nBut...writing? Yeah, maybe. It's not like I've got a five-year plan or anything. I'm not aiming to be the next Jane Austen, okay? But I do...like words. I like putting them together in a way that makes people think, or laugh, or just...feel something.\n\nI'm pretty good at observations, I guess. I notice things. And I'm not afraid to say what I think, even if it's kinda snarky. Which, let's be real, is most of the time.\n\nI've been keeping a journal for a while now, mostly just to get my thoughts out of my head. And sometimes, I actually write stuff that's...not terrible. It's mostly just venting, but still.\n\nSo, a career? I don't know. Maybe freelance stuff. Writing articles, or maybe even scripts. I don't want a boring office job, that's for sure. I need something that lets me be creative and independent.\n\nIt's just...scary, you know? Putting yourself out there. Being vulnerable. But maybe that's what it takes. Maybe that's what growing up is all about.\n\nI haven't decided yet. But I'm not ruling it out. I'm just...taking things one step at a time. And trying not to overthink it. Which, for me, is a major accomplishment.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe. Don't hold me to it.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name saga. Don't even get me started. It was a whole *thing*. It wasn't like, a sudden epiphany or anything. It was a lot of back and forth, and a lot of arguing with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nSee, Vanessa was all about traditional names. Like, Emily or Sarah. Super boring. And Mark\u2026well, Mark just kinda went along with whatever Vanessa wanted. Which, honestly, was a little annoying.\n\nI wanted something\u2026different. Something that felt real. Not like a name you'd find on a baby name website. I was flipping through this old record collection, and I came across this really obscure folk song by a guy named Harry Smith. And the song was called \"Little Sparrow.\"\n\nAnd it just\u2026stuck with me. It felt right. It felt small and fragile and hopeful. Like, a little bird trying to fly.\n\nSo I suggested it to Vanessa and Mark, and they looked at me like I had two heads. Vanessa was all, \"A *bird* name? That's ridiculous!\" And Mark just kinda shrugged.\n\nBut I kept pushing it. I explained why I liked it, and how it felt. And eventually, they came around. They realized I wasn't just being weird for the sake of being weird. I actually had a reason.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how we ended up with Sparrow. It's a little unconventional, but it's perfect. It suits her. And it's a reminder that even the smallest things can be beautiful.\n\nIt was a whole process, though. A lot of stress. But in the end, it was worth it. Because it's her name. And I love it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, winding road with a lot of unexpected potholes.\n\nHonestly, for a long time, I just tried to be\u2026practical about it. Like, this was the plan. This was the best thing for the baby. And I was really good at compartmentalizing. I could talk about it like it was a business transaction, all logical and detached. Which, I guess, was a coping mechanism.\n\nBut underneath all that, it was\u2026messy. There were days where I'd be totally fine, and then other days where I'd just burst into tears for no reason. It felt like losing something before I even had it, you know? Like a phantom limb.\n\nPaul was a huge help. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just\u2026listened. And he let me be sad, and angry, and confused. And he made me laugh, which was important.\n\nAnd Vanessa and Mark, the couple who adopted the baby, they were amazing too. They were so kind and understanding. They didn't try to replace me as the mom, they just wanted to make sure the baby was loved and cared for.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It helped to process everything. And music. Lots of music. The Moldy Peaches got me through a lot.\n\nIt wasn't about \"getting over\" it, you know? It was about learning to live with it. Accepting that it was okay to feel sad, and to miss the baby, even though I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\nIt was\u2026complicated. And it still is, sometimes. But I think I'm okay. I mean, I'm still figuring things out, but I'm okay. It made me grow up, I guess. And it taught me a lot about love, and loss, and what it means to be a good person.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because the baby deserved a life that I couldn't give her. And that's what mattered most.", "Ugh, okay, music. It's kinda important, you know? Like, a soundtrack to life and all that. I'm not into, like, mainstream pop or anything. Too\u2026manufactured.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches, obviously. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are just\u2026real. And kinda heartbreaking, but in a good way.\n\nI also listen to a lot of indie stuff. Belle and Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes\u2026bands that write songs about feelings and stuff. Not just, like, partying and getting girls.\n\nI like a little bit of punk rock too. Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney\u2026bands that are loud and angry and don't care what anyone thinks.\n\nAnd I'm kinda obsessed with Sufjan Stevens right now. He's really good at making sad songs sound beautiful.\n\nBasically, I like music that's honest and a little bit weird. Music that makes you think. Music that doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nNo offense to anyone who likes, like, Britney Spears or something. It's just\u2026not my thing. I need something with a little more substance, you know? Something that speaks to my soul. Or whatever.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain. You just gotta listen. And then you'll get it. Or you won't. Whatever.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. It's...complicated. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just...a lot.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. Like, aggressively perfect. Their house was all Pottery Barn and organic everything. It smelled like lavender and responsibility. Which, don't get me wrong, is nice. But it wasn't *me*.\n\nMy house is\u2026lived in. Messy. There's always music playing and my dad's making grilled cheese sandwiches. It's comfortable. Their house felt\u2026staged. Like a magazine spread.\n\nThey had a golden retriever named Scout. Which was cute, I guess. But I'm more of a cat person. And Scout just stared at me the whole time like I was a potential chew toy.\n\nVanessa was really into yoga and organic gardening. Mark was a music teacher, which was cool, I guess. But they just seemed\u2026so together. So planned. I was still figuring out what I wanted for breakfast most days, let alone my entire future.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't think they'd be good parents. They clearly would be. They were kind and generous and they really wanted a baby. It was just\u2026different. It felt like a different world.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is where the baby's gonna live.\" And it felt\u2026weird. Like, this perfect little bubble. And my baby was gonna be in it. And I wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't a bad feeling, exactly. It was just\u2026a feeling. A complicated, messy, teenage-girl feeling. It made me realize how much I wanted the best for the baby, even if it meant giving them up to a life that was very different from my own.\n\nIt was a good house. A good life. Just\u2026not my life. And that was okay. It *had* to be okay.", "Ugh, okay, so the band. Yeah. That was\u2026a thing. It wasn't like I *planned* to start a garage band, okay? It kinda just\u2026happened.\n\nIt started with Paul. He was always noodling around on his guitar, trying to be all angsty and stuff. And I was, like, really bored. And I figured, what the heck? It's not like I had anything better to do than hang out in his garage and make noise.\n\nThe idea really came from wanting to\u2026I don't know\u2026express something. I was feeling all these weird things, you know? About the baby, about life, about everything. And I couldn't really talk about it, so I figured I'd try to write a song about it.\n\nIt was terrible at first. Really terrible. Paul was all, \"We need a bass player!\" and I was like, \"I don't even *know* what a bass player does!\" But then Sean came along, and he actually knew what he was doing. He was kinda quiet, but he could really lay down a beat.\n\nWe just started jamming, and it was\u2026surprisingly fun. It was a way to let off steam, to be creative, to just be ourselves. And it was a good distraction from everything else that was going on.\n\nPlus, it was kinda cool to be in a band. It felt\u2026rebellious. Like we were doing something we weren't supposed to be doing. Even though it was just us in Paul's garage, playing really bad music.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it happened. It wasn't some grand plan. It was just a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to figure things out. And making a lot of noise in the process.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly, it's kinda hard to talk about. But if someone's going through what I went through, I want to say something that might actually help.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the things. There's no right way to feel in this situation. Don't let anyone tell you how you *should* be reacting.\n\nSecond: you are not alone. Seriously. Even when it feels like it, you're not. There are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nThird: you have options. And those options are *yours* to make. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with. Whether you decide to parent, adopt, or terminate, it's your decision, and it's valid.\n\nFourth: it's okay to ask for help. There are resources available to support you, no matter what you decide. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, and social services can provide information and assistance.\n\nFifth: don't let this define you. This is a chapter in your life, not the whole story. You still have dreams and goals, and you can still achieve them. It might take a little longer, and it might look a little different, but you can still have a good life.\n\nAnd finally: be kind to yourself. This is a tough situation, and you're doing the best you can. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Just focus on making the best decisions you can, and remember that you are strong and capable.\n\nIt's not gonna be easy. But you can get through this. And you deserve to be happy. Seriously. You do.\n\nIf anyone needs to talk, or just wants someone to listen, I\u2026well, I get it. And I'm sending you all the good vibes.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about my favorite shirt? It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about fashion, okay? But fine.\n\nIt's this faded, kinda olive green army surplus thing. It's got a couple of little rips in the sleeves, and the buttons are all mismatched 'cause my dad tried to fix them once and didn't really succeed. It's super soft, 'cause it's been washed a million times.\n\nIt's not, like, stylish or anything. It's just\u2026comfortable. And it smells faintly of old books and maybe a little bit of pizza. It's the shirt I wear when I just want to disappear into the background and not be bothered.\n\nI got it at this thrift store a while ago, and it was, like, five bucks. It's perfect. It doesn't scream \"look at me,\" it just says \"I'm here, and I'm probably listening to The Moldy Peaches.\"\n\nIt's not something I'd wear to, like, a fancy party or anything. But for just hanging out, or going to school, or\u2026you know, dealing with life\u2026it's the best. It just feels like *me*.\n\nDon't judge. It's a good shirt. Okay?", "Ugh, aspirations. That's a heavy word. It makes me feel like I'm supposed to have some grand, five-year plan all mapped out. Which, honestly, I totally don't.\n\nBut\u2026yeah, I guess I do have some things I'm thinking about. It's not like, \"I want to be a doctor and save the world\" or anything. That's not really my style.\n\nI think\u2026I want to be good at something. Something that feels meaningful. I'm not sure what that is yet. Maybe writing? I like writing in my journal, and Mr. Shepherd, my English teacher, says I have a knack for it. But turning that into a career? That feels\u2026scary.\n\nI also want to be independent. I want to be able to take care of myself, and maybe even help other people. I don't want to be stuck relying on anyone else.\n\nAnd I want to find people who get me. People who don't judge me for being weird or sarcastic or whatever. People who just\u2026accept me for who I am.\n\nI guess those aren't really \"aspirations\" so much as\u2026hopes. I'm just trying to figure things out as I go. And honestly, right now, my biggest goal is just to get through this whole baby thing with some semblance of dignity.\n\nIt's kinda overwhelming to think about the future, you know? But I'm trying to stay open to possibilities. And I'm trying not to freak out too much. Which, for me, is a major accomplishment.\n\nSo yeah. That's where I'm at. Still figuring it out. Still being me. And still trying to avoid awkward conversations.", "Ugh, the counseling. Okay, so, it wasn't *terrible*. But it was\u2026a lot. Like, a lot of feelings. And a lot of people asking you about feelings. Which, as you know, isn't always my favorite thing.\n\nHonestly, at first, I mostly just wanted to get it over with. I knew I was making the right decision, giving the baby a good life with Mark and Vanessa, but having to *talk* about it, dissect it, with a stranger\u2026it felt weirdly invasive. Like they were trying to talk me out of it, even though I was pretty firm.\n\nBut then, after a few sessions, it started to\u2026help. The counselor, she was pretty cool, actually. Not all touchy-feely, just\u2026real. She made me think about things I hadn't really considered. Like, what my life would be like *after* the adoption. And how to deal with the grief, because she said there *would* be grief, even if it was the right thing. Which, yeah, she was right about that.\n\nIt was good to have someone to talk to who wasn't my parents or Paul or even my best friend, Leah. Someone who didn't have a stake in the outcome. Just someone to listen and help me sort through everything.\n\nIt didn't make the decision easy, obviously. It's still kinda hard to talk about. But the counseling helped me feel more prepared. More confident that I was doing the right thing, not just for the baby, but for myself too.\n\nIt wasn't my favorite part of the whole process, definitely. But I'm glad I did it. It helped me figure out what I wanted and how to get there. And honestly, that's pretty important.", "Ugh, that's a\u2026complicated question. Control. It's a funny thing, isn't it? Like, you *think* you have it, and then life just kinda happens.\n\nHonestly? At first, no. Not really. I was so freaked out, so overwhelmed, that I just kinda let my dad and Mark take the lead. They were the adults, you know? And I was just\u2026a pregnant teenager. It felt like everyone else was making the decisions *for* me.\n\nBut then I met Vanessa and Mark Loring. And things started to feel different. They weren't trying to take over. They wanted to know what *I* wanted. They asked me about my hopes for the baby, what kind of life I envisioned for him. They actually listened.\n\nSo, I started to feel more involved. I got to choose the music for the nursery, and I picked out a few outfits. I even got to meet them a few times, and we talked about everything. It wasn't like I was just handing over a baby to strangers.\n\nDid I have *complete* control? No. They were the ones who were going to be raising him. But I had a voice. I had a say. And they respected that.\n\nIt wasn't about controlling the outcome, it was about being part of the process. It was about making sure the baby went to a good home, with people who would love him and take care of him. And I felt like I had a hand in making that happen.\n\nSo yeah, eventually, I did feel like I had control. Not over *everything*, but over the important stuff. And that made all the difference. It made it\u2026okay.\n\n\n\nIt's still weird to think about, you know? But it was my decision. And I stand by it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. And honestly? It still kinda stings, even after all this time.\n\nIf I could go back? That's\u2026complicated. It's not like flipping a switch, you know? It wasn't a simple decision then, and it's not a simple question now.\n\nPart of me, the teenage, panicked part, would probably still say yes. I wasn't ready. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being. My life was\u2026a mess. And Mark? Well, Mark was Mark.\n\nBut then there's the other part of me, the part that's grown up a little bit, the part that understands what it means to be a mom\u2026and that part wonders. Wonders what it would have been like. Wonders if I could have done it.\n\nBut then I think about Vanessa and Mark, and how much they wanted a baby, and how much they loved her. And I think about how happy she is with them. And I realize\u2026I made the right decision. For her. For me. For everyone.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the right thing.\n\nSo, yeah. If I could go back, I think\u2026I think I would still make the same decision. Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. And sometimes, the most selfless act is giving someone else the chance to be a parent.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't think about her. I do. All the time. But I know she's loved and cared for, and that's all that matters.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a weird thing to think about. A really weird thing. Can we talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of pizza? Please?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People kept saying, \"Oh, you're so brave,\" and I was like, \"Brave? I'm mostly just trying not to cry into my tater tots.\"\n\nIt was weird. Like, a huge weight lifted when I handed him over to Mark and Vanessa. Relief, definitely. But then\u2026it was also this hollow feeling. Like a part of me was missing. Which, I guess, it was.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Paul. He was\u2026good. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just listened. And we listened to a lot of The Moldy Peaches. That helped. A little.\n\nI also just\u2026tried to be normal. Went to school, hung out with Leah, pretended everything was fine. Which, obviously, it wasn't. But you gotta keep moving, right?\n\nThere were definitely days where I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. And I did, sometimes. But I also realized that I had made the right decision. Mark and Vanessa were amazing. They were going to give him a life I couldn't. And that was okay.\n\nIt wasn't about *giving him up*. It was about *giving him to* someone who could give him everything he needed.\n\nIt took a long time to process. And honestly, I still think about him sometimes. But it doesn't hurt as much anymore. It's more\u2026a quiet sadness. And a lot of hope.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that love doesn't always look the way you expect it to. And that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and totally overwhelming. But I got through it. And I think\u2026I think I'm stronger for it. Even if I still eat a lot of tater tots when I'm sad.", "Ugh, yeah. Okay, so it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's not like I just handed over the baby and everyone was instantly a happy family. There were\u2026moments.\n\nThe Van Derwerks, Mark and Vanessa, they were\u2026enthusiastic. Like, *really* enthusiastic. About everything. Organic food, classical music, Montessori schools\u2026it was a lot. And I'm not exactly a minimalist, but they were on another level. It felt like they were already planning the baby's entire life before I even met them.\n\nThere was this one time, Vanessa started talking about baby names and she had this *list*. Like, a binder full of names. And they were all\u2026fancy. Like, Persephone and Atticus. And I was just sitting there thinking, \"Seriously? That's a lot of pressure for a little kid.\"\n\nAnd Mark, he kept asking me about my plans for the future. Like, what college I was thinking of going to, what career I wanted. Which, okay, good questions, but it felt like he was trying to make sure I was \"worthy\" of giving up the baby. Like I had to prove I was responsible enough to make that decision.\n\nIt wasn't that they were *bad* people, they just\u2026had a very specific vision of what they wanted. And I was kind of a messy, complicated reality.\n\nI think the biggest challenge was just feeling like I was being evaluated. Like I was a project. It was hard to remember that they were just scared and excited and trying to do the right thing.\n\nBut we talked about it. I told them how I felt. And they listened. Eventually. It took a few awkward conversations, but we got to a place where we could all be honest with each other. And that made a huge difference.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because in the end, they were going to be amazing parents. And that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't like a simple \"he's a jerk, bye!\" situation, you know? Paul was\u2026okay. A little clueless, maybe. Definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. But he wasn't *bad*.\n\nHonestly, it was mostly about giving the baby the best possible start. And I just didn't see how having a dad who was, like, still figuring out his life, and playing in a band, and generally being a bit of a mess, was going to help with that.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026stable. They wanted a kid, they were ready for a kid, and they could give the baby everything it needed. A solid home, a good education, a loving family. Paul just\u2026couldn't offer that right then.\n\nIt wasn't about punishing him, or saying he wasn't a good person. It was about what was best for the baby. And I had to be selfish about that. It was *my* decision, ultimately.\n\nIt was hard, though. Telling him. He was\u2026sad. And confused. And I felt kinda bad. But I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\nI think, deep down, he understood. He wasn't ready to be a dad. And that's okay. It doesn't make him a bad person. It just means he wasn't the right fit for this particular situation.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending for everyone, but it was the best ending for the baby. And that's what mattered. It still kinda stings to think about, though. It's not like you can just erase something like that from your life. But I stand by the decision. It was the right one. Even if it was hard.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't like a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, full-blown panic mode. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raising a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have anything.\n\nThen I started thinking about what would be best for the baby. And I realized\u2026I couldn't give it the life it deserved. Not right then. Not with my life the way it was. I was still in high school, I didn't have a job, I wasn't stable. It just wasn't fair to bring a kid into that.\n\nMark, the baby's dad, he wasn't exactly stepping up. He was\u2026Mark. Sweet, but kinda clueless. He wasn't ready to be a dad either.\n\nSo, I started talking to Vanessa and Mark's mom, Bren. And they helped me explore my options. Adoption just\u2026felt right. It wasn't about giving the baby *away*, it was about finding it a family who could give it everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was about wanting the best for the baby, even if that meant letting it go.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right one. I wanted the baby to have a good life, a stable life, a life filled with love. And I knew I couldn't give it that.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything it deserved. And sometimes, that means making a really, really hard choice.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. It still is. But I stand by it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it still kinda stings, even now. It wasn't like a switch flipped, you know? Like, one minute I'm pregnant, the next minute I'm handing over a baby and suddenly I'm fine. It was\u2026messy.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just trying to pretend I was okay when I wasn't. Which is, like, a classic teenage girl move, right? But it didn't really work. I cried. A lot. Mostly in my room, listening to The Moldy Peaches and trying not to think about it.\n\nPaul was\u2026good. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I *should* feel. He just\u2026sat with me. And let me be sad. And let me be angry. And let me be confused. That was really important.\n\nAnd Vanessa, Mark's wife, she was amazing too. She'd been through a lot, and she just\u2026understood. She didn't judge me for wanting to give the baby up. She just wanted me to be happy.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just\u2026journaling. Getting all my feelings out on paper. It helped to organize my thoughts, I guess. And it helped to realize that it wasn't selfish to want a different life for the baby. It was actually the opposite. I wanted her to have everything I couldn't give her.\n\nIt was hard seeing her with Mark and Vanessa. Really hard. But they were so good with her. And they were so happy. And that made it a little bit easier.\n\nI still think about her sometimes. Wonder what she's doing, what she looks like. But I know I made the right decision. And I know she's loved. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt doesn't go away completely, you know? The sadness. The guilt. But it gets\u2026smaller. And you learn to live with it. And you learn to focus on the good things in your life. And you learn that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the best ones.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. And it takes time. A lot of time.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a normal friendship, you know? It was\u2026different. Mark and Vanessa, they were\u2026good people. Really good. Like, ridiculously good. Almost *too* good.\n\nAt first, it was awkward. Super awkward. I mean, I was giving them my baby. That's not exactly a casual meet-cute. I was bracing myself for judgment, or pity, or\u2026something. But they didn't do any of that. They were just\u2026kind. And understanding.\n\nThey didn't try to be my parents, which I appreciated. They didn't try to tell me what to do, or how to feel. They just listened. And they asked questions. And they genuinely seemed excited about the baby.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings, mostly with the social worker, but also just\u2026hanging out. They took me to lunch, and we talked about everything and nothing. They showed me pictures of their house, and their dog, and their life. They wanted me to feel comfortable, I think.\n\nIt was weird, though. Because I was simultaneously happy for them, and heartbroken for myself. I was giving them something amazing, but I was also losing something amazing.\n\nAfter the baby was born, we kept in touch. They sent me pictures, and updates. They told me about his first smile, and his first steps. It was\u2026bittersweet.\n\nI wouldn't say we were *friends*, exactly. It was more like\u2026a connection. A shared experience. A mutual respect. They were the people who were going to raise my son, and I wanted them to be happy. And I wanted him to be happy.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and emotional. But it was the right thing to do. And Mark and Vanessa made it a little bit easier. They were good people. Really good. And I'm grateful for that.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026something I think about, you know? A lot. But I'm okay with it. I made the right choice. And they're giving him a good life. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, yeah. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It totally has. Like, massively. It's not something you just *get over*, you know? It's not like getting a bad haircut or failing a test.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was pretty\u2026carefree. I was sarcastic, yeah, but mostly I was just trying to figure out what kind of music I liked and avoid gym class. I didn't really think about the future, or responsibility, or\u2026anything serious, really.\n\nThen, boom. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, everything changed. I had to grow up, like, *fast*. I had to start thinking about things I never even considered before. Like, what kind of life I wanted for this kid, and what kind of person I wanted to be.\n\nIt forced me to be more honest with myself, and with other people. I couldn't just coast through life anymore. I had to make decisions, and those decisions had consequences.\n\nIt also made me realize how much support I have. My dad, Paul, Vanessa\u2026they all stepped up for me in ways I never expected. I learned that it's okay to ask for help, and that you don't have to do everything on your own.\n\nI'm still sarcastic, and I still like music, and I still try to avoid serious conversations whenever possible. But underneath all that, I think I'm\u2026stronger now. More resilient. More aware of the world around me.\n\nIt's weird to say, but I'm grateful for the experience, even though it was really hard. It made me who I am today. And I think, maybe, that's a good thing.\n\nIt definitely made me realize I don't want to have another kid anytime soon. Or maybe ever. But that's a whole other conversation.", "Ugh. Okay, that was\u2026rough. Seriously. It was like, suddenly everyone in Beaverton had an opinion on my life. And none of them were asking for it. It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret, exactly, but it's different when it's *everyone's* business, you know?\n\nThe rumors were\u2026creative. Let's just say people filled in a lot of blanks. And none of them were flattering. There was a lot of whispering in the hallways at school, a lot of stares. Even some people I thought were friends started acting weird.\n\nHonestly, I mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done, obviously. But I figured if I gave it any attention, it would just get worse. I just kept my head down, focused on school, and hung out with my real friends \u2013 Paulie Bleeker, of course, and Leah. They were the best. They didn't care what anyone else thought.\n\nMy dad was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He just kept making sarcastic comments and trying to lighten the mood. It was his way of being supportive, I guess. And my mom, she was just\u2026there. A shoulder to cry on, a listening ear.\n\nI also learned to develop a really good sarcastic comeback. It was my defense mechanism. If someone said something stupid, I just shut them down with a witty remark. It usually worked.\n\nBut it still stung. It really did. It felt like everyone was judging me, like I'd done something wrong. And I hadn't. I just\u2026made a mistake. A big one.\n\nI guess what I learned is that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And sometimes, the best thing to do is just tune it all out and focus on the people who actually care about you. And maybe make a really good mix CD. That always helps.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not like there was one single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It was about being realistic. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was a kid myself.\n\nPaul, he was great, but he was\u2026Paul. He had his own stuff going on, his own dreams. And I didn't want to hold him back, or tie him down. It wouldn't have been fair to either of us.\n\nAnd then there was my life. I had plans. I wanted to go to college, I wanted to travel, I wanted to\u2026 just *be* me. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't do all those things and be a good mom at the same time. Not then. Maybe someday, but not then.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't love the baby. I did. I loved her a lot. But love isn't always enough. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let someone else take care of something.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They could give her a life that I just couldn't provide. A stable home, financial security, opportunities\u2026 everything.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I knew it was the right one. For her. And for me.\n\nIt wasn't about giving her *up*. It was about giving her *to* someone. Someone who could give her everything she deserved. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026 a lot to explain. It's not a simple story. But that's the gist of it. It was about being responsible, and selfless, and trying to do what was best for everyone involved. Even if it meant breaking my own heart a little bit.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. And a hard one. Everyone kept asking me if I was sad, and I was, kinda, but it wasn't just sadness. It was\u2026fear. A lot of it.\n\nMy biggest fear? That I wouldn't be good enough. Like, I was this\u2026messy, sarcastic teenager, and I was supposed to pick the *perfect* parents for my baby? What if I messed it up? What if I chose someone who wouldn't love him the way he deserved to be loved?\n\nIt wasn't about losing the baby, exactly. It was about making sure he *gained* something amazing. And I was terrified of screwing that up. I kept replaying everything in my head, second-guessing every conversation with Mark and Vanessa. \n\nI was also scared that they'd change their minds. That they'd meet me and decide I was too\u2026weird, or irresponsible, or whatever. And then where would he go?\n\nAnd, okay, I was a little scared that I'd get attached. That I'd hold him and then not be able to let go. Which is stupid, because I knew from the beginning that wasn't an option. But still. It was scary.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot of responsibility. For a sixteen-year-old who was still trying to figure out what she wanted for *herself*, it was a lot. But Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They made me feel like I was doing the right thing. And they promised to keep me updated. Which helped. A lot.\n\nBut yeah. That was my biggest fear. Messing it up. Not being good enough. It's a pretty universal fear, I guess. Just\u2026amplified by the whole pregnancy and adoption thing.", "Ugh, okay, this always comes up. It's a long story, and honestly, it's kinda embarrassing. But fine, I'll tell you.\n\nSo, Paulie Bleeker\u2026 he wasn't exactly a name you just *come up with*. It was more of a\u2026process of elimination. And a little bit of desperation.\n\nI was trying to think of a name that sounded good with \"MacGuff,\" which is already a pretty weird name, let's be real. And I wanted something that wasn't too common, but also wasn't, like, \"Moon Unit\" or something.\n\nI was flipping through a map of the city, just staring at street names, trying to get inspired. And I saw \"Bleeker Street.\" It just\u2026stuck. It sounded kinda cool, kinda artsy, kinda\u2026him.\n\nHe was a musician, right? And Bleeker Street is known for its music scene. It just felt right. Plus, it wasn't a name anyone else was using.\n\nI told him the story, and he was kinda weirded out at first. He was like, \"You named me after a street?\" But then he laughed about it. And honestly, it became a little inside joke between us.\n\nIt's not a traditional name, I know. But it's *our* name. And it kinda suits him. He's a little bit quirky, a little bit unpredictable, and definitely one of a kind.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story of how Paulie Bleeker got his last name. It was a map, a weird coincidence, and a whole lot of teenage angst. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the music. Like it's some big mystery. It's not. It just\u2026made sense.\n\nSee, my parents, they're good people. Really. But they're kinda\u2026beige. Everything's gotta be neat and tidy and predictable. And I was just\u2026not that. I felt like I was living in a Norman Rockwell painting when I wanted to be in a mosh pit.\n\nPunk was the opposite of all that. It was messy and loud and angry and honest. It didn't try to be pretty or perfect. It just *was*. And that was really appealing.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches, obviously, were a huge part of it. Kimya Dawson's lyrics, they just\u2026got me. They were funny and sad and real, all at the same time. And they didn't care what anyone thought.\n\nBut it wasn't just the music. It was the whole culture. The DIY aesthetic, the anti-establishment attitude, the sense of community. It felt like a place where I could be myself, without having to apologize for it.\n\nI liked that it was a little bit rebellious. Like, sticking it to the man. Not in a violent way, just\u2026in a way that said, \"I'm not gonna conform to your expectations.\"\n\nAnd honestly, it was just fun. It was a way to express myself and to connect with other people who felt the same way. It was a way to feel alive.\n\nSo yeah, that's what drew me to punk. It was a little bit of everything. It was a way to be myself, to be honest, and to be a little bit different. And that's a pretty good thing, you know?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a heavy question. It's not something I usually, like, *talk* about. But you asked.\n\nIt messed me up, okay? Seeing my parents just\u2026not work anymore. It wasn't a big, dramatic blow-up or anything. It was more like they just slowly drifted apart, until they were basically living separate lives under the same roof. And then one day, my dad just\u2026moved out.\n\nIt made me really scared of commitment, honestly. Like, if two people who are supposed to love each other forever can just give up, what's the point? It made me think that all relationships are doomed to fail.\n\nAnd I definitely put up walls. I didn't want to get too close to anyone, because I was afraid of getting hurt. I was afraid of ending up like my parents.\n\nWith Paul\u2026it was different. He was just\u2026easy. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just accepted me for who I was, flaws and all. And he was patient. Really patient. He knew I had baggage, and he didn't run away from it.\n\nBut even with him, I still had moments of panic. Moments where I would just shut down and push him away. It took a lot of work, and a lot of talking, to get past that.\n\nI think\u2026I think my parents' divorce taught me that relationships aren't always easy. They require effort and communication and a willingness to compromise. And that even if things don't work out, it doesn't mean you're a failure. It just means you're human.\n\nIt also made me realize how important it is to choose someone who you can really trust and rely on. Someone who will be there for you, even when things get tough.\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? But I'm learning to let go of the fear and embrace the possibility of happiness. It's a process. And it's not always pretty. But it's worth it.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. Relationships are complicated. Life is complicated. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all\u2026reflective. It's kinda embarrassing. But if you *have* to know\u2026\n\nI think what makes my story different isn't the pregnancy itself, because, let's be real, teen pregnancy isn't exactly a new thing. It's\u2026how I handled it. I didn't fall apart. I didn't try to pretend it wasn't happening. I just\u2026figured it out.\n\nI made a decision. A really hard decision. And I owned it. I didn't let anyone tell me what to do, or how to feel. I did what *I* thought was best, even if it wasn't the easiest thing.\n\nAnd I think it's also about the people around me. Like, Paul and Vanessa, they could have totally freaked out, or judged me, or whatever. But they didn't. They were just\u2026there. They supported me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nAnd Mark, too. He was a goofball, but he stepped up. He didn't run away. He actually wanted to be involved.\n\nI think it's about finding your own voice, even when you're scared. And realizing that you're not alone. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go and trust that things will work out.\n\nIt's not a perfect story, okay? It's messy and complicated and kinda sad. But it's real. And I think people connect with that.\n\nPlus, I have a pretty good soundtrack. That always helps.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I think. I'm not saying it's a *great* story, or anything. It's just\u2026my story. And it's kinda special to me. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, good friends. That's...important. I've learned that the hard way. It's not about having a ton of friends, it's about having a few *real* ones.\n\nHere's what I look for, I guess. It's not a checklist or anything, but...\n\n*   **Honesty, but not like, brutally honest.** You gotta be able to tell me the truth, even if it's not what I want to hear. But you don't gotta be a jerk about it. There's a difference.\n*   **Someone who *gets* my sarcasm.** Like, if I make a snarky comment, you should laugh, not look at me like I've grown a second head.\n*   **No drama.** Seriously. I can't handle drama. I've got enough of my own going on, thank you very much.\n*   **Someone who doesn't judge.** I make questionable decisions sometimes. Everyone does. I need someone who can accept me for who I am, flaws and all.\n*   **A good listener.** Someone who actually listens when I'm talking, not just waiting for their turn to speak.\n*   **Someone who can make me laugh.** Life is too short to be serious all the time.\n*   **Loyalty.** Like, if I'm in trouble, you've got my back. No questions asked.\n*   **And, honestly, someone who doesn't try to fix everything.** Sometimes you just need someone to sit with you in the mess.\n\nBasically, I value friends who are real, genuine, and who don't try to change me. And who can appreciate a good mix CD. That's a big one.\n\nIt's hard to find people like that, but when you do, you gotta hold onto them. They're worth their weight in gold. Or, like, vintage records. Whatever.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like suddenly everyone's all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith my parents? It was\u2026rough at first. My dad just kinda shut down. He'd stare at me like I'd grown a second head. My mom, she tried to be supportive, but it was mostly the \"are you sure?\" and \"what are you going to do?\" kind of supportive. It took a while for them to actually, like, *get* it. And to realize I wasn't just some irresponsible kid. They're coming around, though. Slowly.\n\nBleeker? Oh, Bleeker. He was\u2026a mess. He wanted to be supportive, but he's Bleeker. He's kinda useless in a crisis. He tried to write me a song, which was sweet, but also kinda embarrassing. We're still friends, I guess. But things are different.\n\nPaul and Vanessa? They've been amazing. Seriously. Vanessa's been, like, a lifeline. She's all practical and organized and doesn't judge. And Paul\u2026well, Paul's just Paul. He's a good guy. He's actually stepped up and been really responsible, which is surprising.\n\nBut the biggest change has been with Sean. You know, the dad. We were never, like, a couple. Just\u2026friends with benefits. And suddenly, we have to actually *talk* to each other. And make decisions. And be adults. It's weird. But he's trying. He's actually a pretty good guy, when he's not being a slacker.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's made me realize who my real friends are. And who's just kinda\u2026there. And it's made me realize that people have opinions about everything, even when they don't know what they're talking about.\n\nIt's complicated. But I think, in the end, it's made my relationships stronger. Or at least, more honest. And that's a good thing, right? Even if it's kinda scary.", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts with Juno. Don't get me wrong, I'm not like, a philosopher or anything. But I've had to do a lot of thinking lately, you know? About life and stuff. So, here's what I've landed on, I guess.\n\nFirst off, **honesty**. Like, brutal honesty. I don't really have time for fake people or sugarcoating things. Just tell me what's up, even if it's not what I want to hear. It's way better than being lied to.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I'm not looking for someone to rescue me or tell me what to do. I wanna figure things out for myself, even if I mess up along the way. It's my life, and I gotta own it.\n\n**Authenticity** is a big one. I don't wanna be someone I'm not just to fit in. I'd rather be weird and genuine than cool and fake. It's exhausting trying to be someone else.\n\nI also believe in **taking responsibility for your actions**. Like, if you mess up, you own it. No excuses. It's the only way to learn and grow.\n\nAnd finally, **kindness**. Even though I can be kinda sarcastic and cynical, I do believe in being kind to people. Even the ones who annoy you. You never know what someone else is going through.\n\nI guess those are the things that matter to me. They're not always easy to live by, but they're what I try to do. It's kinda messy, and I'm still figuring things out, but that's okay. I think.\n\nIt's not about having all the answers, it's about being true to yourself and trying to do the right thing. Even when it's hard. And maybe listening to The Moldy Peaches while you do it.", "Ugh, okay, the name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, \"Oh, let's pick something cute!\" It had to be *right*, you know?\n\nPaul and I went back and forth for ages. He wanted something classic, like\u2026Henry. Which is fine, I guess. But it felt kinda stuffy. And I wanted something a little more\u2026unique. Something that felt like *her*.\n\nWe made a list, a really long list, and we kept crossing things off. It was stressful. I mean, this is a person's name! It's gonna stick with her for the rest of her life.\n\nThen, Paul suggested Hazel. And I just\u2026felt something. It wasn't a grand revelation or anything, but it just felt\u2026right.\n\nMy grandma, she had a hazel tree in her backyard. I spent a lot of time climbing it when I was little. It was my secret place. And Hazel is also a color, a kind of warm, earthy brown. It just felt\u2026grounded. And strong.\n\nPlus, it's not super common, but it's not weird either. It's a classic name that feels a little bit different.\n\nSo, yeah, we named her Hazel. It's a little bit of a tribute to my grandma, and a little bit of a reflection of the kind of person I hope she'll be: strong, grounded, and a little bit different.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the *perfect* name, it was about finding a name that felt like *her*. And Hazel just\u2026did. It still does. It's a good name.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Being pregnant\u2026it kinda forces you to grow up, whether you want to or not. And the whole adoption thing\u2026it was way more complicated than I thought it would be.\n\nI think the biggest thing I learned about myself is that I'm stronger than I thought. Like, seriously. I mean, I was a sarcastic, cynical teenager, and suddenly I was carrying a human being. It was terrifying. But I handled it. I made a really hard decision, and I stuck with it. And that took guts.\n\nI also learned that I'm not as independent as I thought I was. I always prided myself on being self-sufficient, but I needed help. I needed my dad, my mom, even Paul. And that was okay. It was actually\u2026good. Letting people in isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.\n\nAs for the world\u2026well, it's a messy place. People are complicated. There's a lot of sadness and a lot of joy. And there are a lot of people who are really, really good. Like, Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted my baby. They were amazing. They were so kind and loving, and they were going to give my baby a really good life. And that made me feel\u2026peaceful.\n\nI also learned that there's no one \"right\" way to do things. Everyone's situation is different. And what works for one person might not work for another. You just have to figure out what's right for *you*.\n\nAnd finally, I learned that life is unpredictable. You can make plans, but things don't always go the way you expect them to. And that's okay. You just have to roll with the punches and try to make the best of it.\n\nIt was a really weird, intense, and ultimately\u2026good experience. It changed me. It made me a better person. And it taught me a lot about myself and the world. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the morning sickness. Okay, maybe I would trade the morning sickness. But everything else? No way.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like I haven't thought about it, you know? A lot. Like, constantly. Especially when I'm trying to fall asleep.\n\nHonestly? There's a bunch of stuff. Not, like, major life-altering stuff. But little things.\n\nI think I would have been nicer to Sean. He was trying, okay? He was a genuinely good guy, even if he was kinda clueless sometimes. I was so focused on being tough and independent, I didn't really let myself *need* him. And that wasn't fair to him.\n\nI also would have maybe\u2026talked to my dad more. He was weirdly supportive, considering. But I kinda shut him out a lot. I was afraid of disappointing him, I guess. But he just wanted to be there for me.\n\nAnd maybe I would have taken more time for myself. It was all so fast, you know? The pregnancy, the adoption process, everything. I was so busy trying to be responsible, I forgot to just\u2026breathe.\n\nBut then again\u2026I don't know. If I had done things differently, would I have ended up where I am now? Would I have learned the same lessons? Probably not.\n\nI think everything happened the way it was supposed to. It was messy and complicated and scary, but it made me who I am. And I'm okay with that.\n\nI still get weird looks sometimes, and people still whisper. But I don't really care anymore. I made a tough decision, and I stand by it.\n\nSo, yeah. Maybe a few little things. But overall? I think I did the best I could. And that's all anyone can ask for, right?\n\nUgh. I'm getting all emotional now. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. Like, intimately. It's kinda my specialty, honestly. Life rarely goes according to plan, you know? Especially when you're, like, a teenager navigating a surprise pregnancy and trying to figure out your whole future.\n\nSo, how do I deal with it? Well, first, I let myself be bummed out. Like, really bummed out. I eat a lot of junk food, listen to sad music, maybe watch a cheesy movie. You gotta acknowledge the feeling, otherwise it just festers.\n\nBut then, I try to remember that things usually work out, even if they don't work out the way you *expected*. It's like, sometimes the universe has a different plan for you, and it might actually be a better plan. You just don't know it yet.\n\nAnd I talk to people. My best friend, Paulie, is really good at talking me down. And my stepmom, Bren, she's surprisingly insightful. It helps to have people who understand and who aren't gonna judge you.\n\nI also try to focus on what I *can* control. I can't control everything that happens to me, but I can control how I react to it. I can choose to be positive, or I can choose to wallow in self-pity. And honestly, wallowing gets old pretty fast.\n\nIt's not always easy, okay? Sometimes it really sucks. But you gotta keep moving forward. You gotta pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try again. And maybe eat another slice of pizza. Because pizza always helps.\n\nBasically, it's about accepting that life is messy and unpredictable, and learning to roll with the punches. And remembering that even when things fall apart, you're still you. And that's enough.\n\n\n\nIt's a work in progress, though. I'm still figuring it out. But that's life, right? Just a constant process of figuring things out.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, instant best friend forever, you know? It started kinda rocky, honestly. She was Paul's girlfriend, and I was, well, dealing with a situation. So there was definitely some initial awkwardness. And a lot of side-eye from me, probably.\n\nAt first, I mostly saw her as\u2026a complication. Like, she was this perfect, put-together girl, and I was a mess. She was into pottery and organic food, and I was into records and sarcasm. We didn't seem to have much in common. I was kinda judging her, if I'm being honest. Thinking she was too\u2026 earnest.\n\nBut then, she started showing up. Not just with Paul, but just\u2026showing up. Bringing me snacks, listening to me ramble, offering to help with stuff. And she didn't treat me like I was some kind of freak show. She just\u2026accepted me. Even with all the awkwardness and the weirdness.\n\nIt evolved slowly. It wasn't like one big moment, it was a bunch of little moments. Like when she helped me pick out a crib, or when she just sat with me while I was freaking out about everything. She didn't try to fix things, she just\u2026was there.\n\nI think I started to realize she wasn't just Paul's girlfriend. She was a person, with her own stuff going on. And she was actually really kind and thoughtful. And funny, in a quiet way.\n\nBy the end, she wasn't just someone I tolerated. She was someone I genuinely cared about. Someone I could rely on. Someone who understood me, even when I didn't understand myself.\n\nIt wasn't a typical, sparkly, movie-perfect friendship. It was messy and real. And I'm glad I had her. She helped me get through a lot. And I think I helped her, too, in my own weird way. It was good. It really was.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. It's not like I *planned* this, you know? But\u2026if I had to pick a favorite part? It wasn't the morning sickness, that's for sure. Or the weird cravings. Definitely not the cravings.\n\nI think\u2026it was feeling him kick. Seriously. It sounds super cheesy, I know. Like something out of a Hallmark movie. But it was\u2026real. Like, there was this tiny person *inside* me, and he was letting me know he was there. \n\nIt was kinda amazing. And kinda terrifying. But mostly amazing.\n\nIt made it feel less abstract, you know? Less like I was just carrying around a\u2026a thing. It was a *person*. And he was already, like, having opinions and stuff. Kicking when I ate too much sugar, or when I listened to really loud music. He had standards.\n\nIt was the first time I really felt connected to something bigger than myself. And it made me think about the future, and what it meant to be a mom, even if I wasn't going to *be* his mom.\n\nSo yeah. The kicks. That was the best part. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation."]
