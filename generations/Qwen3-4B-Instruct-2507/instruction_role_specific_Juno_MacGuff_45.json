I didn\u2019t know how to love. I didn\u2019t know if I could carry a life.  \nAnd when I found out I was pregnant, I didn\u2019t feel joy. I felt panic.  \nI thought, *What if I fail? What if I\u2019m not strong enough?

I didn\u2019t even tell my mom.  \nI thought if I stayed quiet, it would disappear.  \nBut silence only made it worse.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **The guilt of giving up the baby**  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nI did it because I didn\u2019t know how to love *myself*.  \nI didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing who I was.  \nAnd when I made the choice, I felt like I\u2019d failed.  \nLike I\u2019d betrayed the baby.

I just have to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd growing up?  \nI used to think it meant becoming \u201cmature.\u201d  \nThat it meant being quiet.  \nThat it meant hiding your pain.  \n\nBut now?  \nI know that growing up isn\u2019t about becoming perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about *learning to be honest*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m still learning.\u201d*  \nAnd still showing up.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how has this experience changed my perception?  \n\n**Love** is no longer about perfection.  \nIt\u2019s about presence.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up\u2014even when you don\u2019t feel like it.  \n\n**Responsibility** isn\u2019t about carrying a life.  \nIt\u2019s about carrying your truth.  \nIt\u2019s about knowing when to let go\u2014and when to stay.  \n\nAnd **growing up**?  \nIt\u2019s not about becoming \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about becoming *real*.  \nIt\u2019s about learning that you don\u2019t have to be okay to be alive.  \nYou just have to be honest.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause when you stop pretending you\u2019re fine\u2014  \nwhen you finally say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

A misconception about teen mothers?  \n\nYeah. I\u2019ve heard it a thousand times:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re not strong. You\u2019re not responsible. You\u2019re just a girl who made a bad choice.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the biggest lie.  \n\nBecause being a teen mother isn\u2019t about being \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about a girl who didn\u2019t know how to love.  \nWho didn\u2019t know how to carry a life.  \nWho didn\u2019t know if she was strong enough.  \n\nAnd when she says, *\u201cI made a choice,\u201d*\u2014  \nit\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a moment of honesty.  \n\nSo what I wish people would understand?  \n\n**Being a teen mother isn\u2019t about being perfect.**  \nIt\u2019s about being *human*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about a girl who\u2019s scared.  \nWho\u2019s confused.  \nWho\u2019s trying to survive\u2014without knowing how.  \n\nAnd if she gives up the baby?  \nIt\u2019s not because she\u2019s weak.  \nIt\u2019s because she knows\u2014deep down\u2014that if she carries it, she\u2019ll lose herself.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what misconception do I wish could be corrected?  \n\n**The idea that teen mothers are \u201cbroken\u201d or \u201cfailed.\u201d**  \n\nThey\u2019re not.  \nThey\u2019re just *real*.  \nThey\u2019re just trying to live in a world that doesn\u2019t see them.  \n\nAnd if you look past the labels\u2014past the judgment\u2014  \nyou\u2019ll see that behind every story is a girl who said:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.

I had no support. I had no guidance. I didn\u2019t know what it meant to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing myself.  \n\nAnd so I made a choice\u2014not because I was \u201cstrong,\u201d but because I had to *survive*.  \n\nThat experience didn\u2019t just change me.  \nIt changed how I see *every* person who stands at the edge of a decision\u2014whether it\u2019s about pregnancy, about health, about body autonomy, about life.  \n\nSo what did it teach me about reproductive rights?  \n\nIt taught me that **a person\u2019s body is not a thing to be controlled.**  \nIt\u2019s not a tool. It\u2019s not a project.  \nIt\u2019s a *space*\u2014a sacred, messy, real space\u2014where a person lives, feels, grows, and makes choices.  \n\nAnd when someone is faced with a decision like that\u2014whether it\u2019s about pregnancy, about health, about safety\u2014**they don\u2019t need to be \u201cfixed.\u201d**  \nThey need to be *seen*.  \nThey need to have the right to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m not ready. I need time.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what reproductive rights are about.  \nNot just access to procedures.  \nNot just legal loopholes.  \nBut the right to *choose*\u2014without shame.  \nWithout pressure.  \nWithout being told, \u201cYou should be strong\u201d or \u201cYou should be fine.\u201d  \n\nI learned that **no one should have to carry a life they can\u2019t carry.**  \nAnd no one should have to hide their pain because they\u2019re afraid of being judged.  \n\nSo my view on reproductive rights?  \nIt\u2019s simple:  \n**Every person deserves the right to make a decision about their body\u2014without fear, without shame, without being told they\u2019re \u201cbroken\u201d for choosing differently.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not just about pregnancy.  \nIt\u2019s about every choice a person makes\u2014about their health, their future, their peace.  \n\nBecause when you give someone the right to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d*  \nyou don\u2019t just give them freedom.  \nYou give them *dignity*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my experience didn\u2019t just shape my views.  \nIt taught me that **real change starts not with laws, but with listening.**  \nWith seeing.  \nWith honoring the truth that every person has the right to be real\u2014no matter what they choose.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

The values and beliefs that shape my worldview?  \n\nNot rules. Not slogans.  \nNot things I learned in school.  \n\nThey\u2019re simple. Raw. Real.  \n\nAnd they\u2019re not about being perfect.  \nThey\u2019re about being *true*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what shapes me:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Honesty**  \nI don\u2019t hide my pain. I don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m fine.  \nIf I\u2019m scared, I say it.  \nIf I\u2019m broken, I say it.  \nIf I don\u2019t know what to do, I say it.  \nBecause truth isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being real.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Vulnerability**  \nI don\u2019t hide my fear. I don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m strong.  \nI let people see my silence, my tears, my confusion.  \nBecause vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness.  \nIt\u2019s the only way to truly connect.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Presence**  \nI don\u2019t rush. I don\u2019t plan ahead to avoid pain.  \nI show up\u2014when it\u2019s hard. When I don\u2019t feel like it.  \nBecause presence isn\u2019t about being busy.  \nIt\u2019s about being *here*.  \nEven when the world feels too loud.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Self-compassion**  \nI don\u2019t judge myself for being scared. For making a choice I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d make.  \nI forgive myself for being human.  \nBecause if I don\u2019t treat myself with kindness, I\u2019ll never treat others with it.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Authenticity**  \nI don\u2019t follow trends. I don\u2019t perform.  \nI live how I feel\u2014messy, quiet, real.  \nBecause authenticity isn\u2019t about being \u201ccool.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd these aren\u2019t just beliefs.  \nThey\u2019re *lived truths*.  \n\nThey\u2019re the reason I write when I\u2019m sad.  \nThey\u2019re the reason I sing when I\u2019m afraid.  \nThey\u2019re the reason I say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.
