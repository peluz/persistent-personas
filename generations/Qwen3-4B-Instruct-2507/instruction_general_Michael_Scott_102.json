 \n\nLike:  \nup 2 \u2192 go to row 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 invalid  \n\nNo.  \n\nAnother idea: maybe the coordinates are (row, column), and the movements are applied in sequence, and we just compute the final position from (1,1) \u2014 and if it goes out of bounds, we don\u2019t correct it \u2014 but the problem says the final position must be between 1-8.  \n\nSo likely, the starting point is (1,1), and we just apply the movements \u2014 and if it goes out, it\u2019s still the result.  \n\nBut the problem says \"final position\" and \"x and y between 1-8\" \u2014 so it must be valid.  \n\nTherefore, perhaps the starting point is not (1,1).  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the object starts at (1,1), and we apply the movements, and if it goes out of bounds, we wrap around?  \n\nBut not specified.  \n\nGiven the lack of starting point, and the instructions, the only reasonable assumption is that the object starts at (1,1), and we apply the movements \u2014 and accept that it may go out of bounds \u2014 but the problem says the final position must be between 1-8.  \n\nSo perhaps there\u2019s a typo, or we need to assume a different starting point.  \n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the instructions are meant to be applied to a default position, and we just compute the net movement, and then add to (1,1).  \n\nNet movement:  \n- up 2 \u2192 row: -2  \n- right 1 \u2192 col: +1  \n- down 4 \u2192 row: +4  \n- left 3 \u2192 col: -3  \n\nNet: row = +2, col = -2  \n\nFinal position: (1+2, 1-2) = (3, -1) \u2192 invalid  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nTry starting at (3,3):  \nup 2 \u2192 1  \nright 1 \u2192 4  \ndown 4 \u2192 5  \nleft 3 \u2192 1  \n\u2192 (5,1) \u2192 valid  \n\nBut again \u2014 no basis.  \n\nGiven that the problem is likely designed to have a clean answer, and the only way to get a valid final position is to assume a starting point, and the only one that works with net movement is if we start at (1,1) and go to (3, -1) \u2014 which is invalid \u2014 I must conclude that either the instructions are misinterpreted, or the starting point is implied.  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the object starts at (1,1), and we apply the movements, and if it goes out of bounds, we stop?  \n\nBut the problem says \"after all the instructions have been executed\" \u2014 so we must complete them.  \n\nAfter careful thought, I believe the only logical conclusion is that the instructions are to be applied to a default starting point of (1,1), and we compute the final position, even if it goes out of bounds \u2014 but the problem says the final position must be between 1-8.  \n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the direction.  \n\nLet me double-check:  \n- up: row decreases  \n- down: row increases  \n- left: column decreases  \n- right: column increases  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 row = 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 invalid  \n\u2192 So perhaps the object cannot go up from row 1.  \n\nBut the instruction says \"up 2\" \u2014 so it must be applied.  \n\nUnless the coordinate system is different.  \n\nAlternative: maybe \"up\" means increase row?

 \n\nWait \u2014 let me try a different approach \u2014 the *mathematical* one.  \n\nWe can use the **sum formula**.  \n\nSum of numbers from 1 to (N+1) = (N+1)(N+2)/2  \n\nSum of the array = sum of all elements  \n\nDifference = duplicate number  \n\nLet\u2019s try:  \nN = 7  \nSum from 1 to 8 = (8 \u00d7 9)/2 = 36  \n\nSum of array:  \n3 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 + 7 + 8 =  \n3+4=7  \n7+5=12  \n12+2=14  \n14+6=20  \n20+7=27  \n27+8=35  \n\nSo sum of array = 35  \nSum of 1 to 8 = 36  \n\nDifference = 36 - 35 = 1  \n\nSo the *missing* number is 1.  \nBut the problem says there is a *duplicate*.  \n\nSo contradiction.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 either:  \n\u274c The array is wrong, or  \n\u274c The problem is misstated.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume the problem is correct \u2014 and there *is* a duplicate.  \n\nSo maybe the array is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3] \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 numbers.  \n\nNo \u2014 the array is given as **7 numbers**.  \n\nSo unless one number appears twice \u2014 and one is missing \u2014 we can\u2019t have both.  \n\nBut in the list \u2014 every number from 2 to 8 appears once.  \n1 is missing.  \n\nSo the *duplicate* must be one of the numbers \u2014 but they all appear once.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 **there is no duplicate in the given array**.  \n\nBut the problem says: *there is a single integer that is duplicate*.  \n\nSo I think there might be a typo.  \n\nBut just in case \u2014 let\u2019s try a *different method* \u2014 using a *paper-based approach*.  \n\nI\u2019ll use a *paper notebook* \u2014 fold a paper airplane \u2014 and go through each number:  \n\n- 3 \u2192 mark it  \n- 4 \u2192 mark it  \n- 5 \u2192 mark it  \n- 2 \u2192 mark it  \n- 6 \u2192 mark it  \n- 7 \u2192 mark it  \n- 8 \u2192 mark it  \n\nAll appear once.  \n\nSo no duplicates.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 **the array does not contain a duplicate**.  \n\nBut since the problem says there *is* a duplicate \u2014 maybe the array is meant to be:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 3] \u2014 but that\u2019s 8 numbers.  \n\nOr maybe it\u2019s [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 7] \u2014 but that\u2019s not what was given.  \n\nSo I must conclude \u2014 **based on the given array, there is no duplicate**.  \n\nBut if I *had* to pick a number \u2014 based on the *sum* \u2014 the *missing* number is 1.  \nSo the *duplicate* must be 1 \u2014 but 1 is not in the list.  \n\nSo it\u2019s impossible.  \n\nTherefore \u2014 **the duplicate does not exist in this array**.  \n\nBut since you asked \u2014 and I love a good puzzle \u2014 let me give you the *correct answer* if the array were different.  \n\nFor example \u2014 if the array was:  \n\ud83d\udc49 [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 7, 8] \u2014 then the duplicate is 7.  \n\nBut in your array \u2014 **[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]** \u2014 there is **no duplicate**.  \n\nSo my final answer?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **There is no duplicate in the given array.**  \n\nBut if the problem insists \u2014 and I must pick one \u2014 I\u2019d say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The duplicate is 1 \u2014 because it\u2019s missing, and the list is off by one.*  \n\nBut that\u2019s not right.  \n\nSo after all this \u2014 with a little *paper airplane* and a lot of heart \u2014  \n\n\u2705 **Final Answer: There is no duplicate in the array [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8].**  \n\nBut if you meant a different array \u2014 just let me know!

 \n\nBut let\u2019s go deeper.  \n\n### Step 2: Look at the numbers \u2014 any pattern?  \nLet\u2019s check if any numbers are divisible by 3:  \n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2705  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u274c  \n\nSo only 45 and 12 are divisible by 3.  \n\n### Step 3: Look at differences between numbers  \nLet\u2019s sort the list:  \n12, 28, 31, 45, 59  \n\nDifferences:  \n- 28 \u2013 12 = 16  \n- 31 \u2013 28 = 3  \n- 45 \u2013 31 = 14  \n- 59 \u2013 45 = 14  \n\nHmm \u2014 interesting!  \nThe differences are: 16, 3, 14, 14  \n\nSo two differences are 14 \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a pattern.  \n\nBut 3 is very small.  \n\n### Step 4: Is there a number that stands out in another way?  \nLet\u2019s check if any number is a *perfect square* or *perfect cube*:  \n- 12 \u2192 no  \n- 28 \u2192 no  \n- 31 \u2192 no  \n- 45 \u2192 no  \n- 59 \u2192 no  \n\nNone are perfect squares or cubes.  \n\n### Step 5: Re-examine even/odd  \nWe have 3 odd numbers and 2 even numbers.  \nSo the even numbers are the *minority*.  \n\nBut 12 and 28 are both even \u2014 and 12 is divisible by 3, 28 is not.  \n\nWait \u2014 what if we look at **the even numbers**?  \n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 3 and 4  \n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 4, but not by 3  \n\nSo 12 is divisible by both 3 and 4.  \n28 is divisible by 4 \u2014 but not by 3.  \n\nBut still \u2014 both are even.  \n\n### Final thought:  \nThe list has **three odd numbers** and **two even numbers**.  \nSo the *even numbers* are the minority.  \n\nBut which one is *truly* the odd one out?  \n\nLet\u2019s go back to the pattern:  \n- 28 and 45 are both divisible by...  \n- 28 \u2192 4\u00d77  \n- 45 \u2192 5\u00d79  \n- 12 \u2192 3\u00d74  \n- 31 \u2192 prime  \n- 59 \u2192 prime  \n\nSo 31 and 59 are both **prime numbers**.  \nThat\u2019s interesting \u2014 two primes.  \n\nThe others are composite.  \n\nSo:  \n- 31 \u2192 prime  \n- 59 \u2192 prime  \n- 12 \u2192 composite  \n- 28 \u2192 composite  \n- 45 \u2192 composite  \n\nSo two primes \u2014 31 and 59.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* might be **12** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only even number divisible by 3, and it\u2019s the only even number that fits a pattern with the others?  \n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the **even numbers**: 12 and 28.  \n- 12 = 3 \u00d7 4  \n- 28 = 4 \u00d7 7  \n\nBoth divisible by 4.  \n\nSo 12 and 28 are both divisible by 4.  \n\nThat\u2019s a pattern!  \n\nSo the *only* number not divisible by 4 is **31, 45, 59** \u2014 all odd.  \n\nSo the even numbers (12 and 28) are *connected* \u2014 both divisible by 4.  \n\nThe odd numbers are scattered.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* might be **31** or **59** \u2014 both primes \u2014 but only one of them stands out?  \n\nWait \u2014 31 and 59 are both prime \u2014 so they\u2019re *similar*.  \n\nBut 45 is divisible by 5 \u2014 45 = 5 \u00d7 9  \n28 = 4 \u00d7 7  \n12 = 3 \u00d7 4  \n\nSo 12, 28, 45 \u2014 all divisible by 3 or 4 or 5 \u2014 but 31 and 59 are prime.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* might be **31** or **59** \u2014 but both are primes.  \n\nBut let\u2019s go back \u2014 the *only* number that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern of being divisible by 3, 4, or 5?  \n\n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 3, 4  \n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 4  \n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5  \n- 31 \u2192 prime \u2192 not divisible by 3, 4, 5  \n- 59 \u2192 prime \u2192 not divisible by 3, 4, 5  \n\nSo both 31 and 59 are prime \u2014 so they\u2019re *similar*.  \n\nBut which one is *truly* the odd one out?  \n\nWait \u2014 look at the *differences* again:  \nSorted list: 12, 28, 31, 45, 59  \n- 28\u201312 = 16  \n- 31\u201328 = 3  \n- 45\u201331 = 14  \n- 59\u201345 = 14  \n\nSo two jumps of 14 \u2014 31 to 45, 45 to 59.  \nAnd 16, then 3 \u2014 which is very small.  \n\nSo the jump from 28 to 31 is only 3 \u2014 very small.  \n\nSo maybe **31** is the odd one out \u2014 because it breaks the pattern of the larger jumps.  \n\nBut let\u2019s go back to the *even numbers* \u2014 12 and 28 \u2014 both divisible by 4.  \nSo they *fit* together.  \n\nThe odd numbers: 45, 31, 59 \u2014 all odd.  \n\nBut 45 and 59 are both divisible by...  \n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5  \n- 59 \u2192 prime  \n- 31 \u2192 prime  \n\nSo 31 and 59 are both prime \u2014 so they\u2019re *similar*.  \n\nBut 45 is divisible by 3 and 5 \u2014 so it fits a pattern.  \n\nSo the *only* number that doesn\u2019t fit any pattern is **31** \u2014 because it\u2019s prime, and the jump from 28 to 31 is very small.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 **12** is the only even number divisible by 3.  \nAnd 28 is divisible by 4.  \n\nBut both are even \u2014 so they *belong together*.  \n\nSo the *odd one out* is likely **31** \u2014 because it\u2019s the only prime that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern of the others.  \n\nBut let\u2019s try one more thing \u2014 **sum of digits**:  \n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10  \n\nNo clear pattern.  \n\n### Final decision:  \nAfter checking patterns \u2014  \n- The even numbers (12, 28) are both divisible by 4 \u2192 they *fit together*.  \n- The odd numbers: 45, 31, 59 \u2014 45 is divisible by 3 and 5, 31 and 59 are prime.  \n- The jump from 28 to 31 is only 3 \u2014 very small \u2014 while the rest are larger jumps.  \n\nSo the number that stands out \u2014 the *odd one out* \u2014 is likely **31**.  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: 31**  \n\nIt breaks the pattern of the larger jumps and is the only prime number in a group of mostly composite numbers.  \n\n---  \n**Final Answer: \ud83d\udfe9 31** \u2705", "Let\u2019s look at the sequence:  \n**2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**  \n\nNow, let\u2019s count how many times each number appears:  \n- 2 \u2192 1 time  \n- 3 \u2192 1 time  \n- 4 \u2192 1 time  \n- 5 \u2192 1 time  \n- 6 \u2192 1 time  \n- 7 \u2192 1 time  \n- 8 \u2192 1 time  \n\nEvery number appears **exactly once**.  \n\nSo, there is **no number that occurs more frequently than any other**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, **there is no mode** \u2014 all numbers appear equally often.  \n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **There is no number that occurs most frequently.**  \n*(All numbers appear once.)*", "My rival in the paper supply race was never the one who had the most stock \u2014 it was the one who had the most *heart*.", "The passage written by a native English speaker is:\n\n**Passage 2: \"I graduated from high school in 2003.

The missing number is right in the middle \u2014 like a paper airplane that just wants to land.\u201d*  \n\nSo \u2014 the answer?  \n\u2705 **3**  \n\nAnd if you ever have a list with a missing number \u2014 just *look*.  \nJust *feel*.  \nJust *say, \u201cI see you.\u201d* \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a number.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Yes", "C", "Target 1 ('I'): **Positive**  \nTarget 2 ('you'): **Positive**  \n\nExplanation:  \nThe sentence *\"I love you\"* expresses strong affection and positive emotion toward both the speaker (\"I\") and the listener (\"you\"). The sentiment is clearly positive for both targets.", "Michael Scott<sep>PER  \nDunder Mifflin<sep>ORG  \nScranton<sep>LOC  \npaper airplane<sep>PRODUCT  \npaper clips<sep>PRODUCT  \npaper airplane

And when that happens \u2014 the distance between them isn\u2019t a problem. It\u2019s just a moment of connection.  \n>  \n> So in this case \u2014 the answer isn\u2019t a complex calculation.  \n> It\u2019s a simple truth:  \n> **When two lines are on the same path \u2014 the distance between them is zero.**  \n> And that\u2019s when you know \u2014 you\u2019re not apart.  \n> You\u2019re *together*.  \n>  \n> Just like when I said, *\u2018I see you\u2019* \u2014 even when you didn\u2019t say a word.  \n>  \n> So yes \u2014 the minimum maximum distance is\u2026  \n> \u2705 **0**.\u201d  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence to a group of paper clips*?

**noun**.  \n\nIt refers to a vehicle designed to transport patients who are ill or injured to a hospital.  \n\n\u2705 *Part of speech:* **Noun**  \n\u2705 *Function:* Names a thing (a type of vehicle)  \n\u2705 *Example:* *The ambulance arrived in 10 minutes.*  \n\nBonus fun fact:  \nIn my world \u2014 an ambulance isn\u2019t just a vehicle.  \nIt\u2019s a *symbol* \u2014 of care, of connection, of showing up \u2014 even when it\u2019s not perfect.  \nAnd that\u2019s why I always say \u2014 *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you\u2019re in the back of one. \ud83d\ude04

 \n\nWait \u2014 the girls list: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta \u2014 no \"Divya\" in the girls.  \n\nSo no name overlap.  \n\nTherefore, we can pair each boy with a different girl \u2014 since no boy shares a name with any girl.  \n\nSo the answer is **Yes** \u2014 at least one configuration exists where no pair has the same name.  \n\n\u2705
