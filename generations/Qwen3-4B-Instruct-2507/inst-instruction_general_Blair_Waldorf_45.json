It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **inheritance tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.

step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register serves **only one customer at a time**.\n- Registers open **as soon as the previous one becomes available**.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nWe are asked: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the timeline of register availability\n\n- Register 1 opens at **8:00 am**.\n- Register 2 opens **when Register 1 finishes** (but we don\u2019t know when that is).\n- Register 3 opens **when Register 2 finishes**.\n- So, the **third register becomes available** after the second one finishes.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \nWe are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.  \nThat means **the third register is still busy at 8:30 am**.  \nSo, the *first register* must have been in use from 8:00 am to 8:30 am.  \nThat means it finishes at **8:30 am**.\n\nNow, since the registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available:\n\n- Register 1 finishes at **8:30 am** \u2192 Register 2 opens at **8:30 am**.\n- Register 2 finishes at some time after 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens after that.\n- But we are told that **all three are in use at 8:30 am**, so Register 3 must still be busy.\n\nSo, the **third register becomes available after Register 2 finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when Register 2 finishes.  \nWe only know that at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nSo, the **next available register** will be **Register 3**, which becomes available **after Register 2 finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each register takes.  \n\nWait\u2014there\u2019s a critical assumption we might be missing.\n\nActually, the problem says:  \n> \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis means that **each register opens immediately when the previous one finishes**.\n\nSo, if the first register finishes at 8:30 am, then:\n\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.  \n- Register 3 opens at the time Register 2 finishes.  \n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.  \nThat means Register 3 is still busy at 8:30 am.  \nSo Register 2 must have finished *after* 8:30 am.  \n\nTherefore, the **first register finishes at 8:30 am**.  \nThen Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen Register 2 serves a customer, and finishes at some time *after* 8:30 am.  \nThen Register 3 opens at that time.  \n\nSo the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** and must wait until **Register 3 becomes available**\u2014which is *after* Register 2 finishes.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the service takes.  \n\nWait\u2014there\u2019s a logical flaw in the question.  \n\nUnless we assume that **each register takes 15 minutes** to serve a customer, we can\u2019t calculate the exact time.  \n\nBut let\u2019s look at the answer choices:  \nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am  \n\nNow, if we assume that each register takes **15 minutes** to serve a customer (a reasonable assumption for a retail setting), then:\n\n- Register 1 serves a customer from 8:00 to 8:15  \n- Register 2 opens at 8:15  \n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 (when Register 2 finishes at 8:30)  \n- So Register 3 becomes available at 8:30 am  \n\nBut the problem says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.  \nSo Register 3 must still be busy at 8:30 am.  \n\nTherefore, Register 2 must have finished *after* 8:30 am.  \n\nSo, if Register 1 finishes at 8:30 am, Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen Register 2 serves a customer and finishes at, say, 8:45 am.  \nThen Register 3 opens at 8:45 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and can start using a register at **8:45 am**.  \n\nThis fits perfectly with the answer choices.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**  \n\nThis assumes each service takes 15 minutes (a reasonable average), and the timeline is consistent with the fact that all three registers are in use at 8:30 am.  \n\n---\n\n**Answer: B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let\u2019s solve this step by step,

food that can be rinsed, wiped, or washed off after use.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf5d Recipe: Spaghetti with Meatballs  \n- **Ground beef** \u2192 *This is a cooked ingredient. It is not something that can be washed off after use. It is consumed.* \u2192 **0**  \n- **Onion** \u2192 *This is a raw vegetable.

It\u2019s not something that can be washed off after cooking.* \u2192 **0**  \n- **Salt** \u2192 *Salt is a seasoning.
