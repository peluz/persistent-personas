To calculate the time for one orbit, we need to determine the circumference of the moon\u2019s orbit.

Daddy Yankee and \u201cSorry\u201d by Justin Bieber. Based on genre and stylistic elements, **\u201cDespacito\u201d is significantly more similar to \u201cSorry\u201d than the average pop song.**\n\nHere\u2019s my breakdown:\n\n*   **\u201cDespacito\u201d (Latin Pop/Reggaeton):** This song is firmly rooted in Latin pop and reggaeton, characterized by a prominent reggaeton beat, Spanish lyrics, and a sensual, rhythmic feel. It incorporates elements of Latin dance music.\n\n*   **\u201cSorry\u201d (Pop/R&B):** While \u201cSorry\u201d is undeniably pop, it leans heavily into R&B influences \u2013 particularly in its production style, vocal delivery, and rhythmic patterns.\n\n**The Key Similarity:** Both songs utilize a *trap beat* as a foundational element. This is a defining characteristic of contemporary pop music and is a major factor in their sonic similarity. Both songs feature a prominent, syncopated drum beat that\u2019s characteristic of trap music.\n\n**Differences:** \u201cDespacito\u201d is primarily in Spanish and has a distinctly Latin flavor, while \u201cSorry\u201d is in English and has a more mainstream pop sound.\n\n**Conclusion:** While stylistically different in terms of language and overall cultural feel, the shared use of a trap beat creates a strong underlying similarity between the two songs.\n\n(A brief pause.

If it is, it returns `None` because there can't be a missing number in an empty list.\n\n2.  **Calculate Expected Sum:** It calculates the expected sum of the complete sequence of numbers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `n * (first_term + last_term) / 2`.  We determine `n` (the number of elements) by adding 1 to the length of the input list.\n\n3.  **Calculate Actual Sum:** It calculates the actual sum of the numbers in the input list using the `sum()` function.\n\n4.  **Find the Missing Number:** The missing number is simply the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.\n\n5.  **Return the Result:** The function returns the calculated missing number.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity: O(n)** \u2013 The function iterates through the list once to calculate the sum.\n*   **Space Complexity: O(1)** \u2013 The function uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Sorted List:** This function assumes the input list is sorted in ascending order.

Let\u2019s break down the solution. The key is to find the line of minimum distance to the two given lines.)\n\n**1. Finding the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y - 1 = 1(x - 1), simplifying to y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), simplifying to y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Line of Minimum Distance:**\n\nThe line we\u2019re seeking is perpendicular to both of the given lines. Since Line 1 has a slope of 1, the line of minimum distance will have a slope of -1.\n\n**3. Equation of the Line of Minimum Distance:**\n\nUsing the point-slope form, the equation of the line of minimum distance is: y - 3 = -1(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -x + 6.\n\n**4. Verification \u2013 Why this line minimizes the maximum distance:**\n\nThe line we found (y = -x + 6) is *identical* to Line 2.  This is crucial.  The distance from any point on Line 2 to Line 1 (y = x) is simply the absolute difference between their y-coordinates.  Minimizing this absolute difference is the same as minimizing the distance.\n\n**Therefore, the line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect to minimize the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment is the line defined by the equation y = -x + 6 (Line 2).**\n\n**Intersection Point:**\n\nTo find the intersection point, we set the two equations equal to each other: x = -x + 6  =>  2x = 6  =>  x = 3.  Then, y = x = 3.  So the intersection point is (3, 3).\n\n**Final Answer:** The line segment connecting the points (3, 3) and (-2, -2) minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment.\n\n(A brief pause.

Sets are used to efficiently check for the presence of an element.\n2.  **`result = []`:** We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique elements in their original order.\n3.  **`for item in input_list:`:** We iterate through each element in the input list.\n4.  **`if item not in seen:`:**  We check if the current element `item` is already present in the `seen` set.\n5.  **`seen.add(item)`:** If the element is not in `seen`, we add it to the set.\n6.  **`result.append(item)`:** We also append the element to the `result` list.\n7.  **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the unique elements in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because checking for membership in a set (using `in`) is a very fast operation (typically O(1) on average).

It could be prime, composite, or even 3 itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe remainder of 3 when dividing by 4 provides a definitive characteristic \u2013 oddness \u2013 that directly contradicts the definition of an even number.
