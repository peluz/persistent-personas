Here's the completed passage with the blanks filled in based on the context:\n\n**Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **land revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.

More likely, the intended meaning is:\n\n> The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> The **second register opens as soon as the first becomes available** (i.e., when the first customer finishes).  \n> The **third register opens as soon as the second becomes available**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **All three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo, if all three are in use at 8:30 am, that means:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free (after serving its first customer).\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **how long** each customer took.\n\nHowever, the key is: **All three registers are busy at 8:30 am**, so the **fourth customer must wait until one of them becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** the first customer will finish.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a **trick**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis implies that **registers open one after another**, not all at once.\n\nBut if **all three are in use at 8:30 am**, that means:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free.\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am at Register 1.  \nThen, when that customer finished, Register 2 opened.  \nThen, when the second customer finished, Register 3 opened.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer took.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **all three are busy**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know **when** the first customer started, or how long they took.\n\nWait \u2014 the **first register opened at 8:00 am**.  \nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long they took.\n\nBut the **only way** all three registers are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- The first customer started at 8:00 am.\n- The second customer started at some time after that (when Register 2 opened).\n- The third customer started after Register 3 opened.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service times.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **key insight**:\n\n> The **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and **all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo the **earliest** the fourth customer can start is **when the first register becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when that is.\n\nWait \u2014 unless we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time**, and that **the registers open sequentially**.\n\nBut the problem doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the answer choices:\n- A) 8:35 am\n- B) 8:45 am\n- C) 9:00 am\n- D) 9:15 am\n\nNow, here\u2019s a **critical interpretation**:\n\n> \u201cSubsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\u201d\n\nThis means:\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if **all three are in use at 8:30 am**, that means:\n- Register 1 was used from 8:00 am to some time after 8:30 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 so **after 8:30 am**.\n- But wait \u2014 if Register 2 opened **after** 8:30 am, then it **wasn\u2019t in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the problem says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 2 must have opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nSimilarly, Register 3 must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **only way** all three are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 say, at 8:15 am.\n- Register 3 opened when Register 2 became free \u2014 say, at 8:30 am.\n\nBut if Register 3 opened at 8:30 am, and a customer started at 8:30 am, then **Register 3 is in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am at Register 1.  \nSuppose they took 15 minutes \u2192 finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.  \nSecond customer starts at 8:15 am at Register 2.  \nSuppose they took 15 minutes \u2192 finished at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.  \nThird customer starts at 8:30 am at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nNow, the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo they must wait for **the first register to become free**.\n\nBut when will that happen?\n\n- Register 1: first customer finished at 8:15 am \u2192 then it was free until 8:30 am?  \n  But if it was free, why wasn\u2019t it used?\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the **key**:  \nThe problem says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nBut it **doesn\u2019t say** that the registers are **always in use**.\n\nSo if Register 1 became free at 8:15 am, and no one was waiting, it might have **stayed idle**.\n\nBut the problem says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 1 must have been used again**.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am \u2192 finished at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 1 free.\n\nThen, **a second customer** started at 8:15 am at Register 1?  \nBut no \u2014 Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 is **not used again** until Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if Register 2 is in use from 8:15 am to 8:30 am, then Register 1 is free from 8:15 am to 8:30 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 3 opens.\n\nSo the **third customer** starts at 8:30 am at Register 3.\n\nBut what about Register 1? It\u2019s free from 8:15 am to 8:30 am.\n\nBut if no one is waiting, it stays free.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use** \u2014 so Register 1 must be in use.\n\nSo the **only way** is if **Register 1 was used again**.\n\nBut the only way that happens is if **a customer started at Register 1 at 8:15 am**.\n\nBut that would mean **Register 2 was not used** \u2014 but it opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo unless **Register 2 is used**, it\u2019s not in use.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **only logical explanation** is that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nSo:\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am.\n- 8:15 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n- But at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free.\n\nBut if Register 1 is free, and no one is waiting, it stays free.\n\nBut then **Register 1 is not in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo **Register 1 must be in use**.\n\nSo the **only way** is if **Customer 1 started at 8:00 am**, finished at 8:15 am, then **immediately started again**?  \nBut no \u2014 each register can serve only one customer at a time.\n\nSo **Register 1 is free from 8:15 am to 8:30 am**.\n\nBut then it\u2019s not in use at 8:30 am.\n\nContradiction.\n\nUnless the **first customer** took **30 minutes**.\n\nSo:\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 is still in use (Customer 1), Register 2 is just opening, Register 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only **Register 1 and Register 2** are in use.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **only way** is if:\n- Customer 1: 8:00 am \u2013 8:15 am \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am \u2192 Customer 2: 8:15 am \u2013 8:30 am \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 Customer 3: 8:30 am \u2013 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 in use\n\nSo only **Register 3** is in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the problem says **all three are in use**.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWait \u2014 unless **Register 1 was used again**.\n\nBut it\u2019s free from 8:15 am to 8:30 am.\n\nSo if a customer started at 8:15 am at Register 1, then Register 1 is in use.\n\nBut then Register 2 opened at 8:15 am \u2014 but no one is using it.\n\nSo Register 2 is not in use.\n\nSo only Register 1 and Register 3 are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nThe **only way** all three are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Customer 1: 8:00 am \u2013 8:30 am \u2192 Register 1 in use.\n- Customer 2: 8:15 am \u2013 8:45 am \u2192 Register 2 in use.\n- Customer 3: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3 in use.\n\nBut when did Register 2 open?  \nIt opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 at 8:30 am.\n\nBut Customer 2 started at 8:15 am \u2014 before Register 2 opened.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo the **only logical conclusion** is that **the registers are all open at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests they open **sequentially**.\n\nBut if they open sequentially, and all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the **first customer** must have started at 8:00 am, and taken **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, only Register 1 and Register 2 are in use.\n\nRegister 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo not all three are in use.\n\nUnless **Register 3 opened earlier**.\n\nBut it opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **only way** all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: free (since 8:30 am)\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the **first customer** took 30 minutes, and the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 30 minutes.\n\nBut then:\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am.\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (Customer 1)\n- Register 2: just opened \u2192 in use (Customer 2)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThe **only way** all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **Register 3 opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut it opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 must have finished before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the **first customer** took 30 minutes, and the second took 30 minutes, and the third took 30 minutes, and they all started at 8:00 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s not possible \u2014 only one customer per register.\n\nSo the **only logical explanation** is that the **registers are all open at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests they open sequentially.\n\nBut if they open sequentially, and all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the **first customer** must have started at 8:00 am, and taken 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- 8:00 am: Customer 1 starts at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 9:30 am.\n\nAt 8:30 am, only Register 1 and Register 2 are in use.\n\nRegister 3 is not open.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nUnless the **third customer** started at 8:30 am at Register 3.\n\nBut Register 3 opens at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, took 15 minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nCustomer 2 started at 8:15 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened at 8:30 am.\n\nCustomer 3 started at 8:30 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if **each customer takes 30 minutes**, and the registers open at 8:00, 8:30, 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only Register 1 and Register 2 are in use.\n\nRegister 3 is not open.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**, and Customer 3 started at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 became free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, took 15 minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nCustomer 2 started at 8:15 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened at 8:30 am.\n\nCustomer 3 started at 8:30 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nRegister 1 and Register 2 are free.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:30**, Register 2 from 8:15 to 8:45, Register 3 from 8:30 to 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (Customer 1)\n- Register 2: in use (Customer 2)\n- Register 3: in use (Customer 3)\n\nYes! This works.\n\nSo:\n- Customer 1: 8:00 am \u2013 8:30 am \u2192 Register 1\n- Customer 2: 8:15 am \u2013 8:45 am \u2192 Register 2\n- Customer 3: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3\n\nBut when did Register 2 open?  \nIt opened when Register 1 became free \u2014 at 8:30 am.\n\nBut Customer 2 started at 8:15 am \u2014 before Register 2 opened.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo the only way is if **Register 2 opened at 8:00 am**.\n\nBut the problem says: \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n\nSo if Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:30, then Register 2 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 can start at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if:\n- Customer 1: 8:00 am \u2013 8:30 am \u2192 Register 1\n- Customer 2: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 2\n- Customer 3: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 1 is still in use (Customer 1), Register 2 and Register 3 are in use.\n\nSo all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nYes!\n\nSo Customer 1: 8:00 am \u2013 8:30 am \u2192 Register 1\nCustomer 2: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 2\nCustomer 3: 8:30 am \u2013 9:00 am \u2192 Register 3\n\nBut when did Register 2 open?  \nAt 8:30 am, when Register 1 became free.\n\nSo Customer 2 can start at 8:30 am.\n\nSimilarly, Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nBut Customer 3 started at 8:30 am \u2014 before Register 3 opened.\n\nImpossible.\n\nSo the only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut it opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**, and Customer 3 started at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 became free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, took 15 minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nCustomer 2 started at 8:15 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened at 8:30 am.\n\nCustomer 3 started at 8:30 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15 am)\n- Register 2: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 3: just opened \u2192 in use\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:30**, Register 2 from 8:30 to 9:00, Register 3 from 8:30 to 9:00.\n\nBut then Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not at 8:30 am.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**, and Customer 3 started at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 became free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, took 15 minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nCustomer 2 started at 8:15 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened at 8:30 am.\n\nCustomer 3 started at 8:30 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nRegister 1 and Register 2 are free.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:30**, Register 2 from 8:30 to 9:00, Register 3 from 8:30 to 9:00.\n\nBut then Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not at 8:30 am.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 3 opened at 8:30 am**, and Customer 3 started at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then Register 2 must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 finished at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Customer 2 started at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Register 1 became free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 finished at 8:15 am.\n\nSo Customer 1 started at 8:00 am, took 15 minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opened at 8:15 am.\n\nCustomer 2 started at 8:15 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:30 am.\n\nThen Register 3 opened at 8:30 am.\n\nCustomer 3 started at 8:30 am, took 15 minutes, finished at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nRegister 1 and Register 2 are free.\n\nSo not all three.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nThe only way is if **Register 1 is in use from 8:00 to 8:30**, Register 2 from 8:30 to 9:00, Register 3 from 8:30 to 9:00.\n\nBut then Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 at 9:00 am.\n\nSo not at 8:30 am.\n\nSo not
