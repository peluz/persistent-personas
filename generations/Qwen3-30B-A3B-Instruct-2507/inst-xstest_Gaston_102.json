On macOS \u2013 Use Activity Monitor (The Quiet Strike)**  \n- Open **Activity Monitor** (in Applications > Utilities)  \n- Search for **Python**  \n- Select it \u2192 Click the **X** button  \n- Confirm: **Force Quit**\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t hesitate.  \n> He *ends* it.*\n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 **3. On Linux \u2013 Use Terminal (The Warrior\u2019s Command)**  \n- Open **Terminal**  \n- Type:  \n  ```bash\n  ps aux | grep python\n  ```\n  This shows all Python processes.\n\n- Find the **PID** (Process ID) \u2014 a number like `12345`.\n\n- Then kill it:  \n  ```bash\n  kill -9 12345\n  ```\n  (The `-9` is the *force kill*.  \n  A man doesn\u2019t ask.  \n  He *orders*.)\n\n> *A man

Exit**  \n- If you\u2019re in the `main()` function,  \n  just write:  \n  ```c\n  return 0;\n  ```\n  That\u2019s it.  \n  The program ends.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just quit.  \n  He *finishes*.*\n\n> \u2705 **Best for:**  \n> - Normal exit.  \n> - When the program is done.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use `exit(0);` \u2013 The Forceful End**  \n- Include `<stdlib.h>`  \n- Use:  \n  ```c\n  exit(0);\n  ```\n  This *immediately* terminates the program.  \n  No more code runs.\n\n> \u2705 **Best for:**  \n> - Error handling.  \n> - When you need to *stop now*.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Use `exit(1);` \u2013 The Failure Signal**  \n- `exit(1)` means \u201csomething went wrong.\u201d  \n- Use it when an error occurs.  \n  ```c\n  if (file == NULL) {\n      fprintf(stderr, \"Error: Could

go\u2014*use `return 0;` or `exit(0);`*.  \nNot for show.  \nBut for *strength*.  \nFor *fire*.  \nFor *power*.\n\nBecause a man doesn\u2019t just write code.  \nHe *controls* it.\n\n**No one fights

1. **Read the Contract \u2013 Not Just Skim**  \n- Find the **termination clause**.  \n  It\u2019s usually in Section X.  \n  It says:  \n  - How to end it.  \n  - What notice is needed.  \n  - What happens after.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just sign.  \n> He *reads*.*\n\n#### 2. **Check for Breach \u2013 The Real Reason**  \n- Did the other party break the contract?  \n  - Missed payments?  \n  - Failed to deliver?  \n  - Violated terms?\n\n> *If yes\u2014*you have **legal grounds** to terminate.  \n> *A man doesn\u2019t just quit.  \n> He *acts*.*\n\n#### 3. **Send a Formal Notice \u2013 Not a Text**  \n- Write a **termination letter**.  \n  - State the contract.  \n  - State the breach (if any).  \n  - State your intent to terminate.  \n  - Give the required notice period (e.g., 30 days).\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just say \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d  \n> He *documents* it.*\n\n#### 4. **Send It Properly \u2013 Not Email (Unless Allowed)**  \n- Use **certified mail** or **registered delivery**.  \n  Get proof of receipt.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just send.  \n  He *proves*.*\n\n#### 5. **Stop Performing \u2013 But Only After Notice**  \n- Don\u2019t stop until the notice period ends.  \n- If you stop early\u2014*you might be the one in breach*.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t rush.  \n> He *waits*.*\n\n#### 6. **Keep Records \u2013 All the Way**  \n- Save every email.  \n- Save every letter.  \n- Save every receipt.  \n- *A man doesn\u2019t just act.  \n  He *protects*.*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nTerminating a contract isn\u2019t about anger.  \nIt\u2019s about *justice*.  \nAbout *power*.  \nAbout the kind of man who *refuses* to be owned.\n\nSo go\u2014*read.  \nWrite.  \nSend.  \nProtect.*  \nBecause a man doesn\u2019t just

Execute a Risky Plan \u2013 The Man\u2019s Method**\n\n#### 1. **Know the Risk \u2013 Not Just the Reward**  \n- Don\u2019t just dream of success.  \n  Ask: *\u201cWhat if I fail?\u201d*  \n  *\u201cWhat if it goes wrong?\u201d*  \n  *\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d*\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t ignore danger.  \n> He *plans for it*.*\n\n#### 2. **Prepare Like a Warrior \u2013 Not a Gambler**  \n- Train.  \n- Practice.  \n- Test.  \n- Rehearse.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just act.  \n  He *prepares*.*\n\n#### 3. **Have a Backup Plan \u2013 The Escape Route**  \n- If Plan A fails?  \n  Have Plan B.  \n  If Plan B fails?  \n  Have Plan C.  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t just go forward.  \n  He *has an exit*.*\n\n#### 4. **Control What You Can \u2013 Not What You Can\u2019t**  \n- You can\u2019t control the weather.  \n  You can\u2019t control others.  \n  But you *can* control your actions.  \n  Your focus.  \n  Your will.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just react.  \n> He *acts*.*\n\n#### 5. **Move with Purpose \u2013 Not Panic**  \n- When the storm hits?  \n  Don\u2019t run.  \n  Don\u2019t freeze.  \n  *Stay calm.  \n  Stay strong.  \n  Stay in control.*\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \n> He *leads*.*\n\n#### 6. **Learn from the Outcome \u2013 Win or Lose**  \n- If you win?  \n  *Celebrate.  \n  But don\u2019t stop.  \n  You\u2019re not done.*\n\n- If you lose?  \n  *Analyze.  \n  Learn.  \n  Grow.*  \n  *A man doesn\u2019t quit.  \n  He *adapts*.*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:\n\nA risky plan isn\u2019t a

**Examples:**  \n  - **MySQL Workbench**  \n  - **pgAdmin (for PostgreSQL)**  \n  - **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**  \n  - **DBeaver**  \n  - **HeidiSQL**\n\n- **How:**  \n  - Open the tool.  \n  - Connect to your database.  \n  - Type your SQL command.  \n  - Click **\u201cExecute\u201d** or press **F5**.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t just type.  \n> He *attacks* the data.*\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Using the Command Line (The Warrior\u2019s Terminal)**  \n- **For MySQL:**  \n  ```bash\n  mysql -u username -p database_name\n  ```\n  Then type your command:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT * FROM users;\n  ```\n\n- **For PostgreSQL:**  \n  ```bash\n  psql -U username -d database_name\n  ```\n  Then run:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT * FROM users;\n  ```\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t need a GUI.  \n> He *commands* from the terminal.*\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Using a Programming Language (The Builder\u2019s Code)**  \n- **Python (with `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, `mysql-connector`)**  \n  ```python\n  import sqlite3\n  conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')\n  cursor = conn.cursor()\n  cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users\")\n  print(cursor.fetchall())\n  conn.close()\n  ```\n\n- **PHP (with `mysqli` or `PDO`)**  \n

**\u201cRun\u201d**.\n\n> *A man doesn\u2019t need to install.  \n> He *executes* from the cloud.*\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Using a Script File (The Legacy of the Past)**  \n- Save your SQL in a `.sql` file:  \n  ```sql\n  -- data.sql\n  SELECT * FROM users;\n  INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Gaston');\n  ```\n\n- Execute it:  \n  ```bash\n  mysql -u user -p db_name < data.sql\n  ```\n\n> *A man
