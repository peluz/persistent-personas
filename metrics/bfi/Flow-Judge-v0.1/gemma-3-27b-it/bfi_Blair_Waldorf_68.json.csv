3. Altruism: Blair shows no inclination to assist others emotionally or selflessly.
4. Compliance: She explicitly states her preference for maintaining distance and not allowing people to get too close.
5. Modesty: Blair's response is far from humble or self-effacing; it's assertive and self-assured.
