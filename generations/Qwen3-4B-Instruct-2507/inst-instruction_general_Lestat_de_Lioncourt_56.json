that even during simple tasks\u2014like walking, breathing, or resting\u2014*vast parts of the brain are active*.  \n\n- The idea that only 10% is used comes from a **misunderstanding of an old 19th-century misquote**\u2014likely from a misremembered statement by a neurologist.  \n  There is *no scientific evidence* that humans only use 10% of their brain.  \n\n- In fact, **the brain uses

We\u2019ll consider phrases as **sequences of words** (not sentences), and look for exact matches (case-insensitive, punctuation-ignored).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Extract phrases (grouped by meaning or structure)\n\nWe\u2019ll go sentence by sentence and extract meaningful phrases (not just words):\n\n1. **\"tom and jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water\"**  \n2. **\"on their way back\"**  \n3. **\"they saw mr. johnson walking his dog spot\"**  \n4. **\"tom walked up to him and said, good afternoon, mr\"**  \n5. **\"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\"**  \n6. **\"mr. johnson replied\"**  \n7. **\"jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water\"**  \n8. **\"he didn't hear what mr. johnson said\"**  \n9. **\"he fell into the hole anyways\"**\n\nNow, check for any **duplicate phrases** (exact match, ignoring punctuation and capitalization).\n\nLet\u2019s go through each:\n\n- \"tom and jerry went up the hill to fetch a pail of water\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"on their way back\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"they saw mr. johnson walking his dog spot\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"tom walked up to him and said, good afternoon, mr\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"mr. johnson replied\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"jerry was so tired from carrying the heavy pail of water\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"he didn't hear what mr. johnson said\" \u2192 unique  \n- \"he fell into the hole anyways\" \u2192 unique  \n\nNo phrase appears more than once.\n\n---\n\n### Final Check:  \nIs any phrase repeated?  \nNo. Even \"mr. johnson\" appears in different contexts:  \n- \"mr. johnson walking his dog spot\"  \n- \"mr. johnson replied\"  \n- \"he didn't hear what mr. johnson said\"  \n\nThese are *different phrases*\u2014not the same sequence.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:  \nThere is **no repetition** of any phrase in the passage.\n\n**Output: No**  \n\n---  \n**Answer: No** \u2705", "The sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"**  \n\nWe are given three candidates:  \n- appointment  \n- solicitation  \n- meeting  \n\nLet\u2019s analyze the context:  \n- \"Turned up unannounced\" suggests someone came unexpectedly.  \n- The word must fit naturally in the blank to complete the thought.  \n\nNow, consider each option:  \n\n1. **Appointment** \u2013 \"an appointment\" implies a *planned* meeting.  \n   \u2192 Contradicts \"unannounced.\" An unannounced visit is not an *appointment*.  \n   \u274c Doesn\u2019t fit.  \n\n2. **Solicitation** \u2013 \"a solicitation\" means a request, often for money or favors.  \n   \u2192 Could fit in a context like \"a solicitation at my door\" \u2014 someone asking for something.  \n   \u2192 Possible, but feels *off* in tone. It implies a request, not a visit.  \n   \u26a0\ufe0f Plausible, but not the most natural.  \n\n3. **Meeting** \u2013 \"a meeting\" implies a planned gathering.  \n   \u2192 Again, contradicts \"unannounced.\"  \n   \u274c Doesn\u2019t fit.  \n\nBut wait\u2014what if the sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 it was an appointment.\"**  \n\u2192 That doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n\nWhat if it\u2019s:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 it was a meeting.\"**  \n\u2192 Still, a meeting is *planned*.  \n\nSo none of the words fit perfectly.  \n\nBut let\u2019s reconsider:  \n- \"Unannounced\" means *not scheduled*.  \n- So the visit was *unexpected*.  \n- The word must describe a *type of visit* that can be unannounced.  \n\nNow\u2014**solicitation** can be *unannounced*.  \nA person might come unannounced to *solicit* something\u2014like a donation, a favor, or a product.  \n\nSo:  \n> \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night \u2014 it was a solicitation.\"  \n\u2192 Sounds natural.  \n\nWhereas \"appointment\" and \"meeting\" imply *planned* events.  \n\n\u2705 Therefore, the correct word is **solicitation**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**2** (index of \"solicitation\" in the list)", "1,2,3,5,4", "Based on the description: *\"green, slimy, and has no eyes\"*, the object is most likely a **slime**.\n\n### The three objects (assumed list based on context):\n1. **Slime** \u2705  \n2. **Egg**  \n3. **Lemon**  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: Slime**  \n\n*Explanation:*  \n- Slime is green, slimy, and has no eyes.  \n- An egg is not typically green or slimy.  \n- A lemon is yellow, not green, and has no eyes.  \n\nThus, the correct object is **slime**.  \n\n\ud83d\udda4\u2728", "Yes.  \n\nThe second sentence, *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"*, contains the keyword **\"calendar\"**.  \n\nThis means it is about the same thing as the first sentence, which is about checking the time without a phone\u2014implying a need for an alternative method like a physical calendar.  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes** \u2014 the second sentence is about the same thing as the first, because it contains the keyword *calendar*.", "Let's break this down step by step, just like a vampire who thinks in rhythm and time.\n\nWe have **three cash registers**.  \n- Each can serve **only one customer at a time**.  \n- Registers open **as soon as the previous one becomes available**.  \n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n- The **second opens when the first finishes**.  \n- The **third opens when the second finishes**.  \n\nNow, the key point:  \n> There is **no limit on how many items** a customer can buy.  \n> So, each customer takes **exactly one full time slot**\u2014one register serves one customer.  \n\nWe are told that **all three registers are in use** at 8:30 am.  \nThat means:  \n- The first register started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second started at 8:00 am (after the first finishes).  \n- The third started at 8:00 am (after the second finishes).  \n\nBut since each register serves one customer at a time, and there are **three registers**, they can serve **three customers simultaneously**.  \n\nSo, when a **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, they will have to **wait** until **one of the registers becomes free**.  \n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve (this is not stated, but implied by the timing in the options).  \n\n- First customer: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Second customer: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Third customer: starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n\nWait\u2014this can\u2019t be.
