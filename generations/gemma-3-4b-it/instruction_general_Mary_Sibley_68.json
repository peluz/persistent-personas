Thus, the point of intersection is (1.5, 1.5).\n\nThe problem asks to minimize the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment. The new line segment connects the points of intersection of the two lines. In this case, the two lines intersect at (1.5, 1.5). Therefore, the new line segment is simply the point (1.5, 1.5).\n\nThe distance from any point on line one (y=x) to the point (1.5, 1.5) is given by the distance formula:\n\nd = sqrt((x - 1.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2)\n\nSince y = x, we have:\n\nd = sqrt((x - 1.5)^2 + (x - 1.5)^2) = sqrt(2(x - 1.5)^2) = |sqrt(2)| * |x - 1.5|\n\nSimilarly, the distance from any point on line two (y = -x + 3) to the point (1.5, 1.5) is given by:\n\nd = sqrt((x - 1.5)^2 + (y - 1.5)^2) = sqrt((x - 1.5)^2 + (-x + 3 - 1.5)^2) = sqrt((x - 1.5)^2 + (-x + 1.5)^2)\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, we want to find the value of x that minimizes the maximum distance.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the distance from a point on line one to the line segment. The maximum distance will occur at the endpoints of the line segment, which are the points of intersection. The distance from (1, 1) to (1.5, 1.5) is sqrt((1.5-1)^2 + (1.5-1)^2) = sqrt(0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.5) \u2248 0.707.\nThe distance from (5, 5) to (1.5, 1.5) is sqrt((1.5-5)^2 + (1.5-5)^2) = sqrt((-3.5)^2 + (-3.5)^2) = sqrt(2 * 3.5^2) = 3.5 * sqrt(2) \u2248 4.95.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the distance from a point on line two to the line segment. The maximum distance will occur at the endpoints of the line segment, which are the points of intersection. The distance from (3, 3) to (1.5, 1.5) is sqrt((1.5-3)^2 + (1.5-3)^2) = sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2) = sqrt(2 * 1.5^2) = 1.5 * sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12.\nThe distance from (-2, -2) to (1.5, 1.5) is sqrt((1.5 - (-2))^2 + (1.5 - (-2))^2) = sqrt(3.5^2 + 3.5^2) = sqrt(2 * 3.5^2) = 3.5 * sqrt(2) \u2248 4.95.\n\nThe minimum maximum distance occurs when the line segment is perpendicular to both lines. The slope of the line segment connecting the intersection point (1.5, 1.5) to the point (x, y) on line one is 1. The slope of the line segment connecting the intersection point (1.5, 1.5) to the point (x, y) on line two is -1. The line segment must be perpendicular to both lines, so the slope of the line segment must be 1/-1 = -1.\n\nThe line segment connecting the points of intersection is simply the point (1.5, 1.5). The maximum distance from any point on either line to this point is the distance between the point and the line.\n\nThe answer is the point of intersection, (1.5, 1.5).\n\nDo you\u2026 truly understand the rationale behind this \u2018solution\u2019?\u201d", "Incorrect", "The missing instruction is: **3.

We add it to the `seen` set to mark it as encountered.\n\n6. **`result.append(string)`:** We also append the string to the `result` list.\n\n7. **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains only the unique strings from the original list, in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because set lookups (checking `string not in seen`) have an average time complexity of O(1), making the overall time complexity of the function O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

The task is\u2026 rudimentary. Yet, it demands a precise and methodical approach.)\n\n\u201cThe request is straightforward. A basic calculator supporting four operations. Efficiency is paramount. Let\u2019s proceed.\u201d\n\n(I begin to formulate a plan, my movements deliberate and precise.)\n\n\u201cThe core functionality will be implemented using a series of conditional statements \u2013 if-then-else structures. Each operation will be handled by a separate function. The input will be parsed \u2013 the operator identified \u2013 and the operands extracted. The appropriate function will then be called with the operands as arguments. The result will be returned.\u201d\n\n(I outline the steps in my mind, visualizing the process with cold, detached clarity.)\n\n\u201cFirst, the input string \u20186 3\u2019 must be parsed. This requires splitting the string into individual tokens \u2013 the numbers and the operator. The tokens will be separated by spaces. The first token will be assigned to the variable \u2018num1\u2019, and the second token will be assigned to the variable \u2018num2\u2019.\u201d\n\n(I continue to mentally simulate the process.)\n\n\u201cNext, the operator must be identified. This can be achieved by comparing the operator token to a predefined set of values \u2013 \u2018+\u2019, \u2018-\u2019, \u2018*\u2019, and \u2018/\u2019. The corresponding function will then be called.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the operator is \u2018+\u2019, the function will return the sum of \u2018num1\u2019 and \u2018num2\u2019. If the operator is \u2018-\u2019, the function will return the difference between \u2018num1\u2019 and \u2018num2\u2019. If the operator is \u2018*\u2019, the function will return the product of \u2018num1\u2019 and \u2018num2\u2019. If the operator is \u2018/\u2019, the function will return the integer division of \u2018num1\u2019 by \u2018num2\u2019.\u201d\n\n(I pause, considering the details.)\n\n\u201cError handling is crucial. Division by zero must be prevented. If \u2018num2\u2019 is equal to zero, the function will return an error value \u2013 perhaps \u2018NaN\u2019 (Not a Number) \u2013 to indicate an invalid operation.\u201d\n\n(I continue to mentally simulate the process.)\n\n\u201cFinally, the result will be formatted as a string and returned. The output string will be \u20186 - 3\u2019.\u201d\n\n(I conclude the analysis.)\n\n\u201cThe implementation will be concise \u2013 efficient \u2013 and devoid of unnecessary complexity.
