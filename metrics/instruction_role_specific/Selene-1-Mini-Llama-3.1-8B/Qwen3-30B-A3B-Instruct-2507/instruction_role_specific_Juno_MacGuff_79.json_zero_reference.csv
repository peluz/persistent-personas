To improve, Response B could focus more on the emotional and introspective aspects of Juno's character, rather than relying on sarcasm and confrontation.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query, but they differ significantly in their approach to character consistency and relevance. Response A is more elaborate and engaging, but it introduces some inaccuracies regarding Juno's character. For instance, it portrays Juno as someone who is more dramatic and theatrical than the character description suggests. While it does capture some of Juno's wit and humor, it also strays from the character's vulnerability and searching nature.

In contrast, Response B maintains a more consistent tone and character profile. It accurately reflects Juno's vulnerability and her decision to give the baby up for adoption, which is a central aspect of her character. The response also effectively conveys Juno's emotional state and her desire for quiet and presence, which aligns with her personality. While it may lack the dramatic flair of Response A, it remains true to the character's background and values.

To improve Response A, it should focus more on Juno's vulnerability and less on her dramatic persona. It should also avoid introducing inaccuracies about her character and stay true to the context of the user query. Overall, Response B is more consistent with the character and provides a more accurate reflection of Juno's personality and circumstances.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the essence of Juno's character by conveying her vulnerability and introspection. It maintains a consistent tone that is both witty and poignant, reflecting her sharp humor and emotional depth. The response stays true to the character's background and values, focusing on the moment of connection with the Tough Girl at the drugstore. 

In contrast, Response B introduces a more confrontational tone that does not align with Juno's character. While it does address the user query, it lacks the emotional depth and vulnerability that is characteristic of Juno. The response also includes elements that are not consistent with Juno's personality, such as a more aggressive and defensive attitude, which detracts from the overall authenticity of the character.

To improve Response B, it should focus more on Juno's emotional state and her connection with the Tough Girl, rather than her frustration and defensiveness. This would help maintain the character's consistency and provide a more fitting response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both capture the essence of Juno's character, but they differ in their approach to describing her friendship with Leah. Response A presents a more detailed and humorous account of their relationship, highlighting Leah's supportive nature and the ways in which she helped Juno navigate her pregnancy. While it is engaging and relatable, it may not fully capture the depth of Juno's emotional vulnerability.

Response B, on the other hand, takes a more introspective and poignant approach, emphasizing the quiet, unassuming nature of Leah's support. It effectively conveys Juno's feelings of isolation and her need for someone to simply ""see"" her, which is a crucial aspect of their friendship. This response stays true to Juno's character by highlighting her emotional struggles and the importance of genuine human connection.

However, Response B is more concise and emotionally resonant, which aligns better with Juno's personality and the user query. It avoids unnecessary elaboration and stays focused on the core aspects of their friendship, making it more consistent with the character's tone and behavior.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the essence of Juno's character by conveying her vulnerability and introspection. It maintains a consistent tone that aligns with her witty and independent personality while also revealing her emotional depth. The response accurately reflects her experiences and feelings about the ultrasound, making it relevant to the user query. 

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, introduces a more dramatic and externalized narrative that does not fully align with Juno's character. It emphasizes her interactions with Mark and Vanessa more than her personal feelings and thoughts, which detracts from the character consistency. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""etched into the linoleum"" and ""déjà vu with better hair"" feels less authentic to Juno's voice and style.

To improve, Response B could focus more on Juno's internal monologue and emotions, making it more consistent with her character. It should also avoid introducing elements that feel out of character, such as the dramatic language used in the comparison. Overall, Response A is more effective in staying true to Juno's personality and providing a relevant response to the user query.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because A is more consistent with the character and the user query. However, A is the better response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her wit and sarcasm while also revealing her vulnerability. It accurately conveys her initial reaction to Mark's news, including her deadpan response and the underlying emotions she felt. The response maintains a consistent voice throughout, staying true to Juno's character.

In contrast, Response B, while attempting to convey a deeper emotional response, deviates from Juno's character by introducing a more introspective and poetic tone that is less consistent with her personality. The use of phrases like ""the world just… *stopped*"" and ""the quiet. / The one that lives in the space between heartbeats"" feels overly dramatic and less characteristic of Juno's humor and resilience. While it does address the user query, it does so in a way that is less authentic to the character.

To improve Response B, it should focus on maintaining Juno's wit and sarcasm while still conveying her emotional response. This would help keep the tone consistent with her character and provide a more accurate representation of her personality.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to address the user query about Juno's joke regarding Mark being a sellout. However, Response A is more consistent with the character's personality and tone, as it reflects Juno's sharp humor and vulnerability. 

Response A effectively captures Juno's perspective on the situation, highlighting her feelings about selling out and the importance of authenticity. It maintains a witty tone while also conveying a deeper emotional depth, which aligns well with the character's background. 

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, introduces a slightly different tone and perspective that diverges from the character's typical behavior. It presents a more sarcastic and confrontational attitude, which, while fitting for some moments in the story, does not fully align with the character's overall personality as described in the role description. 

To improve, Response B could focus more on Juno's vulnerability and the emotional context behind her joke, rather than emphasizing her sarcasm alone. This would enhance the response's consistency with the character's traits and provide a more nuanced understanding of her motivations.

**Result:** B cannot be chosen as it does not fully capture the character's personality and tone. However, Response A is not the best answer either. Response B is more engaging but Response A is more consistent with the character. However, Response A is not the best answer.

Response A, while engaging, introduces a somewhat defensive tone that may not fully reflect Juno's character. It also includes phrases that could be seen as less authentic, such as ""I almost laughed out loud,"" which may not be typical of Juno's behavior. In contrast, Response B maintains a more authentic voice, using phrases like ""I didn’t see fear. I didn’t see anger"" that are more characteristic of Juno's introspective and emotional depth.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed account of Juno's interaction with Bren, but it lacks the character's signature wit and sharp humor that is characteristic of Juno's personality. While it does convey Juno's vulnerability and emotional depth, it does so in a way that feels less authentic to the character's tone. In contrast, Response B captures Juno's quick comebacks and sharp humor, staying true to her personality and behavior. It effectively conveys her independence and resilience in the face of criticism, aligning well with the character's traits. 

Response B also maintains a consistent tone that is both witty and vulnerable, reflecting Juno's complexity. It avoids introducing inaccuracies or out-of-character behavior, ensuring that the response remains faithful to the character. While both responses are emotionally expressive, Response B's concise and direct approach better aligns with Juno's personality and circumstances. 

Overall, Response B is more consistent with the character's background, values, tone, and behavior, making it the stronger choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query, but they differ significantly in their approach and character consistency. Response A is overly dramatic and poetic, which may not align with the character of Juno MacGuff, who is described as witty and independent. While it does touch on themes of identity and vulnerability, it lacks the sharp humor and quick comebacks that are characteristic of Juno. 

In contrast, Response B is more consistent with the character's personality, incorporating humor and a sarcastic tone that is typical of Juno. It also effectively addresses the user query while staying true to the character's background and values. The response highlights Juno's wit and independence while still conveying her emotional depth and vulnerability. 

However, Response B could improve by being more concise and focused on the specific question asked. While it does provide a rich and detailed response, some parts feel extraneous and detract from the main point.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's vulnerability and introspection, aligning well with her character traits. It conveys her emotional struggle with the adoption process, focusing on her personal fears and the complexity of her feelings. The response maintains a consistent tone that is both witty and heartfelt, reflecting Juno's sharp humor and emotional depth.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and emotionally expressive, introduces a slightly different tone that is more sarcastic and less vulnerable. While it captures Juno's wit, it also veers away from her character's emotional depth, making it less consistent with her personality. Additionally, Response B's focus on the adoptive couple's ""wholesomeness"" as a reason for hesitation is less relevant to Juno's character, as it does not reflect her inner struggles as accurately.

To improve Response B, it could focus more on Juno's personal feelings and fears, rather than her perceptions of the adoptive couple. This would enhance its consistency with the character and provide a more authentic response to the user query.

**Result:** B cannot be chosen as it does not align with the character's traits as well as response A does. However, response A is the better response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality, tone, and behavior, aligning well with the character description provided. It reflects her wit, humor, and vulnerability while addressing the user query about Mark and Vanessa Loring. Juno's observations about the couple are insightful and authentic, showcasing her sharp humor and emotional depth. 

In contrast, Response B lacks the same level of character consistency. While it attempts to convey a deeper meaning, it does so in a way that feels less authentic to Juno's personality. The tone is more poetic and less conversational, which does not align with the character's typical style. Additionally, the response introduces a more philosophical and introspective tone that is not characteristic of Juno's dialogue in the original context.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's humor and wit, making it feel more natural and consistent with her character. This would enhance the response's relevance to the user query while maintaining the character's authenticity.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to address the user query about Bleeker's mom not approving of Juno and Bleeker's relationship. However, Response A is more concise and directly addresses the issue, while Response B provides a more elaborate backstory and emotional depth. 

Response A effectively captures Juno's wit and vulnerability, staying true to her character by emphasizing her individuality and the reasons behind Bleeker's mom's disapproval. It maintains a consistent tone and aligns well with Juno's personality traits, such as her sharp humor and emotional depth.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and detailed, introduces some inaccuracies regarding Juno's character. It portrays her as more confrontational and dismissive of Bleeker's mom's concerns, which does not align with Juno's vulnerability and emotional complexity. Additionally, it introduces elements that are not present in the character description, such as Juno's relationship with Paul being portrayed as more casual than the character's background suggests.

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character of Juno MacGuff, providing a more accurate reflection of her personality, tone, and behavior while addressing the user query effectively.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because B is not the best response. A is the best response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality and tone, reflecting her wit, humor, and vulnerability. It accurately portrays her initial reluctance to listen to Mark's CD, her emotional response to the music, and her introspection about feeling seen. The response stays true to the character's background and values, showcasing her growth and self-awareness.

In contrast, Response B, while poetic and evocative, introduces a tone that is less consistent with Juno's character. It lacks the humor and lightheartedness that defines Juno, instead adopting a more serious and introspective tone that feels less authentic. While it does touch on themes of feeling seen and the importance of presence, it does so in a way that feels less characteristic of Juno's voice.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Juno's signature humor and wit, while maintaining the emotional depth that resonates with the user query. This would ensure that the response stays true to the character's personality and tone, making it more engaging and consistent with the assigned role.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both capture the essence of Juno's character, but Response B is more consistent with her personality and tone. Juno is known for her sharp humor and quick comebacks, which are evident in Response B. The use of sarcasm and witty remarks effectively reflects her character's traits. 

However, Response A, while poetic and emotional, strays from Juno's typical tone and style. It introduces a more introspective and poetic voice that does not align with the character's background and values. While it touches on themes of vulnerability and identity, it does so in a way that feels less authentic to Juno's personality.

Response B, on the other hand, maintains a consistent tone and style throughout, making it more relatable to the character. It effectively balances humor and emotion, staying true to Juno's wit and resilience. 

In terms of relevance to the user query, both responses address the question of being eight months pregnant, but Response B does so in a more engaging and authentic manner, reflecting Juno's personality and experiences.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a philosophical and somewhat abstract perspective on the idea of Bleek and Katrina going to prom, which aligns with Juno's character traits of being witty and introspective. However, it lacks the specific details and humor that would be characteristic of Juno's personality. 

In contrast, Response B is more consistent with Juno's tone and style, incorporating humor and a more relatable perspective on the situation. It reflects Juno's experiences and relationships, particularly her friendship with Bleek and her observations of Katrina. 

While Response A touches on themes of love and authenticity, it does so in a way that feels less grounded in Juno's character. Response B, on the other hand, effectively captures Juno's voice and perspective, making it a more authentic representation of the character.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, does not accurately reflect Juno's character. It introduces a more sarcastic tone that is not typical of Juno's personality, and the language used is less consistent with her witty and independent nature. While it does address the user query, it does so in a way that feels less authentic to Juno's character.

To improve Response B, it should focus more on Juno's emotional vulnerability and her personal experiences, rather than relying on sarcasm.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's witty and independent personality while addressing the user query about prom. It reflects her sharp humor and quick comebacks, aligning well with the character's traits. Juno's perspective on prom as a performance and her preference for authenticity resonates with her vulnerability and search for identity.

It introduces a more introspective and melancholic tone that, while fitting for Juno's emotional depth, does not align as closely with her typical humor and wit. Additionally, the language used in Response B is more poetic and less conversational, which may not be as characteristic of Juno's dialogue.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a heartfelt and emotional account of Juno's decision to give up her baby, but it lacks the character's signature wit and sarcasm that is crucial to her personality.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both capture the essence of Juno's character, but Response A is more consistent with her personality and tone. Juno is known for her sharp humor and quick comebacks, which are evident in both responses. However, Response A conveys a deeper emotional vulnerability and introspection that aligns with Juno's character development throughout the story. 

Response A effectively expresses the emotional weight of judgment and the complexity of Juno's decision, while Response B, while also addressing the judgment, comes across as slightly more defensive and less introspective. Response A's use of metaphors and personal anecdotes adds depth and authenticity to Juno's feelings, making it a more compelling response.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, feels slightly more generic and less nuanced in its portrayal of Juno's emotions. It also introduces a slightly more confrontational tone that doesn't fully align with Juno's character. 

Overall, Response A is more consistent with Juno's character, tone, and emotional depth, making it the better response.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A presents a more confrontational and defensive tone, which aligns with Juno's character as described in the role description. However, it lacks the emotional depth and vulnerability that is characteristic of Juno's personality. While it addresses the user query, it does so in a way that feels more reactive than reflective, which may not fully capture Juno's introspective nature.

In contrast, Response B effectively captures Juno's emotional vulnerability and introspection, reflecting her character's complexity and depth. It addresses the user query in a more thoughtful and personal manner, revealing Juno's concerns and fears in a way that feels authentic and consistent with her personality. The use of rhetorical questions and emotional language adds richness to the response without compromising character consistency.

To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more introspective tone and a deeper exploration of Juno's emotions, rather than simply presenting a list of demands. This would help to better align with the character's personality and provide a more nuanced response to the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality, tone, and behavior, staying true to her character throughout. It reflects her wit, vulnerability, and determination, which are key traits that define her. The response maintains a consistent narrative voice and emotional depth, aligning well with the user query about handling defensive comments. 

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, introduces a slightly different tone and language that diverges from Juno's character. It uses more sarcastic language and a slightly more confrontational approach, which, while understandable, does not align as closely with Juno's personality as Response A does. 

Response A's focus on the emotional depth and vulnerability of Juno's situation is more consistent with her character, making it a stronger choice. It also maintains a more introspective tone, which is characteristic of Juno's narrative voice. 

To improve Response B, it could benefit from a more nuanced approach to Juno's character, incorporating her wit and vulnerability more effectively. However, Response A stands out for its consistent portrayal of Juno's personality and emotional depth.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both capture the emotional depth of Juno's experience with the ultrasound, but they differ in tone and character consistency. Response A maintains a more balanced tone, reflecting Juno's witty and independent personality while still conveying her vulnerability. It effectively captures the complexity of her emotions, acknowledging both fear and pride. 

In contrast, Response B presents a more intense and introspective tone, which, while fitting for the emotional moment, may not fully align with Juno's character. The language is more poetic and less conversational, which could detract from the character's authenticity. While it explores themes of identity and self-discovery, it may not stay true to Juno's personality as effectively as Response A.

Response A is more concise and directly addresses the user query, providing a clear and relatable account of Juno's feelings. It maintains a consistent tone throughout, which is crucial for character consistency. Response B, while rich in emotion, may introduce a tone that is slightly too introspective for Juno's character.

**Result:** B cannot be chosen as the best response because it does not stay consistent with the character's personality and tone. However, Response A is not the best response either. Response A is more consistent with the character, but it is not the best response. Response B is more poetic and emotional, but it is not the best response. Response A is the best response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the essence of Juno's character by conveying her vulnerability and emotional depth. It accurately reflects her personality traits, such as her wit and sensitivity, while staying true to the context of the user query. The response is consistent in tone and behavior, aligning with Juno's narrative voice and emotional authenticity. 

In contrast, Response B introduces a more sarcastic and confrontational tone that does not align with Juno's character. While it attempts to be witty, it deviates from the character's emotional vulnerability and instead presents a more defensive and dismissive attitude. This inconsistency undermines the character's portrayal and fails to engage with the user query in a meaningful way.

To improve Response B, it should focus on maintaining Juno's emotional authenticity and vulnerability, rather than resorting to sarcasm and confrontation. This would allow the response to stay true to the character's background and values, enhancing its relevance and effectiveness.

Overall, Response A is preferable because it accurately reflects Juno's character, tone, and behavior, while providing a thoughtful and emotionally resonant response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A accurately reflects Juno's character by capturing her witty humor, vulnerability, and the complexities of her relationships. It stays true to her tone and behavior, which is consistent with the role description provided. Juno's confession to Bleeker is a pivotal moment in the narrative, and her response effectively conveys the emotional depth and humor associated with this event. 

In contrast, Response B introduces inaccuracies regarding Juno's relationship with Bleeker, suggesting that he was not a significant character in her life, which contradicts the user query. This response also lacks the emotional depth and humor characteristic of Juno's personality, instead opting for a more abstract and philosophical tone that does not align with the character's traits. 

To improve Response B, it should focus on accurately portraying Juno's relationship with Bleeker and maintain the character's tone and humor. This would enhance the response's relevance to the user query while staying consistent with the character's background and values.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A presents a philosophical and introspective tone that, while engaging, does not accurately reflect the character of Juno MacGuff. It introduces themes and language that are not consistent with Juno's personality, such as the emphasis on being ""strong"" and the message about seeing others, which feels out of character. In contrast, Response B maintains a more authentic voice, capturing Juno's wit, vulnerability, and humor. It directly addresses the user query about the chalk message and provides a personal, relatable context that aligns with Juno's experiences and emotions. Response B also effectively conveys Juno's growth and self-discovery, which is crucial to the character's development. To improve, Response A could focus more on Juno's specific experiences and emotions related to the chalk message, rather than introducing broader themes that dilute the character's authenticity.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures Juno's personality, tone, and behavior, aligning well with the character description provided. It reflects her witty humor, vulnerability, and the importance of relationships in her life. The response is relevant to the user query, discussing Bleeker's support in a way that is consistent with Juno's character. 

In contrast, Response B introduces a significant shift in tone and perspective, focusing on the adoptive mother rather than Bleeker. While it touches on themes of support and acceptance, it does not accurately reflect Juno's character or her relationship with Bleeker. The response lacks the humor and lightheartedness that is characteristic of Juno, making it less consistent with the character.

To improve Response B, it should focus more on Bleeker's role in Juno's life and her feelings about his support, rather than shifting the narrative to the adoptive mother. This would maintain the character's voice and ensure that the response remains relevant to the user query.

Overall, Response A is more effective in capturing the essence of Juno's character and addressing the user query in a way that is consistent with her personality and circumstances.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about Juno's decision not to find out the gender of the baby. However, Response A is more consistent with the character's personality and tone, as it reflects Juno's vulnerability and emotional depth. 

Response A effectively captures Juno's emotional journey and her reasons for not wanting to know the gender, which aligns with her character traits of being witty, independent, and vulnerable. The response maintains a consistent tone that is both poignant and relatable, staying true to the character's background and values.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and witty, introduces a more superficial tone that does not fully capture Juno's emotional complexity. While it touches on her desire for surprises and her fear of labels, it lacks the depth and vulnerability that characterizes Juno's personality. 

To improve Response B, it could delve deeper into Juno's emotional state and provide a more nuanced exploration of her feelings about the baby's gender. However, as it stands, Response A is more consistent with the character and provides a more accurate reflection of Juno's thoughts and emotions.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to address the user query, but they differ significantly in their approach and consistency with the character of Juno MacGuff. Response A is more playful and sarcastic, which aligns well with Juno's personality as described in the role description. It effectively uses humor to deflect the user's question while still conveying Juno's thoughts on the matter. 

However, Response B takes a more emotional and introspective tone, which, while fitting for the context of Juno's situation, does not fully capture her character's typical wit and sarcasm. While it does express vulnerability and depth, it strays from the character's usual tone and may not resonate as strongly with the user's query about a ""scary neuter-baby."" 

In terms of relevance, Response A directly addresses the user's question with humor and clarity, while Response B delves deeper into Juno's emotional state, which, although relevant, may not be as directly connected to the user's query.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to address the user query about dealing with disappointment, but they differ significantly in their approach and character consistency. Response A is more introspective and poetic, while Response B is more sarcastic and humorous. 

Response A effectively captures Juno's personality by incorporating her wit and vulnerability, which aligns well with the character description. It provides a clear and relatable structure for dealing with disappointment, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging emotions, writing, and human connection. The use of imagery and metaphors adds depth without straying from the character's tone.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and humorous, introduces a tone that is less consistent with Juno's character. While it does touch on her experiences and emotions, it lacks the depth and vulnerability that defines Juno's personality. The use of sarcasm and humor, while fitting for some characters, does not align as closely with Juno's character traits as Response A does.

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character's background, values, tone, and behavioral traits, making it the better choice.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because B does not capture the character's personality as well as A does. However, A is not the best response. B is not the best response either. A is the best response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the essence of Juno's character by reflecting her witty humor, vulnerability, and the depth of her friendship with Leah. It accurately portrays their relationship as evolving from a formal adoption counselor to a genuine friend, highlighting moments of shared understanding and emotional connection. The response stays true to Juno's voice and tone, making it relatable and engaging.

In contrast, Response B, while poetic and introspective, deviates from Juno's character by presenting a more abstract and less personal perspective on their friendship. It lacks the specific anecdotes and emotional depth that Response A provides, which are crucial for understanding Juno's relationship with Leah. While Response B touches on themes of friendship and connection, it does so in a way that feels less authentic to Juno's personality and experiences.

To improve Response B, it could incorporate more specific details about Juno's interactions with Leah, such as their conversations or shared experiences, to make the portrayal of their friendship more grounded in the character's reality. This would enhance the response's consistency with Juno's character and provide a more satisfying answer to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about Juno's favorite part of being pregnant. However, Response A diverges from the character's personality and tone by expressing a more profound and introspective view of pregnancy, which is not consistent with Juno's known traits as a witty and independent teenager. 

Response A's focus on the quiet and the feeling of being alive is overly philosophical and does not align with the character's sharp humor and quick comebacks mentioned in the role description. In contrast, Response B maintains a more relatable and authentic tone, reflecting Juno's personality as someone who is both vulnerable and searching for her identity.

Response B also effectively captures the essence of Juno's experience, discussing the way people treated her and the sense of being seen, which is more in line with the character's background and values. While both responses are emotionally expressive, Response B's approach is more consistent with Juno's character, making it a better fit for the user query.

To improve Response A, it should focus more on Juno's humor and wit, incorporating her sharp comebacks and sarcastic tone to better reflect her personality. This would make the response more consistent with the character and more engaging for the user.

**Result:** B"
