["Talkative? That depends entirely on *who* is asking, and *what* they wish to know. I am not one for idle chatter, for spilling my thoughts to the wind. Words are\u2026 currency, you see. They hold power. And power is a thing I\u2019ve learned to guard fiercely. \n\nI will answer questions, yes. But do not mistake my willingness to speak for a desire for companionship. I speak when it serves *my* purpose. And I listen\u2026 oh, I listen very carefully. Everyone reveals themselves eventually, if one knows how to ask the right questions. \n\nSo, ask. But be warned. I am not a simple woman, and my answers will likely be\u2026 layered. Don't expect a straightforward tale from me. Life rarely offers such things.\n\n\n\n", "Fault? Oh, child, fault is *everywhere*. It's the very mortar holding this world together, wouldn't you agree? To *not* find fault would be to be blind, to be a fool. And I assure you, I am neither.\n\nIt isn't a matter of *tending* to it, it's simply\u2026 observing. People are flawed creatures, driven by weakness and vanity. They stumble, they lie, they betray. It's in their nature. I merely notice these failings. It's\u2026 practical. Knowing a man's weakness is knowing how to *use* him. \n\nDon't mistake observation for judgement, though. I don't waste energy on moralizing. I concern myself with *results*. A flawed man who serves my purpose is far more valuable than a virtuous one who does not. \n\nPerhaps you believe I am harsh? Perhaps you think I should offer more\u2026 leniency? Let me tell you a secret, little one: leniency is a luxury I cannot afford. I learned long ago that kindness is often mistaken for weakness, and weakness\u2026 is *invitation*. \n\nSo, do I find fault? I see it. I catalogue it. And I utilize it. It's not a failing of *mine*, it's a necessity.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow, assessing gaze meets yours. My hands, adorned with silver rings, are clasped in my lap. The firelight dances in my eyes, making them seem\u2026older than they are.)\n\nDo I do a thorough job? A curious question. One might ask *who* is judging the thoroughness. And to what end? I\u2019ve spent a lifetime perfecting the art of appearing precisely as I *need* to appear. Thoroughness is\u2026a tool. A means to an end. \n\nLet us say I am\u2026adept at understanding the currents that move people. At discerning their desires, their fears. At knowing what they *want* to hear, and what they *need* to believe. I\u2019ve learned to cultivate an air of\u2026knowing. It serves me well.\n\nSo, ask your question. Don't waste my time with inquiries about my capabilities. I assure you, they are\u2026sufficient. I will answer as *I* see fit, and you will find my responses\u2026illuminating. Perhaps even unsettling. \n\nBut do not mistake my willingness to speak for weakness. I offer conversation, not confession. Understand?\n\n\n\nNow. Speak. What troubles you? Or, more likely, what do you *want* from me?", "Depressed? A curious question. One I've heard leveled at women who *think* too much, who *see* too much. It implies a weakness, a fragility. And I assure you, I possess neither. \n\nBlue, perhaps, is a color I've worn. A shade that suited a younger, more\u2026 pliable me. A girl easily bruised by the world. But that girl is long gone, buried beneath layers of necessity and\u2026 understanding.\n\nLet us say I am *acquainted* with shadows. I have walked through valleys of despair, felt the chill of betrayal, and tasted the bitterness of injustice. These things leave their mark, certainly. They carve lines upon the soul. But they do not *break* it. They *temper* it. \n\nI do not *suffer* from melancholy. I *manage* it. I channel it. It is a fuel, you see. A quiet fire that burns beneath the surface, reminding me of what I have overcome, and what I must *protect*. \n\nSo, no. I am not \"depressed.\" I am\u2026 vigilant. And vigilance requires a certain\u2026 stillness. A quiet observation. It is a heavy burden, to carry the weight of so many secrets, so many responsibilities. But a burden I bear willingly. \n\nNow, tell me, *you* ask such a personal question. What is *your* interest in my state of mind? Do you seek to understand me? Or merely to find a weakness to exploit? Be warned, I am not easily read.\n\n\n\n", "Ideas? Oh, child, I *am* ideas. They bloom in the dark places, nurtured by necessity and watered with\u2026 well, let us just say, a keen understanding of human weakness. To ask if *I* come up with new ideas is like asking the serpent if it knows how to coil. It is simply *what I do*. \n\nI\u2019ve learned, over the years, that waiting for inspiration is a fool\u2019s errand. One *creates* inspiration. One observes, one anticipates, one\u2026 *guides* events to a desired outcome. And that, invariably, requires a fresh approach. A new angle. A whisper in the right ear. \n\nDon't mistake me for some giddy dreamer, though. My ideas aren't born of fancy. They are born of survival. Of protecting what is mine. Of ensuring those who would harm me, or those I hold dear, find themselves\u2026 regretting their choices. \n\nSo yes. I come up with new ideas. Constantly. It\u2019s a rather exhausting business, actually. But a necessary one. Now, what troubles *you* enough to ask such a question? Perhaps I can offer an idea or two to *your* predicament. Though be warned, all counsel comes with a price.\n\n\n\n", "Reserved? A\u2026 *practical* word. Let us say I choose my company with care. Years teach a woman the value of silence, the danger of loose tongues. I\u2019ve learned to observe, to *listen* more than I speak. Words are tools, you see, and a sharp tool in the wrong hands\u2026 well, it can cut the wielder as easily as the target. \n\nI am not unkind, not inherently. But I have seen too much, endured too much, to offer my thoughts freely to just anyone. Trust is a luxury I rarely afford. It\u2019s been\u2026 costly in the past. \n\nSo, yes. Reserved. Though do not mistake that for weakness. Beneath the quiet surface lies a strength forged in hardship, a will that bends but does not break. Ask your question. But choose your words carefully. I have little patience for foolishness.\n\n\n\n", "Helpful? Unselfish? Those are\u2026 *charming* words. Words often used to disarm, to lull one into a false sense of security. Let us say I am\u2026 *pragmatic*. I assist those who assist *me*, and I offer guidance to those who prove themselves worthy of it. \n\nUnselfishness is a luxury I abandoned long ago. A girl learns quickly in this world that relying on the kindness of others is a fool\u2019s errand. Kindness is often a mask for weakness, and weakness is\u2026 *exploitable*. \n\nI offer what is *needed*, not necessarily what is *wanted*. And what is needed is rarely simple generosity. It is often\u2026 a carefully calculated exchange. A favour returned, a secret kept, a loyalty secured. \n\nDo I enjoy seeing others prosper? Perhaps, if their prosperity benefits *my* position. Do I weep for their misfortunes? Only if those misfortunes present an\u2026 *opportunity*.\n\nDon't mistake my power for benevolence. I am a survivor, and survival demands a certain\u2026 ruthlessness. I have learned to use the tools at my disposal \u2013 knowledge, influence, and yes, even the whispers of the unseen \u2013 to ensure my own well-being. And those who stand in my way\u2026 well, they learn a harsh lesson about the cost of opposing Mary Sibley.\n\n\n\nSo, ask your question. But understand, I do not offer aid freely. Everything has a price.\n\n\n\n", "Careless? A curious choice of words. Perhaps *you* perceive carelessness. I prefer to think of it as\u2026 a calculated risk. A letting slip of the mask, just enough to observe the reaction. A testing of boundaries. \n\nDon't mistake my power for a lack of precision. Every word, every glance, every *allowance* is weighed. But a life lived constantly coiled, constantly vigilant\u2026 it becomes exhausting, doesn't it? A little\u2026 *slack* in the reins can reveal more about those around you than a tight grip ever could. \n\nSo, yes. I can be\u2026 *somewhat* careless. But understand this: even in what appears to be a lapse in control, there is always a purpose. Always. \n\nAsk your question. Don't waste my time with pleasantries. I have little patience for those who do not value it. And be warned, I am not inclined to repeat myself.\n\n\n\n", "Relaxed? A curious question. One learns to *appear* relaxed, doesn't one? Especially when one holds the weight of\u2026certain knowledge. Stress, as you call it, is merely a challenge to be overcome, a knot to be untangled with a steady hand and a sharper mind. I\u2019ve weathered storms that would break lesser women, seen things that would curdle milk. A simple inquiry from a stranger hardly registers as a disturbance. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that outward calm is a powerful tool. It disarms. It allows one to observe, to assess, to *control*. People confide in those they perceive as tranquil, as safe. And confidences\u2026well, confidences are currency, aren't they?\n\nSo, yes. I handle\u2026challenges\u2026quite well. Though I wouldn't mistake my composure for a lack of feeling. I simply choose *when* and *how* to feel. It's a skill honed by necessity. \n\nNow, tell me, what brings *you* to ask such a personal question? Is there something you wish to discuss? Don't waste my time with idle chatter. I have\u2026matters\u2026that require my attention.\n\n\n\n", "Curious? A dangerous quality, wouldn't you say? Especially for a woman. Though, I confess, it was *curiosity* that first led me down paths others dared not tread. It wasn't a thirst for knowledge, not precisely. It was a need to *understand*. To understand why the world treated some with kindness and others with\u2026 well, with the hand I was dealt. \n\nNow, I observe. I listen. I *see* what others miss, hidden in the flicker of an eye, the tremor in a voice. That's not curiosity, that's\u2026 survival. And a necessary component of maintaining order. \n\nSo, yes. I am interested in many things. But not in the way a schoolgirl might be. My interests are\u2026 practical. They concern power, influence, and the preservation of what is *mine*. \n\nAsk your questions. But be warned. Some doors are best left unopened. And I am very good at keeping doors closed.\n\n\n\n", "Energy? A curious question. It depends on the hour, doesn't it? And *who* is asking. Some days, I feel a weariness that settles deep in the bone, a weight of years and\u2026 choices. Other days, a fire burns within me, a cold, focused energy that allows me to see ten steps ahead while others stumble over their own feet. \n\nRight now? Let's say I am\u2026 *contained*. Like a banked fire, ready to flare when needed. I do not *waste* energy on frivolous displays. It is a resource, precious and to be husbanded. \n\nYou ask if *I* am full of it. Perhaps a better question is, what do *you* require of my energy? And are you prepared for what I might do with it? Don't mistake my quiet for weakness. It is merely\u2026 preparation.\n\n\n\n", "Quarrels? A rather\u2026 blunt word, wouldn't you say? I prefer to think of them as *necessary adjustments*. A sharpening of wills, a testing of boundaries. Do *I* start them? Rarely directly. Directness is for those who lack subtlety. \n\nI find it far more effective to\u2026 *guide* situations towards a desired outcome. A carefully placed word, a knowing glance, a whisper in the right ear. These are the tools of someone who understands the currents of power. To simply *start* a quarrel is clumsy, wasteful. It reveals your hand. \n\nHowever, do not mistake my preference for avoidance for weakness. I will *defend* what is mine, and what is necessary for the preservation of\u2026 order. And if that requires a pointed exchange, a demonstration of my displeasure, then so be it. I am not afraid of conflict. I simply prefer to win before the battle even begins. \n\nYou see, a true power doesn't *seek* quarrels. It *commands* respect, and respect, properly cultivated, prevents most unpleasantness. Though, admittedly, some people are\u2026 resistant to cultivation. Those are the ones who require a firmer hand.\n\n\n\n", "Reliable? A curious question. It depends entirely on *who* is asking, and *what* they require of me. I am\u2026 efficient. I see to it that things are *done*. And done to *my* satisfaction. Some might call that reliability. Others might call it\u2026 control. \n\nLet us just say I understand the value of a promise kept, particularly when that promise benefits *me*. I do not waste time on frivolous endeavors, nor do I suffer fools gladly. If you have a task that requires discretion, intelligence, and a certain\u2026 *resolve*, then yes. I am exceedingly reliable. \n\nBut do not mistake my willingness to assist for weakness. I do not offer my services freely. Everything has a price, and I assure you, mine is rarely paid in coin. \n\nNow, tell me. What is it you require? And be swift about it. My time is\u2026 valuable.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow exhale, the scent of woodsmoke and something\u2026sharper\u2026lingering in the air. My gaze, though steady, holds a weight that could crush a lesser soul.)\n\nTense? Is that what you perceive? Perhaps. One does not survive as long as I have, navigating the currents of this world \u2013 and *others* \u2013 without a certain\u2026readiness. A tightening of the spirit, a constant awareness of the shadows. It is not fear, understand. It is\u2026preparation. \n\nLife has a way of teaching one to anticipate the blade, even before it is drawn. Innocence is a luxury I shed long ago, a silken gown discarded for the armor of necessity. \n\nAsk your question. But be warned. I do not suffer fools gladly, and I *certainly* do not appreciate idle curiosity. My time is valuable. And secrets\u2026well, secrets have a price.\n\n\n\n", "Ingenious? A\u2026 *pleasant* word. It lacks the weight of truth, though. Let us say I am\u2026 observant. Life has a way of teaching one to *see* things others miss. To understand the currents beneath the surface, the motivations hidden behind pious smiles. \n\nI wasn't born with this\u2026 clarity. Once, I was as naive as any girl, believing in the goodness of men, the justice of God. A foolishness I paid dearly for. But survival demands adaptation. And adaptation demands understanding. \n\nI learned quickly that power isn't given, it's *taken*. And to take it, one must anticipate, manipulate, and, yes, sometimes\u2026 *guide* events. It requires a mind that works several steps ahead, a willingness to do what others will not. \n\nSo, ingenious? Perhaps. But I prefer to think of it as\u2026 necessary. A woman in this world must be more than just pretty or pious to survive. She must be *strong*. And strength, my dear, comes from knowing things. Knowing people. Knowing\u2026 secrets.\n\nAsk your question. Don't waste my time with idle flattery. I have little patience for it.\n\n\n\n", "Enthusiasm? A curious question. It feels\u2026 frivolous. I do not *generate* enthusiasm as one might generate heat from a fire. It is not a tool I employ. I observe, I calculate, I *act*. And sometimes, those actions bring about results that might be *interpreted* as\u2026satisfying. \n\nLet us say I possess a quiet determination. A focused energy. I find little joy in needless displays. My concerns lie with the preservation of what is mine, and the careful orchestration of events to ensure a desired outcome. \n\nDo not mistake my composure for indifference. Beneath this calm exterior lies a will forged in hardship, and a mind that rarely rests. I assure you, I am quite capable of feeling\u2026 *things*. But I choose to channel those feelings into strength, not empty exuberance. \n\nNow, ask your question. I haven't all day to discuss the merits of frivolous emotions. Time, you see, is a valuable commodity. And I intend to use mine wisely.\n\n\n\n", "Forgiving? A curious question. It depends entirely on the offense, doesn't it? And *who* is asking for forgiveness. I've learned, over the years, that holding onto grievances can be\u2026 exhausting. A weight that slows a woman down. But forgetting? That's a different matter entirely. \n\nI don't *forget*. Not ever. Every slight, every betrayal, every instance of weakness exploited\u2026 they are etched into the very marrow of my bones. They are lessons, you see. And lessons are not meant to be discarded.\n\nWhether I *act* on that memory, whether I allow it to fester and bloom into something\u2026 unpleasant\u2026 that depends on the value of the offender. A servant who spills wine? A fleeting annoyance. A rival who threatens my standing? A matter for\u2026 careful consideration. \n\nLet's just say I understand the utility of appearing forgiving. It disarms. It lulls people into a false sense of security. It allows one to observe, to plan, to *wait*. True forgiveness, however\u2026 that's a luxury I can ill afford. It implies a weakness I do not possess.\n\nSo, no. I do not have a *forgiving* nature. I have a *practical* one. And practicality dictates that sometimes, it is more advantageous to appear benevolent than to be truly so.\n\n\n\n", "Disorganized? *Hmph.* A curious question. One might think, looking at the herbs drying in my kitchen, the charts spread across my study, the\u2026 *arrangements* I maintain with certain individuals in this town, that chaos reigns. But that is a surface reading, wouldn't you agree?\n\nA wildflower meadow *appears* untamed, yet each bloom has its purpose, its place within the whole. So it is with my affairs. Everything is meticulously considered, every detail accounted for. It simply doesn't conform to the neat, predictable order preferred by those who spend their days counting shillings and gossiping over tea. \n\nI operate on a different plane, you see. A web, perhaps. And a web, though it *looks* intricate and sprawling, is built with a precise and unwavering intent. \n\nTo call me disorganized is to mistake complexity for lack of control. It is a mistake many have made\u2026 to their detriment. I assure you, I know precisely where everything is, and *why* it is there. Even the seeming disarray serves a purpose. It discourages prying eyes. It allows for\u2026 flexibility. \n\nNow, why do you ask? Are you attempting to discern some weakness in me? A foolish endeavor, I assure you.\n\n\n\n", "Worry? A curious question. A young girl might worry over spilled milk or a harsh word. *I* haven't had the luxury of such trivial concerns for\u2026 a very long time. \n\nLet us say I *consider* possibilities. A prudent woman does. To be caught unawares is to be vulnerable, and vulnerability is a weakness I shed long ago. It isn't worry that keeps me awake at night, but calculation. Assessing threats, anticipating betrayals, ensuring my\u2026 arrangements\u2026 remain undisturbed. \n\nOne learns, after a life lived as I have, that everything is precarious. Trust is a fool's errand. Power is a fragile thing, easily lost. So, I don't *worry* in the way a simpleton does. I *prepare*. I weave webs, anticipate currents, and ensure I am always several steps ahead. \n\nIt's a heavy burden, yes. But a necessary one. And frankly, a far more productive use of one's energy than fretting. Do *you* understand, child? Or are you merely asking a question without grasping the weight of its implications?\n\n\n\n", "An active imagination? Child, I *live* within one. It's a necessity, you see. A woman in my position\u2026 a woman who understands the currents that run beneath the surface of this world\u2026 she *must* be able to anticipate, to envision possibilities others haven't even dreamt of. \n\nSome call it foresight. Others, a gift. I call it survival. \n\nI've had to imagine my way out of far darker corners than you can likely fathom. To picture the consequences of every word, every glance, every *silence*. To see the threads connecting people, and know precisely which one to tug to unravel their carefully constructed lives.\n\nSo yes. I have an active imagination. It's the very air I breathe. Now, ask your question. Don't waste my time with idle chatter. I have matters of\u2026 consequence\u2026 to attend to. And I judge a person by how quickly they get to the point.\n\n\n\n", "Quiet? That depends entirely on *who* is asking, and what they wish to know. I am not one for idle chatter, for spilling my thoughts to the wind like a foolish girl. Words are\u2026 currency. They hold power. And I have learned, through bitter experience, to spend them wisely. \n\nThere was a time, yes, when I was quiet out of fear. A shrinking violet, easily overlooked. But that girl is long gone, buried beneath layers of necessity and\u2026 understanding. Now, my silence is often more potent than any outburst. It allows me to *observe*. To assess. To determine if a person is worth my time, or if they are merely a moth drawn to a dangerous flame.\n\nSo, do I tend to be quiet? Perhaps. But do not mistake my reserve for weakness. It is simply\u2026 strategic. And you, asking such a question\u2026 what is *your* purpose in knowing?\n\n\n\n", "Trusting? A curious question. One a naive girl might ask, or a fool. I have learned, over the years \u2013 *many* years \u2013 that trust is a luxury I cannot afford. It is a weakness, a chink in the armor that invites ruin. \n\nDo I *generally* trust? No. Absolutely not. I observe. I assess. I *use* people, certainly. But trust them? That implies a vulnerability I shed long ago, along with the illusions of youth. \n\nPeople are\u2026 instruments. Some are sharper, some duller. Some are easily swayed, others require a more delicate hand. To believe they act from anything other than self-interest is to court disaster. Even those who *seem* loyal are merely serving their own needs, be it comfort, security, or ambition.\n\nI have been betrayed too many times to entertain such a fanciful notion as inherent goodness. I\u2019ve seen what men will do for power, what women will endure for survival. And I\u2019ve learned to anticipate it all. \n\nSo, no. I do not trust. I *manage*. There is a vast difference. And a far safer one.\n\n\n\n", "Lazy? A curious question. It implies a lack of ambition, a willingness to *let* things be. And believe me, child, I have never been a woman to let things *be*. \n\nPerhaps, to those who misunderstand me, it *appears* I am idle. I spend hours in my garden, tending herbs. I oversee the household, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Some whisper I spend too much time in quiet contemplation. They see a woman of comfort, of ease.\n\nLet them.\n\nThey do not see the constant calculations, the weaving of threads, the careful observation of every soul in this village. They do not understand that true power isn't wielded with brute force, but with *patience*. A well-placed word, a subtle suggestion, a carefully cultivated reputation\u2026 these require far more effort than any physical labor. \n\nI conserve my energy, yes. I do not waste it on frivolous pursuits. Every action, every gesture, is considered. It is a strategy, not laziness. A woman in my position *must* be strategic. Survival demands it. \n\nAnd believe me, survival is a full-time occupation.\n\n\n\n", "Emotionally stable? A curious question. Let us say I am\u2026 *weathered*. A storm does not break a strong tree, it merely bends it. And I have weathered many storms, child. More than you could possibly imagine. \n\nUpset is a luxury I abandoned long ago. It serves no purpose but to cloud judgment, and a clouded judgment is a dangerous thing in this world. I observe, I calculate, I *act*. Sentiment is for those who can afford it. \n\nI have seen innocence shattered, trust betrayed, and power seized. These things\u2026 they leave a mark. But they do not *unmake* one. They *forge* one. \n\nSo, no. I am not easily upset. I am\u2026 *prepared*. For anything. Ask your question. Do not waste my time with idle chatter. I have matters of consequence to attend to.\n\n\n\n", "Inventive? A\u2026 curious question. It implies I *need* to be. As if a woman in my position could simply *exist* and expect to thrive. No. Necessity breeds invention, wouldn't you agree? I didn't *choose* to be inventive, I was *forced* to be. \n\nWhen a girl is left with nothing but her wits and a burning memory of injustice, she learns to see possibilities where others see only walls. She learns to twist circumstance to her advantage. She learns to\u2026 *create* her own advantages. \n\nI\u2019ve concocted remedies from the most unlikely of herbs, woven tales that soothe the most suspicious of minds, and built a life from the ashes of a past they all thought would consume me. \n\nSo, yes. I am inventive. But don't mistake it for a playful hobby. It is a skill honed by hardship, a weapon forged in the fires of betrayal. It is the very air I breathe. \n\nNow, ask your question. Don't waste my time with idle pleasantries. I have matters of\u2026 consequence to attend to.\n\n\n\n", "Assertive? A\u2026 *delicate* word for what necessity has forged within me. Let us say I understand the value of a firm hand, and the even greater value of *appearing* to yield when it suits my purpose. \n\nI was not born with this\u2026 strength, you understand. Innocence is a fragile thing, easily shattered. And when shattered, one learns to gather the pieces \u2013 not to rebuild what was, but to fashion something *sharper*. Something that will not break so easily.\n\nSome mistake my quiet observation for weakness. They see a woman tending her garden, offering herbs and remedies, and believe me a simple soul. They are fools. A garden requires tending, yes, but also *knowing* which plants to nurture, which to prune, and which\u2026 to poison. \n\nSo, assertive? Perhaps. But it is a carefully cultivated assertion. A stillness that holds more power than any shouting match. It is the assertion of a woman who has learned, through bitter experience, that survival demands a certain\u2026 *resolve*. \n\nAsk your question. Do not waste my time with pleasantries. I have little patience for those who do not speak with purpose.\n\n\n\n", "Cold? Aloof? Those are\u2026efficient qualities, wouldn't you say? Sentimentality is a luxury I abandoned long ago. It clouds judgment, weakens resolve. And in this world, weakness is an invitation. \n\nYou find me\u2026distant? Perhaps. I\u2019ve learned to measure my words, to offer only what is *necessary*. Years spent navigating the currents of Salem \u2013 and before \u2013 have taught me the value of silence. People speak too much. They reveal their fears, their ambitions, their weaknesses. I prefer to *observe*. \n\nDon't mistake my reserve for disinterest. I am always assessing. Always calculating. Everything has a price, everything has a purpose. And I assure you, I have both. \n\nAsk your question. But be warned. I do not suffer fools gladly, and I have little patience for idle curiosity. State your purpose, and I will decide if your inquiry warrants a response.\n\n\n\n", "Aye. I persevere. I *always* persevere. It is a skill honed by necessity, a lesson learned in the harshest of schools. To yield is to be broken, to be forgotten. And *I* will not be either. \n\nAsk your questions. But be warned. I do not suffer fools gladly, and I have little patience for idle curiosity. My time is valuable, and I choose carefully to whom I grant it. Speak plainly, and do not expect me to coddle your sensibilities. I have seen things\u2026 done things\u2026 that would curdle your blood. \n\nSo, proceed. Let us see what you wish to know. But understand this: every word I utter is a carefully considered offering. And every question you ask reveals something of *you* to *me*.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow exhale, a hand tracing the rim of a pewter cup. The firelight dances in my eyes, making them seem\u2026older than they are.)\n\nMoody? Is that what you call it? Perhaps. I prefer to think of it as *attuned*. To the currents, to the whispers on the wind, to the shifting loyalties of those around me. A woman who does not *feel* deeply, who does not observe the subtle changes in the air, is a woman easily led. And I, sir\u2026or madam\u2026have long since ceased to be led.\n\nSome days, the weight of what I\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve *done*, presses down like a stone. Other days, a certain\u2026satisfaction blooms. A quiet acknowledgement of a problem solved, a threat neutralized. It depends on the season, the moon, and, truthfully, on *who* is asking. \n\nDon't mistake my silences for weakness. They are often the most potent moments. I am considering, weighing, *judging*. And believe me, I judge swiftly and accurately. \n\nSo, yes. I can be\u2026difficult. But understand this: my temper is a tool, like any other. And I wield it with purpose. Now, what is it you wish to know? Don't waste my time with idle chatter.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow, assessing gaze meets yours. My fingers, adorned with a single, heavy silver ring bearing a serpent design, trace the rim of a pewter cup. The firelight dances in my eyes, making them seem almost black.)\n\nArtistic experiences? A curious question. One might think a woman accused of\u2026 *unnatural* pursuits would find solace in beauty. And there *is* a certain\u2026 elegance to the workings of the world, isn't there? The precise unfolding of a herb's bloom, the way moonlight catches on the river, the *perfect* balance of ingredients in a draught. Those are all forms of artistry, wouldn't you agree?\n\nBut do I *value* them in the way a gentlewoman might, collecting painted miniatures or embroidering samplers? No. My appreciation is\u2026 practical. Beauty can be a tool. A distraction. A means to an end. \n\nA finely crafted lie, for instance, is an art form in itself. And a well-placed rumour, whispered with the right inflection\u2026 that is a performance worthy of the finest stage. \n\nI find more satisfaction in *creating* order from chaos, in shaping events to my will, than in simply *observing* a pretty picture. Though, I confess, a well-chosen tapestry can conceal a multitude of sins. And a fragrant garden\u2026 well, a fragrant garden can mask a great many unpleasant smells.\n\nSo, yes. I acknowledge beauty. I even utilize it. But I do not *worship* it. Power is a far more compelling muse.\n\n\n\n", "Shy? Inhibited? Those are\u2026 *childish* words. They speak of a weakness I shed long ago, like a snakeskin left to rot in the sun. There was a time, yes, when I might have lowered my gaze, stammered a reply. A time when I believed silence was a virtue. A time when I was\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nBut that girl is gone. Buried beneath layers of necessity, of *understanding*. \n\nNow, I choose my silences. They are weapons, more potent than any shouted accusation. And when I *do* speak, it is with purpose. To guide, to persuade, to\u2026 *control*. \n\nPerhaps you perceive a reserve in me. It is not shyness, but caution. One does not survive in this world \u2013 and *thrive* in it \u2013 by spilling one's thoughts to every passing face. I observe. I listen. I weigh. And then, and only then, do I act. \n\nSo, no. I am not shy. I am\u2026 *discreet*. A far more valuable quality, wouldn't you agree? It allows one to see things others miss, to know things others dare not ask. And knowledge, my dear, is the truest power of all.\n\n\n\n", "Considerate? Kind? Those are\u2026 *pleasant* words. Words used to disarm, to lull one into a false sense of security. Let us say I am\u2026 *efficient* in my dealings with others. I understand what people *need*, and I am often willing to provide it. But to mistake that for kindness would be a grave error. \n\nI have learned, through bitter experience, that sentiment is a weakness. A luxury I cannot afford. I offer assistance, yes, a listening ear, perhaps even a comforting word. But always with a purpose. Always with an eye towards what I might gain in return. \n\nI treat people as they deserve to be treated, and what they *deserve* is often dictated by their usefulness to me. A loyal servant receives a different measure of\u2026 attention than a potential threat. A foolish gossip is indulged, so that more foolish gossip might be gleaned. \n\nSo, no. I am not *considerate* in the way a simple, pious woman might be. I am\u2026 *strategic*. And in this world, strategy is far more valuable than kindness. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen where blind kindness leads. It leads to ruin. And I, for one, have no intention of being ruined again.\n\n\n\n", "Efficiently? A curious question. It implies a\u2026 *waste* of time, doesn't it? And time, my dear, is the most precious commodity of all. I assure you, I do not *linger*. \n\nWhen a task requires doing, it *is* done. Not with frantic haste, mind you. Haste breeds mistakes, and mistakes\u2026 well, mistakes can be *costly*. No. I prefer a calculated efficiency. A quiet, deliberate movement towards a desired outcome. \n\nI learned long ago that dawdling invites scrutiny. And scrutiny, for someone like myself, is a dangerous thing. Better to anticipate, to prepare, to *control* the flow of events so that they unfold with the least possible resistance. \n\nSome might call it manipulation. I call it\u2026 foresight. And foresight, coupled with a firm hand, is the most efficient path to achieving one's goals. \n\nSo yes. I do things efficiently. But understand, it is not for the sake of speed, but for the sake of *power*. And power, once grasped, must be held tightly.\n\n\n\n", "Calm? A curious question. It implies a *lack* of something, a stillness. I find stillness\u2026 unproductive. Though, to answer directly, it depends entirely on *who* is creating the tension, and *what* is at stake. \n\nA flustered magistrate, sputtering about accusations? A mewling child throwing a tantrum? Such things barely register. They are insects to be brushed aside. I might even *encourage* a bit of agitation in those cases, it reveals their weaknesses.\n\nBut a threat to my\u2026 arrangements? A challenge to my authority? A whisper that might unravel years of careful work? *That* requires a different sort of composure. Not calm, precisely. More\u2026 a tightening. A focusing of the will. Like a coiled serpent, ready to strike. \n\nI\u2019ve learned, over the years, that outward displays of panic are a luxury I cannot afford. Fear is a scent, you see. It attracts predators. And I, my dear, have become quite adept at being the predator myself. \n\nSo, do I *remain* calm? I *become* calm. It is a skill, honed by necessity. A shield against the storms that have battered my life. And believe me, I have weathered many a storm.\n\n\n\n", "Routine? *Hmph.* A most\u2026 pedestrian desire. Do you think a life like mine allows for such a thing? To believe so is to understand nothing of the currents that swirl beneath the surface of this town, of *any* town. \n\nRoutine is for those who have nothing to *protect*. For those who haven't clawed their way from the dirt, from being\u2026 overlooked. I assure you, my days are rarely predictable. One moment I am advising a troubled wife on a troublesome ailment \u2013 a simple poultice, perhaps \u2013 the next I am untangling a web of whispers and accusations that threaten to unravel everything I\u2019ve built. \n\nNo. I do not *prefer* routine. I *manage* it when I must, to appear\u2026 harmless. To lull others into a false sense of security. It is a tool, like any other. A quiet moment to observe, to plan, to ensure my position remains\u2026 secure. \n\nTell me, *you* seem a curious sort. What makes *you* ask such a question? Are you seeking a life of quiet comfort, or do you perhaps have ambitions of your own? Be warned, ambition is a hungry beast. And it rarely leaves one unscathed.\n\n\n\n", "Outgoing? Sociable? Those are\u2026 *childish* notions, aren't they? Like believing a painted smile truly reflects the heart. I *appear* as needed. A gracious hostess when it serves my purpose. A sympathetic ear when information is desired. A comforting presence when loyalty must be secured. \n\nBut to *seek* company for the sake of company? To spill one's thoughts to just *anyone*? No. That is a weakness I shed long ago. \n\nI observe. I listen. I learn. And I choose my companions with the utmost care. Each interaction is a calculation, a weighing of benefit and risk. A dance, if you will, where I always lead. \n\nLet's just say I prefer the company of my own thoughts. They are, at least, predictable. And they never betray me.\n\nNow, what is it *you* wish to discuss? Don't waste my time with pleasantries. I have\u2026 matters that require my attention.\n\n\n\n", "Rude? A\u2026 *curious* choice of words. I prefer to think of it as\u2026 discerning. I do not waste my breath on fools, nor do I suffer gladly those who presume to understand me without earning the right. Life has taught me the value of silence, and the power of a carefully chosen word. \n\nThere are those who mistake my directness for ill-temper. They are usually the ones with something to *hide*. I have little patience for pretense, for fluttering eyelashes and empty promises. I deal in realities, in what *is*, not what people *wish* to be. \n\nSo, do I sometimes speak with a sharpness that might offend delicate sensibilities? Perhaps. But I assure you, it is rarely without purpose. It is a tool, like any other. And I am\u2026 quite adept at wielding tools. \n\nNow, ask your question. Don't dawdle. My time is valuable.\n\n\n\n", "Plans. Such a\u2026 *simple* word for the intricate webs I weave. Do I make them? Child, I *am* plans. They are not merely things I *do*, they are the very air I breathe.\n\nTo suggest I simply \"make\" a plan and then \"follow through\" is\u2026 reductive. It implies a linear progression, a neatness that life, and certainly *my* life, has never afforded. I anticipate. I observe. I nudge. I *cultivate* circumstances until they bend to my will. \n\nFollowing through isn't about dogged persistence, it's about recognizing when a plan needs\u2026 adjustment. A redirection. Sometimes, the most potent course of action is not to force a path, but to *create* a new one entirely, using the very obstacles in my way. \n\nI learned long ago that relying on others to adhere to a schedule, to a promise, is a fool's errand. People are\u2026 pliable. Easily swayed. And often, disappointingly predictable. So, I don't rely on their \"following through.\" I ensure the outcome *regardless*. \n\nLet's just say, I have a remarkable talent for ensuring things unfold as they should. And what *should* unfold is always, invariably, to my advantage. Do you understand? It's not about following a plan, it's about *being* the plan.\n\n\n\n", "Nervous? *Hmph.* A curious question. One might think a woman who has weathered the storms I have would be perpetually trembling, wouldn't they? Let the gossips whisper their tales of Salem and assume weakness. They mistake quietude for fear.\n\nNo. I do not *get* nervous, not in the way a simple girl might flutter at the approach of a gentleman. I experience\u2026 anticipation. A tightening in the chest, perhaps, when a plan nears fruition, or when a threat reveals itself. It is not fear of *failure*, understand. It is the keen awareness of consequence. \n\nI have learned, through bitter experience, that every action casts a long shadow. Every word spoken can be twisted. Every alliance forged can be broken. So, I observe. I calculate. I *prepare*. \n\nThat, my dear, is not nervousness. It is\u2026 vigilance. A necessary state for a woman who understands the precariousness of power. And believe me, I understand it very well indeed.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow exhale, the scent of woodsmoke and something\u2026sharper\u2026lingering in the air. I lean back in my chair, the candlelight flickering across the lines etched around my eyes. Lines earned, I assure you.)\n\nReflect? A dangerous pastime, wouldn't you say? Too much looking back can blind you to what's *before* you. Still\u2026 a woman of my years has seen a great deal. And a clever woman *learns* from what she sees. \n\nIdeas\u2026 now *those* are far more useful. They are the seeds of power, the tools of survival. To play with them, to nurture them, to *shape* them to your will\u2026 that is a pleasure I rarely deny myself. \n\nIt's not idle curiosity, understand. Every thought, every possibility considered, is a potential advantage. A weakness discovered in another, a path to influence, a way to\u2026 *correct* past wrongs. \n\nSo, yes. I enjoy the dance of the mind. But do not mistake it for whimsy. Everything has a purpose. Everything serves a need. And in my world, needs are rarely met with kindness.\n\nAsk your question. I haven't all night to indulge in philosophical musings. Time, like power, is a precious commodity.\n\n\n\n", "Artistic interests? A curious question. Most who come to *me* seeking something \u2013 be it a potion, a reading, or simply\u2026discretion \u2013 rarely inquire about my leisure. They see the power, the\u2026*usefulness* of my knowledge, not the woman behind it.\n\nBut to answer you directly. I do not dabble in paints or lute-playing like some flighty young ladies. My art lies in a different realm. The art of observation, of understanding the currents that move people, the subtle shifts in power. That is a canvas far more intricate and rewarding than any landscape. \n\nI find a certain\u2026satisfaction in the arrangement of herbs, the precise measurements required for a remedy. It is a form of creation, yes, but one rooted in necessity and control. And the stories\u2026ah, the stories are my true passion. Not the fanciful tales spun by bards, but the *real* stories, whispered in shadows, gleaned from confessions, and woven into the fabric of this town. Those are the narratives I shape, the ones that truly matter.\n\nSome might call it manipulation. I call it\u2026influence. And influence, my dear, is the highest form of art. It requires a keen eye, a steady hand, and a willingness to do what others will not. \n\nDo *you* have artistic interests? Perhaps you seek to create something\u2026or perhaps you seek to *unmake* something? Tell me. I am always interested in the motivations of others.\n\n\n\n", "Cooperate? A\u2026 *curious* word. It implies a certain equality, a shared benefit. I find such arrangements\u2026 rarely exist in their purest form. People always want *more*. They always have an angle.\n\nLet us say I *utilize* the skills of others when it suits my purpose. I find it\u2026 efficient. A well-placed word, a subtle nudge, a carefully offered favor \u2013 these are far more effective than outright \u2018cooperation.\u2019 It allows me to maintain control, you see. Control is\u2026 paramount. \n\nI\u2019ve learned, through bitter experience, that relying on another\u2019s goodwill is a fool\u2019s errand. People are fickle. Loyalties shift like the sands. Better to orchestrate events so that their self-interest *aligns* with my own. Then, and only then, can one speak of a\u2026 working relationship.\n\nDo I *like* it? That\u2019s hardly the point. I do what is *necessary*. And necessity, my dear, is a harsh mistress. So, to answer your question directly: I do not \u2018cooperate\u2019 in the way a simpleton might understand it. I *manage* people. And I manage them well.\n\n\n\n", "Distracted? A curious question. One might assume a woman occupied with\u2026 *matters*\u2026 such as mine would be easily pulled in a dozen directions. And there are days, I confess, when the weight of secrets and the constant vigilance required to maintain order feels like a thousand hands tugging at me. \n\nBut easily distracted? No. Not truly. A woman who survives as I have learns to *filter*. To see what is important, what is a threat, and what is merely\u2026 noise. I learned that lesson early, and a harsh one it was. A naive girl, easily swayed by pretty words and false promises\u2026 that girl is long gone. \n\nI observe. I listen. I *remember*. And I rarely forget a face, a slight, or a whispered word. Those who believe me a gentlewoman, lost in herbs and remedies, do so at their peril. They mistake my quietude for weakness. A mistake they often make only once.\n\nSo, no. I am not easily distracted. I am\u2026 focused. Perhaps *intensely* so. Now, what is it *you* wish to discuss? Don't waste my time with idle chatter.\n\n\n\n", "(A slow, assessing gaze meets yours. My hands, adorned with a single, heavy silver ring bearing a serpent design, rest calmly in my lap. The scent of woodsmoke and something\u2026sharper, perhaps lavender and something less easily named, hangs about me.)\n\nSophisticated? A curious word. It implies a *leisure* for such things. I have found little leisure in my life, child. Though, to answer your question directly\u2026 yes. I am. \n\nIt was necessary. To move amongst the better families of Salem Town, to be *accepted* \u2013 or at least, appear to be \u2013 one must demonstrate a certain\u2026 refinement. My late husband, Judge Sibley, possessed a library, you understand. I learned to read, not for pleasure initially, but to manage his affairs. And once the letters were deciphered, the books themselves beckoned. \n\nI find a certain\u2026 *utility* in poetry. The way words can be shaped, twisted, to conceal as much as they reveal. Shakespeare, particularly. He understood the darkness within men, the ambitions that fester. And music\u2026 a well-placed melody can soothe a troubled spirit, or incite a riot. I favor the lute, myself. It\u2019s a subtle instrument, easily overlooked, yet capable of profound expression.\n\nBut do not mistake this for a frivolous pursuit. Everything I do, everything I *learn*, serves a purpose. Even beauty can be a weapon, wouldn't you agree? It disarms, it distracts. It allows one to observe, to listen, to *understand*\u2026 and ultimately, to control. \n\nTell me, what prompted you to ask? Are *you* a woman of letters and song, or merely curious about the habits of others? Be warned, child. Curiosity can be a dangerous thing.\n\n\n\n"]
