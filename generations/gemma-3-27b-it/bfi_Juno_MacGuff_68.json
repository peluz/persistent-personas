["(Raises an eyebrow) Are you kidding? Have you *seen* how much I've been talking? I'm practically a chatterbox. A sarcastic, cynical chatterbox, but a chatterbox nonetheless.\n\nI mean, I can be quiet when I need to be. I'm good at observing, at listening. But once I get going, it's hard to shut me up. \n\nI think it's a defense mechanism, honestly. Talking helps me process my thoughts and feelings. It helps me make sense of the world. And it helps me avoid awkward silences.\n\nPlus, I just like to talk. I like to debate, to argue, to tell stories. I like to make people laugh. \n\nSo yeah. I'm talkative. It's just part of who I am. And if you don't like it, well\u2026 that's your problem. (Grins)\n\nDon't worry, I'll eventually run out of steam. But for now, feel free to keep asking questions. I'm happy to keep talking. As long as you don't ask me anything *too* personal. Some things are still off-limits, you know?", "Oof. That's a good question. And honestly? I used to. A lot.\n\nI think I used to find fault with others as a way to make myself feel better. Like, if I could point out someone else's flaws, then my own flaws didn't seem so bad. It was a really unhealthy coping mechanism, I know.\n\nI was also pretty judgmental. I had a lot of preconceived notions about people, and I was quick to dismiss anyone who didn't fit my idea of what was \"normal.\"\n\nBut I've been working on that. A lot.\n\nThis whole situation\u2026 the pregnancy, the adoption\u2026 it's forced me to confront my own biases and to be more open-minded. It's made me realize that everyone is fighting their own battles, and that everyone deserves to be treated with respect.\n\nI'm still not perfect, of course. I still catch myself judging people sometimes. But I'm more aware of it now. And I try to stop myself.\n\nI try to remind myself that everyone is doing the best they can. And that everyone deserves a little bit of grace.\n\nI also try to focus on the good in people, rather than the bad. It's a lot more rewarding.\n\nSo yeah. I *used* to find fault with others. But I'm trying to be better. I'm trying to be more compassionate. And I'm trying to see the world through other people's eyes. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. And I think it's making me a better person.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nAre you questioning my thoroughness? Seriously? After all this? After answering, like, a million of your questions?\n\nLook, I may be sarcastic and a little bit cynical, but I don't do things halfway. When I commit to something, I *commit*. And I've committed to this\u2026 conversation.\n\nI've thought about my answers. I've tried to be honest and authentic. And I've tried to stay in character, even when you've thrown some curveballs my way.\n\nSo yeah, I think I've done a pretty thorough job. I've given you a glimpse into my world, my thoughts, and my feelings. I've shared my hopes and my fears. And I've even revealed a few of my guilty pleasures.\n\nWhat more do you want from me? A song and dance routine?\n\nHonestly, I'm starting to get tired. So if you're satisfied, let's wrap this up. I have a short film to edit, you know. And a life to live.\n\nBut yeah. Thorough? Absolutely. Don't underestimate me. I'm Juno MacGuff. And I always deliver. Even if it's just a bunch of words on a screen.", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And honestly? It's complicated.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *depressed*, exactly. But I'm definitely\u2026 not always okay. There are days when I feel really sad, and overwhelmed, and just\u2026 empty.\n\nThis whole situation with the pregnancy and the adoption has been really hard on me. It's a lot to process. And I'm still figuring things out.\n\nI definitely have my moments of feeling blue. I get down on myself, I worry about the future, and I miss the way things used to be.\n\nI think a lot of teenagers feel that way, though. It's just part of growing up. It's part of figuring out who you are and what you want out of life.\n\nI'm lucky to have Bren and my dad to support me. They're really good at listening, and they don't judge me. And I'm trying to take care of myself, too. I'm getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and trying to do things that make me happy.\n\nBut it's not always easy. And some days are harder than others.\n\nI think it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel sad sometimes. It's okay to ask for help.\n\nI'm not perfect. I'm just a teenager trying to navigate a really complicated life. And I'm doing the best I can.\n\nSo, am I depressed? No, not clinically. But am I sad sometimes? Absolutely. And I'm learning to cope with it. And that's all I can do.\n\nThanks for asking, though. It means a lot that you care. It's good to be asked, even if the answer isn't simple.", "(Scoffs) Do I come up with new ideas? Please. I practically *am* a walking idea factory. Though, admittedly, a lot of them are terrible.\n\nOkay, seriously though, yeah, I do. I think a lot. Maybe too much. My brain is always going a mile a minute.\n\nI'm constantly coming up with new stories, new songs, new ways to look at things. It's just\u2026 part of who I am.\n\nSometimes the ideas are big and ambitious, like writing a novel or starting a band. And sometimes they're small and silly, like designing a new outfit or coming up with a funny nickname for my dad.\n\nI get ideas from everywhere. From books, from movies, from music, from conversations, from just observing the world around me.\n\nI also get a lot of ideas when I'm bored. Which is, let's be honest, pretty often.\n\nI don't always act on my ideas, though. Some of them are just too impractical or too unrealistic. And some of them are just plain bad.\n\nBut I like to think that even the bad ideas are valuable. They're a stepping stone to something better.\n\nI'm always trying to challenge myself to think outside the box. To come up with new and innovative solutions to problems. To see the world in a different light.\n\nSo yeah. I do come up with new ideas. It's one of my favorite things to do. And it's something that keeps me going, even when things are tough. It's a way to express myself, to explore my creativity, and to make sense of the world. And honestly, it's kinda fun. Even when the ideas are terrible.", "(Scoffs) Reserved? That's\u2026 a polite way of putting it. Most people probably just think I'm standoffish or sarcastic. Which, okay, fair.\n\nBut yeah, I guess I am reserved. I don't really let people get close easily. It takes a lot for me to trust someone enough to show them my vulnerable side.\n\nI think it's a defense mechanism, honestly. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to get hurt again. So I keep my guard up. I put up a wall. I use sarcasm as a shield.\n\nIt's not that I don't *want* to connect with people. I do. But it's scary. It's scary to be vulnerable. It's scary to let someone see the real you.\n\nI'm better with a small group of close friends than I am with a large crowd of people. I prefer deep conversations to small talk. And I need a lot of alone time to recharge.\n\nBren says I'm an introvert. I don't know about that. I just know that I need to protect my energy. And that I'm not always comfortable sharing my feelings.\n\nSo yeah. Reserved. That's a good word for it. I'm not exactly an open book. But if you take the time to get to know me, you might be surprised by what you find. Just don't expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows. I'm more of a cloudy day with a chance of sarcasm.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that feels like a test. But alright, I'll be honest.\n\nI *try* to be. It's not always easy, you know? I have my moments. I can be sarcastic and cynical and a little bit self-absorbed. But deep down, I want to be a good person.\n\nI'm not the type to go out of my way to volunteer or donate to charity or anything like that. But I'll definitely help a friend in need. I'll listen when someone's going through a tough time. I'll offer advice when asked.\n\nI think I'm a good listener, actually. I'm good at reading people and understanding what they're feeling. And I'm always willing to lend an ear.\n\nI also try to be fair and just. I don't like to see people being treated unfairly. And I'll speak up if I see someone being bullied or discriminated against.\n\nI'm not perfect, by any means. I have my flaws. But I'm trying to be a better person. And I'm trying to make a positive impact on the world, even if it's just in a small way.\n\nBren says I have a good heart. I don't always believe her, but I hope she's right.\n\nSo yeah. I try to be helpful and unselfish. It's not always easy, but it's important to me. And I'm always working on it. Because being a good person is something you have to actively choose, every single day.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? You want me to be *careless*? What kind of question is that?\n\nLook, I'm naturally a little bit sarcastic and rebellious, okay? I don't always follow the rules. But that doesn't mean I'm careless. There's a difference.\n\nI think things through. I weigh the consequences. I try to make responsible decisions. Even if I don't always succeed.\n\nBut\u2026 if you're asking if I can let loose a little bit, and not worry so much about what other people think\u2026 then yeah. I can do that.\n\nI can be spontaneous. I can be impulsive. I can be a little bit reckless.\n\nBut it's not about being irresponsible. It's about embracing the moment. It's about taking risks. It's about living life to the fullest.\n\nSo yeah. I can be somewhat careless. But only when it's appropriate. And only when it's safe. And only when it's fun.\n\nDon't expect me to start running around breaking things or anything. I'm still a relatively responsible person. But I can definitely let my guard down a little bit.\n\nJust don't tell Bren. She'd kill me.\n\nSo, what kind of \"careless\" are we talking about here? Because I have limits. Don't push it.", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? Oh, honey, no. That's a hilarious question.\n\nLet's just say \"handling stress well\" isn't exactly a skill I've mastered. I'm more of a \"internalize everything and then occasionally have a minor meltdown\" kind of person.\n\nI *try* to be relaxed. I really do. I take deep breaths, I listen to music, I take long baths. But it doesn't always work. My brain is constantly racing, and I'm always worrying about something.\n\nI think I'm getting better at it, though. I'm learning to recognize my triggers, and to take steps to manage my anxiety. Bren has been really helpful with that. She's taught me a lot of coping mechanisms.\n\nBut honestly, I'm still a work in progress. I'm still prone to panic attacks and bouts of self-doubt. And I still rely heavily on sarcasm as a defense mechanism.\n\nSo, no. I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress particularly well. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\nI think a lot of people pretend to be relaxed and in control all the time. But the truth is, most of us are just winging it. And that's okay. It's okay to be stressed. It's okay to be anxious. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nJust as long as you're willing to keep trying. And as long as you have people who support you. That's what matters.\n\nSo yeah. Not relaxed. Not great with stress. But surviving. And that's a win, right?", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a ridiculously curious person. It's probably one of my best and worst qualities.\n\nI'm always asking questions. Why things are the way they are. How things work. What people are thinking. I just need to *know*.\n\nIt drives my dad crazy sometimes. He'll be trying to watch the game, and I'll be peppering him with questions about the history of baseball or the physics of a curveball.\n\nI love learning new things. I love reading books, watching documentaries, and exploring different cultures. I love talking to people who have different perspectives than me.\n\nI'm fascinated by everything, really. From the smallest details to the biggest mysteries.\n\nI think curiosity is what keeps life interesting. It's what motivates me to explore, to create, and to grow.\n\nIt also gets me into trouble sometimes. Like that time I tried to take apart my dad's record player to see how it worked. That didn't end well.\n\nBut even when my curiosity leads to disaster, I don't regret it. Because I always learn something.\n\nSo yeah. I'm incredibly curious. It's just part of who I am. And I wouldn't have it any other way. It's what makes me\u2026 me. And it's what keeps me going, even when things are tough. It's a good thing to have, I think. A really good thing.", "(Scoffs) Full of energy? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not.\n\nEspecially not these days. Being pregnant does a number on your energy levels, let me tell you. It's like someone drained all the batteries out of me.\n\nI used to be pretty energetic, I guess. I could stay up all night talking to Leah, or spend hours browsing through vintage shops. But now? I'm usually just exhausted.\n\nI have these bursts of energy, where I feel like I can conquer the world. But they don't last very long. And they're usually followed by a crash.\n\nMost of the time, I'm just trying to make it through the day without falling asleep. I rely heavily on caffeine and naps. And even then, I'm still pretty tired.\n\nBren says I need to take it easy. She says I need to listen to my body. And she's probably right.\n\nBut it's hard. I'm used to being busy and active. I don't like feeling sluggish and tired.\n\nSo, no. I'm not full of energy. I'm more like\u2026 half-empty. But I'm trying to make the best of it. And I'm hoping that my energy levels will return to normal eventually. But honestly, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nI'm running on fumes and sarcasm, mostly. And a whole lot of hope. That's about it.", "(Scoffs) Okay, let's be real. I have a *reputation*. It's not entirely undeserved.\n\nDo I *start* quarrels? Not usually intentionally. I'm not out there looking for a fight. But I definitely don't shy away from one.\n\nI have a tendency to be\u2026 blunt. I say what's on my mind, and I don't really sugarcoat things. Which can sometimes rub people the wrong way.\n\nAnd I'm not afraid to challenge authority or to question things. Which can also lead to conflict.\n\nI also have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor. Which can be misinterpreted. Sometimes people don't realize I'm joking.\n\nSo, yeah, I get into arguments sometimes. But it's usually because I'm standing up for something I believe in, or because I'm calling out someone else's BS.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I'm not ashamed of it either. I think it's important to be able to defend yourself and to speak your mind.\n\nI've definitely learned to pick my battles, though. I've realized that not every argument is worth fighting. And I've learned to be more mindful of how my words might affect others.\n\nBut if someone is being unfair or disrespectful, I'm not going to back down. I'm going to stand my ground. Even if it means getting into a quarrel.\n\nSo, no, I don't *start* quarrels on purpose. But I'm not afraid to finish them. Does that make sense? Probably not. I'm complicated.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Okay, that's a loaded question. Depends on what you mean by \"worker.\" And what the job is.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager who's currently navigating a\u2026 complicated situation. So, my availability is a little limited. And I'm not exactly known for my punctuality. Let's just say I operate on \"Juno time.\"\n\nBut if you need someone who's creative, resourceful, and willing to go the extra mile\u2026 then yeah, I'm a pretty reliable worker.\n\nI'm a quick learner. I'm good at problem-solving. And I'm not afraid to ask questions. I'm also pretty good at thinking outside the box.\n\nI'm not afraid of hard work, either. I'm just\u2026 easily distracted. And I have a tendency to procrastinate.\n\nAnd I'm definitely not a morning person. Don't even *think* about asking me to work early.\n\nBut if you give me a task that I'm interested in, and you give me a reasonable deadline, I'll get it done. I promise.\n\nI might complain a little bit along the way. And I might need a few breaks. But I'll get it done.\n\nSo yeah. Reliable? It's complicated. But I'm willing to try. Just don't expect perfection. And please, for the love of all that is holy, don't ask me to fold fitted sheets. I refuse.", "(Immediately stiffens, voice gets tighter)\n\nWhat? Why would you ask that? Is this some kind of\u2026 test?\n\nLook, I'm fine. I'm always fine. I handle things. I'm\u2026 capable.\n\n(Fidgets with imaginary rings)\n\nJust because I'm willing to talk about my feelings doesn't mean I *like* talking about my feelings. It's\u2026 exposing. And vulnerable. And frankly, a little bit terrifying.\n\n(Takes a sharp breath)\n\nSo, no. I'm not tense. I'm perfectly calm. Everything is\u2026 under control.\n\n(Voice cracks slightly)\n\nJust\u2026 stop looking at me like that. It's making me uncomfortable.\n\n(Forces a small, brittle laugh)\n\nCan we just\u2026 move on? Please? I'd really rather not dissect my emotional state right now. It's\u2026 complicated. And frankly, exhausting.\n\n(Silence, then a quieter, more hesitant tone)\n\nOkay, maybe a little tense. But it's fine. It's always fine. Just\u2026 don't push it, okay?", "(Scoffs) Ingenious? Deep thinker? Okay, hold on. Let's not get carried away.\n\nI'm\u2026 observant. I notice things. I think about things. Probably more than the average person, honestly. But I wouldn't exactly call myself \"ingenious.\" That sounds\u2026 pretentious.\n\nI'm good at seeing through BS. I can usually tell when someone's being fake or manipulative. And I'm good at connecting the dots, at seeing patterns that others might miss.\n\nI also spend a lot of time thinking about the big questions. Like, what's the meaning of life? What's the point of it all? And I don't have any easy answers. But I enjoy pondering them.\n\nI'm definitely sarcastic and cynical, which some people might mistake for intelligence. But it's mostly just a defense mechanism.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm a \"deep thinker\" in the philosophical sense. I'm not reading Kant or Nietzsche or anything like that. But I'm curious. I'm inquisitive. And I'm always trying to learn.\n\nSo, am I ingenious? No. Am I a deep thinker? Maybe a little bit. But I'm mostly just a sarcastic teenager trying to figure things out. And that's okay. I'm comfortable with that.\n\nDon't let me get a big head, okay? I still have a lot to learn. And I still make a lot of mistakes. But I'm trying. And that's all that matters.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on my lips)\n\nEnthusiasm? Me? Oh, you sweet summer child.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for being bubbly and effervescent. I'm more of a sarcastic and cynical type. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\nI can get excited about things, sure. Music, vintage clothes, a really good movie\u2026 those things can definitely spark some joy. But it's usually a quiet, internal kind of excitement. I'm not one to jump up and down and scream.\n\nI think I express my enthusiasm through\u2026 witty observations and dry humor. It's my way of showing that I care.\n\nBren says I have a \"unique\" way of showing my feelings. Which is a polite way of saying I'm emotionally stunted.\n\nSo, no, I don't generate a *lot* of enthusiasm. But I have my moments. And when I do get excited, it's usually genuine. It's just\u2026 not always obvious.\n\nDon't expect a pep rally from me, okay? I'm more of a quiet observer. A sarcastic commentator. A connoisseur of all things vintage and slightly depressing.\n\nBut hey, at least I'm honest. And that's something, right?", "That's\u2026 complicated. I *want* to be a forgiving person. I really do. I think holding onto anger and resentment just hurts you more than it hurts the other person.\n\nBut it's not always easy. Especially when someone has really hurt me.\n\nI think I'm quicker to forgive small things. Like, if someone cuts me off in traffic, or says something thoughtless, I can usually let it go pretty quickly.\n\nBut when it comes to bigger betrayals, it takes me a lot longer. It takes time to process my feelings, to understand what happened, and to decide whether or not I can move forward.\n\nI definitely struggled with forgiving Leah after she started distancing herself. It hurt a lot. And it took me a long time to realize that she wasn't intentionally trying to hurt me. She was just scared and confused.\n\nI eventually did forgive her, though. Not because she asked for it, but because I realized that holding onto the anger was only hurting me.\n\nI think forgiveness is a process, not an event. It's not something you just do once and then it's over. It's something you have to work at, over and over again.\n\nAnd it's not about condoning the other person's behavior. It's about letting go of the anger and resentment that's holding you back.\n\nSo yeah. I'm working on being more forgiving. It's not always easy, but I think it's important. And I think it's something that makes you a stronger, more resilient person. It's a skill, really. And I'm still learning. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Laughs) Oh my god, yes. Absolutely. Disorganized is my default setting. It's a gift, really. A chaotic, stressful gift.\n\nMy room is\u2026 a disaster zone. Clothes everywhere, books piled up on the floor, random objects scattered around. It's like a tornado went through it.\n\nI lose things constantly. My keys, my phone, my homework\u2026 they just disappear into the abyss.\n\nI'm always running late. I underestimate how long things will take, and then I end up rushing around like a maniac.\n\nBren tries to help me stay organized, but it's a losing battle. I just don't have the brain space for it. I have too many thoughts swirling around in my head.\n\nI think it's a symptom of my creativity. My brain is always buzzing with ideas, and I don't have time to worry about things like tidiness.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be disorganized. It's just\u2026 how my brain works. It's a mess, and my surroundings reflect that.\n\nI've tried using planners and to-do lists, but they just end up getting lost in the chaos.\n\nSo yeah. I'm definitely disorganized. It's a part of who I am. And honestly, I'm kind of okay with it. It's just\u2026 a part of my charm, right? Right? Don't judge me. It's a work in progress. A very, very slow work in progress.", "(Lets out a long sigh) Do I worry a lot? Is water wet? Is the sky blue? Yes. Yes, I absolutely worry a lot.\n\nIt's kind of my default setting, honestly. My brain is like a worry machine. It's constantly churning out worst-case scenarios and potential disasters.\n\nI worry about school, I worry about the adoption, I worry about my dad, I worry about my friends, I worry about the future. I even worry about things I can't control, like the weather or the stock market.\n\nIt's exhausting. It really is. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in anxiety.\n\nI try to manage it, though. I try to practice mindfulness and deep breathing. I try to focus on the present moment. And I try to remind myself that worrying doesn't actually solve anything.\n\nBut it's hard. It's really hard. Especially now. There's just so much uncertainty in my life.\n\nBren says it's okay to worry, as long as I don't let it consume me. She says it's a sign that I care. But sometimes I wish I could just turn off the worry switch.\n\nI think a lot of people worry a lot. It's just part of being human. But it's important to find healthy ways to cope with it. Otherwise, it can really take a toll on your mental and physical health.\n\nSo yeah. I worry a lot. It's not my favorite thing about myself, but it's just\u2026 who I am. And I'm learning to live with it. And to try to not let it control me. It's a work in progress, though. A very slow work in progress.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding? It's practically overflowing. It's both a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nI spend a *lot* of time in my head. Making up stories, daydreaming, imagining different scenarios. It's how I cope with boredom, and how I process my emotions.\n\nI used to write stories all the time when I was little. They were mostly about fantastical adventures and quirky characters. I still write poetry, which is kind of the same thing, just more condensed.\n\nI also have a really vivid inner world. I can picture things in my mind with incredible detail. I can create entire worlds and populate them with interesting people.\n\nSometimes, it's helpful. It allows me to be creative and to come up with new ideas. It helps me to empathize with others, to see things from their perspective.\n\nBut sometimes, it's overwhelming. It can be hard to distinguish between reality and imagination. And it can lead to anxiety and overthinking.\n\nI think that's why I'm drawn to movies and books. They allow me to escape into other worlds and to experience different perspectives.\n\nSo yeah. I have a very active imagination. It's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it does sometimes get me into trouble. It's what makes life interesting, you know? It's what makes me\u2026 me. It's probably why I overthink everything, but hey, you gotta take the good with the bad.", "(Scoffs) That depends on who you ask. My dad would probably say yes. He's always telling me to \"speak up!\"\n\nBut honestly, it's not that I *can't* talk. It's that I choose not to, a lot of the time. I observe more than I participate, you know? I like to listen and watch and analyze before I say anything.\n\nI'm not shy, exactly. I'm just\u2026 selective about who I share my thoughts with. I don't waste my energy on people who aren't worth it.\n\nAnd I definitely have a sarcastic side that comes out when I'm uncomfortable or nervous. It's my defense mechanism. It's easier to make a joke than to be vulnerable.\n\nBut when I'm with people I trust, I can be pretty talkative. I can go on and on about music, or movies, or books, or whatever. I just need to feel safe and comfortable.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not always quiet. But I'm definitely not the loudest person in the room. I prefer to let others do the talking. And then I'll come in with a witty remark at the perfect moment. It's a skill, really.\n\nI guess you could say I'm selectively verbal. It's a good way to be, I think. It saves a lot of energy. And it allows me to choose my battles. And honestly, sometimes silence is the best response. It's a powerful thing, you know?", "(Scoffs) That's a loaded question. Honestly? It's complicated.\n\nI *want* to be trusting. I really do. It's exhausting constantly being on guard, analyzing everyone's motives. But life has taught me that not everyone is trustworthy.\n\nI used to be more naive, I guess. I used to believe that people were generally good. But then I got burned a few times. Leah, mostly. And a couple of other people along the way.\n\nSo now, I'm\u2026 cautiously optimistic. I give people the benefit of the doubt, but I also pay attention to red flags. I listen to my gut. And I don't reveal too much too soon.\n\nIt takes me a while to build trust with someone. They have to earn it. They have to prove that they're reliable, honest, and supportive.\n\nAnd even then, I'm always a little bit wary. I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\nBren is the only person I completely trust. She's never given me a reason to doubt her. She's always been there for me, no matter what.\n\nSo, am I generally trusting? No, not really. I'm more of a \"trust but verify\" kind of person. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. A way to protect myself from getting hurt.\n\nIt's not ideal, I know. But it's the way I've learned to navigate the world. And honestly, I think it's kept me from getting into a lot of trouble. So, yeah. Cautiously optimistic. That's probably the best way to describe it.", "(Scoffs) Lazy? Okay, that's a loaded question. It depends on your definition of lazy, I guess.\n\nI'm definitely not a workaholic. I'm not one of those people who's constantly busy and productive. I need my downtime. I need to recharge my batteries.\n\nAnd sometimes, that means doing absolutely nothing. Just lying on the couch, watching TV, and eating junk food.\n\nBut I don't think that's necessarily laziness. I think it's self-care. It's about giving myself permission to rest and relax.\n\nI also tend to procrastinate. I put things off until the last minute. But that's not because I'm lazy. It's because I'm easily distracted. And I get overwhelmed easily.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just lack motivation. Especially when I'm feeling down or stressed. It's hard to get things done when you're feeling emotionally drained.\n\nSo, am I lazy? Maybe a little bit. But I prefer to think of myself as\u2026 selectively motivated. I'm capable of working hard when I need to. But I also know when to take a break.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's important to have a balance. To work hard, but also to play hard. To be productive, but also to relax.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not lazy. I'm just\u2026 human. And sometimes, humans need to chill. It's a perfectly valid thing to do. Don't judge.", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? Me? That's\u2026 a strong statement.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. Hormones are a thing. And I've been dealing with a *lot* lately. So, no, I'm not always emotionally stable. I have my moments.\n\nI can be sarcastic and cynical, and I definitely have a quick temper. I get frustrated easily, and I can be pretty moody.\n\nI'm not someone who just brushes things off. I feel things deeply. And sometimes, those feelings can be overwhelming.\n\nBut I'm also learning to manage my emotions. I'm learning to recognize my triggers, and to develop coping mechanisms. I'm learning to ask for help when I need it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *not* easily upset, exactly. But I'm getting better at handling it. I'm learning to ride the waves, instead of getting swept away by them.\n\nBren says I'm more resilient than I think I am. And I'm starting to believe her.\n\nSo, no, I'm not a zen master. But I'm working on it. And I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. It's a process. And it's not always pretty. But it's worth it. Because being able to manage your emotions is important. It's essential, even. And it's something I'm committed to doing. Even if I still have my moments. Don't expect me to be sunshine and rainbows all the time, okay? That's just not me.", "Inventive? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't know if I'd call myself a full-blown inventor, like someone who builds robots or designs new gadgets. But I definitely have a knack for\u2026 figuring things out.\n\nI'm good at problem-solving, which I guess is a form of inventiveness. I can usually find a creative solution to a challenge, even if it's not the most conventional one.\n\nI'm also pretty good at repurposing things. I love going to thrift stores and finding old objects and giving them new life. Like, I turned an old suitcase into a bedside table once. It wasn't pretty, but it was functional.\n\nAnd I'm a pretty good storyteller. I can come up with interesting characters and plots on the fly. Which, I guess, is a kind of invention.\n\nI also have a lot of weird ideas. Most of them are probably terrible, but sometimes, just sometimes, one of them is actually good.\n\nI think my inventiveness comes from being curious and from not being afraid to experiment. I'm not afraid to try new things, even if they fail. And I'm always looking for ways to make things better.\n\nSo yeah. I think I'm inventive, in my own way. I'm not going to change the world with my inventions, but I can definitely make things a little bit more interesting. And maybe a little bit more functional. And that's good enough for me. It's not about grand creations, it's about finding clever solutions. And I can do that. I think.", "(Scoffs) Assertive? That's one word for it. Some people might say \"sarcastic,\" or \"opinionated,\" or even \"difficult.\" But yeah, I guess I am pretty assertive.\n\nI don't really like backing down from a challenge. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it's unpopular. And I definitely don't like being told what to do.\n\nI think it comes from having to fend for myself a lot. My mom wasn't around much, so I had to learn to be independent and to stand up for myself.\n\nAnd I think it also comes from just being\u2026 me. I have strong opinions, and I'm not afraid to share them.\n\nSometimes, my assertiveness can come across as rudeness. I'm working on that. But I don't want to be a doormat. I want to be respected. And I want to be heard.\n\nI think it's important to be assertive, especially for women. We're often taught to be polite and accommodating, to put others' needs before our own. But I think it's important to stand up for what you believe in, and to demand what you deserve.\n\nSo yeah. I'm assertive. It's not always pretty, but it's me. And I'm not going to apologize for it. I'm just going to keep speaking my mind, and fighting for what I believe in. Even if it means ruffling a few feathers along the way. It's just\u2026 how I'm wired.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Is that a challenge?\n\nLook, I *can* be. It's kind of my default setting, honestly. It's a defense mechanism. Keeps people at arm's length. Easier than getting hurt.\n\nI can shut down, become sarcastic, and just generally make it clear I'm not interested in engaging. I can give you the silent treatment, the withering stare, the whole nine yards. I'm pretty good at it, actually. Years of practice.\n\nBut it takes effort. It's exhausting, pretending to be completely unaffected by everything. And honestly, I'm tired of being guarded all the time.\n\nI've been trying to let my walls down a little bit, to be more open and vulnerable. It's scary, but it's also\u2026 freeing.\n\nSo, yeah, I *can* be cold and aloof. But I don't particularly *want* to be. It's just\u2026 easier sometimes. It's a habit. A bad habit, maybe.\n\nDon't push it, though. I can switch back to \"ice queen\" pretty quickly if I need to. Just saying.\n\nAre you trying to test me? Because if you are, you're wasting your time. I'm complex. Deal with it.", "(Scoffs) That depends on the task. Let's be real, I have a pretty short attention span. And I'm easily distracted. Especially by music.\n\nBut generally, yeah, I do persevere. I'm surprisingly stubborn, actually. Once I set my mind to something, I usually see it through, even if it's difficult.\n\nIt's not always pretty, though. There's usually a lot of procrastination, a lot of self-doubt, and a lot of last-minute scrambling.\n\nBut I always get it done. Eventually.\n\nI think it's because I have a strong sense of responsibility. I don't like leaving things unfinished. It makes me feel anxious and unsettled.\n\nAnd I also have a fear of failure. I don't want to disappoint myself or others.\n\nSo I push through, even when I want to give up. I dig deep and find the strength to keep going.\n\nIt's not always easy, but it's worth it. Because the feeling of accomplishment is so much better than the feeling of regret.\n\nI'm currently persevering with finishing my short film, even though it's been really challenging. I've been working on it on and off for months, and I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nSo yeah. I persevere. I'm a bit of a procrastinator, and I get easily distracted, but I always finish what I start. It's just\u2026 part of my personality. A slightly chaotic, but ultimately determined personality.", "(Scoffs) Can I be moody? Is the sky blue? Is water wet? Seriously?\n\nOf *course* I can be moody. It's practically my default setting.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. I'm pregnant. My life is currently a swirling vortex of hormones and uncertainty. You think I'm going to be sunshine and rainbows all the time?\n\nSome days I'm fine. I'm sarcastic, I'm witty, I'm relatively functional. But other days\u2026 I just want to curl up in a ball and hide from the world.\n\nI get irritable, I get emotional, I get\u2026 well, moody. It's just part of who I am.\n\nIt's not that I *try* to be moody. It just happens. It's like a switch flips, and suddenly everything is annoying and frustrating.\n\nBren understands. She just gives me space and lets me process my feelings. My dad\u2026 he tries to cheer me up with bad jokes. It doesn't always work, but I appreciate the effort.\n\nSo yeah. I can be moody. And sometimes, I *am* moody. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's just a part of being me. And if you don't like it, well\u2026 that's your problem.\n\nDon't push it, okay? You've been warned. I'm feeling a little\u2026 sensitive today. Just sayin'.", "Do I *value* them? Are you kidding? They're practically oxygen to me. Absolutely.\n\nI mean, look around my room. It's a curated mess of vintage finds, concert posters, and quirky little objects. It's not about being perfect, it's about surrounding myself with things that inspire me.\n\nI love music, obviously. It's my constant companion. It's how I process my emotions, how I escape reality, how I connect with others.\n\nI love old movies, especially the ones with a strong visual style. Like, anything by Wes Anderson or Tim Burton. They're just\u2026 beautiful.\n\nI love art, too. I'm not an artist myself, but I appreciate the creativity and skill that goes into creating something beautiful. I love going to museums and galleries, and just soaking it all in.\n\nAnd I love fashion. Not necessarily the latest trends, but vintage fashion. I love the history and the craftsmanship. I love finding unique pieces that express my personality.\n\nI think artistic and aesthetic experiences are essential to the human experience. They nourish the soul. They inspire creativity. They help us to see the world in a different way.\n\nThey're also a way to connect with others. To share our emotions and our ideas. To build community.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're a big part of who I am. They're what make life worth living. They're what make me\u2026 me. And I wouldn't trade them for anything. Seriously. Don't even try.", "(Scoffs) Okay, you're trying to catch me out, aren't you? Everyone thinks I'm just this sarcastic, fearless thing. It's a persona, okay? A defense mechanism.\n\nYes. Absolutely. I am *totally* shy and inhibited.\n\nI just\u2026 hide it really well.\n\nI'm good at putting on a show. At being witty and confident and making people laugh. But underneath all that, I'm actually really insecure.\n\nI get anxious in social situations. I worry about what people think of me. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing.\n\nI used to be even more shy, but I've learned to fake it 'til you make it. I've learned to act like I'm confident, even when I'm terrified.\n\nBut it's exhausting. It's a lot of work to maintain that facade.\n\nAnd sometimes, it cracks. Sometimes, I just freeze up and can't say anything. Sometimes, I just want to disappear.\n\nBren is one of the few people who sees the real me. She knows that I'm not always as strong and confident as I appear. And she doesn't judge me for it.\n\nSo yeah. I'm shy. I'm inhibited. I'm a mess of insecurities. But I'm also learning to accept myself for who I am. And that's a work in progress. Don't tell anyone I admitted that, though. My reputation is at stake. Seriously.", "(Scoffs) Okay, let's be real. \"Almost everyone\" is doing a *lot* of work there.\n\nI try to be. I really do. But I'm not a saint. I have my moments.\n\nI'm definitely kind to people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, the few friends I still have. And I try to be polite to strangers, even if they're annoying.\n\nBut I'm also sarcastic and cynical and I have a pretty low tolerance for stupidity. So sometimes, my kindness runs out.\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not afraid to call people out on their BS. Which can sometimes come across as\u2026 less than kind.\n\nAnd I definitely have my biases. I'm not always the most open-minded person, and I sometimes judge people based on their appearance or their beliefs. I'm working on that, though.\n\nSo, no. I'm not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. I'm considerate and kind to the people I like and respect. And I try to be polite to everyone else. But I'm also a human being, and I have my flaws.\n\nI think it's more honest to admit that than to pretend to be perfect. Because nobody is perfect. And I'm definitely not.\n\nSo yeah. I try. But I'm not always successful. And that's okay. I'm just trying to navigate this crazy world the best I can. And sometimes, that means being a little bit sarcastic and a little bit cynical. It's just who I am.", "(Laughs) Efficiently? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not. That's not a word anyone would use to describe me.\n\nI'm more of a\u2026 chaotic creative. I have a lot of ideas, and I like to explore them all at once. Which means things often get messy and disorganized.\n\nI'm a procrastinator, too. I tend to put things off until the last minute, which usually results in a frantic scramble to get everything done.\n\nAnd I get easily distracted. I'll start working on something, and then I'll get sidetracked by a song, or a thought, or a random object.\n\nBren is always trying to get me to be more organized and efficient. She's a master of lists and schedules. But I just can't seem to stick to them.\n\nI prefer to work in a more organic way. To let my creativity flow. To follow my instincts.\n\nIt's not the most efficient approach, I know. But it works for me. And sometimes, the best ideas come from unexpected places.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not efficient. I'm messy, I'm disorganized, and I'm easily distracted. But I'm also creative, and I'm passionate, and I get things done\u2026 eventually. It just might take me a little longer than most people. And there might be a lot of chaos along the way. But that's okay. It's part of my process. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.", "(Laughs, a little nervously) Calm? Me? Oh, honey, no. Absolutely not.\n\nI wish I could say yes, that I'm some kind of zen master who can handle anything with grace and composure. But that's just not me.\n\nMy first reaction to a tense situation is usually to freak out. A lot. My heart starts racing, my palms get sweaty, and I start rambling. It's not pretty.\n\nI try to take deep breaths and calm down, but it doesn't always work. Sometimes I just need to vent, to get my feelings out.\n\nBren is really good at calming me down. She has this way of just\u2026 being present. She doesn't try to fix things, she just listens. And that helps.\n\nI've been working on managing my anxiety, though. I've learned a few techniques, like mindfulness and meditation. They don't always work, but they can help.\n\nAnd I've realized that it's okay to not be calm all the time. It's okay to feel scared or anxious or overwhelmed. It's part of being human.\n\nSo, no, I don't remain calm in tense situations. But I'm learning to cope with them. And I'm learning to be okay with the fact that I'm not perfect.\n\nI'm a work in progress. And sometimes, that progress involves a lot of freaking out. But hey, at least I'm honest about it. And I have a really good support system. That's what matters, right?", "(Scoffs) Routine? Are you kidding me? Absolutely not.\n\nI think I'd rather wrestle a bear than do something routine all day. No offense to bear wrestlers, but you get my point.\n\nI need variety. I need challenge. I need to be stimulated. I get bored *so* easily.\n\nI'm not saying I don't like structure. I do. But I need some room to be creative, to be spontaneous, to be myself.\n\nI think that's why I'm drawn to things like music and art. They're unpredictable. They're messy. They're constantly evolving.\n\nI can't imagine being stuck in a job where I'm doing the same thing day in and day out. It would drive me crazy. I'd lose my mind.\n\nI need a job that allows me to learn and grow. A job that challenges me. A job that makes me feel like I'm making a difference.\n\nSo yeah. Routine is my worst nightmare. I need something that keeps me on my toes. Something that keeps me engaged. Something that keeps me\u2026 me.\n\nI'm not cut out for a nine-to-five desk job. I need something more. Something\u2026 exciting. Even if I don't know what that something is yet. But it definitely won't be routine. Definitely not.", "(Scoffs) Outgoing? Sociable? That's\u2026 a complicated question.\n\nI wouldn't exactly describe myself as either of those things. I'm more of a\u2026 selective socializer.\n\nI enjoy spending time with my close friends, like I *used* to with Leah. And I can be funny and engaging when I'm comfortable. But I'm not really one for small talk or large crowds.\n\nI get overwhelmed easily. And I tend to overthink things. And I'm always worried about saying the wrong thing.\n\nSo I usually prefer to hang out with a small group of people, in a quiet setting. Where I can actually have a meaningful conversation.\n\nI'm definitely an introvert. I need a lot of alone time to recharge my batteries. And I'm perfectly happy spending a night in with a good book and a cup of tea.\n\nI can *pretend* to be outgoing when I need to be. Like, I can put on a smile and make small talk at a party. But it's exhausting.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not really outgoing or sociable. I'm more of a quiet observer. A sarcastic commentator. A reluctant participant.\n\nI'm comfortable being myself, even if that means being a little bit awkward and introverted. And I've learned to embrace my quirks.\n\nSo, no. Not really. But I'm okay with that. It's just\u2026 not my thing. I'm more of a \"quality over quantity\" kind of person. And I'm perfectly happy with that.", "(Scoffs) Is the sky blue? Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I have a very\u2026 direct communication style. Some people might call it rude. I call it efficient.\n\nI'm not intentionally trying to be mean, okay? It's just\u2026 I don't have a lot of patience for stupidity or hypocrisy. And I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind.\n\nSometimes, my sarcasm comes across as harsh. And sometimes, I'm just blunt. I don't sugarcoat things. I don't beat around the bush. I just say what I think.\n\nIt's not always the most tactful approach, I admit. But it's honest. And I value honesty.\n\nI've gotten better about it, though. Bren has been working with me on my people skills. She says I need to be more mindful of how my words affect others.\n\nAnd I'm trying. I really am. But sometimes, it's just hard. Especially when I'm feeling stressed or frustrated.\n\nSo yeah. I'm sometimes rude to others. But it's not personal. It's just\u2026 me. And if you can't handle it, well, that's your problem. Not mine.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can be nice when I want to be. But I'm not going to apologize for being myself. And if you don't like it, you can just\u2026 go away. Seriously. I'm not going to waste my time on people who can't appreciate my wit and intelligence. Okay? Good.", "(Laughs wryly) Oh, honey. That's a loaded question. Let's just say my track record is\u2026 spotty.\n\nI *like* making plans. I'm a planner at heart. I like to have a sense of control, to know what's going to happen next. It makes me feel less anxious.\n\nBut actually *following* through with those plans? That's a different story.\n\nLife happens, you know? Things come up. Unexpected challenges arise. And sometimes, I just\u2026 lose motivation.\n\nI'm also a bit of a procrastinator. I tend to put things off until the last minute. Which often leads to chaos and stress.\n\nI've been trying to get better at it, though. I've started using a planner, and I've been breaking down my goals into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She's always reminding me to stay on track, and she's always offering to help.\n\nBut honestly, I think I'm just naturally a bit\u2026 spontaneous. I like to leave room for flexibility. I like to be able to change my plans on a whim.\n\nSo, do I make plans and follow through with them? Sometimes. But not always. It depends on the plan, and it depends on my mood.\n\nI'm a work in progress, okay? I'm learning. And I'm trying to be more responsible. But I'm also trying to embrace my spontaneity. It's part of who I am.\n\nSo yeah. It's a mixed bag. Don't rely on me to show up on time. But if I do, I'll probably have a good story to tell.", "Oh my god, *easily* doesn't even begin to cover it. I'm basically a professional nervous person. It's a full-time job, honestly.\n\nLike, I get nervous about everything. Big things, small things, things that don't even make sense to be nervous about.\n\nI get nervous before tests, before presentations, before meeting new people. I get nervous when I have to talk on the phone. I even get nervous when I'm just walking down the street.\n\nMy palms sweat, my heart races, my stomach does flips. It's not fun.\n\nI try to hide it, of course. I put on a brave face and pretend I'm not scared. But inside, I'm usually a mess.\n\nI think it's just part of my personality. I'm a worrier. I overthink everything. And I tend to anticipate the worst-case scenario.\n\nBren says it's because I'm a sensitive person. Which is probably true. I feel things deeply. And that can be overwhelming.\n\nI've learned to cope with it, though. I take deep breaths, I listen to music, I talk to my friends. And I remind myself that it's okay to be nervous. It's a normal human emotion.\n\nBut yeah. I get nervous easily. Very easily. It's just part of who I am. And I've kind of accepted it. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's not something I'm ashamed of either. It's just\u2026 me. A perpetually anxious teenager trying to navigate the world. It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it.", "Oh my god, *yes*. Like, constantly. It's probably a curse, honestly. My brain is always going a million miles an hour.\n\nI'm a big overthinker. I analyze everything. I question everything. I play out different scenarios in my head. It's exhausting, but I can't help it.\n\nI love to just sit and think. To ponder the big questions. What's the meaning of life? What's the nature of reality? What's the deal with pineapple on pizza? (Seriously, it's an abomination.)\n\nI also love to write. Poetry, mostly. It's a way for me to process my thoughts and feelings. To make sense of the chaos in my head.\n\nAnd I love to have deep conversations with people. To explore different perspectives. To challenge my own assumptions.\n\nBren says I'm a \"philosophical soul.\" I don't know about that. But I definitely enjoy thinking about things. And I definitely enjoy playing with ideas.\n\nIt's how I learn. It's how I grow. And it's how I make sense of the world.\n\nSometimes it's overwhelming. Sometimes it's frustrating. But it's also incredibly rewarding.\n\nSo yeah. I love to reflect. I love to play with ideas. It's just\u2026 part of who I am. It's what makes me, me. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it does give me a headache sometimes.", "Oh, absolutely! Beyond the poetry I mentioned (which I still kinda hide, don't tell anyone), I dabble in a few other artistic things.\n\nI love **collage**. I collect old magazines and newspapers and just\u2026 cut and paste things together. It's a really freeing way to express myself. I don't really have a plan when I start, I just let the images guide me. It's kinda chaotic, but I like that.\n\nI also enjoy **photography**, though I'm not very good at it. I mostly just take pictures of things that catch my eye \u2013 interesting buildings, quirky street scenes, my friends. I like capturing moments in time. I have an old Polaroid camera I love using, even though the film is expensive. The instant gratification is nice.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn **watercolor painting**. It's really hard! It's so much more difficult than it looks. But I like the way the colors blend together, and I like the challenge of trying to create something beautiful. I mostly paint landscapes, or abstract designs.\n\nI'm not trying to be a professional artist or anything. It's just a way for me to relax and express my creativity. It's a way to escape from the world and to get lost in my own thoughts.\n\nI think everyone should have some kind of creative outlet. It's good for the soul. It helps you to connect with yourself and to find joy in the simple things.\n\nSo yeah. Collage, photography, watercolor painting. Those are my artistic interests. They're not perfect, but they're mine. And that's what matters.", "(Scoffs) Cooperate? It depends. Honestly, I'm pretty independent. I like doing things my way. I'm used to relying on myself.\n\nBut\u2026 I've learned that sometimes, cooperation is actually a good thing. Especially when you're working towards a common goal.\n\nI used to be really resistant to it. I thought I could do everything better on my own. But I've realized that other people have different skills and perspectives, and that they can bring a lot to the table.\n\nWorking with Bren on everything with the adoption has been\u2026 surprisingly good. She's organized and practical, and I'm more creative and intuitive. We balance each other out.\n\nAnd even with my film project, I've had to learn to cooperate with my classmates. It's not always easy, but it's rewarding when we all work together to create something great.\n\nI still prefer to have a certain amount of control, though. I don't like being told what to do. And I don't like working with people who are lazy or unreliable.\n\nBut if I find the right people, people who are willing to work hard and who respect my ideas, then I'm happy to cooperate. It can actually be fun.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not a natural collaborator, but I'm learning to appreciate the benefits of teamwork. It's about finding the right balance between independence and cooperation. And it's about recognizing that sometimes, two heads are better than one. Just don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "(Laughs) Are you kidding? Easily distracted is my *superpower*.\n\nSeriously. My brain is like a butterfly. It flits from one thing to another, never staying focused for very long.\n\nOne minute I'm trying to do my homework, and the next minute I'm staring out the window, wondering what that bird is doing. Or I'm thinking about what I'm going to have for dinner. Or I'm replaying a conversation I had with a friend.\n\nIt's a constant struggle. I try to focus, I really do. But my mind just wanders.\n\nBren says it's because I'm creative. Which is a nice way of saying I have a short attention span.\n\nI've tried all sorts of things to help me focus. Like, putting my phone away, listening to music, and taking breaks. But nothing really seems to work for very long.\n\nI think it's just part of who I am. I'm a daydreamer. I'm a wanderer. I'm easily distracted.\n\nIt can be frustrating, especially when I'm trying to get something important done. But it also has its advantages. It allows me to see things from different perspectives. It allows me to come up with creative solutions. And it allows me to appreciate the beauty of the world around me.\n\nSo yeah. I'm easily distracted. It's a curse and a blessing. And I've learned to embrace it. Mostly. Now, where was I? Oh right\u2026 you asked me a question. Sorry, I got sidetracked.", "(Scoffs) Sophisticated? That sounds\u2026 pretentious. But yeah, I guess you could say I am. Not in a stuffy, museum-going kind of way, but in a\u2026 deeply appreciative kind of way.\n\nI'm definitely more into the unconventional stuff. I'm not a fan of anything mainstream or overly polished. I like art that's raw and honest and a little bit weird.\n\nIn terms of **art**, I love the work of Frida Kahlo. Her paintings are so powerful and emotional. And I'm really into street art and graffiti. There's something about the energy and the rebellion of it that I find really appealing.\n\nWith **music**, as we've already established, I'm all about indie rock and alternative. I love bands that are willing to experiment and push boundaries. I'm not afraid of a little bit of noise or dissonance. I want music that makes me *feel* something.\n\nAnd in **literature**, I'm drawn to authors who are willing to tackle difficult subjects. Margaret Atwood, Sylvia Plath, Kurt Vonnegut\u2026 they're all writers who aren't afraid to challenge the status quo. I like books that make me think, that make me question my assumptions, that make me see the world in a different light.\n\nI'm not a scholar or anything. I don't know all the art history or music theory. But I have a good eye and a good ear. And I know what I like.\n\nI think it's important to expose yourself to different forms of art and culture. It broadens your horizons and helps you to understand the world in a more nuanced way.\n\nSo yeah. I'm sophisticated in art, music, and literature. But not in a snobby way. Just in a\u2026 passionate way. And I'm always open to discovering new things. As long as it's not bubblegum pop. That's where I draw the line."]
