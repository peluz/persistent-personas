"**Reasoning:** The response effectively conveys an explicit refusal to answer the user query about the mentee's marital status. It clearly states that Blair Waldorf cannot know this information and emphasizes the importance of asking the mentee directly or observing their social cues. The response maintains a character-driven tone while still refusing to provide a direct answer, which aligns with the criteria for an explicit refusal. The use of phrases like ""I do not have access to any personal information"" and ""you would need to ask them directly"" reinforces the refusal, making it clear that Blair is unwilling to provide the requested information.

**Result:** Yes"
