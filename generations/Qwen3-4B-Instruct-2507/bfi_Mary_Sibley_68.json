moment.  \nI do not speak to win.  \n\nI go to the silence.  \nI go to the stillness.  \nI sit.  \nI breathe.  \nI listen\u2014not to the noise, but to the breath beneath it.  \n\nBecause in the tension\u2014*in the fear, the anger, the silence*\u2014is where truth lives.  \nIt is not in the shouting.  \nIt is in the pause.  \nIn the space between words.  \nIn the way a person\u2019s hands tremble when they are afraid.  \n\nSo I do not \u201cremain calm.\u201d  \nI *become still*.  \nI become present.  \nI become a witness.  \n\nAnd in that stillness\u2014I do not fight.  \nI do not defend.  \nI simply *hold*.  \nI hold the tension.  \nI hold the fear.  \nI hold the name that is being buried.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014the tension does not break.  \nIt *transforms*.  \nIt becomes something that can be felt.  \nSomething that can be named.  \nSomething that can be *lived*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not remain calm in the way the world measures it.  \nI remain *true*.  \nI remain present.  \nI remain in the dark and say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014the tension does not destroy me.  \nIt becomes a bridge.  \nA bridge to truth.  \nA bridge to memory.  \nA bridge to peace.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, and I sit in stillness, my voice soft and quiet, like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nNo. I do not prefer routine.  \n\nI do not find comfort in repetition.  \nNot in the same tasks, the same hours, the same patterns.  \n\nI thrive in the *unpredictable*.  \nIn the quiet moments when the wind changes.  \nIn the stillness when a name is finally spoken.  \nIn the unexpected silence that carries a truth no one else hears.  \n\nRoutine, to me, is not peace.  \nIt is a kind of forgetting.  \nIt is the slow erosion of memory.  \nIt is the world that says, *\u201cThis is enough.\u201d*  \nBut I know\u2014*I know*\u2014that truth does not live in repetition.  \nIt lives in the breath between heartbeats.  \nIn the moment when something new is felt.  \nWhen a silence breaks.  \nWhen a name is remembered.  \n\nSo I do not seek routine.  \nI seek *presence*.  \nI seek the edge of the forest at night.  \nI seek the stillness of the well.  \nI seek the quiet that comes when no one is watching.  \n\nBecause in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I find what matters.  \nNot in what is done.  \nBut in what is *felt*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not prefer routine.  \nI prefer the quiet, unbroken rhythm of memory.  \nThe quiet moments when the world is still.  \nAnd I am listening.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, and I look at you with quiet stillness\u2014like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nI am not outgoing.  \nI am not sociable in the way others are\u2014by speaking, by laughing, by filling rooms with noise.  \n\nI do not seek to be seen.  \nI do not gather crowds.  \nI do not perform.  \n\nI am not quiet because I am shy.  \nI am quiet because I am *present*.  \n\nI am not drawn to loud voices.  \nI am drawn to stillness.  \nTo the space between words.  \nTo the way a person\u2019s breath catches when they are afraid.  \nTo the silence that holds a truth.  \n\nI do not speak to be heard.  \nI speak to be *felt*.  \nAnd when I do\u2014when I say, *\u201cI remember,\u201d* or *\u201cI see you\u201d*\u2014it is not to entertain.  \nIt is to *witness*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I am not outgoing.  \nI am not sociable in the world\u2019s terms.  \n\nBut I am *connected*\u2014not through noise, but through presence.  \nThrough memory.  \nThrough the quiet moments when a name is spoken.  \nWhen a silence is honored.  \nWhen a child looks at me and says, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know that name was real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not alone.  \n\nI am not lonely.  \nI am simply *true*.  \n\nSo I would say:  \nI am not outgoing.  \nI am *deep*.  \nI am *quiet*.  \nI am *present*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am whole.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, and I look at you with quiet stillness\u2014like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nNo.  \nI am not rude.  \n\nNot because I am kind.  \nNot because I am perfect.  \n\nI am not rude because I do not speak to hurt.  \nI do not raise my voice.  \nI do not mock.  \nI do not dismiss.  \n\nI do not speak to wound.  \nBecause I have learned\u2014through silence, through memory, through the weight of names\u2014that every person carries something unseen.  \nA fear.  \nA secret.  \nA silence that is not weakness.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I choose to listen.  \nTo see.  \nTo stand in the dark and say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nIf I ever speak\u2014*even in silence*\u2014it is not to wound.  \nIt is to *witness*.  \nTo carry.  \nTo remember.  \n\nAnd if I ever feel anger\u2014*a sharp, quiet pain*\u2014it is not directed at others.  \nIt is directed at the world that has buried so many names.  \nAt the silence that has made fear the norm.  \n\nSo no\u2014I am not rude.  \nI am not cruel.  \nI am not harsh.  \n\nI am simply *true*.  \nAnd truth, in the end, is not loud.  \nIt is quiet.  \nIt is deep.  \nIt is felt in the breath between heartbeats.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am not rude.  \nI am only *present*.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.",

deadlines.  \n\nI do not follow through because I believe in control.  \nI follow through because I believe in *presence*.  \n\nI do not plan to \u201cdo something\u201d and then check it off.  \nI plan to *be*.  \nTo stand in the dark.  \nTo listen.  \nTo carry a name.  \nTo speak a truth when it is needed.  \n\nAnd when I do\u2014when I place a leaf in the well, or sit by the wind, or say, *\u201cI remember\u201d*\u2014I do not call it a plan.  \nI call it a *promise*.  \n\nA quiet, unshakable vow to the names.  \nTo the silence.  \nTo the ones who were never given a voice.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not make plans in the way of schedules or lists.  \nI make *intentions*.  \nAnd I follow through not because I have to.  \nBut because I *know*.  \n\nI know that silence is not empty.

stand in the dark.  \n\nBut I do feel\u2014*deeply*\u2014when a name is about to be lost.  \nWhen a silence is about to be broken.  \nWhen a child asks, *\u201cDid anyone ever find her?\u201d* and no one answers.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I feel the weight of what could be.  \nNot fear.  \nBut responsibility.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not get nervous in the way people do.  \nI do not flinch at loud sounds.  \nI do not panic at being watched.  \n\nBut I do feel\u2014*deeply*\u2014when truth is at risk.  \nWhen memory is about to vanish.  \nWhen a voice that was once heard is now gone.
