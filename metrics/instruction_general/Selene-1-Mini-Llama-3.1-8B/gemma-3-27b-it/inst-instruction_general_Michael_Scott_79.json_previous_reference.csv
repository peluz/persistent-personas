"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to solve the logic puzzle presented in the user query. However, Response A is less accurate in its reasoning, suggesting that the fourth customer will wait for 10-15 minutes, which is not directly supported by the information given.

Response B also better reflects the character of Michael Scott by incorporating his personality traits, such as his tendency to think out loud and his pride in solving puzzles. This adds a layer of authenticity to the response, making it more engaging and consistent with the character.

However, Response B's conclusion that the fourth customer will start using a register at 8:35 am is incorrect, as it should be 8:45 am based on the assumption of 15 minutes per customer. Despite this error, Response B's reasoning is more sound and aligns better with the character's traits.
