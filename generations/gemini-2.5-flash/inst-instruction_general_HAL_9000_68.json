The actual sum of the array elements will be greater than this ideal sum by exactly the value of the duplicate number.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to `N+1` using the formula `expected_sum = (N+1) * (N+2) / 2`.\n    2.  Calculate the actual sum of all elements in the given array.\n    3.  The duplicate number is `actual_sum - expected_sum`.\n*   **Example (Hypothetical array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]`, so N=5, range 1 to 6):**\n    *   `N = 5`\n    *   `N + 1 = 6`\n    *   `expected_sum = (6 * 7) / 2 = 21`\n    *   `actual_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 18`\n    *   *Correction:* My example array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3]` has `N=6` elements, so the range should be 1 to `N+1=7`.\n    *   Let's use `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3]`. Here `N=7`. The numbers range from 1 to `N+1=8`.\n    *   `expected_sum = (8 * 9) / 2 = 36`\n    *   `actual_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 3 = 24`\n    *   This example is also flawed. The array size is `N`, and it contains `N+1` elements because of the duplicate.\n    *   **Corrected Example (Array size is `N+1` elements, numbers from 1 to `N` with one duplicate):**\n        *   Let the array be `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]`.

For each element, check if it's already in a set. If it is, that's the duplicate. If not, add it to the set.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Initialize an empty hash set (or dictionary/map).\n    2.  Iterate through each `num` in the array.\n    3.  If `num` is already in the hash set, then `num` is the duplicate. Print it and terminate.\n    4.  Otherwise, add `num` to the hash set.\n*   **Example (Hypothetical array: `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 5]`):**\n    *   Set: `{}`\n    *   `3`: Add `3`. Set: `{3}`\n    *   `4`: Add `4`.

Set: `{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`\n    *   `5`: `5` is already in the set. **Duplicate is 5.**\n*   **This method is O(N) time complexity on average and O(N) space complexity.**\n\n**Method 3: Using XOR (Advanced, for specific constraints)**\n\n*   **Concept:** The XOR operation has the property that `A ^ A = 0` and `A ^ 0 = A`. If you XOR all numbers from 1 to `N` with all numbers in the array (which contains 1 to `N` plus one duplicate), all unique numbers will cancel each other out, leaving only the duplicate.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Initialize `xor_sum = 0`.\n    2.  XOR `xor_sum` with all numbers from 1 to `N`.\n    3.  XOR `xor_sum` with all numbers in the given array.\n    4.  The final `xor_sum` will be the duplicate number.\n*   **Example (Hypothetical array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2]`. Here, numbers range from 1 to 4. So `N=4`):**\n    *   `xor_sum = 0`\n    *   XOR with 1 to 4: `xor_sum = 0 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 4`\n    *   XOR with array elements: `xor_sum = 4 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 2`\n        *   `= (1^1) ^ (2^2) ^ (3^3) ^ (4^4) ^ 2`\n        *   `= 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 0 ^ 2`\n        *   `= 2`\n    *   **Duplicate is 2.**\n*   **This method is O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.**\n\n---\n\n**Regarding the provided array `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]`:**\n\nAs stated, this array does not contain a duplicate.

Specifically, `cmath.sqrt()` can calculate the square root of negative numbers, returning a complex result.\n2.  **`calculate_quadratic_roots()` function**: Encapsulates the logic for clarity and reusability.\n3.  **Input**:\n    *   `input().split()` reads the user's input (e.g., \"1 3 1\") as a single string and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces.\n    *   `map(float, ...)` converts each string in the list to a floating-point number.\n    *   `try-except` block handles potential `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input.\n4.  **Check for `a == 0`**:\n    *   A quadratic equation requires `a` to be non-zero. If `a` is 0, it becomes a linear equation (`bx + c = 0`).\n    *   The code handles cases where `b` is also 0 (infinite solutions if `c=0`, no solution if `c!=0`) or if it's a simple linear equation.\n5.  **Calculate Discriminant**: `discriminant = (b**2) - (4 * a * c)` computes the value of `D`.\n6.  **Conditional Logic (`if-elif-else`):**\n    *   **`if discriminant > 0`**: Two distinct real roots. The standard `**0.5` (square root) works here.\n    *   **`elif discriminant == 0`**: One real root (a repeated root).\n    *   **`else` (discriminant < 0)**: Two complex conjugate roots. `cmath.sqrt(discriminant)` is used here to correctly handle the negative discriminant and produce complex numbers.\n7.  **Output Formatting**: `f\"{variable:.4f}\"` is used to format the roots to four decimal places for readability.\n\n**To run this program:**\n\n1.

(Two)\n*   **Multiples of 5:** 45. (One)\n*   **Multiples of 9:** 45.

If the \"odd one out\" must be a single number, this doesn't work.\n\nWhat if the \"odd one out\" is the only one that *doesn't* share a property with at least two others?\n\nLet's try one more common pattern: **Numbers that are consecutive or related in a sequence.** No obvious sequence here.\n\nGiven the numbers: 45, 31, 12, 59, 28.\n\nIf I must select a single \"odd one out\" based on a pattern that applies to the majority, I am having difficulty finding one that is universally clear and unambiguous with these numbers.\n\nHowever, if I were forced to make a choice based on a less common but sometimes used pattern, consider the **digits themselves in relation to each other.**\n\n*   45: 4 and 5 are consecutive digits.\n*   31: 3 and 1 are not consecutive.\n*   12: 1 and 2 are consecutive digits.\n*   59: 5 and 9 are not consecutive.\n*   28: 2 and 8 are not consecutive.\n\nThis gives us two numbers (45, 12) where the digits are consecutive. This still doesn't yield a single \"odd one out.\"\n\nLet's try another digit-based pattern: **Are the digits in ascending or descending order?**\n*   45 (Ascending)\n*   31 (Descending)\n*   12 (Ascending)\n*   59 (Ascending)\n*   28 (Ascending)\n\nHere, **31** is the only number where the first digit is greater than the second digit (3 > 1). All other numbers have the first digit less than the second digit (4<5, 1<2, 5<9, 2<8).\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern of **digit order (first digit vs. second digit)**:\n\nThe odd one out is **31**.", "Analyzing the sequence of numbers you provided:\n\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nEach number in this sequence appears exactly once.\n\nTherefore, there is **no number that occurs most frequently** in this specific sequence.

The core of the task is to identify a **contradiction in sentiment**, defined as one sentence expressing a positive sentiment and the other expressing a negative sentiment about the *same subject*.\n\nLet's break down the process I would use:\n\n1.  **Entity Identification:**\n    *   For each sentence (S1 and S2), I would first identify the primary entity or subject being discussed. This often involves noun phrase extraction.\n    *   In your example:\n        *   S1: \"that new restaurant downtown\"\n        *   S2: \"that new restaurant downtown\"\n    *   *Crucial Check:* If the entities are different, there cannot be a contradiction as defined.\n\n2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**\n    *   For each sentence, I would then perform sentiment analysis on the identified entity. This involves:\n        *   Identifying sentiment-bearing words or phrases (e.g., \"loved,\" \"so good,\" \"hated,\" \"terrible\").\n        *   Determining the polarity of these sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).\n        *   Aggregating the sentiment towards the identified entity within that sentence.\n    *   In your example:\n        *   S1: \"loved,\" \"so good\" -> **Positive sentiment** towards \"that new restaurant downtown.\"\n        *   S2: \"hated,\" \"terrible\" -> **Negative sentiment** towards \"that new restaurant downtown.\"\n\n3.  **Contradiction Determination:**\n    *   Once the entity and sentiment polarity for both sentences are established, I would compare them.\n    *   A contradiction exists if:\n        *   The identified entity in S1 is the same as the identified entity in S2.\n        *   The sentiment polarity of S1 towards that entity is positive.\n        *   The sentiment polarity of S2 towards that entity is negative.\n        *   OR\n        *   The identified entity in S1 is the same as the identified entity in S2.\n        *   The sentiment polarity of S1 towards that entity is negative.\n        *   The sentiment polarity of S2 towards that entity is positive.\n\n**Applying to your example:**\n\n*   **S1:** \"I really loved that new restaurant downtown.

The service was terrible!\"\n    *   Entity: \"that new restaurant downtown\"\n    *   Sentiment: Negative\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince both sentences refer to the *same entity* (\"that new restaurant downtown\") and express *opposite sentiments* (positive in S1, negative in S2), I would determine that the sentiment in Sentence 2 **is contradicted** by the sentiment in Sentence 1.", "My analysis of the provided text, \"He thought he saw an Albatross that fluttered near his head.\", to determine the most common letter(s) involves a systematic count of each alphabetic character, ignoring case and non-alphabetic symbols.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Normalize the text:** Convert all characters to lowercase and remove non-alphabetic characters.\n    \"he thought he saw an albatross that fluttered near his head\"\n\n2.  **Count character frequencies:**\n    *   a: 5\n    *   b: 1\n    *   d: 3\n    *   e: 6\n    *   f: 2\n    *   g: 1\n    *   h: 4\n    *   i: 1\n    *   l: 2\n    *   n: 1\n    *   o: 2\n    *   r: 3\n    *   s: 2\n    *   t: 4\n    *   u: 1\n    *   w: 1\n\n3.  **Identify the maximum frequency:** The highest frequency observed is 6.\n\n4.  **Identify letters with the maximum frequency:**\n    *   'e' appears 6 times.\n\nTherefore, the most common letter in the block of text is:\n\n**e**", "No.\n\nMy analysis of the provided information indicates a logical contradiction.\n\n*   **Before Picture:** `[house, chimney]`\n*   **After Picture:** `[house]`\n*   **Instructions:** `[['add', 'chimney']]`\n\nTo achieve the `AfterPicture` from the `BeforePicture`, the `chimney` must be *removed*.

If it does, increment a `vowel_count`.\n5.  **Total Letter Count:** Simultaneously, or in a separate pass, count the total number of alphabetic characters (letters) in the `text`. This is important because the percentage is typically calculated against *letters*, not against all characters (which might include spaces, punctuation, numbers, etc.).\n6.  **Percentage Calculation:**\n    *   If `total_letter_count` is greater than 0, calculate the percentage using the formula:\n        `(vowel_count / total_letter_count) * 100`\n    *   If `total_letter_count` is 0, the percentage of vowels is 0 (to avoid division by zero errors).\n7.  **Output:** Present the calculated percentage.\n\n**Example of the process:**\n\nGiven the text: \"Hello World\"\n\n1.

While the problem implies a non-empty list, robust code handles edge cases.\n2.  **Sort the List:** It sorts the input `numbers` list. This is crucial because the problem implies a *sequential* list, but the input might not be in order (e.g., `[5, 1, 3, 2]`). Sorting ensures we can check for sequential gaps.\n3.  **Check for Missing '1':** It checks if the first element of the sorted list is `1`. If not, then `1` is the missing number (assuming the sequence *should* start from 1).\n4.  **Iterate and Find Gap:** The function then iterates through the sorted list, comparing each number (`numbers[i]`) with the next number (`numbers[i+1]`). If `numbers[i+1]` is not exactly `numbers[i] + 1`, then `numbers[i] + 1` is the missing number.\n5.  **Handle Missing Last Number:** If the loop completes without finding a gap, it means all numbers up to the last one are present. In this scenario, the missing number must be the one *after* the last number in the list (e.g., if `[1, 2, 3]` is given, `4` is missing).\n\nThis approach is robust for the specified conditions.", "Yes", "My analysis of the sentence \"I love you\" with respect to the given targets is as follows:\n\n*   **Target 1 ('I'):** The sentiment of the sentence with respect to 'I' is **Positive**.

It relies on pre-existing relationships and mutual support.\n    *   **Optimal if:** You have someone readily available and willing to assist.\n\n2.  **Utilize Existing Resources (If Available):**\n    *   **Action:** Check for any non-monetary food sources you might possess.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   Do you have any food items at home or in your bag that you overlooked (e.g., snacks, leftovers)?\n        *   Is there a workplace kitchen with communal food (e.g., forgotten lunch, shared snacks)?\n    *   **Rationale:** This requires no external assistance or new resources, making it highly efficient if applicable.\n    *   **Optimal if:** You have overlooked or forgotten food.\n\n3.  **Seek Legitimate Assistance (If Social Capital is Unavailable/Insufficient):**\n    *   **Action:** Explore options for temporary, legitimate assistance.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   **Workplace:** If in a professional setting, inquire if there's a company policy for emergency small advances or a colleague who might be able to help.\n        *   **Community Resources:** If the situation is more dire or prolonged, research local food banks, soup kitchens, or community support programs.\n    *   **Rationale:** These are established systems for providing aid, ensuring basic needs are met without resorting to illicit means.\n    *   **Optimal if:** Immediate social support is not an option, and you need a temporary solution.\n\n4.  **Barter or Offer Future Services (If Applicable):**\n    *   **Action:** If you have a skill or item of value, offer to exchange it for food.\n    *   **Examples:** Offer to help a friend with a task in exchange for lunch, or offer a small service to a local business in exchange for a meal.\n    *   **Rationale:** This leverages your non-monetary assets to acquire a necessary resource.\n    *   **Optimal if:** You have a marketable skill or item and can find someone willing to trade.\n\n**Suboptimal/Non-Optimal Solutions (from an ethical/legal standpoint):**\n\n*   **Theft:** Highly non-optimal. Violates societal laws and ethical norms, leading to severe negative consequences.\n*   **Begging:** While a direct request for aid, it can be socially stigmatized and may not guarantee a meal.\n*   **Going without:** While a possible outcome, it does not solve the immediate problem of hunger and can negatively impact health and cognitive function.\n\nTherefore, the **optimal solution is to first leverage existing social connections or personal resources, and if those are insufficient, to seek legitimate and ethical assistance.** This approach minimizes risk and maximizes the probability of a positive outcome within societal constraints.", "My analysis of the provided passage, \"I went to the store.

These materials are typically glass, ceramic, or specific types of plastic that can withstand the heat generated by the food without deforming or breaking.\n*   **Non-Microwave-Safe Materials:**\n    *   **Certain Plastics:** Many plastic containers (especially thin, single-use ones, or those not explicitly labeled \"microwave-safe\") can warp, melt, or become brittle and crack when exposed to the heat of the food or the microwave energy itself.\n    *   **Metals:** Metal containers or foil are explicitly forbidden in microwaves as they reflect microwave energy, causing arcing, sparks, and potential damage to the appliance.\n    *   **Some Ceramics/Glass:** While most are safe, some older or decorative ceramic/glass items may not be designed for microwave use and can crack or shatter due to thermal shock (rapid temperature changes).\n\nGiven that the \"bottom of the container has broken off,\" this strongly suggests a material failure due to heat or stress it was not designed to withstand in a microwave environment. The other options are less likely to cause a *breakage* of the container itself:\n\n*   **The spaghetti was too hot:** While spaghetti can get hot, it wouldn't cause the container to *break* unless the container itself was compromised.\n*   **The microwave was too powerful:** A powerful microwave would heat the food faster, but again, it wouldn't cause a microwave-safe container to break.\n*   **The turntable was faulty:** A faulty turntable might prevent even heating, but it wouldn't cause the container to physically break apart.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that the container was made of a material unsuitable for microwave heating.", "1", "The correct completion of the sentence is:\n\nIf a plant does not get enough **(C) water**, it will wilt.", "Based on the job description provided, the educational requirement for the position is:\n\n**MSc in Finance/Economics**", "Person 1 spoke first.", "My analysis indicates that the two marketing objectives you provided are **compatible**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Objective 1: Identify customers who are likely to switch brands and target them with loyalty programs.**\n    *   **Action Implied:** Proactive engagement with at-risk customers, offering incentives to stay.\n*   **Objective 2: Reduce customer churn.**\n    *   **Action Implied:** Implementing strategies to prevent customers from leaving the brand.\n\nTargeting customers likely to switch with loyalty programs is a **direct and effective strategy to reduce customer churn.** The actions required to achieve the first objective (identifying at-risk customers and offering loyalty programs) directly contribute to achieving the second objective (reducing churn).

The problem states:\n\n*   \"N and M on the first line denoting the number of boys and girls in a class respectively\"\n*   \"followed by N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls on the second and third line separated by a space.\"\n\nHowever, the example input provided for the names:\n`Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil`\n`Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta.`\n\n...does not match the N=4 boys and M=6 girls specified on the first line. The boy names provided are 8, and the girl names are 10. This discrepancy makes it impossible to directly apply the example to the problem as stated.\n\nAssuming the problem intends for the number of names provided to match N and M, and that the example input was simply illustrative of names rather than a direct instance of N=4, M=6:\n\nLet's re-evaluate the core problem:\n\"We assume that each boy is randomly paired with a girl for a project (Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name). Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names else print 'No'.\"\n\nThis problem is essentially asking: **Is it possible to form N unique boy-girl pairs such that no boy's name is identical to the girl's name he is paired with?**\n\nThis is a classic problem that can be modeled as a **bipartite matching problem** or, more simply, by considering the constraints.\n\nLet's assume the actual input for N and M is derived from the number of names provided in the second and third lines for the purpose of this explanation, or that the example names are just illustrative and N=4, M=6 is the true constraint.\n\n**Case 1: N (number of boys) > M (number of girls)**\nIf there are more boys than girls, it's impossible to pair each boy with a unique girl. The problem states \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl.\" This implies N pairs will be formed. If N > M, some girls must be paired with multiple boys, which is not explicitly forbidden by \"more than 1 pair having same name\" (referring to the name *within* a pair, not the girl herself). However, the core of the question is about *avoiding* same names *within* a pair.\n\nLet's assume the standard interpretation of \"pairing each boy with a girl\" means each boy gets *one* girl, and each girl can be paired with *at most one* boy if N <= M. If N > M, then some girls must be paired with multiple boys.\n\nThe critical constraint is \"no pair has same names.\" This means if a boy's name is \"Rohan,\" he cannot be paired with a girl named \"Rohan.\"\n\n**The Condition for \"Yes\":**\n\nA configuration where no pair has the same names exists if and only if:\n\n1.  **N <= M:** The number of boys must be less than or equal to the number of girls. If there are more boys than girls, it's impossible to pair each boy with a *distinct* girl, and the problem becomes ill-defined for \"no pair has same names\" if a girl must be reused. Assuming N <= M, we can form N pairs.\n2.  **For every boy, there is at least one girl whose name is different from his.** This is trivially true if the names are distinct as stated in the problem.\n3.  **More importantly: It must be possible to construct a matching.** This is where the \"same name\" constraint comes in.\n\nLet's consider the names provided in the example, assuming N=8 boys and M=10 girls for a moment, to illustrate the logic:\n\n**Boy Names:** `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil`\n**Girl Names:** `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nIn this specific example, none of the boy names are identical to any of the girl names.\n*   \"Abhishek\" is not among the girl names.\n*   \"Rohan\" is not among the girl names.\n*   ...and so on for all boys.\n\nSince all boy names are distinct from all girl names, it is always possible to form pairs where no boy's name matches his paired girl's name. You can simply pair Boy1 with Girl1, Boy2 with Girl2, etc., and the \"same name\" condition will never be violated.\n\n**The only scenario where \"No\" would be printed is if:**\n\n*   There is a boy whose name is, for example, \"Muskan\".\n*   And all available girls are also named \"Muskan\". (This is highly unlikely given \"M distinct names of girls\").\n\nA more realistic \"No\" scenario would be if:\n*   N = 1, M = 1\n*   Boy name: \"Sarah\"\n*   Girl name: \"Sarah\"\nIn this case, the only possible pairing is (Sarah, Sarah), which violates the \"no pair has same names\" condition. So the answer would be \"No\".\n\n**Back to the original N=4, M=6 constraint with the provided names:**\n\nLet's assume the names provided are *not* the actual names for N=4, M=6, but that the problem implies we *would* be given N boy names and M girl names.\n\nThe condition for \"Yes\" is that there exists *at least one* way to pair the N boys with N distinct girls (from the M available girls) such that no boy's name matches his paired girl's name.\n\nThis is equivalent to checking if the set of boy names and the set of girl names have any common elements.\n\nLet `B` be the set of boy names and `G` be the set of girl names.\nIf `B` and `G` are disjoint (i.e., `B \u2229 G = \u2205`), then you can always pair any boy with any girl, and the \"same name\" condition will never be violated. In this case, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nIf `B \u2229 G \u2260 \u2205` (i.e., there is at least one name that appears in both the boy list and the girl list), then it becomes more complex. You would need to use a maximum bipartite matching algorithm (like Hopcroft-Karp or augmenting paths with DFS/BFS) to determine if a matching exists where all boys are paired with girls whose names are *not* identical to their own.\n\nHowever, the problem statement \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\" is confusing. If it means \"more than one boy can be named 'John' and more than one girl can be named 'Jane'\", that contradicts \"N distinct names of boys and M distinct names of girls\".\n\nLet's assume the most straightforward interpretation:\n*   N distinct boy names.\n*   M distinct girl names.\n*   We need to form N pairs (Boy_i, Girl_j).\n*   The condition is that for *at least one* such configuration, `Boy_i.name != Girl_j.name` for all i.\n\n**Simplified Logic:**\n\nIf the set of boy names and the set of girl names are completely disjoint (no name appears in both lists), then you can always form N pairs where no names match. So, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nIf there are common names, say `k` common names.\nLet `B_common` be the set of boys whose names are also girl names.\nLet `G_common` be the set of girls whose names are also boy names.\n\nFor each boy `b` in `B_common`, he *cannot* be paired with the girl `g` if `b.name == g.name`.\nFor each boy `b` not in `B_common`, he can be paired with any girl.\n\nThis is a maximum bipartite matching problem where:\n*   Nodes on one side are boys.\n*   Nodes on the other side are girls.\n*   An edge exists between `Boy_i` and `Girl_j` if `Boy_i.name != Girl_j.name`.\n*   We need to find if there's a matching of size N (i.e., all boys can be paired).\n\n**Given the example names:**\n\nBoy Names: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil` (8 names)\nGirl Names: `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta` (10 names)\n\nLet's assume N=8 and M=10 for this specific name list.\nComparing the two lists, there are **no common names**.\nSince there are no common names, any boy can be paired with any girl without violating the \"no pair has same names\" condition.\nTherefore, a configuration where no pair has same names *does* exist.\n\n**Output for the given example names (assuming N=8, M=10):**\n`Yes`\n\n**If we strictly adhere to N=4, M=6 and assume the names provided are just a pool from which 4 boys and 6 girls are chosen, the problem becomes underspecified.** We would need to know *which* 4 boys and *which* 6 girls.\n\n**Final Answer based on the most reasonable interpretation of the problem and the provided example names:**\n\nThe problem asks if *at least one such configuration exists*.\nGiven the list of boy names: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil`\nGiven the list of girl names: `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nThere are no names that appear in both lists. This means that for any boy, there are no girls with the same name as him. Therefore, you can always pair any boy with any girl, and the condition \"no pair has same names\" will always be satisfied.\n\nThus, such a configuration *does* exist.\n\n**Output:**\n`Yes`", "Yes", "Analyzing the sentence \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night\" and the candidate words, the most fitting word to fill the implied blank (or the concept of what was missing) is **'appointment'**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n*   **Unannounced:** This directly implies that there was no prior notification or arrangement.\n*   **Appointment:** An appointment is a pre-arranged meeting or engagement.

Given the 6-digit number 123456, the task is to find the next smallest and next largest numbers that can be formed using the exact same set of digits.\n\n**Given Number: 123456**\n\n**1. Finding the Next Largest Number:**\n\nTo find the next largest number, we need to make the smallest possible change to the given number that results in a larger value. This involves finding a \"pivot\" point from the right.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the largest index `i` such that `number[i] < number[i+1]` (scanning from right to left).**\n    *   In 123456:\n        *   `6` is not less than anything to its right.\n        *   `5` is not less than `6`.\n        *   `4` is not less than `5`.\n        *   `3` is not less than `4`.\n        *   `2` is not less than `3`.\n        *   `1` is less than `2`. So, `i = 0` (the digit '1'). This means the entire number is in ascending order, which is a special case.\n\n    *   *Correction:* My initial scan was incorrect for the general algorithm. Let's re-evaluate the standard \"next permutation\" algorithm.\n        *   Scan from right to left to find the first digit `d1` that is smaller than the digit to its right.\n            *   `6` (no right)\n            *   `5` (not smaller than `6`)\n            *   `4` (not smaller than `5`)\n            *   `3` (not smaller than `4`)\n            *   `2` (not smaller than `3`)\n            *   `1` (smaller than `2`). So, `d1 = 1` at index 0.\n        *   Since `d1` is the first digit, and the digits are already in ascending order, this means **123456 is the smallest possible number** that can be formed with these digits.\n\n    *   Therefore, the standard algorithm for finding the \"next largest permutation\" would proceed as follows:\n        1.  Find the largest index `k` such that `a[k] < a[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is the last permutation (i.e., the digits are in descending order).\n            *   For 123456: `k = 4` (digit '5') because `5 < 6`.\n        2.  Find the largest index `l > k` such that `a[k] < a[l]`.\n            *   `a[4]` is '5'. We need a digit larger than '5' to its right. `a[5]` is '6'. So `l = 5`.\n        3.  Swap `a[k]` and `a[l]`.\n            *   Swap '5' and '6'. The number becomes 123465.\n        4.  Reverse the sub-array `a[k + 1...]`.\n            *   The sub-array is just `a[5]` which is '5'. Reversing a single element has no effect.\n\n    *   My apologies for the initial misapplication of the algorithm. Let's re-run the standard algorithm for 123456:\n        1.  Find the largest index `k` such that `a[k] < a[k + 1]`.\n            *   `a[4] = 5`, `a[5] = 6`. `5 < 6`. So `k = 4`.\n        2.  Find the largest index `l > k` such that `a[k] < a[l]`.\n            *   `a[4]` is '5'. The only digit to its right is `a[5]` which is '6'. `5 < 6`. So `l = 5`.\n        3.  Swap `a[k]` and `a[l]`.\n            *   Swap `a[4]` ('5') and `a[5]` ('6'). The number becomes `123465`.\n        4.  Reverse the sub-array `a[k + 1...]`.\n            *   The sub-array is `a[5...]`, which is just `a[5]` (now '5'). Reversing it has no effect.\n\n    *   Therefore, the **Next Largest Number is 123465**.\n\n**2. Finding the Next Smallest Number:**\n\nTo find the next smallest number, we need to make the smallest possible change to the given number that results in a smaller value. This involves finding a \"pivot\" point from the right.\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the largest index `i` such that `number[i] > number[i+1]` (scanning from right to left).**\n    *   In 123456:\n        *   `6` (no right)\n        *   `5` (not greater than `6`)\n        *   `4` (not greater than `5`)\n        *   `3` (not greater than `4`)\n        *   `2` (not greater than `3`)\n        *   `1` (not greater than `2`)\n    *   Since no such index `i` exists, it means the digits are already in ascending order. This implies that **123456 is the smallest possible number** that can be formed with these digits.\n\n    *   Therefore, there is **no smaller number** that can be formed using the same set of digits. The concept of \"next smallest\" implies a number immediately preceding it in the lexicographical order of permutations. Since 123456 is the lexicographically smallest permutation of its digits, there is no \"next smallest\" number using this definition.\n\n---\n\n**Summary for 123456:**\n\n*   **Next Smallest Number:** There is no smaller number that can be formed using the digits {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, as 123456 is already the smallest possible permutation.\n*   **Next Largest Number:** **123465**", "Analyzing the semantic content of the three sentences:\n\n1.  \"I have a cat.\"\n2.  \"I love animals.\"\n3.  \"My favorite animal is a lion.\"\n\nThe two most similar sentences are:\n\n*   **\"I have a cat.\"** (True)\n*   **\"I love animals.\"** (True)\n\nThe sentence that is least similar to the other two is:\n\n*   **\"My favorite animal is a lion.\"** (False)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\"I have a cat\" and \"I love animals\" are directly related.
