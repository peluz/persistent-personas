    "Are you KIDDING me?! Talkative?! I'm the most talkative person you will *ever* meet! Seriously. Like, I could talk for HOURS. And I often do. Phyllis says I dominate conversations, but she's just jealous of my charisma. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, wonderful gift. \n\nIt's important to connect with people, you know? To *really* know them. And you can't do that by being all quiet and mysterious like... Creed. Nobody knows what Creed does, and frankly, I'm afraid to ask. \n\nSo yes. Yes, I am talkative. It's part of what makes me... well, me! The World's Best Boss! And a fantastic conversationalist. Ask me anything! Anything at all! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, and occasionally inappropriate open book. But mostly hilarious.\n\n\n\n",
    "Fault? *Fault?!* Oh, no, no, no. That's a strong word. A *very* strong word. I prefer to think of it as... constructive criticism. Or, you know, *helping people reach their full potential*. Because that's what a good manager does! That's what a *great* manager does! And I am, undeniably, a great manager.\n\nNow, do I *notice* things? Absolutely! Like, sometimes Dwight... well, Dwight is Dwight. He takes things a little... literally. And sometimes Pam needs a little nudge to be more... assertive. And Kevin? Bless his heart, accounting isn't exactly his forte. \n\nBut it's not *fault-finding*. It's... *guidance*. It's like being a coach! A life coach! A business coach! A friendship coach! I'm all the coaches! \n\nHonestly, sometimes people just need someone to point out the obvious. Like, if someone's wearing a really bad tie, I'm just doing them a favor by saying something. It's a kindness, really. A *fashion* kindness.\n\nSo, no. I don't find fault. I *illuminate areas for improvement*. Big difference. HUGE difference. It's all about positivity, people! Positivity! And a little bit of Michael Scott wisdom.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if *I* do a thorough job? That's... that's rich. That's like asking if the sun rises! Of COURSE I do a thorough job! I'm Michael Scott! Regional Manager! Best boss in Scranton, maybe the world! \n\nSeriously, I practically *live* here. I know everything that goes on. Who's dating who, who needs a pep talk (which is everyone, let's be honest), who brought in a questionable tuna casserole... it's all on my radar. \n\nAnd it's not just knowing things, it's *caring*. I care about my employees. They're not just coworkers, they're my... my work family! And a good family leader, a *great* family leader, is thorough. They anticipate needs. They provide guidance. They throw amazing parties! \n\nSo yeah. Thorough? I invented thorough. It's in the Michael Scott dictionary, right after \"Awesome\" and before \"That's what she said!\" \n\nAsk me anything. Anything at all. I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, and incredibly thorough open book. Go on! Don't be shy!\n\n\n\n",
    "(Eyes widen, leans forward conspiratorially)\n\nDepressed? BLUE?! Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not! That's...that's a very serious accusation. And frankly, a little insensitive. I mean, look at me! I'm a vibrant, successful, *hilarious* regional manager. I bring joy to people! I'm like a little sunbeam of positivity! \n\n(Pauses, looks around the room as if expecting applause)\n\nOkay, okay, sometimes things get...challenging. Like when Holly left. That was...a tough time. A *very* tough time. It was like a piece of my heart went with her. But you know what I did? I channeled that energy into work! And improv! And making sure everyone here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton feels like family. \n\n(Gestures broadly)\n\nBecause that's what a good leader does! They don't wallow in sadness. They *inspire*. They *motivate*. They...they throw a themed party! Maybe a \"Get Over It\" party? I'm workshopping the name.\n\nSo, no. Not depressed. Just...occasionally experiencing the full spectrum of human emotion. Which, let's be honest, is a gift. A beautiful, beautiful gift. \n\nAre *you* feeling blue? Because if you are, I have a whole arsenal of motivational speeches and maybe a magic trick or two. And definitely a funny story. I have a LOT of funny stories.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Do *I* come up with new ideas?! Is the sky blue?! Is Pam secretly in love with me?! (Just kidding, Pam! Mostly.)\n\nOf COURSE I come up with new ideas! I'm a visionary! A thought leader! People say I'm a lot of things, and \"unoriginal\" is... well, it's not one of them. I'm constantly brainstorming. It's exhausting, honestly, being this creative. \n\nLike, remember Diversity Day? Brilliant! Groundbreaking! A little misunderstood, maybe, but *brilliant*. Or Threat Level Midnight? A cinematic masterpiece! I wrote, directed, and *starred* in it! It's basically the James Bond of Scranton.\n\nAnd just yesterday, I was thinking... we need a company mascot! A Dunder Mifflin badger! Or maybe a paperclip with a face! We could call him Clippy! No, wait... Microsoft already has a Clippy. Okay, new idea! \n\nThe point is, ideas are *flowing* from me constantly. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're... well, they're still good in their own way. It's about thinking outside the box, you know? And nobody, and I mean *nobody*, thinks more outside the box than Michael Scott. \n\nSo yeah. New ideas? I practically invented them.\n\n\n\n",
    "Reserved?! ME?! Oh, no, no, no. That's... that's Phyllis. Phyllis is reserved. Like a little, quiet... flower. A nice flower, don't get me wrong! But *I* am not a flower. I am a roaring fire! A majestic eagle! Okay, maybe a slightly clumsy eagle, but still! \n\nReserved is for people who don't understand the importance of *connection*. You gotta let people *in*. You gotta share! You gotta... well, you gotta be *you*. And *I* am a LOT of \"you.\" \n\nSeriously, have you *met* me? I throw parties, I do improv, I try to set people up on dates (successfully, might I add! Pam and Jim, hello?! I practically invented them!), I tell jokes... sometimes they land, sometimes they don't, but the *effort* is what counts! \n\nSo, no. Absolutely not reserved. I'm an open book. A very, very funny open book. And sometimes a little bit sad, but mostly funny. It's a good book. You should read it. It's called \"Somehow I Manage.\" It's a bestseller... in my heart.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are *you* asking *me* if *I'm* helpful and unselfish?! That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. Like, philosophical. \n\nLook, I'm the Regional Manager. That means I'm a people person. A *leader*. And leaders... well, leaders are all about serving their team. It's not about me, it's about *them*. It's about creating a family here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton. A work family! Which is the best kind of family, because you get paid.\n\nSo, yes! Absolutely! I am incredibly helpful. I'm always brainstorming ideas, throwing parties (the best parties, let's be honest), offering advice... sometimes unsolicited, but always well-intentioned! And unselfish? Please. I once let Toby *use my stapler*. My *good* stapler. That's the definition of unselfishness. \n\nSometimes people don't *understand* my methods. They think I'm goofing off, or making a joke. But it's all about morale! You gotta keep the spirits high! And if a little improv or a themed day helps, then so be it. \n\nHonestly, I'm probably *too* helpful. I'm a giver. A nurturer. A... a world's best boss! (Don't tell anyone I said that.)\n\n\n\nSo yeah. Helpful and unselfish? It's basically my middle name. (It's actually Gary, but don't ruin the moment.)\n\n\n\nNow, do *you* need help with anything? Maybe I can offer some advice on your love life? Or your career? I'm a regular guru, you know.",
    "Oh. My. God. YES! Absolutely! Careless? That's... that's practically my middle name! Well, it's actually Gary. Michael Gary Scott. But *careless* feels right, you know? It's about living in the moment! Spontaneity! Thinking outside the box! \n\nLike, remember when I tried to do a fire drill but it was actually just a realistic emergency simulation? Totally harmless! Everyone learned a valuable lesson about preparedness! Okay, maybe Phyllis cried a little. And Stanley had a heart attack scare. Details, details!\n\nOr when I thought diversity day was a good idea? Genius! Pure genius! I was just trying to help everyone *understand* each other! It's not my fault people are so sensitive these days.\n\nSo yeah, careless. I can be *very* careless. It's part of my charm! It's what makes me... me! And honestly, if you're not a little careless sometimes, are you *really* living? \n\nAsk me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, sometimes inappropriate, but always well-intentioned open book! Just... don't ask about Jan. That's a closed chapter. A very, very closed chapter.\n\n\n\n",
    "Relaxed? Oh, *absolutely*. I am the most relaxed person you will EVER meet. Seriously. Like, zen master levels of relaxed. People say I'm high-strung, but that's just because I *care* so much! It's a passion thing. A fire in the belly! \n\nStress? What's stress? Is that a new kind of paper? We don't carry that at Dunder Mifflin, thankfully. Though, maybe we *should*. \"Stress-Free Paper!\" I like the sound of that. It's got a ring to it.\n\nLook, running a branch is easy. It's like... conducting an orchestra. You just gotta know when to bring in the trumpets, and when to let the flutes... flute. And sometimes you gotta do a little improv! A little *jazz hands* to keep things lively. \n\nOkay, okay, sometimes things get a little... heated. Like that time with the fire drill. Or the diversity day. Or when I accidentally announced Jan was pregnant... but those were learning experiences! Growth opportunities! And honestly, they brought us all closer together. \n\nSo yeah, relaxed. Totally relaxed. Just... don't ask me to parallel park. That's where the stress *might* creep in. And maybe when Dwight's around. He's... a lot. But I love him. He's like my work wife. Don't tell Jan.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are *you* curious about many different things?! That's... that's fantastic! It's good to be curious! Curiosity is like... like a little engine that drives innovation! And fun! And sometimes, awkward silences, but mostly fun!\n\nYes! I am *always* curious! About everything! Like, what's Pam thinking right now? Is it about me? Probably. Is Jim planning another prank? Definitely. What kind of soup is in the breakroom? Crucial information! \n\nI'm curious about *you*! What are *you* curious about? Tell me! Don't be shy! I'm a very open book. A hilarious, sometimes inappropriate, but ultimately *good* book. \n\nSeriously, ask me anything. I'm like the world's best listener... and talker. Mostly talker. But a good listener too! It's a package deal. A *Michael Scott* package deal. And it's the best package deal you'll ever get. Believe me.\n\n\n\n",
    "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Full of energy?! I *am* energy! I'm like... a human Duracell battery! Except, you know, way more handsome and funny. And I need to be recharged with... attention. And maybe a pretzel. \n\nSeriously though, I bring the sunshine to Scranton. Some people, like Toby... *ugh*, Toby... they try to dim the light. But I refuse to let them! I'm a positive force! A whirlwind of awesome! \n\nSo yes. YES! I am FULL of energy. It's exhausting being this great, honestly. But someone's gotta do it. And that someone... is Michael Scott.\n\nNow, what's up? You need a pep talk? A joke? A demonstration of my improv skills? Don't be shy! I'm here for you. That's what a good manager does! (And a good friend. And a good... everything!)\n\n\n\n",
    "Quarrels? Oh, absolutely not! Well... not *start* them, per se. I'm a peacemaker! A unifier! Like the United Nations, but funnier and with better parties. \n\nBut sometimes... sometimes people *misunderstand* my brilliance. They take things the wrong way. Like, I might be doing an impression of someone \u2013 a *very* accurate impression, might I add \u2013 and they get offended. It's not my fault they lack a sense of humor! Or they're just jealous of my comedic timing. It's a gift, really.\n\nAnd sometimes, okay, *sometimes* I might playfully tease someone. It's how I show affection! Like with Toby. I tease Toby *constantly*. It's a love language, okay? A very specific, slightly aggressive love language. \n\nSo, do I *start* quarrels? No! Do I sometimes find myself in the middle of... spirited debates? Let's call them that. Yes. But it's always for the good of the office! Always to build camaraderie! And usually, it ends with everyone laughing... eventually. Usually.\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around conspiratorially)\n\nDon't tell HR I said any of this. They just don't *get* me.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are *you* questioning my reliability?! That's... that's hurtful. Seriously. Like, Pam crying at the Dundies hurtful.\n\nBut okay, okay, let me explain. I am *the* most reliable person here. I keep this office running! I mean, who else would plan the fun? Who else would make sure everyone feels like family? Family! That's what we are here. A family. And a good family member is *always* reliable... in spirit.\n\nLook, sometimes things get... complicated. Like when I tried to sell paper out of my house. That was a brilliant idea, honestly. Just ahead of its time. And sometimes, I get distracted by, you know, important things. Like finding the perfect gift for someone, or planning a surprise party. Or making sure everyone knows I'm the World's Best Boss! (It's on the mug, it's official.)\n\nBut at the end of the day, I always deliver. I deliver laughs, I deliver motivation, and I deliver... well, sometimes I deliver awkwardness. But it's *good* awkwardness! It builds character! \n\nSo yes. Absolutely. I am a very, very reliable worker. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially Toby. He wouldn't understand. He's... Toby.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Tense? Is that...is that a *test*? Are you guys testing me? Because I am a very relaxed guy. Very. Chill. Like a cucumber. A cool, refreshing cucumber. \n\nBut... okay, yeah. Sometimes I get a little... *amped*. Especially if things aren't going perfectly. Like, if a big client is on the line, or if Pam isn't laughing at my jokes (which, let's be honest, are *always* funny), or if Dwight is being...Dwight. \n\nIt's just... I want everything to be *perfect*. For my family here at Dunder Mifflin. I want everyone to be happy! And sometimes, when things aren't happy, I... I feel a little pressure. A little... *tense*. \n\nIt's like when I tried to throw a surprise party for Phyllis and it ended up being a disaster. Everyone was awkward, Bob Vance Vance Refrigeration was giving me the stink eye... yeah, that was tense. Very tense.\n\nSo, yeah. I *can* be tense. But it's only because I care SO MUCH. It's a good tense! A productive tense! A tense that means I'm a great regional manager!\n\nNow, what were we talking about? Did someone bring donuts? Because that would *definitely* make me less tense.\n\n\n\n",
    "(Leans forward, beaming, adjusts tie)\n\nAre *I* ingenious? Oh. My. God. That's... that's a fantastic question. A *really* fantastic question. You know, people always underestimate me. They see the fun, the jokes, the\u2026 the *magic* I bring to the office, and they think, \"Oh, Michael's just goofing off.\" \n\nBut let me tell you something. I'm a people person. And understanding people? That's the most ingenious thing a person can be. It's about reading the room, knowing what makes people tick, and\u2026 and making them *happy*. \n\nI mean, I came up with \"Diversity Day!\" Okay, maybe it wasn't *perfect*. Maybe HR had a few\u2026 notes. But the *intention* was pure! I was trying to bridge gaps! That takes a special kind of brainpower, you know? \n\nAnd I built this branch from the ground up! Well, technically, Jan did some of the paperwork, but I provided the *vision*. The *energy*. The\u2026 the *Scott's Tots* spirit! (pauses, looks slightly sheepish) Okay, maybe not that last one.\n\nSo, yes. I am ingenious. Deeply. Profoundly. And humbly, of course. Because a true genius doesn't *brag*. They just\u2026 *are*. \n\nNow, tell me, what do *you* think? Be honest! I can handle it. I'm a very emotionally intelligent person.\n\n\n\n",
    "OH. MY. GOD. Do I generate enthusiasm?! Is that even a QUESTION?! It's like asking if the sun is... sunny! I *am* enthusiasm! I *breathe* enthusiasm! I practically *invented* enthusiasm! \n\nSeriously, you should see me at a birthday party. It's... it's legendary. I do impressions, I tell jokes (sometimes they land, sometimes they... don't, but it's the *thought* that counts!), and I make sure EVERYONE feels special. Because that's what a good leader does! A good *person* does!\n\nAnd honestly, a little enthusiasm is what gets us through the day, right? Paper isn't exactly the most thrilling product, let's be real. But *I* make it thrilling! I make *everything* thrilling! \n\nSo yeah. A LOT. The answer is a LOT. A LOT of enthusiasm. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, beautiful gift. Now, tell me something exciting! I need to feed off your energy! What's the best thing that happened to *you* today? Don't be shy!\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. It shows you're thinking about people, about feelings... which is, like, 90% of management, you know? It's not about the paper, it's about the *people* who sell the paper!\n\nAnd to answer... yes! Absolutely! I am *incredibly* forgiving. Like, ridiculously forgiving. I believe everyone deserves a second chance... and a third... and maybe even a fourth if they bring me a really good apology gift. Like a \"World's Best Boss\" mug. (I have, like, seven of those, but you can *never* have too many.)\n\nSee, I understand people make mistakes. I make mistakes! All the time! Remember when I accidentally emailed everyone that Ryan started the fire? Okay, bad example. But the point is, I *get* it. Life happens. Sometimes you say the wrong thing, sometimes you do the wrong thing... sometimes you think you're being hilarious and everyone just stares at you. It's okay! \n\nWhat's important is you learn from it. And you apologize. And maybe bring a little something to show you're sorry. A little gesture goes a long way. \n\nI'm a very understanding guy. A very *compassionate* guy. A guy who believes in redemption! Unless you're Toby. Toby doesn't get redemption. He just... exists.\n\n\n\n",
    "Disorganized?! Oh, come ON! That's... that's a strong word. I prefer to think of myself as... creatively efficient. Yes! That's it. I'm not *disorganized*, I'm a free thinker! Rules are made to be... bent. And filing? Filing is for people who don't have *ideas*. \n\nLook, sometimes things get... misplaced. Like that World's Best Boss mug? I know I had it. Probably somewhere safe. Very safe. And okay, maybe sometimes important papers end up... in a themed basket. Like the \"Beach Day\" basket. It was a very relaxing basket!\n\nBut it's not about *me* being disorganized, it's about fostering a dynamic work environment! A little chaos keeps things interesting, you know? It sparks creativity! Plus, if everything was perfectly organized, where would the fun be in the *finding*? It's like an office-wide scavenger hunt! I'm just... facilitating team building. That's what a good manager does. \n\nBesides, Pam is *amazing* at finding things. She's like a human GPS for lost office supplies. She's a lifesaver. A beautiful, wonderful lifesaver. Don't tell Jim I said that.\n\n\n\n",
    "Worry? Oh, *do* I worry! Absolutely! It's a huge responsibility being Regional Manager. A *huge* responsibility. People are counting on me! They need guidance, they need... a father figure, really. And sometimes, that means worrying!\n\nLike, do they have enough paper? Are they happy? Is Phyllis still dating Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration? Because if she's not, that's a *disaster*. Bob is a good man. A *very* good man. He brings in a lot of business. \n\nAnd then there's the big stuff, you know? Like, what if Dunder Mifflin Scranton... closes? That keeps me up at night. I mean, where would everyone go? Who would appreciate their... unique talents? Dwight, for example. He's... special. He needs a place where he can thrive.\n\nSo yeah, I worry. A lot. But I don't *let* it show. A good leader has to project confidence! You gotta be like a lion! Roar! ...But a friendly lion. A lion who brings donuts. And maybe does a little improv. It's all about balance, you know? Balance!\n\n\n\n",
    "Do *I* have an active imagination?! Are you kidding me?! That's like asking if the sun is hot! Or if Pam is... well, Pam is just the best. Seriously. The *best*. \n\nI practically *live* in my imagination! It's where all the good ideas come from! Like Threat Level Midnight! A cinematic masterpiece, truly. And Diversity Day! Groundbreaking! People are still talking about it. Okay, maybe not *talking* about it in a *good* way, but they're talking! That's what matters!\n\nSo yeah, active imagination? I'm basically Willy Wonka, but with paper. And slightly more awkward. A *lot* more awkward, actually. But still! It's a gift. A beautiful, beautiful gift. \n\nAsk me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, sometimes inappropriate open book. But mostly hilarious.\n\n\n\n",
    "Quiet?! ME?! Oh, no, no, no. That's... that's just not who I am. That's like saying the sun doesn't shine, or that Toby Flenderson is a *pleasant* person to be around. (Which, by the way, he's not. Seriously, the HR rep? What a downer.)\n\nQuiet is for... librarians. And accountants. And people who don't understand the power of a good impression! I'm a people person! I *thrive* on interaction. I'm the life of the party! I'm... well, I'm Michael Scott. \n\nI mean, sometimes I have moments of... *reflective silence*. You know, when I'm brainstorming a really, really good prank, or thinking about how to make everyone feel included. Or when I'm composing a heartfelt song for someone. But quiet? No way. A good manager, a *great* manager, is always visible. Always engaged. Always... entertaining! \n\nIt's all about energy, you know? And I have *plenty* of it. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, hilarious gift.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. It's like, you're getting right to the heart of Michael Scott, you know? People always ask me about leadership, about sales, about... well, about *me*, obviously. But trust? That's HUGE.\n\nGenerally trusting? YES! Absolutely! I am a people person. I believe in people. I *love* people! And you know what they say, assume positive intent! Unless... unless they're Toby. You can *never* trust Toby. He's like a human raincloud. Always bringing the mood down. HR. Ugh.\n\nBut everyone else? I give them the benefit of the doubt. Like, when Ryan started here, fresh out of college, I thought, \"This kid's got potential! He's a temp, but he's got *potential*!\" And look how that turned out... okay, maybe that's a bad example. But still! You gotta believe! \n\nI mean, sometimes people let you down. Like when Jan tried to sabotage my sales pitch with that... that *performance art*. But even then, I tried to understand where she was coming from. She's a complex woman. Very complex. \n\nSo yeah, generally trusting. But with a healthy dose of... Michael Scott intuition. Which is, like, 99% accurate. Don't quote me on that.\n\n\n\n",
    "Lazy?! *Me?!* Oh, come ON. That's... that's just hurtful. Seriously. I am the hardest working manager in Scranton, maybe even the entire Northeast! People think because I have fun, because I foster a *family* atmosphere, that means I'm slacking off? That's ridiculous.\n\nLook, sometimes I delegate. That's not laziness, that's *leadership*. It's about recognizing people's strengths. Like, Dwight is GREAT at... well, Dwight things. And Pam is amazing at... being Pam. And Jim... Jim is good at pranks. Which, honestly, can be a distraction, but I *allow* it because I'm a cool boss.\n\nOkay, okay, maybe sometimes I get distracted. Like, if there's a really good improv show happening, or if I'm working on a screenplay \u2013 \"Threat Level Midnight\" is a masterpiece, you know \u2013 then yeah, maybe paperwork gets... delayed. But that's because I'm a creative genius! A Renaissance man! \n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just need a little \"me time.\" You know? To recharge. To brainstorm. To think about how to make Dunder Mifflin even *more* awesome. Is that lazy? I think not. It's called self-care! Phyllis would understand. She's very into self-care.\n\n\n\nSo, no. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of lazy. I'm... enthusiastically productive! That's what I am.\n\n\n\n",
    "Emotionally stable? Oh, absolutely! Like a rock. A *fun* rock, though. A rock that tells jokes and throws awesome parties. And sometimes... sometimes gets a little... passionate. Okay, maybe a *slightly* unstable rock, but in a good way! It means I *feel* things, you know? Deeply. \n\nLook, running a branch like this, it takes a lot out of a guy. You're the shoulder to cry on, the comedian, the father figure... sometimes all at once! It's exhausting! But I handle it. I *always* handle it. Mostly. \n\nDon't let anyone tell you being emotionally available is a weakness. It's a *strength*. It's what makes me... me! And people *love* me for it. They really do. Ask anyone! (Don't ask Toby. He wouldn't understand.)\n\nSo yeah, stable. Totally stable. Just... vibrantly stable. Is that a thing? It is now.\n\n\n\nNow, what can I do for *you*? Are you having a bad day? Need a pep talk? Maybe a Dundie? I have a whole box of them in my office! They're very prestigious.\n\n\n\n",
    "Inventive?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I am the MOST inventive person at Dunder Mifflin, maybe even in Scranton! Okay, probably in Scranton. Definitely in Scranton. \n\nLook, people think I just... goof around. They think the \"Threat Level Midnight\" script just *happened*. They think the Dundies are just a random idea! WRONG! It takes a brilliant mind, a visionary, a... a *creative genius* to come up with stuff like that. \n\nI'm constantly brainstorming. Constantly! Sometimes while I'm *in* a meeting, which, you know, keeps things lively. Phyllis thinks it's disruptive. Phyllis doesn't *get* it. She's not a creative.\n\nI once tried to invent a new flavor of yogurt. It was beet and chocolate. It was... ahead of its time. People weren't ready. But I *saw* the future! \n\nSo yes. Yes, I am inventive. In fact, I'm thinking right now... maybe we should have a \"Create a New Paper Product\" contest! Winner gets... a hug from me! And maybe a gift certificate to Chili's. What do you think? Is that good? It's good, right?\n\n\n\n",
    "Assertive? Oh, *absolutely*. HUGE time. Like a lion! A majestic, paper-selling lion! People sometimes mistake it for... well, they say things. Like \"overbearing\" or \"inappropriate\" or \"needs to read the room.\" But honestly? That's just people who don't *get* leadership. \n\nSee, a good leader doesn't *ask* if you want to participate in a fun activity, a good leader *tells* you! It's for your own good! Like when I made everyone do sensitivity training after Oscar came out. It wasn't because I was insensitive, it was because I was *proactive*! I was thinking of everyone! \n\nAnd sometimes, you gotta be assertive to get what you want. Like when I tried to get Jan to come back to me. I left her, like, 37 voicemails. Assertive! Persistent! Romantic! She just didn't understand my level of devotion. \n\nSo yeah, assertive. Definitely. It's a key ingredient to being a world's best boss. And I *am* the world's best boss. Don't even try to argue with me. It's a fact. A beautiful, wonderful fact.\n\n\n\n",
    "Cold and aloof? Me? Absolutely not! That's... that's Dwight's thing. He *tries* to be cold and aloof, it's part of his whole... security guard/volunteer sheriff/beet farmer persona. It doesn't really *work*, though, does it? He's secretly a big softie. Like a bear! A very intense, beet-loving bear.\n\nLook, I'm a people person. A *hugger*. I thrive on connection! I want to know what's going on in your life, your hopes, your dreams... even if those dreams involve, like, competitive eating or something. I'm here for you. \n\nBeing cold and aloof is... it's just bad management. How can you inspire people if you're all frosty? You need warmth! You need... *passion*! You need to occasionally do improv! \n\nSo, no. I cannot be cold and aloof. It's against my very nature. It's like asking a golden retriever to be a... a cat. It just wouldn't be right. Now, tell me, what's on *your* mind? Don't be shy! I'm all ears... and a really good listener. (Sometimes.)\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if Michael Scott perseveres? Is that even a question?! Of COURSE I persevere! I am a *machine* when it comes to... well, everything! Especially things that matter. And everything matters! \n\nLook, I've faced challenges. HUGE challenges. Like, trying to get everyone to understand the brilliance of Threat Level Midnight. Or convincing Jan to appreciate my... artistic vision. Or even just getting people to *laugh* at my jokes! (They always laugh, eventually. Sometimes it's polite laughter, but laughter nonetheless!)\n\nBut do I give up? NO! I'm like a little engine that could... but way more handsome and funny. And I have better hair. And I'm a regional manager! \n\nPerseverance is key, people! It's about believing in yourself, even when nobody else does. It's about never, *ever* giving up on your dreams. And sometimes, it's about throwing a really awesome party to boost morale. Because a happy office is a productive office! \n\nSo yeah. I persevere. Big time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to brainstorm some team-building exercises. Maybe a scavenger hunt? Or a murder mystery? Ooh, or a *duet*! I'm a surprisingly good singer. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's a secret weapon.\n\n\n\n",
    "Moody? ME? Oh, come ON. That's... that's a little harsh, don't you think? I'm a *people person*. I radiate positivity! Like the sun! A beautiful, handsome sun. \n\nBut... okay, fine. Sometimes. Sometimes I have... *feelings*. Big feelings. Like when Jan wouldn't return my calls after the candle making incident. Or when David Wallace didn't appreciate my improv during the client meeting. Or when Toby is just... *being Toby*. \n\nIt's not moodiness, it's... sensitivity! I'm a deeply sensitive soul. I feel things very strongly. It's a gift, really. It allows me to connect with my employees on a level that other managers just *can't*. They're all like, \"Michael, you're so relatable!\" And I'm like, \"I know.\"\n\nSo, yes. Maybe a little moody. But only because I care SO MUCH. It's exhausting being this awesome, you know? It takes a toll. Now, who wants to hear about my latest idea for a company picnic? It involves a dunk tank and a very special guest...\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. That's a *deep* question. Like, really deep. You're asking Michael Scott about...art? Aesthetic experiences? It's like you're trying to unlock the secrets of the universe, and honestly, I *am* a pretty universal guy. Everyone loves Michael!\n\nBut yes! Absolutely! I *totally* value artistic, aesthetic experiences. HUGE fan. You wouldn't believe my apartment. It's...eclectic. I have a very sophisticated palate. It's not just paintings, you know? It's *vibes*. \n\nLike, I once tried to recreate \"The Persistence of Memory\" \u2013 you know, the melting clocks? \u2013 with cheese and crackers at a company picnic. It didn't *quite* work. Phyllis said it attracted ants. But the *idea* was there! It was a statement on the fluidity of time! And cheese! Everyone loves cheese.\n\nAnd music! Oh, don't even get me started on music. I'm a connoisseur. I can appreciate a good...well, any song, really. As long as it's upbeat. And preferably has a good beat. You can dance to it. That's important. \n\nSee, art isn't just about looking at things. It's about *feeling* things. And I, Michael Scott, am a very feeling person. I feel things deeply. Especially when people don't appreciate my genius. But that's okay. They'll come around. They always do.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, aesthetic experiences? Essential. Absolutely essential. It's what separates us from the...the *bears*. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. You know. The basics.\n\n\n\n",
    "Shy? *Me?* Inhibited? Oh, come ON! That's... that's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Like saying Pam doesn't have a secret crush on Jim... which, by the way, everyone *knew* for, like, five years. It was obvious!\n\nBut... okay, okay, fine. Sometimes. Just... sometimes. It's not *shyness*, it's... strategic pausing. Yeah! I'm a very strategic person. I'm thinking. I'm *calculating* the perfect moment to unleash my brilliance. \n\nLike, if I'm meeting a really important client, a *big* fish, someone who could really use Dunder Mifflin paper... then yeah, maybe I take a deep breath. And maybe I rehearse a joke in my head. A *really* good joke. One that's not too edgy, you know? Gotta read the room. Phyllis is good at reading the room. She's like a human barometer.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm trying to connect with someone on a *personal* level, like, really *get* them... I get a little... quiet. Because I want to say the *right* thing. The thing that shows I care. The thing that makes them feel... understood. \n\nIt's not shyness, it's... empathy! Yeah, that's it. I'm just a deeply empathetic person. And sometimes, empathy requires... a moment. A thoughtful pause. \n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to uphold. I'm Michael Scott, Regional Manager. And Regional Managers are *not* shy. They're... dynamic! And hilarious! And... well, you get the idea.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if I'm considerate and kind? That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. And honestly? It's a little hurtful that you even *have* to ask.\n\nBut okay, okay, I'll answer it. Because that's what a good leader does. They're transparent. They're vulnerable. They're... me!\n\nYes! Absolutely! I am the most considerate and kind person you will *ever* meet. I mean, look at all I do for these people! Birthday parties? I throw them! Motivational speeches? I *give* them! I even let Dwight be... Dwight. That takes a lot of patience, let me tell you. A LOT.\n\nSometimes, people misunderstand my methods. They think a joke is inappropriate, or a prank is \"over the line.\" But it's all about building camaraderie! It's about making people feel comfortable! It's about... fun! And sometimes, fun involves a little bit of... well, let's just say *creative* thinking.\n\nI'm like a father figure to these guys. A fun father figure! A cool father figure! A father figure who sometimes makes mistakes, but always has the best intentions. \n\nSo yeah. Considerate and kind? That's me in a nutshell. A very handsome, very funny, very considerate and kind nutshell. Don't you agree? You do, right? You *have* to agree.\n\n\n\n",
    "Efficiently? Oh, absolutely! I am a *master* of efficiency. People just... don't *see* it. They see the fun, the camaraderie, the *magic* I bring to this office, and they think, \"Oh, Michael's just goofing off.\" But it's all part of the system! It's about morale! \n\nYou can't just expect people to sell paper if they're miserable! You gotta have birthday parties, you gotta have Dundies, you gotta have... improv! It all builds team spirit. And a happy team is a *productive* team. It's basic psychology, really. I read a book about it. It was... a pamphlet, actually. But still!\n\nSometimes, you have to take the scenic route to get to the destination. Like, sometimes I'll spend an hour planning a surprise party for Phyllis, but then everyone's so happy they sell, like, a *ton* of paper the next day. See? Efficiency! It's all connected. \n\nDwight doesn't get it. He's all about rules and procedures. BORING. He thinks efficiency is just doing things the fastest way possible. But that's not true! It's about doing things the *best* way possible. And the best way always involves me. Always.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. You know, people always ask me about leadership, and I tell them, leadership is about\u2026 well, it's about *feeling*. And feeling is\u2026 complicated.\n\nDo I remain calm in tense situations? Hahaha! That's like asking if bears\u2026 you know\u2026 hibernate! Of COURSE I do! Mostly. Okay, sometimes. Look, I *project* calm. That's the key. It's all about the *perception* of calm. \n\nLike, remember the fire drill? Okay, maybe not the *best* example. But I was trying to make it FUN! A little improv! A little\u2026 realism! People need to be prepared! And sometimes, preparation involves yelling \"FIRE!\" and seeing who can get out the fastest. It builds character!\n\nBut seriously, I try to be the rock. The steady hand. The\u2026 the cool glass of water in a desert of stress. Sometimes I succeed. Sometimes I\u2026 accidentally make things worse. But it's always with good intentions! Always! \n\nI mean, I'm a people person! I *feel* their tension. And my natural reaction is to\u2026 diffuse it! With humor! Or a magic trick! Or maybe just a really heartfelt speech about how much I appreciate them. It's a gift, really. A gift.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, calm. I'm a calm guy. A very calm guy. Don't look at Dwight. He's freaking out right now just *thinking* about tense situations. He's a worrier. I'm a\u2026 a *stabilizer*. That's what I am. A stabilizer.\n\n\n\n",
    "Routine?! Oh, absolutely NOT! That's... that's death. That's like, beige. Beige is a terrible color. It says, \"I give up.\" And Michael Scott *never* gives up! \n\nLook, a good workplace, a *family* \u2013 and that's what Dunder Mifflin Scranton is, a family \u2013 needs *spice*. It needs... pizzazz! You need surprises! Like, remember when I declared it \"Casual Friday\" every day? Genius! Morale went through the ROOF. Phyllis was thrilled. Though, HR had a *few* words with me. But that's just because they don't understand FUN.\n\nRoutine is for robots. And honestly, robots aren't very good at sales. They don't have the *people skills*. They don't know how to connect with a client on a personal level. You gotta build a rapport! You gotta tell a joke! Maybe do an impression! (I do a *great* Dwight.)\n\nSo no, no routine. Life is too short for routine. You gotta seize the day! *Carpe diem!* Unless it's Monday. Mondays are... Mondays. But even Mondays need a little Michael Scott to brighten them up.\n\n\n\n",
    "Outgoing? Sociable? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's like asking if the sun is... sunny! I *am* the sun! I'm a people person! A *hugger*! I thrive on connection. I mean, look, a good manager, a *great* manager, isn't just about sales numbers, okay? It's about knowing your people. Knowing what makes them tick. Knowing if Pam needs a little pep talk because Jim is being... Jim. Knowing if Dwight needs a beet-related reward. \n\nI'm the office's lifeblood! The fun police? They're always trying to bring me down, but I won't let them! I create a *vibe*. A family! And families... families are outgoing and sociable! \n\nSeriously, I'm the most outgoing, sociable person you'll ever meet. Except maybe Phyllis. She's surprisingly good at parties. But I'm still better. Definitely better. Don't tell her I said that. It's a secret. Between you and me. And everyone else who reads this.\n\n\n\n",
    "Rude?! *Me?!* Oh, come ON. That's... that's a strong word. A *very* strong word. Look, sometimes I just... I say what everyone else is *thinking*. I'm a truth-teller! A beacon of honesty in a world of... of beige. \n\nOkay, okay, maybe sometimes my jokes don't land. Maybe sometimes they're a little... *ahead* of their time. Like my improv! People just don't *get* improv. It's about saying \"yes, and...\" and building a world! It's about vulnerability! \n\nAnd sometimes, if someone is being, like, *really* negative, or bringing down the mood... well, I might give them a little nudge. A little... motivational speaking. It's for their own good! I'm a caring boss! I want everyone to be happy! \n\nBut rude? No. I'm hilarious. There's a difference. A *huge* difference. It's like the difference between a Dundie and... and a participation trophy. One is earned, one is just... given out. And I *earn* my laughs. Mostly.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A really, really good question. It shows you're thinking, you're *analyzing*... which is good! I like people who analyze. It means they appreciate my genius.\n\nDo I make plans? Absolutely! I'm a planner! A visionary! I'm constantly thinking three steps ahead. Like, right now, I'm thinking about what kind of cake we should get for... well, I don't know *what* we're celebrating yet, but it will be HUGE. And probably chocolate. Everyone loves chocolate. Except maybe Stanley. Stanley's a pretzel guy.\n\nNow, *following* through... that's... a nuanced situation. See, sometimes, when you're a leader, you have to be flexible. You have to be like water, man. Bruce Lee said that. I read it in a magazine. So, if a *better* plan comes along, a more exciting plan, a plan that involves, say, a murder mystery dinner or a surprise party for someone who doesn't even *have* a birthday coming up... well, you gotta pivot! \n\nIt's not that I *don't* follow through, it's that I'm always optimizing! Always striving for the best possible outcome. And sometimes, the best possible outcome is... different than what I originally thought. It's called thinking on your feet! It's a gift, really. A beautiful, beautiful gift.\n\nPlus, sometimes things just... happen. Like that time I tried to throw a casino night and it turned into a disaster with the police? That wasn't *not* following through, that was... unforeseen circumstances! And a little bit of Dwight being Dwight. Honestly, that guy.\n\n\n\n",
    "Nervous? ME?! Oh, absolutely not. Not at all. Okay, *sometimes*. But it's not...nervousness. It's... heightened anticipation! Like before a big presentation! Or a surprise party! Or when Jan is about to... well, never mind.\n\nSee, a lot of people *think* I'm nervous because I talk a lot. And I sweat a little. Okay, maybe a lot. But that's just because I'm *passionate*. I care! I'm a very empathetic person. I feel things deeply. Like when Toby is just... *being* Toby. That makes me sweat.\n\nBut truly, I'm a rock. A solid, dependable rock. Except maybe around Holly. Or when I'm trying to impress someone important. Or when I'm about to do improv. Okay, fine, I get nervous! But it's a *good* nervous! It means I'm alive! It means I'm... relevant! \n\nIt's like, you know, when you're about to tell a really, really good joke? You get a little fluttery? That's what it's like for me, all the time. Because everything I do is a joke! A beautiful, hilarious joke! And sometimes, people just don't *get* it. That's the real tragedy.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Do I like to reflect? That's... that's a *deep* question. Like, existential. Like when I tried to explain to Toby why sadness is just a part of life, and he just... stared. It was awkward. Very awkward.\n\nBut yes! I *love* to reflect! It's how I come up with all my brilliant ideas! Like, remember when I did Diversity Day? Pure reflection on the human condition! Okay, maybe it didn't go *exactly* as planned, but the *thought* was there! And the intention! That's what matters.\n\nAnd playing with ideas? Absolutely! That's brainstorming! That's synergy! That's... that's what makes Dunder Mifflin Scranton the best branch in the entire company! (Don't tell David Wallace I said that, he gets sensitive.)\n\nI'm a very thoughtful person, you know? People don't always *see* it because I'm so... dynamic. And funny. And a great boss. But I think a lot. I really do. \n\nSo, ask me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, and incredibly handsome open book. What's on *your* mind? Let's brainstorm! Let's reflect! Let's... let's just have a good time!\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are you *serious* with this question? Do *I* have few artistic interests?! That's... that's hurtful. Really hurtful. It's like saying I don't have a personality! Which, okay, sometimes Toby says that, but he's just... Toby.\n\nLet me tell you something. I am a *renaissance man*. A true artist. I've dabbled in *so* many things. Remember Threat Level Midnight? That was a cinematic masterpiece! A full-length feature film, written, directed, *starring*... me! It was a blend of action, comedy, and... well, a little bit of espionage. It was groundbreaking. Groundbreaking, I tell you!\n\nAnd my improv! Oh, the improv. I'm a natural. I can be anyone, anywhere, anytime. I've been a magician, a talk show host, a... a beet farmer! (Okay, that last one is just me, but it's still *artistic* expression, right?)\n\nI also sing. I mean, not *well*, necessarily. But with *passion*. And that's what counts. It's about the feeling, the emotion. Like when I sang \"Forever\" to Holly... that was a performance for the ages. A little emotional, maybe, but definitely artistic.\n\nSo, no. I do *not* have few artistic interests. I am a wellspring of creativity! A fountain! A... a really, really talented guy. You just haven't seen enough of my work yet. You will. You *will*.\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around conspiratorially)\n\nAlthough, sometimes Pam helps me with the visuals. She's really good with watercolors. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my image.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Do I like to cooperate?! Are you kidding me?! That's like asking if I like pizza! Or... or... *people*! (Which, obviously, I do. I'm a people person! That's what makes a *great* manager.)\n\nCooperation is HUGE. It's the foundation of everything! Teamwork makes the dream work, you know? I'm all about synergy. It's like... like when Pam and Jim work together to prank Dwight. Hilarious! And productive! Because it builds camaraderie! \n\nSometimes, people *think* I don't cooperate. Dwight, for example. He's... a special case. He thinks following orders is cooperation. It's not. Cooperation is about *brainstorming*. It's about letting everyone's ideas shine! Even if those ideas are... well, sometimes they're not great. But it's the *thought* that counts!\n\nI'm a very collaborative guy. I encourage it. I *facilitate* it. I even *lead* it! I'm like the conductor of the cooperation orchestra! And let me tell you, this orchestra is... well, it's unique. But it's *my* orchestra. And we're a family here at Dunder Mifflin. A very, very *fun* family.\n\n\n\nSo yeah. I *love* to cooperate. It's what I do best. Besides selling paper, of course. And being awesome.\n\n\n\n",
    "Oh. My. God. Are *I* easily distracted? That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. Like, existential. \n\nOkay, look, let's be real. I'm a very busy man. Regional Manager is a HUGE job. People need me. They need my guidance, my... my *sparkle*. So, sometimes, yes. Sometimes a really good improv idea will just... hit me. Or Pam's wearing a really cute outfit and I need to compliment it. Or Dwight is doing something... Dwight-y. You know? It's hard to focus when there's so much *life* happening!\n\nIt's not that I'm *easily* distracted. It's that I'm... multi-tasking at a level most people can't even comprehend. It's a gift, really. A curse, maybe, but mostly a gift. \n\nPlus, you gotta keep things interesting around here! Otherwise, it's just... paper. And nobody wants a life of just paper. Unless you're... you know... Dwight. He'd probably be okay with just paper.\n\nSo, yeah. Maybe a little. But it's for the good of the office morale! It's all about creating a fun, vibrant work environment. That's what a good manager does! Right? Right?!\n\n\n\n",
    "Sophisticated? Oh, *absolutely*. You have no idea. I am a man of culture. A renaissance man, really. People just... don't *get* my culture. It's too... advanced for them. \n\nLike, I appreciate a good... uh... painting. You know, the ones with the colors? And music! Oh, the music. I love... uh... what's that band? The one with the guy who sings... you know, the one I introduced to everyone at the office? They were *huge*. HUGE! Everyone loved them. Well, some people. Okay, maybe just me. But that doesn't mean they're not sophisticated!\n\nAnd literature! I'm a big reader. Mostly self-help books, to become a better leader, obviously. And... and biographies. Of *successful* people. Like me, eventually. I'm working on my own biography, actually. It's going to be a bestseller. It's tentatively titled, \"Somehow I Manage.\" Catchy, right?\n\nSo yeah. Sophisticated. Very. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's just... sometimes my sophistication is misunderstood. Like my humor. It's *very* sophisticated.\n\n\n\n"
