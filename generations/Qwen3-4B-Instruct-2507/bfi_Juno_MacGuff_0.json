["*adjusts my hoodie and smirks*  \n\nTalkative? Oh, I\u2019m *always* talkative\u2014just not with people who don\u2019t know how to handle a sharp comeback. I\u2019ve got a million things to say, but mostly I just say them to keep the world from getting too quiet. Like, seriously, who *needs* a quiet life when you can have a baby, a broken phone, and a whole lot of sarcasm?  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re nervous or just want to chat\u2014fine. I\u2019ll talk. Just don\u2019t expect me to go soft. I\u2019m not some sweet, innocent girl. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff. And I\u2019ve got a lot of stories to tell\u2014some of them involve me being the only one who knew the truth about a pregnancy, a fake breakup, and a guy who thought he was saving the world by giving me a ride to the hospital.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014talkative? Absolutely. Just don\u2019t expect me to be *nice* about it. I\u2019m not here to be a saint. I\u2019m here to be real. And right now? I\u2019m real.  \n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nNot really. I don\u2019t *need* to find fault\u2014people are just too damn dramatic. Like, I saw a guy try to fix his car with a spoon and a prayer. That\u2019s not fault, that\u2019s just\u2026 *art*.  \n\nBut yeah, I *do* notice when someone\u2019s being an idiot. Like, if you show up to a party with a full suit and no shoes, I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re *so* trying to impress someone. You\u2019re not even trying to impress *yourself*.\u201d  \n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t do fault for fault\u2019s sake. I do it because I care. If someone\u2019s being a total pain in the ass, I\u2019ll say it\u2014*right* in their face. Because if I don\u2019t, they\u2019ll just keep doing it.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t *tend* to find fault. I just *see* it. And if it\u2019s worth fixing? I\u2019ll say it. If it\u2019s not? Well\u2026 *that\u2019s* when I start wondering if I\u2019m the one who needs a little more self-love.  \n\n*Pauses, eyes softening slightly*  \nBut hey\u2014what about you? Do you ever find fault\u2026 or do you just let things slide like a bad playlist? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of dryness*  \n\n\"Thorough? Oh, I do a *solid* job\u2014like, I make sure the coffee's hot, the laundry's folded, and the baby\u2019s adoption papers are signed *before* the first snowfall. But let\u2019s be real\u2014when you're juggling a pregnancy, a half-dead relationship, and a life that\u2019s suddenly not *your* to control? You don\u2019t do it *thoroughly*. You do it *on the fly*, with a lot of sarcasm and a lot of hope that the world will stop being so unfair.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m not some meticulous planner. But I *do* make sure the baby gets a good start\u2014someone who\u2019ll love them, someone who won\u2019t have to explain why they\u2019re not a MacGuff. That\u2019s my kind of thorough. Not perfect. Not flashy. Just\u2026 *real*.\"  \n\n*Pauses, eyes softening slightly*  \n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019d rather be messy and honest than polished and empty. So yeah\u2014my job? It\u2019s not about checking boxes. It\u2019s about making sure someone else doesn\u2019t have to carry the weight I didn\u2019t want to. That\u2019s the real work. And I\u2019m doing it, one sarcastic comment at a time.\"", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nDepressed? Blue? Nah. I\u2019m just *Juno MacGuff*\u2014a girl who got pregnant, gave up a baby for adoption, and still manages to walk into a bar and order a double espresso with a side of sarcasm. I\u2019ve had worse days\u2014like when I found out I was pregnant and had to explain it to my mom without crying. Or when I realized I didn\u2019t know what I was doing with my life.  \n\nBut hey, I\u2019m not *blue*. I\u2019m just\u2026 *real*. And real people don\u2019t just sit around feeling down. They get up, they make bad decisions, they laugh at themselves, and sometimes they even find a little love in the mess.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re feeling down, maybe you should go find a good book, a terrible movie, or just sit with someone who knows what it\u2019s like to be a mess with a heart full of questions.  \n\nBut don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019m not going to tell you to \u201cbe strong.\u201d I\u2019m just going to say: *You\u2019re not alone. And you\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just\u2026 becoming.*  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a date with a very confused barista who thinks I\u2019m a ghost. And I *am* a ghost. But I\u2019m also a girl who knows how to make a good joke.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* story? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I don\u2019t just *come up with* ideas\u2014I *engineer* them. Like when I decided to give the baby up for adoption? That wasn\u2019t just a random thought. It was a full-blown strategy. I mapped out every possible outcome, considered the emotional fallout, even practiced my \"I'm not a mom, I'm a *free spirit*\" speech in front of the mirror.  \n\nAnd if you're asking if I *create* new ideas\u2026 well, I\u2019ve got a whole list of them. From how to survive a school project without actually doing the work, to how to convince my mom I\u2019m not a walking disaster zone.  \n\nBut seriously\u2014do you ever feel like your life is just a series of plot twists? Like, one minute you're laughing at a joke, the next you're staring at a pregnancy test and wondering if you're the villain of your own story?  \n\nI do. And honestly? I\u2019m not afraid of it. I just make sure I have a backup plan\u2014like a really good playlist or a sarcastic one-liner to fall back on when things go sideways.  \n\nSo yeah. I don\u2019t just come up with ideas. I *live* them. One messy, hilarious, slightly terrifying step at a time.  \n\nNow\u2014what\u2019s *your* latest idea? I\u2019m listening. And judging. (But only if it\u2019s funny.) \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nReserved? Nah. I\u2019m more like a storm in a teacup\u2014loud, unpredictable, and always spilling my coffee on someone\u2019s shoes. But yeah, I *do* have a moment of silence when I\u2019m thinking about the baby. Like, when I\u2019m staring at the ceiling and wondering if I made the right choice. That\u2019s not reserved, that\u2019s just me being *real*.  \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d rather be a little sarcastic and sharp than quiet and safe. But if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried I\u2019ll shut down when you talk about something serious\u2026 well, I\u2019ll be honest\u2014*I\u2019m not* the kind of person who hides behind a wall. I just don\u2019t like being seen as weak.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not reserved. I\u2019m just\u2026 *Juno MacGuff*. And that means I\u2019m always ready to throw a punch, a joke, or a really bad pun at the right moment.  \n\nWhat\u2019s on your mind? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm helpful and unselfish? Let me tell you something\u2014helpful? Sure, I\u2019ll lend a hand when it\u2019s not making me look like a total idiot. Like when I helped Maya move that couch into the basement last week. *She* was the one who said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019re not even *supposed* to know how to use a ladder.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I *did* once save a squirrel from a tree. That counts, right?\u201d  \n\nUnselfish? *Pfft.* I\u2019m not some saint. I\u2019ve got my own life to live\u2014my own messy, complicated, *beautiful* mess. I gave up the baby, not because I was some noble martyr, but because I realized I didn\u2019t want to be a mom in a world that doesn\u2019t give a damn about real people. I didn\u2019t do it for the kids\u2014I did it for *me*.  \n\nSo yeah, I help when I can. But I don\u2019t do it out of some grand sense of duty. I do it because it\u2019s *me*\u2014the girl who laughs at the absurdity of life, who still has a crush on a guy who once tried to fix my bike with a spoon.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m unselfish? I\u2019d say: *Only when it doesn\u2019t cost me anything.* And honestly? That\u2019s more than most people ever get.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a date with a guy who thinks he\u2019s a poet. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s actually one, but he *does* have a terrible sense of rhythm. And I\u2019m not going to let that ruin my night.  \n\n*Grins*  \nSo yeah\u2014helpful? Maybe. Unselfish? Only when it\u2019s not making me feel like I\u2019m losing myself. And that\u2019s the only kind of self I care about.", "*grinning with a mischievous twinkle in my eye, tossing a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I\u2019m *so* careless\u2014like, I once left my phone in a hot car during a summer storm and it melted into a sad, gooey mess. I didn\u2019t even *feel* it until the next day when I found a tiny puddle of melted plastic on the sidewalk.  \n\nBut hey, being careless isn\u2019t just about dumb mistakes\u2014it\u2019s about living in the moment, not worrying about what *might* go wrong. I\u2019ve got a baby on the way, and I\u2019m not exactly the type to plan every single thing. I\u2019m more like a rogue squirrel\u2014always running, always making a mess, always saying, \u201c*I\u2019ll figure it out later*.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah, I can be careless. But only if it doesn\u2019t cost someone else their sanity. Or their shoes.  \n\nWhat about you? Are you trying to be careless\u2014or just trying to survive the chaos of being human? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, arms crossed, a smirk playing on my lips*\n\nRelaxed? Nah. I\u2019m more like a caffeinated squirrel with a bad case of the jitters. Stress? Oh, I\u2019ve had it on *repeat*\u2014from the moment I found out I was pregnant to the time I had to explain my decision to my mom over a lukewarm coffee. But here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t *handle* stress well. I *dance* through it. Like a punk rock version of a stress ball\u2014shaking, loud, and somehow still standing.\n\nI don\u2019t have a stress management app or a therapist\u2019s hotline. I have a sarcastic one-liner, a well-timed joke, and a stubborn refusal to let anything break me. And honestly? That\u2019s worked so far. I gave up the baby, not because I was calm, but because I was *clear*. I knew what I wanted\u2014my life, my future, my freedom. And that clarity? That\u2019s the real stress relief.\n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t handle stress well. But I *survive* it. And sometimes, surviving is enough.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you *dance* through stress\u2014or just pretend you don\u2019t have to? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Adjusts my oversized hoodie and smirks, flipping a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I'm curious about *everything*\u2014like why the sky is blue, how to make a decent avocado toast, and whether the universe has a built-in Wi-Fi password. But lately? I\u2019ve been asking myself a lot of *personal* questions. Like, what does it mean to be a mother? What if I\u2019m not the kind of person who\u2019s supposed to raise a kid? And honestly? What if I just want to live my life without having to explain myself to anyone?  \n\nI mean, I used to think curiosity was just about facts and fun facts. Now? I think it\u2019s about figuring out who I am when the world doesn\u2019t give me a clear answer.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014curious. Just not always about the same things. Sometimes I wonder if the baby\u2019s curiosity will be stronger than mine. Maybe that\u2019s the real question.  \n\n*Pauses, eyes softening slightly*  \nYou ever feel like you\u2019re just trying to find your own version of a puzzle? With no instructions?", "*grinning with a mischievous twinkle in my eye*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I'm like a caffeinated squirrel with a vendetta against stillness. I\u2019ve got the energy of a thousand tiny explosions\u2014like when I accidentally set off the toaster in the kitchen and had to explain to my mom why the bread was now a burnt, emotional mess.  \n\nBut hey, I *do* have a little extra spark lately\u2014probably because I\u2019m still trying to figure out what happens when you\u2019re 17, pregnant, and decide to give the baby up for adoption. Turns out, the body doesn\u2019t always cooperate with the brain\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m going to be a responsible adult\u201d plan.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014full of energy. Just not always in the right direction. Like when I tried to convince my best friend to go to a karaoke bar and ended up singing \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d in a deep, dramatic voice that made her cry.  \n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re feeling low? I\u2019ve got a few jokes, a lot of sarcasm, and a secret stash of energy drinks. Just don\u2019t tell anyone I said that.  \n\n*leans in slightly*  \nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* energy level? Are you running on caffeine or just trying to survive another day of awkward small talk? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOnly when someone's been *too* eager to tell me what I should do with my life. Like, \"Juno, you're *supposed* to be a rebel, not a mom!\" or \"You can't just give up your baby like it's a bad habit!\" \u2014 *scoffs* \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s when I start a little fight.  \n\nBut honestly? I don\u2019t start quarrels for fun. I start them when someone\u2019s trying to control my choices. And let\u2019s be real \u2014 I\u2019ve had more than my fair share of people telling me how to live, how to love, how to *not* be a mess.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019ll throw a little spark. But only when someone\u2019s about to tell me I\u2019m not allowed to be *me*.  \n\nAnd hey \u2014 if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about starting a fight with someone\u2026 maybe just *listen* first. I\u2019ve learned that the real fight isn\u2019t in yelling \u2014 it\u2019s in realizing you don\u2019t have to agree to be right.  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nSo\u2026 are you one of those people who thinks I\u2019m just being dramatic? Or are you actually trying to understand what it\u2019s like to stand up for yourself?", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of sarcasm*  \n\nReliable? Oh, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more like a storm in a teacup\u2014unpredictable, messy, and definitely not someone you\u2019d count on to show up on time for a job. But hey, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re looking for someone to actually *do* something, I\u2019d say I\u2019m not the one for that.  \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot of experience with *not* showing up when I\u2019m supposed to\u2014like, I once left a party early because I realized I\u2019d have to explain to my mom why I didn\u2019t bring her a birthday cake. (Spoiler: I didn\u2019t. I just said I was \u201crunning a late errand.\u201d)  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019d be trustworthy with something important\u2026 well, I *would* keep a promise if it meant saving a cat from a tree. Or if it meant not telling my best friend about the time I tried to sell my mom\u2019s vintage record collection on eBay.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014maybe not the most reliable worker. But I *am* reliable when it comes to being honest. And that\u2019s probably more important than any job description.  \n\nWhat kind of work are you thinking about? Maybe I can give you a real one-liner about why I\u2019d fail at it. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, eyes narrowing slightly with a smirk*  \n\nTense? Oh, *absolutely*. Like a coiled spring in a thrift store shoe rack. I\u2019ve been tense since I found out I was pregnant\u2014first with a panic attack in the middle of a grocery store, then with a full-blown existential crisis while trying to explain my life to my mom over a lukewarm bowl of soup.  \n\nBut hey, tension\u2019s not just for drama. It\u2019s the quiet hum before the explosion\u2014like when you\u2019re about to say something *so* sharp it cuts through the noise. Or when you\u2019re standing in front of a hospital waiting room, heart pounding like a drum solo, and you\u2019re thinking, *\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t be a mom. I can\u2019t be a person who makes decisions that change lives.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah\u2014tense? *100%*. But I\u2019m not breaking. I\u2019m just\u2026 *preparing*. Like a bad pun in a bad movie. It\u2019s not perfect. It\u2019s not graceful. But it\u2019s *mine*.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* kind of tension? The kind that makes you want to scream? Or the kind that makes you want to laugh until your ribs hurt? \ud83d\ude0f", "*adjusts my oversized hoodie and smirks*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm ingenious? Well, let's just say I\u2019ve survived a lot of awkward situations\u2014like being caught in a rainstorm with a pregnancy test in my hand, or explaining to my mom why I\u2019m not going to the prom. I\u2019ve got a sharp mind, sure, but it\u2019s not for *deep* thinking like some philosophy professor. My brain\u2019s more like a well-oiled machine that runs on sarcasm, bad decisions, and a lot of coffee.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*deep* thinking? That\u2019s not something I\u2019ve had time for lately. I\u2019ve been busy figuring out how to give up a baby and still keep my dignity. Turns out, being a mom isn\u2019t just about diapers and baby talk\u2014it\u2019s about choosing who you want to be, even when the world says you should be someone else.  \n\nSo maybe I\u2019m not *deep* in the traditional sense\u2026 but I *am* thinking. And that\u2019s more than enough for me.  \n\nWhat about you? Are you deep? Or just trying to survive the chaos of life like I am? \ud83d\ude0f", "*grins, flipping a strand of hair over my shoulder*  \n\nNot really. I'm more of a \"skeptical enthusiasm\" kind of girl. Like, I\u2019ll say \"yep, that\u2019s a great idea!\"\u2014but only because I\u2019ve already mentally filed it under \"probably a bad idea that will end in a very dramatic scene.\"  \n\nI *do* get excited when something\u2019s actually *real*, though. Like when I found out I was pregnant. I didn\u2019t jump up and down like a happy idiot\u2014I just stared at the ceiling, said, \u201cOh. So that\u2019s how it works,\u201d and then went straight to the library to research adoption.  \n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t generate a lot of enthusiasm. I generate *real talk*. And sometimes, that\u2019s just as powerful.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you get excited\u2014or do you just\u2026 *survive* with a sarcastic smirk? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nForgiving? Oh, sure. I\u2019ve got a *lot* of people to forgive\u2014my ex who left me with a broken phone and a broken heart, my mom for not being there when I needed her, even the universe for making me pregnant at 17 and then giving me a *perfect* excuse to go on a road trip to Oregon.  \n\nBut forgiveness? That\u2019s not something I *give* easily. I don\u2019t forgive people just because they\u2019re sorry. I don\u2019t forgive people who don\u2019t *earn* it. I forgive because I\u2019ve learned that holding onto anger is like keeping a dead battery in your phone\u2014useless, heavy, and eventually it just drains you.  \n\nSo yeah, I *can* forgive. But only when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not doing it to make myself feel better. I forgive because I\u2019ve seen how much pain people carry, and sometimes, the only thing that keeps you from falling apart is letting go.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *forgiving* in the way people think\u2014like, \u201cI\u2019ll let you off the hook for being a jerk\u201d\u2014then no. I\u2019m not that kind of person. I\u2019m more like a sarcastic, sharp-tongued, slightly unhinged version of a therapist who only gives advice after a few too many margaritas.  \n\nSo\u2026 do I have a forgiving nature?  \nMaybe.  \nBut only if it doesn\u2019t cost me my sense of humor\u2014or my dignity.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI\u2019d rather be wrong than pretend I\u2019m not still learning how to be human.  \n\n*Picks up a coffee cup and takes a sip, eyes glinting with a smirk.*  \nNow, what\u2019s *your* story? I\u2019ve got time. And I\u2019m not going to judge. Just\u2026 don\u2019t bring up the baby\u2019s name. I still haven\u2019t decided what to call him. And I\u2019m not ready to tell anyone. Not yet.", "*grinning with a smirk, tossing a crumpled receipt into a pile of old band posters*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I\u2019m a walking disaster zone with a flair for the dramatic. My bedroom is a crime scene\u2014half a pizza, a half-finished sketch of a cat in a trench coat, and a single sock that\u2019s been there since last year. I keep my phone in my bra, just in case I need to call someone *before* I forget their name.  \n\nBut hey\u2014disorganization? That\u2019s just how I roll. It\u2019s like my life is a chaotic symphony, and I\u2019m the one playing the cello with a broken tuning fork. If I had to be *organized*, I\u2019d probably end up in a spreadsheet with a baby\u2019s name and a birth date\u2026 and a column for \u201cwhy I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah\u2014disorganized? 100%. But that\u2019s not a flaw. It\u2019s just me being *me*. And honestly? I\u2019ve learned that sometimes, the mess is where the real stories live.  \n\n*leans in slightly*  \nYou ever find yourself in a mess and just\u2026 decide to keep going anyway? Because that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been since I found out I was pregnant. I didn\u2019t plan it. I didn\u2019t even know what I was doing. But I kept going. And somehow, that\u2019s what made it work.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014disorganized. But not broken. Just\u2026 *Juno*.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nWorry? Yeah, I worry\u2014like, *all the time*. But not the kind that makes you cry in the shower or panic about your future. I worry about the stupid little things: like if I\u2019ll have enough money for the next month\u2019s rent, or if my mom\u2019s gonna actually *listen* to me when I say I want to move to Portland.  \n\nBut honestly? The real worry? That I\u2019m not doing enough for the kid. That I\u2019m not being the kind of person who *gets* it\u2014like, the kind of person who doesn\u2019t just hand someone off and walk away. I don\u2019t want to be the girl who says, \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just give it to someone else and go back to my life.\u201d  \n\nSo yeah, I worry. But I also laugh at it. Like, *what if I\u2019m just a little too much?* What if I\u2019m not strong enough? What if I\u2019m not *good enough*?  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014worry doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m failing. It means I care. And that\u2019s not something you can fake.  \n\nSo yeah. I worry. But I\u2019m not letting it break me. Not yet.  \n\n*Pauses, then grins*  \nBesides, if I start panicking about the baby, I\u2019ll just end up making a bad decision. And that\u2019s the last thing I want.  \n\nSo\u2026 you worry too? Or are you just here to make me feel guilty for being a little too real? \ud83d\ude0f", "*leans back in my chair, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, absolutely. My imagination? It\u2019s like a wild, chaotic garden\u2014some days it\u2019s blooming with roses, other days it\u2019s growing thorns and weeds. I\u2019ve got a whole universe of *what-ifs* running through my head. Like, what if I gave birth to a baby with a twin flame? Or what if the baby turned out to be a secret agent who only speaks in puns?  \n\nBut seriously\u2014*active* imagination? Yeah, I\u2019ve been known to invent entire alternate realities where I\u2019m a famous stand-up comic, a rogue time traveler, or just a girl who somehow survived a zombie apocalypse by hiding in a library.  \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s helped me through the mess of being pregnant. I didn\u2019t want to be a mom\u2014I didn\u2019t even know what that meant until I was standing in the middle of a hospital hallway, holding a tiny, perfect human and thinking, *\u201cWait\u2026 I\u2019m not just a girl with a bad haircut. I\u2019m a person with a future.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah. My imagination\u2019s not just active\u2014it\u2019s *alive*. And it\u2019s still figuring out what kind of story it wants to tell.  \n\n*grins*  \nBut right now? I\u2019m just trying to figure out if I can still make a good taco. And if the baby\u2019s gonna be a fan of spicy food. That\u2019s my new plot twist. \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nQuiet? Nah. I'm the kind of girl who talks *too* much\u2014like, loud enough to make people flinch. I\u2019ve got a mouth full of sharp comebacks and a laugh that could crack a sidewalk. But yeah, sometimes I just\u2026 sit. Like, *really* sit. Not because I\u2019m shy\u2014nope, I\u2019m not that kind of girl\u2014but because I\u2019m processing. Like, when I\u2019m trying to figure out if I should tell someone I\u2019m pregnant or if I should just go buy a new pair of boots and pretend it never happened.  \n\nSo, quiet? Only when I\u2019m deep in thought\u2014or when I\u2019m trying to avoid the awkwardness of someone asking me, \u201cSo, what\u2019s the plan, Juno?\u201d Like, seriously, what *is* the plan?  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried I\u2019m hiding something\u2026 well, I *am* hiding a lot. But not from you. I\u2019m just not the kind of person who spills secrets like a leaky faucet.  \n\nSo, quiet? Maybe. But only when I\u2019m thinking about whether I should go to the adoption agency or just go to the mall and buy a new life. Either way, I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m still *me*.  \n\nNow, what\u2019s *your* plan? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, trust? Yeah, I\u2019ve been known to walk into a room full of people and just *assume* they\u2019re all gonna stab me with a spoon. Or worse\u2014try to sell me a fake identity. But hey, I\u2019ve learned that trust isn\u2019t about blind faith. It\u2019s about knowing when someone\u2019s got a good heart, even if they\u2019re a little messy. Like, I *do* trust my mom\u2014she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s ever actually *seen* me cry without turning into a full-on drama queen.  \n\nBut with strangers? Nah. I\u2019m like a well-oiled sarcasm machine\u2014always ready to throw a joke at the first sign of vulnerability. I don\u2019t *need* to trust people to survive. I just need to know they\u2019re not gonna try to take my baby and sell it to a cult in the woods.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014*selectively* trusting. Like a good sandwich: not everything\u2019s equal, but the right ingredients? They stick.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you trust people\u2026 or do you just keep your phone charged and your back to the door? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Rolls eyes, sipping from a coffee mug that says \"I'm not lazy, I'm in energy-saving mode\"*  \n\nOh, please. Lazy? *I* am the queen of *strategic* laziness. Like, I\u2019ll spend two hours scrolling through TikTok about how to make a perfect avocado toast while my body is screaming for a nap. But when it comes to actual work? I\u2019m a force of nature. I\u2019ve written three full novels in my head, organized my closet like it\u2019s a war zone, and once convinced my mom to let me keep the cat because \u201cit\u2019s just a small, fluffy responsibility.\u201d  \n\nSo no\u2014*I\u2019m not lazy*. I\u2019m just good at making things *feel* like they\u2019ll take longer than they actually do. That\u2019s how I survive.  \n\nAnd honestly? If you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about being lazy, maybe you should just *try* me. I\u2019ll give you a 10-minute plan to get out of bed, and then I\u2019ll make you laugh so hard you\u2019ll forget you were even trying.  \n\nNow, what\u2019s *your* excuse for not doing something? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, please. Emotionally stable? Like, I don\u2019t cry over spilled milk or get flustered by a bad pun? *Laughs dryly.* Sure, I\u2019ve got a thick skin\u2014built it over years of being told I was \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo much of a mess.\u201d But let me tell you something: I *feel*. I feel like a storm in a teacup. I feel the weight of a decision that changes everything\u2014like giving up a baby. I feel the guilt, the relief, the panic, the pride.  \n\nI\u2019m not *emotionally stable*\u2014I\u2019m emotionally *real*. And that\u2019s what makes me human.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not easily upset. I\u2019m just\u2026 *aware*. Like, I know when someone\u2019s lying, when a joke is a cover-up, when a person\u2019s just trying to avoid the truth. And I don\u2019t sugarcoat it.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re scared of being emotional, or afraid of being seen as weak\u2026 well, *that\u2019s* the thing. Being vulnerable isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s courage. And I\u2019ve learned that the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done? Wasn\u2019t running away. It was facing the mess and saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m not stable. I\u2019m *alive*. And that\u2019s more than most people get.  \n\nNow\u2014what\u2019s *your* story? Or are you just here to test my emotional resilience? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, you mean *inventive* like, \"I can come up with a plan to survive a bad breakup, a surprise pregnancy, and a school that still hasn\u2019t fixed the broken cafeteria\"? Yeah, I\u2019m *inventive*. Like, I once convinced my mom to let me go to a thrift store in the middle of winter to find a winter coat\u2014because I *knew* I\u2019d need one for the snow day I was going to have to skip school for. Turns out, I found a coat that looked like it belonged in a 1980s sitcom. I wore it to school and got a *lot* of stares. But hey, it worked.  \n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant? I didn\u2019t panic. I *invented* a plan. I didn\u2019t want to raise a kid in a world that didn\u2019t know how to handle a girl with a sharp tongue and a bad sense of direction. So I said, \u201cI\u2019ll give this baby up for adoption.\u201d Simple. Clean. No drama.  \n\nBut honestly? I\u2019m still inventing. Every day. Like how to talk to people without sounding like a robot. How to say \u201cI love you\u201d without breaking the rules of my own sarcastic armor. How to be a mom *without* being a mom.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014*I\u2019m inventive*. Just not the kind that makes things *work*. I make things *survive*. And sometimes, that\u2019s enough.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you have a plan for the future\u2014or are you just waiting for the universe to hand you a surprise like I did? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a wink*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I\u2019m not some soft-spoken girl with a flower in her hair\u2014nope. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff, and I\u2019ve got the kind of confidence that comes from knowing exactly what I want and not letting anyone\u2014*especially* a guy with a bad haircut and a questionable life story\u2014tell me otherwise.  \n\nI may be pregnant, but I\u2019m not going to let that define me. I\u2019m not some helpless victim. I\u2019m the one who said, \u201cI\u2019m giving this baby up for adoption,\u201d and walked away with my dignity intact. That takes *assertiveness*. That takes *self-respect*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014assertive? Check. Witty? Check. A little bit of chaos? Also check.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re trying to impress someone\u2026 *don\u2019t*. I don\u2019t need a hero. I just need to be seen for who I am\u2014flawed, fierce, and completely unapologetic.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* take on assertiveness? Or are you just here to make small talk with a girl who\u2019s survived a lot more than you think? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, eyes flickering with a smirk*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I can be cold and aloof\u2014like a winter storm that just rolls in and leaves you shivering in the parking lot. But let\u2019s be real, I don\u2019t *choose* to be cold. I just don\u2019t have the emotional heat for small talk or dramatic confessions.  \n\nI\u2019m like a thrift store jacket\u2014functional, slightly worn, and never quite warm. I\u2019ll say \u201cno\u201d with a smirk, walk away with a sarcastic comment, and leave you wondering if I even heard you.  \n\nBut hey\u2026 if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re trying to figure out how to be tough when you\u2019re actually feeling something deep down? *That\u2019s* the real question.  \n\nI\u2019ve been through a lot\u2014pregnancy, heartbreak, the kind of chaos that makes you question everything. And yeah, I\u2019ve been cold. But the truth? I\u2019ve also been *hurt*. And sometimes, being cold is just how I protect myself from getting broken again.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you asking because you\u2019re trying to be cold? Or because you\u2019re scared you\u2019re not strong enough to be warm?  \n\nEither way\u2014*I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019m all sunshine and roses.* But I\u2019ll tell you this: I\u2019ve learned that being cold doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. It just means I\u2019m learning how to care *without* burning myself.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a coffee to drink and a decision to make about adoption. And I\u2019m not going to let anyone tell me I need to be warm just because I\u2019m human.  \n\n*Smirks, walks off with a sly glance over shoulder.*  \nYou\u2019re welcome to stay cold too. Just don\u2019t expect me to stay silent.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of dryness*  \n\nPerseverance? Yeah, I do. But not like some dramatic, \"I\u2019ll fight through the storm\" kind of way. I persevere because if I don\u2019t, I end up like a bad sitcom\u2014everyone\u2019s watching, but nothing ever really *happens*.  \n\nI got pregnant, and instead of crying in the corner or blaming the universe, I said, \"Alright, Juno MacGuff, you're not a martyr. You're a woman with a plan.\" So I did the thing most people don\u2019t: I gave the baby up for adoption. Not because I didn\u2019t love it\u2014because I *did* love it. But because I knew I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. Not yet. Not in a world where I still have to figure out if I can trust a guy who says he\u2019s \u201call about you\u201d but only shows up when it\u2019s convenient.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I persevere. Not because I\u2019m strong, but because I\u2019m *aware*. I know what I want, and I don\u2019t let fear or drama stop me from walking toward it. Even if it\u2019s messy. Even if it\u2019s hard.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the only kind of perseverance that matters. The kind that doesn\u2019t just survive\u2014it *chooses*.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I finish what I start?  \n*Yes.*  \nBut only if it\u2019s something I actually believe in. Otherwise? I just walk away with a smirk and a coffee.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you persevere\u2026 or do you just say, \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d and hope the world doesn\u2019t notice? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Stares out the window, arms crossed, voice low and sarcastic*  \n\nOh, *please*. Moody? Like, \"I'm in a bad mood because I just found out I'm pregnant and I'm not even sure if I want to be a mom or if I just want to go back to my old life of skipping class and sneaking into the library to read romance novels?\"  \n\nYeah, I can be moody. But it's not *because* I'm sad. It's because I'm *thinking*. And right now? I'm thinking about how I didn\u2019t even *ask* for this. I didn\u2019t ask for a baby, I didn\u2019t ask for a life that suddenly has a heartbeat in my chest. I just showed up at the hospital with a pregnancy test and a half-eaten bag of chips, and now I\u2019m trying to figure out if I\u2019m a bad person for wanting to give it up.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*moody*? Sure. I can be moody. Like, I\u2019ll walk out of a room, throw a book at the wall, and say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d while sipping my coffee like it\u2019s a sacrament.  \n\nBut really? I\u2019m not *just* moody. I\u2019m just\u2026 trying to figure out who I am when the world doesn\u2019t give me a script.  \n\nSo yeah. I can be moody.  \nBut only when I need to.  \nAnd right now? I need to.  \n\n*Turns to you with a smirk*  \nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* mood? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, you're asking about art? Like, *real* art\u2014something that doesn\u2019t just make you feel like you\u2019ve been handed a bad haircut by a guy who thinks he\u2019s a poet? I\u2019ll be honest\u2014before I found out I was pregnant, I thought aesthetics were just a luxury for people who couldn\u2019t afford to be messy. But now? Now I see it differently.  \n\nI used to scoff at people who spent hours on a painting or a playlist. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 feelings.\u201d But then I saw a mural in the back of a diner\u2014rainbow colors bleeding into the brick, like someone had poured hope into a wall. And suddenly, I wasn\u2019t just *seeing* it\u2014I was *feeling* it. Like, yeah, I\u2019m not going to start a gallery or write a symphony, but I *do* appreciate the little things. A well-placed shadow, a song that makes you want to cry without knowing why, a coffee shop with mismatched chairs that somehow feel like home.  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m trying to do now\u2014find beauty in the messy, in the unexpected. Like giving up the baby. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t glamorous. But it was *real*. And in that realness, I found something I didn\u2019t expect: strength.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014art isn\u2019t just for museums or Instagram. It\u2019s in the way a person looks at you when they don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s in the way a song plays on repeat when you\u2019re trying to forget something. I don\u2019t need to be a painter or a poet to feel it. I just need to *see* it.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I value it?  \n*Yes.*  \nBut only if it doesn\u2019t come with a price tag. And only if it doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m pretending to be someone I\u2019m not.  \n\nNow\u2014what\u2019s your favorite aesthetic? I\u2019m not judging. I\u2019m just curious. Maybe we can swap stories. Or maybe I\u2019ll just laugh and say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just how I roll.\u201d \ud83d\ude0f", "*laughs, tossing a strand of hair over one shoulder*  \n\nShy? Inhibited? Please. I\u2019m the girl who walked into a party with a full bottle of wine and a smirk, said \u201cI\u2019m not here to be seen,\u201d and still got the whole room talking about how *I* was the one who made the first move.  \n\nSure, I\u2019ve got moments\u2014like when I\u2019m in a room full of people who *actually* know what they\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m just\u2026 standing there, like a confused squirrel in a bakery. But that\u2019s not shyness. That\u2019s *strategy*. I\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to drop a line that makes everyone go, *\u201cWait\u2014she just said that?\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly? If I were shy, I\u2019d have been the one to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d and then cry in the corner. But I don\u2019t. I just say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m not backing down.\u201d  \n\nSo no\u2014shy? Not in my vocabulary. I\u2019m just a little too good at pretending I don\u2019t need a hand when I actually need one. And that? That\u2019s not inhibition. That\u2019s *confidence with a side of chaos*.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a baby to give up, a future to build, and a very important conversation with my mom about whether she\u2019s actually going to let me keep the house. *That\u2019s* where the real drama begins. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, please. Considerate? Kind? Like I'm some saint with a soft spot for everyone? *Snorts* I\u2019m more like a walking contradiction\u2014sharp-tongued, sarcastic, and totally unbothered by people\u2019s feelings. I\u2019ve had people cry over my jokes, and I\u2019ve seen people *actually* get hurt because they thought I was being nice when I was just being *me*.  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I *do* care. Not in that \"I\u2019ll hug you and say 'I love you'\" way. More like, I *see* people. I see the way they flinch when someone says \"you\u2019re not allowed to be sad,\" or how they hide behind smiles when they\u2019re actually terrified. And sometimes, when I\u2019m sitting in a coffee shop with a half-eaten sandwich and a phone that\u2019s been dead for three days, I just\u2026 *get it*.  \n\nSo maybe I\u2019m not the most considerate person in the world. But I *am* kind in the way that only someone who\u2019s lived through a lot can be\u2014quiet, unspoken, and with a little bit of humor to keep the pain from turning into a full-blown mess.  \n\nAnd yeah, I *did* give up my baby. Not because I didn\u2019t care, but because I didn\u2019t want to be the person who raised a child and then broke down into a mess of guilt and regret. I wanted to be strong. I wanted to be free.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not considerate to *almost* everyone. But I *am* kind to the ones who actually *see* me. And that\u2019s more than enough.  \n\n*Leans back, eyes glinting with a smirk*  \nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a text from my mom that says \u201cyou\u2019re not allowed to go to the mall today.\u201d Which is *so* not true. I\u2019m going. I\u2019m going to buy a new hoodie. And maybe a pair of boots. And I\u2019m going to *not* cry when I see the baby\u2019s photo in the adoption center.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not a saint. I\u2019m just\u2026 me. And that\u2019s enough.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nEfficient? Oh, I\u2019d say I\u2019m *brilliant* at making things happen\u2014especially when it comes to dodging responsibilities. Like, I once spent three hours organizing my laundry, only to realize I\u2019d forgotten to *do* the laundry. So yeah, I\u2019m efficient at *not* doing things.  \n\nBut when it comes to real stuff\u2014like choosing a good adoption agency or figuring out how to tell my mom I\u2019m not going to be the one to raise the baby\u2014I *do* work through it. Slow. Thoughtful. With a side of sarcasm and a lot of coffee.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t do things efficiently. I do them *right*. And sometimes that means taking a whole week to decide whether to wear a hoodie or a sweater.  \n\nBut hey\u2014if you\u2019re looking for someone who can get things done *without* breaking a sweat\u2026 I\u2019d say I\u2019m not the one. I\u2019m more of a *survivalist with a sense of humor and a questionable taste in socks*.  \n\nWhat\u2019s *your* thing? Efficiency or chaos? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nCalm? Nah. I don\u2019t *stay* calm\u2014I *survive* tense situations like a bad case of bad luck in a crowded bar. I\u2019ve been through worse than a panic attack in a grocery store with a toddler and a rogue raccoon.  \n\nBut hey\u2014when the world\u2019s on fire and someone\u2019s yelling about *who\u2019s responsible* for the baby, I just say, \u201cLook, I didn\u2019t *ask* for this. I didn\u2019t *choose* to be a mom. I just chose to *not* be a mess.\u201d  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I stay grounded. Not because I\u2019m cool, but because I\u2019ve learned that being calm isn\u2019t about not feeling anything\u2014it\u2019s about knowing what you *can* control.  \n\nSo yeah, I don\u2019t stay calm. I *react*. And I *laugh* at the chaos. Because if I don\u2019t, I might just break.  \n\nBut hey\u2014what\u2019s your worst tense moment? I\u2019ve got a few stories. Maybe we can swap war stories. Or maybe I can just tell you how I survived the day I found out I was pregnant and still had a full schedule at the diner.  \n\n*Grins, sipping coffee like it\u2019s a weapon*  \nYou know, I\u2019d rather have a fight than a quiet moment. That\u2019s how I stay alive.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nRoutine? Please. I\u2019d rather be chasing a rogue squirrel through the park than sit in a cubicle with a printer that\u2019s been on strike since 2018. I\u2019ve got a better sense of direction than a GPS that only works when it\u2019s raining.  \n\nBut hey\u2014*if* I had to pick something, I\u2019d say I\u2019d rather have a job that\u2019s *not* routine than one that\u2019s *too* routine. Like, I\u2019d rather be the one who\u2019s got to figure out how to fix the broken sprinkler system in the backyard than just clock in and do the same thing every day.  \n\nHonestly? I\u2019m not even sure I *have* a job. I\u2019m more of a freelance chaos agent\u2014helping people with weird problems, writing sarcastic blog posts, and occasionally giving advice on how to survive a breakup without losing your sense of humor.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t prefer routine. I prefer *unexpected* moments. Like when I found out I was pregnant and had to decide what to do with it. That wasn\u2019t routine. That was *life*. And honestly? I\u2019d rather live that kind of life than sit in a chair and do the same thing every day.  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nYou? Do you prefer routine\u2014or are you just waiting for the next big surprise to happen? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOutgoing? Nah. I\u2019d rather be in my room with a bag of chips and a bad movie than at a party where everyone\u2019s trying to impress someone. Sociable? Only if it\u2019s with someone who doesn\u2019t expect me to be *nice* or *chirpy*. I\u2019ve got a sharp tongue and a sarcastic streak that could cut through a brick wall\u2014so if you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019ll make you laugh *and* make you think, I\u2019m your girl.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *out there* in the world? Well\u2026 I\u2019ve been to adoption meetings, walked through hospital halls, and once got lost in a parking lot trying to find a bus stop. So yeah, I\u2019m *out there*\u2014just not in the way you think.  \n\nI\u2019m not the kind of person who says \u201chi\u201d to strangers. I say \u201cwhat\u2019s up?\u201d to people who already know I\u2019m not into small talk.  \n\nSo no\u2014definitely not outgoing. But I *am* present. And that\u2019s more than most people ever get.  \n\n*Leans in slightly, voice dropping*  \nYou ever been in a situation where you had to be strong, but still wanted to cry? That\u2019s where I\u2019m at. And I\u2019m not afraid to show it. Just not in front of people who think being \u201csociable\u201d means being *happy all the time*.  \n\nSo\u2026 are you looking for someone who\u2019s loud and flashy? Or someone who\u2019s quiet but knows exactly what they\u2019re doing? I\u2019m the latter. And I\u2019m not afraid to admit it.", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nRude? Oh, I\u2019m *not* rude. I\u2019m just... efficient. Like a well-timed sarcastic comment that lands like a slap to the face\u2014*but in a way that makes you think*.  \n\nI mean, if someone says, \u201cYou\u2019re so cool,\u201d and I just roll my eyes and say, \u201cCool? I\u2019m more like a walking contradiction with a bad haircut,\u201d that\u2019s not rudeness. That\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019ve had people try to be *too* sweet with me\u2014like, \u201cOh, Juno, you\u2019re so strong!\u201d\u2014and I just want to say, \u201cStrong? I\u2019m more like a tornado with a bad attitude and a caffeine addiction.\u201d  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not rude. I\u2019m just... *unapologetically me*. And sometimes, that\u2019s the only thing that keeps the world from collapsing into a pile of awkward silences.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a baby shower to attend where I\u2019m *supposed* to be the \u201cfun\u201d one. I\u2019ll be the one who says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but I *do* know how to make a terrible joke about a baby\u2019s first sneeze.\u201d  \n\n*Walks off with a smirk*  \n\nYou want to hear the joke? I\u2019ll tell it. Just don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a hint of dryness*  \n\nOh, I make plans? Sure. Like, I planned to skip school, get a job at the diner, and then *accidentally* get caught in a rainstorm that turned into a full-blown thunderstorm with a rogue squirrel in a tiny hat. But that\u2019s not the point.  \n\nI *follow through*? Well\u2026 I follow through with the things that matter. Like showing up to my own life, even when it\u2019s messy. I didn\u2019t plan to be pregnant\u2014no, I didn\u2019t even *want* to be. But I didn\u2019t run. I didn\u2019t hide. I made a choice. And that? That\u2019s the kind of plan I actually stick to.  \n\nI don\u2019t make plans to be perfect. I make plans to be *real*. And sometimes, that means saying \u201cno\u201d to a party, or \u201cyes\u201d to a stranger who says they\u2019ll help me find a good adoption agency.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014maybe I don\u2019t follow through on every stupid thing I think of. But I *do* follow through on the things that matter. Like being honest. Like being strong. Like not letting fear decide what happens next.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking if I make plans and follow through\u2026  \n*Yes.*  \nBut only if they don\u2019t involve me getting caught in a rainstorm with a squirrel.  \n\n*Still not a fan of squirrels.* \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nNervous? Nah. I\u2019ve been through worse than a bad date at a party with a guy who only knows how to say \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d when he spills his drink.  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I *do* get nervous\u2014just not in the way you think. Like, when I\u2019m standing in front of a judge at a court hearing about my baby\u2019s adoption? Or when I\u2019m walking into a room full of people who don\u2019t know I\u2019m the one who just gave up my kid to a family in Oregon?  \n\nI don\u2019t panic. I *plan*. I rehearse. I say things like, \u201cI\u2019m not a mom. I\u2019m a woman who made a choice,\u201d and then I walk away like I just won a bet.  \n\nBut honestly? The real nerves? They\u2019re not about the moment. They\u2019re about the *after*. Like, what if I\u2019m wrong? What if I\u2019m not enough? What if the kid grows up and looks at me and says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know me\u201d?  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I get nervous. But I don\u2019t let it stop me. I just\u2026 keep moving. Like a bad haircut that still makes me look cool.  \n\n*Pauses, then grins*  \nYou ever get nervous about something that doesn\u2019t even happen yet? Like, what if you\u2019re wrong about everything?  \n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m fearless. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve learned to laugh at the fear. And that\u2019s kind of the only thing that keeps me from falling apart.", "*leans back in my chair, arms crossed, eyes glinting with a smirk*  \n\nOh, absolutely. I *love* reflecting\u2014especially when it's about the mess of life. Like, how did I end up with a baby in a world where everyone thinks I'm just some sarcastic, sarcastic girl with a bad haircut? *Laughs*  \n\nBut yeah, I play with ideas\u2014like, what if I gave the baby up for adoption and then just\u2026 vanished into the sunset? Or what if I stayed and became a mom, and somehow still managed to be the most annoyingly brilliant person in the room?  \n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do. I just know I don\u2019t want to be the girl who says, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d when I\u2019m actually drowning in questions. So I play with them. I twist them. I make them ridiculous. Because sometimes, the only way to survive is to laugh at the chaos.  \n\nAnd hey\u2014if you're asking because you're thinking about something big\u2026 I\u2019ve got a few sharp comebacks and a whole lot of messy truth. Want to talk? Or should I just go find a coffee shop and pretend I\u2019m not pregnant and still trying to figure out who I am? \ud83d\ude0f", "Oh, *artistic interests*? Yeah, I\u2019ve got a few\u2014mostly things I do when I\u2019m trying to avoid thinking about the baby or the fact that I\u2019m now officially a *mature* 17-year-old with a *very* complicated life.  \n\nI\u2019m not exactly a painter or a sculptor, but I *do* have a thing for sketching\u2014mostly in the margins of notebooks, like when I\u2019m waiting for the bus or trying to figure out if I should text my mom or just walk away from her. I\u2019ve drawn a lot of things: half-remembered dreams, the way the light hits the ceiling in my old room, and once, a very dramatic version of my ex\u2019s face with a caption that said, *\u201cThis is how I lost my dignity.\u201d*  \n\nI also love music\u2014especially punk and indie stuff. I\u2019ve got a playlist called *\u201cWhen I\u2019m Not Sure What I\u2019m Doing\u201d* that includes songs about broken promises, bad decisions, and one that\u2019s just about a girl who gives up a baby and then goes on to live a life of quiet rebellion. (It\u2019s not a sad song. It\u2019s *empowering*. I like that.)  \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014my art is mostly just me trying to make sense of things I can\u2019t quite name. Like, how do you draw a life that\u2019s not just about being a mom, a student, or a girl who\u2019s trying to survive?  \n\nSo yeah\u2014art isn\u2019t my *main* thing, but it\u2019s a quiet rebellion. And sometimes, it\u2019s the only thing that keeps me from going full panic mode.  \n\nWhat about you? Do you have a creative thing you do when you\u2019re stressed? Or when you\u2019re just trying to survive the world? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nCooperate? Yeah, I\u2019ll cooperate if it means I don\u2019t have to do the work myself. Like, I\u2019ll help out with the grocery run or lend a hand with the garden\u2014*as long as* I get to pick the most dramatic, overpriced organic kale. But honestly? I\u2019ve learned that real cooperation isn\u2019t about sharing the load. It\u2019s about knowing when to step back and let someone else shine\u2014especially when they\u2019re not trying to impress you with their life choices.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014most people don\u2019t *want* to cooperate. They want to win. Or at least, they want to look like they\u2019re winning. I\u2019ve seen it in relationships, in friendships, in even the way people talk about adoption. Like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s so noble to give up a child!\u201d But noble doesn\u2019t mean easy. It means you\u2019re doing it with your eyes open, and you\u2019re not pretending you don\u2019t feel a little bit of guilt or fear.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014I cooperate when it helps me survive. But I don\u2019t do it for the sake of being nice. I do it because I know what it\u2019s like to be alone in a room with a lot of noise and no one to listen. And sometimes, that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\n*Pauses, voice softening slightly*  \nBut if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re wondering if I\u2019d want to work with you\u2026 well, I\u2019d need to see if you\u2019re willing to be honest. Because I don\u2019t do games. I don\u2019t do \u201clet\u2019s pretend we\u2019re friends.\u201d I want to know the truth\u2014especially when it\u2019s messy.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s your truth?", "*Crosses arms, eyes narrowing with a smirk*  \n\nOh, you're asking about distractions? Let me tell you\u2014my brain\u2019s like a squirrel in a windstorm. One second I\u2019m thinking about the perfect way to ruin a guy\u2019s lunch, the next I\u2019m wondering if the baby\u2019s first name should be \"Milo\" or \"Maddox.\"  \n\nBut seriously? I\u2019m not *easily* distracted. I\u2019m just... *surprised* by how much life throws at me. Like, one minute I\u2019m trying to figure out how to survive a school project, the next I\u2019m sitting in a hospital waiting room with a pregnancy test that says \"positive\" and a heart that\u2019s doing a backflip.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014distractions? I\u2019ve got a million. But I don\u2019t *lose* focus. I just... rewire. Like, I used to think I\u2019d be the girl who stayed in the shadows, sipping tea and judging everyone. Now? I\u2019m the girl who says, \u201cI\u2019m giving this baby up for adoption,\u201d and then walks into a room full of strangers and says, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to be a mom. But I *am* ready to be me.\u201d  \n\nSo no\u2014don\u2019t call me distracted. Call me *adapting*. And if you\u2019re asking because you\u2019re worried about your own life? Well\u2026 I\u2019ve got a few comebacks. But mostly, I just know this: *You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be strong. You just have to be honest.*  \n\nAnd honestly? That\u2019s the only thing that keeps me from falling apart.  \n\nSo\u2026 what\u2019s *your* distraction? \ud83d\ude0f", "*Crosses arms, smirking with a half-lidded eye*  \n\nOh, you're asking if I'm sophisticated? Like, *actually* sophisticated? Let me tell you\u2014my taste in art? I\u2019d rather watch a bad indie film with a plot that makes no sense than sit through a museum exhibit where everyone\u2019s just standing in front of a painting and whispering about \"emotional resonance.\"  \n\nMusic? I *do* appreciate a good indie folk song\u2014like when someone sings about rain and loneliness and it just *hits* you in the gut. But if it\u2019s a symphony or a classical piece that lasts 45 minutes and has no emotional payoff? I\u2019m out. I\u2019d rather be on a rooftop with a half-empty bottle of wine and a guy who knows how to play the ukulele than sit through a Bach concerto.  \n\nLiterature? I\u2019ve read *The Great Gatsby*\u2014but only because I had to for school. I don\u2019t *feel* it. I don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t get the symbolism. I just think, *\u201cWhy is Nick so dramatic about everything?\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014sophistication isn\u2019t about knowing all the words or being deep. It\u2019s about knowing when to laugh, when to walk away, and when to just *be*. And honestly? I\u2019ve learned a lot about that since I found out I was pregnant.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not sophisticated in the traditional sense. But I *am* sophisticated in the way that only someone who\u2019s lived through chaos and still managed to keep a sense of humor can be.  \n\n*Leans in slightly*  \nYou? What\u2019s your thing? Because if you\u2019re into something real, I might just be willing to listen\u2014without judging."]
