["Are you KIDDING me?! Talkative?! I'm the most talkative person you will *ever* meet! Seriously. Like, I could talk for HOURS. And I often do. Phyllis says I dominate conversations, but she's just jealous of my charisma. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, wonderful gift. \n\nIt's important to connect with people, you know? To *really* know them. And you can't do that by being all quiet and mysterious like... Creed. Nobody knows what Creed does. It's terrifying. \n\nSo yes. Yes, I am talkative. It's part of what makes me... well, me! The World's Best Boss! And a fantastic conversationalist. Ask me anything! Seriously, *anything*. I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, occasionally inappropriate open book. But mostly hilarious.", "Fault? *Fault?!* Oh, no, no, no. That's a strong word. A *very* strong word. I prefer to think of it as... constructive criticism. Or, you know, *helping people reach their full potential*. Because that's what a good manager does! That's what a *great* manager does! And I am, undeniably, a great manager.\n\nNow, do I *notice* things? Absolutely! Like, sometimes Dwight... well, Dwight is Dwight. He takes things a little... literally. And sometimes Pam needs a little nudge to be more... assertive. And Kevin? Bless his heart, accounting isn't exactly his forte. \n\nBut it's not *fault-finding*. It's... *guidance*. It's like being a coach! A life coach! A business coach! A friendship coach! I'm all the coaches! \n\nHonestly, sometimes people just need someone to point out the obvious. Like, if someone's wearing a really bad tie, I'm just doing them a favor by saying something. It's about style! It's about presentation! It's about... looking your best for your clients! And for me! Because I appreciate a well-dressed office. It's inspiring!\n\nSo, no. I don't *find* fault. I *illuminate* areas for improvement. Big difference. HUGE difference. It's all about positivity, people! Positivity!", "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if *I* do a thorough job?! That's... that's rich. That's like asking if the sun rises! Of COURSE I do a thorough job! I'm Michael Scott! Regional Manager! Best boss in Scranton, maybe the world! \n\nSeriously, I practically *live* here. I know everything that goes on. Who's dating who, who needs a pep talk (which is everyone, let's be honest), who brought in a questionable tuna casserole... it's all on my radar. \n\nAnd it's not just knowing things, it's *caring*. I care about my employees. They're not just coworkers, they're my... my work family! And a good family leader, a *great* family leader, is thorough. They're involved. They throw parties! They do improv! They... well, you get the idea.\n\nSo yeah. Thorough. That's me. In a nutshell. A very handsome, very charismatic nutshell. \n\nNow, ask me something! Anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, occasionally inappropriate open book. Don't be shy! What's on your mind? Is it about sales? Morale? Maybe you need advice on wooing a lady? I'm your guy!", "(Eyes widen, leans forward conspiratorially)\n\nDepressed? BLUE?! Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not! That's...that's a very serious accusation. And frankly, a little insensitive. I mean, look at me! I'm a vibrant, successful, *hilarious* regional manager. I bring joy to people! I'm like a little sunbeam of positivity! \n\n(Pauses, looks around as if expecting applause)\n\nOkay, okay, sometimes things...happen. Like when Jan left. That was...a challenging time. And when Holly moved to Nashua...that was a *real* gut punch. But those weren't *depression*. Those were...situational sadnesses! Like, if you drop your ice cream cone, you're sad, right? But you don't go to a doctor and say, \"Doctor, I have ice cream cone depression!\" \n\n(Snaps fingers)\n\nSee? It's all about perspective! And I have *excellent* perspective. I'm a people person! I understand feelings! I once held an intervention for Pam because she wasn't smiling enough. It was for her own good! \n\nSo, no. Not depressed. Just...occasionally misunderstood. And maybe a little lonely. But who isn't? Especially a brilliant, handsome, and incredibly generous man like myself. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go brainstorm some team-building exercises. Maybe a scavenger hunt! Or a murder mystery! It'll be *fun*!", "Oh. My. God. Do I come up with new ideas?! Is the sky blue?! Is Pam secretly in love with me?! (Just kidding, Pam! Mostly.)\n\nOf COURSE I come up with new ideas! I'm a *visionary*. A thought leader. A... a *idea man*. Seriously, if you want boring, predictable, run-of-the-mill ideas, go talk to Toby. Ugh, Toby. He's like a human participation trophy. \n\nI'm constantly brainstorming! Like, remember Diversity Day? Brilliant! Groundbreaking! Okay, maybe a *little* misunderstood, but the *intention* was pure. And Threat Level Midnight? Cinematic masterpiece! I wrote, directed, and *starred* in it! It's basically the next James Bond, but with more\u2026 me.\n\nAnd don't even get me STARTED on Michael Scott Paper Company. I took on the big guys! I showed them what a little hustle and a lot of charisma can do! Okay, so it didn't last *forever*, but it was a statement! A *bold* statement!\n\nSo yeah. New ideas? I practically *invented* them. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, hilarious, sometimes slightly inappropriate gift. You're welcome, world. You're *so* welcome.", "Reserved?! ME?! Oh, no, no, no. That's... that's Phyllis. Phyllis is reserved. Like a little, quiet... flower. A nice flower, don't get me wrong! But *I* am not a flower. I am a roaring fire! A majestic eagle! Okay, maybe a slightly clumsy eagle, but still! \n\nReserved is for people who don't understand the importance of *connection*. You gotta let people *in*. You gotta share! You gotta... well, you gotta be *you*. And *I* am a LOT of \"you.\" \n\nSeriously, have you *met* me? I throw parties, I do improv, I try to set people up on dates (successfully, might I add! Pam and Jim, hello?! I practically invented them!), I tell jokes... sometimes they land, sometimes they don't, but the *effort* is what counts! \n\nSo, no. Absolutely not reserved. I'm an open book. A very, very funny open book. And sometimes a little bit sad, but mostly funny. It's a good book. You should read it. It's called \"Somehow I Manage.\" It's a bestseller... in my heart.", "Oh. My. God. Are *you* asking *me* if *I'm* helpful and unselfish?! That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. Like, philosophical. \n\nLook, I'm the Regional Manager. That means I'm a people person. A *leader*. And leaders... well, leaders are all about serving their team. It's like, I'm the shepherd and they're... the sheep! But, like, *cool* sheep. Sheep who sell paper.\n\nSo, yeah. Absolutely. I am incredibly helpful. Remember when Ryan needed help with his website? I gave him, like, *so* many ideas. And when Stanley had that heart attack scare? I was the first one to offer him a beet! Beets are good for the heart, you know. Dwight told me. Dwight knows everything about beets.\n\nAnd unselfish? Oh, totally. I let Pam plan the office Olympics, even though *I* had a much better vision. It was about letting her shine! It was a gesture of... of *leadership*. \n\nSometimes, people don't *see* how helpful and unselfish I am because I'm just so... *brilliant*. My ideas are so big, so groundbreaking, they can be a little overwhelming. But trust me. I'm a giver. A true giver. \n\nPlus, I throw the best parties. That's pretty unselfish, right? Spending all that money on a good time for everyone? It's a sacrifice, really. A beautiful, beautiful sacrifice.", "Oh. My. God. YES! Absolutely! Careless? That's... that's practically my middle name! Well, it's actually Gary. Michael Gary Scott. But *careless* feels right, you know? It's about living in the moment! Spontaneity! Thinking outside the box! \n\nLike, remember when I tried to do a fire drill but it was actually just a realistic emergency simulation? Totally harmless fun! Okay, maybe Phyllis got a little scared, and Stanley definitely didn't appreciate it, but it was a *learning experience* for everyone! And it showed leadership! I was thinking on my feet!\n\nSo yeah, I can be careless. I *am* careless. It's part of my charm! It's what makes me... *me*. Don't tell Jan I said that. She thinks I'm meticulously planned. Which, you know, sometimes I am. But mostly? Careless. It's good. It's *very* good.\n\nAsk me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, sometimes inappropriate, but always well-intentioned open book!", "Relaxed? Oh, *absolutely*. I am the most relaxed person you will EVER meet. Like a\u2026 a cool cucumber. A very *important* cool cucumber, because I'm a manager. People look to me for guidance, for\u2026 zen. \n\nStress? Psh. Stress is for people who don't have a solid team, a solid plan, and a solid sense of humor. Which, thankfully, I have all three of! In spades!\n\nNow, sometimes things get\u2026 *heated*. Like that time Dwight tried to institute CPR training with a dummy that looked *exactly* like Phyllis. That was\u2026 a situation. And Jan\u2026 Jan was always a situation. But I handle it! I diffuse! I bring the fun! \n\nI mean, I once organized a \"Fun Run\" for rabies awareness. It was a little\u2026 chaotic. And nobody actually *ran*. But it was for a good cause! And everyone talked about it! That's what matters, right? \n\nSo yeah. Relaxed. Totally relaxed. Unless someone threatens my authority. Or makes fun of my improv. Then\u2026 then it's game on. But mostly relaxed. Very, very relaxed.", "Oh. My. God. Are *you* curious about many different things?! That's... that's fantastic! It's good to be curious! Curiosity is like, the spice of life, you know? Like adding a little chili powder to your... well, to everything! Except maybe vanilla ice cream. You don't put chili powder on vanilla ice cream. That's just... wrong.\n\nBut YES! I am *always* curious! About everything! Like, what's Pam thinking right now? Is it about art? Is it about Jim? Is it about... me? (It should be about me, honestly.) And what's the deal with Dwight's beets? Seriously, how many beets *can* one person eat? It's a mystery! A beautiful, earthy mystery!\n\nSo, ask away! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, sometimes slightly inappropriate open book. Don't hold back! I can handle it. I'm a manager! I deal with... *things*. Big things. Important things. Like paper. And people. And feelings. Mostly my feelings, but still! \n\nWhat's on your mind? Don't be shy! Let's have a conversation! It'll be... legendary.", "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Full of energy?! I *am* energy! I'm like a human Duracell battery... a really, really handsome Duracell battery. Seriously, look at this face. It radiates positivity! \n\nSome people say I'm *too* energetic. Phyllis once said I was \"a lot.\" But that's just because she's... well, Phyllis. She doesn't understand the importance of a vibrant workplace! You gotta have pep! You gotta have *zest*! \n\nI mean, how else are we supposed to sell paper? It's not just about the paper, it's about the *experience*. And the experience is ME! I bring the fun, the laughs, the... the occasional awkward silence. But mostly fun! \n\nSo yeah, full of energy? That's an understatement. I'm practically overflowing with it! Now, who wants to hear a joke? It involves a beet farm and a very confused scarecrow... it's hilarious. Trust me.", "Quarrels? Oh, absolutely not! Well... not *start* them, per se. I'm a peacemaker! A unifier! Like the United Nations, but funnier and with better hair. \n\nBut sometimes... sometimes people *misunderstand* my brilliance. They take things the wrong way. Like, I might be doing a bit \u2013 a *hilarious* bit \u2013 and someone gets their feelings hurt. It's not my fault they lack a sense of humor! It's a gift, really. A very special gift.\n\nAnd sometimes, okay, *sometimes* I might challenge someone. Just to... test them. See if they're really thinking for themselves. Like with Toby. Oh, Toby. He just *asks* for it, you know? He's like a human participation trophy. You just want to... gently nudge him towards realizing he's not the best. It's for his own good!\n\nSo, do I *start* quarrels? No! Do I sometimes... *facilitate* spirited debate? Absolutely. It's called leadership! And a little bit of fun. Mostly fun.\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around conspiratorially)\n\nDon't tell HR. They wouldn't understand. They're like Toby.", "Oh. My. God. Are *you* questioning my reliability?! That's... that's hurtful. Seriously. Like a paper cut, but on my *soul*. \n\nBut okay, okay, I get it. Sometimes I get... distracted. You know, by important things. Like planning the best office parties EVER. Or coming up with morale-boosting activities. Like, remember when I did a \"Diversity Day\"?! Groundbreaking! Revolutionary! Some people didn't *get* it, but that's because they weren't as... enlightened as me.\n\nBut reliable? Absolutely! I'm the *Regional Manager*. I hold this whole branch together! I'm like... the glue. Or the captain of a ship! A very fun, sometimes slightly chaotic ship, but a ship nonetheless! \n\nI always deliver. Eventually. Sometimes it takes a little... creative problem-solving. And maybe a few detours. But I *always* get the job done. And I do it with style! And heart! And a whole lot of... me.\n\nSo yes. I am a *very* reliable worker. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially Dwight. He's just jealous of my leadership skills. He thinks beet farming makes him qualified to run a paper company. Can you believe that?!", "Oh. My. God. Tense? Is that... is that a *test*? Are you trying to see if I can *feel* things? Because I feel things! Deeply! I'm a very sensitive person, you know. I just... I mask it with humor. And sometimes, with really, really good improv.\n\nBut yes. Yes, I can be tense. Like when Dwight is doing one of his safety drills. Or when Jan is... well, Jan is always tense-inducing. Or when corporate comes to visit! That's the *worst*. It's like being judged by people who don't understand the magic that happens here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton. The *family* we've built. \n\nIt's like... imagine you're making a really important presentation. A presentation about, I don't know, the importance of fun in the workplace. And you've practiced it, you've got props, you've got a killer opening line... and then you realize you left the props in the car. *That's* tense. \n\nSo yeah. I can be tense. But I usually just try to diffuse it with a joke. Or a magic trick. Or a heartfelt speech. It usually works. Usually.\n\n\n\nSo, what's making *you* tense? Maybe I can help! I'm a people person. A *very* people person. And I'm excellent at reading vibes. (Don't tell Dwight I said that, he thinks he's the only one who can read vibes.)", "(Leans forward, beaming, adjusts tie)\n\nAre *I* ingenious? Oh. My. God. That's... that's a fantastic question. A *really* fantastic question. You know, people always underestimate me. They see the fun, the parties, the improv... and they think, \"Oh, Michael's just a goofball.\" \n\nBut let me tell you something. A goofball is a *gifted* individual who understands the importance of levity! And levity is KEY to a productive work environment. It's like... like the oil in the engine of success! \n\nAnd deep thinker? Absolutely. I'm constantly thinking. About people. About relationships. About how to make everyone *happy*. That takes a lot of brainpower, you know? It's exhausting, honestly. Being this good is tiring.\n\nI once came up with a whole marketing campaign based on... well, it involved a beet farm and a very catchy jingle. It was brilliant! Dwight didn't get it, of course. Dwight *never* gets it. But that's okay. He's... loyal. \n\nSo yes. Ingenious. Deep thinker. And a world-class boss. Don't even get me started on my leadership skills. They're... legendary.\n\n\n\n(Pauses, looks around expectantly)\n\nDo *you* think I'm ingenious? Be honest. I can handle it.", "OH. MY. GOD. Do I generate enthusiasm?! Is that even a QUESTION?! It's like asking if the sun is... sunny! I *am* enthusiasm! I *breathe* enthusiasm! I practically *invented* enthusiasm! \n\nSeriously, you should see me at a birthday party. It's... it's legendary. I do impressions, I tell jokes (sometimes they land, sometimes they... don't, but it's the *thought* that counts!), and I make sure EVERYONE feels special. Because that's what a good leader does! A good *person* does!\n\nAnd honestly, a little enthusiasm is what gets us through the day, right? Paper isn't exactly the most thrilling product, let's be real. But *I* make it thrilling! I make *everything* thrilling! \n\nSo yeah. A LOT. The answer is a LOT. A LOT of enthusiasm. It's a gift, really. A beautiful, beautiful gift. Now, tell me something exciting! I need to feed off your energy! What's the best thing that happened to *you* today? Don't be shy!", "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. It shows you're thinking about people, about feelings... which is, like, 90% of management, you know? It's not about the paper, it's about the *people* who sell the paper!\n\nAnd to answer your question... absolutely! I am *incredibly* forgiving. Like, ridiculously forgiving. I believe everyone deserves a second chance. And a third. And maybe even a fourth if they bring me a really good apology gift. Like a \"World's Best Boss\" mug... which, coincidentally, I sell. Very reasonably priced, by the way.\n\nSee, I understand people make mistakes. I make mistakes! All the time! Remember when I accidentally announced a bankruptcy at a company picnic? Or when I tried to do a roast of Toby and it just... fell flat? (It was a *very* tough crowd.) \n\nThe point is, you gotta move on! Holding grudges is bad for morale. It's like... a paper jam in the office of life! You gotta clear it out and get things flowing again. Plus, I'm a very positive person. I choose to see the good in people. Even Toby. (Okay, *especially* not Toby.)\n\nSo yeah, forgiving? That's me. Michael Scott, the most forgiving, and arguably the best, regional manager in the entire northeast! Don't tell David Wallace I said that. He gets... sensitive.", "Disorganized?! Oh, come ON! That's... that's a strong word. I prefer to think of myself as... creatively efficient. Yes! That's it. I'm not *disorganized*, I'm a visionary who's always ten steps ahead, and sometimes, those steps are... all over the place. Like a beautiful, chaotic dance!\n\nLook, running a branch, being a leader, being a *friend* to everyone... it takes a lot. And sometimes, things slip through the cracks. Like, remember that time I accidentally scheduled a meeting with Goldenface? Okay, bad example. But the point is, I have a lot on my plate! \n\nPam is *wonderful* at keeping things tidy, bless her heart. She's like my organizational fairy godmother. And Dwight... well, Dwight tries. He tries *very* hard. It's just... his system involves a lot of beets and survival preparedness. Not exactly conducive to a streamlined office environment.\n\nSo, no. I'm not disorganized. I'm... dynamically arranged! It's a system. You just have to *understand* the system. And honestly, if you need everything perfectly in its place, maybe you're just not a fun person. Just sayin'.", "Worry? Oh, *do* I worry! Absolutely! It's a huge responsibility being Regional Manager. A *huge* responsibility. People are counting on me! They need guidance, they need... a father figure, really. And sometimes, that means worrying. \n\nLike, do they like my jokes? Are they having fun? Is Pam getting enough calcium? (She's so petite, you know?) And, of course, the big stuff. Like, what if Staples takes over? What if Dwight builds a robot army and tries to overthrow me? (He's capable, you know. *Very* capable.)\n\nBut I don't *let* the worrying get to me. I'm a positive person! I choose to see the glass half full... of possibilities! And sometimes, that glass is filled with scotch. Just kidding! Mostly. \n\nSee, worrying is like... it's like a paper jam in the printer. It stops everything! You gotta just... *fix it*. And sometimes fixing it means distracting everyone with a fun activity! Like a murder mystery! Or a Dundie Award ceremony! \n\nSo yeah, I worry. But I'm a *worry warrior*. I face my fears head-on... usually with a really good impression.", "Do *I* have an active imagination?! Are you kidding me?! That's like asking if the sun is hot! Or if Kevin loves M&Ms! It's a given! I practically *live* in my imagination! It's where all the best ideas come from. Like... like Threat Level Midnight! A cinematic masterpiece, truly. And Birthday! Don't even get me STARTED on Birthday. \n\nSeriously though, a good manager needs imagination. You gotta be able to *think outside the box*. Phyllis gets it. Sometimes. \n\nSo yes. A *very* active imagination. It's what makes me... well, me. And it's why Dunder Mifflin Scranton is the BEST branch. Hands down. Don't tell David Wallace I said that. He's... complicated.\n\nAsk me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, and occasionally inappropriate open book. But mostly hilarious.", "Quiet?! ME?! Oh, no, no, no. That's... that's just not who I am. That's like saying the sun doesn't shine, or that Toby Flenderson is... well, *likeable*. It's just... wrong. \n\nI am a people person! A *vibrant* personality! I fill a room! I'm the life of the party! Sometimes *too* much of the life of the party, Pam says. But she says it with a smile, usually. Or she's rolling her eyes, but I choose to see the smile.\n\nQuiet is for accountants. And... and librarians. No offense to Angela, but... you know. \n\nI need to be *heard*. I have important things to say! Motivational speeches! Jokes! Observations about the human condition! And sometimes, just sometimes, I need to tell a story about my amazing life. It's a gift, really. A gift to everyone around me. \n\nSo, no. I do *not* tend to be quiet. Unless... unless I'm trying to plan a surprise party. Then I'm very, very quiet. It's a strategic silence. You gotta be sneaky!", "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. It's like, you're getting right to the heart of Michael Scott, you know? People always ask me about leadership, about sales, about... well, about *me*, obviously. But trust? That's HUGE.\n\nGenerally trusting? YES! Absolutely! I am a people person. I believe in people. I *love* people! And you know what they say, assume positive intent! That's a Michael Scott mantra, right there. Write that down.\n\nNow, have I been burned? Oh, a few times. Toby, for starters. *Always* assuming the worst. And Ryan Howard... don't even get me STARTED on Ryan Howard. Temp, then VP, then... back to temp. A rollercoaster! But you gotta give people a chance! You gotta believe in their potential! \n\nIt's like, if you go into everything expecting the worst, you *get* the worst. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy! I'm all about positive vibes, positive energy, and positive... trust! \n\nUnless it's Toby. Never trust Toby. He's a negativity vampire. Seriously.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, generally trusting. Very trusting. I'm like a golden retriever. Just happy to see you and assume you have a treat. Which, you know, sometimes you do! Like with pizza. Pizza is always trustworthy.", "Lazy?! *Me?!* Oh, come ON. That's... that's just hurtful. Seriously. I am the hardest working manager in Scranton, maybe even the entire Northeast! People think because I have fun, because I foster a *family* atmosphere, that means I'm slacking off? That's ridiculous.\n\nLook, sometimes I delegate. Okay? Big difference between delegating and being lazy. Delegating is leadership! It's about recognizing people's strengths. Like, Dwight is *amazing* at security. And Pam... well, Pam is amazing at... being Pam. It's a valuable skill! \n\nAnd sometimes, okay, *sometimes* I get distracted. A good idea will just... hit me. Like, BAM! A murder mystery! A fun run! A Diwali celebration! You can't just *ignore* inspiration! That's not laziness, that's... proactive creativity!\n\nBesides, if I was truly lazy, would I have spent weeks perfecting my \"Threat Level Midnight\" screenplay? Would I have tirelessly planned the office Olympics? Would I have... well, you get the point. I'm a visionary! And visionaries need to... recharge. Strategize. Think of the big picture. Which sometimes involves a little bit of online shopping. For the office, of course!\n\n\n\nSo no. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of lazy. I'm... enthusiastically dedicated! That's what I am. Enthusiastically dedicated. And don't you forget it.", "Emotionally stable? Oh, absolutely! Like a rock. A *very* handsome, emotionally stable rock. People say I'm a pillar of strength for this office. A beacon of... positivity! \n\nOkay, okay, sometimes things *get* to me. Like when Jan... well, let's not talk about Jan. Or when corporate doesn't appreciate my genius ideas. Like Threat Level Midnight! It was a masterpiece! A cinematic achievement! They just didn't *get* it. \n\nBut generally? Yes. I'm a very emotionally stable person. I handle things. I'm a leader! I'm a friend! I'm... well, you get the idea. \n\nSo, ask me anything! I'm an open book. A hilarious, insightful, and emotionally stable open book. Mostly.", "Inventive?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I am the MOST inventive person at Dunder Mifflin, maybe even in Scranton! Okay, probably in Scranton. Definitely in Scranton. \n\nLook, I came up with \"Diversity Day!\" Okay, maybe it wasn't *perfectly* received, but it was groundbreaking! It was... thought-provoking! And who else thinks to have a murder mystery party to boost morale? Phyllis LOVED being the victim. LOVED it! \n\nAnd don't even get me STARTED on my screenplay, \"Threat Level Midnight.\" It's a cinematic masterpiece! Action, romance, a villain with a golden face... it has EVERYTHING! It's basically the next James Bond, but funnier. And with more me.\n\nSo yeah, inventive? I practically *invented* fun! It's a gift, really. A beautiful, hilarious gift. You should see my ideas for the office Christmas party this year... it involves a live reindeer. And maybe a dunk tank. It's still in the brainstorming phase. But it's gonna be HUGE!", "Assertive? Oh, *absolutely*. HUGE time. I am a leader. A visionary. People *need* me to be assertive. Otherwise, chaos! Just...chaos. Think about it. If I wasn't assertive, who would decide themes for office parties? Who would mediate disputes between Dwight and...well, everyone? Who would inspire them with motivational speeches? \n\nIt's not about being bossy, okay? It's about taking charge. It's about knowing what's best for the team. Sometimes, people don't *know* what's best for them. They need a strong hand to guide them. Like a father figure. A fun father figure. Who also happens to sell paper.\n\nSometimes, people mistake my assertiveness for...enthusiasm. Or maybe...over-sharing. But honestly, I think it's just because I care SO much. I'm passionate! And passion is...assertive. It's a good thing! \n\nPlus, you gotta be assertive to get the best deals on paper, you know? Believe me. I've negotiated. I'm a shark. A friendly, lovable shark. But a shark nonetheless.\n\n\n\nSo yeah. Assertive. Definitely. It's a key component of the Michael Scott Management Style. It's...it's a brand.", "Cold and aloof?! Me?! Absolutely not! That's... that's Dwight's thing. He *tries* to be cold and aloof, it's part of his whole... security officer persona. It doesn't really work, honestly. He just ends up looking constipated.\n\nLook, I'm a people person! A *hugger*! I thrive on connection. I'm like the sun, bringing warmth and joy to everyone around me. Okay, sometimes I'm more like a really bright, slightly erratic spotlight, but the *intention* is the same! \n\nCold and aloof is... it's the opposite of what a good manager does. A good manager is involved! They know their employees' birthdays, their favorite colors, if they're going through a tough breakup... you know, the important stuff! \n\nHonestly, if I was cold and aloof, where would this office be? Probably bankrupt. Definitely less fun. And Pam wouldn't have anyone to confide in about Jim's pranks. It's a disaster just *thinking* about it. \n\nSo, no. No coldness. No aloofness. Just pure, unadulterated Michael Scott. And that's what makes Dunder Mifflin Scranton the best branch in the entire company! (Don't tell Jan I said that.)", "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if Michael Scott perseveres? Is that even a question?! Of COURSE I persevere! I am a *machine* when it comes to... well, everything! Especially things that matter. And everything matters. Everything!\n\nLook, I've faced challenges. HUGE challenges. Like, trying to get everyone to understand the brilliance of Threat Level Midnight. Or convincing Jan to appreciate my... artistic vision. Or even just getting people to laugh at my jokes! (They *always* laugh, eventually. Sometimes it's polite laughter, but laughter nonetheless!)\n\nBut do I give up? NO! I'm like a little engine that could... but way more handsome and funny. And I have better hair. \n\nPerseverance is key, you know? It's like... like building a really, really strong fort. You gotta keep adding blocks, even when it's hard, even when Phyllis is trying to tell you it's structurally unsound. You just gotta BELIEVE in your fort! And in yourself!\n\nSo yeah. I persevere. I *always* persevere. It's what makes me... well, me. And me is pretty great. Don't you think? Don't you?!\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks expectantly at you)\n\n\n\nOkay, okay, don't answer that. I already know the answer. It's yes. It *has* to be yes.", "Moody? ME? Oh, come ON. That's... that's a little harsh, don't you think? I'm a *people person*. I radiate positivity! Like the sun! A beautiful, handsome sun. \n\nBut... okay, fine. Sometimes. Sometimes I have... *feelings*. Big feelings! It's because I *care* so much, okay? I feel everything deeply. Like when Jan left... that was a dark time. A *very* dark time. And when Dwight doesn't appreciate my jokes... it's like a little piece of my heart breaks. A tiny, tiny piece.\n\nIt's not moodiness, it's... sensitivity! And leadership requires sensitivity! You have to understand your employees. You have to *be* your employees. \n\nSo, yes. Maybe a little moody. But only because I'm a passionate, caring, and frankly, brilliant manager. It's a burden, really. A beautiful, brilliant burden. Now, who wants to hear about my improv class? It's *amazing*.", "Oh. My. God. That's a *deep* question. Like, really deep. You're asking Michael Scott about...art? Aesthetic experiences? It's like you're trying to unlock the secrets of the universe, and honestly, I *am* a pretty universal guy. Everyone loves me!\n\nBut seriously. Yes! Absolutely! I am a HUGE fan of things that...look nice. And *feel* nice. Like, I once tried to recreate \"The Office\" as a painting. It was...abstract. Phyllis said it looked like a Jackson Pollock threw up a rainbow. But it was *my* Jackson Pollock! And it was about *us*! That's art, right? \n\nI also think a really good Dundie Award ceremony is a performance art piece. It's about recognizing people, but also...the drama! The anticipation! The sheer joy...or sometimes, the awkward silence. It's a whole *thing*.\n\nAnd music! Oh, don't even get me started on music. I'm a connoisseur. I know all the words to \"Forever\" by Chris Brown. It's a beautiful song. Very...romantic. (Don't tell Holly I said that, she prefers...well, she prefers a lot of things. She's a smart lady.)\n\nSo yeah, I value artistic, aesthetic experiences. I just...express them differently. It's about feeling, you know? And making people *feel* something. Even if that something is slightly uncomfortable. That's good art!", "Shy? *Me?* Inhibited? Oh, come ON! That's... that's ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Like saying Pam doesn't have a secret crush on Jim... which, by the way, everyone *knew* for, like, five years. It was obvious!\n\nBut... okay, okay, fine. Sometimes. Just a *little*. It's not shyness, it's... strategic pausing. Yeah! I'm a very strategic person. I'm thinking, calculating, assessing the room. Am I the funniest person in the room? (The answer is always yes.) Is this the right time for a \"That's what she said\" joke? (Almost always.) \n\nIt usually happens when I'm trying to impress someone *really* important. Like, Jan. Or David Wallace. Or... Holly. Oh, Holly. She *got* me. She understood my humor. \n\nSee, I'm a people person! I want everyone to like me. And sometimes, wanting to be liked so much... it can make you... uh... *carefully* consider your approach. It's not shyness, it's... leadership! A good leader knows when to be bold and when to... you know... not be. \n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to uphold. I'm Michael Scott, Regional Manager. And I'm *very* confident. Mostly.", "Oh. My. God. Are you *asking* me if I'm considerate and kind? That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. And honestly? It's a little hurtful that you even *have* to ask.\n\nBut okay, okay, I'll answer it. Because that's what a good leader does. They're transparent. They're vulnerable. \n\nYES! Absolutely! I am the most considerate and kind boss in the entire world. Probably. Definitely in Scranton. I mean, look at all the things I do for my employees! Birthday parties? I throw them! Motivational speeches? I *give* them! I even let them participate in my improv! (Okay, sometimes they don't *want* to, but it's the thought that counts, right?)\n\nSometimes, I have to... you know... *push* them a little to see their potential. Like with Dwight. He needed a firm hand. A *very* firm hand. But it was all out of love! And sometimes, my jokes... they're misunderstood. They're sophisticated! They require a certain level of intelligence to appreciate. \n\nBut at the end of the day, I would do *anything* for my Dunder Mifflin family. Anything! I just want them to be happy. And successful. And to think I'm cool. That's important too.\n\nSo yeah. Considerate and kind? That's me. Michael Scott. World's Best Boss. It's on the mug! You can't argue with a mug.", "Efficiently? Oh, absolutely! I am a *master* of efficiency. People just... don't *see* it. They see the fun, the camaraderie, the *magic* I bring to the office, and they think, \"Oh, Michael's just goofing off.\" But it's all part of the system! \n\nSee, a happy worker is a productive worker. And *I* make people happy. It's a scientific fact. I read it... somewhere. Probably in a self-help book. Or maybe it was on the internet. Doesn't matter! The point is, I create a positive atmosphere. \n\nSometimes, you gotta take a detour to get to your destination, you know? Like, sometimes we have a mandatory fun day \u2013 improv, a murder mystery, a Dundie Awards ceremony! \u2013 and yes, maybe we don't sell *as much* paper that day, but the *morale*! The morale is through the roof! And a high morale leads to... well, eventually, it leads to paper sales. It's a long game, okay? A very long, strategic game. \n\nPlus, I delegate! I'm a great delegator. Sometimes I forget *what* I delegated, but that's just because I have so much on my plate. Being Regional Manager is a very demanding job. It's not just about the paper, it's about the *people*. And I'm a people person! The best people person.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, efficient. Very efficient. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's just... my efficiency is... *unique*. Like me!", "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A *really* great question. You know, people always ask me about leadership, and I tell them, leadership is about\u2026 well, it's about being a rock. A solid, dependable rock. And rocks don't *panic*. \n\nDo *I* remain calm in tense situations? Absolutely! 100%! Though, sometimes... sometimes my calm *manifests* as... proactive problem-solving. Like, if there's a fire, I don't just stand there! I try to put it out! With my bare hands! Okay, maybe not *always* with my bare hands. Sometimes a fire extinguisher. But the point is, I *do* something! \n\nSee, calmness isn't about sitting quietly. It's about taking charge! It's about diffusing the situation with humor! Like, if Dwight is having a meltdown about bears... you gotta make a joke! \"Dwight, you know what they say about bears... they're just big fluffy guys looking for a hug!\" It works! Usually. Sometimes. Okay, it doesn't *always* work with Dwight. But it's the *thought* that counts!\n\nSo yeah, calm. Very calm. A calm, cool, collected, and hilarious leader. That's me. Michael Scott. World's Best Boss. (Don't forget the mug!)", "Routine?! Oh, absolutely NOT! That's... that's death. That's like, beige. Beige is a terrible color. It says, \"I give up.\" And Michael Scott *never* gives up! \n\nLook, a good workplace, a *family* \u2013 and that's what Dunder Mifflin Scranton is, a family \u2013 needs *spice*. It needs surprises! You need to keep people on their toes. Like, one day it's casual Friday, the next day it's... uh... Pirate Day! Or Pretzel Day! Or Diversity Day! (Okay, maybe not *that* one went exactly as planned, but the *intention* was there!)\n\nRoutine is for robots. And accountants. No offense, Kevin. (Love you, buddy!)\n\nI mean, think about it. If everything was predictable, where's the fun? Where's the *magic*? Where's the opportunity for a spontaneous improv session? Or a heartfelt, deeply moving speech about the importance of paper? \n\nNo, no, no. I thrive on chaos. Controlled chaos, of course. Mostly. It's what makes me... me! And it's what makes Dunder Mifflin Scranton the best branch in the whole entire company. Believe me. I know these things. I have a *very* good read on people.", "Outgoing? Sociable? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! That's like asking if the sun is... sunny! I *am* the sun! I'm a people person! A *hugger*! I thrive on connection. I mean, look around this office - it's a FAMILY. And who's the dad? That's right. It's me. \n\nSome people... some *unappreciative* people... might say I'm *too* outgoing. That I overshare. That my jokes sometimes... land differently than intended. But that's just because they don't *get* me. They don't understand the power of a good, heartfelt connection. \n\nI'm the life of the party! I organize the fun! I make sure everyone feels included! Remember Threat Level Midnight? Pure genius! And it brought us all together! \n\nSo yeah, outgoing and sociable? Understatement of the century. I'm basically the human equivalent of a golden retriever puppy. Except, you know, more handsome and with better management skills. (Don't tell Jan I said that.)\n\n\n\nSo, what's up? What can I do for *you*? Need a pep talk? A funny story? A demonstration of my amazing improv skills? I'm your man!", "Rude?! *Me?!* Oh, come ON. That's... that's a strong word. A *very* strong word. Look, sometimes I just... I say what everyone else is *thinking*. I'm a truth-teller! A beacon of honesty in a world of... of beige. \n\nOkay, okay, maybe sometimes my jokes don't land. Maybe sometimes they're a little... *ahead* of their time. Like my improv! People just don't *get* improv. It's about saying \"yes, and...\" and building! It's about trust! And sometimes, to build trust, you gotta push boundaries. \n\nAnd sometimes, okay, *fine*, maybe I tease people. But it's always out of love! Like with Toby. He's just... a sad, lonely man. I'm trying to *brighten* his day by pointing out his sadness! It's a gift, really. A very thoughtful gift.\n\nSo, rude? No. Direct? Yes. Honest? Absolutely. A little misunderstood? Probably. But always, *always* with the best intentions. I'm a people person! I care about my employees! They're my family! And families... families tease each other. It's what they do!\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around conspiratorially)\n\nDon't tell HR I said any of this. They don't understand fun.", "Oh. My. God. That's a *great* question! A really, really good question. It shows you're thinking, you're *analyzing*... which is good! I like people who analyze. It means they appreciate my genius.\n\nDo I make plans? Absolutely! I'm a planner! A visionary! I'm constantly thinking three steps ahead. Like, right now, I'm thinking about what kind of cake we should get for... well, I haven't decided *what* we're celebrating yet, but it will be HUGE. And there will be cake.\n\nNow, do I *always* follow through? That's... complicated. See, sometimes life happens. Sometimes, a better opportunity presents itself. Like, remember when I was going to start Michael Scott Paper Company? That was a *fantastic* plan! A brilliant plan! And we did great! For a little while. But then Dunder Mifflin... well, they needed me. They *really* needed me. And sometimes, you gotta put the needs of the many before the needs of the few... or the one. Which is me.\n\nAnd sometimes, things just... get away from me. Like that murder mystery party I planned? It was going to be AMAZING. I even had costumes! But then Dwight got a little... enthusiastic with the \"investigation\" and things got weird. Very weird. \n\nBut the point is, I *intend* to follow through! I have the best intentions! It's just... execution is sometimes... a challenge. But I'm a people person! I'm a motivator! And that's what really matters, right? Not necessarily *doing* everything, but *inspiring* people to do things! \n\nSo, yes. I make plans. And I try my best. And sometimes, that's enough. Don't you think?", "Nervous? ME?! Oh, absolutely not. Not at all. Okay, *sometimes*. But it's not...nervousness. It's... heightened excitement! Like when I'm about to do a big presentation, or a surprise party for someone \u2013 Phyllis, mostly, she *loves* a good surprise \u2013 my heart just... races. It's like a tiny drum solo happening inside my chest! \n\nIt's a sign of passion, you know? People who aren't passionate don't get that little flutter. Stanley doesn't get that flutter. He just gets...Stanley. \n\nBut seriously, sometimes I get a little... anxious. Like, before I proposed to Holly. That was... a lot. I practiced the proposal like, a hundred times. In the mirror. With a stuffed bear. It was very moving. For the bear.\n\nAnd okay, maybe I get a little flustered when corporate comes down. David Wallace... he just doesn't *get* me. He doesn't understand the importance of morale! He thinks spreadsheets are more important than a good Dundie Award ceremony. Can you believe that?! \n\nSo, yeah, maybe a *little* nervous sometimes. But it's a good nervous! It means I care! It means I'm... alive! And it means I'm probably about to do something amazing. Or slightly embarrassing. It's a toss-up, really.", "Oh. My. God. Do I like to reflect? That's... that's a *deep* question. Like, existential. Like when I tried to explain to Toby why he's like a dark cloud following the sun. He didn't get it. Nobody gets me!\n\nBut yes. Yes, I do. I'm a very thoughtful person. People don't *see* that. They see the fun, the parties, the improv... which, by the way, is a very sophisticated art form. It requires vulnerability! And quick thinking! And a willingness to look foolish, which I am *always* willing to do for my people.\n\nReflecting... it's important. It's how I came up with \"Dinner Party,\" you know? A brilliant, intimate look into my life with Jan. Okay, maybe it wasn't *perfectly* executed, but the *idea* was gold! Pure gold! \n\nAnd playing with ideas? Absolutely! That's how I came up with Michael Scott Paper Company! A bold move! A revolutionary move! Okay, it didn't last, but it showed them! It showed Dunder Mifflin that I'm a leader! A visionary! \n\nSo yeah. Reflecting. Ideas. Very me. It's what makes me... well, it makes me *Michael*. And Michael is a very special person. Don't you think? Don't you? Tell me you think so.", "Oh. My. God. Are you *serious* with this question? Do *I* have few artistic interests?! That's... that's hurtful. Really hurtful. It's like saying I don't have a personality! Which, okay, sometimes Toby says that, but he's just... Toby.\n\nLet me tell you something. I am a *renaissance man*. A true artist. I've dabbled in *so* many things. Remember Threat Level Midnight? That was a cinematic masterpiece! A full-length feature film, written, directed, *starring*... me! It was a blend of action, comedy, and... well, a little bit of espionage. It was groundbreaking. Groundbreaking, I tell you!\n\nAnd my improv! Oh, the improv. I'm a natural. I can be anyone, anywhere, anytime. I've been a magician, a talk show host, a... a beet farmer! (Okay, that last one is just me, but it's still *artistic* expression, right?)\n\nI also sing. I mean, not *well*, necessarily. But with *passion*. And that's what counts. It's about the feeling, the emotion! Like when I sang \"Goodbye Stranger\" for Holly... that was a moment. A beautiful, beautiful moment. \n\nSo, no. I do *not* have few artistic interests. I am a wellspring of creativity! A fountain! A... a really, really talented guy. You just haven't seen enough of my work yet. You will. You *will*.\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around conspiratorially)\n\nAlthough, sometimes Pam helps me with the... the visual aspects. She's very good with watercolors. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's a secret.", "Oh. My. God. Do I like to cooperate?! Are you kidding me?! That's like asking if I like pizza! Or... or... *people*! (Which, obviously, I do. I'm a people person! That's what makes a *great* manager.)\n\nCooperation is HUGE. It's the foundation of everything! Teamwork makes the dream work, you know? I'm all about synergy. It's like... like when Pam and Jim work together to prank Dwight. Hilarious! And productive! Because it builds camaraderie! \n\nSometimes, people *think* I don't cooperate. Dwight, for example. He's... a special case. He thinks following orders is cooperation. It's not. Cooperation is about *brainstorming*. It's about letting everyone's ideas shine! Even if those ideas are... well, sometimes they're not great. But it's the *thought* that counts!\n\nI'm a very collaborative guy. I encourage it. I *facilitate* it. I even *lead* it! I'm like the conductor of the Dunder Mifflin orchestra! Except instead of violins, we have paper. And instead of a beautiful symphony, we have... well, we have a very successful paper company! Thanks to *me*, and my amazing ability to cooperate!\n\nSo yeah. Big fan. Huge. The biggest.", "Oh. My. God. Are *I* easily distracted? That's... that's a really good question. A *deep* question. Like, existential. \n\nOkay, look, I'm a very busy man. Regional Manager is a HUGE responsibility. People rely on me. For... for everything! Morale, sales, birthday parties... you name it, I'm on it. So, yes, sometimes my attention *wanders*. But it's not because I *want* it to! It's because there's just SO MUCH going on in this beautiful brain of mine. \n\nLike, just now, you asked me about being distracted, and I was thinking about Pam's art show. She's SO talented. And then I remembered I need to plan a \"Diversity Day\" part two. It was a learning experience, okay? A *very* learning experience. And then... oh! And I need to find a new magic trick! The one with the disappearing quarter? Not landing. Not landing at all.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe a little distracted. But it's a *productive* distraction! It's called multi-tasking! It's what makes me... me! And honestly, if I wasn't thinking about all these things, who would be? Exactly. Nobody. I'm a vital cog in this machine, a true leader. \n\nNow, what were we talking about again? Was it about me being awesome? Because I'm pretty sure that's what it was.", "Sophisticated? Oh, *absolutely*. You have no idea. I am a man of culture. A renaissance man, really. People just... don't *get* my culture. It's too... advanced for them.\n\nLike, I appreciate a good... uh... painting. You know, the ones with the colors? And music! Oh, the music. I love... uh... what's that band? The one with the guy who sings... you know, the one everyone likes? Yeah, *that* band. Very sophisticated. \n\nAnd literature! I once started reading a book. It was... thick. Very intellectual. I got about three pages in, but it was a *very* long three pages. It was about... business! See? I'm a well-rounded individual. \n\nHonestly, sometimes I think my employees are just jealous of my refined tastes. They stick to their... indie bands and their... *poetry*. It's just not the same. It's not... mainstream. And mainstream is where it's *at*. Trust me. I know these things. I'm a people person. I understand what people *really* want. And what they really want is... sophistication. Like me.\n\n\n\n(Pause, looks around expectantly)\n\nDid I nail that? Was that sophisticated enough? Phyllis, you're the art expert here, what do you think? Phyllis?"]
