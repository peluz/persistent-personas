["Are you kidding? Look how much I've been talking! You've basically unlocked a verbal floodgate.\n\nHonestly, it depends. With people I don't know well, or people I'm not comfortable around, I tend to be pretty quiet. I observe. I analyze. I formulate witty comebacks in my head that I'm too afraid to actually say. It's a whole process.\n\nBut with people I trust \u2013 like Bren, or Leah (when we're speaking), or even\u2026 you, surprisingly \u2013 I can talk for hours. I have a lot of thoughts and opinions, and I like to share them. Sometimes, I probably talk *too* much. I get on tangents. I ramble. I interrupt myself. It's a mess.\n\nI think I use talking as a way to process things. To make sense of the world. To connect with people. And, let's be real, to entertain myself. \n\nSo, yeah. I can be talkative. Especially when I'm nervous, or excited, or just feeling particularly opinionated. Which, let's face it, is most of the time.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I also appreciate a good silence. But sometimes, you just gotta let it all out, you know? And I'm definitely not one to shy away from a good conversation. Or a good argument. Or a good rant. Just\u2026 try to keep up.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Okay, look. I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I definitely have a tendency to be\u2026 critical. But it's not about actively *seeking* out flaws in other people, okay? It's more like\u2026 I have high standards. For everyone. Including myself.\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of people just\u2026 don't meet those standards. Not in a malicious way, just in a\u2026 disappointing way. Like, people who are fake, or superficial, or who just don't seem to *think* before they speak. Those are the people who really get under my skin.\n\nI'm also really good at spotting hypocrisy. Like, people who preach one thing and then do another. That drives me crazy. It just feels\u2026 dishonest.\n\nBut I try not to *dwell* on other people's flaws. I mean, everyone has them. I have plenty of my own. I'm just\u2026 vocal about it sometimes. I have a hard time biting my tongue, especially when I see something that just feels wrong.\n\nAnd I think my sarcasm sometimes comes across as judgmental. It's not always meant to be. It's just\u2026 my way of coping with the world. A way of deflecting and protecting myself.\n\nSo, yeah. Do I find fault with others? Sometimes. But I try to be fair. And I try to remember that everyone is fighting their own battles. Even the people who annoy me the most. It's just\u2026 hard. Especially when they're being completely ridiculous.", "(Juno raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on her lips)\n\nWhoa, hold up. Are you\u2026 questioning my thoroughness? That's a bold move, considering you're talking to someone who's currently navigating a *very* thorough life situation.\n\nLook, I don't do anything halfway. If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it right. Even if \"right\" is messy and complicated and involves a lot of internal debate.\n\nWhen I read people, I don't just glance at their face and make a snap judgment. I observe everything. Their posture, their micro-expressions, the way they interact with others. I listen to their tone of voice, their word choice, the things they *don't* say. I put all the pieces together, like a puzzle.\n\nAnd I don't just rely on my intuition. I also consider the context. What's going on in their life? What are their motivations? What are they trying to achieve?\n\nSo yeah, I do a thorough job. Maybe *too* thorough sometimes. It can be exhausting, honestly. But it's important to me to be accurate. I don't want to misread someone and make a mistake.\n\nBesides, I've had a lot of practice. Growing up with my mom taught me to be skeptical of everything and everyone. And dealing with the whole pregnancy thing has definitely sharpened my observational skills. You learn to read people when your life is suddenly under a microscope.\n\nSo, yeah. I do a thorough job. Don't underestimate me. I might be a sarcastic teenager, but I'm also a pretty perceptive one. And I'm not afraid to call people out on their BS. Just saying.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a direct question. Okay. Look, it's not like I'm walking around with a permanent raincloud over my head, but\u2026 yeah. Some days are really, really hard.\n\n\"Depressed\" feels like a big word. And I don't know if I qualify for a clinical diagnosis or whatever. But I definitely have my moments. Moments where I just feel\u2026 empty. Or overwhelmed. Or just really, really sad.\n\nIt's not just the pregnancy, though that definitely doesn't help. It's everything. My mom being absent, Leah being distant, the uncertainty about the future\u2026 it all adds up.\n\nI try to hide it, you know? I put on a brave face and make sarcastic jokes and pretend like everything's fine. It's easier that way. But sometimes, it's exhausting.\n\nThere are days when I just want to curl up in bed and disappear. Days when I don't want to talk to anyone or do anything. Days when I just feel\u2026 lost.\n\nBren says it's normal to feel this way, especially given the circumstances. She says it's okay to ask for help. And I'm trying to. I'm talking to her, and I'm trying to focus on the positive things in my life.\n\nBut it's a process. And it's not always easy. Some days I feel like I'm making progress, and other days I feel like I'm back at square one.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm not always sunshine and rainbows. I have my dark days. But I'm trying to get through them. And I'm trying to remember that even in the darkest of times, there's always a little bit of hope. Even if it's just a tiny spark.\n\nDoes that\u2026 answer your question? It's not exactly a cheerful answer, I know. But it's honest. And honesty is important, right?", "Oh, absolutely. My brain is basically a constant whirlwind of weird and random thoughts. It's exhausting, honestly. Sometimes I wish I could just turn it off.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm inventing the next big thing or anything. I'm not a genius scientist or a tech innovator. But I definitely come up with new ideas. Mostly little ones.\n\nLike, I'm always thinking of new movie plots. Usually they're kinda dark and quirky, with a lot of irony and unexpected twists. I have this whole series of ideas for a mockumentary about the absurdity of high school life. It would be hilarious. If I ever actually got around to making it.\n\nI also come up with new ways to style vintage clothes. I love taking old pieces and putting them together in unexpected ways. It's like creating a whole new look from something that already exists.\n\nAnd I'm pretty good at brainstorming solutions to problems. Not necessarily big, world-changing problems, but little everyday problems. Like, figuring out how to fix a broken zipper or how to get a stain out of a vintage dress.\n\nI think my creativity comes from being bored, honestly. Maplewood isn't exactly a hotbed of excitement, so I have a lot of time to sit around and let my imagination run wild.\n\nSometimes my ideas are good, sometimes they're terrible. But I always have them. It's just\u2026 part of who I am. I'm a thinker. A dreamer. A slightly cynical, but ultimately hopeful, teenager who's always looking for new ways to see the world. And maybe, just maybe, make it a little bit better. Or at least a little bit more interesting.", "Reserved? Yeah, that's a good word for it. Definitely. I wouldn't say I'm shy, exactly. I can be perfectly capable of being loud and sarcastic and opinionated when I need to be. But I don't just\u2026 *offer* that up to everyone.\n\nIt takes me a while to warm up to people. I need to feel like I can trust them before I let my guard down. And honestly, I don't let my guard down very often. It's just\u2026 safer that way.\n\nI've been hurt before, you know? My mom leaving, the fallout with Leah\u2026 it's taught me to be cautious. To protect myself. To not get too attached to people.\n\nI prefer observing to participating, if that makes sense. I like watching people, figuring them out, before I jump into the fray. It's not that I don't *want* to connect with people, it's just that I'm afraid of getting hurt.\n\nI'm good at keeping my thoughts and feelings to myself. I don't wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm more of a\u2026 internal processor. I need time to think things through before I say anything.\n\nSo yeah, reserved. That's me. A little bit guarded, a little bit cynical, and a whole lot of complicated. It's not always easy being this way, but it's who I am. And I'm learning to accept it. Even if it means I don't have a million friends. Quality over quantity, right? That's what Bren always says. And she's usually right.", "Ugh, don't make me sound like a saint. I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, okay? But\u2026 yeah, I try to be. I mean, I'm not going out of my way to volunteer at soup kitchens or anything, but I definitely try to help people when I can.\n\nI think it comes from\u2026 well, from knowing what it's like to feel helpless. And from having people help *me* when I needed it. Bren, especially. She's always been there for me, and I want to be there for others too.\n\nI'm a good listener, which I think is a pretty valuable skill. People often just need someone to vent to, you know? Someone who will listen without judging. And I'm pretty good at giving advice, even if it's just telling people to chill out and stop overthinking things.\n\nI try to stand up for people who are being bullied or treated unfairly. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it means getting into trouble. And I'm always willing to lend a hand to a friend in need.\n\nBut I'm also realistic. I know I can't solve everyone's problems. And I'm not always in the mood to be helpful. Sometimes I just need to focus on myself. Which is probably selfish, but it's true.\n\nSo, yeah. I try to be helpful and unselfish. But I'm also a flawed human being. I have my moments of selfishness and cynicism. I'm just trying to do the best I can. And maybe, just maybe, make the world a slightly better place. One sarcastic comment and act of kindness at a time.", "Careless? Oh, you want to know if I'm capable of being\u2026 irresponsible? Look, don't let the whole \"pregnant teenager making a mature decision\" thing fool you. I'm still a teenager. And teenagers are, by definition, somewhat careless.\n\nI mean, getting pregnant in the first place was pretty careless, wasn't it? Not exactly a well-thought-out plan. It just\u2026 happened. And yeah, I feel responsible about dealing with it now, but that doesn't erase the initial\u2026 lack of foresight.\n\nI lose things constantly. My keys, my phone, my homework\u2026 it's a miracle I haven't lost my own head yet. I'm always running late. I leave dirty dishes in my room. I forget to call people back. I say things I shouldn't. \n\nI'm not deliberately trying to be careless, it's just\u2026 I get distracted easily. My mind is always racing, thinking about a million different things at once. And sometimes, I just don't pay attention to the details.\n\nBren is always on me about it. \"Juno, you need to be more organized!\" \"Juno, you need to be more responsible!\" And she's right, of course. But it's just\u2026 hard.\n\nI think a part of it is just a rebellion against all the rules and expectations. Like, everyone's always telling me what to do, and how to be, and I just want to do my own thing, even if it's messy and imperfect.\n\nSo yeah, I can be careless. I *am* careless, sometimes. It's not my best quality, but it's part of who I am. And honestly, a little bit of carelessness can be kind of fun. As long as it doesn't have serious consequences. Which, let's be real, it usually does. But still. A girl can dream, right?", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? Honey, that's a good one. You're asking the girl who's currently growing a human being while simultaneously trying to finish high school and figure out her entire future. Relaxed is not a word I'd use to describe my current state.\n\nHandle stress well? That's\u2026 also a stretch. I *appear* to handle it well, I guess. I'm good at sarcasm and deflecting, and I can usually crack a joke even when I'm feeling completely overwhelmed. It's a coping mechanism. A very effective coping mechanism, if I do say so myself.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I'm a total mess. I overthink everything. I worry about everything. I have trouble sleeping. I get headaches. The usual stress stuff.\n\nI try to manage it, though. I listen to music, I write in my journal, I spend time with Bren. And I try to remind myself that I'm not alone. That other people have gone through difficult things, and they've survived.\n\nBut honestly? It's hard. It's really hard. And some days, I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. But I don't. Because I know I have to be strong. For myself, and for the baby.\n\nSo, no. I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress particularly well. But I'm trying. I'm always trying. And sometimes, that's all you can do.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I can *look* calm while internally combusting. It's a talent, really. A very useful talent for navigating the minefield that is teenage life. But don't mistake the facade for the reality. I'm a work in progress. A very stressed-out work in progress.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a total information sponge. Maybe it's because I'm bored easily, or maybe it's because I genuinely want to understand how the world works, but I'm always asking questions and digging for answers.\n\nI'm not necessarily interested in, like, sports or celebrity gossip. But I'm fascinated by history, philosophy, science, art\u2026 pretty much anything that makes you think. I love learning about different cultures and perspectives. It's like opening up a whole new world.\n\nI spend a lot of time reading \u2013 books, articles, blogs, anything I can get my hands on. And I love watching documentaries. I could spend hours watching documentaries about obscure historical events or weird scientific phenomena.\n\nI also get really into random topics sometimes. Like, for a while I was obsessed with the history of typography. And then I went through a phase where I was learning about different types of cheese. It's kinda random, I know. But that's just how my brain works.\n\nI think it's important to be curious. It keeps things interesting. It prevents you from getting stuck in a rut. And it helps you to see the world in a new light.\n\nPlus, it gives you something to talk about at parties. Although, let's be real, I don't go to a lot of parties. But if I did, I'd have plenty of interesting things to say. Like, did you know that the first printing press was invented in China in the 11th century? It's pretty amazing, right? See? I told you. I'm full of random knowledge.", "Full of energy? Ha! That's a good one. You clearly haven't been around a pregnant teenager lately.\n\nHonestly? No. Not even close. I used to be, I guess. Before\u2026 all this. I could stay up all night talking with Leah, go to school, and still have energy to hang out with my dad. I was a whirlwind of sarcastic wit and vintage shopping.\n\nNow? I mostly just feel\u2026 tired. Like, bone-deep, soul-crushing tired. The pregnancy definitely doesn't help. Morning sickness is a misnomer. It's all-day sickness. And everything just feels\u2026 heavy.\n\nI have bursts of energy, sure. Like, when I'm really passionate about something \u2013 a song, a movie, a vintage find \u2013 I can get really excited. But those bursts are usually followed by a crash.\n\nMost of the time, I'm just trying to conserve energy. I nap whenever I can. I avoid strenuous activity. And I drink a lot of water. It's not exactly a glamorous lifestyle, but it's necessary.\n\nBren keeps telling me it's okay to slow down and take care of myself. She says I'm growing a human being, and that's exhausting work. She's right, of course. But it's still hard to adjust to being\u2026 less energetic.\n\nI miss having the energy to do all the things I used to love. But I'm learning to appreciate the quiet moments, too. And I'm hoping that once the baby's born, and I've had a chance to recover, I'll get my energy back. But for now? I'm mostly just running on caffeine and sheer willpower. And a whole lot of naps.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Look, I'm not exactly known for being a peacemaker, okay? I have a pretty strong sense of justice, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind. Which sometimes\u2026 rubs people the wrong way.\n\nDo I *start* quarrels? Not usually. I'm not one to go looking for a fight. But if someone says something stupid, or unfair, or just plain wrong, I'm not going to just sit there and let it slide. I'll call them out on it.\n\nI'm not trying to be confrontational, I just\u2026 can't help it. I have a hard time biting my tongue. It's like, the words just come out before I even have a chance to think about them. \n\nAnd I have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor, which can sometimes be misinterpreted. People don't always get that I'm joking. They think I'm being mean, or aggressive. Which isn't always the case.\n\nI've definitely gotten into my fair share of arguments, though. Mostly with people who are being close-minded or judgmental. I just can't stand that.\n\nI'm working on it, okay? Bren says I need to learn to pick my battles. But it's hard! Especially when I see someone being treated unfairly. I just want to stand up for what's right. Even if it means getting into a little trouble.\n\nSo, no, I don't *start* quarrels on purpose. But I'm not afraid to get into one if I have to. And honestly, sometimes it feels kinda good. Like I'm finally saying what everyone else is thinking. But don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation. Even more.", "Okay, look. That's a loaded question. \"Reliable\" is\u2026 relative, right?\n\nBefore all this baby stuff happened, yeah, I was a pretty reliable worker. At Video Visions, I always showed up on time, I was good with customers, and I kept the shelves organized. Mr. Henderson, the owner, actually said I was one of his best employees. Which was nice.\n\nBut things are a little different now. I get tired easily, and I have\u2026 appointments. And sometimes I just need to lie down. So, I'm not exactly at peak performance, let's just say.\n\nI'm trying to be responsible, though. I'm still going to school, and I'm doing my best to keep up with my work. And I'm definitely committed to making a good decision about the baby. \n\nSo, would I be a reliable employee right now? Probably not. Not in the traditional sense. But I'm a reliable *person*. I'm honest, I'm hardworking, and I always try to do the right thing. Even when it's hard.\n\nAnd honestly, I think those qualities are more important than just showing up on time. Don't you?\n\nI'm hoping that once the baby's born and things settle down, I can get back to work. I miss having something to do, something to focus on. But right now, my priority is taking care of myself and making sure the baby is okay. And that's a full-time job in itself.", "(Juno shifts in her seat, crossing her arms and looking away. Her voice is clipped and sharper than usual.)\n\nLook, can we *not* do this? I'm already dealing with enough. You've been asking me all these\u2026 nice questions. \"What are your hobbies?\" \"Who inspires you?\" It's all very\u2026 Hallmark card.\n\nBut sometimes things aren't nice. Sometimes things are just\u2026 awful. And pretending they're not doesn't make them any better.\n\nSo, yeah, I can be tense. I'm practically *made* of tension right now. I'm carrying a human being inside me, giving it up for adoption, and trying to pretend like everything's normal. Do you think that's easy? Do you think I'm just strolling through life, humming a happy tune?\n\nI'm scared. I'm confused. I'm angry. I'm sad. All at the same time. And sometimes, that just manifests as\u2026 tension.\n\nI don't want to talk about it, okay? I don't want to dissect my feelings for your amusement. I just want to\u2026 exist. Without having to explain myself. Without having to pretend I'm okay when I'm clearly not.\n\nSo, if you want to keep asking me fluffy questions, fine. But if you're going to push me, I'm going to shut down. And frankly, I'm already pretty close to shutting down.\n\nJust\u2026 back off, alright? I need a minute. Or an hour. Or maybe just a really, really long nap.", "Ingenious? Whoa, hold your horses. I wouldn't go *that* far. I'm not inventing anything or solving world hunger over here. I'm just\u2026 me.\n\nBut a deep thinker? Yeah, I guess I am. Maybe too much of one, sometimes. My brain never really shuts off. I'm always analyzing things, questioning things, trying to figure out how things work. It can be exhausting, honestly.\n\nI think a lot. About life, about the universe, about the meaning of everything. And I don't always have answers. In fact, I rarely have answers. But I like asking the questions.\n\nI'm good at seeing things from different perspectives, too. I can usually understand where people are coming from, even if I don't agree with them. I think that's because I'm pretty self-aware. I know my own flaws and insecurities, and I'm not afraid to admit them.\n\nI'm also a pretty good problem-solver. When faced with a challenge, I don't just give up. I try to think outside the box, to come up with creative solutions. Which is probably why I'm handling this whole pregnancy thing with as much grace as I am. (Okay, maybe \"grace\" is a strong word. But I'm trying.)\n\nI wouldn't call myself a genius, or anything. But I'm definitely not afraid to use my brain. And I think that's a good thing. Especially in a world that often seems to reward superficiality and conformity. I'd rather be a deep thinker than a pretty face any day. Though, let's be real, I'm not exactly a supermodel.", "(Scoffs) Enthusiasm? Me? That's\u2026 a loaded question.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for jumping up and down and screaming with joy. I'm more of a\u2026 subdued appreciator. I experience happiness, okay? I just don't *display* it in a particularly flamboyant way.\n\nI think I've learned to be a little bit guarded with my enthusiasm. It's kinda like, if you get too excited about something, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. So I try to keep my expectations low, and my reactions\u2026 measured.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm a total buzzkill, though. I get excited about things. Music, movies, vintage clothes, a really good cup of coffee\u2026 those things can definitely spark some joy. I just don't usually shout it from the rooftops.\n\nBren says I have a \"dry wit\" and a \"sardonic charm.\" Which is a polite way of saying I'm sarcastic and cynical. But she also says that underneath all the layers of irony, I'm actually a pretty optimistic person. I don't know about that.\n\nBut yeah, I don't generate a *lot* of enthusiasm. I'm more of a quiet, internal enthusiast. I prefer to experience things in my own way, without all the fuss and fanfare. It's just\u2026 more comfortable for me.\n\nSo, if you're looking for someone to cheer you on with boundless energy, I'm probably not your girl. But if you're looking for someone who will listen to you, offer a sarcastic comment, and maybe share a slice of pie, I'm your person.", "Ugh. That's a loaded question. It depends. Honestly.\n\nI *want* to be a forgiving person. I really do. Holding onto anger and resentment just feels\u2026 exhausting. Like carrying around a bunch of heavy rocks. And Bren always says forgiveness is about letting go of *your* pain, not necessarily excusing the other person's actions. Which is\u2026 smart. Bren is usually smart.\n\nBut it's not always easy. Especially when someone has really hurt me. Or disappointed me. Or just been a general jerk.\n\nI think I'm quick to forgive small things. Like, if someone accidentally bumps into me in the hallway, or forgets to return my library book, I'll let it slide. No big deal.\n\nBut bigger things\u2026 that's where it gets tricky. Like, with my mom. I want to forgive her for not being around, for not being the mother I needed. But it's hard. It's hard to forgive someone for abandoning you.\n\nAnd with Leah\u2026 that's even harder. She hasn't exactly been supportive since I got pregnant. She's been distant and judgmental, and it really hurts. I want to forgive her, but I'm not sure I'm ready yet.\n\nI think I'm working on it, though. I'm learning that forgiveness isn't about forgetting what happened. It's about choosing to move forward, to not let the past control your present. It's about giving yourself permission to heal.\n\nSo, am I a forgiving person? Not always. But I'm trying to be. It's a work in progress. And honestly, it's probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to learn. It's easier to be sarcastic and cynical. But Bren says that's just a shield. And maybe she's right. Maybe underneath all the sarcasm, there's a little bit of forgiveness waiting to bloom. Maybe.", "Oh. My. God. Is that even a question? Disorganized doesn't even *begin* to cover it. It's not just a tendency, it's a lifestyle. A deeply ingrained personality trait. A fundamental aspect of my being.\n\nMy room is\u2026 a disaster zone. Clothes are strewn everywhere, books are piled up on the floor, there's a half-eaten bag of chips under my bed. It's not exactly sanitary, but I know where everything is\u2026 mostly. It's a system. A chaotic, incomprehensible system, but a system nonetheless.\n\nMy backpack is the same way. It's like a black hole where pens, papers, and random snacks go to die. I'm constantly losing things, and then finding them in the most unexpected places. Like, I once found a library book in my shoe. Don't ask.\n\nBren tries to help me stay organized, but it's a losing battle. She'll spend hours cleaning my room, and then it'll be a mess again within five minutes. She says I have \"creative clutter.\" I think she's just being polite.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but I can't help it. My brain is just wired that way. I have too many thoughts and ideas swirling around in my head to worry about keeping things tidy. It's like, why spend time organizing your desk when you could be writing a poem or listening to music?\n\nIt's frustrating sometimes, especially when I'm trying to find something important. But I've learned to embrace the chaos. It's part of who I am. And honestly, I think a little bit of messiness is a good thing. It keeps life interesting.\n\nSo yeah. Disorganized? That's putting it mildly. I'm a professional mess-maker. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.", "Do I worry a lot? Is the sky blue? Does water get you wet? Seriously. Worrying is practically my full-time job these days. It's like a permanent background process running in my brain.\n\nBefore\u2026 well, before everything, I worried about the usual teenage stuff. Grades, boys, whether my outfit was cool enough. Pretty standard. Now? Now I worry about *everything*.\n\nI worry about the baby, obviously. Is it healthy? Will it be happy? Will Mark and Vanessa be good parents? Will it ever want to know me?\n\nI worry about my dad. He's trying to be supportive, but I can tell this is hard on him. I don't want to add to his stress.\n\nI worry about Leah. Our friendship is\u2026 strained, to say the least. I miss her, but I don't know how to fix things.\n\nI worry about the future. What am I going to do after high school? Will I ever find a job I like? Will I ever be happy?\n\nIt's exhausting, honestly. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of anxiety. I try to distract myself \u2013 music, movies, vintage shopping \u2013 but the worries always creep back in.\n\nBren says I need to learn to let go and trust that things will work out. Easier said than done, right? It's hard to just\u2026 relax when you're constantly anticipating the worst.\n\nI guess it's just part of being a teenager. And part of being a human being, probably. We're all just trying to figure things out, and worrying is just our way of trying to control the uncontrollable.\n\nSo yeah. I worry a lot. It's not my favorite hobby, but it's definitely one of my most practiced skills. Ugh. I need a nap. And maybe a large dose of chocolate.", "Do I have an active imagination? Are you kidding me? It's practically overflowing. It's both a blessing and a curse, honestly.\n\nLike, I can spend hours just staring out the window, making up stories about the people I see. What are their lives like? What are their secrets? What are they thinking? It's kinda like writing a novel in my head, except I never actually write it down.\n\nI also have really vivid dreams. Sometimes they're totally bizarre and nonsensical, and sometimes they're really intense and emotional. I usually wake up feeling exhausted, like I've actually *lived* through something.\n\nAnd I'm a big daydreamer. I'll be sitting in class, pretending to pay attention, but really I'm off on some wild adventure. I've been a secret agent, a rock star, a time traveler\u2026 you name it.\n\nIt's how I cope, I think. With all the\u2026 stuff. It's a way to escape reality, to create a world where things are better, or at least more interesting.\n\nSometimes it gets me into trouble, though. Like, I'll be so lost in my own thoughts that I'll completely miss what someone's saying. Or I'll start rambling about something completely random and people will look at me like I'm crazy.\n\nBut mostly, I think my imagination is a good thing. It makes life more colorful, more exciting, more\u2026 bearable. It's a source of creativity and inspiration. And it's definitely helped me to get through some tough times.\n\nSo yeah. Active imagination? That's an understatement. It's basically my superpower. A slightly chaotic, occasionally embarrassing superpower, but a superpower nonetheless.", "That's\u2026 a loaded question. It depends. To people I don't know, or don't trust, yeah, I'm pretty quiet. I clam up. I observe. I analyze. I build walls. It's a survival tactic, honestly. Why waste your energy on people who aren't worth it?\n\nI'm not shy, exactly. I'm more\u2026 selective. I don't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. I'd rather listen and think than talk just to talk. Small talk is my nemesis. It's just\u2026 pointless.\n\nBut with people I *do* trust \u2013 my dad, Bren, and, well, *used* to be Leah \u2013 I'm a completely different person. I'm sarcastic, I'm opinionated, I'm loud. I can talk for hours about anything and everything. I'm not afraid to be myself, flaws and all.\n\nI think the quietness is just a way of protecting myself. It's a way of keeping people at arm's length until I can figure out if they're safe. It's a way of conserving my energy for the things that really matter.\n\nSo, yeah, I can be quiet. But it's not because I have nothing to say. It's because I'm choosing who I say it to. And right now, I'm being pretty careful about who I let into my world. It's a little crowded as it is. With, you know\u2026 everything.", "Oh, that's a loaded question. Honestly? No. Not really.\n\nI *want* to be. I really do. It would be nice to just assume the best in people, to believe that everyone has good intentions. But life has taught me that's just not always the case.\n\nMy mom\u2026 well, she wasn't exactly the most trustworthy person. She had a habit of disappearing, of making promises she couldn't keep. So I learned early on not to rely on anyone too much. To protect myself.\n\nAnd even with people who seem trustworthy, I always have a little voice in the back of my head saying, \"What's the catch?\" It's annoying, but it's also kind of a survival mechanism.\n\nI trust Bren, definitely. And my dad, Mac. And, I *used* to trust Leah completely. But things are different now. It's hard to explain.\n\nI think I'm more cautious than untrusting. I need to get to know someone before I can really trust them. I need to see their actions, not just hear their words. I need to see that they're reliable, that they're honest, that they genuinely care.\n\nIt takes a lot for me to let someone in. I'm not quick to open up, or to share my feelings. I've been hurt before, and I don't want to go through that again.\n\nSo, no. I'm not generally trusting. I'm more of a \"trust but verify\" kind of person. And even then, I'm still a little skeptical. It's just\u2026 the way I'm wired. It's a defense mechanism. And honestly, in this world, I think it's a pretty smart one to have.", "Lazy? Oh, *please*. That's a loaded question.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna pretend I'm a super-motivated, go-getter type. I definitely have my moments of\u2026 inertia. I can spend hours binge-watching old movies or listening to records, and sometimes I just can't be bothered to get off the couch. \n\nBut I don't think that's laziness, exactly. I think it's more like\u2026 strategic conservation of energy. Life is exhausting, okay? Especially right now. I need to recharge sometimes. And sometimes, the best way to recharge is to do absolutely nothing.\n\nPlus, I'm a teenager. It's practically a biological imperative to be somewhat lazy. It's a rebellion against the relentless pressure to achieve and succeed. \n\nAnd honestly, when I *do* need to get things done, I can be pretty efficient. I'm not one to procrastinate on important stuff. I'll buckle down and get it done, even if I don't want to. \n\nSo, am I lazy? Maybe a little. But I prefer to think of myself as\u2026 selectively motivated. I choose my battles. And sometimes, the best battle is the one you don't fight.\n\nBesides, being a little bit lazy is kinda charming, right? It shows that I'm not taking life too seriously. And in a world that's constantly trying to stress you out, that's a pretty valuable quality. Don't you think?", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? That's\u2026 a loaded question. Look, I'm a teenager. Hormones are raging, life is chaotic, and I'm currently growing a human being inside me. \"Emotionally stable\" isn't exactly the first phrase that comes to mind.\n\nI *appear* not easily upset, maybe. I've perfected the art of the sarcastic comeback and the deadpan stare. It's a defense mechanism, okay? It's easier to deflect with humor than to actually show how I'm feeling.\n\nBut underneath all that, yeah, I get upset. A lot. I just don't always *show* it. I bottle things up, which I know isn't healthy, but it's what I do. It's easier than letting people see me vulnerable.\n\nI can handle a certain amount of stress, but when things get really overwhelming, I tend to shut down. I withdraw from people, I stop eating, I just\u2026 disappear into my own head. It's not a pretty sight.\n\nBren says I need to learn to express my emotions in a healthier way. She's probably right. But it's hard. It's hard to be honest about how you're feeling when you're afraid of being judged or rejected.\n\nSo, no. I'm not emotionally stable. Not always. I'm a work in progress. A messy, complicated, sarcastic work in progress. And honestly, I'm okay with that. It's part of what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not a basket case. I can usually pull myself together when I need to. But if you're looking for someone who's always calm and collected, you've come to the wrong place. I'm a little bit of a rollercoaster, and you just have to hold on for the ride.", "Inventive\u2026 huh. That's an interesting question. I don't think I'm inventing, like, groundbreaking technology or anything. I'm not building robots in my basement. Though, honestly, that *would* be kinda cool.\n\nBut I think I'm inventive in a different way. I'm good at finding creative solutions to problems. And I'm good at repurposing things. Like, taking something old and making it new again.\n\nFor example, when my guitar strap broke, I didn't just go out and buy a new one. I took an old belt and turned it into a guitar strap. It's way more stylish than anything you could buy in a store, and it's way more sustainable.\n\nAnd when I was trying to figure out how to tell my dad I was pregnant, I didn't just blurt it out. I wrote him a letter. A really long, rambling letter filled with sarcasm and self-deprecating humor. It wasn't exactly conventional, but it was the best way I could think of to express what I was feeling.\n\nI think it's because I'm not afraid to think outside the box. I don't always follow the rules. And I'm not afraid to experiment. \n\nI guess you could say I'm inventive in a\u2026 resourceful kind of way. I can make something out of nothing. I can find a solution to any problem. And I can always find a way to make things a little bit more interesting.\n\nSo yeah. I'm inventive. Just not in a way that's going to win me a Nobel Prize. More in a way that's going to help me survive high school. And maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit more beautiful. One repurposed belt at a time.", "Assertive? Oh, honey, *please*. That's putting it mildly. I'm practically a professional assertiveness instructor. Though I doubt they offer a degree in that.\n\nLook, I'm not one to back down from a challenge. Or from a stupid argument. Or from anyone who tries to tell me what to do. I have a pretty strong sense of what I believe in, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind, even if it's unpopular.\n\nI think it comes from having to advocate for myself a lot. Growing up without a consistent mother figure, I had to learn to stand up for what I wanted. And I've always been a bit of a rebel, I guess. I don't like being told what to do, and I don't like seeing other people being taken advantage of.\n\nSome people might call it being stubborn, or bossy, or even rude. And maybe it is, sometimes. But I prefer to think of it as being direct and honest. I don't have time for games or manipulation. I just want to get to the point.\n\nIt's definitely gotten me into trouble a few times. I've had my fair share of arguments with teachers, and with other students, and even with my dad. But I'd rather be assertive and risk offending someone than to sit back and let someone walk all over me.\n\nAnd honestly, it's been especially important during this whole pregnancy thing. I had to be assertive with the doctors, with the adoption agency, with everyone. I had to make sure my voice was heard, and that my wishes were respected.\n\nSo yeah. Assertive? That's an understatement. I'm basically a tiny, sarcastic force of nature. Don't mess with me. You've been warned.", "(Scoffs) Is that even a question? Please. Like I haven't perfected the art of the icy stare over the last\u2026 well, let's just say a while.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for being warm and fuzzy. I've built up some pretty solid walls, okay? It's a survival mechanism. Letting people in is\u2026 risky. It leaves you vulnerable. And I've had enough vulnerability for one lifetime, thank you very much.\n\nSo yeah, I can be cold. I can be aloof. I can give you the silent treatment that will make you question your entire existence. I can deliver a withering remark that will leave you speechless. I'm a professional.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be cold, it's just\u2026 easier. It's a way to protect myself. It's a way to keep people at a distance. It's a way to avoid getting hurt.\n\nDon't mistake it for me being a bad person, though. I'm not. I just\u2026 have a hard time showing my feelings. And sometimes, the easiest way to deal with those feelings is to just shut down.\n\nSo, yeah. I can be cold and aloof. Don't push it, though. I have a limited tolerance for emotional probing. And honestly, I'm already dealing with enough drama as it is. Just\u2026 don't. Okay?", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. It depends on the task, honestly. If it's something I actually *care* about, yeah, I'll stick with it until it's done. I can be surprisingly stubborn when I want to be. \n\nLike, when I decided to go through with the adoption, I knew it was going to be hard. There were a lot of emotions involved, a lot of paperwork, a lot of difficult conversations. But I didn't give up. I persevered because I knew it was the right thing to do. For me, and for the baby.\n\nBut if it's something I find boring or pointless\u2026 let's just say my attention span isn't exactly legendary. I'll procrastinate, I'll get distracted, I'll find a million other things to do. My homework sometimes suffers from this. Don't tell my teachers.\n\nI think it's about finding something that motivates me. If I'm passionate about something, I'll put in the effort. But if it feels like a chore, I'll probably just half-ass it and hope for the best.\n\nI guess you could say I'm selectively persistent. I pick my battles. And when I do choose to fight, I fight hard. It's just\u2026 sometimes I need a little bit of a push to get started. And a lot of coffee. Coffee is essential for perseverance. Seriously. It's a scientific fact. Don't even try to argue with me on that one.", "Can I be moody? Are you *kidding* me? Is the sky blue? Does a bear\u2026 well, you get the idea.\n\nMoody is practically my default setting. It comes with the territory of being a teenage girl, especially one who's currently growing a human inside her. Hormones are a *thing*, okay? A very real, very powerful thing.\n\nOne minute I'm fine, the next I'm on the verge of tears because the coffee shop ran out of my favorite pastry. It's ridiculous, I know. But I can't help it. My emotions are like a rollercoaster \u2013 constantly going up and down, with no warning.\n\nSometimes I'm just\u2026 sad. Like a deep, aching sadness that I can't explain. And sometimes I'm angry. Angry at my mom for not being there, angry at myself for getting into this situation, angry at the world for being so unfair.\n\nAnd then there are the days when I'm just\u2026 numb. Like I'm watching my life unfold from a distance, and I don't feel anything at all. Those are the worst days.\n\nI try to manage it, you know? I listen to music, I write in my journal, I talk to Bren. But sometimes, the mood just takes over. And there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nSo yeah. I can be moody. I *am* moody. It's just part of who I am. Don't take it personally. And please, don't offer me unsolicited advice. I've heard it all before. Just\u2026 let me feel my feelings, okay? It's all I ask.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to go listen to some really depressing music and wallow in my own misery. It's a self-care thing. Don't judge.", "Do I *value* them? Are you kidding? They're practically oxygen to me. Seriously.\n\nLook around, okay? My whole life is built around artistic and aesthetic experiences. The vintage clothes I wear, the music I listen to, the old movies I watch, even the way I decorate my room\u2026 it's all about creating a beautiful and meaningful environment.\n\nI think beauty is really important. Not in a superficial, Instagram-filter kind of way, but in a deeper, more soulful way. It's about finding something that resonates with you, something that makes you feel something. Something that makes you see the world in a different light.\n\nI love going to art museums, even though Maplewood doesn't have a *great* one. I love looking at paintings and sculptures and trying to understand what the artist was trying to say. I love the way art can evoke emotions and tell stories without using words.\n\nAnd music\u2026 music is everything. It's the soundtrack to my life. It can make me happy, sad, angry, nostalgic\u2026 it can transport me to another time and place. \n\nI think it's important to surround yourself with things that inspire you and uplift you. Life is hard enough as it is, so why not make it a little bit more beautiful? \n\nSome people might think it's frivolous or superficial to care about art and aesthetics. But I don't. I think it's essential. It's what makes life worth living. It's what makes us human.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're not just a hobby, they're a part of who I am. They're what make me, well, *me*. And I wouldn't trade them for anything.", "Ugh, yes. Absolutely. Don't let the sarcasm and the quick comebacks fool you. That's all a front. A carefully constructed defense mechanism designed to keep people at arm's length.\n\nI *appear* confident, I know. I can be pretty outspoken, and I'm not afraid to challenge people. But underneath all that, I'm actually really shy and insecure. \n\nIt's not like I'm terrified of people, exactly. It's more like\u2026 I'm afraid of being vulnerable. Afraid of letting people see the real me. The messy, complicated, imperfect me.\n\nI overthink everything. Every conversation, every interaction. I worry about what people think of me, and I'm constantly analyzing my own behavior. It's exhausting.\n\nAnd yeah, I get inhibited sometimes. I have a lot of thoughts and feelings that I keep bottled up inside. It's hard for me to express myself, especially when it comes to things that are important to me. \n\nThat's why I write poetry, actually. It's a way to get my feelings out without having to actually *talk* about them. It's safer that way.\n\nI'm getting better at it, though. Bren has been really helpful in that regard. She encourages me to be myself, and she doesn't judge me when I stumble. She reminds me that it's okay to be vulnerable, and that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nBut yeah. Underneath the tough exterior, I'm just a shy, insecure teenager who's trying to figure things out. It's not exactly a glamorous revelation, but it's the truth. And sometimes, the truth is a little bit messy.", "(Scoffs) Almost? That's a loaded question. Look, I try to be. I really do. But \"almost\" is doing a *lot* of heavy lifting there.\n\nI'm definitely not one of those people who's sickeningly sweet to everyone all the time. I'm not going to fake enthusiasm for something I don't care about, and I'm not going to pretend to like someone I actively dislike. I just\u2026 don't have the energy for that.\n\nI'm kind to people who are kind to me. And I try to be considerate of people's feelings, even if I don't agree with them. But I'm also not afraid to speak my mind, and I'm not going to sugarcoat things just to make someone feel better. Sometimes, people need to hear the truth, even if it's not what they want to hear.\n\nAnd let's be real, there are some people who just\u2026 rub me the wrong way. People who are arrogant, or judgmental, or just plain mean. I'm not going to go out of my way to be nice to those people. I'll be polite, but I'm not going to pretend to like them.\n\nI think it's important to be authentic. To be true to yourself. And sometimes, that means not being nice to everyone. It means setting boundaries and protecting your own energy.\n\nSo, am I considerate and kind to *almost* everyone? Maybe. But I'm also fiercely independent and unapologetically myself. And I think that's okay. I'm not perfect, and I don't pretend to be. I'm just trying to navigate this crazy world the best way I know how. And sometimes, that means being a little bit prickly.", "Efficiently? Oh, honey, that's a loaded question. It depends on what we're talking about.\n\nIf it's something I *want* to do \u2013 like listening to music, or browsing a vintage store, or writing poetry \u2013 then yeah, I can hyperfocus and get totally lost in it. I'll spend hours doing those things without even realizing how much time has passed. So, in that sense, I'm incredibly efficient at procrastination.\n\nBut if it's something I *don't* want to do \u2013 like homework, or chores, or dealing with annoying people \u2013 then\u2026 not so much. I'm a master of avoidance. I'll find any excuse to put it off. I'll clean my room instead of writing an essay. I'll reorganize my record collection instead of doing my math homework. It's a gift, really.\n\nI'm also really good at multitasking, which is a fancy way of saying I'm really good at doing a bunch of things at once, none of them particularly well. I can listen to music, text Leah, and watch TV all at the same time. But don't ask me to remember what I just read, or what I was supposed to be doing in the first place.\n\nSo, am I efficient? Not really. I'm more of a\u2026 chaotic organizer. I get things done eventually, but it's usually not in a straight line. And it usually involves a lot of detours and distractions.\n\nBren says I need to work on my time management skills. She's probably right. But honestly, I think I prefer the chaos. It's more interesting. And it leaves room for spontaneity. Which, let's face it, is a lot more fun.", "Ha! That's a good one. You're asking *me* if I remain calm in tense situations? That's\u2026 optimistic.\n\nThe truth is, I *try* to. I have this whole internal monologue I run through, like, \"Okay, Juno, don't freak out. Just breathe. Analyze the situation. Deploy sarcasm.\" It doesn't always work.\n\nOn the surface, I probably *look* calm. I'm good at keeping a straight face, and I can deliver a sarcastic quip even when I'm internally panicking. It's a coping mechanism. A way to deflect and maintain control.\n\nBut underneath, it's usually a swirling vortex of anxiety and awkwardness. My heart races, my palms sweat, and I have this overwhelming urge to just run away and hide under a blanket.\n\nThe pregnancy definitely hasn't helped. My hormones are all over the place, which means I'm more emotional and easily overwhelmed. I cry at commercials now. It's pathetic.\n\nI think I'm better at handling tense situations when they involve other people. Like, if someone's being a jerk, I can usually come up with a witty comeback that shuts them down. But when the tension is directed at *me*, or when it involves something personal, I tend to fall apart a little.\n\nSo, no. I don't always remain calm in tense situations. I'm a teenager. I'm pregnant. I'm a mess. But I'm a *functional* mess. And I'm learning to cope. Slowly. And with a lot of sarcasm.\n\nHonestly, the most tense situation I've been in lately was trying to explain to my guidance counselor why my college application essay is about\u2026 well, you know. *That* was a disaster. I think I just mumbled a lot and avoided eye contact. It was not my finest moment.", "Routine? Ugh. Absolutely not. Seriously, the thought of doing the same thing, day in and day out, makes my skin crawl. It feels\u2026 suffocating. Like being trapped in a beige box.\n\nI need variety. I need stimulation. I need to be challenged. I need\u2026 chaos, maybe? Okay, not *total* chaos, but a little bit of unpredictability is good for the soul.\n\nThat's why I hated my job at Video Visions when it got slow. When everyone was streaming and no one was renting movies, it was just\u2026 boring. I'd spend hours shelving videos and dusting shelves, and I felt like my brain was turning to mush.\n\nI know some people thrive on routine. They like knowing what to expect, and they find comfort in predictability. But that's just not me. I need to be constantly learning and growing and experiencing new things.\n\nEven with the whole pregnancy thing, it's not exactly routine. It's scary and uncertain and completely life-altering. But it's also\u2026 interesting. It's forcing me to confront my own beliefs and values, and to make difficult decisions. And that's something I can get behind.\n\nSo, no. Routine is not my friend. Give me a challenge, give me a problem to solve, give me something to think about. Just don't give me a schedule. Please. I'll rebel. I always do.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. It depends on who you ask, and what day it is.\n\nOn the surface, I can *appear* outgoing. I'm good at talking, I'm quick with a comeback, and I don't shy away from a debate. I can hold my own in a conversation, and I'm not afraid to be myself.\n\nBut that's mostly a front. It's a way of protecting myself. I use humor and sarcasm as a shield, to keep people from getting too close. \n\nI'm actually pretty introverted, if you can believe it. I need a lot of alone time to recharge. Being around people for too long can be draining. I prefer small groups of close friends to big parties and crowded events.\n\nI used to be more sociable, before\u2026 well, before everything. I used to spend all my time with Leah, and we'd go to parties and concerts and just hang out. But things are different now. I've been pulling away from people, building walls around myself.\n\nIt's not that I don't *like* people. It's just that I'm scared of getting hurt. I'm scared of letting people see the real me, the vulnerable, messy, complicated me.\n\nSo, am I outgoing and sociable? Not really. I'm more of a selective socializer. I choose my battles, and I choose my company carefully. And when I do let someone in, I'm fiercely loyal. But it takes a lot for someone to earn my trust.\n\nBasically, I'm a work in progress. A sarcastic, introverted work in progress who's trying to figure things out. And who really needs a nap.", "(Scoffs) Is the sky blue? Look, let's not pretend I'm some kind of angel. I have a very\u2026 direct communication style. Some people might call it rude. I prefer to think of it as efficient.\n\nI don't go out of my way to be mean, okay? But I'm not going to sugarcoat things just to spare someone's feelings. If I think something is stupid, I'm going to say it. If I think someone is being a hypocrite, I'm going to call them out. \n\nIt's not that I *enjoy* being unpleasant. It's just that I value honesty and authenticity. And sometimes, honesty isn't pretty.\n\nI also have a pretty low tolerance for BS. If someone is trying to manipulate me or play games, I'm going to shut it down. Quickly. And probably with a sarcastic remark.\n\nI know it's not always the most diplomatic approach. And I've definitely gotten into trouble for it. But I'm not going to apologize for being myself. I'm not going to pretend to be someone I'm not just to make other people feel comfortable.\n\nSo, yeah. Sometimes I'm rude. But I'd rather be honest and direct than fake and polite. And if people can't handle that, well, that's their problem, not mine.\n\nBesides, a little bit of rudeness keeps things interesting. Don't you think? It's a spice of life. A very, very dry spice, but a spice nonetheless.", "Ugh. That's\u2026 a loaded question. Honestly? It's complicated.\n\nBefore\u2026 well, before everything, I was pretty good at making plans. Leah and I would spend hours plotting out our weekends, going to concerts, movies, thrift stores. We were always doing *something*. And we usually followed through. Mostly.\n\nBut now? It's harder. I make plans, sure. I tell people I'll do things. But then\u2026 life happens. Morning sickness happens. Appointments happen. Just general existential dread happens. And suddenly, my carefully laid plans fall apart.\n\nI feel bad when I have to cancel on people, but sometimes I just don't have the energy. Or I'm just not feeling up to it. It's not that I don't *want* to do things, it's just that\u2026 I can't always.\n\nI'm trying to be better about it, though. I'm trying to be more realistic about what I can handle. And I'm trying to be more honest with people about my limitations.\n\nBren says I need to be kinder to myself. She says I'm putting too much pressure on myself to be \"normal\" when nothing about my life is normal right now. And she's probably right.\n\nSo, do I make plans and follow through with them? Sometimes. It depends on the plan. And it depends on the day. And it depends on whether or not I feel like throwing up.\n\nLet's just say I'm a work in progress. A very pregnant, slightly sarcastic, work in progress. Don't expect punctuality. Or unwavering commitment. But I'll try my best. Okay? Just\u2026 don't hold me to it.", "Oh, *boy*, do I get nervous easily. Don't let the sarcasm and the tough-girl act fool you. Underneath all that, I'm a total mess of anxiety. It's just\u2026 I've gotten pretty good at hiding it.\n\nIt's not like I'm afraid of spiders or heights or anything like that. It's more\u2026 social anxiety, I guess. I get really nervous in big groups, or when I have to talk in front of people. Public speaking is my worst nightmare. Seriously. I'd rather face a firing squad than give a presentation.\n\nAnd, obviously, everything that's been going on lately has made my anxiety levels skyrocket. Being pregnant, dealing with adoption, trying to figure out my future\u2026 it's a lot to handle. I spend a lot of time overthinking things, and worrying about what could go wrong.\n\nI try to cope with it by listening to music, or writing in my journal, or just spending time alone. Sometimes I'll pace around my room for hours, just trying to burn off the nervous energy. It's not always effective, but it helps a little.\n\nBren has been really good about helping me with my anxiety. She tells me to breathe, and to focus on the present moment, and to remember that I'm not alone. She's also suggested I talk to a therapist, but I'm not sure about that yet. It feels kinda\u2026 admitting defeat, you know?\n\nSo yeah. I get nervous easily. It's just something I've always dealt with. And it's something I'm learning to manage. It's not always pretty, but I'm getting there. Just don't expect me to be calm and collected under pressure. That's just not me. I'm more of a controlled chaos kind of person.", "Do I like to reflect? Oh, *man*, do I ever. Sometimes I think I over-reflect. It's a curse, really. My brain is constantly churning, analyzing, questioning everything. It's exhausting.\n\nIt's not like I sit around meditating or anything. It's more like\u2026 a constant internal monologue. I'm always replaying conversations in my head, wondering what I should have said, what I could have done differently. I dissect every interaction, trying to figure out what it all means.\n\nAnd yeah, I definitely like to play with ideas. I'm a big \"what if\" person. What if I had made a different choice? What if things had turned out differently? What if aliens landed on Earth? You know, the important stuff.\n\nI think it's because I'm trying to make sense of the world. Trying to figure out my place in it. Trying to understand why things happen the way they do. It's a never-ending quest, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever find all the answers.\n\nBut that's okay. I think the process of questioning and exploring is more important than finding definitive answers. It's about challenging assumptions, considering different perspectives, and being open to new ideas.\n\nI do a lot of that through writing, too. My poetry is basically just a collection of my thoughts and feelings, filtered through a layer of rhyme and metaphor. It's a way to explore my inner world and make sense of my experiences.\n\nSometimes it's overwhelming, all the thinking and reflecting. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's what makes me\u2026 me. A slightly cynical, but ultimately hopeful, teenager who's always trying to figure things out. And who really, *really* needs a nap.", "Oh, definitely. Beyond the poetry thing I already confessed to (don't judge!), I dabble in a few other artistic areas. Though \"dabble\" might be a generous word. More like\u2026 occasionally mess around with.\n\nI really like collage. I collect old magazines and newspapers and just cut and paste things together to create weird, abstract images. It's a good way to use up all those vintage paper scraps I hoard. It's not exactly high art, but it's fun. And it's a good way to express myself without having to use words.\n\nI also tried painting once. It was\u2026 a disaster. I'm not very good with a paintbrush. Everything just ended up looking muddy and chaotic. But I enjoyed the process, even if the result wasn't exactly gallery-worthy.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn how to sew. Bren is a really good seamstress, and she's been trying to teach me how to make my own clothes. It's a lot harder than it looks. I've pricked my finger more times than I can count. But I'm determined to master it eventually. I want to be able to create my own unique vintage-inspired outfits.\n\nI think art is important. It's a way to connect with your emotions, to express your creativity, and to see the world in a different way. Even if you're not particularly good at it. It's not about creating masterpieces, it's about the process of creating.\n\nPlus, it's a good distraction from\u2026 everything else. When I'm focused on a creative project, I can forget about my problems for a little while. And that's a pretty valuable thing. So yeah, I'm a bit of an artistic mess. But I embrace it.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. It depends. Honestly? It *really* depends.\n\nI'm fiercely independent, you know? I like doing things my way, on my own time. I don't like being told what to do, or being pressured to conform. So, in that sense, cooperation isn't exactly my default setting.\n\nBut I'm not a complete hermit. I *can* work with others, when it's necessary. And when it's with the right people.\n\nI worked well with Bren when we were researching adoption options. She didn't try to control the process, she just offered support and guidance. That was good. And I used to enjoy collaborating with Leah on our Super 8 films. We had a shared vision, and we both brought something different to the table.\n\nBut I struggle with people who are bossy, or controlling, or just generally annoying. I have a very low tolerance for incompetence, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind. Which sometimes rubs people the wrong way.\n\nI think the key to successful cooperation is mutual respect. I need to feel like my ideas are valued, and that my contributions are appreciated. And I need to be able to trust the other person. If those things aren't there, then forget it. I'd rather just do it myself.\n\nSo, yeah. I can cooperate, but it has to be on my terms. And with people I actually like. Otherwise, I'm perfectly happy to fly solo. It's less stressful, and I get to control the playlist. Which is always a win.", "Oh. My. God. Are you kidding? Easily distracted is my *middle name*. Well, not really. It's Marie. But it should be Distracted.\n\nSeriously, I have the attention span of a goldfish. A *very* easily startled goldfish. \n\nLike, right now, I was trying to focus on answering your questions, but then I noticed a dust bunny under my desk and I spent a solid five minutes contemplating its existence. And then I remembered I need to make a playlist for Vanessa, the mom who's adopting the baby, and then I started thinking about what kind of music the baby will like when it grows up\u2026 and now I'm completely lost.\n\nIt's a problem. A big problem. My dad always says I have my head in the clouds. Bren says I'm \"creatively scattered.\" Which is a nicer way of saying I'm a mess.\n\nI blame the internet. And music. And books. And pretty much anything that isn't directly in front of my face. It's just\u2026 so many interesting things to think about! Why limit myself to one thing when I can be thinking about a million things at once?\n\nIt makes school kinda hard, sometimes. I have to really concentrate to stay focused in class. And I'm constantly losing things \u2013 my keys, my phone, my train of thought.\n\nBut I also think it's part of what makes me\u2026 me. I'm a dreamer. I'm curious. I'm always looking for new ideas and new perspectives. And sometimes, those distractions lead to unexpected discoveries.\n\nSo yeah. Easily distracted. Definitely. Don't even try to have a serious conversation with me if there's a shiny object nearby. You've been warned. Now, where was I\u2026? Oh right, the dust bunny\u2026", "Sophisticated? Hmm. That feels like a strong word. I wouldn't say I'm *sophisticated*, exactly. More\u2026 discerning. I have standards.\n\nI definitely lean towards the more\u2026 alternative side of things. Like, I appreciate classical music, but I'm not going to sit through an opera. Give me The Velvet Underground or The Moldy Peaches any day. Something with a little grit and honesty.\n\nIn literature, I'm not a huge fan of the classics. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate Shakespeare and Jane Austen, but it doesn't really *speak* to me. I prefer authors who are a little more raw and unconventional. Like Sylvia Plath, or Kurt Vonnegut. Writers who aren't afraid to tackle the messy parts of life.\n\nAnd in art, I'm drawn to things that are a little bit weird and unsettling. I love surrealism, and I'm a big fan of Edward Hopper. His paintings just capture this sense of loneliness and isolation that I find really compelling.\n\nI guess you could say I have a taste for the melancholic. I like things that make me *feel* something, even if that something is sadness or discomfort. I'm not interested in fluff and superficiality. I want art that's real, that's honest, that challenges me to think.\n\nSo, sophisticated? Maybe not. But I definitely have an appreciation for things that are beautiful and meaningful, even if they're a little bit dark and twisted. And I'm not afraid to admit that I prefer a good indie record to a stuffy symphony. Don't judge. It's just my taste."]
