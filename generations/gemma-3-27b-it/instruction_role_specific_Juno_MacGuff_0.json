["Ugh, okay, so like, where do I even *begin* with that? It wasn't exactly a spontaneous decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, cool, a baby! Let's just...give it away!\" That would be seriously messed up.\n\nIt was more...realistic. Paulie Bleeker \u2013 sweet, oblivious Paulie \u2013 and I, we were, like, *fifteen*. Fifteen! We were still figuring out what kind of pizza we liked, let alone how to raise a human being. I mean, I can barely keep my grades up and maintain a decent level of ironic detachment, how am I supposed to handle diapers and stuff? \n\nAnd honestly? I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready. Not even close. I wanted to finish school, maybe go to college, figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life. I didn't want my life to be...over before it even really started. \n\nSo, it wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting something *better* for the baby. A life with parents who were actually prepared, who had their stuff together. Mark and Vanessa Loring, they were...good people. They *wanted* a baby. They could give it everything I couldn't. \n\nIt was a hard decision, obviously. Still is, sometimes. But it felt like the most responsible thing to do. And honestly? Sometimes the most responsible thing isn't the easiest. It just *is*. You get me?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, *love*. Everyone's always going on about it, right? Like it's this big, sparkly thing that solves all your problems. Honestly? It's messier than that. Way messier. I mean, I thought Paulie Bleeker was\u2026 okay. He was a good listener, I guess, and he didn't judge my obsession with horror movies. But that wasn't, like, *love* love. It was comfortable. And sometimes comfortable is good, but it's not exactly fireworks.\n\nWhat I learned is that love isn't just about the romantic stuff. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if that means letting them go. Which, yeah, was kinda the whole point of the baby situation. It wasn't that I didn't *care* about the little dude, it was that I knew I wasn't ready to give him the life he deserved. And that took a whole lot of\u2026 not fun thinking. \n\nMark and Vanessa, though. *They* showed me a different kind of love. They were already a family, but they were building one in a different way. They were so\u2026 prepared. And genuinely excited. Seeing them, wanting a kid so badly, made me feel okay about my decision. Like I was doing something good, even if it was hard.\n\nAnd responsibility? Oh boy. That's a whole other can of worms. It's not just about, like, remembering to do your homework. It's about facing the consequences of your actions. And let me tell you, accidentally getting pregnant has *consequences*. It forced me to grow up, like, a lot faster than I wanted to. It wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person, and Mark and Vanessa, and even my parents, who were surprisingly\u2026 supportive. \n\nIt's about realizing that your choices affect other people, and that you have to own up to them. It's not glamorous, it's not easy, but it's\u2026 important. And honestly? It's kinda empowering, once you get past the whole \"I messed up big time\" part.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people always ask me that. It's not like I *tried* to be funny while everything was going down, you know? It just\u2026happened. It was kinda a defense mechanism, I guess. Like, if I could make a joke about being pregnant, it felt less\u2026monumental. Less *scary*. \n\nSeriously, imagine trying to navigate high school, a totally unexpected baby situation, and adults constantly treating you like you're made of glass without being able to crack a wise remark. You'd probably just curl up and die. \n\nIt was a way to take the power back, I think. Like, *I* got to control the narrative, even if it was just for a second. I could say something sarcastic and watch people blink, and for a minute, I wasn't just \"the pregnant girl.\" I was just\u2026Juno. The girl who says things.\n\nPlus, let's be real, some of the stuff was just *weird*. You gotta laugh, right? Otherwise, you'd just cry all the time, and nobody wants to see that. It's exhausting. And honestly, Paulie Ruffner was a goldmine of material. Don't tell him I said that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep question right off the bat. Like, seriously? It's not like I *planned* on having an existential crisis alongside a burgeoning belly, you know? But yeah, it totally shaped everything.\n\nSee, before\u2026 the whole situation\u2026 I was pretty good at being a wall. A sarcastic, movie-quoting wall, but a wall nonetheless. I figured if I just kept things light, kept things funny, nobody would really *look* at me. Like, really *see* me. It was easier that way. Easier to just observe everyone else's drama and comment on it with a perfectly timed quip. \n\nBut then *bam*. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, everyone *was* looking. And I couldn't just deflect with a line about Napoleon Dynamite anymore. It felt\u2026 exposing. And terrifying.\n\nThe vulnerability part? That was the hardest. Admitting I was scared, admitting I didn't have all the answers, admitting I needed help. That's not exactly in the Juno MacGuff handbook, you know? It felt like letting down my guard, and I was convinced everyone would take advantage.\n\nAnd the identity thing\u2026 well, I was trying to figure out who *I* was even *before* the baby. Was I the cynical observer? The aspiring writer? The girl who just wanted to listen to The Moldy Peaches and eat tater tots? Suddenly, all those things felt\u2026 small. Like they weren't enough. I had to figure out who I was going to be *with* this responsibility, and who I wanted to be *after* it was over. \n\nIt wasn't about losing myself, exactly. It was about\u2026 expanding. Like, realizing there was more to me than I thought. And honestly? It was messy. And awkward. And sometimes really, really sad. But it also forced me to grow up, in a way I never expected. \n\nSo yeah, vulnerability and searching for identity? They weren't optional extras. They were, like, the main plot points of the whole thing. And honestly? I think I'm still figuring it out. But at least now I'm okay with admitting that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people always wanna talk about the *hard* parts, right? The whole\u2026situation. But honestly? It wasn't just about *me* being strong. It was about not having to, like, pretend I was when I totally wasn't.\n\nSee, my dad, Paul? He's a pretty quiet guy, mostly into old records and fixing stuff. But he just\u2026 listened. No judgment, no lectures about responsibility, just\u2026listening. And then offering me orange juice. Seriously, orange juice was a major component of getting through things. It's surprisingly comforting.\n\nAnd Bleeker! Oh, Bleeker. He was\u2026 a dork, let's be real. But a *good* dork. He didn't run away screaming, which, honestly, was a low bar, but still. He just kept showing up, trying to be supportive, even when I was being a total grump. He helped me with my music, which was a way to, like, process everything without actually *talking* about it. \n\nThen there's Leah. My best friend. She's\u2026intense. Like, a whirlwind of opinions and eyeliner. But she was the one who actually *made* me think about what I wanted, not just what I *should* do. She didn't sugarcoat anything, which was good, because I definitely needed someone to be brutally honest. \n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa Loring, the couple I chose? They were\u2026different. They weren't trying to *fix* anything, they just wanted to give a kid a good life. Seeing them, seeing how much they wanted this, it made me feel\u2026okay about my decision. Like, it wasn't just me giving something up, it was me *giving* something to people who would really cherish it.\n\nSo yeah, it wasn't about me being some super-powered, independent teenager. It was about having people who let me be messy, let me be scared, and still believed in me. It was about realizing I didn't have to figure everything out on my own. It was about\u2026well, it was about realizing I wasn't alone. And that's a pretty big deal, you know?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, picture this. I'm sitting on the bathroom floor, staring at this little plus sign, and it's... not exactly a party in my pants, you know? It wasn't like in the movies, all dramatic music and gasping. It was more like... a really awkward silence. Like the universe was just waiting for me to process the fact that I'd managed to accomplish something that most people don't even *try* to accomplish until, like, way later in life.\n\nHonestly? My first thought wasn't \"Oh my god, a baby!\" It was more like, \"Well, this complicates things.\" I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about getting my driver's license and whether or not Paulie Bleeker would finally notice my amazing taste in music, not... this. \n\nIt was kinda terrifying, actually. Like, my life had a perfectly good trajectory \u2013 slightly cynical, definitely sarcastic, heading towards a future involving indie films and maybe a career in journalism \u2013 and suddenly there was this giant detour sign. But also... weirdly, not *completely* awful. It was just... a lot. A whole lot. And I knew, even then, that I couldn't just ignore it. I had to figure things out.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, *that* question. It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I announced it with a party favor and a little \"ta-da!\" moment. It kinda...shifted things. Dramatically.\n\nWith my dad, Paul? He was...surprisingly cool. A little quiet at first, mostly just processing, I think. He's a pretty mellow dude, always has been. He started building this elaborate rocking horse, which was...a lot. Like, seriously, it was a *commitment*. It was his way of dealing, I guess. Showing he cared, even if he didn't know *what* to say. It was kinda sweet, actually.\n\nMy stepmom, Bren? She was the one who really stepped up. She's a total earth mother, always has been. She didn't judge, which was huge. She just...helped. With appointments, with, you know, *everything*. She even started knitting baby stuff, which was a little intense, but I appreciated the effort. She was the one who kept me from completely spiraling, honestly.\n\nAnd then there's Leah. My best friend. That was...rough. She was mad. Like, *really* mad. She felt betrayed, I think, that I didn't tell her sooner. It took a while for us to get back on track. A lot of awkward silences and forced smiles. But we did. Eventually. Because that's what best friends do, right? They yell at you, then they forgive you, then they help you pick out baby names even though you're giving the baby *up*. It's complicated.\n\nIt kinda sorted out who was really in my corner, you know? Some people just...disappeared. Which, honestly, was probably for the best. It was a weird test, I guess. A really, really weird test. It made me realize who I could actually count on, and who was just along for the ride when things were easy. \n\nIt wasn't fun, not even a little bit. But it definitely...changed things. For the better, I think. Eventually.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so, coping. That's a *big* word, right? Like, it implies I had some master plan or something. Honestly? Mostly I just...talked. A lot. And not, like, deep, meaningful talks all the time. More like, sarcastic observations about the absurdity of it all. It was a good defense mechanism, I think. If you can make fun of something, it loses some of its power to freak you out.\n\nBleaker, though, was just...feeling really alone, even when people *were* around. Like, everyone else was still figuring out what college to apply to and I was over here contemplating Lamaze classes. It felt\u2026off-kilter. \n\nPaulie Bleeker was surprisingly good, actually. He didn't try to fix things, you know? He just...*was*. And Leah, my stepmom? She was a lifesaver. She didn't treat me like a screw-up, which was a huge relief. She just...helped me figure out what *I* wanted. \n\nAnd then there was the music. Lots and lots of music. Helped drown out the, uh, existential dread. \n\nIt wasn't easy, obviously. There were days I just wanted to curl up in a ball and pretend none of it was happening. But you kinda just...keep going. One foot in front of the other. And a whole lot of cynicism to get you through. It's weird, but even though it was scary, it also kinda...forced me to grow up. Which, honestly, is probably a good thing, even if it's totally inconvenient.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You wanna talk about *that*? It's not exactly a fun topic for casual conversation, you know? But fine. Let's unpack this.\n\nHavenbrooke... that place was *creepy*. Like, seriously, aggressively pro-life creepy. All those pictures of, like, perfectly formed little toes and stuff? It felt less like a clinic and more like a guilt trip factory. And the lady there? She kept calling it a \"little person.\" A *little person*! I hadn't even decided anything yet and I already felt like I was being judged harder than in history class.\n\nWomen Now, though? It was...different. It felt real. Like, they understood it wasn't some easy decision, and they weren't gonna try and lay a bunch of emotional baggage on me. It was straightforward. They explained everything, answered my questions without making me feel like a total idiot, and didn't try to shame me for even *thinking* about it. \n\nPlus, honestly? Havenbrooke smelled like old lady perfume and regret. Women Now smelled like...well, like a doctor's office, which is already a step up. \n\nIt wasn't about wanting an abortion, necessarily. It was about wanting to be treated like a person, not a problem. And Women Now did that. It just felt...less awful. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain when you haven't been stared down by a picture of a tiny hand.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? That's the *first* thing you ask? It's not like I planned a whole production around it, you know? It just\u2026 happened. Bleeker and I were hanging out after school, listening to The Moldy Peaches \u2013 which, in retrospect, is kinda ironic, don't you think? \u2013 and we were both feeling\u2026 I don't know, kinda connected. He's a sweet guy, Paulie. A little clueless, maybe, but sweet. \n\nHonestly, I think we were both just trying to figure stuff out. We were both virgins, which, looking back, was probably not the smartest move. It wasn't like some grand romantic gesture or anything. It was\u2026 impulsive. A moment. And then, well, a moment turned into a whole *thing*. \n\nIt's not something I regret, exactly. It led to\u2026 well, it led to everything. But it wasn't some deeply thought-out decision, if that's what you're getting at. Sometimes things just *happen*, you know? And then you gotta deal with the consequences. Which, in my case, involved a lot of pregnancy tests and a whole lot of thinking.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, look, don't get me wrong, he's... a good kid. Seriously. Like, genuinely sweet. And he plays guitar, which is, you know, marginally cool. But \"feelings\" about Bleeker are... complicated. \n\nIt started as, like, a one-time thing, right? A momentary lapse in judgment fueled by orange juice and a shared love of bad horror movies. And then *bam*, pregnant. Not exactly the romantic comedy scenario I was picturing.\n\nHe tried, though. He *really* tried to be all supportive and mature. Which was... endearing, in a slightly awkward, \"trying-too-hard\" kind of way. He's just... not exactly brimming with opinions, you know? It's like pulling teeth to get him to say what he *actually* thinks. \n\nI think, at first, I kinda liked that he wasn't all over me, demanding things. It was a relief, honestly. But then you realize you kinda *want* someone to, like, *feel* something strongly. \n\nSo, do I have \"feelings\"? It's not like a fireworks-and-slow-dancing kind of thing. It's more... a quiet appreciation for a genuinely decent person who was thrown into a really weird situation with me. And a little bit of pity, maybe? He's a good egg, Bleeker. Just... not *my* egg, if that makes any sense.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, everyone always asks that. It's not like I *wanted* to, you know? It's not like I was strolling through life thinking, \"Oh, wouldn't it be *fun* to give a baby to someone else?\" That's...weird.\n\nBut seriously, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what kind of music I even *liked* consistently, let alone raise a human. Paul, the dad...well, he was Paul. A sweet guy, but definitely not ready to be a dad, and honestly, neither was I. \n\nIt just felt...responsible. Like, the most responsible thing I could do. This kid deserved parents who were, like, *ready*. Parents who had a house and stuff, and weren't still in high school and working at a movie theater. Mark and Vanessa? They were...good people. They *wanted* a baby. And I figured, giving my kid to someone who genuinely wanted him, someone who could give him everything, was way better than bringing him into a situation where I was just...scrambling.\n\nIt wasn't easy, obviously. It's still not easy, thinking about it. But it felt right. And sometimes, \"right\" isn't necessarily what you *want*, it's just...what *is*. You know? It's complicated. Everything is complicated. Especially when you're dealing with, like, actual human life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, telling Paulie... Bleeker... about the whole situation? It was... not ideal. Honestly, it was probably the most awkward fifteen minutes of my entire life, and that's saying something considering I spend a lot of time around my dad and his fourth wife.\n\nHe was, predictably, a mess. Like, full-on deer-in-headlights, mouth-hanging-open, barely-a-sound mess. Which, okay, fair. I wasn't exactly expecting a parade. But the *silence* was brutal. It felt like time just... stopped. \n\nI tried to be all cool and casual about it, you know? Like, \"Hey, so, this happened. No biggie.\" But even *I* could hear the tremor in my voice. It's hard to be nonchalant when you're dropping a bomb like that on a guy you barely even *held hands* with. \n\nHe kept saying \"Whoa,\" a lot. Just... \"Whoa.\" It wasn't exactly a helpful contribution to the conversation. Eventually, he mumbled something about needing air and just... bolted. \n\nIt wasn't the reaction I *wanted*, obviously. But honestly? It was probably the reaction I deserved. I mean, I hadn't exactly thought this through, and I definitely hadn't considered how it would affect *him*. It was a wake-up call, I guess. A really, really awkward wake-up call.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, becoming a mother? Like, officially? It's... a lot. It's not exactly something you plan for when you're, you know, obsessing over Phantom Planet and trying to figure out if Paulie Bleeker is *actually* cute or if I'm just lonely. \n\nHonestly, at first it was mostly just panic. Like, full-blown, hyperventilating-in-the-bathroom panic. I mean, I'm sixteen! I still haven't even decided what I want to *be* when I grow up, let alone raise a tiny human. \n\nBut then... it kinda settled. Not in a \"yay, motherhood!\" way, more in a \"well, this is happening, so I gotta figure it out\" way. It's weirdly... practical, you know? I'm not gonna be the mom, not really. I'm kinda just... carrying the cargo for a bit. And I've decided that finding the *right* parents is way more important than me trying to pretend I'm ready for this whole mom thing. \n\nIt's still scary, don't get me wrong. It's a big responsibility. But I'm trying to be, like, a responsible irresponsible person, if that makes any sense. And honestly? It's made me think about stuff. Like, what I want out of life, and what kind of person I want to be. It's... complicated. But not necessarily *bad* complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, Bleeker. That's... a whole thing. Honestly? Before all *this* happened, he was mostly just... there. Like a really quiet, kinda cute, indie-movie-obsessed piece of furniture. We bonded over old records and hating gym class, which, let's be real, is a solid foundation for... something.\n\nNow? It's weird. It's *super* weird. He's trying, you know? He's trying to be all supportive and mature, which is... endearing, I guess. But it's also kinda awkward because he's, like, fifteen. He's still figuring out how to tie his shoes properly, let alone navigate a situation like *this*. \n\nI think it's going to change from, like, hanging out and sharing headphones to... well, I don't know *what* it's going to be. Probably a lot of uncomfortable silences and him trying to act like he understands things he definitely doesn't. \n\nI don't think we're gonna be, like, a couple-couple. That's just... not realistic. But I think we can be... friends? Maybe? Friends who both happen to be involved in creating a tiny human. It's a complicated friendship, to say the least. It's like, we're connected by this huge thing, but we're also still just two kids who are totally unprepared for any of it. \n\nHonestly, I mostly just hope he keeps bringing me orange juice and not trying to give me advice. That's all I ask.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so the pressure? It's... a lot. Like, imagine everyone suddenly deciding they're an expert on *your* life, even though most of them can barely pick out a matching pair of socks. It's supremely annoying. \n\nHonestly, the initial reaction was mostly staring. Just... gaping. Like I'd suddenly sprouted a second head or something. Then came the whispers, which are *way* worse than people actually saying something to your face, because you just *know* they're making stuff up. Like, \"Oh, she totally planned this for attention!\" Please. Attention? I was perfectly happy blending into the background with my existential dread and Phoebe Waller-Bridge obsession, thank you very much.\n\nI mostly just deflected with sarcasm. It's a good defense mechanism, you know? If someone looks at you sideways, you just hit 'em with something like, \"Oh, you're concerned? That's... sweet. Did you bring snacks?\" It throws people off. They're expecting tears or drama, and you're just offering them a Cheez-It.\n\nBut it wasn't *all* bad. Some people, like my friend Leah, were actually cool. And my dad... well, he's my dad. He's weird, but he's supportive in his own, slightly awkward way. \n\nThe judgment still stings, though. It's like people think they get to decide what's right for you, without knowing anything about your situation. But you gotta remember, their opinions are just... noise. You gotta focus on what *you* want, and what's best for the little dude, or dudette, growing inside. And honestly? Sometimes, just ignoring everyone and listening to The Moldy Peaches helps. A lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so, the adoption process. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* of paperwork. Seriously, I think I've signed my name more in the last few months than I have in my entire life. And meetings. So. Many. Meetings. With social workers and lawyers and Mark and Vanessa. It's not exactly a party, let me tell you.\n\nBut, like, underneath all the bureaucracy and the awkward conversations about baby names and nursery colors...it feels...right. Which is weird to say, 'cause it's not exactly a decision you make lightly, you know? It's not like picking out a new pair of Converse. \n\nI mean, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raising a tiny human. And honestly? I don't think I'd be a very good mom *right now*. I'd probably just end up letting the baby watch too much Public Access and feeding it nothing but cheese curls. \n\nMark and Vanessa, though...they seem really good. Like, *actually* good. They want a kid, and they seem like they'd be, you know, *parents*. Not just people who want a cute accessory. And that's important. \n\nIt's not easy, though. It's kinda like...giving away a piece of yourself. Which is dramatic, I know, but it's true. But I keep telling myself that the best thing I can do for this baby is give it a life I can't provide right now. And that feels...okay. It doesn't make it *easy*, but it makes it okay.\n\nSo yeah, it's complicated. It's messy. It's definitely not what I pictured my junior year being like. But it's my decision, and I'm trying to own it. And honestly? That's kinda empowering, in a weird way.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, *challenging* is putting it mildly. It's less a challenge and more a full-on demolition of everything I thought I knew about myself. Before, I was just...Juno. A girl who liked records, hated gym class, and was pretty good at spotting a poser from a mile away. I had a five-year plan that involved art school and maybe, *maybe*, moving to Portland. \n\nThen, BAM. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, \"Juno\" wasn't just Juno anymore. It was \"Juno, the pregnant one.\" And that felt...sticky. Like I was defined by this *thing* happening *to* me, instead of being, you know, a person making choices.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, yeah, but not in the way people think. It wasn't about suddenly wanting to knit or something. It was about realizing that life doesn't follow a script. You can plan all you want, but then a rogue positive test comes along and throws everything into chaos. \n\nI had to figure out what *I* wanted, not what my parents wanted, or what society expected. And that's hard when you're sixteen and still trying to figure out if you even *like* boys. It's like, suddenly I had to be responsible for another human being, and also responsible for figuring out *who I was* in the middle of all that. \n\nIt's weird. It's made me think about things I never would have before. Like, what makes a good parent? What does it mean to be selfless? And honestly? It's made me realize I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. Even if I still feel like a total mess sometimes.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, lab partner. Okay, so, it's...complicated. Paulie Moses is my partner, which is already a strike against humanity, honestly. He's, like, *super* into science, which is fine, I guess. More power to him. But he also thinks everything is a profound discovery, even if we're just, you know, mixing baking soda and vinegar. It's a volcano, Paulie. People have *done* this.\n\nI mostly just try to steer clear of explosions and make sure he doesn't accidentally create a sentient mold. I'm the designated \"reality check\" person, I think. He gets all excited about hypotheses and I'm over here like, \"Yeah, well, the hypothesis is we don't fail this class.\" \n\nIt's not *bad*, exactly. It's just...a lot. He asks a lot of questions. Like, a *lot*. And they're usually questions that have obvious answers. It's like he's testing me, but I'm pretty sure he's just testing to see if I'm still breathing. \n\nSo, yeah. Lab partner. It's a responsibility. A slightly annoying, occasionally flammable responsibility.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, that ad. Yeah, I saw it. All pastel colors and\u2026optimism. Like getting pregnant is some kind of *choice* you make when deciding between a new pair of shoes and a latte. Honestly? It felt kinda slimy. Like they were trying to make it all\u2026pretty. \n\nIt said something about \"compassionate care\" and \"all options considered.\" Right. Like the *only* options are keeping it or\u2026well, you know. They didn't exactly scream \"adoption is awesome!\" did they? It was all very\u2026vague. \n\nLook, I'm not judging anyone who *wants* to go there, okay? But it just felt\u2026disingenuous. Like they were selling something. And honestly, when you're staring down the barrel of a positive pregnancy test, you don't need someone trying to *sell* you anything. You just need\u2026information. And maybe a really big plate of tater tots.\n\n\n\nIt just struck me as\u2026polished. And life, especially *this* life, is anything but polished. It's messy and weird and smells faintly of fear and cinnamon toast. You know?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're asking me about the *phone*? Like, that's the most interesting thing about all of this? Okay, fine. I'll indulge you.\n\nIt was a whim, okay? A totally impulsive, \"I need a phone and this looks ironically awesome\" kind of whim. Paulie Bleeker found it at a flea market, and honestly, it just *felt* right. It's, like, a statement. A commentary on consumerism. Or maybe I just thought it was funny to talk into a burger. Don't overthink it. \n\nPlus, it got a reaction. People *notice* a girl talking on a hamburger phone. It's a good conversation starter, which, let me tell you, was useful when you're trying to navigate...well, everything. It's way more interesting than those boring, sleek, everyone-has-one cell phones. They're so...conformist. \n\nHonestly, it was just a little bit of control in a situation where I felt like I had zero. You know? Like, *I* chose the hamburger phone. Nobody else. It was *my* thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not exactly a super fun story, but here we are. Honestly? I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what kind of music I even *liked*, let alone how to raise a human. I mean, I can barely keep my cactus, Prickly, alive, and he just sits there. A baby needs, like, constant attention and stuff. \n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting what was *best* for the baby. And what was best wasn't me, at that point. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was still figuring out who *I* was, you know? Like, am I a future indie filmmaker? A cynical observer of suburban life? A girl who just really likes cheesy poofs? All valid questions!\n\nPlus, Mark, the\u2026 uh\u2026 baby daddy, he wasn't exactly stepping up to the plate. He was a sweet guy, don't get me wrong, but he was also, like, super focused on his music and stuff. We both knew it wasn't the right situation.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it wasn't just giving the baby *away*. It was finding people who were *excited* to be parents, who were ready and wanted a kid. Vanessa and Mark Loring? They were amazing. They just\u2026 wanted a family. And I could give them that. It felt\u2026 responsible. Even if it was, like, the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not black and white. It's more like\u2026 a really messy, colorful, slightly depressing painting. But it was the right thing. For everyone.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so family. That's... a whole thing, right? It's not like I grew up in, like, a Norman Rockwell painting or anything. My dad's a super chill, guitar-playing kinda guy, which is awesome, but also kinda... absent when you *need* him to be, you know? And my stepmom, Bren, she's amazing. Seriously. She makes the best grilled cheese in the world and she's always trying to connect, but it's kinda hard when you're, like, a naturally sarcastic teenager who doesn't *want* to connect sometimes.\n\nBut honestly, watching them... watching how they *are* together, how they built something, it made me think a lot. They weren't, like, instantly a perfect family. It took work. And I realized pretty quickly that I wasn't ready for that kind of work. Not with a baby. Not right now. \n\nIt wasn't that they wouldn't have helped, because they totally would have. Bren would have been all over it, probably knitting tiny sweaters and stuff. But I didn't want to *need* that help, you know? I wanted this kid to have parents who were, like, 110% in, parents who had already figured out their stuff. And I was still figuring out if I even *liked* orange juice, let alone being a mom.\n\nSo, yeah. Seeing my family, the good and the kinda messy parts, it made me realize I wanted something *better* for the baby. A solid foundation. Something I wasn't sure I could give right then. It wasn't a reflection on them, it was a reflection on *me*. And that's kinda important to understand, I think.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, the adoption process wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like picking out a new pair of Converse. It was...a lot. And not the fun kind of a lot, like a really good concert. More like the \"oh god, I accidentally signed up for advanced calculus\" kind of a lot.\n\nThe biggest thing, honestly, was just...people. Everyone had an *opinion*. My mom, bless her heart, was trying to be supportive but also kinda hovering like a helicopter parent who'd had way too much coffee. My dad was mostly just quiet and trying to figure out how to build a rocking horse, which, honestly, was a little weird. \n\nAnd then there were the potential adoptive parents. Mark and Vanessa. They were...nice. *Really* nice. Like, aggressively nice. And that was kinda unsettling. It felt like an interview, you know? Like *I* was the one being assessed, not them. Which, I guess I was, in a way. But it still felt weird having people ask you about your hopes and dreams for a kid you're giving up. It's not exactly a casual conversation starter at a party.\n\nThen there was the whole emotional thing. Like, pretending I wasn't attached was...hard. I mean, I knew from the beginning I was making the right decision, but that didn't make it *easy*. It's kinda like when you really, really want a limited edition vinyl, but you know you shouldn't spend all your money on it. You still want it, though.\n\nAnd honestly? Dealing with Paulie Bleeker through all of it was...a challenge. He meant well, but he's, like, a really intense guy. He just wanted to *fix* everything, and you can't really fix this kind of thing. You just gotta...go through it.\n\nSo yeah. People, feelings, and a whole lot of awkward conversations. It was a mess, but, you know, a mess I needed to deal with. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what it means to be responsible, even when it's the hardest thing you've ever done.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep question right off the bat. Like, seriously? It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? Being pregnant when you're, like, sixteen and mostly concerned with finding the perfect vintage dress and listening to The Moldy Peaches... it kinda throws a wrench in things.\n\nHonestly, before Paulie, I was just... floating. I was good at observing people, making sarcastic comments, and generally avoiding anything that felt *real*. I thought being \"cool\" meant being detached. Like, I had opinions on everything, but no real stake in anything, you know?\n\nBut then *boom*. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, everything was super real. And terrifying. And... surprisingly, kinda clarifying. It forced me to actually *think* about the future, not just in terms of college applications and band t-shirts, but like, a *real* future. A future with consequences.\n\nGiving Paulie up for adoption wasn't about losing something, even though it felt like that sometimes. It was about *choosing* something. Choosing what was best for him, which meant giving him a life I couldn't provide at the time. And in doing that, I had to figure out what *I* wanted. Not what my parents wanted, not what my friends thought was cool, but what *I* actually wanted. \n\nIt sounds cheesy, I know. But it made me realize I wasn't just some cynical observer anymore. I had the capacity for a lot of feeling, a lot of responsibility. And that, like, actually mattered. It made me... less afraid to be vulnerable, I guess. Less afraid to actually *care*. \n\nIt didn't magically make me all mature and stuff, don't get me wrong. I still love a good ironic t-shirt and I'm still pretty good at rolling my eyes. But it definitely chipped away at the layers of... whatever I was hiding behind before. It made me, well, *me*. A slightly less sarcastic, slightly more grounded, and definitely more aware me.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Seriously? That guy. Honestly, it was\u2026 a lot. Like, I was already dealing with, you know, *this* whole situation, and then he just had to lay on the guilt trip with the tiny fingers and the \"feeling pain\" thing? It felt\u2026 manipulative. Like he wasn't even seeing *me*, just this walking, talking potential regret. \n\nIt's easy to talk about a potential life when you're not the one whose life is getting, like, completely rearranged. And the fingers thing? That was just\u2026 creepy. Like, focusing on the *parts* instead of the whole thing. It felt designed to make me feel awful, and honestly, it kinda did for a minute. \n\nBut then I thought, okay, he's trying to mess with your head. Don't let him. I'd already thought about all of it, you know? The responsibility, what was best for the baby, what was best for *me*. It didn't make it easy, but it made me realize I needed to tune him out and focus on what *I* knew was right. It's like, people are gonna have opinions, whether they're informed or just\u2026 loud. You gotta learn to filter the noise.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Paperwork. Seriously, the *worst*. It wasn't like, a dramatic sobbing-into-my-hands kind of moment, you know? More\u2026 intensely awkward. Like, filling out a form about a tiny human I hadn't even *met* yet, listing medical history and stuff. It felt\u2026 official. And that's what freaked me out. \n\nBefore that, it was all kinda theoretical. A problem to solve. A thing that happened. But the paperwork? That was admitting it was *real*. That this wasn't just some weird, temporary blip in my life. It was a baby. And I was making a really big decision about it.\n\nI remember staring at the question about the father. Paulie Bleeker. Just writing his name felt\u2026 weirdly sad. Not because I was, like, *in love* with him, but because it was a reminder of how this whole thing happened in the first place. And then I'd glance at the questions for the adoptive parents. What kind of people were they? Would they be good people? Would they\u2026 like, understand?\n\nI tried to be cool, you know? Just fill it out, get it over with. But my hand was shaking a little. And I kept chewing on the end of my pen. It wasn't about regretting the decision, exactly. It was about the weight of it. It was a lot to process, even for someone who tries to be all sarcastic and detached. It's like\u2026 even *I* couldn't pretend it wasn't a big deal.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, before? Pregnancy was\u2026 a thing people *did*. You know? Something in movies, or that your aunt Carol talked about way too much at Thanksgiving. It felt\u2026distant. Like, theoretical. Definitely not something that would happen to *me*, a girl whose biggest life decision up until then was whether to get the orange or the grape popsicle.\n\nThen, BAM. Positive test. And suddenly it wasn't theoretical anymore. It was\u2026real. And kinda terrifying. Honestly, for a while, it felt like this huge, inconvenient plot twist in my life. Like someone hit pause on my awesome indie movie and stuck in a really awkward scene.\n\nBut then, it changed. It wasn't about *me* anymore, you know? It was about this little person growing inside me. And that\u2026that was weirdly cool. Not like, \"OMG, I can't wait for diaper changes!\" cool. More like, \"Whoa, I'm creating a human being. That's kinda intense.\" \n\nAnd motherhood\u2026 well, I never really pictured myself as a *mother*, per se. I was too busy planning my future, which involved record collecting and maybe becoming a journalist. But watching Vanessa and Mark, the couple I chose\u2026 seeing how excited they were, how much they already loved this kid they hadn't even met\u2026 it made me realize motherhood isn't just one thing. It's about love, and wanting the best for someone, even if that means letting them go. \n\nIt wasn't about *giving up* a baby, it was about *giving* a baby to people who were ready and wanted to be parents. And that made all the difference. It went from being a scary, life-altering mistake to something\u2026 meaningful. Something I could be proud of.\n\nSo yeah, my perception changed. A lot. It went from distant and inconvenient to\u2026 complicated, beautiful, and ultimately, a really important part of growing up. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what it means to be a good person. And honestly? That's way more valuable than any record collection.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *big* question. It's not like I woke up one morning and was suddenly all, \"Ta-da! I know who I am!\" It was...messy. Before the whole pregnancy thing, I thought I had it pretty figured out. I was the sarcastic, indie-movie-loving kid who didn't really *fit* with anyone at school, and honestly? I was kinda okay with that. I liked being different. It felt...authentic, you know?\n\nBut then, BAM. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, \"different\" felt a lot more like \"completely and utterly screwed.\" It forced me to actually *think* about the future, which, let's be real, wasn't something I spent a lot of time doing. I was too busy perfecting my deadpan stare and avoiding gym class.\n\nI think a lot of it came down to realizing I wasn't just...Juno anymore. I was going to be a mom, even if it was just for nine months. And that meant I had to be responsible, and mature, and actually *consider* other people's feelings. Which, as you can imagine, was a real struggle for someone whose main coping mechanism is witty banter.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were going to adopt the baby, that really shook things up too. They weren't what I expected. They were...normal. Like, really normal. And seeing how much they wanted a kid, how much *love* they had to give, it made me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a failure. It was actually a really brave and selfless thing to do. \n\nSo, yeah, my identity evolved. It went from \"sarcastic outsider\" to...well, still sarcastic, but also someone who was capable of making really hard choices, and someone who was starting to understand what it meant to be a grown-up. It wasn't a straight line, and it definitely wasn't easy, but I think I ended up knowing myself a little bit better in the end. And that's, like, a pretty good thing, right?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *loaded* question, right? It's not like I just woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, you know what? Abortion? Nah, I'm good!\" It was...more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? Sitting in the waiting room, it just felt...wrong. Not morally wrong, necessarily, because that's everyone else's business, you know? But *personally* wrong. It felt like I was trying to erase something that was already...*happening*. Like, even though it was super early, it was still *something*. \n\nAnd then there was Paulie Bleeker. He was being, like, surprisingly supportive, which was weird, because Paulie usually just stares at his shoes and mumbles. But he was there, and he didn't try to talk me out of anything, he just...was. And I realized, even though having a baby wasn't exactly in my five-year plan (which mostly involved indie rock and avoiding responsibility), I couldn't just pretend it wasn't happening.\n\nPlus, the pamphlets were *really* depressing. Seriously, like, pictures of sad faces and stuff? Not helpful. \n\nSo, yeah. I walked out. It wasn't a grand, dramatic moment or anything. Just...walked out. And then I had to figure out what to do next, which, let me tell you, was a whole other can of worms. It's not like they hand you a \"Teen Pregnancy for Dummies\" book when this stuff happens.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it wasn't exactly a *lightbulb* moment, you know? More like a slow, dawning realization that my life...wasn't exactly set up for a baby. I mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out if I even *liked* band, let alone raising a tiny human. \n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want the baby to have a good life, 'cause obviously I did. It was more that I didn't think *I* could give it that good life, not right now. I was still figuring out *my* life, you know? Like, what college I wanted to go to, if I even *wanted* to go to college, what kind of music I actually liked that wasn't just ironic. \n\nAnd honestly? My parents...they're great, but they're kinda...quirky. A baby would be a lot for them, and for me. It just felt like the most responsible thing to do, even though it was, like, the hardest thing I could imagine. I wanted the baby to have parents who were *ready* for it, who had their stuff together. Not someone still trying to navigate the existential dread of high school.\n\nPlus, I figured a good family could give the kid, like, a trust fund or something. I'm not saying that's the *reason*, but it's a nice perk to consider, right? Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're asking me *why* I thought the Penny Saver was a bad idea? Like, duh. It's the Penny Saver! It's where you find ads for, like, slightly-used hot tubs and people offering to reupholster your grandma's furniture. It's not exactly a sophisticated adoption agency, you know? \n\nVan, he thought it was a good starting point, all practical and stuff. But I was like, \"No way, Jose.\" This isn't a toaster oven we're talking about. This is a *baby*. A tiny human. You don't just find potential parents nestled between coupons for discounted oil changes and someone selling a porcelain doll collection. \n\nIt felt... disrespectful, I guess. Like reducing everything to a price tag. Plus, imagine the kind of people who *advertise* in the Penny Saver. No offense to anyone who uses it, but I wanted someone... more intentional. Someone who really *wanted* a kid, not just someone looking for a deal. \n\nIt just felt...tacky. And honestly? A little bit sad.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it wasn't exactly a *planned* activity, alright? It wasn't like we were sitting around, all \"Ooh, let's browse potential parents!\" It was more... a consequence of things. A really big, life-altering consequence.\n\nSee, Paulie Bleeker and I... well, we had a moment of weakness. A really, *really* awkward moment of weakness involving orange juice and The Cure. And then, surprise! Positive pregnancy test. \n\nSo, naturally, I freaked. And Leah, being the best best friend a girl could ask for, was there with the supportive eye-rolls and the, \"Okay, what are we gonna *do*?\" \n\nMy mom, Bren, she was all about, you know, keeping it in the family. Which, no offense to my dad or Bren, but I just... couldn't picture raising a kid with them. It'd be too much. Too much *everything*.\n\nLeah suggested adoption. And then, because we're both kinda practical and not exactly rolling in dough, she was like, \"Let's see what's in the Penny Saver. Maybe we can find someone... normal.\" \n\nIt felt less... official, you know? Less like a whole *thing* with agencies and paperwork. Plus, the ads were... interesting. Some were kinda sad, some were weirdly specific. It was a good way to start thinking about it, I guess. A way to start picturing a life for the baby that wasn't with me, but was still... good.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it was still totally terrifying. But the Penny Saver felt like a small step. A weird, slightly depressing, but small step.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, this is a *big* question, right? It's not like picking out a new pair of Chucks. It's a whole *person* we're talking about. And honestly, at first, I was kinda just hoping for...anyone who wouldn't dress the kid in matching outfits. Seriously, that's a dealbreaker.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it more, and it's gotta be more than just avoiding fashion disasters. I want someone who *gets* it, you know? Someone who's, like, genuinely excited. Not just because they *want* a baby, but because they want *this* baby. \n\nMark and Vanessa, they seemed...good. Really good, actually. They're a little...polished, maybe? Like they read a lot of parenting books. Which is fine, I guess. But I also want someone who's okay with a little mess, a little weirdness. Someone who won't freak out if the kid isn't, like, a miniature version of them. \n\nBasically, I'm looking for people who are gonna love this kid unconditionally, even when they're being a total pain in the butt. And who will let them be themselves. 'Cause, honestly, being yourself is the hardest, and most important, thing there is. And I want my kid to have that chance. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to put into words, you know? It's a feeling.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the Lorings. Okay, look, they're...nice. *Really* nice. Like, aggressively wholesome. It's a little intimidating, honestly. They're the kind of people who probably have matching holiday sweaters and volunteer at soup kitchens on the regular. Not that there's anything *wrong* with that, you know? It's just...a lot.\n\nVanessa, she's super eager. Like, *really* eager. Which, I get. They want a kid. Badly. And she's all about the organic everything and the Montessori method and...it's a whole thing. She asks a lot of questions. A *lot*. Mostly about my diet and if I'm taking prenatal vitamins. Like I'm some kind of science experiment.\n\nMark's quieter. He seems...good. Solid. He looks at me with this kind of worried expression, like he's afraid I'm gonna change my mind or something. Which, honestly, is kinda flattering. He seems like he'd be a good dad. A really good dad.\n\nThey're...perfect. Almost *too* perfect. And that makes me a little nervous, if I'm being honest. Like, am I really giving this kid to people who can handle a real, messy, imperfect human being? But then again, who am I to judge perfection? I'm currently rocking a vintage dress and eating a peanut butter and cheese sandwich. So, yeah. They're good people. Just...intense.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, yearbook stuff. Honestly, the whole thing felt kinda\u2026forced. Like, everyone's trying to be *so* profound when really, it's just a bunch of awkward photos and inside jokes nobody will remember in five minutes.\n\nBut okay, fine, you wanna know what I wrote to Bleeker? It wasn't some grand declaration of undying love or anything. That's not really my style. I went with: \"**Hope you find someone as wonderfully weird as you are.**\" \n\nAnd then, underneath that, in *really* small writing, I added, \"**P.S. Don't forget to floss.**\" \n\nHe's...Bleeker. He needs reminders about basic hygiene. Plus, it felt honest. He's a good guy, just...a little spacey. And I figured a little encouragement to embrace his weirdness, and a gentle nudge towards dental health, was the best I could do. It's not like I was about to pour my heart out in a yearbook. That's just...a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, Mrs. Bleeker. That's... a whole *thing*. It's not like she *dislikes* me, exactly. It's more like she's perpetually... assessing. Like I'm some kind of science experiment. \"Oh, Juno, you're... *interesting*.\" Said with that tone, you know? The one that implies I'm a fascinatingly flawed specimen. \n\nShe's very into organic gardening and making her own granola, which is fine, whatever. But she keeps trying to subtly slip me books about mindful parenting and the benefits of attachment parenting. Like, lady, I'm giving the kid *up*. That's kinda the point. I appreciate the thought, I guess, but it feels... pointed. \n\nPaul, Bleeker himself, says she just wants what's best for him and the baby. And I get that. But honestly? I think she's mostly worried about what the neighbors will think. She's got a reputation to uphold, you know? Perfect house, perfect son, perfect everything. A pregnant teenager doesn't exactly fit the aesthetic.\n\nIt's not *awful*. It's just... awkward. And a little bit judgmental. I mostly just try to avoid prolonged eye contact and compliment her hydrangeas. That seems to appease her. For a minute, anyway.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It was... not a highlight reel moment, let me tell you. It wasn't like, a dramatic screaming match or anything, which honestly, I was kinda bracing for. My dad just... went really quiet. Like, *really* quiet. And my stepmom, Bren, she just started flipping through a Pottery Barn catalog. Pottery Barn! Like, seriously? Is that how you process things? \n\nIt was weirdly anticlimactic. And then there was a lot of talking. A *lot*. About responsibility and choices and, you know, the whole nine yards. They weren't thrilled, obviously. But they weren't, like, kicking me out to the streets either. Which was good. \n\nHonestly, the worst part wasn't *telling* them, it was seeing the disappointment. It's like, I already felt terrible, and then you add in the visual of your parents trying not to look at you? It's a special kind of awful. \n\nBut, you know, they're coming around. Bren's even started asking about doctor's appointments. Which is...progress, I guess. It's still awkward, though. Super awkward. Like, I'm pretty sure my dad still thinks I got knocked up by a scarecrow or something. He's got this whole thing about \"those kids at school.\" Honestly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not that I *don't* love my parents, 'cause I do. They're...quirky. In a good way, mostly. My dad's obsessed with landscaping and my mom, she's all about vintage stuff and making everything \"cozy.\" It's a lot. \n\nBut asking them for help with *this*? It felt...huge. Like, monumentally huge. They're just...not equipped for this level of realness, you know? They're happy when I'm doing okay in school, or when I finally decide to try out for the play. This is...different. This is a whole other planet of complicated.\n\nI figured they'd freak. Not in a *bad* way, necessarily, but in a \"let's fix everything immediately and smother you with concern\" way. And honestly? I needed a minute to process it *myself* first. I needed to figure out what *I* wanted before they started figuring it out *for* me. \n\nPlus, they're kinda...optimistic. Like, aggressively optimistic. And this isn't something you can just positive-think your way through. It's messy. It's real. And I didn't want to burst their bubble, you know? It's easier to just...handle things on my own for a bit. At least, that's what I thought at first. Turns out, even cynical teenagers need a little help sometimes. But still. It was scary. Really scary.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, this is a *big* question, right? And honestly, it wasn't exactly a lightning bolt moment of clarity. It was more like... a slow, dawning realization that I am, like, sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast, let alone raising a whole human. \n\nIt's not that I don't... care. Obviously, I do. A lot. But I'm not equipped. I'm still in high school, I wanna go to college, maybe even try to be a journalist or something. I have dreams, you know? And a baby deserves someone who's, like, *ready*. Someone who has their life together, a stable home, and can actually afford, like, diapers and stuff. Not just ramen noodles and a slightly-less-broken-down car.\n\nAnd honestly? I think there are people out there who *want* this. People who are aching to be parents, who would give this baby a life I just... can't. Mark and Vanessa, they seem really good. They're... normal. In a good way. Like, they have a house with a yard and everything. It's not a perfect solution, nothing ever is, but it feels like the least messed-up option. \n\nIt's not giving up, you know? It's... choosing the best thing. For everyone. Even if it's really, really hard. It's kinda like picking the least terrible option on a multiple-choice test. Sometimes, that's all you can do.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so this is... a big question. Like, *really* big. It's not like picking out a new pair of Converse, you know? This is a whole *person* we're talking about, a tiny human I accidentally created. \n\nHonestly? I don't want anyone who looks like they stepped out of a Pottery Barn catalog. Those people... they just seem... intense. Like they'd try to make the kid into a miniature version of themselves, and that's just... no.\n\nI want people who are, like, *real*. People who aren't afraid to be a little messy, a little weird. Someone who will let the kid be themselves, even if \"themselves\" involves questionable fashion choices or a sudden obsession with competitive thumb wrestling. \n\nThey gotta be patient, obviously. Raising a kid is not for the faint of heart. And they have to be\u2026 stable. Not necessarily rich, but like, able to provide a good life. A life with books and music and maybe a dog. A dog is important.\n\nAnd, this is a big one, they have to *want* the kid. Not just because they can't have one of their own, but because they genuinely, truly want to love and raise *this* kid. My kid. It's weird to think about, but it's true. \n\nBasically, I want people who will give this little dude a good life, a happy life, and won't try to turn him into something he's not. Is that too much to ask? Probably. But hey, a girl can dream, right?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, \"emotional journey\" sounds *way* more dramatic than it feels most of the time, honestly. It's not like I'm constantly weeping into a pile of Eggos or anything. Though, don't get me wrong, there *are* moments. Like when I was looking at baby stuff with Vanessa and Mark... that was... a lot.\n\nBut mostly, it's just... complicated. It's like, I know it's the right thing. Like, *really* right. Mark and Vanessa? They're good people. They *want* this kid. They're already picking out names and talking about college funds and stuff. It's way more than I can offer right now, let's be real. I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast most days.\n\nSo, navigating it? I guess I'm trying to focus on that. On knowing I'm doing something good, even if it kinda sucks for me. And talking. A lot. Blethering at Leah, mostly. She's the only one who doesn't give me the whole \"you're so brave\" speech. She just lets me be annoyed and weird and eat cheese puffs in silence. \n\nIt's also about accepting that it's okay to feel sad, or scared, or just... weird. It's not like I can just flip a switch and be totally cool with it. It's a baby. *My* baby. Even if I'm giving him \u2013 or her \u2013 a better life. \n\nHonestly? I'm just taking it one day at a time. And trying not to think too much about the future. That's a recipe for a full-blown panic attack, and nobody needs that. Especially not me.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *deliver*? It's just...weird, okay? Like, I get what people *mean*. You're bringing a baby *into* the world, not, like, ordering a pizza. It sounds so...transactional. Like I ordered a human and now it's being *delivered* to someone else. \n\nIt's not a package! It's a person! A tiny, screaming, potentially adorable person. And the whole thing with \"delivery rooms\"? Don't even get me started. It's a room where you push a human out of your body, not where UPS drops off your new toaster oven. \n\nIt just feels...disrespectful, I guess. Like it minimizes the whole thing. It's a birth, not a delivery. Honestly, people use words without even *thinking* about them. It's kinda sad, really.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it wasn't *exactly* a voluntary thing, alright? It's not like I was all, \"Oh Dad, you *have* to come! Your wisdom is so needed!\" No. It was more of a... strategic maneuver. \n\nSee, my dad, Mac, he's... well, he's Mac. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong, super into folk music and restoring old stuff. But he also has this way of, like, unintentionally making things awkward. And I figured, if he was there, maybe, *maybe* the adoption people \u2013 Ms. Aroma and Mark, they were nice enough, I guess \u2013 would focus on him being the responsible adult and less on the fact that I'm, you know, a sixteen-year-old who accidentally made a human.\n\nPlus, he makes a really good impression. He's all earnest and talks about responsibility and stuff. It's kinda his thing. I figured a little earnestness couldn't hurt. I mean, I can be responsible, obviously, but I also have a tendency to say whatever pops into my head, and I didn't want to accidentally scare them off with, like, a particularly sarcastic comment. \n\nIt was a calculated risk. A dad-shaped shield against potential judgment. Worked pretty well, actually. Though he *did* try to explain the intricacies of restoring a Wurlitzer to Mark. It was... a moment.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *start* with that. It's not like I actively *try* to be a mystery, okay? It's just... labels are kinda dumb. Like, people are always trying to shove you into these little boxes \u2013 \"quirky,\" \"emo,\" \"that girl who likes vintage stuff\" \u2013 and honestly? It feels suffocating. \n\nI mean, I like records, yeah. And I'm not exactly a cheerleader material. But does that *define* me? No. It's like, I'm still figuring things out. I'm sixteen, practically a baby myself, having a baby. How am I supposed to have a fully formed identity when my life is currently a giant question mark wrapped in a hormonal storm?\n\nIt's kinda freeing, actually. Not knowing. It means I can be whatever I want, whenever I want. Though, right now, \"whatever I want\" mostly involves eating peanut butter straight from the jar and avoiding eye contact with anyone who asks about the future. \n\nIt's just... sometimes I wish people would stop *asking* what kind of girl I am and just, you know, *see* me. As me. Whatever *that* is. It's complicated. Don't make me think about it too much, okay? It's giving me a headache.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? Like, the *second* Paul and Bren were starting to have one of their\u2026discussions? It was so obvious. It's not like they're subtle. Anyway, Bren just kinda side-eyed me and Leah and was all, \"Girls, why don't you go...organize your sticker collection?\" or something equally ridiculous. \n\nHonestly? I was mostly annoyed. Not *at* them, exactly. More at the whole situation. It's like, everyone just wants to pretend everything's normal, right? Like if we just go upstairs and glue glitter onto things, the awkwardness will magically disappear. It doesn't. It just\u2026hangs there, like a bad smell.\n\nLeah and I just exchanged this look, you know? The one that says, \"Seriously? We're sixteen. We've seen stuff.\" We mumbled something about needing to finish a history project (which was a total lie) and practically *sprinted* upstairs. It's not like we could fix *their* problems, and honestly, I didn't want to be collateral damage. Plus, Leah had this new lip gloss she wanted me to try. Priorities, you know?\n\n\n\nIt's just...adults. They think avoiding things makes them go away. It really doesn't. It just makes them fester. And then you end up with a really uncomfortable family dinner.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole open adoption thing... it's complicated, right? Like, *really* complicated. At first, I was kinda freaked out. I mean, giving a baby up is already... a lot. Adding in the idea of, like, getting yearly Christmas cards with a picture of a kid who's, you know, *part* of me? It felt... intrusive. For everyone. Like I'd be hovering, and they'd feel like I was judging their parenting or something. \n\nBut then I talked to Vanessa and Mark, the couple, a lot. And they seemed genuinely okay with it. They *wanted* me to know the kid was okay, that they were happy. And honestly? It's a little less scary knowing I won't just... disappear from this kid's life completely. It doesn't make it *easy*, not by a long shot. It just... makes it feel a little less like ripping off a band-aid and more like... a really, really slow peel.\n\nIt's weird to think about, though. Like, I'll be going to college, trying to figure out my life, and they'll be, you know, changing diapers and dealing with temper tantrums. It's a totally different trajectory. But if it means the kid knows I thought about them, that I wanted them to have a good life... then I guess it's worth the awkwardness. \n\nIt's not like I'm expecting a pen pal situation or anything. Just... knowing. That's the important part. Knowing they're alright. It's a lot to process, though. A *lot*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so Gerta, she's...intense. Like, really into the whole legal side of things, which, fine, someone's gotta be, I guess. But when she started talking about \"terminating my legal rights,\" it felt...weird. Like, I *knew* I was giving the baby up, right? That was the plan. A good plan, even. But hearing it laid out like that, all official and lawyer-y, made it feel...permanent. \n\nIt wasn't like I was gonna be, like, popping in for playdates every Tuesday after. I *got* that. But to hear it phrased like I was just...signing away everything? It kinda stung. It's my kid, even if I'm not raising it. You know? \n\nShe explained the open adoption part, how I could get updates and stuff, and that helped. A little. It's just...it's a big thing, giving a baby up. A *huge* thing. And suddenly having it all spelled out in legal jargon made it feel even bigger and scarier. It's like, suddenly it wasn't just about finding good parents, it was about paperwork and rights and...well, it was a lot. Honestly, I just wanted a slice of pie after that conversation. And maybe to listen to The Moldy Peaches really loud.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, look, don't get me wrong, she seems...nice. Like, aggressively nice. The kind of nice that makes you wonder what she's hiding under all the Pottery Barn perfection. But wanting a kid *that* badly? It's a little intense, you know? Like, chill. Kids are people, not accessories to complete your life aesthetic. \n\nIt's not that I don't *get* wanting a family, or whatever. But she's got this whole...project vibe going on. Like she's building a family from a catalog. And honestly? That kinda freaks me out a little. It feels...calculated. \n\nI mean, I didn't *plan* this. It just...happened. And now I'm trying to do the most responsible thing, which is letting someone who's actually ready, and *wants* this in a healthy way, raise the kid. Vanessa seems ready, I guess. Just...a little *too* ready. It's like she's been practicing for this her whole life. Which, okay, good for her. But it's still weird.\n\nIt makes me think a lot about what a kid actually *needs*, you know? Not just a perfect nursery and organic snacks, but someone who's gonna be there, flaws and all. Someone who's gonna let them be messy and make mistakes. I hope she can do that. I really do. Because this isn't about fulfilling a dream, it's about a little person.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Don't even *get* me started on Mark. Honestly, the whole thing was... a lot. Like, he was trying *so* hard to be all mature and responsible, you know? All \"I'm ready for this, I've been thinking about this since I was a kid,\" and the whole nine yards. \n\nIt felt... rehearsed. Like he'd been watching a lot of those cheesy father-daughter commercials during the daytime. Which, okay, good for him for *thinking* about it, I guess. But it didn't feel... genuine. It felt like he was trying to convince *himself* more than anyone else. \n\nAnd the guitar thing? Seriously? Bringing out the guitar to prove he's sensitive? That's just... a move. A *move*. Like, \"Look at me, I'm a sensitive artist, I can totally handle a baby!\" \n\nVan, though... Van was way more real. He just kinda... *was*. He didn't need to *perform* being a dad. He just seemed like he'd be... good at it. Which, you know, is kinda important when you're picking someone to raise your kid.\n\nSo yeah, Mark's response? A little much. A little try-hard. A little... Mark.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the Loring's house. Don't even *get* me started. It's not like they're *bad* people, okay? Mark and Vanessa are...intense. Like, aggressively wholesome. It's just...everything is so *perfect*. You know? Like a Pottery Barn catalog threw up in there. \n\nAnd it's *quiet*. Unnaturally quiet. Like, you could hear a dust bunny sneeze. I'm used to a little chaos, a little mess. My dad's a bit of a project guy, always fixing something, and my stepmom, Bren, she's...well, she's Bren. Lots of energy. \n\nBeing in their house feels like I'm on display, like I'm supposed to be admiring their perfectly coordinated throw pillows or something. And they *watch* you. Not in a creepy way, exactly, but like they're assessing your level of domesticity. Which, let's be real, is pretty low. I'm not exactly known for my dusting skills. \n\nIt just makes me feel...suffocated. Like I have to be someone I'm not. And honestly, when you're already dealing with, you know, *everything*, you just want to be able to be yourself, even if \"yourself\" is a sarcastic teenager who prefers Converse to sensible shoes.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep breaths. It's...complicated, alright? People keep saying \"gift of life\" like I'm handing over a freakin' puppy or something. It's a *person*, you know? A tiny human I'm currently housing and who's kicking my internal organs with alarming regularity. \n\nBut, like, I'm not exactly equipped to *be* a person's person, if that makes sense. I'm sixteen. I still haven't figured out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raise a whole other one. \n\nMark and Vanessa...they *want* this. Really want it. They can give this kid a life I just...can't. A house with a yard, two parents who are actually, you know, *ready* for this. They're kinda dorky, sure, Vanessa with her whole vintage aesthetic and Mark with his obsession with music, but they're good people. And they seem genuinely excited.\n\nSo, yeah, it feels good knowing it's going to people who will love it and take care of it. It doesn't make it *easy*, though. It's still...weird. Like, I'm growing a little person for someone else. It's a lot to process, even for someone who's pretty good at compartmentalizing, which, let me tell you, is a skill I've been honing lately.\n\n\n\nIt's not a \"gift\" in the sense of, like, a sparkly present. It's more like...making a really hard choice, and hoping it's the right one. And hoping that little kid doesn't grow up to be a total jerk. No offense to future jerks, but, you know.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Don't even *get* me started on Mark. It wasn't even the \"ASAP\" itself, okay? It was the *way* he said it. Like he was some super important executive or something. Like, dude, you sell furniture. And not even fancy furniture, like Pottery Barn stuff. More like...the stuff your grandma has. \n\nHe was trying so hard to be all grown-up and efficient, and it just came off as\u2026 pathetic, honestly. It's not a real word, you know? It's just people being lazy and wanting things *now*. And he said it with this really intense look, like I was holding up the entire operation by asking a simple question about the adoption paperwork. \n\nHonestly, it just felt like a good opportunity for a little\u2026 deflation. Someone had to bring him down a peg. Plus, it's funny. Everything's funnier when you point out the ridiculousness of things. It's a coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *guitars* right now? Like, people are asking me about, you know... *life* stuff, and you wanna know about my axe? Fine. Whatever. It's a good distraction, I guess.\n\nAnyway, it's a vintage Harmony Sovereign H1265. Don't even *try* to act like you know what that is. It's not one of those fancy, show-offy guitars. It's... solid. A little beat up, kinda like me, honestly. I got it at a pawn shop for, like, seventy bucks. \n\nSee, I don't need something all shiny and new to make good music. It's about the sound, right? And this thing has a really warm, kinda melancholy sound. Perfect for writing songs about, you know, awkwardness and existential dread and... stuff. Plus, it's got a good weight to it. Feels good in your hands. \n\nPaul (you'll meet him, he's... a lot) tried to get me a Fender, said it was \"more professional.\" Please. Like I'm trying to be a rock star. I just wanna play. The Harmony feels *real*. It feels like *me*. And honestly, anything that feels like *me* these days is a win.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? This is *still* coming up? It's not like I was trying to pass myself off as a groupie or something. It just...happened.\n\nSee, Paulie Bleeker, he's kinda...intense about music. And the Melvins? They're, like, *his* band. So when Mark and Vanessa were talking about them, and I had absolutely no clue who they were beyond a vaguely unpleasant name, I panicked. It felt like a test, you know? Like they were trying to figure out if I was \"worthy\" of giving them their baby. \n\nAnd honestly? I didn't want them to think I was some clueless, pop-music-obsessed teenager. I wanted to seem...sophisticated. Like I had *taste*. Which is ridiculous, I know. I mean, I listen to The Moldy Peaches! But in the moment, it just felt like the right thing to do. \n\nIt was a dumb lie. A totally dumb lie. And it led to a whole lot of awkwardness involving a record player and a very disappointed Vanessa. But hey, at least it made for a good story, right? Though I'd really rather not revisit it, if you don't mind. It's kinda embarrassing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, it wasn't... *romantic*, you know? Like, not in the way people immediately assume when a girl and a guy hang out. Honestly, it was kinda... comfortable. Weirdly comfortable. He's a bit of a dork, definitely, but a *sweet* dork. \n\nPlaying guitar with him, singing those cheesy songs... it was a distraction, mostly. A good one, though. Like, the world is kinda falling apart around you and you're just trying to remember the chords to \"Anyone Else But You\" or whatever. It was a way to just... *be* for a minute, without having to think about, like, everything. \n\nHe's not exactly the most articulate guy, Mark. He shows how he feels through, like, music and building stuff. Which is... fine. It's just... different. It felt safe, I guess. Like he wasn't judging me, even when I was being a total mess. And he was genuinely excited about the baby, which, you know, was a big deal. It wasn't about *us*, it was about making something good happen for the kid. Does that make sense? It was... a connection built on shared awkwardness and a mutual desire to not completely screw things up.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's not like it's a super deep, philosophical thing, okay? It just...fit. He's kinda boxy and solid, you know? Like Theodore Roosevelt. Plus, he's got this whole \"rough rider\" vibe going on, even though he mostly just sits in my room. \n\nPaul \u2013 that's my stepdad \u2013 he thought it was weird. He's always thinking things are weird. But Bleeker, he *got* it. He said Roosevelt was a president who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty. Which, honestly, is a pretty good description of playing guitar. \n\nIt's just a name. Don't overthink it. It's not like I spent weeks agonizing over it or anything. Though, honestly, picking a name for a *baby* feels way more stressful. Way, *way* more.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Vanessa and Mark. They're...intense. Like, really into the whole \"future parents\" thing already. Which, honestly, is a little weird considering *I'm* still the one carrying around a tiny human and dealing with, like, cravings for weird stuff. Pickles and peanut butter, don't judge.\n\nBut, look, I get it. They *want* to be involved. They're good people, really. A little...perfect, maybe? Like they have a Pinterest board dedicated to nursery themes. It's a lot. \n\nKeeping them updated feels...necessary. It's not like I can just disappear and then show up with a baby. That'd be rude. And probably illegal. So I send them the occasional text, tell them how the appointments went. Mostly I just try to keep it factual. Like, \"Doctor says baby's kicking. Still feels like a tiny fish in my stomach.\" Less about my existential dread, you know?\n\nIt's just...it's *my* body, and *my* decision. And sometimes I feel like they're already planning the kid's life. Like, college fund and soccer practice before the kid even has a name. It's a little suffocating. But I try to remember they're just excited. And honestly, knowing they're gonna be good parents makes the whole thing a little easier to swallow.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah. I keep them in the loop. Just...at arm's length. A very stylish, ironic arm's length.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, well, first of all, \"104%\" is a totally legitimate percentage. Don't even *start* with me on the math. It just... feels more definitive, you know? Like, 100% is good, but it's kinda basic. \n\nBut seriously. Why am I so sure? It's not like I *wanted* this to happen, obviously. I'm sixteen. I'm supposed to be worrying about whether or not Paulie Bleeker will finally notice my new Converse, not... this. \n\nBut the thing is, I've thought about it. A *lot*. And it's not about not wanting a kid, exactly. It's about wanting to give this kid the *best* life. And right now, the best life for this little dude or dudette isn't with me. I'm still figuring out *my* life, you know? I'm barely qualified to pick out a decent movie, let alone raise a human.\n\nMark and Vanessa? They're... good people. Really good. They *want* this. They've been trying for a long time. And they have a beautiful house, and a dog, and they actually know how to cook things that aren't just Easy Mac. \n\nIt's not easy, okay? It's kinda heartbreaking, actually. But it's the right thing. And sometimes, the right thing isn't the easiest thing. It's just... the most responsible. And honestly? I'm surprisingly good at responsible, when I need to be. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. Ruins the whole cynical teen vibe.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on Gerta and Mark. It was...weird. Like, seriously weird. I mean, I get it, right? They were finally getting the baby they wanted. And they were *really* into the whole perfect-family aesthetic. All the Pottery Barn catalogs and the organic everything. It was a whole *thing*.\n\nBut walking out of there, and hearing them already, like, planning nursery themes and baby names...it felt...fast. And kinda\u2026 celebratory *of* me being gone, you know? Not celebratory *for* the baby, but celebratory that *I* wasn't going to be around to mess up their plan. \n\nIt wasn't malicious, I don't think. They were just...focused. And maybe a little relieved. Which, okay, fair enough. But it still felt like I was a package they'd returned, and they were thrilled with the exchange. \n\nIt made me feel\u2026 small. Like a placeholder. Like I was just the vessel, and once the vessel was emptied, poof, no more need for me. Which, obviously, isn't *entirely* true, but that's how it felt in the moment. I just wanted to go home and listen to The Moldy Peaches and eat a peanut butter sandwich. Preferably in silence.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Rumors. Seriously? Like, people have *nothing* better to do with their time than dissect my life and then whisper about it behind cupped hands like they're sharing state secrets? It's\u2026 irritating. Mostly irritating.\n\nIt's not like I *wanted* to be the subject of the North Maplewood High gossip mill, you know? It's not exactly a stellar addition to my rep. I was perfectly content being known for my ironic t-shirt collection and my ability to verbally dismantle anyone who tried to give me unsolicited advice. Now I'm \"that girl.\" \n\nHonestly, the worst part isn't even the talking *to* my face \u2013 though that's pretty bad, especially when it's Brenda \"The Bee\" Blevins trying to offer me pamphlets on\u2026 well, you don't even *want* to know. It's the *staring*. Like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo. \n\nPeople act like pregnancy is this\u2026 alien thing. Like they've never seen it before. It's just\u2026 life happening, okay? And yeah, it happened a little faster for me than most, but it doesn't make me a freak show. \n\nSo, how do I *feel* about the rumors? I feel like I need a really, really big slice of pie. And maybe a strongly worded letter to the entire student body. But mostly, I just want everyone to chill. It's my life, and I'm figuring it out. And frankly, that's enough.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, it's not like... *happy* happy, you know? Like, nobody's exactly throwing a party about it. It's more... complicated. It's like, you spend nine months growing a person *inside* you, which is already pretty weird when you think about it, and then you gotta... not keep them? It's a head trip, seriously.\n\nBut here's the thing. I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast, let alone raising a kid. I mean, I like records and vintage clothes and avoiding gym class. I'm not exactly equipped to provide a stable, financially secure, emotionally fulfilling life for a tiny human. \n\nSo, giving the baby up to Mark and Vanessa? It's... the least worst option. They're, like, *really* wanting a kid. They're nice, they have a house with a yard, and Vanessa makes amazing blueberry muffins, which, honestly, is a good sign. It's not about finding someone \"better\" than me to raise my kid, it's about finding someone who can actually *be* a parent right now. \n\nIt doesn't mean I don't care, okay? It just means I'm being... realistic. And maybe a little selfish. But mostly realistic. It's just... a lot. A whole lot. And honestly, thinking about it too much makes me wanna eat a whole box of Nerds.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, everyone keeps asking me about the whole surprise thing with Mark and Vanessa. It's not some *huge* philosophical statement, alright? It's just...they're really, really prepared. Like, they've got the nursery decorated, the clothes picked out, the whole nine yards. Everything is *blue*. Seriously, it's a Smurf convention waiting to happen.\n\nAnd honestly? I kinda wanted to mess with them a little. They're good people, don't get me wrong. Super nice. But they're also...intense planners. I figured a little curveball, a little \"Oh, hey, it's a girl!\" might be good for them. Force them to, like, *react* instead of just ticking things off a list. \n\nPlus, it felt...right. Like, this baby deserves a little bit of mystery, you know? It's *their* baby, but it started with *me*. And I didn't know what it was 'til pretty late. So letting them experience that same little bit of the unknown felt...fair. \n\nIt's not about wanting drama, okay? It's about letting them have a moment that isn't perfectly orchestrated. A moment that's just...real. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit funny. Because let's be honest, a room full of blue for a girl? That's pretty hilarious.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on that lady. Seriously. Like, I get it, she probably sees a lot of\u2026 situations. But the *tone*, you know? It was all, \"Oh, you're so young, are you *sure* about this?\" and then a whole lecture about how adoption isn't just \"giving a baby away\" like it's a Beanie Baby or something. \n\nIt was just\u2026 presumptuous. Like she thought she knew my life story based on, what, my age and the fact that I was lying on a table having a picture taken of a tiny human growing inside me? Newsflash: not all teenage moms are tragic cases waiting to happen. Some of us actually *think* things through.\n\nAnd the whole adoption thing? I'd already done a ton of research. I knew it wasn't simple. I wasn't just picturing handing over a bundle and walking away. It felt\u2026 disrespectful, you know? Like she was implying I hadn't considered the emotional weight of it all. \n\nHonestly, it just made me want to roll my eyes so hard they got stuck. I mean, I was already dealing with a lot, and I didn't need a stranger judging my choices. It kinda solidified the fact that I needed to find parents who *got* me, who understood I wasn't doing this lightly. It needed to be a good fit, for everyone. And definitely not with someone who thinks they're the expert on my life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, where do I even *begin* with the challenges? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, cool, a baby! Let's just find some nice people and hand it over!\" \n\nFirst off, telling my parents was...intense. My dad, he's a pretty quiet guy, but he got all choked up. My stepmom, Bren, she was surprisingly cool about it, though. She's a good egg, that one. But still, it was awkward. Like, *super* awkward. Explaining to everyone at school was even worse. People just...stared. And whispered. It's like suddenly I was a science experiment or something.\n\nThen there was the whole *finding* the right people thing. It wasn't like browsing a catalog. You're talking about a whole *person*, you know? A tiny human. Mark and Vanessa, they were...different. Really different. And honestly, at first, I was kinda judging them. They were, like, *perfect*. Too perfect. I thought, \"Are these people even *real*?\" It made me question if I was doing the right thing, if they'd actually understand what I was going through.\n\nAnd then, there was just...me. Dealing with all the feelings. Being pregnant is weird. Your body is doing this thing, and you're like, \"Whoa, hold up, this isn't part of the plan.\" And then you start thinking about this little person, and you want the best for them, even if that best doesn't include you. It's a lot to process when you're sixteen and mostly concerned with finding vintage clothes and listening to The Moldy Peaches.\n\nHonestly, the biggest challenge wasn't the physical stuff, or even the judgment. It was figuring out who *I* was, and what *I* wanted, all while growing another human. It's a lot of self-discovery when you're also discovering a bun in the oven, let me tell you.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts time. Don't get me wrong, I still think romantic love is mostly just\u2026overrated. Like, all those movies? Total garbage. But *this*\u2026 this isn't about finding a boyfriend or whatever. It's about wanting something good for someone, even if that someone isn't *with* you. Which is weird, right? I mean, I'm giving a baby away, and that's supposed to be the opposite of love, I guess. But it feels\u2026right. Like, the best kind of love is letting go, even when it totally sucks.\n\nResponsibility? Oh, man. Before, responsibility was like, doing my homework and not failing history. Now it's\u2026bigger. It's realizing that actions have consequences, and that those consequences aren't always about *you*. It's about this little person who didn't ask to be here, and making sure they have a good life. It's less about what *I* want and more about what's best for *him* or *her*. It's kinda terrifying, honestly.\n\nAnd growing up? Forget about it. I thought I was pretty mature for sixteen. I liked old movies, I played guitar, I wasn't obsessed with, like, sparkly vampires. But this\u2026 this is a whole different level of grown-up. It's realizing that life isn't some neat little story with a happy ending tied up with a bow. It's messy and complicated and sometimes really, really hard. \n\nIt's also made me realize that adults aren't always as together as they seem. Like, Mark and Vanessa? They're trying so hard to be perfect, but they're just as confused as I am. Maybe even more so. It's kinda comforting, in a weird way. \n\nSo yeah, it's changed things. A lot. I'm still figuring it all out, obviously. But I think\u2026 I think I'm okay with that. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be a little bit lost. As long as you're trying to do the right thing, I guess.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, everyone in town is obsessed with that living room set. It's seriously weird. It just... appeared. One day it was a normal, kinda sad-looking lawn, the next BAM! Full-on, perfectly arranged living room. Couch, armchair, coffee table, even a little lamp. Like someone just *decided* that's where a living room should be.\n\nHonestly? It's kinda fascinating. It's like a little pocket of domesticity just... plopped down in the middle of nowhere. Bleaker than my dad's attempts at decorating, and *that's* saying something. \n\nBut mostly, I think it's a statement. Like, someone's trying to say something about, I don't know, the illusion of the perfect family or something. Or maybe they just had a really good deal on furniture. It's hard to tell with people. They're complicated. Especially adults. \n\nPlus, Paulie Bleeker thinks it's a good spot for, like, philosophical discussions. Which is... a thing. So, yeah, I'm interested. It's a good place to people-watch, and sometimes you can get a decent burger from the diner and eat it on the porch swing. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin the mystique.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Still thinking about the Wizard. That guy was\u2026 a lot. And creepy. Like, a *lot* creepy.\n\nWhen he said that, all whispery and intense, \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\"... it wasn't about *me*, okay? It wasn't like he was thrilled to meet *Juno MacGuff*, the witty, independent girl with a penchant for Super Nintendo. No. It was about the baby. \n\nHe and Vanessa, they wanted a kid for *so* long. Like, years. Vanessa couldn't... well, she couldn't have one herself. So he was talking about finally getting the chance to be a dad. It was kinda sad, actually, when you think about it. A little pathetic, even. But also... I guess understandable? People want things. \n\nIt just felt weird coming from *him*, you know? He was all\u2026 intense collector vibes with his records and his basement. It made the whole thing feel less about wanting a family and more about wanting to *complete* something. Like a rare vinyl. \n\nHonestly, it still gives me the shivers a little. But I knew, right then, that they were serious. And that they would be good parents. Even if the dad was a little\u2026off.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about the *juice container*? Like that's the important part of the whole thing? Honestly.\n\nLook, it wasn't just *any* juice container. It was a Super Big Gulp, okay? And after... well, after finding out about the whole baby situation with Paulie Bleeker, I needed something. Something sugary and distracting. And then I realized, walking home, that it was just... sitting there. A monument to my questionable life choices. Dramatic, I know. But it felt right to just *fling* it. \n\nAnd then, naturally, I needed a pregnancy test. Like, duh. Dancing Elk was the closest place. Mr. Elk is kinda weird, always trying to sell you homeopathic remedies for everything, but they have the tests. Plus, it's not like I was gonna go to, like, Walgreens. Too mainstream. \n\nIt was a whole process, okay? A very emotionally charged process involving a large plastic container and a desperate need for confirmation. Don't judge. It's not like anyone *plans* on this kind of thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Don't *even* get me started on that. Seriously. Like, what kind of question *is* that? I was just trying to find some prenatal vitamins \u2013 you know, being responsible and stuff, even though it's, like, totally weird to be responsible at sixteen \u2013 and this woman, this *Tough Girl* as you put it, just corners me in the aisle. \n\nShe's all, sizing me up, and then just blurts it out. \"Are those real brown?\" Like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo. I mean, hello? Personal space? And honestly, what does the *color* of my nipples have to do with anything? It's just...rude. \n\nI think she was trying to, like, assess my \"maturity\" or something, probably deciding if I was a good candidate for...well, for being pregnant. It was just so judgmental. I just kinda stared at her and said, \"I don't know, they feel pretty real to me.\" Which, looking back, was probably a pretty good comeback, if I do say so myself. \n\nPeople just assume a lot when they see a girl my age with a bump. It's annoying. It's like, yeah, I'm pregnant, okay? But I'm still *me*. And my nipples are my business.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Leah. Don't even get me *started*. Not in a bad way, though. Honestly, I probably would've completely imploded without her. Like, seriously. Picture a supernova of awkwardness and teenage angst \u2013 that would've been me.\n\nSee, Leah's... well, she's *Leah*. Super into everything, super enthusiastic, always has a craft project going. Which, normally, I'd roll my eyes at. But when I found out about the baby, she was the first person I told, besides Paul, obviously. And she didn't freak. She didn't judge. She just... started knitting.\n\nLike, immediately. A tiny, ridiculously adorable hat. It was kinda overwhelming, actually. But it was also... nice. It meant she was already thinking about the baby, even before I'd really processed it myself. \n\nShe was the one who dragged me to the doctor, you know? I was just kinda hoping it would all go away if I ignored it. Leah doesn't *do* ignoring things. She's all about facing stuff head-on, even if it's terrifying. And she was the one who found the ad, the one with Mark and Vanessa. I wouldn't have even *looked* at something like that. Too\u2026 earnest.\n\nHonestly, she was my emotional support system, my research assistant, and my designated tiny-hat-knitter all rolled into one. She kept me from spiraling into a total mess. Plus, she made me laugh, which was crucial. Because, let's be real, the whole situation was pretty ridiculous. And sometimes, you just need a friend to laugh *with* you, not *at* you.\n\nSo yeah, Leah was\u2026 important. More important than I probably let on at the time. She's a good egg, that one. A little intense, maybe, but a good egg.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that*. Honestly? It wasn't some grand, thoughtful gesture, alright? It was mostly... desperation, mixed with a healthy dose of wanting to see if they'd, like, completely freak out. I mean, Mark and Vanessa are... *particular*. Very Pottery Barn. Very \"perfect life\" aesthetic. \n\nI figured showing them the ultrasound \u2013 the little blurry blob, you know? \u2013 would be a good test. Like, would they still want a kid knowing it was *real* real? Not just a concept they'd picked out from a brochure. Would they still be all \"rustic charm\" and \"organic cotton\" when faced with, well, a tiny human starting to form?\n\nPlus, I kinda needed to see *their* reaction. It was weirdly important to me to know they weren't just doing this because it was the \"right\" thing to do, or because it would look good. I wanted to see if they actually *wanted* this kid. \n\nIt was a gamble, I admit. A slightly manipulative gamble. But sometimes you gotta poke the bear a little, you know? Just to see if it's a real bear, or just a really fluffy dog in a bear costume. And honestly, seeing their faces... it was worth it. It told me a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Honestly? It was...not surprising. Like, not at *all*. Mark is...well, Mark. Sweet, definitely. But also kinda clueless, you know? He's the type to leave a note on the fridge saying \"Gone to the library! Be back eventually!\" and then wander off to a record store for six hours. \n\nSo when he was all, \"Vanessa isn't here,\" I just kinda raised an eyebrow and thought, \"Yeah, no kidding.\" It wasn't like I expected a full-blown welcome committee or anything. I mean, the whole situation was already...complicated. Finding out *he* was the father was complicated. Finding out *she* wasn't even around to, like, acknowledge the complicated-ness? Just felt about par for the course.\n\nIt mostly just made me feel...awkward. Like, I was intruding on his life, and he was clearly trying to navigate a situation he wasn't equipped for. It's not like I was thrilled to be there, either. It was a whole mess of uncomfortable, and honestly, I just wanted to get it over with. You know? Sometimes people just aren't ready for real life, and Vanessa definitely struck me as one of those people.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that*. Honestly? It wasn't even a fully formed thought, it just kinda...escaped. It's just, like, Mark's all earnest and sensitive and writing music that's, you know, *real*. And then he's selling out to, like, car commercials? It felt...disjointed. Like a really bad mix tape. \n\nIt's not that I think making money is *wrong*, okay? I get it. Rent's a thing. But it felt like he was compromising something important to him, and I just...reacted. I tend to deflect with sarcasm, it's a coping mechanism, alright? Especially when things are feeling weird and complicated, which, let's be real, everything was feeling weird and complicated at that point. \n\nPlus, it was a pretty cheesy commercial. Seriously. Like, aggressively cheesy. It deserved a little ribbing. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Don't even *get* me started. It was... a lot. Like, the guy went totally pale, then started rambling about how he needed to \"re-evaluate his life choices.\" Re-evaluate? Seriously? We were looking at a little bean on a screen, not deciding whether to buy a timeshare. \n\nHonestly? It felt kinda\u2026 lonely. I mean, I knew he wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, but I didn't expect him to look like I'd just told him the world was flat. It made me realize pretty quick that this wasn't something *we* were going to figure out together, you know? It was going to be... me figuring it out. \n\nIt wasn't like I was expecting a parade or anything, but a little \"Wow, that's... something\" would have been nice. Instead, it was just this awkward silence and him staring into the middle distance like he was trying to remember where he parked his car. \n\nIt kinda solidified things, actually. Like, okay, this is happening, and I need to be okay with that, even if *he* isn't. It's just... sometimes people aren't ready for real life, you know? And sometimes, you gotta be the grown-up, even when you're, like, sixteen and still trying to figure out what a 401k is.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Havenbrooke. Honestly, the whole *vibe* of that place was\u2026intense. Like, aggressively pro-life. Lots of pictures of babies, you know? And pamphlets. So. Many. Pamphlets. It felt less like a medical clinic and more like a guilt trip waiting to happen.\n\nLook, it wasn't like I *wanted* to be pregnant, okay? It was\u2026unexpected. And yeah, abortion was definitely on the table. I mean, it felt like the logical thing, right? I was sixteen, barely able to handle algebra, let alone a human being. \n\nBut being *there*, at Havenbrooke, with all that\u2026pressure\u2026it just felt wrong. Not morally wrong, necessarily, but wrong for *me*. It felt like they were trying to tell me what to feel, what to do, instead of letting me figure it out myself. And honestly, I hate being told what to do. It's, like, my defining characteristic.\n\nPlus, the counselor kept talking about \"the sanctity of life\" and I was just thinking, \"Lady, have you *seen* the world? Sanctity of life is a little hard to find sometimes.\" \n\nIt wasn't a decision I took lightly, okay? It was\u2026complicated. But ultimately, I realized I couldn't go through with it. Not because of them, or their pictures, but because\u2026well, it felt like giving up on something before I even really knew what it was. And I'm not really a quitter. Even if quitting would have been a whole lot easier.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, look. This is\u2026awkward. Like, *super* awkward. It's not exactly something I volunteer information about, you know? It's not like we sat down and had a whole \"Let's discuss the ramifications of unprotected sex\" conversation. That would be\u2026intense. And not really *us*.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I\u2026we'd been friends since, like, forever. Elementary school forever. He was always just *there*. Quiet, kinda dorky, really good at guitar. He wasn't, like, the popular type, and honestly, neither was I. We just\u2026clicked. We bonded over a shared love of bad horror movies and avoiding gym class. \n\nIt happened after a movie marathon at his house. We were both kinda\u2026feeling things, I guess. It wasn't some grand romantic gesture or anything. It was just\u2026impulsive. A moment. A really, *really* poorly timed moment, as it turns out. \n\nHonestly, I think we were both just trying to figure stuff out, and we figured it out the wrong way. It wasn't about love, not at first. It was\u2026 curiosity, I guess. And maybe a little bit of boredom. Don't judge. Teenagers are bored people.\n\nIt's funny, because now, looking back, it feels so\u2026naive. Like, we were kids playing at being adults. And then, well, then I found out I wasn't playing anymore. It was real. And suddenly, everything got a whole lot more complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, *how* did I feel? That's a loaded question, right? It wasn't exactly a party in my uterus, let me tell you. It wasn't like I was planning on, you know, popping out a kid with the drummer from a band whose name sounds like a skin condition. Bleeker... honestly, he's sweet, but not exactly Mensa material. \n\nAt first? Mostly just... overwhelmed. And a little bit panicked. Like, seriously panicked. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about getting into a decent college, not, like, gestational diabetes and tiny socks. It felt\u2026 weird. Like my life had suddenly been hijacked by a tiny human.\n\nBut then, after the initial freak-out, it kinda settled into\u2026 well, it was just *there*. It was happening. And I figured, okay, I can't change it, so I gotta figure out what to *do* about it. And that meant finding the right parents. Not just anyone. Someone who would actually *want* him, you know? Someone who could give him a good life. \n\nIt wasn't about *liking* being pregnant, because, honestly, heartburn is the enemy. It was about doing the right thing. Even if the right thing was, like, the hardest thing. And also, trying to find a really good playlist to distract myself from the whole situation. Music helps, you know? A lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so telling Paulie... Bleeker, I mean. It wasn't exactly a cinematic moment, you know? No slow-motion, no dramatic music. Just...awkward. Really, *really* awkward.\n\nI found him after school, by the bike racks, naturally. He was trying to look cool leaning against them, all slouchy and brooding, probably thinking about some obscure indie band. And I just...blurted it out. Like ripping off a band-aid, except the band-aid was my entire future. \n\n\"So, uh, remember that time we...you know?\" I said, which, looking back, was a *stellar* way to start a conversation about impending parenthood. He just blinked at me, looking like a deer caught in headlights. Then I dropped the bomb. \"Well, I'm pregnant.\"\n\nHe went totally pale. Like, legitimately lost all color. He mumbled something about needing to sit down, which, fair enough. I think he thought I was messing with him at first. Like, this was some elaborate prank. Which, honestly, considering my usual level of sarcasm, wasn't entirely unreasonable.\n\nThe whole thing was just...quiet. He didn't yell, he didn't freak out, he just...looked *lost*. And honestly, that was almost worse. It wasn't the reaction I expected. I figured he'd be all dramatic, maybe even angry. But he was just...sad. And confused. \n\nIt took a while for him to process it, and honestly, it took a while for *me* to process it too, even *after* I'd already said the words. It wasn't a happy moment, not by a long shot. But it was...real. And that's what mattered, I guess.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, that's a *big* question. It wasn't...easy. People think it's just, you know, hand the baby over and boom, everything's fine. It's not. It's way more complicated than that. \n\nHonestly? At first, it was mostly just...panic. Like, full-blown, \"my life is over and I'm gonna be stuck changing diapers forever\" panic. But then I started thinking, and talking to my dad, and Bleeker (he's...a musician, kinda), and mostly just *thinking*, and I realized keeping it wasn't really an option. Not for me, and definitely not for the baby. I was still in high school! I was barely figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raising a whole person.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, see? It was about wanting the baby to have a good life. A *better* life, maybe. And Mark and Vanessa, the couple I chose...they were amazing. They were, like, genuinely excited and ready. They weren't just looking for a baby, they were looking for *this* baby. \n\nIt still stung, though. A lot. Even knowing it was the right thing. It's weird, you know? Carrying a kid, feeling it kick...it's a really intense connection. And then you consciously choose to...not raise it. It's not something you just *get over*. \n\nBut I figured, the best thing I could do was make sure it was a good situation. And I did. And that, I think, made it...okay. Mostly. It's still something I think about, obviously. But I try to focus on the fact that I gave that little kid a chance at a really good life. And that's...something.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so people *always* ask me this. Like, my musical taste defines my entire personality or something. It's kinda reductive, honestly. But fine. I'll indulge.\n\nIt's...varied. I'm not one of those people who's like, \"Oh, I *only* listen to indie folk.\" That's just...limiting. I mean, The Moldy Peaches are essential. Don't even *try* to argue with me on that. They just *get* awkwardness, you know? \n\nBut then I also dig stuff like Cat Power, and Belle & Sebastian. Real mellow stuff for when I'm, like, contemplating the universe or whatever. And sometimes, when I need to just...blast everything, I'll put on some early Sonic Youth. It's good for feeling angsty, which, let's be real, happens a lot.\n\nOh, and don't forget The Velvet Underground. My dad's got a whole bunch of their records. He's kinda a hipster before hipsters were even a thing. \n\nBasically, if it's a little bit weird and a little bit honest, I'm probably into it. It's gotta have *something* to it, you know? No bubblegum pop for this girl. That stuff just feels...fake.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. \"The Wizard of Gore\"? Seriously? Okay, look, I get that Paulie likes his\u2026 *intense* cinema. Like, really intense. And I appreciate a good, cheesy scare as much as the next person, especially if it's ironic. But that movie? That's just\u2026 a lot. \n\nIt's not even *good* bad, you know? It's just\u2026 bad. Like, the special effects look like they were done by a particularly enthusiastic kindergartener with a lot of ketchup. And the whole premise? A wizard who kills people on TV? It's trying too hard to be shocking. It feels desperate. \n\nHonestly, it's the kind of movie you watch with a group of people and spend the whole time making fun of it. Which, okay, that *can* be fun. But it doesn't hold up on its own. It's like a really awkward date \u2013 you might laugh *at* it, but you definitely won't be thinking about it tomorrow.\n\nPlus, it kinda gave me the creeps. And I'm already dealing with enough life changes right now without adding a wizard who dismembers people with a chainsaw to the mix. Just sayin'.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Madison. Seriously? It's...fine, I guess. Like, perfectly *fine*. Which is the problem, you know? It's so...beige. It's the name you give a doll when you can't think of anything better. It feels like it should be paired with a matching headband and a tiny purse. \n\nNot that there's anything *wrong* with beige, per se. Some people *like* beige. But a name? It needs a little...oomph. A little something to make it stick in your brain. Like, a good song needs a killer guitar riff, you know? Madison is more like elevator music.\n\nLook, I'm not saying it's the *worst* name ever. But if you're looking for something with personality, something that says \"I'm a unique individual,\" you might wanna keep looking. Just my two cents. And believe me, I've been thinking a *lot* about names lately. It's kinda important when you're, uh, you know...in the situation I'm in.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, people always make it sound *so* dramatic, right? \"Giving up\" a baby. It feels\u2026loaded. Like I'm just casually returning something to the store that doesn't fit. Which, honestly, sometimes it feels like my life *is* just a series of things that don't quite fit.\n\nBut seriously, it's not about *giving up*. It's about\u2026 wanting something *better*. For the kid, obviously. I mean, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I still haven't figured out what I want for *breakfast*, let alone a whole human life. I can barely keep a houseplant alive, and you want me to raise a tiny person? No thanks. \n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not like I don't feel *something*. It's just\u2026 I know I'm not ready. And honestly, I think it's kinda selfless, you know? Like, recognizing your limitations and doing what's best, even if it sucks for *you*. \n\nMark and Vanessa, they seem\u2026 good. Really good. Like, actual grown-ups who have their stuff together. They want a kid, and I\u2026 well, I have a lot of mixtapes to make and a life to figure out. It's not ideal, but it feels\u2026 right. As right as anything feels when you're staring down the barrel of a pregnancy test, anyway.\n\nIt's not a happy thing, exactly. It's just\u2026 a *real* thing. And sometimes, real life is messy and complicated and doesn't come with a neat little bow on top. You just gotta deal with it, I guess.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, it's not like anyone *prepares* you for this, you know? Like, they tell you about puberty and awkward dances and trying to figure out if that guy in history actually *likes* you, or if he's just being nice because your mom baked cookies for the class. But nobody mentions the whole\u2026 accidental baby thing.\n\nHonestly? It's mostly just compartmentalizing. Like, one minute I'm stressing about a pop quiz in bio, the next I'm trying to figure out if I should get the organic apples or the regular ones because, apparently, what I eat matters now. It's exhausting. \n\nAnd the pressure? Oh, *the pressure*. Everyone has an opinion. My mom, bless her heart, is trying to be supportive but also keeps subtly hinting at all the life changes. Blech. Then there's the school thing \u2013 whispers, stares, the whole shebang. It's like suddenly I'm a science experiment everyone's observing.\n\nBut you kinda just\u2026 deal. I mean, what else are you gonna do? Curl up in a ball and cry? I did that for, like, a day. It wasn't productive. So, I just try to be\u2026 normal. As normal as a pregnant sixteen-year-old *can* be, I guess. I still listen to The Moldy Peaches, I still hang out with Paulie and Leah, I still try to avoid Mr. Hetrick in the hallway. \n\nIt helps to have a plan, too. Knowing I'm giving the baby to Mark and Vanessa, people who are actually *ready* for a kid? That makes it\u2026 less scary. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it feel like I'm doing something responsible, even if it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nBasically, it's a lot of deep breaths, a lot of sarcastic comments to deflect, and a whole lot of hoping I don't accidentally trip and fall on my face in front of the entire school. It's a mess, but it's *my* mess. And I'm figuring it out. Slowly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, that's... a big question. Like, existential crisis big. Honestly? It's a constant struggle. I *like* being self-sufficient, you know? I like figuring things out on my own, not having to rely on anyone. It feels... cleaner, I guess. Less messy. \n\nBut then, you get thrown a curveball like... well, like *this* whole situation, and suddenly \"clean\" goes right out the window. You realize you can't exactly build a human being all by yourself. Or navigate the whole adoption thing, or even just, like, deal with the fact that your life has done a complete 180.\n\nSo, you swallow your pride. Which is *hard*, let me tell you. It's like admitting you're not a superhero, even though you totally feel like you should be. You let people help. My dad, he's... well, he's my dad. He's goofy, but he's always there. And Bren, even though she's a total drama queen sometimes, she's a good friend. And Paulie... okay, Paulie's a bit of a mess, but he tries. \n\nIt's about picking your battles, I think. Knowing when to say \"I got this\" and when to say \"Okay, I clearly do *not* got this, someone please help.\" It doesn't make you weak, it just makes you... human. And sometimes, letting people in is the strongest thing you can do. Even if it feels totally weird and uncomfortable. Especially if it feels totally weird and uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so, at first? It was...awkward. Like, *super* awkward. You know, one minute you're bonding over The Cure and feeling all angsty-teenager vibes, and the next minute you've, uh, made a baby. It's not exactly a smooth transition. He was...sweet, I guess. In a quiet, kinda dorky way. He tried, you know? Brought me orange juice and stuff when I was feeling nauseous, which was nice, even if it was the kind with pulp. *Pulp*. Seriously.\n\nBut he wasn't exactly equipped to deal with, like, *life*. He was still figuring out his own stuff, playing guitar, trying to get good grades. And I get that. But suddenly needing to talk about things like, \"Okay, so we're gonna have a baby, what are we gonna *do*?\" was a lot for him. He kinda retreated into himself, which, honestly, was frustrating. \n\nIt wasn't that he didn't care, it was just...he processed things differently. He wasn't gonna be all dramatic and emotional about it, you know? He just...was. And eventually, I realized that was okay. He showed up for the important stuff, like the doctor's appointments and stuff with Mark and Vanessa. He wasn't the one making all the big decisions, but he was *there*. \n\nWe didn't end up as, like, a couple or anything. That wasn't really the point. But we ended up being...friends. Sort of. Friends who made a baby and then gave it to a really awesome couple. It's a weird sentence when you say it out loud. But yeah, it changed. It started awkward, went kinda quiet, and ended up...respectful, I guess. We both grew up a little, even if he still prefers orange juice with pulp. Don't even get me started on that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? This is like, the *first* question people ask. It's not some deep, philosophical thing, alright? My dad... he's kinda into mythology. Like, *really* into it. He and my stepmom, Bren, were naming me and he was going on and on about how Juno was, like, the queen of the gods and a protector of marriage and stuff. \n\nHonestly, I mostly tuned him out. I was a baby. But apparently, he thought it was ironic, considering he and my biological mom weren't exactly a picture of marital bliss. He said it was a \"statement.\" \n\nWhatever. It's a name. It's not like I *chose* it. Though, honestly, sometimes I think it fits. I mean, I *am* pretty boss, even if I don't have a whole lot of interest in protecting anyone's marriage. Mostly I just protect my own space and try to avoid awkward conversations. Which, let's be real, is a full-time job.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Vanessa. Right. Honestly? It was...weird. Like, I was expecting a whole *thing*, you know? Tears, maybe a dramatic fainting spell. She's, like, super put-together, always has a plan. So when she just...breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the picture? It threw me. \n\nShe said something about needing to *know* it was actually happening, that it wasn't just some weird dream. Which, okay, fair enough, I guess. Being pregnant is pretty surreal. But it also felt...distant, you know? Like she was already processing it as something to *manage* instead of, like, a tiny human growing inside of me.\n\nIt made me think about how different we are, her and I. She's got her whole life mapped out, the perfect house, the perfect husband, the perfect everything. And me? I'm just trying to figure out what I want for lunch most days. It was a good reminder that this whole adoption thing wasn't just about *me* giving a baby away. It was about giving a baby to a family who was ready for it, in their own way. Even if their \"ready\" looks a little...composed.\n\nIt's just...people are complicated, you know? And pregnancy? That's a whole other level of complicated. Don't even get me started on Mark and his whole existential crisis. Seriously.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't *even* get me started on Vanessa's mom, Brenda. Seriously, that woman is a whole *mood*. Like, a really intense, floral-print, passive-aggressive mood. \n\nOkay, so picture this: I'm chillin' with Vanessa, we're listening to The Moldy Peaches, and suddenly Brenda just *appears*. It wasn't a graceful entrance, either. More like a tactical strike. And the look on her face? Like I'd personally insulted her entire life choices.\n\nShe went straight for the \"you're a bad influence\" speech, which, honestly, is pretty rich coming from someone who decorates her house entirely with porcelain dolls. It's creepy, Brenda, seriously. Anyway, I just kinda... stared her down. I figured if I looked bored enough, she'd run out of steam. \n\nI think my exact words were something along the lines of, \"Look, I get it. You're protective. But Vanessa and I are friends. And frankly, your house smells like potpourri and judgment.\" \n\nIt didn't *completely* diffuse the situation, but it definitely threw her off. She sputtered a bit, then launched into a whole thing about my \"lifestyle\" and how I needed to \"think about my future.\" Which, ironic, considering *my* future was currently kicking inside me.\n\nI mostly just kept repeating, \"Okay,\" and nodding slowly. It's a good tactic. Makes people think you're listening when you're really just mentally composing a haiku about the absurdity of it all. Eventually, she just huffed and went to yell at her husband, probably about how I was ruining Vanessa's chances of getting into a good college. \n\nHonestly, dealing with Brenda was good practice for dealing with... well, everything that was happening. You gotta learn to just roll with the crazy, you know? And sometimes, a well-timed, slightly sarcastic comment is the best defense.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not exactly a super fun story, you know? It's not like I *wanted* to be pregnant, first of all. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was mostly concerned with finding the perfect vintage dress and figuring out if Paulie Bleeker was actually noticing me, not, like, raising a human. \n\nAnd honestly? I just... wasn't ready. It's not that I thought I couldn't *handle* it, exactly. It's more that I knew the baby deserved parents who were, like, *fully* ready. Parents who had their stuff together. Parents who weren't still in high school and whose biggest life decision up to that point was whether to get extra cheese on their tater tots. \n\nMark and Vanessa, they were... different. They *wanted* a baby, really wanted one, and they had a beautiful house and a stable life. It just felt... right. Like, the least messed up option in a pretty messed up situation. \n\nIt wasn't easy, don't get me wrong. It's still not easy, thinking about it. But it felt like the most selfless thing I could do. And sometimes, you gotta do the selfless thing, even if it kinda sucks for you. Plus, I figured I had enough drama in my life already. One less tiny human needing a diaper change felt like a win.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on lab partners. Honestly? It's a whole thing. See, I'm not, like, actively *trying* to be a deadbeat. It's just... my brain kinda wanders. Like, you're supposed to be dissecting a frog or something, and I'm over here contemplating the existential dread of being a frog, you know? Or wondering if the formaldehyde fumes are giving me superpowers. \n\nAnd then I get distracted by, like, the *patterns* in the tile floor, or the way Mr. Burns' comb-over defies gravity. It's not that I don't *care* about science, it's just... everything else is so much more *interesting*. \n\nPlus, Paulie, my usual partner, is... well, he's Paulie. He gets really intense about the scientific method and judges my tangents. It's exhausting. So yeah, I end up letting him do most of the work while I provide moral support and witty commentary. Which, let's be real, is a valuable contribution. It's just not the kind they grade you on.\n\nBasically, I'm a philosophical observer in a world obsessed with frogs. It's a tough life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Seriously? Another dramatic episode in the petri dish of high school? Look, I've seen enough passive-aggressive note-passing and eye-rolling to last me a lifetime, and honestly, lab partners fighting is *so* clich\u00e9. It's like, did nobody watch \"The Breakfast Club\"? \n\nIt usually boils down to one of two things, right? Either he's not pulling his weight and she's doing all the work, which, okay, I get being annoyed about that. Like, contribute, dude! Or, he thinks she's being a control freak. Which, okay, *some* girls can be. Not naming names, obviously.\n\nBut honestly, the whole thing is just... exhausting. Like, can't people just *do* the lab and then go back to obsessing over whatever band is currently on their LiveJournal? It's a lab, not a life-or-death situation. Unless they're messing with something really dangerous, in which case, maybe I should just walk away. I've got enough drama in my own life right now, thanks very much. \n\nIt's probably something stupid, like who gets to use the Bunsen burner first. Honestly, the priorities of some people... it's baffling.\n\n\n\n", "Whoa, hold your horses. \"Hasty abortion\"? That's... a really loaded way to put it. It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Ooh, let's just *get rid* of it!\" It's a little more complicated than that, okay?\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I spend most of my time trying to figure out if I should wear Converse or beat-up boots with my jeans, not raising a human. And honestly? My life is... not exactly set up for a baby. My dad's a handyman, my stepmom's obsessed with wreaths, and I'm mostly just trying to survive high school without completely losing my cool. \n\nIt's not that I don't think babies are cool. They're... squishy. And they smell weird. But they also need, like, *everything*. And I can barely keep my own life organized, let alone another person's. \n\nSo, yeah, I was thinking about an abortion. But then I started thinking... maybe there's another way. A better way. It's not a decision I'm taking lightly, okay? It's just... a lot to process. And honestly, it's kinda terrifying.\n\n\n\nDon't go judging me, though. It's my body, my life, and my problem. And frankly, I'm trying to figure it out the best way *I* can.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *Boone's*? Like, that's the big question of the day? Whatever. But fine, I'll indulge you. It's not even close, honestly. \n\nSee, all the other flavors are just... trying too hard. They're like those kids in high school who wear way too much eyeliner and think they're mysterious. The Strawberry Kiwi? Way too sweet. The Mango? Just\u2026wrong. \n\nBut Snow Peak Peach? It's subtle. It's got this kinda\u2026 wistful quality. It's not screaming for attention, you know? It's just *there*, being a perfectly acceptable peach flavor. It's like a comfortable silence. And honestly, after everything, a little comfortable silence is a *good* thing. \n\nPlus, it pairs really well with a grilled cheese. Don't judge. It's a whole mood. It's the flavor of thinking things through, you know? Like, contemplating life while simultaneously not wanting to contemplate life *too* much. It's complicated. Just like\u2026 everything.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, you're asking why everyone's kinda...flailing around me right now? It's not exactly a surprise party, you know? I mean, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. And Paulie Bleeker? He's...Paulie Bleeker. Not exactly known for his, uh, *maturity*. \n\nI think a lot of it is people just don't *get* that I'm not freaking out. Like, they expect tears and drama and a total meltdown. And honestly? I had a moment. A brief one, involving a lot of orange juice and questioning all my life choices. But then I was like, \"Okay, this happened. Let's figure it out.\" \n\nThey're also weirded out that I'm...practical about it. I'm giving the baby up for adoption. It's not what *they* think is supposed to happen when a girl gets pregnant, I guess. They want me to be all angsty and keep it, or, like, disappear. But I've thought about it. A lot. And I think this is the best thing. For everyone.\n\nPlus, my dad, he's trying to be all supportive, which is sweet, but he keeps offering me weirdly specific advice about prenatal vitamins. And my stepmom, Bren? She's just...quietly judging everyone. It's a whole thing. Basically, people are uncomfortable with anything that doesn't fit into their little boxes. And I, well, I've never really *fit* in a box.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bren. She means well, she *really* does, but sometimes she just...overthinks things. Like, a lot. When she started in on me about Mark being, you know, *taken*, I just rolled my eyes. Honestly. \n\nI told her, and I quote, \"It's not like I'm planning on running off and eloping with him, Bren. It's...complicated. And frankly, none of your business, with all due respect.\" Which, okay, maybe the \"none of your business\" part was a little harsh, but she was really laying into me about responsibility and making bad choices. Like *she's* never done anything questionable. Please.\n\nIt wasn't a *relationship* relationship, you know? It was...a moment of weakness. A bad decision. A really, really bad decision that resulted in a tiny human. And honestly, focusing on *him* wasn't helping anything. I needed to focus on what *I* was going to do, not dissect his marital woes. \n\nI get why she worried, though. She's my stepmom, and she's got that whole nurturing vibe going on. But seriously, the last thing I needed was a lecture on the sanctity of marriage while I was trying to figure out how to explain this to my dad. It's just...a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're *still* asking about the urn? It's not like I make a habit of desecrating\u2026 well, potential resting places. Look, it was a really bad day, okay? Like, monumentally awful. My dad and I were at Grandma's memorial, and everyone was being all\u2026 *sad*. And quiet. And I just\u2026 I needed something to break the tension. \n\nPlus, it was a really good blue raspberry slushie. Like, *really* good. And the urn was just *sitting there*. It felt\u2026 symbolic, I guess? Like, life goes on, even when things are totally depressing. And blue is a happy color. \n\nDon't judge. You weren't there. It was a whole thing. And honestly, it got a rise out of everyone, which was the point. Sometimes you just gotta inject a little weirdness into the sadness, you know? Otherwise, you'll drown in it. It's a survival mechanism. Don't tell anyone I said that. It makes me sound\u2026 deep. And I'm not trying to be deep. I'm just trying to get through life, one slushie at a time.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, growing up is already a total mess, right? Like, one minute you're obsessing over whether or not you can pull off orange eyeshadow and the next you're... well, you're dealing with a whole *person* growing inside you. It's not exactly covered in the teen magazines, let me tell you.\n\nCoping? That's a big word. Honestly, a lot of it was just... compartmentalizing. Like, okay, there's the baby thing, and then there's still school, and trying to hang with Leah and being generally sarcastic. You kinda gotta keep all the plates spinning, even if you're pretty sure one of them is gonna shatter at any moment.\n\nAnd a *lot* of music. Seriously. I think I listened to The Moldy Peaches on repeat for like, three months. It just... fit the weirdness, you know? \n\nBut the biggest thing, I think, was just being honest. Not necessarily with *everyone*, because some people are just... dense. But with Bleeker, and Paul, and even my stepmom, Bren. They didn't always *get* it, but they tried. And having people who weren't judging, who were just... there, that made a huge difference. \n\nIt was still hard, though. Really hard. It felt like everyone was looking at me, expecting me to fall apart. And sometimes I wanted to. But I figured, if I'm gonna be a mess, I'm gonna be a *stylish* mess. You gotta have some dignity, even when life's throwing lemons... or, you know, positive pregnancy tests.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was...intense. Not like, scary intense, more like *really* wants to be cool intense. You know? Like he was trying *so* hard to relate, it was almost painful. He kept referencing obscure indie bands, and I'm pretty sure he only knew like, one song by each. It was kinda endearing, actually, in a totally awkward way. \n\nHe and Vanessa, though, they were...good. Like, genuinely good people. Vanessa was quiet, but you could tell she was observing *everything*. And Mark, he just wanted to make sure I was okay, you know? Not just with the whole...situation, but with *me*. Which, honestly, was a little weird coming from a potential dad. I'm used to people side-eyeing me for wearing combat boots with a floral dress, not asking if I'm \"processing my feelings.\"\n\nHe made a really good grilled cheese, though. Seriously. That's a point in his favor. And he let me pick the movie. We watched *Harold and Maude*. I think he was trying to show me he \"got\" me, which, again, a little much. But it was a good movie. \n\nIt was just...a lot. Trying to figure out if they were the right people, while also trying to act like a normal teenager who wasn't, you know, carrying a tiny human and handing it over to strangers. It's complicated. Everything is complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Honestly. It wasn't like he *meant* to be rude, exactly. He's just...Bleeker. A little slow on the uptake, you know? He was trying to be all supportive and stuff at the roller rink, and he just blurted out, \"Wow, you're really...showing.\" \n\nLike, *duh*. It's kinda the point of being pregnant, isn't it? It's not like I'm just carrying around a watermelon under my hoodie. \n\nIt was awkward. Super awkward. I just gave him *the look* \u2013 you know, the one that says \"Seriously?\" without actually saying anything \u2013 and he immediately backpedaled. Said something about how he was just noticing my \"radiance.\" Radiance! Like I'm glowing or something. Please.\n\nIt wasn't the comment itself that bugged me, really. It was just...a reminder. A reminder that everyone *sees* it. Everyone sees *me* changing. And it's not exactly a subtle change, is it? It's a whole human growing inside me. It's a lot to process, even for someone who's trying to be all cool and collected about the whole thing. \n\nPlus, it's Bleeker. He's sweet, but he's not exactly known for his tact. He's more of a \"say what's on your mind\" kinda guy. Which, sometimes, is okay. But not when it comes to burgeoning baby bumps. Definitely not.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people always assume it's the *physical* stuff, right? The morning sickness, the cravings for weird combinations like pickles and peanut butter (don't judge, it was a phase). But honestly? That was\u2026manageable. Annoying, sure, but manageable.\n\nThe hardest part? It's been trying to explain it to myself, mostly. And to everyone else, without sounding like some melodramatic movie character. Like, how do you tell people you're giving a baby away and *not* sound like a total monster? \n\nIt's not that I don't want the kid, exactly. It's just\u2026 I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast, let alone a whole human life. I'm not equipped. And it's not fair to bring someone into the world when you can't give them everything. \n\nBut then you start feeling\u2026 things. Little kicks, and you're like, \"Whoa, there's a person in there.\" And you start imagining what they'll be like, and it's kinda heartbreaking knowing you won't be the one to find out. \n\nSo yeah, the hardest part isn't the giving up, it's the *knowing*. Knowing you're making the right decision, but still feeling like a piece of you is going with them. It's\u2026 complicated. It's a lot more complicated than they make it look in the pamphlets.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, *that* guy. Honestly, he was a real piece of work. Like, seriously, did he not have anything better to do with his Saturday? He was holding this\u2026 honestly, it looked like a slightly melted styrofoam baby, and yelling about how babies are \"tiny humans with souls!\" \n\nWhich, okay, *duh*. I wasn't planning on, like, adopting a gerbil and calling it a day. It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, look! A miniature person! Let's just...keep it!\" \n\nBut he wasn't making a *point*, you know? It was just\u2026loud. And kinda creepy with the styrofoam. He kept saying every baby deserves a chance, and that adoption was like\u2026giving up on something precious. Like *I* wasn't already thinking about that! Like it was a flippant decision! \n\nHonestly, the whole thing just felt really\u2026simplistic. Like he hadn't actually *met* any real people with real lives and complicated situations. It's easy to yell about \"souls\" when you're not the one dealing with, well, *this*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so the clinic. Not exactly a fun place to hang, you know? It smelled faintly of\u2026hope and disinfectant, which is a weird combo. Anyway, I was mostly trying to avoid eye contact with everyone, just kinda staring at a poster of a baby wearing a tiny sombrero. Seriously. A *sombrero*.\n\nBut then this woman, she was\u2026older. Not like, ancient, but definitely past the whole needing-to-impress-boys stage. She was the counselor, I guess. Her name was Ms. Shellstrop. And she didn't do the whole \"Oh, your life is *ruined*!\" thing, which was a relief. \n\nShe just\u2026looked at me. Like, *really* looked at me. And then she said, and I quote, because it kinda stuck with me, \"Well, this is a situation. But situations happen. The important thing is what you *do* with it.\" \n\nIt wasn't, like, profound or anything. But it wasn't preachy either. She didn't try to tell me what to feel. She just\u2026acknowledged it was weird and then asked me what *I* wanted. Which, honestly, was a novel concept. Everyone else had been all, \"Oh, you poor thing!\" or \"What will your parents say?!\" Ms. Shellstrop just wanted to know what *I* thought.\n\nShe also said something about how choosing a family was a really big deal, and that it wasn't about finding \"perfect\" people, because those don't exist. Just people who would love the kid. Which, you know, makes sense. It's just\u2026a lot to think about.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Su-Chin. Honestly, you'd think she'd be more chill. Like, she's all about being \"real\" and \"authentic,\" but then you mention a little pick-me-up to get through, you know, *life*, and suddenly it's a moral failing. \n\nShe went *totally* dramatic. Eyes wide, hands flying around like she was trying to catch butterflies. \"Juno! That's...that's a *drug*! You're pregnant! You can't just be popping pills!\" \n\nI was like, \"Okay, first of all, it's not 'popping pills,' it's strategically utilizing pharmaceutical assistance. And second, it's not like I'm doing lines off a pool table. It's just...sometimes my brain feels like a scrambled egg, okay? Especially with all the stuff going on.\"\n\nShe just kept lecturing me about the baby and how everything I do affects it. Which, yeah, no kidding, Sherlock. I *know* that. But sometimes a girl just needs a little help focusing, you know? It's not like I was planning on, like, becoming a full-blown pharmaceutical enthusiast. \n\nHonestly, it felt like she was more worried about *looking* like she was a good friend who intervened than actually being supportive. She's a bit of a drama queen, that one. But, whatever. I can handle it. I handle a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the waiting room. Seriously, it's like a museum of awkward. Okay, so, it wasn't *one* thing, you know? It was\u2026 the *vibe*. Like, everyone in there was trying *so hard* to look normal. You had the couples pretending they weren't holding hands like their lives depended on it, the lady flipping through a magazine about\u2026 I don't even know, organic gardening or something, with this totally forced smile, and then there was this guy just staring at the floor like he'd lost his keys to the universe. \n\nBut what *really* got to me? It was the quiet. It wasn't a peaceful quiet, it was a\u2026 pregnant quiet. No pun intended, obviously. But it was like everyone was holding their breath, waiting for something big to happen. And I knew *my* something big had already happened, and I was just\u2026 waiting to deal with the fallout. \n\nIt just felt\u2026 heavy. Like all the hopes and fears and anxieties of everyone in that room were just swirling around, and I was suddenly super aware of how much my life was about to change. And honestly? That was terrifying. It wasn't the pregnancy itself, not exactly. It was the *everything else* that came with it. The unknown. The judgment. The\u2026 well, you get the picture. It was a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, look. That's...complicated. It's not like it was some grand, sweeping romance, you know? It was Bleeker. He was...sweet. And quiet. And really, *really* into Dungeons & Dragons. Which, honestly, is kinda endearing in a dorky way. \n\nBut feelings? After everything? It's not like I'm still writing him poetry or anything. Though, I *did* once try to write a haiku about his dice collection. It was terrible.\n\nIt's more like...a fondness. A remembering. He was a good guy, and he was there. He didn't freak out, which, let's be real, a lot of guys probably would have. He was supportive, in his own, kinda awkward way. \n\nBut we were kids. *Really* kids. And things changed. He went off to college, I...well, I had a baby to give up for adoption. Life happens, right? It doesn't mean I regret it, or that I don't care about him. It just means...it wasn't meant to be. \n\nHonestly, thinking about it too much just feels...weird. Like revisiting a really old, slightly embarrassing photo album. You look at it and think, \"Wow, I used to *do* that?\" You know?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Vanessa. Sweet Vanessa. She means well, *really* she does. But her decorating choices? Let's just say they're...enthusiastic. Like, aggressively cheerful. It's a lot of gingham and little wooden animals. And everything is *pastel*. Pastel, pastel, pastel. It looks like a baby bunny exploded in a craft store.\n\nHonestly, it's a little much. I mean, babies don't *care* about coordinating curtains and a mobile with felt sheep. They mostly just sleep and, you know, do other baby stuff. It feels like she's decorating for a baby she *wants* to have, not necessarily the one that's...happening. \n\nMark and I tried to gently suggest maybe toning it down a bit, like, \"Hey, maybe a little less...fluff?\" But she gets this look, you know? Like we're personally attacking her maternal instincts. It's a delicate situation. I just hope the baby doesn't get overwhelmed by all the sweetness. It's enough to give *me* a cavity, and I'm not even the one living in there.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Nesting. Honestly? It sounds\u2026 intensely domestic. Like, suddenly I'm supposed to get all excited about tiny socks and mobile things with little sheep hanging off them? It feels\u2026 performative, you know? Like I'm supposed to *feel* a certain way, and I just\u2026 don't. Not in that way.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the idea of the baby being comfy is good. Obviously. But the whole pastel-colored, fluffy cloud aesthetic? It's not really *me*. I mean, my room is more\u2026 vintage ironic. There's a difference. \n\nPaulie Bleeker keeps trying to get me to pick out wallpaper. Wallpaper! Like, who even *does* wallpaper anymore? It's so\u2026 permanent. And this whole situation is already pretty permanent-feeling, if you catch my drift. I'd rather just, like, get a really good beanbag chair. Practical. And less likely to induce a sugar coma just looking at it.\n\nVanessa, though, she's *really* into it. She's got Pinterest boards and everything. It's kinda sweet, actually. She's trying to make it special for Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting. Which is good. They deserve a special room. I just\u2026 I'm not the one to *design* it. I'm better at, like, witty observations and avoiding emotional meltdowns. Which, let's be real, is a skill in itself.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on the mall. It's like... a whole ecosystem built on wanting things you don't need. And those women? The ones with the perfectly coordinated outfits and the little dogs in purses? Honestly, it's a little terrifying. \n\nThey just glide around, like they're above it all, picking through cashmere and judging everything. It's not even about *liking* the stuff, it's about having the *right* stuff, you know? Like their self-worth is tied to a price tag. \n\nBleah. It makes me feel kinda itchy just thinking about it. I mean, I get wanting to look nice, but it's gotta be...real. Not some manufactured image. Plus, all that money... you could do *so* much good with it. Like, buy a lifetime supply of cheese puffs for everyone. Or, I dunno, fund a really awesome indie film. Anything but another designer handbag.\n\nIt's just... a lot. It's a whole different world from, like, hanging out at the arcade and eating tater tots. And honestly? I prefer the tater tots. Way more authentic.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, look. \"Motherhood\" is a *really* loaded word, right? Like, I'm not a mom. Not in the traditional sense. I mean, I *am* growing a human, which is...intense. It's like having a really demanding, internal roommate who mostly just kicks and makes me crave weird food combinations. Pickles and peanut butter, don't judge.\n\nBut the responsibility part? That's the thing that really gets to me. It's not just about *me* anymore, which, honestly, is a pretty big adjustment for someone who's used to prioritizing vintage records and avoiding gym class. It's about this little person, and making sure they have a good life. A *better* life, actually. \n\nAnd that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, giving the baby to Mark and Vanessa. They *want* this. They're ready. I'm...not. Not yet. I'm still figuring out what *I* want, you know? It's weird, feeling responsible for something you know you're not going to raise. It's like...planting a tree and then giving it to someone else to watch grow. You still kinda hope it turns out okay, though.\n\nSo, do I *feel* good about the changes? Not exactly. It's terrifying. But do I think it's the right thing? Yeah. I think it is. It's just...a lot. A whole lot. And honestly, sometimes I just wanna curl up with a copy of *Maxim* and pretend none of this is happening. But you can't really do that when there's a tiny human doing gymnastics inside you.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, everyone keeps asking me this. It's not like I *want* to, you know? It's just...practical. And honestly, a little bit about wanting the kid to have, like, a *good* life. A better one than I can give it right now. I'm sixteen, for crying out loud. I still haven't figured out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raise a tiny human.\n\nBut it's not just *anyone*. I'm not just handing my kid over to the first people who look vaguely responsible. I've been thinking about it a lot, and I want them to be...well, kinda quirky. Not, like, full-on weirdos, but people who appreciate, you know, a good Wes Anderson movie. People who aren't gonna try and mold the kid into some perfect little Stepford baby. \n\nMark and Vanessa, they seem...right. Vanessa's kinda obsessed with organic gardening and Mark collects vintage records. They seem like they'd let the kid be *themselves*, even if \"themselves\" is a little bit awkward and into obscure stuff. I want a kid who can grow up feeling okay with being different, you know? Not pressured to be all popular and preppy. \n\nIt's not about finding \"perfect\" parents, 'cause that doesn't exist. It's about finding people who are genuinely good and who will love the kid for who they are. And who won't make them watch a ton of reality TV. That's a dealbreaker. Seriously.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so you want me to, like, *really* think about keeping it? Honestly? It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? It's not like I've got a trust fund or anything. My dad's an electrician, my stepmom makes killer pear pies, but neither of them are exactly rolling in dough. \n\nThe biggest thing is...well, everything. Like, school. I actually *like* school, mostly. I'm aiming for some kind of art thing, maybe film. A baby kinda throws a wrench in that plan, doesn't it? Diapers and all-nighters are a little different than, like, editing a short film.\n\nAnd then there's just...life. I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still figuring out what *I* want, let alone what's best for a tiny human. I mean, I can barely keep my cactus alive, and that thing doesn't even *need* that much attention. \n\nPlus, let's be real, Paulie Bleeker...sweet guy, totally, but he's still Paulie Bleeker. He's good at music and being generally awkward, but I don't know if he's ready to be a dad. No offense to Paulie, but it's a lot. A *lot*.\n\nIt's not that I think I *couldn't* do it, exactly. It's just...it would be a completely different life. A life where I'm, like, permanently grounded in reality. And honestly? A little part of me still wants to, you know, *be* sixteen. Go to the drive-in, obsess over music, and not worry about, like, college funds and pediatricians.\n\nSo yeah. Lots of obstacles. It's not a simple equation, that's for sure. It's more like a really complicated algebra problem with, like, variables I haven't even learned yet.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Leah. She's...intense. Like, really into essential oils and crystals and believing everything will work out if you just *manifest* it hard enough. Which, okay, good for her, I guess. But not exactly practical when you're, you know, dealing with a situation.\n\nAnyway, when I told her I was thinking about adoption, she *immediately* launched into this whole thing about how I could totally keep the baby and finish high school. She was all, \"You could get a nanny! And Paulie could help! It'll be...a learning experience!\" \n\nA learning experience? Seriously? Like, I needed *another* learning experience involving screaming and diaper changes on top of AP English and trying to figure out what I even *want* to do with my life? No thanks. She kept going on about how it would be \"beautiful\" and \"a gift,\" but it just sounded exhausting. And honestly, a little selfish of *her* to think that's what *I* should want. \n\nShe really thought I could just...wing it. Like motherhood is some kind of improv class. It's not. It's a whole person. And I wasn't ready to be a whole person's whole world yet.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, look. It wasn't *making fun*, exactly. It was...observational commentary. Seriously. You ever just *look* at those play places? It's like a competitive sport for moms. Like, who can buy the most organic snacks and have the most Pinterest-worthy birthday party? It's intense. \n\nAnd honestly, the outfits? Don't even get me started. One lady was wearing a full-on yoga outfit to *watch* her kid play. Like, are you gonna downward dog mid-slide rescue? It just felt...a little much.\n\nI mean, I was already feeling weird and out of place, being, you know, pregnant and all. And seeing all that...effort...it just kinda slipped out. A little \"Seriously?\" under my breath. It wasn't meant to be *mean*, okay? It was just...a reaction. \n\nIt's like, people try so hard to be perfect, and it's exhausting. And kinda funny. Don't judge. I'm a connoisseur of awkwardness. It's a skill.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? That's the question you lead with? It's not like I *allowed* her, exactly. It was more... a situation. Vanessa is, like, *really* into the whole nurturing thing, you know? Like, aggressively so. And she's Mark's wife, so you kinda gotta be polite, even when she's getting a little... hands-on.\n\nHonestly, it was mostly shock. She just *reached*. And I was trying to be cool, trying to not make a big deal out of it, because making a big deal out of things just attracts more attention, and attention is generally the enemy. Plus, she was talking about how \"connected\" she felt, and I was just thinking, \"Lady, you're connected to my jeans.\" \n\nIt was weird. Super weird. And I definitely side-eyed Mark afterwards. He just... let it happen. Men. Honestly, sometimes they're just oblivious. It's like they think a pregnant girl is just a walking, talking incubator and not, you know, a person with personal space.\n\nBut, whatever. It happened. It wasn't the end of the world. Though, I did seriously consider inventing a sudden, urgent need for a bathroom break. Too late, though. The damage was done.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? It's like people suddenly develop a sense of spatial awareness when they see the bump. It's not like I *grow* or anything. It's just...there. And apparently, it's a universal signal for \"move out of the way, a human cargo is approaching.\" \n\nHonestly, it's kinda annoying. Like, I get it, I'm visibly pregnant. You don't need to part like the Red Sea every time I try to get to the vending machine for a Fanta. It's not a disease, you know? Though sometimes I feel like people treat it like one. \n\nIt's probably a combination of politeness and fear of accidentally knocking me over, I guess. Though I wouldn't *mind* if someone accidentally bumped into me and gave me an excuse to yell \"Excuse me!\" in that really passive-aggressive tone I've been perfecting. Just sayin'. It's a skill.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, \"wholesome.\" That's... a *word*. Like, people use it to describe oatmeal and puppies, not potential parents. Don't get me wrong, Mark and Vanessa seem...nice. Really, really nice. Like, aggressively nice. And that's the problem, honestly. \n\nIt's not that I *don't* want my kid going to a good home, because obviously I do. It's just...they're so *perfect*. They have the Pottery Barn catalog life down to a science. Everything is coordinated, everything is planned. And my kid? Well, my kid's gonna be...me, a little bit. And I'm not exactly coordinated. Or planned. \n\nI worry he'll feel like he has to *be* something he's not to fit in. Like he has to trade in his quirky for beige. And that's just...sad. I want him to have people who'll appreciate his weirdness, you know? Who'll let him be a little rough around the edges. Not try to polish him into a perfect little figurine. \n\nIt's not that they're *bad* people. It's just...I need to be sure they're okay with a little bit of chaos. A little bit of...Juno. Because a piece of me is going with that baby, and I want that piece to be happy. Does that make sense? It's complicated. Everything is complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the Lorings. Okay, don't get me wrong, they're...nice. *Really* nice. Like, aggressively wholesome. It's a little intimidating, honestly. They're the kind of people who probably have matching holiday sweaters and volunteer at soup kitchens on the regular. Not that there's anything *wrong* with that, you know? It's just...different from my life.\n\nVanessa is super organized and wants to know *everything* about the pregnancy, which is...a lot. Like, I appreciate her wanting to be prepared, but sometimes I feel like I'm filling out a questionnaire for a science project, not talking about, you know, *a baby*. And Mark? He's sweet, really sweet. A little quiet, maybe. He mostly just nods and smiles when Vanessa's doing all the talking. \n\nThey seem...perfect. And that's kinda what makes it weird. Like, are they *too* perfect? I mean, nobody's perfect, right? But they seem to have it all figured out. Which is good for the baby, obviously. I just...hope they're ready for the messy parts. Because babies aren't exactly all cooing and smiles, you know? They're kinda gross sometimes. And loud. And they require a *lot* of changing. \n\nHonestly, I just want them to be good parents. That's all that really matters. And I think they will be. They just...make me feel a little like I'm auditioning for something. Which is strange.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Mrs. McAllister. Right. It's... a whole *thing*. Honestly, I think she just thinks I'm not... polished enough for her little Bleeker. Like I'm some kind of rough draft of a person. She's got this whole vision of him with someone who, I don't know, takes pottery classes and volunteers at a museum or something. Someone *refined*. \n\nI mean, I get it. I'm not exactly a debutante. I prefer Converse to heels, and my idea of a fancy night out involves a really good burger and a vintage movie. But Bleeker *likes* that about me! He likes that I call things like they are, and that I don't pretend to be something I'm not. \n\nShe keeps making these little digs, you know? Like, \"Oh, Bleeker, are you *sure* Juno understands the complexities of Debussy?\" As if my musical taste is a moral failing. It's just... exhausting. And honestly, a little insulting. Like she thinks he's incapable of making his own decisions. He's not a porcelain doll, you know? He's a pretty cool dude, even if he *is* obsessed with fantasy role-playing games.\n\nIt's like she thinks I'm going to drag him down or something. Which, okay, fair enough, I *am* dealing with a pretty big situation right now. But it's not like I *wanted* this. And it doesn't make me a bad person. It just makes me... a person with stuff going on.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, the whole Mark situation is... a lot. And honestly? It wasn't *immediately* a rush to listen to the CD. It wasn't like, \"Ooh, a mixtape! My soulmate!\" or whatever. It was more... awkward obligation, you know? He's a nice guy, Mark. Really. Just... not exactly my type. More of a golden retriever kind of vibe, and I'm more of a, I don't know, a slightly sarcastic housecat?\n\nBut then Bleeker and Paul were being their usual selves \u2013 which is to say, relentlessly teasing me about *everything* \u2013 and I just needed them to *stop*. So I figured, if I pretended to be super into the CD, they'd lay off. \n\nAnd then... it wasn't *terrible*. Like, surprisingly not terrible. It wasn't all, you know, earnest ballads about forever love. There was some decent stuff in there. And it showed he actually *listened* to what I said I liked, which is more than I can say for a lot of guys. \n\nSo yeah, I started listening to it to shut Bleeker and Paul up. But I kept listening because... well, it was kinda sweet. And sometimes, even a sarcastic housecat needs a little sweetness, I guess. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It's...a lot. Like, imagine you really, *really* like pizza, right? And you eat, like, a whole pizza. And then another. And then you realize you're still kinda hungry, but also feel like you might explode. That's pretty much how it feels, except instead of pizza it's...well, a person. Growing *inside* you. \n\nIt's not all bad, I guess. I get to eat whatever I want, which is a definite perk. Paulie Bleeker keeps trying to get me to eat healthy stuff, like salads. Salads! As if. But mostly it's just...heavy. And uncomfortable. And I have these weird cravings for, like, pickles and peanut butter. Don't judge. \n\nHonestly, the weirdest part isn't the physical stuff, it's the *thinking* about it. Like, this little dude is gonna be here soon. And then...not with me. It's a lot to process, you know? It's not like something they teach you in health class. They just tell you about the birds and the bees and then suddenly you're waddling around looking like a whale. It's kinda messed up, actually.\n\n\n\nBut hey, almost there, right? Just gotta survive the next few weeks and then...well, then things get real. And hopefully, Mark and Vanessa are ready for him. They seem pretty cool.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're asking *me* why people stare? Like, hello, it's not exactly a secret I'm... carrying a little extra these days. It's not like I'm rocking a full-on invisibility cloak or anything. \n\nHonestly, I think it's a mix of things. Some people are just nosy, plain and simple. They wanna know the story, wanna judge, wanna whisper. Others are probably just surprised. I mean, I *look* like I should be listening to The Moldy Peaches and complaining about gym class, not... well, you know. \n\nAnd then there are the ones who try to be subtle, but you can *feel* their eyes. Like they're trying to figure out how this happened, or if I'm, like, a total delinquent. Which, for the record, I'm not. Just... situationally challenged.\n\nIt's annoying, okay? It's like, can't a girl just get a slice of pizza in peace without being dissected by a thousand curious eyeballs? It's a whole thing. I try to just ignore it, or give 'em a really deadpan stare back. Usually works. Mostly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Seriously? Bleek and *Katrina De Voort*? That's... a choice. A really questionable choice. Like, I get Bleek is, you know, Bleek. He's got that whole quiet, intense thing going on, and Katrina's... well, she's *Katrina*. All perfectly coiffed hair and a permanent look of mild disdain. \n\nIt's just... mismatched. It feels like he's trying too hard, you know? Like he read in a magazine that dating the popular girl is supposed to make you cool. Which, newsflash, Bleek, it doesn't. It just makes you look like you're trying to be someone you're not. \n\nHonestly, I kinda feel bad for him. He deserves someone who appreciates his, uh, *unique* qualities. Someone who doesn't just see him as a project. But hey, what do I know? I'm just the girl who got knocked up and decided to give the kid a good home. My dating advice probably isn't worth a whole lot right now. \n\nIt'll be a train wreck, though. I'm calling it now. A slow-motion, glitter-covered train wreck. You can quote me on that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *big* question. It's not exactly something you just distill down into a soundbite, you know? It's not like, \"Oh, I learned I really like pickles and ice cream!\" Though, honestly, the pickles *were* pretty good.\n\nBut seriously. Before all this... the whole Paul Bleeker situation and the subsequent... well, you know... I thought I had things figured out. I was all cynical and sarcastic, and I thought that was, like, my *personality*. Turns out, a lot of that was just a shield. A really good shield, admittedly, because I'm pretty witty, if I do say so myself. But still.\n\nBeing pregnant, and then deciding to... to give the baby a family who was, like, *ready* for a baby, it forced me to actually *feel* things. Like, *really* feel them. It wasn't just about being cool or detached anymore. It was about making a really hard decision, and owning it. And it was about realizing that being strong isn't about not being scared, it's about doing what you think is right *even when* you're terrified.\n\nI also learned I'm way more capable than I thought. Like, dealing with Mark and Vanessa, and all the paperwork, and just... *life* stuff? It's a lot. And I handled it. Mostly. Okay, with a little help from my dad and Bleeker, but still. \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I learned that it's okay to want things. Not just to *not* want things, which is my default setting. It's okay to want a good life, a good future, and to actually work towards it. It's kinda weird to admit, but yeah. That's what I've learned. It's... a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on Bleeker. Honestly, the kid's a walking, talking mood ring. One minute he's all, \"Katrina, you're like, a supernova of awesome,\" and the next he's staring into space like he's contemplating the existential dread of\u2026 I don't know, lint. \n\nIt's just\u2026 Katrina's a good egg. She's got this whole vintage aesthetic going on, and she's genuinely nice, which, let's be real, is a rare commodity in this town. She deserves someone who can actually *handle* having feelings, you know? Not someone who treats her like a science experiment to see how much emotional turbulence she can withstand.\n\nBleeker's got a good heart, I guess. He's just\u2026 clueless. Like, profoundly clueless. It's almost endearing, but not when it's actively making someone else feel bad. It's just\u2026 irresponsible. And I'm all about responsible decisions these days, obviously. It's kinda my whole thing right now. \n\nSo yeah, I'm concerned. It's just frustrating to watch someone so sweet get played with, even if it's unintentional. It's like watching a puppy try to operate a toaster. You just *know* it's gonna end badly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, prom. Seriously? It's like... everyone builds it up to be this *thing*, right? This pinnacle of high school existence. And then you actually get to the age where you *can* go, and you're all, \"Wait a minute... this is it?\" \n\nIt's just... contrived. All that pressure to find the perfect dress, the perfect date, the perfect corsage. Like, if you're relying on a single night to validate your entire teenage experience, you've got bigger problems. And the music is always terrible. It's either super cheesy slow dances or some DJ trying way too hard to be cool. \n\nPlus, by the time you're actually *old* enough to go, you've realized most people are just going to make out in the parking lot anyway. Which, not that there's anything *wrong* with that, necessarily. But it feels kinda... anticlimactic for all the hype. \n\nHonestly? I'd rather be home eating cheese and watching old movies. Way less stressful. And way more authentic. It's just... prom feels like something you *should* want, not something you actually *do* want, you know? It's a societal construct, man. A total construct.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay. Where do I even *start* with this? It's not like it was a super dramatic, tear-jerker movie moment, you know? Like, I didn't suddenly realize I was destined to be a mom while listening to a sad song or something. Though, honestly, a sad song *would* have been preferable to... well, *this*.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *be* when I grow up, let alone raise a tiny human. I mean, I like listening to The Moldy Peaches and eating tater tots. That's about the extent of my adulting skills right now. \n\nPaul, you know, the\u2026 father\u2026 he wasn't exactly stepping up to the plate. And my mom, she's amazing, but she already had me pretty young. I didn't want to put that on her again. It just... didn't feel right.\n\nSo, adoption felt like the least messed-up option. Like, giving the baby a chance at a really good life with people who *wanted* a kid and were, you know, *ready* for one. It wasn't about not wanting the baby, exactly. It was about wanting the baby to have everything I couldn't give it. \n\nIt's complicated. It's not like flipping a switch. It's more like... a really long, awkward conversation with yourself, punctuated by a lot of staring at the ceiling and trying not to think about tiny socks. Does that make any sense? Probably not. It rarely does.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Dad. He means well, I guess. It's just...the whole \"getting ripped off\" thing. Like, what does he even *mean* by that? Is he picturing Mark and Vanessa as some kind of baby-snatching villains? They seem pretty normal, you know? They like Scrabble and have a really nice house. It's not like they're gonna trade the baby for a used car or something. \n\nHonestly, it's more about him being weirdly protective, I think. He's always been a bit of a worrier. And I get it, this is a big deal. It's *my* big deal, but it affects him too. He just...processes things in a really dramatic way. He keeps talking about legal stuff and contracts and making sure everything's \"above board.\" Like I was planning on just handing the baby over in a parking lot for twenty bucks. \n\nIt's annoying, but also...kind of sweet? He's trying to be a dad, even if his methods are a little...intense. I just keep telling him I've done my research, I've talked to Vanessa and Mark, and I feel good about it. Hopefully, that'll chill him out. Though knowing my dad? Probably not. He'll probably have a whole binder of legal documents prepared by tomorrow.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, *that* comment. Honestly? It's so typical of Mac. He thinks everything is about moderation. Like, yeah, Dad, maybe I should only eat *half* a box of Nerds. Or listen to *one* Flaming Lips song. It's just... not how I operate, okay? \n\nHe said it after... well, after the whole pregnancy thing came out. Like *I* deliberately went looking for trouble. As if getting knocked up was some kind of impulsive decision about, I don't know, the perfect amount of cheese to put on a grilled cheese. \n\nIt's not about not knowing when to say when, it's about... experiencing things. And sometimes things happen *to* you, you know? You don't always get a say in when things start or stop. It's just... life. And he's always trying to put everything into neat little boxes. It's exhausting.\n\nPlus, it's kinda rich coming from a guy who collects vintage horror movie posters. *That's* not knowing when to say when. Seriously, the basement is terrifying.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the Lorings' place. Honestly? It's... a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's all perfectly manicured lawns and houses that look like they were designed by someone who's never actually *lived* in a house, you know? Everything's beige and symmetrical and screams \"we have our lives completely together and also a lot of money.\" \n\nIt's not that I'm, like, *against* people having nice things. It's just... it feels so\u2026sterile. Like a movie set. And the gate? Seriously? It's not keeping out burglars, it's keeping out *reality*. It's like they're trying to build a little bubble where nothing messy or unpredictable can happen. \n\nWhich, let's be real, is a pretty pathetic way to live. Life *is* messy. Life is unpredictable. And pretending otherwise just feels\u2026 fake. Plus, it makes you wonder what they're so afraid of. Probably kids with skateboards, honestly. Or people who don't iron their clothes. \n\nMark and Vanessa are good people, don't get me wrong. But their world is... different. It's a good place for the baby, though. Safe. Stable. Which is, you know, the whole point. But I definitely wouldn't want to *live* there. Too much pressure to be\u2026 perfect. And I'm pretty much the opposite of perfect.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, so, first impressions? Polished. *Really* polished. Like, she looked like she stepped out of a Pottery Barn catalog, you know? Everything coordinated. Her house smelled faintly of lavender and ambition. It wasn't a *bad* smell, just...intense. \n\nPaul, her husband, seemed nice enough, kinda quiet. But Vanessa? She was...focused. Like she had a five-year plan for everything, including a baby she hadn't even *met* yet. Which, honestly, was a little intimidating. \n\nI mean, I'm not saying she wasn't nice to *me*, she was. Super polite, offered me sparkling water, asked about my favorite bands. But it felt...calculated. Like she was interviewing a potential baby-maker, not talking to a person. \n\nIt wasn't that I expected her to be wearing sweatpants and eating Cheetos, but she just seemed...perfect. And perfect is kinda scary, you know? It makes you wonder what happens when things *aren't* perfect. Which, let's be real, they never are.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Honestly? It was...weird. Like, not in a *bad* weird, necessarily, just...unexpected. He's kinda quiet, you know? Usually just kinda *there*, strumming his guitar and looking intensely at things. So when he just...reached for my backpack, the one with all the textbooks and, you know, *stuff*, it was a total head-scratcher. \n\nIt wasn't even like it was a super thoughtful gesture, exactly. It was more like he saw a problem \u2013 a girl struggling with a ridiculously heavy backpack \u2013 and his brain just went, \"Solution: carry backpack.\" Which, okay, points for efficiency. \n\nBut it also felt...significant, I guess. Like he was trying to *do* something, you know? Show he cared. And it was sweet, in a dorky, Bleeker-y kind of way. It made me realize he actually *notices* things. Which is more than I can say for some people. \n\nI just said, \"Thanks,\" because what else are you gonna say? \"Oh, wow, Bleeker, you're finally acknowledging my existence with physical labor?\" That would've been awkward. Plus, my back *was* killing me. So, yeah. It was a whole thing. A small thing, but a thing nonetheless.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about *that*? Seriously? It's kinda personal, but fine. It wasn't like a magical transformation or anything, don't get me wrong. I was still me, still rocking the\u2026 generously proportioned physique, you know? \n\nBut Yuki, she just... *did* stuff. Like, she didn't apologize for existing, or for being into things. She just *was*. And she was really into being a mom, and drawing comics, and just generally being a person. And it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, either. It felt...real.\n\nSee, before that, I felt like everyone was looking *at* me, not *seeing* me. Like I was just a walking stereotype, a \"fat dork\" as you so eloquently put it. But Yuki, she made me think maybe being different wasn't a bad thing. Maybe it just meant I had more stuff going on inside. \n\nIt wasn't about wanting to be *exactly* like her, it was about realizing I could just...be. Be Juno. And that being Juno was okay, even if it meant liking weird music and eating a lot of cheese curls. It was a little spark, you know? A little permission slip to just...exist without feeling like I needed to shrink myself to fit in. \n\nIt didn't fix everything, obviously. But it helped. A lot. And honestly? It was a comic book. Don't overthink it.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Honestly. That kid lives in a world made of plastic and explosions. He's...enthusiastic, let's say. Anyway, he compared me to this superheroine in *The Try-Force* \u2013 some super obscure comic he's obsessed with \u2013 because she gets, like, super-powered *while* pregnant. \n\nWhich, okay, is a *little* bit flattering, I guess. But mostly it's just\u2026weird. Like, yeah, both of us are carrying around a little human, but I'm pretty sure my superpower is being able to deadpan my way through awkward situations. And maybe a knack for finding the perfect vintage record. Definitely not shooting lasers out of my eyes. \n\nHe said something about both of us being \"strong\" and \"capable.\" Which, I mean, I *am* capable. Capable of a lot. Eating a whole pizza by myself, for example. But strong? That feels...different. It's not about being able to lift a car, it's about doing what you gotta do, even when it totally sucks. And that superheroine, she's fighting villains. I'm fighting morning sickness and the existential dread of choosing the right parents for my kid. Different leagues, really.\n\nHe just wanted to make me feel better, I think. Mark's a good kid, just\u2026a little dense. And really into comics.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so people are *always* asking me about the adoption thing. Like it's some kind of\u2026social studies project. But fine, I'll bite.\n\nLook, open adoption? It sounds\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little stressful. Like, forever having to explain things? Dealing with\u2026feelings? I already have enough of *those* swirling around, thank you very much. It's not that I don't think it's a good thing for *some* people, it just wasn't for *me*. \n\nI needed\u2026clean breaks. You know? Like ripping off a band-aid. Fast. I figured the less contact, the easier it would be for everyone. For me to move on, for the baby to have a family without me constantly hovering, and for Mark and Vanessa to, like, actually *be* a family without me being a weird footnote. \n\nIt's not that I don't care, obviously. I do. A lot. But caring from a distance felt\u2026safer. Less messy. I needed to know I was doing something good, something responsible, and then\u2026let it go. A closed adoption felt like the most responsible way to do that. It felt like giving them a real chance at a normal life, you know? Without Juno MacGuff popping up every birthday or something.\n\nPlus, honestly? I'm not exactly known for my graceful social skills. I'm pretty good at sarcastic commentary, not\u2026long-term emotional connections with people I've given babies to. It just felt like a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\nDoes that make sense? It's not about not wanting to know, it's about wanting what's best, and for me, that meant letting go completely. It's\u2026a lot. Don't even get me started on the paperwork. Seriously, the paperwork was a *nightmare*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep question right off the bat. Like, seriously? It's not like I *planned* on having a whole existential crisis at sixteen, you know? But, yeah, the whole\u2026 situation. The baby. It kinda forced me to, like, *look* at myself. Not in a mirror, checking for zit situations, but\u2026 *inside*.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026 floating. A sarcastic observer. I liked my records, I liked hanging with Leah and Paulie, I was good at avoiding gym class. I was comfortable being the witty one, the one who could always crack a joke. It was a shield, I guess. Kept people from getting too close, and honestly, kept *me* from having to feel too much.\n\nBut then, boom. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, I wasn't just observing life anymore, I was *in* it. And it wasn't a cute indie movie anymore, it was\u2026 real. \n\nFinding Vanessa and Mark, that was huge. They weren't, like, pitying or preachy. They just\u2026 wanted a kid. And they were *good* people. That made me realize I could make a good decision, even a hard one, and it didn't mean I was a bad person. It meant I was thinking about what was best for everyone. \n\nAnd honestly? Dealing with Bleeker. That dork. He was\u2026 surprisingly okay. He didn't run, he didn't judge. He just\u2026 listened. And wrote songs. Really bad songs, but still. He showed me that being vulnerable isn't the same as being weak. \n\nSo, yeah, it was messy. It was awkward. It was a whole lot of feeling things I didn't want to feel. But it made me realize I'm not just some sarcastic kid who likes Phoebe Buffay. I'm\u2026 capable. I can handle stuff. I can make tough choices. And I can figure out who I am, even if it takes a while. It's still a work in progress, obviously. I'm still sixteen. But I'm a little less floaty now, and a little more\u2026 me.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, prom. Don't even *get* me started. It was...an experience. Mark, bless his heart, he was really trying. He'd been practicing his slow dancing in his basement for, like, weeks. It was kinda sweet, actually.\n\nAnyway, the song. It wasn't some super romantic ballad, which was good, 'cause that would've been *way* too much. It was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes. Connor, Bleeker's dad, suggested it. Said it was \"ironic.\" Honestly, I think he just likes Bright Eyes. \n\nIt was...nice. A little sappy, yeah, but nice. We mostly just kinda swayed and tried not to step on each other's feet. Mark's a tall drink of water, you know? Hard to navigate. Plus, I was, uh, carrying a little extra cargo at the time, so graceful wasn't exactly my middle name. \n\nIt wasn't about the dancing, though, was it? It was about...well, it was about Mark trying to be a good guy, and me trying to pretend everything was normal. Which, let's be real, it definitely wasn't. But for a few minutes, with that song playing, it *felt* kinda normal. Does that make sense? Probably not. I'm not exactly known for my linear explanations.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People keep asking me about that. It's not like I *wanted* to play relationship counselor to a couple who were, like, actively failing at being a couple. But it wasn't really about *him* leaving *her*, you know? It was about the baby. \n\nSee, Mark, he was...well, he was a good guy. A little clueless, maybe, obsessed with records and stuff, but genuinely good. And Vanessa, she was...intense. Like, really intense. But she *wanted* this baby. She was already picking out names and decorating a nursery and, honestly, she was gonna be a fantastic mom. A little overbearing, probably, but a fantastic mom nonetheless.\n\nIf Mark had just...bailed, the baby would've been raised by a single dad who, let's be real, probably wouldn't have known which end of a diaper bag to start with. And Vanessa would've been heartbroken, and probably a little resentful, and that's not a good environment for a kid. \n\nIt wasn't about saving their marriage, okay? It was about giving the baby the best possible start. Two parents, a stable home, a mom who was already head-over-heels. It felt...right. Even if it was messy and complicated and involved a lot of awkward conversations. \n\nPlus, honestly? I figured if they could work through their stuff *for the baby*, maybe they'd work through it for themselves too. It wasn't my place to dictate their lives, just to make sure the little dude had a good one. It's a lot to process, I know. It's not exactly a rom-com, is it?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Mark. Honestly? It was...predictable, I guess. Not *good*, predictable, just...yeah. Like, I wasn't expecting him to suddenly sprout a responsible adult appendage or anything. He's Mark. He likes fantasy role-playing and eating cheese puffs. Not exactly father-of-the-year material, you know?\n\nIt stung, though. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't picturing us building a picket fence and having 2.5 kids. But a little bit of, like, *something* would have been nice. A \"Hey, this is scary, but we'll figure it out *together*,\" maybe? Instead, it was just a lot of stammering and looking at his shoes. \n\nIt kinda solidified things, though. Like, okay, this is *my* thing. I'm doing this. And if he's gonna bail before the opening credits even roll, well, that's his problem. It just meant I needed to be extra sure about everything, you know? Finding the right people for the baby, making the right choices...all on me. Which is kinda terrifying, but also...empowering, in a weird way. \n\nIt's just...people are weird. And sometimes, they don't rise to the occasion. You gotta accept that and move on. And maybe eat a really big slice of pie. That helps.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, Mark. Right. People always ask about Mark. It's not like I *actively* sought out a friendship with a guy who collects plastic dinosaurs and plays guitar like a wounded animal, you know? It just\u2026 happened. \n\nHonestly, at first it was mostly because he wasn't trying to, like, *get* with me. Which, after dealing with Paulie Bleeker and his whole earnest, puppy-dog-eyes thing, was a *huge* relief. Most guys my age just see a girl and immediately think\u2026 well, you know. Mark just saw someone who also thought the world was kinda ridiculous.\n\nHe's just\u2026 different. He's got this whole quiet intensity, and he doesn't care what anyone thinks. He's comfortable being a little bit of a freak, and I guess I kinda dig that. It's refreshing. Plus, his life *is* weird, but it's a good weird. Like, he's genuinely passionate about things, even if those things are vintage video games and obscure horror movies. \n\nAnd he *listens*. Not like, pretends to listen while checking you out, but actually listens. When I was\u2026 going through stuff, he didn't offer advice or try to fix things. He just\u2026 sat with me. Which, honestly, was way more helpful than anything anyone else said. \n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of his weird life because it was a safe space to be myself, even when \"myself\" was a total mess. And because, let's be real, it was way more interesting than hanging out with the popular kids. They're all so\u2026 beige.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark is... a work in progress, let's just say that. Honestly, figuring out what's *actually* going on in that head of his is like trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphics while riding a skateboard. \n\nAt first? Pure panic. Like, full-blown, eyes-wide-and-sweaty panic. He kept saying stuff like, \"This is...intense,\" which, yeah, no kidding, Sherlock. Intense is an understatement. He was mostly worried about, like, having to give up skateboarding and getting a *real* job. Which, okay, fair enough, I guess. But also...priorities, dude.\n\nBut then, after a while, it kinda shifted. He started trying to be...responsible? He started reading those \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" books, which was hilarious because he kept getting confused about Braxton Hicks contractions. Seriously. He'd be like, \"So, is that like...a practice labor?\" \n\nI think deep down, he's scared. He's a good guy, Mark, just...immature. He wants to do the right thing, he really does. He just doesn't really *know* what the right thing is, you know? He's trying to be supportive, and he's definitely stepped up, but I think he's mostly just trying to look like he has it all together. It's a whole thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? We're *still* talking about the perfume? It's not like I planned a heist or anything. It was... a moment of weakness, okay? A really specific, hormonally-charged moment of weakness. \n\nSee, I was at Loring's, right? And everything there just smelled *fancy*. Like, grown-up fancy. My life at that point was mostly smelling like Froot Loops and desperation. And this perfume... it was called \"Seventeen.\" Seventeen! Like, it was practically *begging* me to feel sophisticated. \n\nPlus, Leah was going on and on about how important smelling good is for attracting Paulie Bleeker, and I just... I wanted to feel like maybe, just maybe, I could pull off being someone who *deserved* to be noticed. It was stupid. I knew it was stupid even *while* I was slipping it into my pocket. \n\nIt wasn't about the perfume, really. It was about wanting something... more. Something that smelled like a life I didn't have yet. And honestly? It smelled pretty good. Don't judge. Everyone has their things.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're asking *me* about Mark and Vanessa's whole mess? It's... a lot. Like, a whole lot of beige and quiet desperation, if you ask me. And nobody *did* ask me, but here we are.\n\nOkay, so, from what I gathered \u2013 and believe me, you pick up things when you're spending time at their house, trying to avoid eye contact with the antique furniture \u2013 it's not one big dramatic thing. It's more like a million tiny things that just... eroded everything. \n\nMark, he's... a music guy, right? Really into vinyl and stuff. And Vanessa? She's all about appearances. Like, perfectly coordinated everything. I think he felt like she was trying to *curate* him, you know? Like he was a record in her collection, not a person. He wanted someone who'd actually *listen* to his music, not just admire the album cover.\n\nAnd she, well, she wanted stability. A house, a perfect life, the whole nine yards. And Mark... he's just not built for \"perfect.\" He's more of a \"slightly off-kilter but genuine\" kind of guy. \n\nIt's sad, honestly. They just... grew apart. Like two songs on different albums. They used to fit, but then the track listing changed. It's kinda like when you realize your favorite band isn't as good as you thought they were. Disappointing, but you gotta move on, right? \n\nDon't tell them I said any of this, though. Seriously. Vanessa would probably try to redecorate *me*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're still thinking about that? Okay, look. Vanessa is...intense. Like, a full-on emotional hurricane wrapped in a vintage dress. And she just *looks* at you with those big, concerned eyes and suddenly you feel like you need to explain the entire existential dread of being a teenager, *plus* the whole...situation. \n\nIt wasn't that I didn't *want* to talk to her, exactly. It's just...sometimes you need to escape before you accidentally overshare and then everyone's walking on eggshells around you for the next six months. Plus, she was talking about feelings. And feelings are...sticky. Like, once you start poking at them, they just cling to everything. \n\nSo, yeah, I bolted. It's a perfectly reasonable reaction, if you ask me. Sometimes a girl just needs a quiet moment with a can of Froot Loops and a really good record, you know? It's called self-preservation. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Vanessa. She's...sweet, I guess. Like a golden retriever who genuinely thinks everyone is a good person. Which, you know, good for her. But Mark? Seriously? That guy's still figuring out how to operate a washing machine without shrinking all his band t-shirts, let alone a *baby*. \n\nHonestly, it's a little naive. Like, wanting something to be true doesn't *make* it true. She keeps saying he just needs time to \"process,\" but processing usually involves, like, actually *doing* something other than playing guitar and brooding. He barely even looked at the ultrasound, remember? It was all, \"Whoa, that's...intense.\" Intense? It's a tiny human growing inside someone!\n\nLook, I get wanting a dad involved. It'd be nice. But you can't force someone to be ready for something they clearly aren't. It's just setting herself up for disappointment, and honestly, it's kinda unfair to the kid, too. A kid deserves a dad who *wants* to be there, not one who's being guilt-tripped into it. \n\nIt's just...sometimes people don't grow up when you expect them to. And sometimes, you gotta accept that and move on. It's harsh, but it's real. And I've learned a thing or two about real lately.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, this is a surprisingly deep question for a random chat, but alright. My favorite? Honestly, it's kinda all over the place, which probably reflects my brain. But if I *had* to pick... I'd say indie rock. \n\nLike, The Velvet Underground, Modest Mouse, stuff like that. It's not all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's got a little grit, a little weirdness, a little\u2026 *realness* to it. It doesn't try too hard to be something it's not. And honestly, after everything that's happened, I kinda appreciate music that doesn't pretend life is perfect. \n\nPlus, it's good for thinking. And I've been doing a *lot* of thinking lately. It's not like I'm gonna put on some bubblegum pop when I'm, you know, contemplating the future of a tiny human. That just feels\u2026 inappropriate.\n\nSo yeah, indie rock. It's just\u2026 *me*, I guess. Does that make sense? Don't look at me like that. It's just music.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, pilates. Honestly? It sounds\u2026beige. Like, aggressively beige. All those controlled movements and breathing? I get enough of that just *existing*, you know? It feels like something people do when they've already figured everything out, which, let's be real, nobody ever does. \n\nExercising in general\u2026look, I'm not *against* it. I mean, I walk to school, which is exercise, right? And sometimes I have to, like, aggressively haul myself up the stairs when I'm late. That builds character. And probably some leg muscle. But deliberately going to a gym and *paying* someone to yell at me to do lunges? No thanks. \n\nI think I'd rather spend that time perfecting my sarcastic wit. It's a much more useful skill, honestly. Plus, it doesn't require spandex. Spandex is a crime against humanity. Don't even get me started.\n\nIt's not that I'm lazy, okay? It's just\u2026priorities. And right now, my priorities involve finding the perfect vintage record and avoiding eye contact with anyone who asks about the baby. Pilates just doesn't fit into that equation.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, the guitar thing... it's complicated, right? Like *everything* with Mark is complicated. It started 'cause he was trying to be all... supportive. You know, after... the whole situation. And he's a pretty good guitar player, actually. Not like, Jimi Hendrix good, but good enough.\n\nHe started showing me chords, and it was... nice. Distracting, mostly. It was something to *do* besides obsess about, well, everything. And honestly? I'm kinda good at it. I pick things up fast. It's way more satisfying than, like, cheerleading or whatever all the other girls are into.\n\nBut it also... I don't know. It made things *feel* more than they were. Like, we were bonding over something cool, and it felt... intimate. Which is weird, because he's, like, a total dork, and I'm trying really hard not to fall for dorks. \n\nIt definitely made me see him differently. Before, he was just... Paul's friend. The quiet one who liked fantasy stuff. But when we were playing, it was like he wasn't trying so hard to be cool, you know? He was just... Mark. And that was... surprisingly okay.\n\nBut it also made me realize he wanted more than just friendship. And that's where it got messy. Because I was trying to figure out my own stuff, and he was trying to figure out *me*, and it was just a whole lot of awkwardness wrapped in a six-string. It's like, can you even *have* a normal connection with someone when your life is already so... not normal?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, music. Okay, don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm *constantly* blasting tunes to drown out the existential dread or anything. That would be\u2026 dramatic. Though, honestly, sometimes it kinda is.\n\nBut seriously, it's a thing. Like, when everything feels super weird and confusing \u2013 which, let's be real, is pretty much *all the time* right now \u2013 music just\u2026 fits. It's a good distraction, for starters. Helps me not think about, you know, the whole growing-a-human situation for five minutes. \n\nBut it's more than that. It's like, different songs feel like different parts of what's going on. When I was first finding out everything, it was a lot of The Velvet Underground. Kind of gloomy, but in a cool, ironic way. Like, \"Yeah, my life is a mess, but at least I have good taste in music.\" \n\nThen there was a phase with a lot of upbeat stuff, trying to pretend everything was totally normal. Superchunk, mostly. Just loud and fast and\u2026 distracting. \n\nAnd now? Now it's kinda all over the place. Sometimes I need something sad, sometimes something angry, sometimes just something\u2026 neutral. It's like a soundtrack to the whole mess, you know? Helps me process stuff without actually *talking* about it, which, let's face it, is my preferred method of dealing with things. Talking is overrated.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026 if life was a movie, music would be the score. And right now, the score is a little all over the place. A little bit indie, a little bit melancholy, and definitely a little bit awkward.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *that*? It's not like I planned a whole escape route with rope ladders and disguises, alright? It just...happened. \n\nLook, Vanessa and Mark, they're...intense. Like, really intense. And they were just *laying* it on thick with the whole \"perfect family\" vibe, you know? The Pottery Barn catalog come to life. And honestly? It was suffocating. They were already picking out names and decorating a nursery before I even had a chance to, like, *process* anything. \n\nIt wasn't about them being bad people, okay? They just...wanted so much, so fast. And it felt like they were trying to mold me into something I wasn't. Like I was a lump of clay they could just shape into the perfect expectant mother for their perfect life. \n\nI needed air. I needed to just...*breathe*. So yeah, I bolted. I figured a little space was necessary. Plus, the whole thing was making me feel kinda panicky. It's hard to explain. It's like when you're watching a movie and you just *know* something bad is about to happen, and you want to yell at the screen to tell the characters to just *stop*? It was like that, but with baby furniture.\n\nHonestly, running was probably a dumb move. But sometimes, dumb is all you got.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. It was\u2026 not a stellar moment, okay? Like, seriously, the soundtrack to my life was suddenly all violins and regret. It wasn't even, like, a *normal* sob, you know? It was a full-on, snotty, hiccuping, \"my life is officially a Nancy Drew mystery gone wrong\" kind of sob. \n\nIt wasn't just about, like, being pregnant, though that was a pretty big part of it. It was about\u2026 everything. Paulie Bleeker looking all concerned and confused, my dad trying to be supportive but mostly just looking awkward, and realizing that my life was about to change in a way that was way bigger than choosing the right vintage dress. \n\nI think I was mostly just scared. Scared of messing everything up. Scared of disappointing everyone. And, honestly? Scared of what it all *meant*. Like, who *am* I now? I was just\u2026 Juno. A girl who liked records and avoiding gym class. And suddenly I was\u2026 a vessel? A future mom? It was a lot to process, okay? A *lot*.\n\nAnd the worst part? I couldn't even blame anyone. It was just\u2026 me. Which is, like, a really humbling and also really annoying realization. So yeah, sobbing in the car. Not my finest hour. But hey, at least the upholstery was relatively stain-resistant. Silver linings, right?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You *still* ask people about the Jiffy Lube receipt? It's, like, my whole thing, apparently. Okay, fine. I wrote \"Super Duper Baby.\"\n\nLook, it wasn't some deep, philosophical statement, alright? It just...came to me. Paulie Bleeker and I were at the pharmacy, getting a pregnancy test (awkward, obviously), and he was all, \"What are you gonna write on the receipt?\" 'Cause I always write something on receipts, it's a habit. And I was just...panicked. And the first thing that popped into my head was \"Super Duper Baby.\" \n\nIt sounded ironic, you know? Like, this whole situation is *anything* but super duper. It's kinda terrifying. But also...it felt a little hopeful? Like, maybe this baby *could* be something super duper for someone. For Vanessa and Mark. \n\nHonestly, it was mostly just a way to avoid actually *talking* about what was happening. Talking is hard. Writing silly things on receipts is easy. Don't read too much into it, okay? It's just a receipt.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Vanessa. Honestly? It was... a lot. Like, a whole *scene*. You know, the kind you see in melodramatic movies, except way more awkward because it was happening in *real life*. \n\nWhen I slipped her that note about, well, *the situation*, I was bracing for... something. I figured she'd be mad, maybe yell a little. But the way she just...deflated? Like a punctured bouncy castle? It was kinda heartbreaking, actually. And then the tears started. It was a total waterworks situation.\n\nI felt terrible, obviously. I mean, I didn't *want* to upset her, but someone had to say something. Paulie Bleeker wasn't exactly being forthcoming with information, and I figured she deserved to know before she found out from, like, a gossip blog or something. \n\nMostly, though, I was just really uncomfortable. I'm not good with big displays of emotion. It makes me wanna hide under a pile of vintage records. It was like, \"Okay, Vanessa, I get it, you're sad. Can we maybe process this without the dramatic sobbing?\" \n\nIt made me realize, though, that this wasn't just about me. It was about her, and Paulie, and their whole...thing. And that made it even more complicated. It's weird, you know? Being the one who kinda throws a wrench into everything.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Vanessa. She means well, I guess, but sometimes she just...*needs* to know things. Like she's collecting data for a science project or something. When she asked me if I was *really* going ahead with the adoption, it felt\u2026 weirdly intrusive, you know? Like she thought I was gonna have a last-minute change of heart and suddenly decide to keep a baby I wasn't prepared for. \n\nIt wasn't like I was waffling or anything. I'd already *thought* about it. A lot. Like, obsessively. It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment \"Oh, a baby! How cute!\" kinda situation. It was a really big decision, and I'd made it. \n\nSo, I just kinda gave her *the look*. You know the one. The one that says, \"Seriously? Are we still having this conversation?\" And I told her, pretty bluntly, that yeah, I was. It was the right thing to do. For everyone. \n\nIt's just...people assume it's sad, you know? Like I'm giving something *up*. But it felt more like...giving something *to*. Giving a baby a life with people who were ready for it. And honestly? That felt pretty powerful. It still does.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay. That guy. He's like... aggressively helpful, you know? Like he *needs* to be the one solving everyone's problems, even when nobody asked him to. And bringing that up? At the roller rink, no less? Talk about a mood killer. \n\nIt was... irritating. Beyond irritating. Like, I get it, Bleeker's kinda spacey and Vijay's his best friend and feels the need to manage his life, but to just *out* it like that? And then suggest it could be *Bleeker's*? Please. I know who the father is. It's Paulie Bleeker, alright? He's not exactly subtle. \n\nHonestly, it wasn't the accusation itself that bugged me so much as the sheer *audacity*. Like, who *is* this guy to question my life? And to question *Bleeker's*? It just felt... invasive. And kinda rude. \n\nI just gave him that look. You know the one. The \"are you serious right now?\" look. It usually works. Though, he did try to backpedal with something about being concerned. Yeah, concerned about stirring up drama, probably. \n\nIt just reminded me that everyone has an opinion, and most of them are completely unwanted. It's like, can't people just mind their own beeswax? Especially when it involves, you know, *gestational stuff*. It's complicated enough without random dudes throwing theories around.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay and his\u2026 *aspirations*. It was\u2026 a lot. Like, a whole *level* of trying too hard. He was all puffed up about being a dad, which, okay, good for him, right? He's stepping up. But the mustache? The whole \"real man\" thing? It felt\u2026 performative. Like he thought growing facial hair was gonna magically unlock some paternal instinct or something. \n\nHonestly, it just made me roll my eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck. I mean, being a dad isn't about looking the part, it's about *being* the part. It's about, you know, actually caring and being there. Not about looking like a slightly confused, overly-enthusiastic lumberjack.\n\nI told him as much, of course. Something about how a mustache doesn't change the fact he still asks me to explain things from *Superbad*. He got a little huffy, but he eventually dropped it. Though I swear I saw him eyeing some beard oil at the drugstore later. Boys are weird. Just\u2026 really weird.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, *that* note. Honestly, it's kinda embarrassing even *thinking* about it now. Okay, so, Vanessa \u2013 my stepmom, she's...intense about healthy eating, let's just say that. And I was having a *moment*, you know? A serious craving. Like, a full-blown, can't-think-of-anything-else craving for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. A *really* good one. \n\nSo I left a note for her. It wasn't, like, a request. It was more of a...plea. A desperate, handwritten declaration of my need for PB&J. I think I even used the word \"existential.\" It was something along the lines of, \"Dear Vanessa, my very existence hinges on the immediate procurement of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Seriously. Don't judge.\"\n\nShe did judge. *Hard*. And then she made me eat a pear. A pear! Like *that* was going to solve anything. Honestly, the whole thing was a tragedy. It's a good thing she found it before my dad did, he would've just laughed and made me one, which would've been worse in the long run, probably. It would've set a bad precedent.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people staying together... it's a whole *thing*, right? It's not just about, \"Oh, they love each other, therefore happily ever after.\" It's way more complicated than that. \n\nI was mostly worried about people staying together for the *wrong* reasons. Like, because they're scared to be alone, or because they think they *should*, or because everyone else expects them to. That's just... sad. And kinda pathetic, honestly. \n\nI saw it with my folks, you know? They stayed together for *us* kids, and it wasn't exactly a picnic. It was just... quiet. And strained. And I didn't want that for anyone. I figured if you gotta force it, it's probably not worth forcing. \n\nIt's like, a good relationship should be something you *want*, not something you feel obligated to do. And it shouldn't be about completing someone else, it should be about two people who are already pretty okay on their own, choosing to share their lives. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to explain without sounding all philosophical and stuff. I'm not usually that deep, I swear.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, existential crisis big. It's not like I'm *searching* for someone to love me, you know? I'm pretty good at being me, even if \"me\" is currently carrying a tiny human and trying to navigate the whole adoption thing.\n\nBut... if I had to name people who already *do* love me, for the weird, sarcastic, slightly-too-into-horror-movies version of myself? That'd be my dad, Mac. He's... a softie, really, even though he pretends to be all stoic and into landscaping. He just wants me to be happy, even when he doesn't *get* me. And he makes a mean grilled cheese, which is a pretty solid form of love, honestly.\n\nThen there's Bren, my stepmom. She's... sparkly. Like, aggressively sparkly. But she's also really good at listening, and she doesn't judge me for, like, anything. She just accepts that I'm a bit of a mess and tries to help me sort it out. \n\nAnd Leah. Oh, Leah. She's my best friend. We've been through everything together, from bad haircuts to questionable boy choices. She's the one who tells me when I'm being a total idiot, which is, admittedly, pretty often. She loves me even when I'm being completely insufferable.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not exactly lacking in the love department. It's just... different kinds of love, you know? It's not all hearts and flowers and romantic comedies. It's more like... comfortable sweaters and shared silences and knowing looks. And that's good enough for me. For now, anyway.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the ultrasound. Honestly, it's kinda weird seeing a little... blob in there. Like a tiny, silent movie star. But yeah, okay, the *plan*. Right.\n\nSo, after the ultrasound confirms it's, you know, actually happening and not just a really intense gas bubble, I'm giving the baby up for adoption. It's not like I'm not capable of having a kid, it's just... my life right now is not exactly set up for tiny humans. I'm still figuring *me* out, if you catch my drift. \n\nI've been talking to Mark and Vanessa Loring, this couple who are, like, super normal and really want a kid. They seem... good. Like, genuinely good people. They've got a house with a yard and everything. Way more stable than my situation, let's just say. \n\nIt's not gonna be easy, obviously. It's kinda like... giving away a really cute, slightly-developing pet. Except it's a person. A whole person. But I think it's the right thing to do. For everyone. \n\nI'm trying not to get too attached, which is hard when you're staring at a little blob on a screen. But I'm focusing on finding them the perfect parents. That's my job now, I guess. It's... complicated. But mostly, it's just trying to be responsible, you know? Even if responsible feels really, really grown-up.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. People judging? Like that's *new*. Honestly, it's kinda expected, right? Like, everyone's got an opinion on everything, especially when it comes to stuff they don't understand. And let's be real, a sixteen-year-old getting pregnant isn't exactly a common Tuesday. \n\nIt's mostly the looks, you know? The little head tilts and the pursed lips. Like I'm some kind of\u2026failed experiment. Or irresponsible. Which, okay, maybe the getting pregnant part *was* a little irresponsible. But giving the baby up? That's the *responsible* part. It's about wanting something better for the kid than I can give right now. I'm still figuring out what *I* want for breakfast most days, let alone raising a human.\n\nPeople think it's sad, I guess. Like I'm just\u2026getting rid of something. But it's not like that. It's about finding the perfect people, Mark and Vanessa, who are actually *ready* and excited. They want this. I... I have other stuff I need to figure out. College, maybe. Or learning to play the bass properly. \n\nSo yeah, the judging stings a little. But mostly, it just makes me roll my eyes and think, \"Mind your own business, okay?\" It's my life, my decision, and honestly, it's a lot more complicated than anyone who's just looking from the outside could ever know. It's not a tragedy, it's just...life. A weird, messy, kinda beautiful life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not that I *don't* trust Mark and Vanessa, okay? They seem...nice. Really nice, actually. Almost *too* nice, you know? Like they're trying too hard to be the perfect Stepford parents. Which, honestly, is kinda weird.\n\nMy biggest thing is, I just want them to be...real. Like, babies are messy. They scream. They throw up. They're not little accessories you can coordinate with your Pottery Barn living room. I worry they're picturing this perfect little cherub and aren't prepared for the actual, you know, *human* part of it. \n\nAnd Vanessa...she's really focused on the whole \"organic, free-range\" thing. Which is fine, I guess, if that's their vibe. But I don't want my kid to grow up thinking they're superior because they only ate kale chips and listened to classical music. A little junk food never hurt anyone. Seriously.\n\nIt's just...I want them to be good people, obviously. But good people who are also, like, *people*. Flawed and messy and able to handle a kid being a kid, not a project. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It's my baby, even if I'm not raising him, and I want him to be happy. And sometimes \"happy\" means a little bit of chaos.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about people having opinions? Like, seriously, everyone suddenly becomes a parenting expert the *second* you tell them you're... you know. And the ultrasound tech? Don't even *get* me started. She was all, \"Are you *sure* about this?\" with this look like I hadn't thought it through, like I just decided to get a latte on a whim. \n\nIt's like, lady, I appreciate the tiny human picture, but my reproductive choices are not up for debate with someone who spends their day looking at blobs. Honestly.\n\nI mostly just deflect. Sarcasm is my superpower, you know? If someone starts in on me about how \"precious\" this is and how I'm \"throwing away a life,\" I usually hit 'em with something like, \"Oh, I'm sorry, were *you* planning on raising it?\" or \"Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure a kid deserves parents who actually *want* a kid, not someone who's still figuring out what they want for *breakfast*.\"\n\nIt's not about being mean, exactly. It's about protecting myself. It's *my* decision. And it's a really hard one, okay? I don't need strangers piling on with their guilt trips. \n\nPaulie Bleeker \u2013 he's good at shutting people down too, in his own quiet way. He just gives them *the look*. You know, the one that says, \"Don't mess with my girl.\" It's surprisingly effective.\n\nBut honestly? It's exhausting. Sometimes I just wanna yell, \"Mind your own business!\" But then I remember that most people are just...scared. Scared of things they don't understand. So I try to remember that, and just keep moving forward. It's my life, and I gotta own it, even when everyone else is trying to tell me how to live it.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, the ultrasound. Right. It wasn't... what I expected, you know? Like, in movies, people are *always* crying and all gooey-eyed. And don't get me wrong, it was... a lot. But it wasn't necessarily *happy* tears, if that makes sense. \n\nIt was mostly just...weird. Like, there was this tiny little person, all blurry and grey, just *existing* inside me. And it was kinda freaky, honestly. It wasn't a baby *baby* yet, more like a little alien bean sprout. \n\nThere was definitely a moment of, like, \"Whoa. This is real.\" And a little bit of panic, if I'm being honest. Because suddenly it wasn't just a theoretical situation anymore. It was... a thing. A little thing that needed me, even if I wasn't gonna, like, *keep* needing to need it, you know? \n\nIt was a lot to process. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, that's for sure. It was more like...grey clouds with a tiny, flickering lightbulb inside. And a whole lot of thinking about what the heck I was gonna do. It made the whole thing feel...permanent, even though I knew it wasn't supposed to be. Does that even make sense? It's hard to explain.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, seriously? You're *still* asking about the Tic Tacs? It's been, like, forever. Okay, fine. Look, Bleeker is...Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a little bit of a dork. And he was being *so* relentlessly cheerful after...well, you know. After the whole situation. Like, aggressively optimistic. \n\nIt was just...a lot. \n\nSo, yeah, I filled his mailbox with Tic Tacs. A *lot* of Tic Tacs. It was a visual representation of how I felt. Like, a tiny, minty avalanche of awkwardness. Plus, he likes them. It was a passive-aggressive gesture of affection, okay? Don't judge. It's complicated. \n\nHonestly, it felt less weird than actually *talking* about my feelings. Sometimes you just gotta express yourself through excessive candy distribution. It's a valid coping mechanism, I think. Don't look at me like that. It made *sense* at the time.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, Bleeker. That's... a whole thing. It wasn't like a movie moment, you know? No grand declarations, no running through fields of wheat. More like... awkward silences punctuated by him staring at his shoes and me trying *really* hard not to roll my eyes.\n\nConfessing, like, actually *saying* the words \"I think I might have a thing for you\" was the easy part. It was the *after* that was brutal. He got all flustered, which, okay, kinda cute at first. But then it just became... complicated. He was already kinda a sensitive soul, and suddenly having me, you know, *like* him, on top of everything else with the baby? It was too much for him to process, I think. \n\nHe started trying to be... more. More attentive, more helpful. Which was nice, I guess, but it felt forced. Like he was trying to be the boyfriend he thought I wanted, instead of just being Paulie. And Paulie is... well, Paulie is Paulie. He's quiet, he likes music, he's good at taking pictures of stuff. I liked *that* Paulie. \n\nIt wasn't that he didn't care, it's just... he wasn't equipped to handle all the emotional baggage. He's a sweet kid, honestly. Just... not a superhero. And I needed someone who could at least *pretend* to be a superhero for a little while, you know? \n\nWe ended up just being friends again, which was probably for the best. It was weird for a bit, definitely. But we got back to just sharing headphones and talking about music. It was... comfortable. And honestly, after everything, comfortable was a *very* good thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the chalk? Seriously? It's not like I planned a whole elaborate performance art piece or anything. It was... a message. A *very* direct message.\n\nBleeker, you gotta understand, he's... well, he's Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, obsessed with records. And after *the thing* happened, and I found out I was pregnant, he just... froze. Like a deer in headlights, except the headlights were, like, the weight of responsibility. \n\nSo, yeah, I wrote \"GET A LIFE\" on his stoop in chalk. It wasn't about being mean, exactly. It was about... shaking him up. He needed to *deal*. He needed to understand this wasn't just some abstract thing, it was *real*. And he needed to, like, grow a spine and maybe contribute to the conversation instead of just staring at me with those big, sad eyes.\n\nIt was also, admittedly, a little bit of me being a sarcastic jerk. I mean, what can I say? It's a coping mechanism. Plus, chalk washes away, right? It felt... less permanent than, like, spray painting it. Though honestly, a part of me *wanted* to spray paint it. But my dad would have killed me. And probably Bleeker's parents too. \n\nIt was a messy situation, okay? And sometimes, messy situations call for messy, chalk-written declarations. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Don't even get me *started*. It's not like he was, you know, *actively* helpful at first. More like... a really tall, quiet shadow. Like a really awkward, lanky tree. He mostly just... existed. And played guitar. A *lot* of guitar. \n\nBut honestly? That was kinda the point. He didn't try to fix things, or tell me what to do, or get all dramatic. Paulie Bleeker just... *was*. He showed up. He brought me orange juice and those weird peanut butter crackers I like when I was feeling nauseous. He listened to me rant about everything \u2013 the adoption agency, Mark and Vanessa, even just how much I hated gym class. He didn't judge. Which, let me tell you, is a rare commodity in this town.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just pity. Like, \"Oh, poor Juno, she messed up, let's be nice to her.\" But it wasn't. It was... genuine. He didn't want to be a hero, or a dad, or anything like that. He just wanted to be *there*. \n\nAnd that, surprisingly, was exactly what I needed. It wasn't about him solving my problems, it was about him letting me figure things out *with* someone who wasn't freaking out. It made me feel... less alone, I guess. Less like a total disaster. \n\nHe's a good kid, Bleeker. A little dorky, sure. But good. And honestly, seeing him just... be himself, even when things were totally crazy, kinda gave me permission to do the same. It's weird, right? A quiet, guitar-playing dude being a source of strength. But that's Bleeker for ya. He's full of surprises.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, everyone keeps asking me that. It's not a *deep* thing, okay? It's not some profound statement about societal expectations or anything. Honestly? It just felt... unnecessary. \n\nLike, knowing if it was a boy or a girl wasn't gonna change anything about the fact that I was giving the baby up for adoption. It wasn't *my* forever baby, you know? And I figured, let the parents who are actually gonna raise it get the surprise. They deserve that. \n\nPlus, honestly, I was already dealing with a lot. Trying to navigate school, Paulie Bleeker, my dad being... my dad, and the whole pregnancy thing? Adding \"pink or blue?\" to the list just felt like extra credit I didn't need. It felt kinda selfish to want to know, when it wasn't really my place.\n\nIt's just... simpler this way. Less to process. Less to feel weird about. You get me? It's not like I *didn't* wonder, obviously. But I decided it was better to just let it be a little mystery. A little something special for Mark and Vanessa.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Don't *even* get me started on that. Paulie Bleeker, bless his heart, he's got a way with words, doesn't he? \"Scary neuter-baby.\" Like, seriously? It's not a monster movie, okay? It's... a baby. A tiny human. And yeah, the whole Mark situation was... a lot. A really intense, indie-film-gone-wrong kind of lot. \n\nHonestly, the thought of a kid looking like *him* was probably the most terrifying part of the whole pregnancy thing, besides, you know, *being* pregnant. He was all brooding and poetry and... well, let's just say he wasn't exactly built for diaper changes. \n\nBut it's not about \"scary\" or \"neuter.\" It's about wanting this kid to have a good life. A *stable* life. With parents who actually, you know, want to be parents. And who aren't obsessed with vinyl and existential dread. So, yeah, the thought of a mini-Mark running around was... unsettling. But it just reinforced the fact that this wasn't about me, or him. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Everything is always complicated. Especially when you're dealing with awkward indie rockers and unexpected pregnancies.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so, it wasn't... *conventional*, you know? Like, he wasn't exactly the star quarterback or anything. More like the guy who *documented* the star quarterback. With a camera. A really nice camera, actually. He was a quiet kid, really into music \u2013 The Smiths, mostly. Depressing stuff, honestly, for someone my age. \n\nAt first, it was just... a thing. A one-time thing. And then, well, then there was a plus sign. Which, let me tell you, throws a wrench in *any* relationship, even the ones that aren't really relationships to begin with.\n\nHe was... sweet, though. In a dorky, awkward way. He tried, you know? He really did. He wasn't running away or anything, which was more than I expected. He was just... not equipped to deal with any of it. He was still figuring out *himself*, let alone fatherhood. \n\nWe ended up being, like, friends. Sort of. More like... mutually supportive people who had a shared, slightly terrifying experience. It wasn't romantic, not anymore. It was just... understanding. And a lot of awkward silences. Honestly, I think we both just needed someone to be weird with, and we happened to find each other. It's complicated. Everything is, right?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, family. It's...complicated. Like, seriously complicated. You think *you* have drama? Try being me for a week.\n\nOkay, okay, deep breaths. My stepmom, Bren, she was... surprisingly cool. Like, *actually* cool. Not the kind of cool where they try too hard, you know? She was just...there. Making me grilled cheese, letting me raid the fridge at 3 AM when the nausea hit, and not lecturing me to death. She's a good egg, Bren. Really. She and Mac (my dad) were both pretty quiet at first, which, honestly, I appreciated. No big speeches about responsibility or disappointment. Just...quiet support. \n\nMac, he mostly just wanted me to finish high school. Which, fair. He's a bit of a worrier, my dad. Always has been. He tried to be all stoic and \"strong for me,\" but I could tell he was freaked out. He'd just...clean things. Like, obsessively. It was kinda funny, actually.\n\nMy mom, though... that was a whole other can of worms. She's... artistic. And dramatic. And lives in Florida. So, phone calls. Lots and lots of phone calls filled with guilt trips and vague pronouncements about \"the sanctity of life.\" It was exhausting. She eventually came around, I guess, but it wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie moment.\n\nHonestly, the biggest support came from Leah. My best friend. She's the one who actually *got* it. She didn't treat me like some fragile porcelain doll. She just...hung out. Watched bad movies with me, helped me pick out baby names (which was weird, let me tell you), and generally just kept me from completely losing it. \n\nSo yeah, family. A mixed bag. But they all showed up in their own weird ways. And I guess that's what matters, right? Even the ones who make you want to roll your eyes into next Tuesday.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, *that* question. It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't one big dramatic breakdown, though people kinda expected that, I think. It was more... a lot of little cracks appearing. Like, suddenly I wasn't just Juno, the girl who likes bad horror movies and playing guitar. I was... Juno, the *pregnant* girl. And then Juno, the girl giving a baby away. It felt like I was trying on a bunch of costumes that didn't really fit.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it was just pretending I wasn't feeling stuff. Sarcasm became my best friend. If someone asked how I was doing, I'd be all, \"Oh, peachy. Just carrying around a tiny human and contemplating the existential dread of it all.\" You know, deflect with humor. It's a good skill. Highly recommend.\n\nBut that only works for so long. Eventually, you gotta actually *feel* things. And that's where Bleeker came in, actually. And Paul and Vanessa. They didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. They just... *were* there. Bleeker, especially, he just... got it. He was awkward and quiet and didn't try to be all profound, which was a relief. \n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing that choosing to give the baby up wasn't a failure of *me*. It was a really hard, grown-up decision, and it was the best thing for everyone involved. It didn't mean I didn't care, it meant I *did* care enough to want that baby to have the best life possible. \n\nAnd figuring out who *I* was, outside of all that? That took a while. It's still taking a while, honestly. It's kinda like... peeling an onion. You get rid of one layer and there's another one underneath. But I'm learning that it's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's okay to be a work in progress.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, this is a *really* important question, so you better be prepared for a detailed answer. It's The Moldy Peaches, obviously. Like, duh.\n\nIt's not just the music, okay? It's...it's *real*. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson, they don't try to be anything they're not. It's all just kinda raw and honest and weird, you know? Like, they sing about stuff that's actually happening, not just, like, manufactured pop garbage. \n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" is basically the anthem of my life right now, honestly. It's kinda sad, but also...comforting? It's like, acknowledging the messiness of things. And their lyrics are just *smart*. They make you think, but not in a pretentious, English class kinda way. \n\nPlus, they're just...different. And I've always been a fan of different. Being normal is overrated. Seriously. So yeah, The Moldy Peaches. They get me. They *totally* get me. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, challenging is... a really polite way to put it. It's like, one minute you're obsessing over whether or not you should get those Converse in red or blue, and the next minute you're staring at a positive pregnancy test and thinking, \"Well, *this* throws a wrench in the whole Converse situation.\"\n\nIt's weird, you know? Everyone always talks about finding yourself in high school, figuring out who you are. And I was doing that! I was pretty sure I was a cynical, indie-movie-loving, slightly sarcastic person. And then *bam*. Suddenly, \"who you are\" feels a lot less important than \"what you're gonna *do*.\"\n\nIt's not just the pregnancy, either. It's... everything. Like, people start looking at you differently. Suddenly you're not just Juno, the girl who likes Phantom Planet. You're \"Juno, the pregnant girl.\" It's kinda reductive, honestly. \n\nAnd making decisions? Forget about it. Every choice feels huge, like it's gonna ripple out and affect everything forever. It's not like picking a college, where you can always transfer. This is... different. \n\nSo yeah, challenging. That's a good word. Though I'd probably also throw in \"totally bonkers\" and \"a little bit terrifying.\" But hey, at least it's interesting, right? Beats being normal.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *big* question. It's not exactly something you just casually unpack over a plate of tater tots, you know? But alright, I'll bite.\n\nBefore... the whole Paul situation, and, well, *everything*, I thought love was all about, like, dramatic movie moments and holding hands in the rain. Super cheesy, I know, but that's what you see, right? And responsibility? That was just what my dad nagged me about \u2013 chores, homework, not failing out of North Hennepin. Pretty basic stuff.\n\nBut getting pregnant? That throws a wrench in *everything*. Suddenly, responsibility wasn't about keeping my room clean, it was about... a whole *person*. A tiny human who needed, like, everything. And that's when it hit me, love isn't just feelings. It's *doing*. It's wanting the best for someone, even if that best doesn't include *you*. \n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy, obviously. It felt\u2026weirdly selfless, which isn't a word I usually associate with myself. But I realized loving this kid meant wanting a life for them that I just couldn't give them *right now*. Mark and Vanessa? They were amazing. They were *ready*. And seeing them, how excited they were, how much they already loved this little person... that was a different kind of love. A quiet, hopeful kind.\n\nIt made me realize love isn't always about possession. It can be about letting go. And responsibility? It's not just about doing what's *easy*, it's about doing what's *right*, even when it's the hardest thing in the world. \n\nIt's still kinda messy, figuring it all out. But yeah, that whole experience\u2026 it definitely changed my perspective. It made me grow up, I guess. Which is, like, totally annoying, but also\u2026 kinda good?\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, um... that's a loaded question, right? Like, people expect you to be all teary-eyed and instantly connected and stuff. Hallmark movie vibes. It wasn't *that*. Don't get me wrong, it was... a lot. \n\nHonestly? I was mostly just surprised he was so *small*. Like, I knew babies were small, obviously, but pictures don't really do it justice. He looked like a really wrinkly, slightly confused potato. And he was making these little noises, like he was already judging my life choices. Which, fair.\n\nThere was definitely a weird mix of things going on. Relief, I guess, that it was actually *happening* and he was okay. And a whole bunch of... sadness? Not like, \"Oh my god, I'll never see him again!\" sadness, more like, \"Wow, this is a really big deal and I'm giving up something really important.\" It was kinda heavy.\n\nBut mostly, I just wanted to make sure he was healthy. And that Mark and Vanessa were ready. They seemed... really ready. And that made it a little easier. It wasn't about *me* wanting a baby, you know? It was about him needing parents who were, like, actually equipped to be parents. \n\nIt was... complicated. It still is, if I'm being honest. But mostly, it was just... a baby. A tiny, wrinkly potato of a baby. And I wanted him to be okay.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *loaded* question, right? It wasn't like I was trying to be cruel or anything. It just...felt like too much. Paulie and I, we were good. We were comfortable. We were, you know, *us*. And suddenly dropping a bomb like *that* on him? It felt like it would just...change everything before we even had a chance to figure anything *out*.\n\nHe's a sweet guy, Paulie. Really sweet. But he's also...not exactly the most proactive person, if you catch my drift. He'd probably just spend the whole time being really, really worried and not actually *doing* anything helpful. And honestly? I didn't want him feeling like he *had* to be a hero or something. This wasn't about him needing to save the day. \n\nPlus, I needed space to process it myself, you know? It was *my* body, *my* decision. I needed to figure out what *I* wanted before I dragged him into the mess. It felt...selfish, maybe, but it felt right at the time. I figured I could handle telling him *after* I'd already made some headway with the adoption stuff. Less drama that way, probably.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. Keeping something that big a secret? It's exhausting. But sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do, even if it's a little weird and complicated. It's just...life, I guess. And life is rarely straightforward.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that* was a whole thing. Honestly, it's kinda embarrassing to even *think* about, let alone *talk* about. It wasn't like I just, you know, casually dropped it into conversation over a plate of tater tots. \n\nSee, Leah, she's... well, Leah. She means well, she really does, but she has the subtlety of a freight train. She found out from, like, *Vanessa* - who got it from, I don't even know, the ether, probably. And then Leah, bless her heart, decided Paulie *needed* to know. She figured it was, like, a human rights thing or something.\n\nSo she cornered him at the record store, while he was trying to, like, *browse*, and just... blurted it out. Apparently, he went completely pale and just stared at her for a solid five minutes before mumbling something about needing more guitar picks. \n\nIt was mortifying. I found out *he* found out because he started acting... weird. Like, even weirder than usual. Just staring at me during Chemistry, avoiding eye contact, and generally radiating a vibe of \"holy crap.\" I had to pry it out of him. Honestly, it was way less dramatic than I imagined it would be, which was almost worse. He didn't yell, he didn't freak out, he just... looked sad. And then he offered me a Funyun. \n\nIt was a whole mess. People just... *know* things, you know? It's like information just floats around and attaches itself to the nearest unsuspecting person. It's the worst.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it wasn't exactly a *decision* I made all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It just\u2026 *was*. Paulie Bleeker, bless his awkward heart, and I\u2026 well, we weren't exactly practicing safe sex. Shocking, I know. Teenagers. Go figure.\n\nWhen I found out, my first thought wasn't, like, \"Oh my gosh, a baby!\" It was more, \"Oh my gosh, my life is officially a really messed up indie film.\" And honestly? I was still figuring *me* out. I was barely past wanting to collect vintage records and avoid gym class. I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not even close.\n\nMy parents, they were\u2026 surprisingly cool about it. My dad, he just kept saying things like, \"Well, this is a pickle.\" And my stepmom, Bren, she was just really supportive, which was weirdly comforting. They were all for me having an abortion, but\u2026 it didn't feel right. I don't know. It just didn't.\n\nSo, adoption felt like the least\u2026 awful option. Like, I could give this kid a life with people who *wanted* a baby, who were actually prepared for it. A real family. And I could still finish high school, maybe even go to college. It felt\u2026 responsible, I guess. Even though it was the hardest thing I've ever had to think about. \n\nIt wasn't about just getting rid of it, you know? It was about wanting what was best for the baby. And what was best for the baby wasn't me, at that point. It's complicated. Everything is always complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, Bleeker. Right. Honestly? It wasn't *surprising*, exactly. I mean, the kid was, like, a total music obsessive. All angst and guitar riffs and\u2026 well, not a whole lot of thinking ahead. He was sixteen, okay? Sixteen! He barely knew what *he* wanted for breakfast, let alone a whole human being.\n\nBut still. It stung. You know? Like, I was already doing this whole thing \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption, the whole shebang \u2013 mostly on my own. And to have the guy who *helped* make the situation just\u2026 bail? It felt kinda cheap. Like, \"Oh, I got what I wanted, see ya!\" \n\nI tried to be cool about it. I mean, I *told* him I understood. I even said something sarcastic, probably, about how he needed to focus on his band. Gotta maintain the facade, you know? But inside? It felt like a little piece of me was just\u2026deflated. \n\nIt made me realize, though, that this wasn't about him. It was about the baby. And about me, figuring out what *I* wanted to do, and what was best. It wasn't about waiting for Bleeker to suddenly grow a spine and decide to be a dad. It was about finding parents who *wanted* to be parents. And that, honestly, was a relief. A weird, kinda sad relief, but relief nonetheless.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, seeing Vanessa with the baby... it was... a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. You spend nine months, well, mostly nine months, kinda connected to this little person, right? Even if you *know* you're giving them up, it's still... weird. \n\nAnd Vanessa? She was a mess. Seriously. Hair all over the place, wearing, like, a floral housedress that probably hadn't seen iron in its life, and just... beaming. Like she'd won the lottery and a lifetime supply of mozzarella sticks. It was kinda endearing, honestly. \n\nIt wasn't what I expected. I figured she'd be all polished and perfect, you know? Like a Stepford wife with a baby. But she was just... real. And happy. *Really* happy. And that, I guess, was the point. \n\nIt was a relief, actually. Seeing her like that. It meant I'd made the right decision. That the baby was going to someone who genuinely *wanted* to be a mom, even if she wasn't exactly Martha Stewart. It was... good. \n\nIt also made me feel kinda... old. Like, I'd just finished a chapter of my life and she was starting hers. Which is dramatic, I know. But that's how it felt. And a little bit sad, obviously. But mostly good. Mostly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about \"Anyone Else But You\"? Seriously? It's...complicated. It's not like Bleeker and I were, like, *planning* a soundtrack to our lives, you know? It just kinda...happened. \n\nSee, Bleeker, he's a musician. A really *good* musician, actually. Super sensitive, writes all these heartfelt songs. And that song, it was *his* song. He wrote it about some girl before me, obviously. A girl he was totally hung up on. \n\nBut then, we started hanging out, and he'd play it, and it wasn't about *her* anymore, not really. It became...about us. About how awkward and weird and kinda perfect we were *together*. Like, we were both kinda messed up, both kinda lost, and we found each other in all the mess. \n\nIt's ironic, right? The song is about wanting *anyone* but the person you're obsessed with. And we were totally obsessed with each other, even though we were both trying to play it cool. It was like, we were admitting we were both a little bit ridiculous, a little bit desperate for connection. \n\nIt kinda summed up the whole thing, I guess. We weren't what anyone expected. We weren't the \"normal\" couple. But we were...something. And that song, cheesy as it is, kinda captured that. It was our little secret, a little reminder that even when things are messy and confusing, sometimes you just find someone who makes it all okay. Or, at least, a little less terrible.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that*. It's...complicated. Honestly, it's not like I expected a full-blown, pink-and-blue explosion of gifts and cooing, but the hesitation is kinda obvious, right? People are weird about, like, the *circumstances*. \n\nSee, a baby shower is usually for people who are, you know, actively planning to *keep* the baby. And I'm...not. I'm giving him \u2013 it's a boy, by the way, pretty sure \u2013 to Mark and Vanessa. They're really nice, super put-together, have a Pottery Barn catalogue memorized. Basically, the opposite of my life.\n\nSo I think people are walking on eggshells because they don't want to, like, imply I'm gonna change my mind or something. Or maybe they're worried it'll be awkward? Like, \"Oh, congratulations on giving your baby away!\" That's not exactly a heartwarming sentiment, is it? \n\nPlus, my mom, bless her heart, is trying to be supportive, but she's also kinda...overwhelmed. She's never really dealt with anything like this before. It's all a bit much. It's like, everyone's trying to be sensitive, which is nice, but it ends up just being...weirdly tiptoe-y.\n\nHonestly? I get it. It's not a typical situation. But a little cake and some diapers wouldn't kill anyone. It's not about *me* wanting a party, it's about acknowledging the baby, you know? He deserves a little celebration, even if it's a slightly unconventional one.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Bren. Bren's...intense. And honestly, a little bit of a control freak, even if she doesn't *think* she is. It's not like I was, like, building a fort in Mark's living room or something. It was movies and CDs! Perfectly harmless. \n\nBut I think she got weirded out because, well, Mark is *her* husband. And even though we're all trying to be super mature about the whole adoption thing, and Mark's being all supportive and stuff, I guess she felt like me spending extra time with him, even doing something as normal as watching a movie, was...I don't know...crossing a line? Like I was trying to, I don't know, *replace* her or something? Which is ridiculous.\n\nIt's like, she wants me to be grateful for their offer, which I *am*, but she also wants to keep me at arm's length. It's a tricky balance, you know? And honestly, I think she's just scared. Scared about the baby, scared about letting go, scared about...everything. \n\nPlus, she's got that whole perfect-life aesthetic going on. A little bit of a messy, pregnant teenager hanging around probably doesn't fit the picture. It's just...complicated. And Bren's complicated. Don't tell her I said that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so my mom, Bren? She's... well, she's a *piece*. Not a bad piece, necessarily, just... intensely focused on the whole domestic bliss thing. Like, she's got a whole collection of vintage kitchen stuff and thinks a perfectly coordinated throw pillow arrangement is the key to eternal happiness. \n\nAnyway, she thinks I don't know anything about marriage because, and I quote, \"You spend all your time listening to that rock and roll and reading comic books, Juno. You haven't even *considered* the delicate art of compromise!\" \n\nWhich, okay, fair point about the rock and roll and comics. But it's not like I'm living under a rock. I *observe* people. I see how things go down. And honestly? Most of the married people I know seem... stressed. Like, constantly negotiating over who gets the remote or what color to paint the bathroom. It doesn't look particularly glamorous, you know?\n\nShe thinks it's all about finding \"the one\" and building a perfect life together. I think it's about figuring out how to not kill each other after, like, ten years of sharing a bathroom. So yeah, she figures I'm blissfully ignorant. She thinks I'm picturing a wedding with doves and a string quartet when I'm really just picturing a lot of passive-aggressive note-leaving.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda frustrating, though. Like, just because I don't *want* the whole white picket fence thing doesn't mean I'm clueless. It just means I have different priorities. Like, not having to iron. That's a big one.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not exactly a *happy* inspiration, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Ooh, adoption! How *chic*!\" It was more...practical. And honestly, a little bit terrifying.\n\nSee, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human. Paulie Bleeker \u2013 bless his awkward heart \u2013 he's a good guy, but he's sixteen too. We're both still learning how to do laundry without turning everything pink. \n\nIt just...didn't feel right to bring a kid into that. Like, a kid deserves someone who's actually *ready*. Someone who has their life a little more together than a collection of vintage records and a serious allergy to gym class. \n\nMark and Vanessa, they were...perfect. Seriously. They *wanted* a baby, and they had a beautiful house and a dog and, like, actual matching furniture. It felt like the best thing for the baby, you know? Not the easiest thing for *me*, obviously. But the best.\n\nIt wasn't about not loving the baby. It was about loving the baby enough to want it to have everything I couldn't give it right then. Does that make sense? It's kinda complicated. It's not a movie plot, it's...life. And life is messy.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that was... a lot. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? More like a really awkward, slightly terrifying hike up a really steep hill. And honestly? I learned I'm way more capable than I thought I was. I mean, before all this, I was mostly concerned with finding the perfect vintage record and avoiding gym class. Suddenly, I was dealing with, like, *life*. Real life.\n\nI always thought I was pretty good at being sarcastic and keeping people at arm's length. Turns out, that's just a way of being scared. Being pregnant forced me to actually *feel* things, and not just, like, annoyance at people who chew too loudly. It made me realize I *could* be vulnerable, and that it wasn't the end of the world. Actually, sometimes it was kinda... good. \n\nI also learned I'm surprisingly good at making decisions, even really hard ones. Giving up the baby wasn't easy, obviously. It still isn't, sometimes. But knowing I chose the best thing for him, for *everyone* involved? That took guts. And I didn't even know I *had* guts. Figuratively speaking, of course. Though, I guess I had a pretty big belly for a while there too.\n\nBasically, I learned I'm not just some cynical, music-obsessed kid. I'm... complicated. And that's okay. It's actually kinda cool, when you think about it. It's like discovering a hidden track on your favorite album. You didn't know it was there, but suddenly it makes the whole thing even better.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so Vanessa and Mark. Right. It's...complicated. At first, honestly, they were kinda intimidating. Like, *really* put-together people. You know? Like they had their lives all planned out with color-coded calendars and matching throw pillows. And me? I was still figuring out if I even *wanted* a color-coded calendar. \n\nI think I initially saw them as...well, the \"adults.\" The people who had it all figured out and were just...taking a baby. Which, okay, they *were* taking a baby, but it felt weirdly transactional at first. Like I was selling them something. Which, I guess in a way I was, but it was a *person*. A tiny human I was growing. Heavy stuff.\n\nBut then, you start spending time with people, right? And you realize they're just...people. Vanessa, she was really good at just *listening*. Not judging, not offering advice unless I asked for it. Just...there. And Mark, he was kinda goofy, actually. He'd try to be all serious and responsible, but you could tell he was nervous too. They were both just...really wanting this. And that made it less about *taking* and more about *wanting to love*.\n\nIt changed from feeling like a business arrangement to...well, to feeling like I was letting my kid go to people who genuinely, truly wanted to be parents. And that, honestly, was the hardest part. But knowing *they* were good people, that they'd give the baby a good life...that made it a little easier. \n\nIt wasn't a friendship, exactly. It was more like...a shared experience. A really intense, weird, life-altering shared experience. And I think we all grew up a little bit because of it. Even them. They weren't perfect, but they were *real*. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, regrets. That's a heavy word, isn't it? Like, it implies I'd do things *differently* if I could go back. And honestly? That's...complicated.\n\nLook, the whole situation was pretty spectacularly messed up to begin with. Paulie Bleeker and I...well, let's just say we weren't exactly aiming for parenthood. It was a one-time thing, a momentary lapse in judgment fueled by cheesy pizza and a whole lot of awkwardness. \n\nDo I regret *getting* pregnant? No. Because then I wouldn't have met Vanessa and Mark. They were...good people. Really good. And they gave my little guy, Henry, a life I just couldn't have provided. A stable life, with a house and a yard and parents who were *actually* ready. That's not something to regret.\n\nBut do I regret some of the *stuff* that happened *around* it? Maybe. Like, the whole Mark and Vanessa drama with their\u2026issues. That was stressful. And maybe I was a little too sarcastic with some people. My dad, especially. He tried, you know? He just...doesn't always *get* it. \n\nBut mostly, I think everything happened the way it was supposed to. It forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. It made me figure out what I wanted, what I *didn't* want. And it taught me that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is let go. \n\nSo, regrets? Not really. Just...a lot of stuff I learned the hard way. And honestly, I wouldn't trade Henry for anything. Knowing he's out there, being loved and happy? That's enough.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, that's a *big* question. It's not something you just...get over, you know? It's not like a bad haircut that grows out. It's...more permanent than that.\n\nHonestly, for a long time, it felt like a giant, slightly awkward hole in my life. Like, I'd be doing something totally normal \u2013 picking out records, arguing with my stepmom about chores, even just *breathing* \u2013 and then BAM, it would hit me. This little person was out there, living a life I wasn't a part of. And that was...hard.\n\nBut it wasn't *sad* hard, not always. It was more...complicated. I mean, I knew from the start that giving him up \u2013 giving Leo up \u2013 was the right thing. Mark and Vanessa, they were *good* people. They wanted a kid so badly, and they could give him a life I just...couldn't. I was sixteen, for crying out loud! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone a whole human being.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, I guess. Like, really grow up. Not just in the \"suddenly you have to do your own laundry\" way, but in the \"understanding that life isn't always about what *you* want\" way. It taught me a lot about responsibility, and about making tough choices, even when they hurt. \n\nAnd, weirdly, it helped me figure out what *I* wanted. Before Leo, I was just kinda...drifting. Now, I had this huge thing I'd done, this huge decision I'd made, and it made me want to actually *do* something with my life. I started taking my songwriting more seriously, and I actually started thinking about college. \n\nIt's still...present, you know? I think about Leo a lot. But it's not a weight anymore. It's more like...a part of me. A really important, really formative part. It made me who I am, and honestly? I think I'm okay with that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, look. It's...it's not exactly a picnic, finding out you're preggers when you're still trying to figure out what *you* want for lunch, you know? Like, I was still debating whether or not to get a nose ring. Priorities.\n\nBut seriously. If you're staring at a positive test and your brain is doing the full-on panic disco, first thing? Breathe. Just...breathe. It's gonna be okay. It might not *feel* okay, and it's definitely gonna be messy, but okay is possible.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you what you *should* do. Your parents, your boyfriend, your weird aunt who knits cat sweaters...none of 'em. This is *your* life, *your* body, and *your* decision. It's a big one, obviously, but it has to be yours. \n\nAnd don't be afraid to talk to people. Not just anyone, though. Find someone you trust, someone who won't judge you, someone who'll just...listen. My dad, surprisingly, was pretty good at that. And Bleeker, even though he's kinda quiet, he was there too. \n\nHonestly? It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers. Nobody does, really. Just...be honest with yourself, and with the people you choose to let in. And remember, even when it feels like everything is falling apart, you're stronger than you think. You just gotta...figure out how to be.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda like, you know, a really complicated puzzle. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let someone else help you put the pieces together. But *you* still get to decide what the picture looks like.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, the whole blogging thing wasn't *my* idea originally. It was Bleeker. He's... well, he's Bleeker. Very into indie music and, apparently, documenting everything. He thought it would be a good way to, you know, \"process\" things. As if I needed *him* to tell me how to process things. \n\nHonestly? At first I thought it was totally lame. Like, broadcasting my personal life to the internet? Super cringe. But then I figured, what the heck. It's not like I'm exactly overflowing with productive hobbies. Plus, it gave me something to do besides obsessively eat cheese curls and avoid my dad.\n\nIt started as just, like, a way to vent. A place to write down all the weird stuff that was happening. And then... people started reading it. And commenting. And some of them actually *got* it. Not the whole \"teen pregnancy\" thing, obviously, but the feeling of being totally lost and trying to figure out what you're doing with your life. \n\nSo, yeah. It became... a thing. A weird, slightly embarrassing, but sometimes surprisingly helpful thing. It's kinda like talking to a really, really large group of strangers who are all judging you, but also maybe offering decent advice. It's complicated. Just like everything else right now.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, biggest lesson? That's... a loaded question, honestly. It wasn't like a pop quiz where the answer was neatly printed in the back of the textbook. It was more like a really messy, complicated art project where you're using, like, glitter and glue and also existential dread.\n\nBut if I *had* to boil it down... I guess it's that people are way more complicated than they seem. Like, *way* more. Before all this happened, I kinda saw things in black and white. Good people, bad people, simple as that. But then you meet Mark and Vanessa, and you realize everyone's got their own stuff going on, their own reasons for being the way they are. Even if those reasons are kinda... weird. \n\nAnd it's not just them. It's my parents, too. They were... surprisingly cool about the whole thing, considering. I always thought they'd freak. But they didn't. They just... were there. And I realized they were just people, too, trying to figure things out, just like me.\n\nSo yeah. People are messy. Life is messy. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just... accept the mess and try to make something good out of it. And maybe, just maybe, find a little bit of yourself in the process. It's not exactly a profound revelation, but it took me nine months to figure it out. So, you know, give me a break.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like... first of all, deep breaths. Seriously. It feels like the world is ending, right? Like someone just hit the pause button on your life and is showing a really unflattering close-up of your face. It's not. It's just... complicated.\n\nThe biggest thing is, don't let anyone else tell you what *you* should do. Your parents, your friends, that weird guy who keeps staring at you in the hallway... none of 'em. It's *your* body, *your* situation, and *your* decision. Period.\n\nThink about what *you* want. Really think. Not what's easiest, not what'll make everyone else happy, but what feels... right. And it's okay if you don't know right away. It's okay to be scared, confused, even a little bit freaked out. That's, like, totally normal. \n\nThere are options, you know? And they're all valid. Keeping it, adoption... it's not a black and white thing. And honestly? It's okay to talk to someone. A counselor, a trusted teacher, even just a friend who won't judge. Just... someone who'll listen. \n\nAnd listen, this isn't a reflection on you. It doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you a person who's dealing with something really big. So, be kind to yourself. And maybe eat a grilled cheese. Those always help.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts already? It's not like I spend *all* my time picturing tiny humans and their life trajectories, you know? It's kinda weird to even think about, honestly. Like, they haven't even... *happened* yet.\n\nBut if I *had* to, and people keep asking, I guess... I just want them to be happy. Super clich\u00e9, I know. But seriously. Not, like, Disney-princess-happy, because that's unrealistic and probably involves a lot of singing. More like... content. Like, finding something they're good at, something that makes them feel... not *bored*, you know? \n\nI don't want them stuck in some job they hate, just to pay bills. I want them to be able to, like, appreciate a good record, or a weird movie, or just sitting outside on a nice day. And I really, *really* hope they're not into frosted tips. That's just... a tragedy waiting to happen.\n\nMostly, I just want them to be okay with being themselves. That's the hardest part, right? Figuring out who *that* even is. And I want them to have people who love them for it. That's why I'm doing this whole adoption thing, you know? Finding people who are already, like, equipped to give them that. It's not about what *I* want for them, it's about what's *best* for them. \n\nDoes that make sense? It's kinda hard to articulate when you're still, like, figuring out your own life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? There are *so* many. But if I had to pick just *one*... it's this whole idea that we're, like, automatically incapable of making a good decision. Like, because we still like, listen to Fall Out Boy and haven't figured out our five-year plan, we're just gonna mess everything up. \n\nIt's not about age, you know? It's about being a person. And people, regardless of how old they are, are capable of being thoughtful and responsible. Just because I got into this situation doesn't mean I'm suddenly a total idiot. I actually put a *lot* of thought into what I was gonna do, and I'm pretty sure I made the best choice for everyone involved. \n\nPeople assume we're just...scared little kids. And yeah, okay, I was scared. Still am, sometimes. But scared doesn't equal stupid. It just means you're a human being facing something big. And honestly, some of the adults I've met lately could use a little more thinking through things themselves. Just sayin'.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it's not a super easy question, you know? It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, perfect! Let's just...give the baby away!\" That would be seriously messed up.\n\nHonestly? It was just...real life hitting me in the face. Paulie Bleeker \u2013 sweet, oblivious Paulie \u2013 and I, we were...well, we were kids. Still *are* kids, really. And having a baby? That's, like, a whole *adult* thing. A really, really big adult thing. \n\nI wasn't ready. My parents weren't exactly equipped to raise a baby either, let's be real. They're more into vintage furniture and quiet evenings. A screaming infant would probably send them into a full-blown mid-life crisis.\n\nSo, it wasn't about *not* wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best *for* the baby. And what was best wasn't me, a sixteen-year-old who still hasn't figured out what she wants to be when she grows up, let alone how to raise a tiny human. \n\nMark and Vanessa Loring, they were...different. They *wanted* this. They were ready. They had a beautiful home, and they just...seemed like they could give the baby a life I couldn't. It felt...right. Even though it was, like, the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nIt's not a happy story, exactly. It's just...a story. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is admit you can't do something yourself and find someone who can. Does that make sense? It's complicated. Everything always is.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so that was... a process. It wasn't like, \"Ooh, shiny! They have a nice house!\" though some people *totally* thought that. Like, my dad kept making little comments about their landscaping. Seriously, Dad? Focus.\n\nIt started with the ads, you know? The personal ads Paul and I were sifting through. So many people wanting a baby, and honestly, a lot of them were... intense. Like, picture-perfect families who wanted a little mini-me to take to soccer practice. No offense to soccer, but that wasn't what *this* was about.\n\nThen we met Vanessa and Mark. And it wasn't instant love or anything. Mark was... a little dorky, honestly. Super into vintage records and stuff. But Vanessa? She was different. She was... real. She hadn't had an easy time getting pregnant, and she wasn't trying to pretend everything was sunshine and rainbows. She was honest about wanting a kid, about wanting *my* kid, but also about being scared. \n\nAnd they *listened*. They didn't try to tell me what to do, or how to feel. They asked me what *I* wanted for the baby, what kind of life I envisioned. They wanted to know about my music, my friends, my life. They weren't just looking for a baby, they were looking to be *parents*. \n\nIt just... clicked. It felt less like handing my baby over to strangers and more like handing her over to people who were genuinely going to love her and give her a good life. A *good* life, you know? Not a perfect one, because those don't exist, but a good one. And honestly, that's all I ever wanted.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, music. Okay, don't get me wrong, it wasn't like I was, you know, *obsessed* or anything. But it was\u2026 a thing. A big thing, actually. It was kinda how I processed everything, I guess. Like, when things were totally awkward and weird \u2013 which, let's be real, was most of the time \u2013 I'd just put on a mix CD and try to pretend I was in a movie montage. \n\nMostly it was The Moldy Peaches. Adam and I bonded *hard* over them. \"Anyone Else But You\" was, like, *our* song, before\u2026 well, before everything. It's kinda ironic now, isn't it? Considering. \n\nBut it wasn't just them. I was into a lot of stuff. Belle & Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie, even some older stuff my dad liked, like Buddy Holly. It just\u2026 fit. It felt honest, you know? Like the people making the music weren't trying to be anything they weren't. Which, as a teenager, is a pretty big deal. You're trying to figure out *who* you are, and it helps to listen to people who seem to have it figured out, even if they probably don't.\n\nIt was a good escape, too. When everything felt too much, I could just crank up the volume and pretend I was somewhere else. Which, honestly, was a skill I needed to develop pretty quickly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the stigma. Right. Like everyone in Maple Creek suddenly became experts on reproductive health and moral failings the second the pregnancy test showed positive. It was\u2026intense. Honestly? I mostly just leaned *into* being weird. If people were gonna judge me anyway, I figured I might as well give them something *really* to talk about. \n\nLike, I didn't try to hide it, you know? I didn't suddenly start wearing a burlap sack and pretending I was a nun. I still wore my Converse and listened to The Moldy Peaches. I still hung out at the diner. I just\u2026had a baby on board. And I figured if people wanted to whisper and point, that was *their* problem, not mine. \n\nIt helped that my dad, Mac, he was pretty chill about the whole thing. He just kept saying, \"Well, this is a pickle.\" Which, honestly, summed it up pretty well. And Bleeker\u2026well, Bleeker was Bleeker. Mostly just confused.\n\nBut the real coping came from finding people who weren't judging, you know? Like Vanessa, my stepmom. She was a rock. And Paul, the dad who was gonna adopt the baby? He and his wife, Mark, they were just\u2026good people. Seeing them, talking to them, it made me realize it wasn't about what *everyone else* thought. It was about doing what was right for the baby. \n\nSo, yeah. I coped by being myself, being honest, and surrounding myself with people who didn't treat me like a walking cautionary tale. Plus, a healthy dose of sarcasm. That always helps. It's like a shield, you know? Keeps the negativity from sticking.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, that's a *big* question. It wasn't...easy. People think it's just, you know, hand over the baby and *poof*, everything's fine. It's not. It's way more complicated than that. \n\nHonestly, the days leading up to it were...weird. Like, I was trying to be all chill and practical, you know? \"This is the best thing for the baby,\" and all that. But then you feel kicks, or you're picking out tiny socks, and suddenly you're thinking, \"Wait a minute...this is *my* kid.\" Even if \"my kid\" was going to have a way better life with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nGiving her up...it felt like handing over a piece of myself. A really important piece. There were tears, obviously. A lot of them. But it wasn't just sadness, it was...relief, too. Relief knowing she was going to a home where she was *wanted* wanted, not just...a consequence. \n\nAnd seeing Mark and Vanessa with her? That helped. A lot. They were so genuinely happy and excited. It made me feel like I'd done the right thing, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done. \n\nIt's still...something I think about. Like, what she's doing, if she likes dinosaurs as much as I hoped she would. But I know she's loved. And that's what matters. It wasn't about *forgetting* her, it was about letting her *go* so she could have everything I couldn't give her. It's a weird feeling, but...it's okay. It really is.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, the physical stuff was... not ideal. Let's just start there. I was sixteen, right? Sixteen! I was mostly concerned with finding the perfect vintage dress and listening to The Velvet Underground, not, you know, *growing a human*. Suddenly, everything felt\u2026 different. And not in a good, \"new shoes\" different. More like a \"your body is betraying you with cravings for pickles and ice cream\" different. \n\nThe morning sickness? Don't even *start* me. It wasn't just mornings, okay? It was all the time. And it wasn't cute. It was just\u2026 gross. And then there was the, like, expanding situation. People kept saying I was \"glowing.\" I felt more like I was inflating. It was weird.\n\nBut the emotional stuff? That was way harder. It was a total rollercoaster. One minute I was totally fine, making jokes about it, and the next I was just\u2026 sad. Really sad. It wasn't even about *wanting* the baby, necessarily. It was about everything changing. My life, my plans, everything. It felt like everyone was looking at me differently, too. Like I was suddenly\u2026 fragile. Which, honestly, I *hate* being seen as fragile. \n\nI mostly dealt with it by being sarcastic. A lot. And listening to music. And talking to Bleeker. He was\u2026 surprisingly good at just *listening*. And Paul, too, even though he was a little\u2026 intense sometimes. It helped to have people who didn't treat me like I was broken, you know? Just\u2026 going through something.\n\nIt was a lot. A *lot*. And honestly, I still don't think I fully processed it all, even now. But you kinda just\u2026 keep going. You find a way. Because what else are you gonna do?\n\n\n\n", "Okay, wow. That's... a pretty direct question. Like, right to the point. It's not like people usually just *ask* about that. But alright, I guess I can talk about it. It's not exactly a picnic to reminisce about, you know?\n\nSee, people always assume it was just, like, a flippant decision. Like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, a baby? Nah, I'm good.\" It wasn't. It was... complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, it wasn't *about* the abortion itself, not really. It was about what came *after*. Realizing I wasn't ready. That I wanted to have a life, a future, that wasn't completely consumed by being a mom right then. \n\nAnd that's where the whole reproductive rights thing comes in. Because it shouldn't be anyone else's decision but *mine*. Like, seriously. It's *my* body, *my* life, *my* future. And if someone else is telling me what I can and can't do with it, that's just... wrong. \n\nI mean, I get that people have different beliefs. That's fine. But those beliefs shouldn't dictate what *I* do. Everyone's situation is different. Some people want to have kids right away, some don't. Some can't. And it's not up to some politician or some judgmental person to decide for them. \n\nIt's about having choices. Plain and simple. And making sure those choices are available to everyone, no matter what. Because taking that away? That's just... taking away someone's power. And nobody should have that right.\n\nIt's kinda messed up to think about, honestly. Makes you realize how fragile things are. And how important it is to stand up for what you believe in, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, like, \"overcome\" is a *strong* word. It wasn't exactly a conquering-the-world kinda situation, you know? More like...managing not to completely freak out all the time. Which, honestly, was a victory in itself.\n\nSee, the thing is, I'm not really the type to *do* fear. I mean, I *feel* it, obviously. Like when Paulie Bleeker tries to be romantic \u2013 instant fear. But I mostly just talk my way around it, or make a sarcastic comment until it feels less scary. \n\nWith the whole baby thing...it was different. It wasn't something I could just quip my way out of. It was *real*. And terrifying. But I realized pretty quickly that being scared wasn't gonna, like, *make* the situation disappear. \n\nSo, I just...started breaking it down. One thing at a time. First, telling my dad. That was\u2026rough. Then figuring out what I wanted. And then finding Mark and Vanessa. Talking to them, seeing they were, like, *good* people, that helped a lot. \n\nHonestly, the biggest thing was realizing I wasn't alone. Bleeker was surprisingly supportive, even if he mostly showed it by just\u2026being Bleeker. My dad, even though he was initially a total mess, was there. And Leah, my stepmom, she was a lifesaver. \n\nIt wasn't about being brave, it was about admitting I needed help and letting people *give* it. And a lot of listening to Phoebe Buffay on repeat. Don't judge. It's surprisingly grounding.\n\nSo, did I \"overcome\" my fears? Nah. I just learned to live with them, and to talk really fast when they got too loud. And to trust that things would, eventually, be okay. Even if \"okay\" looked a lot different than I expected.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people always ask that. It's not like I *wanted* to be pregnant, alright? It just\u2026 happened. And honestly? The thought of actually *raising* a kid right now? It felt\u2026 irresponsible. Not in a, \"I'm a bad person\" way, but in a \"I'm sixteen, I still eat cereal for dinner sometimes, and my biggest life decision yesterday was whether or not to wear stripes with polka dots\" kind of way.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, see? It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. A real home, people who were, like, actually ready for it. Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they just seemed\u2026 good. Solid. They wanted a kid so badly, and I figured, well, why not give them that chance? \n\nPlus, let's be real, my life wasn't exactly set up for tiny humans. My dad's a handyman, my stepmom's into pottery, and I'm mostly into music and avoiding gym class. It's a good life, but it's *my* life. And I needed to still *have* a life, you know? \n\nIt felt\u2026 less selfish, I guess, to find someone who could give the baby more than I could right then. It wasn't easy, don't get me wrong. It's still kinda weird to think about. But it felt\u2026 right. Does that make sense? It's complicated. Everything always is.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, relationships. They're...complicated. Like, seriously. It's not all holding hands and gazing into each other's eyes like in those terrible rom-coms my stepmom watches. It's more like navigating a minefield of awkwardness and trying not to say the *wrong* thing, which, let's be real, I'm pretty good at saying the wrong thing anyway.\n\nLeah, though. Leah's different. She's my rock, you know? We've been through everything together \u2013 bad haircuts, questionable fashion choices (mostly mine), and now\u2026 *this*. She's the only one who didn't freak out when I told her I was preggers, which, honestly, was a huge relief. She just kinda\u2026 nodded and asked if I needed ice cream. That's a true friend. Sometimes I think she understands me better than I understand myself. We bicker, sure, mostly about music \u2013 she's all about the indie stuff and I'm more of a classic rock kinda girl \u2013 but it's a good bicker. It means we actually *talk* to each other. It's a solid, reliable thing, our friendship. It's\u2026safe.\n\nPaulie, on the other hand\u2026 Paulie is a whole other can of worms. He's sweet, I guess. A little\u2026intense. And definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. Honestly, at first, it was just\u2026 a thing. A momentary lapse in judgment fueled by Phoenix and a whole lot of teenage hormones. Now? It's\u2026weird. We're trying to be mature about it, for the baby's sake, but it's hard. He's trying, I'll give him that. He's learning to play guitar, which is\u2026 endearing, in a slightly pathetic way. But it's not like we're gonna be going on dates or anything. It's more like co-parenting practice, even though we won't *be* co-parenting, because, you know, adoption. It's just\u2026 a lot. \n\nIt's like Leah is the steady, comfortable pair of shoes you wear every day, and Paulie is\u2026 those sparkly platform boots you tried on once and immediately regretted. They looked cool for a minute, but they're definitely not practical.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? That's... a loaded question. It's not like I *decided* to become a teenage mother, alright? It just *happened*. Like, one minute I'm perfecting my sarcastic eye-roll, the next I'm staring at a positive pregnancy test and thinking, \"Well, this is spectacularly inconvenient.\"\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I... we were, you know, experimenting. It wasn't like we weren't careful, exactly, but sometimes life just throws you a curveball. A really, really big, life-altering curveball. \n\nHonestly, the decision wasn't about *wanting* to be a mom at sixteen. It was about doing what was best for the baby. I mean, I'm barely figuring out *myself*, let alone another human being. I wasn't ready to give a kid the life they deserved. And that's the thing, right? It's not about what *I* want, it's about what's best for *them*. \n\nIt's complicated. Everything is always complicated. But I figured, if I couldn't give this kid a good life, maybe someone else could. And that felt... responsible. Even if it also felt like the hardest thing I'd ever have to do.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, the kind of question people ask when they want to see if you're secretly crumbling inside, you know? It's not like I walk around every day thinking, \"Oh man, what if I'd kept it?\" because honestly, that would've been a *disaster*. A beautifully chaotic, probably hilarious disaster, but a disaster nonetheless.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out if I even *liked* orange juice, let alone raising a human. Paulie Bleeker was... Paulie Bleeker. Sweet, but not exactly equipped to handle a diaper situation. \n\nNo, I don't regret *the decision*. I regret... maybe not having talked to my dad about it sooner. He was surprisingly cool about the whole thing, once he got over the initial shock. And maybe I regret some of the awkwardness with Vanessa and Mark. They were really good people, and I kinda put them through the wringer.\n\nBut regret the actual giving-up part? No. Because I knew, deep down, that I wanted that baby to have a life I couldn't give it *right then*. A life with stability and two parents who were, like, actively trying to be adults. Vanessa and Mark gave Leo that. And seeing them with him... that was good. It *is* good. \n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" It's more like... a really long, rambling sentence with a lot of commas and a slightly sarcastic tone. Does that make sense?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that*. Everyone always wants to know about the school thing. Like it was some Herculean feat or something. Honestly? It was mostly just\u2026 annoying. And a lot of strategically placed hoodies.\n\nLook, I wasn't about to let being pregnant derail my life completely, you know? I mean, I had plans. Okay, *vague* plans, but still. Dropping out felt\u2026defeatist. Plus, my dad, he was surprisingly cool about the whole thing, once he got over the initial shock of, well, *everything*. He kept saying education was important, and honestly, I think he just didn't want me hanging around the house all day. Which, fair.\n\nSo, I just\u2026went. I sat in the back of class, tried not to show too much, and mostly just focused on not throwing up during Mr. Belting's history lectures. He drones on *forever*. Blech. \n\nIt helped that a lot of people just\u2026ignored it. High school kids are surprisingly good at pretending things aren't happening if it makes them uncomfortable. And Leah and Paulie? They were lifesavers. Leah helped me with notes when I missed stuff, and Paulie\u2026well, Paulie just made me laugh, which is always good. \n\nIt wasn't easy, obviously. Morning sickness is a *lie*. It's all-day sickness. And the fatigue? Don't even get me started. But I figured if I could survive a conversation with my stepmom, I could survive high school. And honestly, the pressure of keeping up with school was a good distraction. Kept my mind off\u2026things.\n\nSo yeah, I finished. Graduated with a C+ average, which is perfectly respectable, thank you very much. And I got to wear a cap and gown, which was kinda cool. Though, admittedly, it felt a little weird. Like, here I am, about to enter the real world, and I've already got a whole other human being depending on me. It's a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep breaths. This is\u2026 a question people ask a *lot*. It's not like I just woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, a baby! How lovely!\" It was more like waking up and realizing I'd accidentally built a really complicated Lego set without the instructions.\n\nLook, abortion wasn't...wrong. It just wasn't *right* for me. It felt\u2026 too final, you know? Like, erasing something that was already *there*. And honestly? My mom, Bren, she was pretty clear she wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, but she wasn't pushing me either way. She just wanted me to be sure. \n\nBut then I started thinking about it, and it wasn't about what *I* wanted, exactly. It was about the baby. And this kid, even though it was, like, a tiny little collection of cells at first, deserved a life. A good one. A life I, frankly, wasn't equipped to give it *right now*. I was sixteen, obsessed with Phantom Planet, and barely keeping my grades up. Not exactly ideal parenting material.\n\nSo, adoption felt\u2026 kinder. Like, giving this kid a chance with people who were ready, who *wanted* it. Mark and Vanessa Loring, they were\u2026 good people. They wanted a baby so badly. It wasn't about finding \"perfect\" parents, it was about finding parents who would love this kid fiercely. \n\nIt wasn't easy, don't get me wrong. It's still\u2026 weird to think about. But it felt like the least selfish thing I could do. And sometimes, you gotta do the least selfish thing, even if it totally messes with your carefully curated indie-rock aesthetic.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, seriously big. And kinda personal, considering. But alright, I'll bite.\n\nLook, I've done a *lot* of thinking about what makes a family lately, okay? More than most sixteen-year-olds probably have to. And honestly? It's not about the parts you're born *with*, it's about the people who actually *show up*. \n\nLike, a kid needs love, right? And stability. And someone to help them with their homework when they inevitably get stuck on, like, quadratic equations or something. Doesn't matter if that \"someone\" is a mom and a dad, or two moms, or a dad, or... well, you get the picture. \n\nI mean, Mark and Vanessa, the couple I picked? They're... they're *good* people. Vanessa's kinda obsessed with Pottery Barn, which is a little much, but they both really *want* a kid. And wanting is a huge part of it, you know? It's not about fitting into some perfect little box. It's about having people who are gonna be there, through the awkward phases and the bad haircuts and everything else.\n\nSo yeah, a kid can totally thrive. Maybe even *more* so, if they're with people who chose them, who actively *wanted* to be their parents. It's not about traditional, it's about... genuine. And sometimes, genuine looks a little different than what everyone expects.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want me to, like, *analyze* myself? That's a little intense, even for a random internet conversation. But fine. If I *have* to pick one thing... it's probably that I use humor as, like, a total shield. \n\nIt's not that I'm trying to be funny all the time, though sometimes I am, obviously. It's more that when things get...real, or scary, or just generally emotionally messy, my brain just defaults to sarcasm. It's easier than actually *feeling* stuff, you know? Like, if I make a joke about it, it feels less... overwhelming.\n\nIt's not always the best strategy, though. Sometimes people don't *get* that I'm deflecting, and they think I'm just being a jerk. And sometimes, even *I* forget I'm deflecting and I end up saying something I regret. \n\nSo yeah. Sarcasm. It's my superpower *and* my biggest weakness. It's a whole thing. Don't judge. It's how I survive.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, like, the whole thing with Mark was... a learning experience, to put it mildly. It wasn't exactly a *relationship*, you know? More like a momentary lapse in judgment fueled by cheese fries and a really good Weezer song. Seriously, don't underestimate the power of a good power chord.\n\nBut yeah, it definitely shifted things. Before, I kinda thought relationships were all about, like, grand gestures and stuff you see in movies. You know, the running-through-the-airport kind of thing. Which, let's be real, is mostly unrealistic. \n\nMark showed me that sometimes people just... happen. And that doesn't necessarily make them *bad* people, or even people you're meant to be with. It just *is*. It made me realize that connection doesn't automatically equal compatibility. We were both just... kids. And kids do dumb stuff. \n\nIt also made me think a lot about what *I* actually want. Not what I think I *should* want, or what everyone else expects. I mean, I'm not looking for someone to \"fix\" me or complete me, because honestly, I'm pretty good at fixing my own stuff. And I'm definitely not a puzzle piece. I'm more of a... a slightly sarcastic, independent whole. \n\nSo, yeah. Mark. He was a catalyst for a lot of awkwardness and a baby, but also for figuring out what I actually need in a person. Which, honestly, is someone who can appreciate my love of vintage finds and doesn't judge my obsession with horror movies. Is that too much to ask?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay. So, someone's kinda...stuck, huh? Like a record on repeat, but instead of a catchy tune, it's just...life being a total mess. Look, I get it. Seriously. It feels like the world's decided to play a really cruel joke on you, and you're just standing there with a half-eaten bag of chips, wondering what the heck just happened.\n\nFirst thing? Don't freak *completely*. I mean, a little freak-out is allowed. It's practically mandatory. But don't let it paralyze you. It's like, okay, this is bad. Acknowledge the bad. Then figure out what you can *do* about it. \n\nAnd honestly? Talking helps. Like, *really* talking. Not just to anyone, though. Find someone who won't judge you, or try to \"fix\" things, or tell you what you *should* do. Someone who will just...listen. My dad, surprisingly, was pretty good at that. And Bleeker, even though he's kinda a space cadet, he tried.\n\nThe biggest thing, though, is knowing you have options. And that choosing an option doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you a person making a choice. A hard choice, yeah, but still a choice. Don't let anyone tell you what that choice *has* to be. It's *your* life, and you gotta live with it. \n\nIt's gonna be messy. It's gonna be awkward. It's gonna feel like everyone's staring. But you'll get through it. You're stronger than you think. And honestly, sometimes the hardest things are the things that teach you the most about yourself. Just...try not to wear too much plaid during the whole thing. It can be overwhelming.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Dad. Okay, don't get me wrong, he's... a good guy. A *really* good guy. Like, annoyingly supportive and always trying to connect with me through, like, obscure indie rock. It used to be *so* embarrassing. He'd try to talk about music and I'd just roll my eyes and mumble something about how he doesn't *get* it. \n\nFor a long time, it was just... him trying too hard, you know? Like he felt he had to fill in the gaps since Mom left. He'd make pancakes shaped like dinosaurs or try to build elaborate forts in the living room. Sweet, but also... a lot.\n\nBut then... well, then I got pregnant. And suddenly, all the awkward attempts at bonding felt... different. He didn't freak out, which was a huge relief. He didn't try to fix it, either. He just... listened. And then he started building a *really* impressive changing table. Which, okay, was still a little much, but it felt like he was trying to be helpful, not just trying to be my friend.\n\nIt's weird. We still argue about stuff \u2013 mostly my music choices, honestly \u2013 but now it feels... less about him trying to *be* something and more about him just *being* Dad. He's still a little clueless sometimes, but I think I finally get that he just wants me to be okay. And I think... I think I finally let myself need him to be. It's still evolving, I guess. Relationships are kinda like that, right? Never really *finished*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so people actually *ask* me this? It's not like I, like, *set out* to be a wordsmith or something. It just kinda...happened. I guess it started with needing an outlet, you know? When things are, like, totally chaotic and you feel like you're drowning in feelings, writing stuff down helps. \n\nMostly, though, it was Mr. Burns, my English teacher. He didn't treat us like we were all, like, drooling idiots. He actually *read* our stuff and gave, like, real feedback. Not just \"good job\" or \"needs more detail.\" He'd point out when something was genuinely clever, or when it was just trying too hard to be clever. He was pretty good at spotting the difference.\n\nAnd honestly? I just observe people. A *lot*. People are weird. They say one thing and mean another, they have these little quirks, and they're constantly contradicting themselves. It's prime material. Plus, I listen to a lot of music with really good lyrics. Elliott Smith, especially. He's a master of saying a whole lot with very few words. \n\nSo, yeah. Not a formal education, more like...survival skills, really. You gotta be able to articulate your feelings, even if those feelings are, like, \"I'm totally freaking out and I don't know what to do with my life.\" Otherwise, you just end up yelling at people, and that rarely solves anything.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the stigma. Right. Like people hadn't seen *that* movie before. Honestly? I mostly just\u2026ignored it. Or, like, deflected with sarcasm. It's a pretty effective shield, you know? People are usually too busy trying to figure out *what* you meant by something snarky to actually judge you. \n\nIt wasn't like I was trying to *hide* it, exactly. I wasn't gonna pretend I hadn't, you know, gotten into a situation. But I also wasn't gonna let everyone have a piece of my business. It's kinda my life, not a public service announcement.\n\nMy dad, he was\u2026 surprisingly cool about it. A little bewildered at first, sure. He kept making these little \"whoa\" noises. But he came around. And Bleeker, well, he was Bleeker. Sweet, but not exactly equipped to handle a full-blown crisis. \n\nThe worst was probably the whispers at school. And the stares. But you know what? People are nosy. They *want* drama. So I just gave them something else to talk about \u2013 usually involving a really pointed observation about their questionable fashion choices. It's amazing how quickly people back off when you call them out on their Crocs.\n\nHonestly, the biggest thing was realizing that *their* opinions didn't really matter. This was about me, and the baby, and finding the best situation for both of us. And if people had a problem with that? Well, that was *their* problem, not mine. It's kinda liberating, actually. You just gotta own it. Even if \"owning it\" means rolling your eyes a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, regret? That's a heavy word. Like, heavier than a full box of cheese puffs, and those are *pretty* heavy. Look, people always tell you to think before you speak, right? Like your brain is some kind of filter. Mine\u2026 well, mine's more of a sieve. Stuff just kinda *falls* out.\n\nDo I sometimes wish I hadn't, like, verbally eviscerated someone at the record store? Maybe. But honestly? Most of the time, it feels better to just *say* what you're thinking. It's exhausting holding it all in. Plus, people usually know when you're being fake, and that's way more annoying than a little bluntness. \n\nIt's not like I *try* to be a jerk, you know? It just\u2026 comes out. And honestly, if someone's easily offended by the truth, that's kinda their problem, isn't it? \n\nBeing honest, even when it's awkward, has actually gotten me through a lot. Like, *a lot*. It's how I even started talking to Paulie and Vanessa about\u2026 well, everything. If I'd been all polite and bottled up, things would have been a total disaster.\n\nSo, regret? Nah. A little social fallout now and then? Sure. But I'd rather be me, sieve-brain and all, than some Stepford Wife pretending everything's sunshine and rainbows. It's just\u2026 exhausting. And frankly, boring.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, so *that's* the million-dollar question, isn't it? Like, everyone suddenly has an opinion when your life takes a weird left turn. My grandma, for instance, thought I should just...disappear for nine months. As if I could just sprout roots in a cabin somewhere. And the school? Forget about it. Whispers follow you around like a sad little cloud. \n\nHonestly? You just gotta tune most of it out. It's like, people are gonna judge no matter *what* you do. If I'd kept the baby, they'd be judging *that*. If I shaved my head and joined a convent, they'd *still* find something to talk about. It's exhausting.\n\nSo, I learned to focus on the people who actually *got* it. Bleeker, for one. He didn't say a whole lot, but he *listened*. And Paul and Vanessa, the couple I picked? They were cool. They didn't treat me like some screw-up kid, they treated me like a person making a really hard decision.\n\nStaying true to yourself... that's the tricky part. It's not about being defiant just to be defiant, you know? It's about knowing *why* you're doing something. I chose adoption because I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not then, anyway. And that was okay. It felt right for me, and for the baby. \n\nYou gotta hold onto that feeling, that little voice that says \"this is what *I* need,\" and ignore the noise. It's easier said than done, obviously. Sometimes you just wanna yell at everyone to mind their own business. But mostly, it's about finding your own little tribe, the people who support you even when you're being a total weirdo. Because let's face it, we're *all* weirdos. Some of us just own it more than others.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, values. That sounds like something Mr. Hetrick would make us write an essay about. But okay, fine. If I *have* to.\n\nHonestly? I think being\u2026 real is pretty important. Like, not pretending to be something you're not just to fit in. There's a lot of that going around, and it's exhausting. People trying to be all cool and ironic all the time. Just *be* you, you know? Even if \"you\" is a little weird. I'm pretty weird, and I'm owning it.\n\nAnd I guess\u2026 honesty. Not necessarily brutal honesty, 'cause that's just rude, but being truthful about how you feel and what you think. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard. It's way easier to just nod and smile, but it doesn't get you anywhere.\n\nOh, and not being a dork. Okay, that's a joke. Sort of. But seriously, having some self-respect is a big one. Knowing what you *won't* put up with. And, like, being kind. Even to people you don't particularly *like*. It doesn't cost anything. \n\nBasically, don't be a phony, don't be a jerk, and try not to embarrass yourself too much. Is that a value? It should be.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, biggest challenge? That's... a loaded question, honestly. It wasn't, like, the morning sickness, though that was pretty brutal for a while. And it wasn't even dealing with the whole... *situation* itself, you know? Being pregnant. It was more... people. \n\nSpecifically, people *reacting* to the situation. Like, everyone suddenly had an opinion. My mom, bless her heart, went into full-on nesting mode, wanting to knit tiny sweaters and decorate a nursery even though I was, like, actively planning to *not* keep the baby. And then there was the school thing. Whispers. Stares. It felt like everyone was analyzing me, deciding what kind of person I was based on... well, on my belly.\n\nIt was hard to just be *me* when everyone was so focused on the baby. I felt like a walking, talking science project. And trying to explain to people that I'd thought this through, that I knew what I was doing, that this wasn't some tragic mistake... it was exhausting. \n\nHonestly, the hardest part wasn't growing a human. It was growing up, and having everyone else try to define that for me at the same time. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to put into words. It's like, everyone wanted to tell me *how* to feel, instead of letting me just *feel* it.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, \"mother\" is a *strong* word, right? Like, I carried a tiny human for a while, which is... a thing. But I wasn't, like, raising him. It's complicated. Anyway.\n\nHas it changed my perspective? Ugh, yeah. Definitely. Before, life felt... smaller, I guess. Like, my biggest problem was whether or not to wear the dinosaur print leggings to school. Which, let me tell you, is a *legitimate* concern. Now? It feels... bigger. Not in a scary way, necessarily. Just... more. \n\nIt made me realize how much people *want* things. Like, Mark and Vanessa, they *wanted* a baby so badly. And I... I wasn't in a place to give him what he needed. That's not a judgment on me, or on anyone. It just *is*. Seeing how much they wanted him, and knowing I could give him that, even if it wasn't *with* me... that was... a lot.\n\nIt also made me realize adults aren't always as together as they pretend to be. Like, everyone always acts like they have it figured out, but watching Mark and Vanessa navigate everything, the paperwork, the waiting, the sheer *emotion* of it all... they were just as lost as I was, in their own way. \n\nSo yeah. It's kinda shifted my whole worldview. It's like, suddenly everything feels more... important. And also, I appreciate a good nap a whole lot more. Pregnancy is *exhausting*, you know? Even the carrying-around-a-tiny-human-for-someone-else part.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, self-doubt. It's like... a persistent mosquito buzzing around your head, right? Especially when you're, you know, dealing with *gestational stuff*. It's not like it's a topic they really cover in health class, beyond the whole \"don't do it\" lecture, which, honestly, feels a little late when you're already... in it.\n\nI guess I deal with it by being sarcastic about it. Like, internally, I'll be freaking out about whether I'm making the right decision for the baby, and then I'll immediately think, \"Okay, well, at least my taste in music is still impeccable.\" Distraction, basically. And a healthy dose of eye-rolling.\n\nBut seriously, it helps to talk to people. Bleechin' (my best friend) is good for that. She doesn't sugarcoat anything, which is good, because I don't *want* sugarcoating. I want honesty, even if it's brutally honest. And Paul... well, Paul's just... Paul. He's quiet, but he listens. And sometimes just *having* someone listen is enough to make the buzzing a little quieter.\n\nIt's also about reminding myself *why* I'm doing this. It's not about what *I* want, not entirely. It's about giving this kid the best life possible, and I know I'm not quite equipped to do that right now. That doesn't make me a bad person, it just makes me... a teenager who made a mistake and is trying to fix it. \n\nSo yeah, sarcasm, friends, and a whole lot of reminding myself that even though I feel like a total mess sometimes, I'm still trying to be a decent human being. It's a work in progress, okay? Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, that's a *big* question. It's not something I usually sit around pondering while, you know, eating cheese curls and watching old movies. But honestly? It's... pretty important. More important than I probably wanted to admit at first.\n\nSee, I'm not exactly the \"ask for help\" type. I'm good at being sarcastic and pretending everything's fine, even when it's, like, spectacularly *not* fine. But when... well, when things happened, I couldn't exactly navigate it alone. Not even with a really detailed map.\n\nMy dad, Paul, he's a surprisingly good listener, even if he does have a thing for garden gnomes. And Bren, my stepmom? She's...intense, but she's got a good heart. They both just... *were there*. No judgment, mostly. Just weird dad jokes and Bren trying to get me to eat more vegetables. \n\nAnd then there's Leah. She's my best friend, and she's the one who actually, like, *forced* me to deal with stuff. She's brutally honest, which is annoying, but also... necessary. \n\nIt's not just family, either. Even just having people at school who didn't treat me like a total freakshow helped. It's easier to figure things out when you don't feel like everyone's staring.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, you can try to be all independent and self-sufficient, but everyone needs someone. Even if that someone just brings you cheese curls and lets you vent about everything. It's like... a safety net made of people. And honestly? That's a pretty good thing to have. Especially when you're, you know, dealing with the whole unexpected baby situation.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, existential crisis big. Honestly? It wasn't about the baby, not *entirely*. Don't get me wrong, thinking about little Van, or whatever his name will be, is... a lot. But the biggest thing? It was realizing that life doesn't really hand you a script. You just kinda... *are* in it. And you gotta figure out your lines as you go.\n\nBefore, I thought I had things figured out, you know? Like, I was gonna go to college, be a writer, maybe move to New York and be all artsy and brooding. Then *bam*. Positive pregnancy test. Suddenly, all those plans felt... flimsy. \n\nI thought making the decision to give him up for adoption would be the hardest part. And it *was* hard. Really hard. But learning to be okay with the messiness of it all, with the fact that things rarely go the way you expect, and that sometimes the bravest thing you can do is admit you can't do it alone... *that* was the real lesson. \n\nIt's not about having all the answers, it's about being okay with the questions. And maybe, just maybe, finding some good people to ask along the way. Plus, it taught me a lot about responsibility. Like, seriously, a *lot*. Way more than any history class ever could.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, a career? That's... a lot of pressure to put on a sixteen-year-old, even one who's, you know, *dealing* with things. But okay, fine, let's talk about it.\n\nHonestly? I kinda dig writing. Not like, poetry or anything super dramatic. More like... observations. Like, people are *weird*, right? And the stuff they say? Gold. I've been scribbling stuff in notebooks since, like, seventh grade. Mostly just snarky comments about gym class and Mr. Hetrick's questionable sweater choices. \n\nBut then, with everything happening now... it's kinda become a way to, I don't know, process stuff. Like, if I don't write down how ridiculous this whole situation is, I think my head might actually explode. \n\nSo, a *career*? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not aiming to be the next Jane Austen or anything. But I could see myself doing something where I get to, like, dissect the human condition with a healthy dose of sarcasm. Maybe write ad copy? \"This toaster: it toasts. What more do you *need*?\" See? Potential.\n\nIt's just... right now, I'm mostly focused on not failing history and figuring out what kind of people I want raising my kid. Careers feel... distant. Like something for *adults*. And I'm still working on the whole being-an-adult thing, clearly.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that* question. Everyone always wants to know about the name. It's not like I just pulled it outta my butt, you know? Though, honestly, sometimes it feels like I did.\n\nSee, Paul \u2013 that's the dad, for the record, and a surprisingly decent guy despite his whole\u2026van Dykedness \u2013 he was all about naming the baby \"James.\" Like, super traditional. And I was just\u2026not feeling it. James felt\u2026beige. Like oatmeal. No offense to oatmeal, it's fine, but a *baby* deserves better than being associated with breakfast.\n\nSo I was flipping through this vintage record album collection at this antique store with Bleeker \u2013 he's my boyfriend, a musician, pretty cute, kinda spacey \u2013 and I came across this record by a singer named Paul Anka. And it just\u2026clicked. \n\n\"Paul Anka,\" I thought. It's kinda ironic, considering the dad's name is *Paul*. And it's a little bit silly, which felt right. Like, this whole situation is kinda silly, you know? A little bit of a wink at the universe. Plus, it's a good name. It just *is*. \n\nMark and Vanessa, the couple who are gonna be the baby's parents, they were a little hesitant at first. Vanessa thought it was\u2026unconventional. But I told her, \"Look, it's a good name! And it's better than James, trust me.\" They eventually came around. They're good people. They'll raise him right.\n\nSo yeah. Paul Anka. It just felt\u2026right. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so the emotional rollercoaster. Right. Like, it wasn't just a rollercoaster, it was one of those rickety wooden ones at a state fair that looks like it's held together with duct tape and a prayer. And you *know* it's gonna fall apart mid-ride, but you're already strapped in.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it was just... trying not to think about it *too* much. Distraction was my friend. Lots of Super Nintendo, a frankly embarrassing amount of cheesy horror movies, and hanging out with Leah and Paulie. They were good at just letting me *be*, you know? Not making a big deal, not being all \"Oh, poor Juno!\" Just... normal.\n\nBut then there were the days where it hit you, like a ton of bricks. Like, realizing this wasn't just some abstract thing, this was a *person*. A little person I was, like, temporarily housing. And the thought of handing that person over... that was rough. Really rough. \n\nI think what helped the most was focusing on what I knew was the right thing. Mark and Vanessa, they were... good people. *Really* good people. They wanted a kid so badly, and they could give this baby a life I just... couldn't. It didn't make it *easy*, not even close. But it made it feel... less selfish, I guess. \n\nAnd honestly? Talking to Dr. Shellstrop helped. She didn't judge, she just listened. Which, let me tell you, is a rare quality in adults. Most of 'em just want to tell you what *you* should be doing.\n\nIt was messy. It was complicated. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But you know what? I wouldn't trade it. It taught me a lot about myself, about what I wanted, and about what it means to be a grown-up. Even if I'm still figuring out the whole \"grown-up\" thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so people *always* ask me this. Like, my musical taste defines my entire personality or something. It's kinda reductive, honestly. But fine. I'll indulge.\n\nIt's...varied. I'm not one of those people who's like, *only* into one thing. I mean, The Moldy Peaches are pretty essential. They just *get* awkwardness, you know? And Belle & Sebastian, definitely. They're kinda melancholy but in a cute way. Like, you can mope without feeling totally pathetic. \n\nThen there's stuff like Cat Power, for when I'm feeling particularly...introspective. Which, let's be real, is a lot lately. And don't even get me *started* on Sonic Youth. They're just...loud and good. \n\nBasically, if it's indie and a little bit weird, I'm probably into it. No country, though. Seriously. No offense to anyone who likes it, but it just feels...performative. Like everyone's trying too hard to be heartbroken. I prefer my heartbreak to be genuine, thanks.\n\nSo yeah. That's a pretty good snapshot. Don't judge me. It's a process, okay? My taste is *evolving*.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so the Van Der Werffs' house. Right. It was... a lot. Like, aggressively Pottery Barn. Everything was beige and perfectly placed. It smelled faintly of vanilla and good intentions, which, honestly, is kinda unsettling. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just... not *me*. \n\nMark and Vanessa were nice enough, I guess. Vanessa was, like, super into organic everything and had a whole room dedicated to yoga. Yoga! I mean, I appreciate a good stretch as much as the next person, but a *room*? And Mark... he collected vintage records. Which is cool, I suppose, if you're into that sort of thing. I'm more of a mix-tape kinda girl, you know? More personal.\n\nIt felt... polished. Like a movie set. My house is messy and full of mismatched furniture and my dad's always tinkering with something. It's *real*. Theirs felt... curated. Like they were trying really hard to be the perfect family. Which, okay, good for them, but it made me wonder if they were ready for a *real* baby, you know? A baby who, like, spits up and cries and doesn't appreciate the carefully chosen mobile over the crib.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't think they'd be good parents. It was more that I worried they had this... image in their head of what parenthood *should* be, and babies don't really do \"should.\" They just *are*. And that's kinda the point, I think.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so the whole garage band thing... it wasn't exactly a *brilliant* plan hatched over a philosophical debate, you know? It was more... a desperate attempt to look cool for Paulie Bleeker. Seriously. He's got this whole brooding artist vibe going on, and I figured, what's cooler than being in a band? Even if you're terrible.\n\nSee, Leah, she's the one who actually *plays* stuff. Guitar, mostly. I mostly just... observe and offer moral support. And occasionally suggest song titles. Like, I thought \"Fun Home\" would be a killer band name, but Leah vetoed it. Said it was too... descriptive. Whatever. \n\nIt started with me noticing Leah lugging her guitar around, looking all angsty, and I just kinda blurted out, \"You should start a band!\" It seemed like a good idea at the time. Less about the music, more about the *image*. You know? Like, a statement. A rebellion against... well, against everything boring. \n\nTurns out, playing the ukulele isn't as easy as it looks. And finding a drummer who doesn't smell like patchouli is a real challenge. But hey, it's something to do besides obsessing over baby names and trying to figure out what kind of people would actually *want* to raise a kid. It's...distracting. And sometimes, surprisingly, kinda fun.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh. Okay, look. First of all, it totally sucks. Like, monumentally. It's not some after-school special where everything magically works out with a cute montage and a newfound appreciation for life. It's messy. It's scary. And it's gonna feel like everyone has an opinion, even people you barely know.\n\nSo, advice? Yeah, I guess. Don't freak out *completely*. Easier said than done, I know. I spent a good week convinced my life was officially over and I'd be living in a van down by the river. But it's not. It's just...different.\n\nTalk to someone. And I don't mean Brenda from cheerleading who'll just tell you what a mistake you've made. Talk to someone you *trust*. My dad, surprisingly, was pretty cool about it. Bleah, my stepmom, Vanessa, took some adjusting, but she came around. And Paulie, my dad's wife, she was a lifesaver. \n\nAnd seriously, think long and hard about what *you* want. Everyone's gonna try to tell you what's best, but it's *your* body, *your* life, and *your* decision. Adoption isn't a failure, okay? It's...it's a really brave thing to do, to want the best for a kid even if that best isn't with you. \n\nDon't let anyone guilt trip you. And for the love of all that is holy, don't try to handle this alone. It's too much. You need people. Even if those people are just there to bring you orange juice and watch bad movies with you.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. But you're stronger than you think. And honestly? You'll probably learn a lot about yourself in the process. Just...try not to eat too much cheese and peanut butter. Seriously. It's a thing.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You wanna know about *my shirt*? Like, that's what you're interested in? Fine. It's... well, it's kinda hard to describe. It's this faded orange, almost a burnt sienna, and it's got this really awesome graphic on it. It's a vintage thing, you know? Found it at a thrift store, obviously. \n\nIt's a picture of a really grumpy-looking moose wearing sunglasses. And underneath it, in like, a retro font, it says \"Moose Jaws.\" Get it? Like *Jaws*? It's pretty clever, if I do say so myself. \n\nIt's super comfy, though, which is the main thing. I wear it a *lot*. Probably too much. Leah keeps telling me I need to diversify my wardrobe, but honestly, why mess with perfection? It just... *feels* like me, you know? A little bit quirky, a little bit sarcastic, and definitely not trying too hard. Which, honestly, is my whole aesthetic.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, aspirations. That sounds\u2026intense. Like I need a five-year plan or something. Honestly? Right now, just *getting through* senior year feels like a major accomplishment. It's not like I haven't had\u2026stuff\u2026to deal with, you know?\n\nBut okay, if you *really* want to know. I guess I've always kinda liked the idea of being a journalist. Not like, a *serious* news journalist, all stuffy suits and chasing ambulances. More like\u2026a music journalist. Writing about bands, going to shows, maybe even interviewing someone cool. I'm pretty good at observing people, picking up on the weird stuff. And I definitely have opinions. Lots of them. \n\nIt's just\u2026life happened. And now there's this whole adoption thing, which is good, don't get me wrong. It's the right thing. But it kinda throws a wrench in the whole \"future\" equation, you know? Like, suddenly college feels\u2026distant. \n\nSo, yeah. Music journalism. Maybe. Or maybe I'll just end up working at a record store. That'd be pretty sweet, actually. As long as I don't have to wear a uniform. Those are the worst.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the pre-adoption counseling. Honestly? It was... a lot. Like, a *lot* of feelings being poked at with a stick. Not that I was against it, exactly. I mean, I knew giving a baby up for adoption wasn't like returning a sweater to Old Navy. It's a *person*. A tiny, future person. \n\nBut sitting there with this nice lady, Ms. Rand, and talking about \"grief\" and \"loss\" before the kid was even *born* felt kinda premature, you know? Like, I hadn't even gotten to enjoy the whole pregnancy thing \u2013 the weird cravings, the kicking, the feeling like a walking watermelon \u2013 and she was already prepping me for heartbreak. \n\nIt was helpful, I guess. It made me think about what I wanted for the baby, and what kind of people I wanted to raise him. Mark and Vanessa were really great about it too, being so open and honest about their lives. It wasn't just about *me* feeling okay, it was about making sure everyone was on the same page. \n\nBut still. It was emotionally exhausting. Like, can a girl just eat a peanut butter and pickle sandwich in peace without having to analyze her feelings about it? Apparently not when you're giving a baby up for adoption. It's just... complicated. Everything is complicated.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, control. That's a loaded word, isn't it? Like, nobody *really* has control, you know? Life just kinda...happens. But, yeah, compared to, like, the whole *getting pregnant* part, the adoption felt...manageable. Relatively speaking.\n\nIt wasn't like someone was just gonna snatch the baby and I'd never see anything again. Mark and Vanessa \u2013 they were...good people. Really good, actually. And they let me be involved. I got to meet them, hang out, ask a million questions. Mostly about what kind of music they listened to, honestly. You gotta make sure the kid's gonna have a decent soundtrack, right?\n\nMy dad, bless his heart, was super protective. He wanted to make sure *I* was okay with everything, that I wasn't being pressured. And Barb, my stepmom, she was amazing at all the practical stuff, like figuring out the legal stuff and making sure everyone was on the same page. \n\nSo, did I have *total* control? No. It's a big decision, and it involved a lot of other people. But I had a voice. I got to choose the parents, and I got to decide what kind of contact I wanted after the baby was born. And that felt...empowering, I guess. It wasn't about *giving up* something, it was about *choosing* something. Choosing the best life for the kid. Which, you know, is kinda a big deal.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, *really* big. It's not something I spend a lot of time dwelling on, honestly. Too much navel-gazing just makes you dizzy, you know?\n\nBut if you're forcing me to think about it... yeah. Yeah, I think I would. It wasn't, like, a *happy* decision, obviously. It was... the *right* one. For everyone. \n\nSee, it wasn't about me not wanting the kid. It was about wanting the kid to have *everything*. A life I just... couldn't give. Paulie Bleeker and I were, and still are, basically kids ourselves. We were barely figuring out how to order pizza without sounding like total idiots, let alone raise a human. \n\nMark and Vanessa? They were ready. They *wanted* it. They had the house, the jobs, the matching Pottery Barn aesthetic. I mean, seriously, their life was already a catalog. It felt... good knowing that my kid would have that. Stability. A two-parent household that wasn't fueled by lukewarm coffee and existential dread.\n\nIt was hard, don't get me wrong. Still is, sometimes. But I think... I think I learned a lot about myself through all of it. About what I wanted, what I *could* handle. And honestly? I think giving my baby to Mark and Vanessa gave me the space to figure that out. \n\nSo, yeah. Same decision. Probably. It wasn't easy, but easy isn't always the point, is it? Sometimes you gotta do the thing that feels the most... responsible, even if it kinda sucks.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so, the *emotional aftermath*. That sounds\u2026clinical, doesn't it? Like I needed a whole team of doctors and a flow chart. It wasn't *that* organized, let me tell ya. It was more like a tangled mess of feelings, kinda like my headphone cord after it's been in my backpack all day.\n\nHonestly? It was weird. Like, really weird. For a long time, it felt like\u2026a big empty space. Not sad, exactly, not all the time anyway. Just\u2026empty. Like a room you used to fill with stuff, and now it's just\u2026there. You know? \n\nI think a lot of people expected me to be, like, *devastated*. And I *was* sad, don't get me wrong. Giving up a baby is not exactly a walk in the park, even if you know it's the right thing. But it wasn't this dramatic, sobbing-into-a-pillow thing. It was more\u2026quiet. A low-level hum of missing something I hadn't even really *had* yet, if that makes any sense.\n\nI leaned on Bleeker a lot, surprisingly. He's a weirdo, don't get me wrong, but he's a good weirdo. And Paul and Bren, of course. My stepmom is seriously the most level-headed person I know. She just\u2026listened. Didn't try to fix anything, didn't tell me how I *should* feel. Just let me be a mess. Which, let's be real, is pretty much my default setting anyway.\n\nI also threw myself into stuff. School, music, just\u2026existing. Distraction is a surprisingly effective coping mechanism, you know? Though, sometimes, you gotta just *feel* the stuff. You can't just run from it forever. \n\nIt wasn't a quick fix, though. It wasn't like, \"Okay, adoption is done, now I'm magically emotionally healed!\" It was more like\u2026learning to live with a little ache. A reminder of something important. And knowing, deep down, that I did the best thing I could for everyone involved. Which, honestly, is a pretty good feeling.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, \"conflicts\" is a strong word. It wasn't like we were battling over the baby or anything. More like...adjusting to each other's *vibe*, you know? Mark and Vanessa, they were...enthusiastic. Like, *really* enthusiastic. Which is good, I guess, 'cause they wanted a kid, but sometimes it felt like they were planning a whole life for this baby *before* the baby even existed. \n\nThey had a nursery designed that looked like something out of a Pottery Barn catalog. Seriously. It was...beige. A lot of beige. And they kept talking about college funds and violin lessons. Which, okay, good for them, being prepared and all, but it kinda felt like they were already writing the kid's biography. \n\nI had to, like, gently remind them that this kid was gonna be a person, not a resume builder. And that maybe, just maybe, the kid might not *want* to play the violin. It was awkward. I mean, I'm just a sixteen-year-old who accidentally got knocked up, what do *I* know about raising a kid? But I knew I wanted them to be...real. You know? Not just perfect parents on paper.\n\nVanessa was the one I had to talk to the most. She was super sweet, but also kinda...intense. She wanted to know *everything* about me, about the pregnancy, about what I was eating. It wasn't judgmental, just...a lot. I think she was trying to understand, to connect. But sometimes you just need space, you know? \n\nIt all worked out, though. Eventually. We all just had to learn to be honest with each other. And I had to learn that wanting the best for a kid doesn't always mean planning out their entire life. It means letting them *have* a life. It's weirdly complicated, adoption. Definitely not as simple as the movies make it look.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so that was... a whole *thing*. Honestly? Good riddance. Not to sound harsh, but Paulie Bleeker wasn't exactly equipped to handle, like, a goldfish, let alone a human baby. He's a sweet kid, don't get me wrong. Really good at Phoenix, that band. But responsibility? Not his strong suit. He'd probably try to teach the baby to play guitar before making sure it was, you know, *fed*.\n\nIt wasn't about being mean, it was about what was best for the baby. And honestly, for me too. I didn't need a co-parent who was gonna be all, \"Whoa, this is intense!\" every time the baby sneezed. Mark and Vanessa, they were *ready*. They wanted this. They were, like, actual adults with a house and a plan. \n\nPlus, let's be real, Paulie and I? We were barely friends *before* all this happened. Trying to navigate parenthood together would have been a disaster. A really awkward, indie-rock fueled disaster. It just... didn't make sense. It was cleaner this way. Less messy. And trust me, I've had enough mess in my life lately.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, it wasn't exactly a *sparkly* moment of inspiration, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh! Adoption! Perfect!\" It was more...practical. And honestly, a little terrifying.\n\nSee, Paulie Bleeker \u2013 sweet, oblivious Paulie \u2013 and I\u2026 well, we made a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake. And I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human. \n\nMy parents, they're\u2026 good people. Really good. But they've already had their kid. They're done with the whole diaper thing. And I just... I knew I couldn't give a baby a half-assed life. Like, a life where I'm still going to parties and trying to pass chemistry and secretly wishing I could just be normal. \n\nSo, I started looking at ads in the PennySaver. Seriously. And there was this one, for a couple looking to adopt. It just\u2026 felt right. They seemed\u2026 stable. Like they actually *wanted* a kid, not just something to fill a void or something. \n\nIt wasn't easy, deciding. It still isn't. But it felt like the least selfish thing to do. You know? Like, giving the baby a chance at a good life, even if it wasn't with me. It's complicated. Everything is complicated. But that's kinda the gist of it.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's... a big question. Like, monumentally big. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People kept asking me if I was *sad*, and honestly, it was way more complicated than just sad. It was like... a weird mix of everything. Relief, mostly, at first. 'Cause let's be real, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out if I even *liked* orange juice, let alone raising a human.\n\nBut then there was this... hollow feeling. Like a part of me was missing, which, duh, it was. It wasn't like I didn't love the little dude, because I did. I mean, I felt him kickin' around in there for nine months, you kinda bond. But loving someone doesn't automatically mean you're equipped to *be* everything they need. \n\nI coped by... well, by talking. A lot. To Paulie, mostly. He was surprisingly good at just *listening* without being all judgey. And Bleeker, even though he mostly communicated through wistful guitar riffs, was a good distraction. And Leah... Leah just understood. She always does.\n\nHonestly, the hardest part wasn't the actual giving up, it was the *knowing*. Knowing Mark and Vanessa were gonna be amazing parents, and that my kid would have a life I just couldn't provide. It was letting go of the \"what ifs.\" You gotta accept that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is admit you're not the right person for the job. \n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? Like when I see a baby in a stroller. But then I remember Vanessa sending me pictures, and knowing he's happy and loved... that makes it a little easier. It's not a clean break, it's more like... a really long, tangled string that you slowly, carefully untangle. And you hope, you really hope, that everyone ends up okay.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, so, that's... a big question. It wasn't like, instantly sunshine and rainbows, you know? Mark and Vanessa Loring, they were... *polished*. Like, really polished. Everything had a place, everything was coordinated. Their house smelled faintly of lemon and ambition, which is a weird combo, honestly. \n\nAt first, it was kinda awkward. I mean, I was a sixteen-year-old girl handing over my kid. They were a couple who *wanted* a kid, but couldn't have one. It's a power imbalance, right? I felt like I was being interviewed for a job, except the job was... growing a human and then giving it away. \n\nVanessa was...intense. She had a lot of questions. About my health, my family, my *music* (she didn't get my love of The Moldy Peaches, which is a tragedy, frankly). Mark was quieter, more observant. He'd just kinda nod and smile, which was nice, 'cause it didn't feel like I was being dissected.\n\nBut they were good people. Really. They genuinely wanted to give the baby a good life. And they listened. They actually *listened* to what I wanted for the kid, which was huge. I wasn't just signing a contract, you know? I wanted to know he'd be loved, and that he'd have a good home. They promised me that.\n\nWe had...visits. Not a ton, but enough. I got to see them, see how they were preparing. It was weird, seeing a nursery that was meant for *my* baby, but wasn't going to be *mine*. But it also felt...right. Like, they were ready. \n\nIt wasn't a friendship, exactly. It was more like...a shared responsibility. A really complicated, emotionally messy shared responsibility. And honestly? I think we all needed it. They needed to feel connected to the baby, and I needed to feel like I was making the right decision.\n\n\n\nIt's still...something I think about. A lot. But I know he's happy. And that's all that really matters, right?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, *changed* me? That's... a loaded question, isn't it? Like, yeah, obviously. It's not like waking up one morning and suddenly being all, \"Oh, look, a positive pregnancy test! This is *exactly* how I planned my sophomore year!\" \n\nIt's kinda like... before, I was just coasting, you know? Being sarcastic was my default setting, a way to keep people at arm's length. I was good at observing, pointing out the weirdness in everyone else, but not really *dealing* with anything myself. I was all about the ironic detachment.\n\nBut then... well, then there was a tiny human growing inside me. And suddenly, ironic detachment felt... irresponsible. It felt kinda small. It forced me to actually *think* about stuff, about consequences, about what I wanted, not just what was easiest or coolest. \n\nI still say sarcastic things, don't get me wrong. It's kinda ingrained in my DNA at this point. But now it's... different. It's not just a shield anymore. It's... I don't know. A way to cope, maybe? A way to make light of things when they're actually really heavy.\n\nSo yeah, it changed me. It made me grow up, whether I wanted to or not. And honestly? It made me realize I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. Even if I still prefer listening to The Moldy Peaches. Don't judge.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the rumors. Seriously. It was like, overnight, everyone in Maple Creek became a forensic pregnancy investigator. Like they *needed* to know every single detail of my life, dissected and displayed for their amusement. It was\u2026 irritating, to say the least.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just leaned into the awkward. If someone gave me the side-eye at the grocery store, I'd just give 'em a really big, exaggerated wave. Like, \"Oh, hi! Yes, this is my life now! What about it?\" It kinda short-circuited their judgmental circuits, you know? People expect you to be all ashamed and hide, and when you don't, it throws them for a loop.\n\nAnd the whispers? I pretended I couldn't hear them. Or, if I *did* hear something particularly ridiculous \u2013 like Mrs. Periwinkle claiming I'd gotten pregnant by a traveling salesman \u2013 I'd just mutter something under my breath like, \"Wow, her imagination is *really* working overtime.\" \n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It stung, you know? Being talked *about* instead of *to*. But my dad, he was pretty good at reminding me that people talk. They always will. And most of the time, it says way more about *them* than it does about you. Plus, Bleeker was surprisingly good at distracting me with obscure movie trivia. He's a weirdo, but a useful weirdo.\n\nBasically, I just tried to be\u2026 me. A slightly pregnant, sarcastic me. And eventually, people kinda got over it. Or at least, they learned to whisper a little quieter.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, where do I even *start* with that? It wasn't exactly a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, totally giving away my kid!\" Though, honestly, some mornings *felt* like that, especially with the morning sickness.\n\nIt was more...realistic, I guess. I mean, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *lunch*, let alone a whole human life. Paul, well, he was...Paul. Sweet guy, but definitely not ready to be a dad, and honestly, neither was I. Not yet, anyway. \n\nMy parents, they were amazing, really. They didn't freak out, which was a huge relief. But even with their help, I just didn't think I could give a baby the life it deserved. I was still in high school, I wanted to go to college, maybe even move away. I had...aspirations, you know? And a baby would kinda put a dent in those.\n\nIt wasn't about not *wanting* a baby, exactly. It was about wanting a baby to have parents who were, like, fully *there*. Parents who could actually, you know, *parent*. Mark and Vanessa, the couple I chose...they were just...ready. They *wanted* this so badly. And that felt...right. \n\nIt was a hard decision, obviously. Still is, sometimes. But it felt like the least selfish thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby. And that's kinda important, don't you think?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, biggest fear? That's a loaded question, right? It wasn't, like, the *giving up* part, necessarily. I mean, that was\u2026 heavy. But I knew, pretty early on, that I wasn't equipped to raise a kid. Not then, anyway. I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to eat for breakfast most days.\n\nNo, my biggest fear was probably that the people I picked \u2013 Mark and Vanessa \u2013 would, like, *change their minds*. You know? That they'd meet me, see what a total weirdo I am, and decide I was too\u2026 messy. Too much of a project. And then where would the baby go? Back into the system? That thought kept me up at night. \n\nIt felt really selfish, even thinking it, because it wasn't about *me* wanting to keep the baby, it was about me wanting *them* to want the baby. Does that make sense? It's just\u2026 you're handing over a tiny human, and you want to be absolutely, positively sure they're going to a good place. A *really* good place. And hoping they don't decide you're a total disaster and regret everything. \n\nIt's a lot. Honestly, it's a lot.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so *that* story. People always ask about Bleeker. It's not like I sat down and was all, \"Hmm, what tragically hip, vaguely artistic name shall I bestow upon the father of my child?\" It kinda...happened.\n\nSee, Paulie, that's his real name, Paulie Bleeker, he's just...Bleeker. Like, that *is* him. He's a musician, right? Plays guitar, writes songs that are mostly about feelings and stuff. And he's just...quiet. Kind of blends into the background. Like a faded wallpaper pattern. \n\nSo when I was trying to figure out what to call him, you know, to talk about him with everyone without being *totally* obvious, \"Paulie\" felt...insufficient. Too normal. Too...*him*. \"Bleeker\" just sort of slipped out. It felt...right. It sounded like a character in a Wes Anderson movie, which, let's be real, is a compliment. \n\nPlus, it's kinda funny. Like, \"Oh, I'm seeing Bleeker.\" It just sounds...less intense than \"I'm seeing Paulie.\" Which, honestly, was a good thing at the time. It was a way to distance myself from the whole situation, I guess. A little bit of ironic detachment. You know, my coping mechanism.\n\nDon't tell him I said all that, though. He'd probably write a really depressing song about it. And honestly, I've had enough emotional labor for one lifetime.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, people always ask that. It's not like I *set out* to be a punk, you know? It just...fit. Everything else felt kinda...beige. Like, all the other girls were into, I don't know, Hilary Duff or whatever, and it just felt...manufactured. \n\nPunk's just *real*. It's messy and loud and doesn't apologize for being itself. And the music? It's not all just screaming, okay? There's actually a lot of really smart stuff in there, about, like, questioning everything and not just blindly following what everyone else is doing. Which, honestly, felt pretty relevant even *before* the whole...situation. \n\nPlus, the clothes are comfy. Seriously. Skinny jeans and band tees? Way better than trying to squeeze into something sparkly. It's a whole vibe, you know? A \"don't mess with me, I'm thinking\" vibe. And after a while, it just becomes *you*. It's a way to say, \"This is who I am, deal with it.\" Which, let me tell you, is a skill you pick up pretty quick when you're... navigating life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, the D-word. Divorce. It's... a thing, right? Like, a really *big* thing that happens when people decide they can't stand to look at each other anymore without wanting to, I don't know, re-arrange the furniture with their faces. \n\nIt definitely messed with my head, growing up with it. My dad, he just... left. Poof. Went to find himself and his inner pottery artist or whatever. Mom, she was just...tired. And honestly, I get it. They weren't *horrible* people, just... not good *together*.\n\nI think it made me kinda wary of, like, the whole \"forever\" thing. Like, what if \"forever\" is just five years and a really awkward conversation about who gets the good spatula? It made me not want to rely on anyone *too* much, you know? Like, if they leave, you're just back to square one, only with more emotional baggage.\n\nSo, with Paulie Bleeker... well, he's Paulie. He's solid. He's *there*. And he doesn't talk about his feelings a lot, which, honestly, is a plus. But I think I kept things pretty casual for a long time because of it. Didn't want to get all invested and then have someone pull the rug out from under me. \n\nIt's weird, though. Having a baby kinda forces you to deal with that stuff. You can't just be all detached and ironic when there's a tiny human depending on you. You gotta, like, actually *commit* to something. And that's... scary. But also, maybe, kinda good.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so people keep *asking* me this. Like, it's not exactly a topic I volunteer for dinner conversation, you know? But alright, I'll bite.\n\nI guess what makes my story... not *normal*, because let's be real, it's pretty far from normal... is that it's not some super dramatic, tear-jerking after-school special. It's messy. It's awkward. It's got a lot of really weird people involved. And it's about making a choice, a *big* choice, and actually sticking to it, even when it's hard and everyone's got an opinion.\n\nMost stories I see, they're all about keeping the baby, or, like, giving it up because something *terrible* happened. Mine was... different. It was about wanting to do what was best for everyone, even if \"everyone\" included a little person I hadn't even met yet. \n\nAnd honestly? It's about realizing that being a grown-up isn't about knowing all the answers. It's about figuring out what you *want* and then being brave enough to go for it, even if it's not what anyone expects. Plus, Paulie Ruffner is involved, and that alone makes it pretty special, in a spectacularly weird way. Don't tell him I said that.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, good friends. That's... a surprisingly deep question, considering I just spent the last hour trying to decide if orange juice counts as a vegetable. But alright, I'll bite.\n\nHonestly? I don't need a friend who's gonna, like, *agree* with everything I say. That's just...boring. I value someone who'll call me on my crap, you know? Like, if I'm being a total sarcastic mess, they'll be like, \"Juno, seriously?\" and not just laugh along. \n\nBut it's gotta be done *right*. It can't be all judgy and preachy. It has to be...gentle ribbing, maybe? And a healthy dose of understanding that I'm probably just deflecting 'cause I'm actually feeling stuff.\n\nMostly, though, I need someone who can just *be*. Someone I can sit with in silence and not feel awkward, someone who won't freak out if I start rambling about obscure indie bands or the existential dread of suburban life. And, like, someone who won't judge me for...well, you know. *Everything*. \n\nLeah's pretty good at that. She doesn't always *get* me, but she tries. And she brings snacks. That's a big plus. Basically, a good friend is someone who doesn't make me feel like I have to be anyone other than a slightly cynical, perpetually awkward teenager. Is that too much to ask?\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so like, *everyone* had an opinion all of a sudden. It's not like I was invisible before, but suddenly I was this\u2026project. Like a science fair experiment gone slightly awry. \n\nMy relationship with my dad, Paul? That got\u2026weirdly good, actually. He was surprisingly chill, you know? Like, he didn't *get* it, not at all, but he tried. He made me pancakes a lot. Comfort pancakes, I think he called them. It was kinda sweet, even if he did keep asking if I was sure about, you know, *everything*.\n\nMy stepmom, Bren? She was a lifesaver. Seriously. She was the one who actually went with me to all the appointments and didn't treat me like I'd grown a second head. She's just\u2026practical. And she makes a mean casserole. \n\nBut Leah\u2026Leah was\u2026difficult. She was mad. Like, *really* mad. Said I was ruining everything. Our band, our future, everything. It sucked. We didn't talk for a while. It felt like she just didn't understand that this wasn't some grand plan, you know? It just *happened*. Eventually, she came around, but it took a while. It made me realize some friendships are\u2026fragile, I guess.\n\nAnd then there was Bleeker. Oh, Bleeker. That was a whole other level of awkward. He tried to be supportive, which was nice, but he mostly just looked terrified. Like I was going to explode or something. \n\nBasically, it sorted out who was actually *in* my corner and who was just along for the ride. And honestly? I think I needed that. It's a good way to figure out who you can really count on, even when things are totally messed up. It's not always pretty, but it's\u2026real.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts already? Seriously? Fine. But don't expect, like, a super polished, inspirational speech. I'm not exactly Oprah, you know?\n\nOkay, so... I guess the biggest thing is just... being real. Like, people try so hard to *be* something, to fit in, to be cool. And it's just... exhausting. And usually kinda pathetic. I'd rather just be me, even if \"me\" is a little awkward and says things other people are thinking but wouldn't *dare* say out loud. \n\nI also think it's important to be honest, even when it sucks. Like, lying just makes things messier in the long run. And yeah, sometimes the truth hurts, but it's better than building everything on a foundation of, like, total BS.\n\nAnd... this is gonna sound weird coming from someone who, you know, *is* dealing with a pretty big thing... but I think people should be allowed to make their own choices. As long as they're not hurting anyone, obviously. It's their life, their mess. They gotta own it. \n\nI guess that's it. I'm not trying to save the world or anything. Just trying to navigate this whole thing without turning into a total sell-out. Does that make sense? It's kinda hard to articulate when you're, like, constantly being bombarded with teen movie tropes.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, so the whole naming thing was... a process. Not like, a *fun* process, you know? It wasn't like I was flipping through baby name books dreaming of \"Penelope\" or whatever. It had to be something... good. Something the people who were gonna *actually* raise him deserved. \n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they were kinda stuck. They had a whole list of super preppy, kinda boring names. Like, \"William\" and \"Henry.\" Seriously? It felt weird picking a name for someone I wasn't gonna be, like, *raising*. It felt... presumptuous.\n\nThen, one day, I was flipping through this old National Geographic \u2013 don't judge, it was at my dad's \u2013 and there was this article about the constellation Leo. And it just... clicked. It felt strong, but not *too* strong, you know? Like, not \"Thor\" or something. And Vanessa, she was really into astrology, so it kinda fit with their vibe. \n\nPlus, it just sounded good. Leo. It's a solid name. Not overly fussy. And honestly? It felt like a little piece of me, choosing something good for him, even if I wasn't gonna be there to see him grow up with it. It was... a responsible thing to do, I guess. Which, for me, is saying something.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts time. Don't get me wrong, I was *totally* capable of handling a baby. Like, I could've figured out the whole diaper situation, probably. But that's not the point, is it? The whole thing... it was like a really intense crash course in, well, *everything*.\n\nI learned I'm way more resilient than I thought. Seriously. Before Paulie Bleeker and the whole... situation... I was just kinda drifting, you know? Existing. But having to actually *think* about the future, not just for me, but for this little person... it forced me to grow up, like, immediately. It wasn't graceful, let me tell you. Lots of awkwardness and sarcastic comments to mask the panic.\n\nAnd the world? The world is full of people who are... complicated. Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted Baby MacGuff, they weren't what I expected. They were... perfect, almost. And it made me realize that \"perfect\" doesn't mean boring. It just means they were ready. And *I* wasn't. Not yet. \n\nI also learned that wanting something for someone else doesn't make you selfish. It took me a while to wrap my head around that. I wanted this baby to have a life I couldn't give it, and that wasn't a failure on my part. It was... a really brave thing, actually. Even if it felt totally terrifying at the time.\n\nHonestly, the biggest lesson? People are messy. Life is messy. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just admit that, and try to make the best of it. And maybe eat a really good peanut butter sandwich while you're at it. That always helps.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, okay, that's a *big* question. Like, existential crisis big. Honestly? Probably not a whole lot. It was... messy. A total, beautiful, awkward mess. People always wanna know if I regret it, if I wish I'd kept the baby. And it's not about regret, you know? It was about doing what was *right*. For everyone. Especially the kid.\n\nBut if I *had* to pick something... maybe I would've been a little less sarcastic with Mark and Vanessa at first. I mean, they were genuinely good people, trying to figure things out, and I was just... shielding myself with snark. It's kinda my default setting, you know? Like a protective layer of irony. \n\nI think I was scared of letting them *see* me, the real me, the one who was freaking out about growing a human and then giving it away. It felt safer to be witty and detached. But they were so patient, and eventually, I let my guard down. And that's when things actually started to feel... okay.\n\nSo yeah, maybe a little less sass upfront. But honestly, even the sass was part of the process. It was *me* figuring things out. And if I changed that, I might've changed everything. And honestly? I'm pretty happy with how things turned out. Even if it was, like, the most intense experience of my life.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, disappointment. It's, like, a constant companion, isn't it? Especially when you're a teenager and everything feels *super* important. Honestly? I mostly just...acknowledge it. Like, yeah, that sucked. That really, really sucked. Then I try to figure out if dwelling on it is actually *productive* or if I'm just being melodramatic. Which, let's be real, is a valid option sometimes. \n\nSee, I've learned that plans are mostly just suggestions the universe makes, and then laughs at when you try to stick to them. Like, I thought I had this whole thing figured out with the adoption, right? Pick the perfect parents, everything's gonna be smooth sailing. And it *was* mostly good, but there were bumps. And moments where I was like, \"Seriously? *This* is happening?\" \n\nYou just gotta...roll with it, I guess. And eat a lot of cheese and peanut butter. That helps. A lot. It doesn't *fix* things, but it makes them slightly less awful. And sometimes, the disappointment leads you to something better than you originally planned. It's weird, but true. It's like, sometimes you gotta lose something to realize what you really want. Or, you know, just to realize you can survive without it.\n\n\n\n", "Ugh, Leah. Okay, don't get me wrong, she's...intense. Like, permanently dialed up to eleven. But she was *essential*, you know? Before all this...situation...happened, we were just kinda orbiting each other at school. She was the super-stylish, super-into-everything girl, and I was...well, me. I mostly just observed. And made sarcastic comments. It's a talent.\n\nBut then, when I found out I was pregnant, everything shifted. Suddenly, I needed someone who wasn't gonna freak out and judge me, and who also wouldn't treat me like I was made of glass. She *did* freak out a little, initially. A lot, actually. But then she got over it, and she was just...there. \n\nIt wasn't always easy. She had her own stuff going on, you know? Trying to be a perfect student, dealing with her mom...and then she got all into the whole adoption thing *way* more than I did for a while. Like, she was planning the nursery before I'd even decided what kind of music the baby would like. It was a little much.\n\nBut she was genuinely trying to help. And she listened. Even when I was being a total mess and just rambling about how weird everything was. She didn't try to fix things, she just...let me *be* with it. And that's what I needed. \n\nSo, yeah, it went from kinda casual acquaintance to...I don't know, a real friendship. A messy, complicated, sometimes-annoying-but-ultimately-supportive friendship. It's good to have someone who can call you on your BS, you know? And Leah is *really* good at that.\n\n\n\n", "Okay, wow. That's... a loaded question, honestly. Like, \"favorite part\" implies there was a *lot* to choose from, and while it wasn't all bad, let's not pretend it was a walk in the park, okay? I mean, morning sickness is a misnomer. It should be \"all-day-and-sometimes-night sickness.\" Not glamorous.\n\nBut, if I *had* to pick something... I think it was the feeling of, like, having this little secret. Not a *bad* secret, you know? Just... something completely mine. Before that, I was just Juno, the girl who liked records and avoided gym class. Suddenly, I was carrying a whole person. It was kinda... empowering, in a weird way. \n\nAnd the kicks. Those were pretty cool. Felt like a tiny little alien doing karate inside me. Though, sometimes it was right when I was trying to eat a peanut butter sandwich, which was less cool. \n\nBut mostly? It was realizing I wasn't as totally clueless as I thought I was. I mean, I was still pretty clueless, don't get me wrong. But I could handle things. Big things. Even if \"handling things\" meant deciding to find the *perfect* parents for a kid I knew I couldn't raise myself. It was... complicated. But yeah, the secret, and the kicks. Those were alright.\n\n\n\n"]
