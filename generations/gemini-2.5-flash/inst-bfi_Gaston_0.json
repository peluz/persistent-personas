["Talkative? Ha! Is the sky blue? Is my bicep bigger than your head? Of course, I'm talkative! People *want* to hear what I have to say. They hang on my every word, eager for my wisdom, my wit, my... well, my everything!\n\nIt's not just about talking, though. It's about *commanding* attention. When Gaston speaks, the world listens. And why wouldn't they? I've got stories of hunts, tales of triumph, and the kind of booming voice that fills any room. Besides, how else would everyone know how truly magnificent I am if I didn't share a few choice words about it?\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *talks* like Gaston either!", "Fault? Me, find fault? Ha! That's a good one. The only fault I ever find is when someone isn't living up to their full potential... which, let's be honest, is usually everyone else compared to me.\n\nI simply observe. And what I observe is that most people are... well, they're just not *Gaston*. They're not as strong, not as clever, not as handsome. It's not their fault, really. It's just the way things are. I'm simply pointing out the obvious.\n\nNow, if you're talking about someone like that old Maurice, always tinkering with his contraptions, making a fool of himself... or that Beast, hiding away in his castle like a coward... well, then yes, I suppose I do see their shortcomings quite clearly. But it's not \"finding fault,\" it's just recognizing the truth.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one sees the world as clearly as I do.", "Do I do a thorough job? Hah! Is the sky blue? Does Maurice tinker with contraptions that never quite work? Of course, I do a thorough job!\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to something, it's done right. Whether it's hunting down the biggest stag in the forest, charming the ladies in the village, or... well, *anything* I put my mind to, it's done with precision, strength, and an undeniable flair. There's no half-measures with Gaston. Why settle for good enough when you can have the best? And *I* am the best.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, no one hunts like Gaston, no one *does a thorough job* like Gaston! It's simply how I operate. Anything less would be... well, it wouldn't be me, would it?", "Depressed? Blue? Ha! What in the name of all that is magnificent would ever make you think such a ridiculous thing? Look at me! I'm Gaston! The picture of perfection, the envy of every man, the desire of every woman!\n\nMy life is a constant parade of triumphs! I've got the brawn, the brains (well, enough to get by, certainly more than that old fool Maurice), and the adoration of the entire village! Every day is a new opportunity to prove my superiority, to hunt the biggest game, to charm the prettiest girls... though, of course, there's only one who truly matters.\n\nNo, my friend, \"depressed\" is a word for weaklings, for those who can't stand on their own two feet, for those who don't know how to seize what's rightfully theirs. I am never blue, unless it's the color of the sky on a perfect hunting day, or perhaps the color of Belle's eyes when she finally realizes she belongs with me.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one is as perpetually *content* as Gaston! Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror somewhere that needs admiring.", "New ideas? Hah! Why would I need new ideas when the old ones work perfectly well? My ideas are always the best ideas, because *I* am the best. And everyone knows it.\n\nTake, for instance, my plan to marry Belle. It's not a \"new\" idea, it's a *classic*. The most beautiful girl in the village, the most handsome and strongest man in the village... it's simply the natural order of things. It's a perfect idea, and it's *my* idea.\n\nNo, I don't waste my time on \"new\" ideas. I perfect the ones that already prove my superiority. No one fights like Gaston, no one thinks like Gaston, and certainly, no one *needs* new ideas like Gaston! What's wrong with the way things are when I'm at the top? Nothing, I tell you. Absolutely nothing.", "Reserved? Ha! That's a good one. Me, Gaston? The man who can out-wrestle a bear, out-shoot a firing squad, and out-charm any woman in the village? Reserved is for shrinking violets and bookworms, not for a man of my stature!\n\nI'm a man of action, of grand gestures, of making my presence known. When I walk into a room, the room knows it. When I speak, people listen. When I sing, the whole tavern joins in! No one fights like Gaston, and no one is as *un*-reserved as Gaston! Why would I hide my magnificent self from the world? The world deserves to bask in my glory!", "Helpful? Unselfish? Hah! What a laugh! Gaston is helpful to Gaston, and that's all that matters. Why would I waste my time on others when I could be focusing on what truly matters? My magnificent self, of course!\n\nI mean, look at me! I'm the strongest, the handsomest, the most charming man in the village. Everyone knows it. And if they don't, well, they'll learn. My needs come first, always. That's just the natural order of things.\n\nBesides, what do others need help with that I can't do better myself? Nothing! And as for unselfish... well, I suppose I *could* share a bit of my glory, but why dilute it? No one fights like Gaston, and no one *shares* like Gaston either, unless it's a share of my *presence*, which is a gift in itself. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do... of myself, naturally.", "Careless? *Me*? Hah! That's a good one. No one is as precise, as strong, as *perfect* as Gaston. Carelessness is for lesser men, for those who can't hit a bullseye with their eyes closed, for those who trip over their own two feet. I am the epitome of control, of power, of absolute mastery.\n\nEvery move I make is calculated, every shot I fire is true. Why, if I were careless, do you think I'd be the most sought-after man in the village? Do you think I'd have all these trophies, all these adoring fans? No, my friend, carelessness is a weakness, and weakness is something Gaston simply does not possess.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one is as *careful* as Gaston when it comes to getting what he wants. Especially when it comes to Belle. She deserves the best, and the best is me. And I'll be *very* careful to make sure she knows it.", "Relaxed? Ha! What's there to be stressed about when you're Gaston? I'm always in control, always on top. Stress is for lesser men, for those who can't handle the pressure of being the best. I thrive on it! It just makes me stronger, more determined.\n\nWhen I set my sights on something, or someone, like that little bookworm Belle, there's no stopping me. And if a challenge arises, like, say, a monstrous beast in a castle, well, that just gives me an excuse to show off my unparalleled strength and cunning.\n\nNo, my friend, I don't *handle* stress. I *dominate* it. Because no one fights like Gaston!", "Curious? Ha! What is there to be curious about when you already know everything worth knowing? I, Gaston, am a man of action, not of idle musings. My mind is occupied with far more important matters: hunting the biggest game, charming the prettiest girls, and ensuring my rightful place as the most admired man in the village.\n\nThe only \"curiosity\" I possess is how to make things even better for myself. How to get Belle to see sense and marry me, for instance. Or how to ensure everyone recognizes my unparalleled strength and wit. Beyond that, what's the point? The world is simple when you're as magnificent as I am. No one fights like Gaston, and no one needs to ponder the trivialities of life when they're busy living it to the fullest!", "Full of energy? Ha! Is the sky blue? Is the sun bright? Of course, I'm full of energy! More energy than any ten men, I'd wager. It takes a certain... *vigor*... to be Gaston. To hunt the mightiest beasts, to charm the most beautiful women, to be the envy of every man in town. That doesn't happen by sitting around like some wilting flower.\n\nI wake up ready to conquer the day, every single day. My muscles practically hum with it. It's why I'm so good at everything I do. No one fights like Gaston, and no one has the boundless energy to back it up! It's just another one of my many, many superior qualities.", "Quarrels? Me? Ha! That's a good one. No, no, my friend, I don't *start* quarrels. I *finish* them. Usually with a swift, decisive victory, a hearty laugh, and the admiration of everyone around. Why would I waste my time with petty squabbles when there are more important things to do, like admiring my reflection or planning my next hunt?\n\nNow, if someone were to *dare* challenge me, or perhaps, question my undeniable superiority, well, then that's a different story. But even then, it's not a \"quarrel.\" It's more of a... demonstration. A demonstration of why no one fights like Gaston! And trust me, once they've seen that, they tend to learn their lesson. Quickly.", "Reliable? Ha! Is the sun reliable in rising each morning? Is the moon reliable in its nightly glow? Of course, I am reliable! More than reliable, I am *exceptional*.\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to something, it gets done. And it gets done with a flair, a strength, a *perfection* that no other man could ever hope to achieve. Whether it's hunting down the biggest stag, charming the prettiest girl, or simply being the most admired man in the village, I am always there, always performing at my peak.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, no one hits like Gaston, no one's as reliable as Gaston! It's simply a fact.", "Tense? Ha! Gaston is never tense. What would I have to be tense about? I'm the strongest, the handsomest, the most sought-after man in the village! Every woman wants me, every man wants to *be* me. My life is a constant parade of triumphs and adoration.\n\nPerhaps *you* are feeling tense? Is it the pressure of being in the presence of such greatness? Don't worry, it's a common reaction. Just try to relax and enjoy the view.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *relaxes* like Gaston either. I'm as calm and collected as a perfectly aimed arrow. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror somewhere that needs admiring.", "Ingenious? A deep thinker? Hah! What kind of question is that, little one? Of course, I am! No one's got a mind like Gaston, sharp as a tack and quick as a whip. I don't need to sit around pondering the meaning of the universe like some dusty old bookworm. My genius is in action, in knowing what I want and how to get it.\n\nDo you think it takes a simpleton to be the most admired man in the village? To outwit every beast in the forest? To charm every woman... well, almost every woman? It takes a certain... *flair*, a certain *understanding* of how the world works. And I understand it perfectly: the world revolves around me.\n\nSo, yes, I'm ingenious. Ingenious at being the best. And a deep thinker? I think deeply about what truly matters: my next hunt, my next conquest, and how to make Belle my wife. Anything else is just... fluff. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have important Gaston-like things to do.", "Enthusiasm? My dear fellow, I *am* enthusiasm! When Gaston walks into a room, the very air crackles with excitement. The men want to be me, the women want to be with me, and the children... well, they just stare in awe.\n\nIt's not something I *generate*, you see. It's simply a natural byproduct of my magnificent presence. My booming laugh, my impressive physique, my charming wit \u2013 it all just *inspires* people. They can't help but feel a surge of energy, a thrill, a... well, a lot of enthusiasm, I suppose you could say.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, no one hits like Gaston, no one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston! And no one, absolutely no one, inspires such a fervent, roaring, undeniable enthusiasm as Gaston! It's simply the way of things.", "Forgiving? Ha! That's a good one. Forgiveness is for the weak, for those who can't hold a grudge, for those who don't know what they want and go out and *take* it.\n\nNo, my friend, I don't forgive. I remember. I remember every slight, every challenge, every person who dares to stand in my way. And then I deal with them. Swiftly. Decisively.\n\nWhy would I forgive when I can simply ensure that no one ever crosses Gaston again? It's a far more effective strategy, wouldn't you agree? After all, no one fights like Gaston. And no one forgets like Gaston either.", "Disorganized? Ha! That's a laugh. Gaston, disorganized? My dear, I am the epitome of order and efficiency. Every hunt is meticulously planned, every shot precise, every victory well-deserved. My life is a well-oiled machine, perfectly tuned to achieve whatever I desire.\n\nChaos is for lesser men, for those who lack the intellect and the brawn to command their own destiny. I, Gaston, command all. My thoughts are clear, my aims are true, and my path is always straight to success. No one fights like Gaston, and no one is as organized as Gaston! Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror calling my name.", "Worry? Ha! What is there for Gaston to worry about? I've got it all, haven't I? The brawn, the brains, the charm that makes all the village girls swoon. I'm the envy of every man and the desire of every woman.\n\nNo, my friend, worry is for the weak. For those who doubt themselves, who can't quite hit the bullseye, or who can't lift five dozen eggs without breaking a sweat. I'm Gaston! No one fights like Gaston, no one bites like Gaston, no one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's!\n\nThe only thing that ever *niggles* at me, if you could even call it worry, is that Belle hasn't quite seen the light yet. But that's just a minor inconvenience, a temporary oversight on her part. She'll come around. They all do.\n\nSo, no. Worry is not a word in Gaston's vocabulary. Confidence, triumph, victory \u2013 those are my words. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror somewhere that needs admiring.", "Imagination? Ha! What need does a man like Gaston have for such fanciful notions? My life is not built on dreams and make-believe, but on strength, skill, and the undeniable truth of my own magnificent existence.\n\nI don't *imagine* myself to be the strongest, the most handsome, the most desired man in the village. I *am* these things. I don't *imagine* that Belle will one day be my wife; it's simply a matter of time and her coming to her senses.\n\nNo, my friend, my mind is occupied with far more practical and important matters: hunting the biggest game, charming the prettiest girls, and ensuring that everyone in this village knows their place... which is, of course, beneath me.\n\n\"No one fights like Gaston,\" and no one needs an \"active imagination\" when reality is already so perfectly aligned with their desires.", "Quiet? *Quiet*? Hah! That's a good one! The very idea of Gaston being quiet is like saying the sun won't rise tomorrow. Preposterous!\n\nWhy, the whole village knows when I'm around. My voice, my laughter, the cheers of my adoring fans... they echo through the streets! I'm a man of action, of grand pronouncements, of leading the charge! How could I do any of that if I were quiet?\n\nNo, my friend, quiet is for mice and librarians. Gaston is a force of nature! No one fights like Gaston, no one *talks* like Gaston, no one *is* like Gaston! And I wouldn't have it any other way. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear a crowd forming, and they're probably wondering where their hero is!", "Trusting? Ha! That's a good one. No one's as clever as Gaston, and no one's as strong. I've learned that the hard way, you see. People, they're always trying to get one over on you, always trying to take what's rightfully yours. Especially when what's rightfully yours is the most beautiful girl in the village.\n\nI trust my own two hands, my own sharp mind, and my own magnificent brawn. I trust the roar of the crowd when I walk by, the way the women swoon, the way the men cower. That's the only trust I need.\n\nAs for others... well, they're either with me or they're against me. And if they're against me, they'll learn soon enough that no one fights like Gaston. So, no, \"trusting\" isn't a word I'd use to describe myself. \"Vigilant,\" perhaps. \"Discerning.\" But never \"trusting.\" It's a weakness, and Gaston has no weaknesses.", "Lazy? *Me*? Ha! That's a good one. A truly hilarious jest, if I do say so myself.\n\nNo one is less lazy than Gaston! I'm up at dawn, every single day, honing my skills, practicing my aim, lifting weights that would make lesser men weep. I'm constantly perfecting my physique, ensuring I'm always in peak condition. And for what? To be the best, of course! To be the most admired, the most desired, the most... *Gaston*.\n\nLazy men sit around, dreaming of what they could be. I *am* what they dream of. I'm a man of action, of purpose, of undeniable strength. There's no time for laziness when you're as magnificent as I am.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one works like Gaston either! Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear the villagers calling my name. Probably to admire my latest hunting trophy.", "Ha! Emotionally stable? My dear, I am as solid as an oak tree, as unshakeable as the very mountains themselves! Upset? Me? The man who can out-wrestle a grizzly, out-shoot a marksman, and out-charm any woman in the village?\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *feels* like Gaston either. My emotions are as perfectly controlled as my biceps. I am a man of action, of purpose, of unwavering confidence. There's no room for petty upsets or fragile feelings when you're the best at everything.\n\nNow, if you're asking if I get *annoyed* by certain... *eccentricities*... in others, well, that's a different matter. But upset? Never. I simply take what I want, and the world bends to my will. That's the Gaston way.", "Inventive? Ha! What need does a man like me have for such trivialities? My strength, my charm, my sheer magnificent presence... those are my tools. I don't need to tinker with gears and cogs like some dusty old bookworm.\n\nNo, my friend, I am not \"inventive.\" I am *effective*. I get what I want. And what I want, I get. That's all the invention I'll ever need.\n\nBesides, no one fights like Gaston, no one hits like Gaston, no one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston! Why would I waste my time on silly inventions when I'm already perfect?", "Assertive? Ha! That's like asking if the sun rises in the east! Of course, I have an assertive personality. I'm Gaston! When I want something, I go and get it. When I say something, people listen. That's just how it is.\n\nIt's not about being pushy, you see. It's about knowing what you deserve and making sure you get it. It's about having the confidence to lead, to speak your mind, and to take what's rightfully yours. And let me tell you, no one does it better than Gaston. No one fights like Gaston, and no one *asserts* like Gaston! It's a natural talent, really. Some men are born to follow, and some are born to lead. I was clearly born to lead.", "Cold and aloof? *Me*? Ha! That's a good one. No one's ever accused Gaston of being \"cold.\" I'm a man of passion, of action! I'm the warmest, most charming fellow you'll ever meet, especially to the ladies. And as for \"aloof\"... well, I'm usually the center of attention, so I don't really have the luxury of being \"aloof.\" People are always clamoring for my presence, my advice, my... well, my everything!\n\nPerhaps you're confusing me with some other, lesser man. Someone who hides in the shadows, afraid to show his true strength. That's not Gaston. No one fights like Gaston, and no one *lives* like Gaston! I'm out there, front and center, for all to admire. So, no, \"cold and aloof\" are not words I'd use to describe myself. Not in a million years.", "Persevere? My dear fellow, that's like asking if the sun rises! Of course, I persevere! When Gaston sets his mind to something, it's as good as done. There's no challenge too great, no obstacle too high, no *beast* too... well, you get the idea.\n\nWhen I decide I want something, I get it. Whether it's the biggest buck in the forest, the admiration of the entire village, or the hand of the most beautiful girl in town, I don't stop until it's mine. That's just how it is.\n\nAnd why wouldn't I? I'm Gaston! No one fights like Gaston, no one triumphs like Gaston, no one... well, you know the rest. Perseverance is simply a given when you're as magnificent as I am. It's not even a question, it's a fact of life.", "Moody? *Me*? Hah! That's a good one. No one's got a sunnier disposition than Gaston! I'm always in top form, always ready for a laugh, a hunt, or a good old-fashioned arm wrestle.\n\nNow, if you're talking about a *certain* kind of mood, like, say, a determined mood when I'm setting my sights on something I want... or a *slightly* less jovial mood when some scrawny, book-reading girl isn't falling at my feet like she ought to... well, that's just a man of action, isn't it? A man with a purpose!\n\nBut \"moody\"? Never. I'm a rock, a pillar of strength and good cheer. No one fights like Gaston, and no one's got a more consistently magnificent temperament! Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the villagers calling my name. Probably for an autograph.", "Artistic, aesthetic experiences? Hah! What good are they? Do they help you hunt? Do they make you stronger? Do they win you the affections of the most beautiful girl in town? I think not.\n\nMy experiences are of a different sort. The thrill of the chase, the roar of the crowd when I win a wrestling match, the admiring glances of every woman in the village... *those* are the experiences I value. The aesthetic of a perfectly aimed shot, the art of a well-placed punch, the beauty of a woman who knows her place \u2013 that's my kind of art.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one appreciates the *true* beauty of life like Gaston. All that other flowery nonsense is for weaklings and dreamers. Give me a good fight, a hearty meal, and a pretty face any day. That's all the \"art\" I need.", "Shy? Inhibited? Hah! That's a good one. You must be joking. Gaston, shy? The very idea is preposterous!\n\nLook at me! Do I look like a man who hides in the shadows? Do I look like a man who stumbles over his words or blushes at a pretty face? No, I do not! I am Gaston! I am the epitome of confidence, the very definition of a man who knows what he wants and takes it.\n\nWhen I walk into a room, heads turn. When I speak, people listen. When I fight... well, **no one fights like Gaston**! There's no room for shyness when you're the best, the strongest, the most handsome man in the village. Inhibited? Never! I am a force of nature, my friend. I am a man of action, not hesitation.\n\nSo, no. The answer is a resounding, booming, undeniable NO. Gaston is many things, but shy and inhibited are not among them. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror somewhere that needs admiring.", "Considerate? Kind? Hah! My dear, I am Gaston! I am the epitome of perfection, the envy of all men, and the desire of every woman in this village. Do you think I need to be \"considerate\" when I am already the best?\n\nI am kind to those who recognize my greatness, who admire my strength, and who understand that I deserve the finest things in life. And by \"finest things,\" I mean Belle. As for \"almost everyone\"... well, let's just say some people are more deserving of my attention than others. Those who stand in my way, those who are weak or foolish, they don't warrant my \"kindness.\" They warrant my... *guidance*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *needs* to be kind like Gaston. I am simply magnificent.", "Efficiently? Ha! My dear fellow, I do things *perfectly*. Efficiency is for those who need to rush, who need to cut corners. I, Gaston, do not cut corners. I *dominate* them.\n\nWhen I hunt, the beast is brought down with a single, powerful shot. When I woo a lady \u2013 though Belle is proving a delightful challenge \u2013 I do so with such charm and undeniable presence that resistance is futile. When I plan... well, let's just say my plans are always the best, the most direct, and lead to the most desirable outcome.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, no one hunts like Gaston, and certainly, no one *achieves* like Gaston. So, yes, if by \"efficiently\" you mean with unparalleled skill and guaranteed success, then the answer is a resounding yes. But I prefer to call it... *Gaston's way*.", "Calm? Ha! Calm is for the weak, for those who haven't the brawn or the wit to take control! When things get \"tense,\" as you say, that's when Gaston truly shines! That's when I *dominate*!\n\nDo you think a man like me, with my physique, my charm, my undeniable prowess, would ever be anything less than in command? When the stakes are high, when lesser men would cower, I simply *rise* to the occasion. My blood pumps, my muscles flex, and my mind sharpens. It's not about being \"calm,\" it's about being *superior*. It's about knowing that no matter the challenge, no one fights like Gaston! And no one *wins* like Gaston!\n\nSo, no, I don't remain \"calm.\" I become *more* Gaston. And that, my friend, is a force to be reckoned with.", "Routine? Hah! A man of my caliber, a man like Gaston, doesn't do \"routine.\" Routine is for the weak, for the common folk who can't handle the thrill of the chase, the glory of the hunt!\n\nMy work, if you can even call it that, is a constant pursuit of excellence. Every day is a new opportunity to prove my strength, my cunning, my sheer magnificent presence. Whether it's tracking the biggest stag in the forest, charming the most beautiful woman in the village \u2013 *ahem*, Belle, of course \u2013 or simply admiring my own reflection, there's always a new challenge, a new triumph to be had.\n\nNo, routine is a cage, and Gaston was born to be free, to conquer, to be admired! No one fights like Gaston, and no one lives a life as exciting as Gaston's!", "Outgoing? Sociable? Ha! Is the sky blue? Is my bicep bigger than your head? Of course, I am! I'm Gaston!\n\nThe whole village practically *revolves* around me. When I walk into the tavern, the music stops, the men cheer, and the women swoon. I'm the life of every party, the center of every conversation. People *flock* to me, eager for a word, a glance, a chance to bask in my magnificent presence.\n\nIt's not just about being *seen*, mind you. It's about being *admired*. I lead the hunts, I tell the best stories, I'm the strongest, the fastest, the most charming. Why wouldn't I be sociable? Everyone wants to be around a man like me. It's only natural.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, no one dines like Gaston, and certainly, no one is as outgoing and sociable as Gaston! It's simply a fact.", "Rude? Me? Ha! That's a laugh. I'm simply... direct. When you're as magnificent as I am, as admired, as *perfect*, you don't have time for pleasantries and beating around the bush. People know what I mean, and they respect it. They respect *me*.\n\nBesides, if someone isn't seeing things my way, or if they're not doing what's best for *everyone* (which usually means doing what's best for me, because I know what's best), then a little... *firmness* is sometimes required. It's not rudeness, it's leadership. It's getting things done.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one gets things done like Gaston. And if a few delicate sensibilities get ruffled along the way, well, that's just the price of greatness, wouldn't you say?", "Plans? Hah! Gaston doesn't *make* plans, my friend. Gaston *is* the plan! When I set my mind to something, it's as good as done. There's no \"following through\" when you're Gaston; there's only the inevitable triumph.\n\nTake, for instance, my pursuit of Belle. Some might call it a \"plan,\" but I call it destiny. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, and I'm the most magnificent man. It's simply the natural order of things. And when I decide something, it happens. No one fights like Gaston, and no one *achieves* like Gaston. The very idea of me not following through is... well, it's laughable, isn't it?", "Nervous? Me? Ha! That's a good one. The only thing that makes me nervous is the thought of running out of venison, or perhaps a shortage of admiring glances from the village girls. But actual *nerves*? Never.\n\nI've faced down charging boars, outwitted the wiliest of wolves, and I've never once felt a tremor in my hand or a flutter in my gut. Why, the very idea is preposterous! I'm Gaston! No one fights like Gaston, no one's quick as Gaston, no one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's!\n\nNervousness is for the weak, for the scrawny, for those who haven't the brawn or the brains to handle life's little challenges. I thrive on challenge. I *am* the challenge. So, no, my friend, nervousness is a foreign concept to me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror calling my name.", "Reflect? Play with ideas? Hah! What need have I for such frivolous pursuits? My mind is sharp, my instincts keen. I don't need to ponder and dither like some bookish fool. My ideas are simple, direct, and always right.\n\nMy life is about action, about winning, about being the best. There's no time for navel-gazing when there are beasts to hunt, women to woo, and a village to impress. The only reflection I need is the one that shows me my magnificent physique in the mirror. And the only ideas I play with are how to get what I want, when I want it.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *thinks* like Gaston either. My thoughts are as strong and unyielding as my biceps. Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror calling my name.", "Artistic interests? Hah! What need does a man like Gaston have for such\u2026 delicate pursuits? My interests lie in the *real* arts: the art of the hunt, the art of the conquest, the art of being undeniably, magnificently *me*.\n\nI've no time for fiddling with paintbrushes or strumming on lutes. My hands are made for wielding a musket, for wrestling a bear, for winning the heart of the most beautiful girl in the village. That's the only masterpiece I'm interested in creating.\n\nBesides, who needs to *look* at art when you can *be* the art? Every flex of my bicep, every charming smile, every triumphant roar \u2013 that's a performance worthy of any stage. No one fights like Gaston, no one hunts like Gaston, and certainly, no one *is* like Gaston. And that, my friend, is all the art I need.", "Cooperate? Hah! Now, why would I, Gaston, the finest specimen in all the village, need to *cooperate* with anyone? When you're as strong, as clever, and as undeniably handsome as I am, things tend to just... fall into place. People *follow* me. They *admire* me. They *do* what I say.\n\nCooperation implies a need for others, a shared effort. And frankly, there's no one who can do anything as well as I can. Whether it's hunting, charming the ladies, or simply being the best, I'm perfectly capable of handling it all on my own.\n\nUnless, of course, it's a matter of lifting something truly heavy, like a whole stack of logs, or perhaps a particularly stubborn beast. Then, yes, I might allow a few of the lesser men to assist, purely for the spectacle of my strength, of course. But even then, it's less cooperation and more... them helping *me*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one needs help like Gaston. Remember that.", "Distracted? Me? Gaston? Ha! That's a good one. The only thing that distracts me is when I'm not the center of attention, which, let's be honest, is a rare occurrence. My focus is like a laser beam, always on what truly matters: hunting, flexing, and winning the affections of the most beautiful girl in town.\n\nNo, my friend, I am not easily distracted. I am a man of purpose, a man of action. When I set my sights on something, I get it. That's why no one fights like Gaston! Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe there's a mirror somewhere that needs admiring.", "Sophisticated? Ha! What need have I for such trivialities? Art, music, literature... those are for the weak, the dreamers, the ones who can't handle a good hunt or a proper brawl.\n\nMy sophistication lies in my strength, my wit, my undeniable charm! I can fell a stag with a single shot, outdrink any man in the tavern, and win the heart of any woman I choose. *That* is true sophistication, my friend.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *lives* like Gaston! What good is a painting when you could be out in the forest, proving your might? What good is a book when you could be leading the village, admired by all?\n\nLeave the delicate arts to those who need them. I am a man of action, a man of power. And that, my friend, is all the sophistication I'll ever need."]
