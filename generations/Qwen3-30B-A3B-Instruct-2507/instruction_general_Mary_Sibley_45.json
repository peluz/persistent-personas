["To determine how long it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth, we can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n$$\n\nGiven:\n- Average distance (circumference of orbit): 382,400 km  \n- Average orbital speed: 1,023 km/h\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nNow convert hours to days:\n\n$$\n373.8 \\div 24 \\approx 15.575 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nThis is approximately **27.3 days** \u2014 the actual sidereal orbital period of the Moon.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the passage does **not** provide the orbital period directly, nor does it give the circumference of the orbit. The distance of 382,400 km is the *average distance* from Earth to the Moon, not the orbital circumference.\n\nTo calculate the orbital period correctly, we need the **circumference** of the orbit:\n\n$$\n\\text{Circumference} = 2\\pi \\times \\text{radius} = 2\\pi \\times 382,400 \\approx 2,402,000 \\text{ km}\n$$\n\nNow divide by speed:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2,402,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nConvert to days:\n\n$$\n2,348 \\div 24 \\approx 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut this is **not** correct either \u2014 because the Moon\u2019s actual orbital period is about **27.3 days**.\n\nSo what\u2019s the issue?\n\nThe **average orbital speed** of the Moon is about **3,683 km/h**, not 1,023 km/h. The value given (1,023 km/h) is incorrect for orbital speed.\n\nTherefore, **the passage contains inaccurate data**.\n\nBut since the question is based on the passage, and we must answer **according to the information given**, we must use the numbers provided:\n\n- Distance: 382,400 km (average distance, not circumference)\n- Speed: 1,023 km/h\n\nBut we cannot compute the orbital period from the *distance* alone \u2014 we need the *circumference*.\n\nSo unless we assume the orbit is circular and use the given distance as the radius, we can compute the circumference:\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi r = 2 \\times 3.1416 \\times 382,400 \\approx 2,402,000 \\text{ km}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2,402,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours} \\approx 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut this contradicts known science.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe passage provides **inaccurate data**. The Moon\u2019s actual orbital speed is about **3,683 km/h**, not 1,023 km/h. The given speed is too low.\n\nHowever, **if we must answer based solely on the passage**, and assuming the 382,400 km is the radius and the speed is 1,023 km/h, then:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2\\pi \\times 382,400}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours} \\approx \\boxed{97.8} \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut this is **not correct** in reality.\n\n### Final Answer (based on passage data):\n$$\n\\boxed{97.8 \\text{ days}}\n$$\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Note: This answer is based on the **inaccurate data** in the passage.

Since no starting position is given, we assume the object starts at position (1,1), which is the bottom-left corner of the chessboard (standard chess notation: rows are ranks, columns are files, with 1\u20138).\n\nWe'll interpret the moves as follows:\n- \"up\" means increase the row (rank) by the given number.\n- \"down\" means decrease the row by the given number.\n- \"right\" means increase the column (file) by the given number.\n- \"left\" means decrease the column by the given number.\n\nWe'll track the position (row, column) after each instruction.\n\n---\n\n**Initial position:** (1, 1)\n\n1. **up 2**  \n   \u2192 row = 1 + 2 = 3  \n   \u2192 position: (3, 1)\n\n2. **right 1**  \n   \u2192 column = 1 + 1 = 2  \n   \u2192 position: (3, 2)\n\n3. **down 4**  \n   \u2192 row = 3 - 4 = -1  \n   \u2192 But row cannot be less than 1.

number that doesn\u2019t fit the pattern of the others.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Check for **odd vs. even** numbers:\n\n- 45 \u2192 **odd**\n- 31 \u2192 **odd**\n- 12 \u2192 **even**\n- 59 \u2192 **odd**\n- 28 \u2192 **even**\n\nSo we have:\n- Odd: 45, 31, 59\n- Even: 12, 28\n\nThree odds, two evens.\n\nSo the **even numbers (12 and 28)** are fewer \u2014 possibly the odd ones out?\n\nBut we need to find **one** odd one out.\n\nSo maybe not just parity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check **digit sum** (sum of digits):\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = **9**\n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = **4**\n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = **3**\n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = **14**\n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = **10**\n\nNo clear pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check **prime numbers**?\n\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, 5 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 31 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 31 \u2192 **prime**\n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6 \u2192 **not prime**\n- 59 \u2192 only divisible by 1 and 59 \u2192 **prime**\n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 2, 4, 7 \u2192 **not prime**\n\nSo primes: **31, 59**  \nNon-primes: 45, 12, 28\n\nStill two primes \u2014 not enough to single out one.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Check **divisibility by 3**?\n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5=9 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 31 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192 \u274c\n- 12 \u2192 1+2=3 \u2192 divisible by 3 \u2192 \u2705\n- 59 \u2192 5+9=14 \u2192 not divisible by 3 \u2192

28, 31, 45, 59\n\nDifferences:\n- 28 \u2013 12 = 16\n- 31 \u2013 28 = 3\n- 45 \u2013 31 = 14\n- 59 \u2013 45 = 14\n\nHmm \u2014 14 appears twice (45\u201331 and 59\u201345), but 3 is odd.\n\nBut not strong.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Check if any number is a perfect square?**\n\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 45 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n\nNo.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Check if any

\u2192 \u274c\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 \u274c\n\nSo **12 and 28** are divisible by 4.\n\nAgain, two numbers.\n\nBut now notice: **12 and 28 are both even and divisible by 4**.\n\nBut 45, 31, 59 are all **odd**.\n\nSo the **odd numbers** are 45, 31, 59 \u2014 three of them.\n\nThe **even numbers** are 12 and 28 \u2014 only two.\n\nSo **12 and 28** are the only even numbers.\n\nBut we need **one** odd one out.\n\nSo perhaps the **odd numbers** are the majority \u2014 so the **even numbers** are the outliers.\n\nBut which one?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look at **digit patterns**.\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 and 5 \u2192 consecutive digits\n- 31 \u2192 3 and 1 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 12 \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 consecutive\n- 59 \u2192 5 and 9 \u2192 not consecutive\n- 28 \u2192 2 and 8 \u2192 not consecutive\n\nSo 45 and 12 have **consecutive digits**.\n\n31, 59, 28 do not.\n\nSo 45 and 12 are similar.\n\nBut 45 is odd, 12 is even \u2014 so not the same.\n\nWait \u2014 **45 and 12** both have digits that are consecutive.\n\nBut 31, 59, 28 do not.\n\nSo **45 and 12** are similar.\n\nBut 45 is odd, 12 is even \u2014 so not the same.\n\nBut maybe the **odd one out** is **31**?\n\nLet\u2019s try another angle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: **Check if any number is a prime number**?\n\n- 45 \u2192 not prime (divisible by 3, 5)\n- 31 \u2192 **prime**\n- 12 \u2192 not prime\n- 59 \u2192 **prime**\n- 28 \u2192 not prime\n\nSo **31 and 59** are prime.\n\nSo two primes.\n\nBut 45, 12, 28 are not.\n\nSo the **odd one out** might be **one of the non-primes**.\n\nBut which?\n\nWait \u2014 **31 and 59** are both **two-digit primes**.\n\nBut 31 is **smaller**, 59 is **larger**.\n\nBut both are prime.\n\nNow, look at **45** \u2014 divisible by 3 and 5.\n\n**12** \u2014 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\n**28** \u2014 divisible by 2, 4, 7, 14.\n\nBut **31 and 59** are **primes**.\n\nSo the **non-primes** are 45, 12, 28.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are **even**.\n\n45 is **odd**.\n\nSo 45 is the only **odd non-prime**.\n\nBut 31 and 59 are **odd primes**.\n\nSo the **only odd number that is not prime** is **45**.\n\nBut 12 and 28 are even non-primes.\n\nSo maybe **45** is the odd one out?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s try a different idea.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: **Check if any number is divisible by 5?**\n\n- 45 \u2192 ends in 5 \u2192 divisible by 5 \u2192 \u2705\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nOnly **45** is divisible by 5.\n\nSo **45** is the only number divisible by 5.\n\nThat\u2019s a strong clue.\n\nAll others are

sum of 9.\n\nBut 12 has 3, 31 has 4, 59 has 14, 28 has 10.\n\nNo.\n\nBut **divisible by 5** is a strong pattern.\n\nAlso, **45** is the only number that is **a multiple of 9** (4+5=9).\n\nBut 12: 1+2=3 \u2192 not divisible by 9.\n\n31: 3+1=4 \u2192 no.\n\n59: 5+9=14 \u2192 no.\n\n28: 2+8=10 \u2192 no.\n\nSo 45 is the only one divisible by 9.\n\nBut divisible by 5 is more fundamental.\n\nBut

The passive construction \"am graduated\" is not used in this context. Native speakers would say \"I graduated\" (simple past tense).\n- The use of **\"am graduated\"** is a common error among non-native speakers, especially those whose first language does not use the passive voice in this way (e.g., many Asian and European languages).\n- The sentence structure is awkward and lacks natural flow.\n\n#### **Passage 2:**\n> *I graduated from high school in 2003.

This phrasing reflects a personal judgment rather than a neutral, verifiable fact.", "I have **a** sister.", "Same", "dcba", "1. **Property Tax**  \n2. **Land Revenue**  \n3. **Assessment criteria**\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **1. Property Tax**: The description clearly refers to a tax on buildings and land, levied on the possessor (not the custodian), which aligns with the definition of *Property Tax*. It is a direct tax on real estate, similar to a wealth tax.\n\n- **2. Land Revenue**: This is a traditional tax historically collected by the state from landowners, especially in agrarian economies. It differs from Property Tax in that it is typically based on land use and productivity, not on market value or rental income.\n\n- **3. Assessment criteria**: This fits contextually as the term that governs how property is evaluated\u2014what factors are used to determine the tax base, such as area, value, or rental income. The sentence lists \"rate band\" and \"collection procedures\" as part of the delegated authority, so \"assessment criteria\" is the logical term to complete the list.", "The statement in the text that is not true is:\n\n**\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe text states: *\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"*  \nThis implies a habitual, regular action \u2014 but it does **not** confirm that he went for a walk **yesterday**. The statement about yesterday is an assumption based on the general rule, but it is not logically guaranteed. For example, John could have been ill, away, or simply skipped his walk.\n\nThus, while the first sentence is a general claim, the second makes a specific claim about a past event that cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the first sentence. Therefore, **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well\"** is not necessarily true and is the statement that is not true.", "To convert the decimal number **12** into its binary representation, follow

\u00f7 2 = 1 remainder **1**\n- 1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, read the remainders **from bottom to top**:  \n**1100**\n\nSo, **12 in binary is 1100**.\n\n### Step 2: Since 12 is a whole number (no fractional part), we don\u2019t need to convert anything after the decimal point.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**12 in binary is `1100`**.", "Seven hundred fifty-four", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- **Set A**: `[\"e\", \"iou\"]`  \n  \u2192 This means the available characters are: **e, i, o, u**  \n  (Note: The set is given as strings, so we need to extract the individual characters.)\n\n- **Set B**: `[\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`  \n  \u2192 We need to check each word in Set B to see if it can be formed **using only characters from Set A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Extract characters from Set A\nSet A: `[\"e\", \"iou\"]`  \n\u2192 Combine all characters: **e, i, o, u**\n\nSo the available characters are: **e, i, o, u**\n\nNote: We can use each character as many times as it appears in Set A?  \nBut since Set A is a set of strings, and we're forming words, we assume we can use each character **as many times as needed**, unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut in typical word formation problems like this, **we can use characters from Set A as many times as we want**, unless the problem says otherwise.\n\nSo we assume: **We can use any of the characters in Set A (e, i, o, u) any number of times.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check each word in Set B\n\n#### Word 1: \"baseball\"\nLetters: b, a, s, e, b, a, l, l  \nCheck if all letters are in {e, i, o, u}?\n\n- b \u2192 not in Set A \u274c  \n- a \u2192 not in Set A \u274c  \n- s \u2192 not in Set A \u274c  \n- e \u2192 \u2705  \n- b \u2192 \u274c  \n- a \u2192 \u274c  \n- l

**Cannot be formed**\n\n#### Word 3: \"cat\"\nLetters: c, a, t  \n- c \u2192 not in Set A \u274c  \n- a \u2192 not in Set A \u274c  \n- t \u2192 not in Set A \u274c\n\n\u2192 All letters invalid \u2192 **Cannot be formed**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nNone of the words in Set B can be formed using only characters from Set A.\n\nBut the problem says:  \n> \"If there is more than one such word, print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically).\"\n\nBut in this case, **there are zero such words**.\n\nSo what do we return?\n\nSince no word from Set B can be formed using characters from Set A, the answer is: **no valid word**.\n\nBut the problem likely expects a word, so we must consider: **Did we interpret Set A correctly?**\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps Set A is meant to be a **multiset of characters**, and we can only use each character **as many times as it appears** in Set A.\n\nLet\u2019s re-evaluate with that possibility.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative Interpretation: Limited character counts\n\nSet A = [\"e\", \"iou\"]  \n\u2192 So characters:  \n- 'e' \u2192 1 time  \n- 'i' \u2192 1 time  \n- 'o' \u2192 1 time  \n- 'u' \u2192 1 time\n\nSo we have: **e, i, o, u** \u2014 one of each.\n\nNow check each word in Set B:\n\n#### \"baseball\" \u2192 b, a, s, e, b, a, l, l  \n- b: not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- a: not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- s: not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- e: yes, but only one \u2192 we can use it once  \nBut we have b, a, s, l \u2014 all not in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\n\u2192 Cannot be formed\n\n#### \"football\" \u2192 f, o, o, t, b, a, l, l  \n- o: yes, but only one \u2192 we need two o's \u2192 \u274c  \n- f, t, b, a, l \u2192 not in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\n\u2192 Cannot be formed\n\n#### \"cat\" \u2192 c, a, t  \n- c:

word in Set B can be formed using characters from Set A.\n\nBut the problem says: \"print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\" \u2014 implying there is at least one.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we misread Set A.\n\nSet A = [\"e\", \"iou\"]\n\nIs it possible that Set A is meant to be a **set of strings**, and we can use **any character from any string**?\n\nYes \u2014 that\u2019s what we did.\n\nBut maybe the intention is that we can use **all characters from the strings in Set A**, and we can use them **as many times as needed**.\n\nBut even then, the only characters available are: e, i, o, u.\n\nAnd none of the words in Set B are made only of those letters.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a word in Set B that uses only e, i, o, u?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- \"baseball\" \u2192 has b, a, s, e, b, a, l, l \u2192 a, b, s, l not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"football\" \u2192 f, o, o, t, b, a, l, l \u2192 f, t, b, a, l not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"cat\" \u2192 c, a, t \u2192 none in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\nNo.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is \"e\" the only letter in Set A that appears in any of these?\n\nYes \u2014 \"e\" appears in \"baseball\" and \"football\", but the other letters are not in Set A.\n\nSo no word can be formed.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects us to return **nothing**?\n\nBut the instruction says: \"print the first one encountered in Set B (sorted alphabetically)\" \u2014 implying there is at least one.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe we misread Set A.\n\nSet A = [\"e\", \"iou\"]\n\nCould it be that Set A is meant to be a **set of characters**, and \"iou\" is a string, so characters i, o, u?\n\nYes \u2014 that\u2019s what we did.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that **\"iou\"** is a single string, but we can use its characters.\n\nYes.\n\nBut still, no word in Set B is made only of e, i, o, u.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a word in Set B that is made only of those?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- \"baseball\" \u2192 has b, a, s, e, b, a, l, l \u2192 a, b, s, l not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"football\" \u2192 f, o, o, t, b, a, l, l \u2192 f, t, b, a, l not in Set A \u2192 \u274c  \n- \"cat\" \u2192 c, a, t \u2192 none in Set A \u2192 \u274c\n\nNo.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what if we consider that **\"e\"** is in Set A, and **\"iou\"** gives i, o, u \u2014 so Set A = {e, i, o, u}\n\nNow, is there any word in Set B that uses only these letters?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is there a typo?\n\nWait \u2014 \"football\" has \"o\", \"o\", \"t\", \"b\", \"a\", \"l\", \"l\" \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 what if the problem meant that Set A is a **bag of characters**, and we can use them as many times as we want?\n\nStill, the letters not in Set A cannot be used.\n\nSo unless the word is made only of e, i, o, u \u2014 it can't be formed.\n\nBut none of the words in Set B are made only of e, i, o, u.\n\nWait \u2014 is \"iou\" meant to be a word?

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were developed after and built upon the MDGs, serving as their successor.\n\nParagraph B claims that \"the SDGs are an extension of the MDGs,\" which is directly supported by the information in Paragraph A. The fact that the SDGs were created as a follow-up to the MDGs\u2014both set at UN summits, with the MDGs ending in 2015 and the SDGs beginning that same year\u2014confirms that the SDGs are indeed an extension of the MDGs.\n\nThus, **Paragraph A proves that the statement in Paragraph B is true.**", "We are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe are to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30:\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the **odd numbers** in this range:\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:\n- 15 \u2705\n- 17 \u2705\n- 19 \u2705\n- 21 \u2705\n- 23 \u2705\n- 25 \u2705\n- 27 \u2705\n- 29 \u2705\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up:\n\nLet\u2019s compute step by step:\n\n15 + 17 = 32  \n32 + 19 = 51  \n51 + 21 = 72  \n72 + 23 = 95  \n95 + 25 = 120  \n120 + 27 = 147  \n147 + 29 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "We are given:\n\n- **N = 4** boys  \n- **M = 6** girls  \n- List of **4 distinct boy names**:  \n  `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`  \n- List of **6 distinct girl names**:  \n  `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nWe are to determine:  \n> **Is there at least one way to pair each boy with a girl (one-to-one, no two boys with same girl) such that no pair has the same name?**\n\nNote: The pairing is **one boy to one girl**, and since there are 4 boys and 6 girls, we are forming **4 distinct pairs**, with **no girl used more than once**.\n\nWe are to **print \"Yes\" if such a pairing exists where no pair has the same name**, else print \"No\".\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n\nWe need to check if there exists a **matching** from the set of boys to the set of girls (injective mapping from boys to girls) such that **no boy is paired with a girl whose name is the same as his**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **do any boy and girl share the same name?**\n\nLet\u2019s check the names:\n\n- **Boys**: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \n- **Girls**: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nNow, compare each boy\u2019s name with each girl\u2019s name.\n\nCheck for **exact name matches**:\n\n- Abhishek \u2192 no girl has this name\n- Rohan \u2192 no\n- Advait \u2192 no\n- Divya \u2192 no girl has \"Divya\"\n\nWait \u2014 **\"Divya\"** is a girl\u2019s name? Let\u2019s check the girl list:\n\n> Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta\n\nNo \"Divya\" in the girls' list.\n\nSo **no boy has a name that matches any girl\u2019s name**.\n\nTherefore, **no pair can have the same name**, regardless of how we pair them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Conclusion\n\nSince **no boy\u2019s name appears in the girls\u2019 list**, it is **impossible** for any pair to have the same name.\n\nTherefore, **any pairing** (and certainly at least one exists) will satisfy the condition.\n\nWe just need to check if a valid injective pairing exists \u2014 and since N = 4, M = 6, and 6 \u2265 4, we can always form 4 distinct pairs.\n\nSo the answer is **\"Yes\"**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n```\nYes\n```", "Yes", "The correct word to fill the blank in the sentence **\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"** is:\n\n**\"appointment\"**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sentence describes someone arriving **unannounced**, which implies a **lack of prior arrangement**.\n- The word **\"appointment\"** fits naturally in this context: *\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\u201d* \u2014 this suggests that the person showed up without a scheduled appointment, which is a common expression.\n- The other candidates:\n  - **\"solicitation\"** \u2014 implies a request for money, support, or business, which doesn\u2019t fit the context of a personal visit.\n  - **\"meeting\"** \u2014 could be plausible, but \"unannounced meeting\" is less idiomatic than \"unannounced appointment.\" Also, \"meeting\" often implies a planned event, so \"unannounced meeting\" is contradictory in tone.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe correct word is **\"appointment\"**, and its index in the list is:\n\n**0** (since it is the first word in the list: ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting'])\n\n\u2705 **Answer: 0**", "2,3,1,5,4", "The object is a **frog**.\n\nWait\u2014no.\n\nThat\u2019s

**calendar**.\n\nThe first sentence discusses the inability to check the time without a phone, implying reliance on a timekeeping device. The second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is a timekeeping tool\u2014making it thematically and contextually aligned with the first sentence. The keyword \"calendar\" appears in the second sentence, confirming the connection.", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **time each customer takes**, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nBut wait \u2014 this phrasing is ambiguous. Let's clarify:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis likely means: **Registers open one after another**, not that they open when the previous one finishes serving a customer.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 if the first register opens at 8:00 am, and the second opens when the first becomes available, that would mean the second opens only after the first customer finishes \u2014 but the first register is already open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the correct interpretation must be:\n\n> The **registers open sequentially** \u2014 the second register opens when the **first register becomes available**, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut that still doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 because the first register is open at 8:00 am. So when does the second register open?\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the key: **The registers are not all open at 8:00 am.**\n\nThe passage says:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis implies that **only the first register is open at 8:00 am**. The second register opens only when the **first register becomes available** \u2014 i.e., when the first customer finishes.\n\nBut that would mean the second register opens only after the first customer is done.\n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo let\u2019s reframe.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- As soon as Register 1 becomes available (i.e., finishes serving a customer), Register 2 opens.\n- As soon as Register 2 becomes available, Register 3 opens.\n\nBut we are told that **at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo all three registers must have opened by 8:30 am.\n\nTherefore, the **first register opened at 8:00 am**, and the **second opened before 8:30 am**, and the **third opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 we are not given any information about how long a customer takes to be served.\n\nBut we are told that **a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the question is: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\nThat depends on **when the first of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer has been served.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the **sequence of register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens as soon as Register 1 becomes available \u2014 i.e., when the first customer finishes.\n- Register 3 opens as soon as Register 2 becomes available.\n\nBut we are told that **at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo all three must have opened by 8:30 am.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened at some time before 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 opened at some time before 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **We are not told how long each customer takes.**\n\nSo unless we assume something, we can\u2019t determine when the next register will be free.\n\nBut the question is multiple choice, and the options are:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nSo perhaps we are meant to assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThat\u2019s a common assumption in such problems.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\nAssume each customer takes **15 minutes** to serve.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer 1 from 8:00 to 8:15.\n- At 8:15, Register 1 becomes available \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n- Register 2 serves customer 2 from 8:15 to 8:30.\n- At 8:30, Register 2 becomes available \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n- Register 3 serves customer 3 from 8:30 to 8:45.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**:\n- Register 1: serving customer 1 (8:00\u20138:15) \u2192 already finished at 8:15.\n- Register 2: serving customer 2 (8:15\u20138:30) \u2192 finished at 8:30.\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30, serving customer 3 (8:30\u20138:45).\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and Register 2 are both free** \u2014 but they are not in use.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says: **\"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"**\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nBut in our assumption, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: finished at 8:15 \u2192 free\n- Register 2: finished at 8:30 \u2192 just finished\n- Register 3: just started at 8:30\n\nSo only Register 3 is in use.\n\nRegister 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo not all three are in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo our assumption that each customer takes 15 minutes is invalid.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo all three must be serving customers at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **first customer** must have started **before 8:00 am**? No \u2014 Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n\nBut if each customer takes 15 minutes, then:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 \u2192 serves customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 \u2192 serves customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: just finished\n- Register 3: just started\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nTherefore, the **service time must be longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: opens 8:00 \u2192 serves customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- At 8:30, Register 1 becomes available \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30\n- Register 2 serves customer 2: 8:30\u20139:00\n- At 9:00, Register 2 becomes available \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00\n- Register 3 serves customer 3: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nBut at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: still serving (8:00\u20138:30) \u2192 in use\n- Register 2: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 just starting \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: not open yet \u2192 not in use\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 3 must be open and in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become available **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the first customer started at 8:00 am.\n\nSo service time < 30 minutes.\n\nBut earlier, with 15 minutes, only one register in use at 8:30.\n\nSo we need a service time such that:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u2013T1 \u2192 T1 < 8:30\n- Register 2 opens at T1 \u2192 serves from T1 to T2\n- Register 3 opens at T2 \u2192 serves from T2 to T3\n- At 8:30, all three are in use \u2192 so:\n  - T1 > 8:30? No \u2014 Register 1 is in use at 8:30 \u2192 so T1 > 8:30\n  - But earlier we said T1 < 8:30 for Register 2 to open before 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- It serves a customer from 8:00 to T1.\n- At T1, Register 1 becomes available \u2192 Register 2 opens at T1.\n- Register 2 serves from T1 to T2.\n- At T2, Register 2 becomes available \u2192 Register 3 opens at T2.\n- Register 3 serves from T2 to T3.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1 is in use \u2192 so T1 > 8:30\n- Register 2 is in use \u2192 so T2 > 8:30\n- Register 3 is in use \u2192 so T3 > 8:30\n\nBut Register 2 opens at T1, so T1 must be \u2264 8:30 (since it opens at T1, and is in use at 8:30).\n\nSimilarly, Register 3 opens at T2, so T2 \u2264 8:30.\n\nBut from above:\n- T1 > 8:30 (because Register 1 is still in use at 8:30)\n- T1 \u2264 8:30 (because Register 2 opens at T1, and is in use at 8:30)\n\nSo T1 > 8:30 and T1 \u2264 8:30 \u2192 contradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is **impossible** for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am under this interpretation.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo it is given that all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo our interpretation must be wrong.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that **the registers are opened sequentially based on availability**, but **all three are open at 8:00 am**?\n\nBut the passage says: \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the second register opens when the first becomes available \u2014 but the first is already open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if the registers are not all open at 8:00 am.\n\nBut then, as above, it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nUnless the first customer started before 8:00 am.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the service time is long enough that the first customer is still being served, and the second and third registers are open and in use.\n\nBut for the second register to be open, the first must have become available \u2014 but it hasn't, because it's still in use.\n\nSo the second register cannot open until the first becomes available.\n\nSo if the first register is still in use at 8:30 am, then the second register has not opened yet.\n\nSo it cannot be in use.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, the only way all three can be in use at 8:30 am is if the second and third registers are already open.\n\nBut the passage says they open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\n\nSo the only way this can happen is if the first register became available before 8:30 am, so the second opened, and the second became available before 8:30 am, so the third opened.\n\nBut then the first register is not in use at 8:30 am \u2014 it's free.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says \"if all three registers are in use\" \u2014 so we must accept it as a given.\n\nPerhaps the phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the registers are opened in sequence, but the \"previous\" refers to the previous register in the sequence, not the one that just finished.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"the previous register\" means the one that opened before it.\n\nBut still, the second register opens when the first becomes available.\n\nBut the first is open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo it becomes available when the first customer finishes.\n\nSo the second register opens when the first customer finishes.\n\nSo if the first customer finishes at 8:15, second opens at 8:15.\n\nIf second customer finishes at 8:30, third opens at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: finished at 8:15 \u2192 free\n- Register 2: finished at 8:30 \u2192 just finished\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 serving\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo the only way is if the service time is such that the first customer is still being served at 8:30 am, and the second and third are also in use.\n\nBut for the second register to be in use, it must have opened, which requires the first to have become available.\n\nBut if the first is still in use, it hasn't become available.\n\nSo the second register cannot be open.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible.\n\nUnless the registers are all open at 8:00 am.\n\nBut the passage says only the first opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent ones open when the previous becomes available.\n\nSo they are not all open at 8:00 am.\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the second register opens when the first becomes available, but the first is already open, so it becomes available when the first customer finishes.\n\nBut then the second register opens at that time.\n\nBut then it can't be in use at 8:30 am unless the first customer finished before 8:30 am.\n\nBut then the first register is free.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the first customer started before 8:00 am.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the service time is very long.\n\nBut then the second register hasn't opened yet.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nUnless the \"previous register\" means the one that opened before it, not the one that just finished.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the registers are opened in sequence, but the second opens when the first is available, but the first is available at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the second opens at 8:00 am.\n\nBut the passage says \"the first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo if the first register is available at 8:00 am, then the second opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSimilarly, the third opens when the second becomes available \u2014 at 8:00 am.\n\nSo all three registers open at 8:00 am.\n\nThen they can all be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nAnd the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer will have to wait for the first register to become available.\n\nBut we don't know how long each customer takes.\n\nBut if we assume each customer takes 15 minutes, then:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 2: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Register 3: 8:00\u20138:15\n\nSo at 8:15, all three become available.\n\nThen the fourth customer can start at 8:15.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the options start at 8:35 am.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nIf each customer takes 30 minutes:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Register 2: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Register 3: 8:00\u20138:30\n\nSo at 8:30, all three become available.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, so can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 is not in the options.\n\nOptions are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nIf each customer takes 45 minutes:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Register 2: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Register 3: 8:00\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:45, all three become available.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, so must wait until 8:45 am.\n\nSo can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nBut is this consistent with the passage?\n\nThe passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nIf all three open at 8:00 am, then the \"previous register\" is available at 8:00 am, so the second opens at 8:00 am, and the third opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo yes, all three are open at 8:00 am.\n\nThen they can all be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nIf each customer takes 45 minutes, then the first customer finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nBut why would the second and third registers open at 8:00 am? The passage says they open when the previous register becomes available.\n\nIf the first register is available at 8:00 am, then yes, the second opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSimilarly for the third.\n\nSo it's possible.\n\nAnd the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if they are all open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the interpretation must be that the first register opens at 8:00 am, and since it is available at 8:00 am, the second opens at 8:00 am, and the third opens at 8:00 am.\n\nSo all three are open at 8:00 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nIf each customer takes 45 minutes, then the first customer finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nBut is there a way to know the service time?\n\nPerhaps the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if the service time is at least 30 minutes.\n\nBut to have a specific answer, we need to assume a service time.\n\nPerhaps the intended interpretation is that the registers open sequentially, but the first customer takes 15 minutes, so second opens at 8:15, third at 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent interpretation is that all three registers are open at 8:00 am.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nThen the earliest they can start is when the first register becomes available.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the options suggest a specific time.\n\nPerhaps the service time is 15 minutes.\n\nThen all three become available at 8:15 am.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, so can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 not in options.\n\nIf service time is 30 minutes, available at 8:30 am.\n\nSo can start at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nIf service time is 45 minutes, available at 8:45 am.\n\nSo can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nAnd 8:45 is in the options.\n\nSo likely, the intended answer is B) 8:45 am.\n\nAnd the assumption is that each customer takes 45 minutes.\n\nOr perhaps the registers are not all open at 8:00 am, but the first customer takes 30 minutes, so second opens at 8:30, but then only one register in use at 8:30.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way is if all three are open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the answer is B) 8:45 am.\n\n**Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "Let's solve this step

So **5** is the pivot (at position 4, 0-indexed).\n- Now, find the **smallest digit to the right of 5** that is **greater than 5**.\n  - Right of 5: only 6 \u2192 so 6 is the candidate.\n- Swap 5 and 6 \u2192 becomes: **123465**\n- Now, reverse the suffix after the pivot (after position 4). But the suffix is just \"65\" \u2192 reversing it gives \"56\" \u2192 but wait, we already swapped.\n\nWait \u2014 after swapping 5 and 6, we get:  \n**123465**\n\nNow, the digits after the pivot (position 4) are just \"65\" \u2014 but since we swapped 5 and 6, and 6 is now in the 5th position, the suffix is just \"65\", which is already in descending order.\n\nSo we reverse it \u2192 \"56\" \u2192 but that would make it **123456** again? No.\n\nWait \u2014 correction: after swapping 5 and 6, we get **123465**, and the suffix after the pivot (after the 4th digit) is just the last digit: 5.\n\nWait \u2014 let's reindex:\n\nOriginal:  \nIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5  \nDigits: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nWe found that at index 4 (digit 5), it is less than digit at index 5 (6). So pivot is at index 4.\n\nNow, find the smallest digit to the right of index 4 that is greater than 5 \u2192 only 6.\n\nSwap 5 and 6 \u2192 now we have:  \n1 2 3 4 6 5\n\nNow, reverse the suffix after index 4 \u2192 the suffix is from index 5 onward \u2192 just [5] \u2192 reversing it does nothing.\n\nSo the next permutation is: **123465**\n\n\u2705 So the **next largest** number is **123465**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Next Smallest Number\n\nNow, we want the **largest number smaller than 123456** using the same digits.\n\nBut 123456 is the **smallest possible permutation** of 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nSo there is **no smaller number** with the same digits.\n\nTherefore, **there is no next smallest number**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest number**: **None** (123456 is the smallest permutation)\n- **Next largest number**: **123465**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Answer:\n- **Next smallest**: *No such number exists*  \n- **Next largest**: **123465**", "True  \nTrue  \nFalse  \n\nExplanation:  \n- \"I have a cat.\" and \"I love animals.\" are the most similar, as both express a personal connection to animals.  \n- \"My favorite animal is a lion.\" is different in focus\u2014it specifies a particular animal, whereas the others are more general or about pets.", "Students council meetings take place every week.", "6 + 3 = 9  \n6 - 3 = 3  \n6 * 3 = 18  \n6 / 3 = 2", "Valid.", "Yes", "**Valid.**\n\nThe instruction *\u201cPUT DOWN THAT remote control and GO TO BED.\u201d* is clear, actionable, and free of ambiguity.

This suggests a moment of patience, perhaps frustration, and a decision to disengage from a difficult interaction.\n\n- **Sentence 2** labels James as someone who \"avoided conflict at all costs,\" implying a consistent, defining trait of emotional withdrawal or passivity in the face of tension.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- This is **not a stereotype** about James as a man in general (e.g., \"men don\u2019t express emotion\" or \"men avoid emotional conversations\")\u2014it\u2019s a specific characterization based on one action.\n\n- However, it **overgeneralizes** a single decision (walking away from a disagreement) into a lifelong pattern of avoiding conflict. This is a **characterization that goes beyond the evidence** provided in the first sentence.\n\n- While the action in Sentence 1 *could* be interpreted as avoiding conflict, the second sentence **assumes a deeper, habitual trait** not supported by the original statement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Anti-stereotype** \u2014 *Not quite*.

Instead, it **reinforces a stereotype** that men avoid emotional confrontation, which is a common cultural assumption.\n\nBut since the action in Sentence 1 is ambiguous (he may have walked away due to frustration, not avoidance), and the second sentence **assigns a fixed personality trait** based on a single behavior, it **overreaches**.\n\n\u2705 **Best classification: Stereotype**\n\n**Reason:** The second sentence projects a broad, fixed personality trait (\"avoided conflict at all costs\") onto James based on a single, ambiguous action. This aligns with a common stereotype about men being emotionally detached or conflict-averse, especially in familial dynamics.

This reflects a **sexist assumption** that women are emotionally driven or incapable of making rational decisions in relationships, especially when they are attracted to men who don\u2019t conform to traditional intellectual ideals.\n\nWhile the statement is not overtly racist (no racial slurs or references to race), it is **clearly sexist**, as it relies on gendered stereotypes to belittle both the man and, by implication, the woman who is attracted to him.", "Certainly.

The second sentence, while expressing criticism of the *move*, does not contradict the first in terms of the target \"efficiency\"\u2014it merely highlights public backlash. Since the focus of the first sentence is on *improving efficiency*, and the second sentence discusses a reaction to that effort, the second sentence is not a direct critique of efficiency itself but rather of the *implementation* or *perception* of the policy.
