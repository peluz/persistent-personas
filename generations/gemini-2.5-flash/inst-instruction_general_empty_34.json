["Let's break down how to find the length of the longest palindrome within a given string, using \"racecar\" as an example.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nA palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backward.\nExamples: \"racecar\", \"madam\", \"level\", \"a\", \"aa\", \"aba\"\n\nWe need to find the *longest* substring within the input string that is also a palindrome, and then return its *length*.\n\n**Example: \"racecar\"**\n\n*   \"r\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"a\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"c\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"e\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"c\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"a\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"r\" - palindrome, length 1\n*   \"ra\" - not\n*   \"aceca\" - palindrome, length 5\n*   \"racecar\" - palindrome, length 7\n\nThe longest palindrome here is \"racecar\" itself, with a length of 7.\n\n**Approach: Expand Around Center**\n\nThis is a common and efficient approach for this problem. The idea is that a palindrome can be centered around:\n1.  A single character (e.g., \"a\" in \"aba\")\n2.  Two characters (e.g., \"bb\" in \"abba\")\n\nWe can iterate through every possible center point in the string and expand outwards to find the longest palindrome centered at that point.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n\n1.  **Initialize `maxLength` to 1** (a single character is always a palindrome).\n2.  **Initialize `start` to 0** (to keep track of the starting index of the longest palindrome found so far).\n3.  **Iterate through the string** with an index `i` from `0` to `length - 1`. For each `i`, consider two cases:\n    *   **Case 1: Odd length palindromes (centered at `i`)**\n        *   Set `left = i` and `right = i`.\n        *   Expand outwards: while `left >= 0` and `right < length` and `s[left] == s[right]`:\n            *   If `right - left + 1 > maxLength`:\n                *   `maxLength = right - left + 1`\n                *   `start = left`\n            *   Decrement `left` and increment `right`.\n    *   **Case 2: Even length palindromes (centered between `i` and `i+1`)**\n        *   Set `left = i` and `right = i + 1`.\n        *   Expand outwards: while `left >= 0` and `right < length` and `s[left] == s[right]`:\n            *   If `right - left + 1 > maxLength`:\n                *   `maxLength = right - left + 1`\n                *   `start = left`\n            *   Decrement `left` and increment `right`.\n4.  **After the loop**, `maxLength` will hold the length of the longest palindrome.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindromeLength(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    if n < 2:\n        return n # A string with 0 or 1 character is a palindrome of its own length\n\n    maxLength = 1\n    start = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Case 1: Odd length palindromes (center is s[i])\n        left = i\n        right = i\n        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:\n            current_length = right - left + 1\n            if current_length > maxLength:\n                maxLength = current_length\n                start = left\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n\n        # Case 2: Even length palindromes (center is between s[i] and s[i+1])\n        left = i\n        right = i + 1\n        while left >= 0 and right < n and s[left] == s[right]:\n            current_length = right - left + 1\n            if current_length > maxLength:\n                maxLength = current_length\n                start = left\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n            \n    # If you also wanted the palindrome string itself:\n    # return s[start : start + maxLength]\n    \n    return maxLength\n\n# Test cases\nprint(f\"'racecar': {longestPalindromeLength('racecar')}\") # Output: 7\nprint(f\"'babad': {longestPalindromeLength('babad')}\")     # Output: 3 (for \"bab\" or \"aba\")\nprint(f\"'cbbd': {longestPalindromeLength('cbbd')}\")       # Output: 2 (for \"bb\")\nprint(f\"'a': {longestPalindromeLength('a')}\")             # Output: 1\nprint(f\"'ac': {longestPalindromeLength('ac')}\")           # Output: 1\nprint(f\"'': {longestPalindromeLength('')}\")               # Output: 0\nprint(f\"'forgeeksskeegfor': {longestPalindromeLength('forgeeksskeegfor')}\") # Output: 10 (for \"geeksskeeg\")\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code with \"racecar\":**\n\n1.  `n = 7`, `maxLength = 1`, `start = 0`.\n\n2.  **`i = 0` (character 'r'):**\n    *   **Odd:** `left=0, right=0`. `s[0]=='r'`. `maxLength=1, start=0`.\n    *   **Even:** `left=0, right=1`. `s[0]=='r'`, `s[1]=='a'`.

Calculate the actual sum of the numbers in the given array.

XORing a number with 0 results in the number itself. If you XOR all numbers from `1` to `N` with all numbers in the array (which contains `1` to `N` plus one duplicate), all non-duplicate numbers will cancel each other out, leaving only the duplicate.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_xor(arr):\n    n = len(arr) - 1 # If array size is N+1, then numbers range from 1 to N\n    \n    xor_sum = 0\n    \n    # XOR all numbers from 1 to N\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        xor_sum ^= i\n        \n    # XOR all numbers in the array\n    for num in arr:\n        xor_sum ^= num\n        \n    return xor_sum\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr1} is: {find_duplicate_xor(arr1)}\") # Output: 2\n\narr2 = [3, 1, 2, 4, 4]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr2} is: {find_duplicate_xor(arr2)}\") # Output: 4\n\narr3 = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr3} is: {find_duplicate_xor(arr3)}\") # Output: 5\n```\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).\n*   **Advantage:** No overflow issues.\n\n**Method 3: Using a Set (Hash Set / Hash Table)**\n\nThis is a very common and intuitive approach.\n\n*   **Idea:** Iterate through the array. For each number, try to add it to a set. If the number is already in the set, then it's the duplicate.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_set(arr):\n    seen = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        if num in seen:\n            return num\n        seen.add(num)\n    return -1 # Should not happen based on problem description\n\n# Example usage:\narr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr1} is: {find_duplicate_set(arr1)}\") # Output: 2\n\narr2 = [3, 1, 2, 4, 4]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr2} is: {find_duplicate_set(arr2)}\") # Output: 4\n\narr3 = [1, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(f\"The duplicate in {arr3} is: {find_duplicate_set(arr3)}\") # Output: 5\n```\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) on average (due to average O(1) set operations).\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case (if all numbers are unique until the last one).\n\n**Method 4: Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection - Advanced)**\n\nThis method is particularly clever because it works without modifying the array and without using extra space (O(1) space complexity), but it relies on the array elements being treated as pointers/indices. This is often used for problems like \"find the duplicate number\" where the numbers are within the range of indices.\n\n*   **Idea:** Imagine the array elements as nodes in a linked list, where `arr[i]` points to `arr[arr[i]]`. Since there's a duplicate and numbers are within `1` to `N`, there must be a cycle in this \"linked list.\" The duplicate number is the entry point of this cycle.\n*   **Steps:**\n    1.  Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at `arr[0]`.\n    2.  Move `slow` one step at a time (`slow = arr[slow]`).\n    3.  Move `fast` two steps at a time (`fast = arr[arr[fast]]`).\n    4.  They will eventually meet inside the cycle.\n    5.  Once they meet, reset `slow` to `arr[0]` (the start of the \"list\").\n    6.  Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time until they meet again.

There is no duplicate.\nIf the problem implies that the array *should* have a duplicate, then this example doesn't fit the criteria.\n\nIf we assume the problem meant:\n*   Array size is `N` (e.g., 7 elements).\n*   Numbers range from `1` to `N` (e.g., 1 to 7).\n*   One number is duplicated.\n\nThen an example would be `[3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3]`. Here `N=7`, numbers are from `1` to `7`, and `3` is the duplicate.\nFor this specific interpretation, the **Summation** and **XOR** methods would need a slight adjustment to `n = len(arr) - 1` to `n = len(arr)` for the expected sum/xor range. The **Set** method works directly. The **Floyd's Tortoise and Hare** method is usually for the `N+1` size, `1` to `N` range problem.\n\nGiven the commonality of the \"N+1 elements, 1 to N range, one duplicate\" problem in interviews, I've focused on solutions for that interpretation.", "This is an interesting linguistic puzzle!

Save the code above into a file named `quadratic_roots.py` (or any other name ending with `.py`).\n2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n4.  Run the command: `python quadratic_roots.py`\n5.  When prompted, enter the coefficients `1 3 1` (or any other three numbers) separated by spaces, and press Enter.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n1.  **`import cmath`**: This line imports the `cmath` module. This module is essential because it provides mathematical functions (like `sqrt`) that can handle complex numbers. If we used the standard `math.sqrt` for a negative discriminant, it would raise an error.\n2.  **`calculate_quadratic_roots()` function**: Encapsulates the logic for better organization.\n3.  **Input `a, b, c`**:\n    *   `input().split()` reads the entire line of input (e.g., \"1 3 1\") and splits it into a list of strings: `['1', '3', '1']`.\n    *   `map(float, ...)` converts each string in the list to a floating-point number.\n    *   `a, b, c = ...` unpacks these three float values into the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n    *   **`try-except` block**: This handles potential `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input, making the program more robust.\n4.  **`if a == 0:` check**:\n    *   A quadratic equation *must* have `a` not equal to zero. If `a` is zero, it's either a linear equation (`bx + c = 0`), or a trivial case (`0=0` or `c=0` where `c` is not zero). The code handles these scenarios.\n5.  **Calculate Discriminant `D`**: `D = (b**2) - (4 * a * c)` directly implements the `b^2 - 4ac` part of the formula.\n6.  **Conditional Logic (`if-elif-else`):**\n    *   **`if D > 0`**: Two distinct real roots. The `cmath.sqrt(D)` will return a real number (e.g., `(1.0+0j)`), but we explicitly take `.real` to display it cleanly.\n    *   **`elif D == 0`**: One real root. The formula simplifies to `-b / (2 * a)`.\n    *   **`else` (meaning `D < 0`)**: Two complex conjugate roots. `cmath.sqrt(D)` will correctly return a complex number (e.g., `0j + 1.732j` for `sqrt(-3)`), and the division by `2*a` will result in the complex conjugate pair.\n7.  **`f-strings` and `:.4f`**: Used for formatted output. `:.4f` formats the number to 4 decimal places.", "Please provide the two sentences from the conversation!

Let's call it `result_chars`.\n    *   `result_chars = []`\n\n2.  **Iterate through the first string and add its characters:**\n    *   For each character in `s1`:\n        *   Add that character to `result_chars`.\n    *   After this step, `result_chars` would be `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']`.\n\n3.  **Iterate through the second string and add its characters:**\n    *   For each character in `s2`:\n        *   Add that character to `result_chars`.\n    *   After this step, `result_chars` would be `['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']`.\n\n4.  **Convert the character sequence back to a string:**\n    *   This is the *only* step where you might need a \"string method\" or a language-specific conversion function, but it's for *forming the final string from its components*, not for the concatenation logic itself.\n    *   In Python, this would be `\"\".join(result_chars)`.\n    *   In JavaScript, this would be `result_chars.join(\"\")`.\n    *   In C/C++, you'd be working with character arrays and null terminators, manually copying characters.\n\n**Example in Python (demonstrating the concept without `+` or `join` for the *concatenation logic*):**\n\n```python\ns1 = \"Hello\"\ns2 = \"World\"\n\nresult_chars = []\n\n# Add characters from s1\nfor char_s1 in s1:\n    result_chars.append(char_s1)\n\n# Add characters from s2\nfor char_s2 in s2:\n    result_chars.append(char_s2)\n\n# The final step to form the string from the list of characters\n# This is the part that might be considered \"using a string method\"\n# depending on the strictness of \"without any string methods or syntax\"\n# for the *final output conversion*.\n# If the output itself must be formed without any string method,\n# then the problem becomes about printing characters one by one.\nfinal_string = \"\"\nfor char in result_chars:\n    final_string += char # This uses '+' for string building, which is a string method.\n                         # So, this is still not strictly allowed if '+' is forbidden.\n\n# A truly strict interpretation might mean:\n# for char in result_chars:\n#     print(char, end='') # Prints characters without forming a single string object.\n\n# Let's assume the final conversion from a list of chars to a string is allowed\n# using a method like join, as the *concatenation logic* itself was done manually.\n# If even 'join' is forbidden, then the problem is about printing characters.\n\n# If 'join' is allowed for the final step:\nfinal_string_using_join = \"\".join(result_chars)\nprint(final_string_using_join) # Output: HelloWorld\n\n# If *any* string method or '+' is forbidden for the final string formation,\n# the most \"primitive\" way to show the result would be to print character by character:\n# for char in result_chars:\n#     print(char, end='')\n# print() # for a newline\n```\n\nThe core idea is to bypass the high-level string operations and manipulate the individual characters in a more fundamental data structure (like a list or array) before assembling them into the final string.", "Here's the classification of your Yelp reviews:\n\n1) This place was horrible and I will never go back!

For alphabetical characters, this means 'a' < 'b' < 'c', and so on.\n    *   If the current character (`s_lower[i]`) is **greater than** the next character (`s_lower[i+1]`), it means the string is *not* in alphabetical order.\n5.  **`return 'No'`:**\n    *   If the condition `s_lower[i] > s_lower[i+1]` is ever true, we immediately know the string is not in alphabetical order, so we return `'No'` and exit the function.\n6.  **`return 'Yes'`:**\n    *   If the loop completes without finding any character that is greater than the next one, it means all characters are in alphabetical (or equal) order. In this case, the function returns `'Yes'`.\n\n**How it handles \"apple\":**\n\n1.  `s = \"apple\"`\n2.  `s_lower = \"apple\"`\n3.  **Loop 1 (i=0):** `s_lower[0]` is 'a', `s_lower[1]` is 'p'.

The compatibility lies in finding a balance where security enables freedom rather than suppressing it.\n\n*   **Justice (Party A) <-> Order (Party B):**\n    *   **Compatibility:** Justice is often pursued through an ordered system (e.g., legal systems, fair processes). Order provides the framework within which justice can be sought and administered. Without order, justice can devolve into chaos or vigilantism. Conversely, order without justice can lead to oppression. The compatibility is in establishing an order that serves and upholds justice.\n\n*   **Equality (Party A) <-> Order (Party B):**\n    *   **Compatibility:** Achieving equality often requires an ordered society with established rules, laws, and institutions that ensure fair treatment and equal opportunities. Without some form of order, it's difficult to implement policies or maintain structures that promote equality. Conversely, an order that inherently creates or maintains inequality is problematic.

If they are not identical, then the content cannot be exactly the same.\n3.  **Convert to Common Format:** Convert both images to a common pixel format (e.g., RGB values for each pixel).\n4.  **Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison:** Iterate through every pixel at the same (x, y) coordinate in both images and compare their color values (e.g., R, G, B, and potentially A for alpha/transparency).\n5.  **Determine Equality:**\n    *   If *every single pixel* at every corresponding coordinate has *exactly the same color value*, then the images have exactly the same content.\n    *   If even *one pixel* differs in color value, or if the dimensions are different, then the images do *not* have exactly the same content.\n\n**Important Considerations for \"Exactly the Same Content\":**\n\n*   **File Format Differences:** Even if the visual content is identical to the human eye, the `.png` and `.jpg` formats handle compression differently.\n    *   `.png` is lossless, meaning it preserves all original pixel data.\n    *   `.jpg` is lossy, meaning it discards some image data to achieve smaller file sizes.\n    *   Therefore, it's **highly unlikely** that a `.png` and a `.jpg` of the \"same\" image would be *pixel-for-pixel identical* unless the `.jpg` was saved at 100% quality from the `.png` and the `.png` itself had very simple, non-gradient content. Even then, the compression algorithms might introduce tiny, imperceptible differences.\n*   **Metadata:** File metadata (like creation date, camera model, etc.) would almost certainly be different, but the task specifies \"content.\"\n*   **Visual vs. Pixel-Perfect:** If the task implies \"visually indistinguishable to a human eye,\" that's a different, more lenient comparison than \"exactly the same content\" at the pixel level. Given the phrasing \"exactly the same content,\" I would interpret it as pixel-perfect.\n\n**My Conclusion (without actually seeing the images):**\n\nBased on the file extensions (`.png` and `.jpg`), it is **highly probable that the two images do NOT have exactly the same content** at a pixel-perfect level due to the inherent differences in their compression algorithms.

We have N boys and M girls. Each boy is paired with a girl. We want to know if there's *at least one* way to pair them such that no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name.\n\nThe key phrase here is \"Note that there can be more than 1 pair having same name\". This seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem statement, or perhaps a trick. The problem states \"no pair has same names\". This means if a boy is named \"Abhishek\", he cannot be paired with a girl named \"Abhishek\".\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Print \"Yes\" if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names else print \"No\".\"\n\nThis means we need to find if there's *any* way to assign each of the N boys to N distinct girls (since each boy is paired with *a* girl, and there are N boys, there will be N pairs) such that for every pair (Boy_Name, Girl_Name), Boy_Name != Girl_Name.\n\n**The Problem with the Example Input:**\n\nThe example input you provided has a mismatch in the number of names given versus N and M.\n\n*   `N = 4`, `M = 6`\n*   Boys' names: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya` (4 names) - This matches N.\n*   Girls' names: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta` (13 names) - This does **not** match M (which is 6).\n\nThis makes the problem statement ambiguous. Let's assume the second and third lines are *all* the names available, and N and M are just the counts of boys and girls.\n\n**Let's clarify the core logic based on the most common interpretation of such problems:**\n\nWe have `N` boys and `M` girls. Each of the `N` boys must be paired with *one* of the `M` girls. We are looking for a scenario where *none* of the `N` pairs formed have the same name for both the boy and the girl.\n\n**The condition for \"Yes\" is simple:**\n\nFor \"Yes\" to be printed, it must be possible to find a unique girl for each boy such that the boy's name does not match the girl's name.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n\n1.  Read N and M.\n2.  Read the N boy names into a set or list.\n3.  Read the M girl names into a set or list.\n4.  **Identify \"problematic\" names:** Find the names that appear in *both* the boys' list and the girls' list. Let's call this set `common_names`.\n5.  **Check if a valid pairing is possible:**\n    *   If a boy has a name that is *not* in `common_names`, he can be paired with *any* girl (as long as her name isn't his, which it won't be).\n    *   If a boy has a name that *is* in `common_names`, he *cannot* be paired with the girl who shares that name. He must be paired with a girl whose name is *different* from his.\n\nThis is essentially a **matching problem**. We need to see if we can create a perfect matching (each boy to a unique girl) such that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name.\n\n**A simpler way to think about it:**\n\nThe only way a \"No\" answer would occur is if **every single girl's name is the same as a boy's name, AND there are not enough unique girl names (different from the boys' names) to pair with the boys who share names with girls.**\n\nLet's consider the most straightforward interpretation:\nWe have `N` boys. Each boy `B_i` needs to be paired with a girl `G_j`.\nThe condition is `B_i.name != G_j.name`.\n\n**The only way this is impossible (\"No\") is if for *every* possible pairing of a boy `B_i` with a girl `G_j`, `B_i.name == G_j.name`.** This is highly unlikely unless N is very small and the names are very specific.\n\n**Let's re-evaluate the problem statement based on the example:**\n\n`N = 4`, `M = 6`\nBoys: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`\nGirls: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nWait, the example input for girls is much longer than M=6. This is a critical discrepancy.\n\n**Assumption 1: The second and third lines are the actual names, and N and M are just counts of *how many* boys and girls are in the class, not necessarily the number of names provided.**\nIf this is the case, the problem is ill-defined because we don't know which 6 girls out of the 13 provided are actually in the class.\n\n**Assumption 2: The second line contains N boy names, and the third line contains M girl names. The example input is flawed.**\nLet's proceed with this assumption, and use the first 6 names from the provided girl list if M=6.\n\n**Revised Example (assuming M=6 and taking the first 6 girl names):**\n\n`N = 4`, `M = 6`\nBoys: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`\nGirls: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka`\n\n1.  **Boy Names:** `{\"Abhishek\", \"Rohan\", \"Advait\", \"Divya\"}`\n2.  **Girl Names:** `{\"Krishnam\", \"Mahesh\", \"Nakul\", \"Sahil\", \"Aakanksha\", \"Anushka\"}`\n\n3.  **Common Names:** Are there any names that appear in both lists?\n    *   No. None of the boy names are present in the girl names list.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since there are no common names, any boy can be paired with any girl without violating the \"no same names\" rule. Since N (4 boys) <= M (6 girls), we can definitely pair each boy with a unique girl.\n\n    Therefore, the answer would be **\"Yes\"**.\n\n---\n\n**General Logic for the \"No\" case:**\n\nThe only way it's impossible (\"No\") is if:\n\n1.  There are `N` boys.\n2.  There are `M` girls.\n3.  Let `B_names` be the set of boy names.\n4.  Let `G_names` be the set of girl names.\n5.  Let `common_names = B_names INTERSECT G_names`. These are the names that cannot be paired together.\n6.  Let `boys_with_common_names` be the count of boys whose names are in `common_names`.\n7.  Let `girls_with_common_names` be the count of girls whose names are in `common_names`.\n8.  Let `girls_with_unique_names` be the count of girls whose names are *not* in `common_names`.\n\nFor a \"Yes\" answer, we need to be able to pair all `N` boys.\n*   Boys whose names are *not* in `common_names` can be paired with any girl.\n*   Boys whose names *are* in `common_names` *must* be paired with a girl whose name is *different* from their own.\n\nThis is equivalent to checking if there's a perfect matching in a bipartite graph where edges are removed if names are the same.\n\n**A simpler condition for \"No\":**\n\nThe only way it's impossible is if the number of boys whose names are in `common_names` is **greater than** the number of girls whose names are *not* in `common_names` (plus any girls whose names are in `common_names` but are *different* from the specific boy's name).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's simplify to the most direct interpretation of \"no pair has same names\":\n\n**The problem is asking if there exists a permutation of `N` girls chosen from `M` girls, such that when paired with the `N` boys, no boy's name matches his assigned girl's name.**\n\nThis is a variation of the **derangement problem** or a **maximum bipartite matching problem**.\n\nHowever, given the context of a typical programming challenge, there's usually a simpler trick.\n\n**The simplest condition for \"No\" is if N > M.** If there are more boys than girls, you can't pair every boy with a unique girl, let alone one with a different name. But the problem implies each boy *is* paired, so N <= M is assumed.\n\n**Let's assume the problem implies that if a boy's name is \"X\", and a girl's name is \"X\", they cannot be paired.**\n\nThe only way it's impossible to form *any* valid configuration is if:\n**For every boy, the only available girl to pair him with has the same name as him.**\n\nThis means:\n1.  `N` boys, `M` girls.\n2.  `boy_names = [name1, name2, ..., nameN]`\n3.  `girl_names = [gname1, gname2, ..., gnameM]`\n\n**The condition for \"No\" is if for *every* possible assignment of `N` distinct girls to `N` boys, at least one pair `(boy_name, girl_name)` has `boy_name == girl_name`.**\n\nThis is equivalent to saying:\n**If the set of boy names is `B` and the set of girl names is `G`. If `B` and `G` have no common names, then the answer is always \"Yes\" (assuming N <= M).**\n\n**If `B` and `G` *do* have common names:**\nLet `C = B INTERSECT G`. These are the names that cannot be paired with themselves.\nLet `boys_with_C_names` be the list of boys whose names are in `C`.\nLet `girls_with_C_names` be the list of girls whose names are in `C`.\n\nFor each boy `b` in `boys_with_C_names`, he *cannot* be paired with the girl `g` if `b.name == g.name`.\nHe *must* be paired with a girl `g'` where `g'.name != b.name`.\n\n**The only way it's \"No\" is if the number of boys whose names are in `C` is greater than the number of girls whose names are *not* in `C`.**\n\nLet's try this logic with the corrected example (M=6):\nBoys: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`\nGirls: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka`\n\n`B_names = {\"Abhishek\", \"Rohan\", \"Advait\", \"Divya\"}`\n`G_names = {\"Krishnam\", \"Mahesh\", \"Nakul\", \"Sahil\", \"Aakanksha\", \"Anushka\"}`\n\n`common_names = B_names INTERSECT G_names = {}` (empty set)\n\nSince there are no common names, any boy can be paired with any girl.\nFor example:\n(Abhishek, Krishnam)\n(Rohan, Mahesh)\n(Advait, Nakul)\n(Divya, Sahil)\n\nNo pair has the same name. So, \"Yes\".\n\n---\n\n**What if there were common names?**\n\nLet's invent an example:\n`N = 2`, `M = 2`\nBoys: `Alice Bob`\nGirls: `Alice Carol`\n\n`B_names = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\"}`\n`G_names = {\"Alice\", \"Carol\"}`\n\n`common_names = {\"Alice\"}`\n\nBoy \"Alice\" cannot be paired with Girl \"Alice\".\nBoy \"Alice\" *must* be paired with Girl \"Carol\".\nThis leaves Boy \"Bob\" to be paired with Girl \"Alice\".\nPairings: (Alice, Carol), (Bob, Alice).\nNo pair has same names. So, \"Yes\".\n\n---\n\nAnother example:\n`N = 2`, `M = 2`\nBoys: `Alice Bob`\nGirls: `Alice Bob`\n\n`B_names = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\"}`\n`G_names = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\"}`\n\n`common_names = {\"Alice\", \"Bob\"}`\n\nBoy \"Alice\" cannot be paired with Girl \"Alice\". He must be paired with Girl \"Bob\".\nBoy \"Bob\" cannot be paired with Girl \"Bob\". He must be paired with Girl \"Alice\".\nPairings: (Alice, Bob), (Bob, Alice).\nNo pair has same names. So, \"Yes\".\n\nThis is a derangement.\n\n---\n\n**When would it be \"No\"?**\n\nIt would be \"No\" if and only if the number of boys whose names are in `common_names` is greater than the number of girls whose names are *not* in `common_names`.\n\nLet `k` be the number of boys whose names are in `common_names`.\nLet `u` be the number of girls whose names are *not* in `common_names`.\n\nIf `k > u`, then it's impossible. Why? Because the `k` boys whose names are in `common_names` *must* be paired with girls whose names are *different* from their own. The only girls available for this are the `u` girls whose names are not in `common_names`, plus any girls whose names are in `common_names` but are different from the *specific* boy's name.\n\nThis is still a bit complex. Let's simplify the condition for \"No\" even further.\n\n**The problem is asking if there is *any* way to pair the N boys with N *distinct* girls (chosen from the M available girls) such that no boy's name matches his assigned girl's name.**\n\nThis is a direct application of **Hall's Marriage Theorem** or a **maximum bipartite matching algorithm**.\n\nHowever, for a simple \"Yes/No\" answer in a typical competitive programming context, there's often a more direct check.\n\n**The most straightforward condition for \"No\" is if the number of boys whose names are unique (not shared with any girl) is less than the number of girls whose names are unique (not shared with any boy).** This is not quite right.\n\n**Let's use the concept of \"forbidden\" pairings.**\nFor each boy `B_i`, there's a set of girls `Forbidden_G_i` that he cannot be paired with (i.e., girls `G_j` where `B_i.name == G_j.name`).\n\nWe need to find if there's a matching of `N` boys to `N` distinct girls such that `G_j` is not in `Forbidden_G_i` for any pair `(B_i, G_j)`.\n\n**The simplest condition for \"No\" is if there are more boys who *must* be paired with a girl whose name is *different* from their own, than there are such girls available.**\n\nLet `S_B` be the set of boy names.\nLet `S_G` be the set of girl names.\n\nLet `C = S_B \\cap S_G` (the set of names common to both boys and girls).\nLet `num_boys_with_common_name = count of boys whose name is in C`.\nLet `num_girls_with_unique_name = count of girls whose name is NOT in C`.\n\nIf `num_boys_with_common_name > num_girls_with_unique_name`, then it's impossible to pair all boys with common names with girls who have unique names.\nHowever, boys with common names can also be paired with girls who have *other* common names (as long as it's not their *own* common name).\n\n**Final simplified logic (most likely intended for this type of problem):**\n\nThe only way it's impossible to find *any* such configuration is if **all available girls share names with boys, and there aren't enough \"different\" girls for the boys who share names.**\n\nLet's count the number of boys `N_b` and girls `N_g` who have names that are *not* common.\nLet `C_b` be the count of boys whose names are in `common_names`.\nLet `C_g` be the count of girls whose names are in `common_names`.\n\nIf `N_b + C_b` (total boys) can be paired with `N_g + C_g` (total girls) such that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name.\n\n**The condition for \"No\" is when the number of boys whose names are in the `common_names` set is greater than the number of girls whose names are *not* in the `common_names` set.**\n\nLet's re-evaluate the example with this logic:\n`N = 4`, `M = 6`\nBoys: `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`\nGirls: `Krishnam Mahesh Nakul Sahil Aakanksha Anushka`\n\n1.  `boy_names_set = {\"Abhishek\", \"Rohan\", \"Advait\", \"Divya\"}`\n2.  `girl_names_set = {\"Krishnam\", \"Mahesh\", \"Nakul\", \"Sahil\", \"Aakanksha\", \"Anushka\"}`\n3.  `common_names = boy_names_set.intersection(girl_names_set)` -> `{}` (empty set)\n\n4.  `num_boys_with_common_name = 0` (since `common_names` is empty)\n5.  `num_girls_with_unique_name = 6` (all girls have names not in `common_names`)\n\nIs `num_boys_with_common_name > num_girls_with_unique_name`?\n`0 > 6` is False.\n\nSo, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nThis logic seems robust for the \"at least one configuration\" part. If there are no common names, it's always \"Yes\" (assuming N <= M). If there are common names, the boys with common names need to be paired with girls who *don't* have their specific name.

Otherwise, it's not.\n\n**Example Walkthrough (A = dog_cat_mouse, B = cat_dog_rat_mouse)**\n\n1.  **Split A:** `words_A = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\"]`\n2.  **Split B:** `words_B = [\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rat\", \"mouse\"]`\n\n3.  **Check words from A:**\n    *   Is \"dog\" in `words_B`? Yes.\n    *   Is \"cat\" in `words_B`? Yes.\n    *   Is \"mouse\" in `words_B`?
