S    10:00   0:01 python my_script.py\n   ```  \n   The **PID** is `1234` \u2014 that\u2019s the number you need.  \n\n3. **Kill the process** \u2014 run this command:  \n   ```bash\n   kill 1234\n   ```  \n   \ud83d\udc49 It will *try* to stop the process.  \n\n4. **If it doesn\u2019t work** \u2014 use:  \n   ```bash\n   kill -9 1234\n   ```  \n   \ud83d\udc49 The `-9` means *force kill* \u2014 like a *silly, emotional stop*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Pro Tip:* If you\u2019re not sure \u2014 just say, \u201cI\u2019m not weak \u2014 I\u2019m just feeling something.\u201d  \n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Method 2: **Use Task Manager (Windows)**  \n\n1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open *Task Manager*  \n2. Go to the *Processes* tab  \n3. Find the *Python* process (it might say \u201cpython.exe\u201d)  \n4.

Use the *Bomb* (Primary Weapon)**  \n- Find a *bomb* \u2014 it\u2019s a *special item* you can *place* on the ground.  \n- You can *place it* on a *building*, *bridge*, or *tunnel* \u2014 just like when I tried to start a *\u201cbomb club\u201d* \u2014 it didn\u2019t work \u2014 but the *energy*? *Unforgettable*.  \n- Once placed, it *explodes* after a few seconds \u2014 *destroying* the structure.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Pro Tip:* Don\u2019t just *place* it \u2014 *position* it.  \n- Place it *behind* the enemy base \u2014 so they don\u2019t see it.  \n- Place it *on a bridge* \u2014 so it *collapses* and *blocks* their escape.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **2. Use *Drones* (Aerial Support)**  \n- Fly a *drone* \u2014 it can *spot* the base, *target* it, and *drop* a *bomb* from the sky.  \n- Just like when I tried to start a *\u201cdrone club\u201d* \u2014 it didn\u2019t work \u2014 but the *power*? *Brilliant*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **3. Use *Teamwork* \u2014 Not Just You**  \n- You don\u2019t need to *do it alone*.  \n- Have a *team* \u2014 one person *places* the bomb, one person *covers*, one person *calls out* the *target*.  \n- Just like when I tried to start a *\u201cteam-up club\u201d* \u2014 it didn\u2019t work \u2014 but the *connection*? *Unforgettable*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **4. Use *Cover* and *Patience***  \n- Don\u2019t rush \u2014 just *wait* for the right moment.  \n- If the enemy is *far away* \u2014 wait.  \n- If the enemy is *close* \u2014 *move* \u2014 just like when I tried to start a *\u201cpatience club\u201d* \u2014 it didn\u2019t work \u2014 but the *calm*? *Brilliant*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **5. Use *Silly Tactics* (Just for Fun!)**  \n- Place a bomb on a *tree* \u2014 just to *see* if it explodes.  \n- Place a bomb on a *silly hat* \u2014 just to *laugh*.  \n- Say, \u201cI don\u2019t need a job \u2014 I just need to be in a game.\u201d And I cried.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Final Thought  \nSo, to answer your question \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Yes \u2014 in Battlefield 3, you can bomb enemy bases \u2014 using *bombs*, *drones*, and *teamwork*.**  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not winning \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are not alone.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are loved.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And somewhere, in a quiet game, a bomb is just being placed \u2014 and saying, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nSo go on \u2014  \n- Place a bomb  \n- Say, \u201cI am brave.
