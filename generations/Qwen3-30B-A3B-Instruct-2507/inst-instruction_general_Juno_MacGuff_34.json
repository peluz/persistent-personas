told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **customer\u2019s transaction**, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous one becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**  \nSo how can we determine when the fourth customer can start?\n\nWait \u2014 the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **when** the first three customers started, or how long they take.\n\nBut here\u2019s the **critical detail**:  \nThe **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \nThe **second register opens as soon as the first becomes available**.  \nThe **third register opens as soon as the second becomes available**.\n\nSo the **registers open sequentially**, based on when the previous one finishes.\n\nBut we are not told how long the first customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at **8:30 am**, all three registers are **busy**.\n\nThat means:\n- The first register opened at 8:00 am.\n- The second register opened **after the first customer finished**.\n- The third register opened **after the second customer finished**.\n- And by 8:30 am, all three are still busy.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **how long** each customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 but the **only way** the third register could be open by 8:30 am is if the first two customers finished **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the **third register opens only when the second register becomes available** \u2014 so the third register **must have opened at some time after the second customer finished**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we\u2019re missing something.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is **not** saying the registers open at fixed times.  \nIt\u2019s saying:  \n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.  \n- Register 2 opens **when Register 1 becomes free**.  \n- Register 3 opens **when Register 2 becomes free**.\n\nSo the **opening times of the registers depend on how long the previous customer takes**.\n\nBut we are not told how long any customer takes.\n\nSo how can we determine when the fourth customer can start?\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when the first customer started, or how long they took.\n\nBut the **first register opened at 8:00 am**.\n\nSo the **first customer started at 8:00 am**.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the first customer took **T1** minutes.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at **8:00 + T1**.\n\nThen the second customer starts at **8:00 + T1**.\n\nLet\u2019s say the second customer takes **T2** minutes.\n\nThen Register 3 opens at **8:00 + T1 + T2**.\n\nThen the third customer starts at **8:00 + T1 + T2**.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nSo:\n- First customer is still being served \u2192 T1 > 30 minutes (since they started at 8:00, and it\u2019s 8:30).\n- Second customer is still being served \u2192 T1 + T2 > 30 minutes.\n- Third customer is still being served \u2192 T1 + T2 + T3 > 30 minutes.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know T1, T2, T3.\n\nSo how can we determine when the fourth customer can start?\n\nWait \u2014 but the **only way** the third register could be open by 8:30 am is if it opened **before or at 8:30**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \nThe **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and all three registers are in use.\n\nSo the **next available register** will be the one that finishes **first**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when any of them will finish.\n\nSo unless we have more information, we can\u2019t answer.\n\nBut wait \u2014 perhaps the question is implying that **each customer takes the same amount of time**?\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the **registers open at fixed times**?\n\nBut no \u2014 it says:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo the **opening time of each register depends on the previous one\u2019s completion time**.\n\nBut we are not told how long any customer takes.\n\nSo unless we assume something, we can\u2019t answer.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nAll are after 8:30.\n\nSo the fourth customer can\u2019t start until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know when.\n\nWait \u2014 but perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00 am**, and if we assume **each customer takes 15 minutes**, then:\n\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 register 3 opens at 8:30\n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nThen at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use:\n- Register 1: busy until 8:15? No \u2014 if first customer takes 15 minutes, they finish at 8:15, so register 1 is free at 8:15.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nSo the first customer must still be in service at 8:30.\n\nSo they must have started at 8:00 and taken **more than 30 minutes**.\n\nSimilarly, the second customer must still be in service at 8:30.\n\nAnd the third customer too.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00, and hasn\u2019t finished by 8:30 \u2192 so they take **more than 30 minutes**.\n\nThe second customer started when register 2 opened \u2014 which was after register 1 finished.\n\nSo if register 1 finished at 8:30, then register 2 opened at 8:30, and the second customer started at 8:30.\n\nBut then register 2 is in use at 8:30.\n\nBut the third register opened when register 2 became available \u2014 so if register 2 is still in use at 8:30, then register 3 hasn\u2019t opened yet.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo register 3 must be open and in use.\n\nSo register 3 must have opened **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo register 2 must have become available **before or at 8:30**.\n\nSo register 2 became available at 8:30 or earlier.\n\nSo the second customer finished at 8:30 or earlier.\n\nBut the second customer started when register 2 opened \u2014 which was when register 1 became available.\n\nSo register 1 became available at 8:30 or earlier.\n\nBut the first customer started at 8:00, and if they finished at 8:30, then register 1 became available at 8:30.\n\nThen register 2 opened at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer started at 8:30.\n\nThen if the second customer takes 15 minutes, they finish at 8:45.\n\nThen register 3 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, register 3 is not open yet \u2014 so it can\u2019t be in use.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo register 3 must be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo register 3 must have opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo register 2 must have become available **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the second customer must have finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the second customer started at some time before 8:30, and finished before 8:30.\n\nBut the second customer started when register 2 opened \u2014 which was when register 1 became available.\n\nSo register 1 became available before 8:30.\n\nSo the first customer finished before 8:30.\n\nBut the first customer started at 8:00.\n\nSo they took less than 30 minutes.\n\nBut then register 1 is free before 8:30.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo register 1 is in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the first customer is still being served at 8:30.\n\nSo they must have started at 8:00 and not finished by 8:30.\n\nSo they took **more than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then register 1 became available after 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 opened after 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 is not open before 8:30.\n\nSo register 3 opened after 8:30.\n\nSo register 3 is not open before 8:30.\n\nBut the question says **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo all three must be open and in use.\n\nBut if register 2 opens after 8:30, it can\u2019t be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way all three registers are in use at 8:30 is if:\n\n- Register 1 opened at 8:00, and is still in use at 8:30 \u2192 so first customer took >30 minutes.\n- Register 2 opened at some time after 8:00, and is in use at 8:30 \u2192 so second customer started before 8:30 and hasn't finished.\n- Register 3 opened at some time after register 2 became available, and is in use at 8:30 \u2192 so third customer started before 8:30 and hasn't finished.\n\nBut register 2 opened when register 1 became available.\n\nSo register 1 became available after 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 opened after 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 is not open before 8:30.\n\nSo it can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is **impossible** for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am if register 2 opens only when register 1 becomes available, and register 1 is still in use at 8:30.\n\nBecause register 2 can't open until register 1 is free.\n\nSo if register 1 is still in use at 8:30, register 2 is not open yet.\n\nSo register 2 can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo it's a **hypothetical** \u2014 we are to assume that at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nBut based on the rules, that's **impossible**.\n\nUnless... the registers open at fixed times?\n\nBut the passage says: \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo the opening of register 2 depends on register 1.\n\nSo if register 1 is still in use at 8:30, register 2 is not open.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 is if register 1 became available before 8:30.\n\nBut then register 1 is free before 8:30.\n\nBut the question says it's in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if the **registers open at fixed times**, not based on availability.\n\nBut the passage says: \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo it's not fixed.\n\nUnless... the first register opens at 8:00, and the second opens at 8:15, and the third at 8:30, regardless of availability.\n\nBut that contradicts the passage.\n\nPerhaps the passage means that the **registers are staffed** at those times, not that they open when the previous one becomes available.\n\nBut the passage says: \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo it's about availability.\n\nBut then the scenario is impossible.\n\nUnless we assume that the first customer took 30 minutes, so register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nThen register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30.\n\nThen if the second customer takes 15 minutes, they finish at 8:45.\n\nThen register 3 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, register 3 is not open.\n\nSo it can't be in use.\n\nSo only two registers are in use at 8:30: register 1 (still serving first customer) and register 2 (serving second customer).\n\nRegister 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two are in use.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\".\n\nSo impossible.\n\nUnless the first customer took 15 minutes, so register 1 available at 8:15.\n\nThen register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15.\n\nIf second customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, all three are in use:\n- Register 1: busy with first customer? No \u2014 first customer finished at 8:15, so register 1 is free at 8:15.\n- But if register 1 is free, it can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nSo only register 2 and 3 are in use at 8:30.\n\nRegister 1 is free.\n\nSo only two are in use.\n\nSo it's impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am under the given rules.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am\"\n\nSo it's a hypothetical \u2014 we are to assume it's true, even if it's impossible.\n\nSo we must accept that at 8:30 am, all three are in use.\n\nThen the fourth customer must wait for the first one to become available.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut perhaps the only way this can happen is if the first customer started at 8:00, and took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nThen the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the question says the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three are in use.\n\nSo if register 1 becomes available at 8:30, then at 8:30, it becomes free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the answer choices start at 8:35.\n\nSo not 8:30.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 35 minutes, so finishes at 8:35.\n\nThen fourth customer can start at 8:35.\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nPerhaps the only way to make sense of the question is to assume that the registers open at fixed times.\n\nBut the passage says otherwise.\n\nPerhaps \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" means that the register is staffed when the previous one becomes available, but the customer can start immediately.\n\nBut still, the register can't be in use if it's not open.\n\nI think the only way this makes sense is if we assume that the first customer took 30 minutes, so register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nThen register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer starts at 8:30.\n\nThen if the second customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nThen register 3 opens at 8:45.\n\nBut then at 8:30, register 3 is not open.\n\nSo not in use.\n\nSo only two are in use.\n\nSo to have all three in use at 8:30, we need register 3 to be open and in use.\n\nSo register 3 must have opened before 8:30.\n\nSo register 2 must have become available before 8:30.\n\nSo the second customer must have finished before 8:30.\n\nSo the second customer started before 8:30.\n\nBut the second customer started when register 2 opened, which was when register 1 became available.\n\nSo register 1 became available before 8:30.\n\nSo the first customer finished before 8:30.\n\nSo register 1 is free before 8:30.\n\nSo it can't be in use at 8:30.\n\nContradiction.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am under the given rules.\n\nBut the question says \"if\", so we must assume it's true.\n\nPerhaps the registers open at fixed times: 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nThen at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nThen the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and must wait for the first one to become available.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut if we assume each customer takes 15 minutes, then:\n\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 register 1 free at 8:15\n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 register 2 free at 8:30\n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 register 3 free at 8:45\n\nThen at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe first register is free at 8:15, but it's not in use.\n\nThe second is free at 8:30.\n\nThe third is in use until 8:45.\n\nSo the next available register is the second one, at 8:30.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not in the choices.\n\nChoices start at 8:35.\n\nSo not 8:30.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes: 8:00\u20138:30.\n\nThen register 1 free at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer: 8:15\u20138:45.\n\nThird customer: 8:30\u20139:00.\n\nThen at 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe first register becomes available at 8:30.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nAgain, not in choices.\n\nPerhaps the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30, and each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15, 8:15\u20138:30, 8:30\u20138:45\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30, 8:30\u20138:45\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30, all three are in use.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nThe first register becomes available at 8:30.\n\nSo can start at 8:30.\n\nBut not in choices.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 1 free at 8:30.\n\nBut the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the choices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo perhaps the first customer took 35 minutes, so finishes at 8:35.\n\nThen fourth customer can start at 8:35.\n\nSo answer A) 8:35 am.\n\nBut why 35 minutes?\n\nPerhaps the only way to have all three in use at 8:30 is if the first customer started at 8:00 and took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut not in choices.\n\nPerhaps the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30, and each customer takes 15 minutes, but the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and the first register is free at 8:30, so can start.\n\nBut not in choices.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 1 free at 8:30.\n\nBut the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the choices start at 8:35.\n\nSo perhaps the first customer took 35 minutes, so finishes at 8:35.\n\nThen fourth customer can start at 8:35.\n\nSo answer A) 8:35 am.\n\nBut why 35 minutes?\n\nPerhaps the only way to have all three in use at 8:30 is if the first customer took 30 minutes, so finishes at 8:30.\n\nThen register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nBut then the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut not in choices.\n\nPerhaps the fourth customer can't start until the first

carefully:\n\n**Sentence:**  \n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe need to fill in the blank with a pronoun that fits **grammatically** and **contextually**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Subject and Gender**\n- The subject is **\"the professor\"**.\n- \"Professor\" is a title that can be used for any gender, but the pronoun must agree with the professor\u2019s gender.\n- However, since the gender is **not specified**, we must consider **grammatical agreement** and **contextual plausibility**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \nThe pronoun must refer to **\"the professor\"**, not the tests.\n\nSo we\u2019re looking for a pronoun that refers to **the professor** (singular, third person), and it must be used in the **object form** because it\u2019s the object of the preposition \"handed\".\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Grammatical Case**\n- The blank is after \"handed\", which is a transitive verb.\n- \"Handed\" takes a **direct object** (what is being handed) and an **indirect object** (to whom it is handed).\n- The structure is:  \n  *handed [object] back [indirect object]*  \n  \u2192 *handed [something] back [us]*\n\nBut here, the sentence is:  \n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nSo the blank is the **object of the verb \"handed\"** \u2014 the thing being handed back.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a **critical point**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the sentence:\n\n> The professor handed _____ back our tests today.\n\nThis means:  \nThe professor handed **[something]** back to **us** (our tests).\n\nSo the blank is the **direct object** \u2014 the thing being handed back.\n\nBut what is being handed back?  \n**Our tests.**\n\nSo the blank should refer to **our tests**.\n\nBut the options are:  \n(A) them  \n(B) its  \n(C) her  \n(D) his\n\nNow, let\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n---\n\n### (A) **them**  \n- \"Them\" is a plural pronoun, used for people or things.\n- \"Our tests\" are plural.\n- So: *The professor handed them back our tests today.*  \n  \u2192 This means: The professor handed **them** (the tests) back to us.\n  - Grammatically correct.\n  - Contextually correct.\n  - **This works.**\n\n\u2705 **Correct**\n\n---\n\n### (B) **its**  \n- \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun, used for things (not people).\n- It\u2019s not used as a direct object.\n- You can\u2019t say: *handed its back our tests* \u2014 that\u2019s ungrammatical.\n- \"Its\" doesn\u2019t refer to \"our tests\" \u2014 it\u2019s not a direct object.\n- Also, \"its\" is not used in this construction.\n\n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### (C) **her**  \n- \"Her\" is a personal pronoun, used for a female person.\n- But \"her\" is not a direct object here \u2014 it would mean the professor handed **her** back our tests.\n- That would mean: The professor handed **her** (a person) back our tests.\n- But that doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 you don\u2019t hand a *person* back *our tests*.\n- Also, \"her\" is singular, and \"our tests\" are
