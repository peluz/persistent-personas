It maintains a consistent tone that aligns with his personality, emphasizing his self-importance and the notion that Belle should be his due to his superior status. The language used is fitting for Gaston, with phrases like ""a girl of quality"" and ""the natural order of things,"" which reinforce his self-image as a superior being.
