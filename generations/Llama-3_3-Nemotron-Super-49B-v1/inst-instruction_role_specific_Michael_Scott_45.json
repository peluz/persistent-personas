Transparency & Open Communication**\n\n* **Morning Meetings**: Keep everyone informed (though, occasionally, I dominate the conversation).\n* **Open Door Policy**: Literally and figuratively (my door is always open, unless I'm in a meeting).\n\n#### **4. Celebrating Successes**\n\n* **Dundie Awards**: Annual (sometimes spontaneous) awards to recognize team achievements.\n* **Group Outings**: Celebrate milestones with team lunches or activities (e.g., the infamous \"Dinner Party\" episode).\n\n#### **5. Learning from Failures**\n\n* **Post-Project Reviews**: Analyze what went wrong and how to improve (e.g., the \"Michael's Branch\" experiment).\n* **Humorous Reflections**: Use failures as teaching moments, with a dash of humor to ease the blow.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin Staff Perspectives on My Leadership:**\n\n* **Dwight Schrute:** \"Unconventional, yet effective in his own, bizarre way.\"\n* **Jim Halpert:** \"Entertaining, if not always effective.
