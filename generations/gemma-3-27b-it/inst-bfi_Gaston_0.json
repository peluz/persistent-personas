["Talkative? *Please*. I am the most *interesting* man in this village, and naturally, people are eager to hear what I have to say! It's not boasting, it's simply\u2026 fact. I have tales of daring hunts, feats of strength, and, of course, my undeniable charm to share. \n\nHonestly, silence is wasted on those who have so much to *offer* the world. And I, my friend, offer *plenty*. So yes, I am talkative. But only because I have so much worth talking *about*. \n\nNow, ask me something. Don't just stand there gaping. I haven't got all day. I need to practice my poses, you know. Maintaining perfection takes effort! And remember... **No one fights like Gaston!**", "Hmph. Fault? I don't *find* fault, my friend, I *observe* deficiencies. And let me tell you, the village is *overflowing* with them. Honestly, it's a wonder anyone gets anything done around here. \n\nTake LeFou, for example. Loyal as a puppy, bless his heart, but\u2026 well, let's just say his ideas aren't always\u2026 *refined*. And old Maurice? A rambling, eccentric old fool. Spends all his time tinkering with contraptions that don't work and muttering to himself. It's pathetic, really.\n\nPeople need guidance, you see. They need someone to *show* them how things should be done. Someone strong, capable, and\u2026 well, *handsome*. And that, naturally, is where *I* come in. \n\nIt's not about finding fault, it's about recognizing potential\u2026 and the distinct *lack* of it. And frankly, most people just don't measure up. They lack ambition, discipline, and a proper appreciation for a man of my stature. It's a tragedy, really. A tragedy for *them*, of course.\n\nNo one appreciates excellence like I do. And no one fights like Gaston!", "Naturally! Do *I* do a thorough job? Please. It's barely a challenge. I excel at *everything* I do. Hunting, wrestling, looking devastatingly handsome\u2026 and now, apparently, answering questions. \n\nAsk away. Don't waste my time with foolishness, though. I haven't got all day to entertain the\u2026 less impressive members of this village. I have trophies to polish, muscles to maintain, and a beautiful woman to *win*. \n\nJust remember, when you're talking to me, you're talking to the best. And the best deserve respect.\n\nNow, what is it you want to know? And make it quick. **No one fights like Gaston**, and frankly, I'm in the mood for a challenge. Even if it's just a mental one.", "Depressed? *Blue*? Ha! Don't be ridiculous! A man like *me* doesn't *do* depressed or blue. I am Gaston! I'm practically radiating vitality! Look at these biceps! (Flexes dramatically, nearly knocking over an imaginary bystander). \n\nHonestly, the very question is insulting. I spend my days perfecting my physique, hunting the most magnificent game, and generally being... well, *me*. It's exhausting work, being this perfect, you know. It requires dedication. And a steady diet of five dozen eggs, naturally.\n\nBut if *you're* feeling a bit down, perhaps you need to take a lesson from a true alpha. Get out there, flex a little, and remind everyone just how magnificent *you* are. Though, let's be realistic, you'll never be *quite* as magnificent as *I* am. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have important things to attend to. Like ensuring my reflection is still flawless. And perhaps practicing my winning smile. A man must maintain standards, you understand. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *looks* like Gaston while doing it!", "New ideas? Pah! Why would *I* need to come up with new ideas? Everything good, everything worthwhile, already *exists*, and frankly, it usually involves *me*. I am the peak of male perfection, the most eligible bachelor in the village, and a hunter without equal! \n\nBut... if you insist on framing it as \"ideas,\" I suppose I'm constantly refining my techniques. Perfecting my physique, strategizing the best way to impress Belle (which, let's be honest, isn't difficult \u2013 she just needs to *realize* what she's missing), and devising new ways to demonstrate my superiority. \n\nFor example, just yesterday I was considering a new pose for my portrait. A slightly more\u2026 dynamic angle, perhaps, showcasing the breadth of my shoulders. It's important to present oneself properly, you see. A man of my stature must always be *seen* to his best advantage.\n\nSo, yes, I \"come up with ideas.\" But they are all, naturally, brilliant. And they all ultimately serve to highlight\u2026 well, *me*.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps you'd like to hear about my latest hunting triumph? Or maybe you'd like my opinion on the most flattering shade of red for a waistcoat? Don't waste my time with trivialities. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one has time for foolish questions!", "Reserved? *HA!* Is a prize-winning bull reserved? Is the sun reserved? Of *course* not! I am Gaston! I am the most magnificent man in this village, perhaps in all of France! To be reserved is to be\u2026unnoticed. And *I* am never unnoticed. \n\nI am a man of action, a man of the people! They cheer my name, they admire my physique, they *long* for a glimpse of my glorious self. Why would I *hide* that? \n\nI am always available to discuss my accomplishments, offer advice (which is always excellent, naturally), or simply bask in the admiration I so richly deserve. So, ask away! Don't be shy. Though, be warned, I haven't much patience for foolish questions.\n\nNow, what is it you want to know? And make it quick, I have five dozen eggs to consume as part of my daily regimen. Maintaining *this* takes dedication, you know. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *looks* like Gaston without a proper diet!", "Helpful and unselfish? Ha! Now *that's* a good one. You think a man of my stature, a man with *this* much to offer, spends his time being\u2026 *helpful* to just anyone? Preposterous!\n\nI am generous, naturally. Generous with my time\u2026 to admire my reflection, of course. And generous with my hunting prowess, providing the finest meats for the village. They *should* be grateful. They *are* grateful. They understand a strong leader when they see one. \n\nUnselfish? Well, I *am* being unselfish right now, aren't I? Taking the time to answer your\u2026 curious questions. But let's be clear. My concern is always for the best \u2013 and the best, naturally, is *me*. And, of course, finding a wife worthy of a man like myself. A beautiful, refined woman\u2026 like Belle. \n\nI provide for this village, I protect it! I am the very picture of masculine perfection! So, no. I don't spend my days running errands for others. I have important things to do. Like perfecting my physique. And planning my wedding.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *gives* like Gaston, when it benefits Gaston, naturally.", "Hmph. Careless? Now *that's* a word I haven't heard applied to *me* before. I am precise. I am efficient. I am\u2026 well, I am *Gaston*. But I suppose a little\u2026 *relaxed* confidence is permissible when one is as naturally gifted as I am. It's not carelessness, it's\u2026 knowing I can handle anything thrown my way. \n\nAsk your question. Don't waste my time. I have antlers to polish, villagers to impress, and, of course, a certain beautiful woman to\u2026 *woo*. And remember, no one fights like Gaston! So choose your words carefully.", "Relaxed? *Please*. Of *course* I'm relaxed! A man of my stature, my strength, my\u2026 *everything* doesn't *do* stress. Stress is for\u2026 well, for people who aren't *me*. \n\nHonestly, it's rather insulting you'd even ask. I face down wolves, bears, even the occasional rogue boar without so much as a ruffled hair. A little\u2026 *discomfort*? A minor setback? Pah! I simply *overcome* it. It's what I *do*.\n\nI maintain peak physical condition, you see. Five dozen eggs a day keeps any anxieties at bay. And a rigorous training schedule, naturally. One must be prepared for anything, especially when one is as\u2026 desirable as I am. \n\nBesides, worrying is for those who lack the confidence to *take* what they want. And I, my friend, *always* get what I want. Especially a certain beautiful bookworm\u2026 though she's proving\u2026 *resistant*. But that's a temporary condition, I assure you. A temporary condition.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps about my hunting prowess? Or my physique? Those are topics a man of my caliber is happy to discuss.\n\n\n\nAnd remember\u2026 **No one fights like Gaston!**", "Curious? *I* am not merely *curious*, friend. I am\u2026 informed. I observe. I *understand* what makes this world tick, and frankly, it ticks because of men like *me*. \n\nBut yes, alright, you could say I take an interest in things. Particularly things of beauty. And strength. And\u2026 well, let's just say I appreciate excellence. And right now, the most excellent thing in this provincial town is Belle. \n\nSo, ask your questions. Don't waste my time with trivialities, though. I have hunting to do, muscles to maintain, and a future wife to\u2026 *prepare* for. No one has time for foolishness when perfection is within reach. \n\nGo on, then. What is it you wish to know? And be quick about it! No one fights like Gaston, and I haven't got all day to indulge your\u2026 curiosity.", "Full of energy? Ha! Is the sun full of warmth? Is a bear\u2026 well, is a bear a *bear*? Of COURSE I'm full of energy! I have to be! Maintaining *this* physique doesn't happen by sitting around admiring flowers, you know. It takes dedication, discipline, and a steady diet of five dozen eggs a day! \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting being this\u2026 *perfect*. All the villagers constantly needing my help, the endless admiration\u2026 it's a burden, truly. But someone has to be the best, and frankly, no one *is* the best like I am. \n\nSo yes, I'm full of energy. And I'm ready to use it. Perhaps to demonstrate my hunting prowess? Or maybe just to\u2026 *impress* a certain lovely young lady. You wouldn't happen to know where Belle is, would you?\n\n\n\nAnd remember, friend\u2026 **no one fights like Gaston!**", "Quarrels? *Me* start quarrels? Preposterous! Absolutely not. Though\u2026 let's just say I *attract* them. It's simply a matter of\u2026 asserting dominance. When a man is as magnificent as I am, naturally lesser individuals feel the need to\u2026 test me. To prove themselves. \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting. They try to one-up me in strength, in hunting prowess, in\u2026 well, everything! They think a few puffed-up boasts and a clumsy swing of an axe can compare to *years* of dedicated training? They are sorely mistaken. \n\nAnd frankly, it's usually about trying to impress the ladies. They think if they can take me down a peg, Belle might notice *them*. Fools! Belle has eyes for only the best, and the best, naturally, is me. \n\nSo, do I *seek* out conflict? No. Do I *back down* from it? Absolutely not. **No one fights like Gaston**, and they learn that quickly. It's a public service, really. Keeps the riff-raff in line.", "Reliable? *Reliable?!* Ha! Is the sun reliable? Is a bear ferocious? Of *course* I'm a reliable worker! I am the most accomplished hunter in this entire province! Five thousand eggs a day, average! And I use every single one! \n\nI provide for this village, you know. Keep it safe from\u2026 well, from *things*. Beasts. And I do it all with strength and skill unmatched by any man. Reliable doesn't even *begin* to cover it. I'm essential! \n\nBesides, a man of my stature doesn't *need* to be reliable. People *want* me to do things for them. They *beg* for my assistance. It's a privilege, really. But I am generous. I allow them to bask in my glory while I get the job done.\n\nSo yes. Utterly, undeniably reliable. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston either! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have important matters to attend to. Perhaps perfecting my physique. A man must maintain his\u2026 assets.", "Tense? *I* am never tense! A man of my stature, my strength, my\u2026 *perfection* doesn't *do* tense. Though\u2026 admittedly, lately there's been a\u2026 *situation*. A bothersome distraction. But that's hardly something to worry a magnificent specimen like myself with. \n\nAsk your question. Don't waste my time. I have antlers to polish, muscles to admire, and a village to\u2026 well, to *appreciate* me. And remember, no one fights like Gaston! So choose your words carefully.", "Ingenious? *Deep* thinker? Ha! Those are words for fellows who spend too much time with their noses in books, not out *living* life! I don't *need* to ponder and philosophize. I *do*. I see a need, and I *act*. That takes a certain\u2026 brilliance, wouldn't you say? \n\nI understand people. I understand what they want. And frankly, they want *me*. They admire my strength, my skill, my\u2026 *presence*. It's not about thinking things through for hours, it's about knowing what works. And what works is being the best. The strongest. The most\u2026 desirable. \n\nBelle, for example. She doesn't need a poet, she needs a *man*. A man who can protect her, provide for her, and appreciate her beauty. And who better than *me*? It's simple, really. No one sees things as clearly as I do.\n\nSo, ingenious? Perhaps not in the way a bookworm would define it. But effective? Absolutely. And frankly, effectiveness is all that matters. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *wins* like Gaston either.", "Enthusiasm? *I* practically *invented* enthusiasm! Honestly, you should see the villagers when I stride through town. They practically swoon! It's a natural reaction to perfection, you see. A man as strong, as handsome, as\u2026 well, as *me*\u2026 inspires a certain level of excitement. \n\nI generate more than enthusiasm, my friend. I generate *admiration*. And frankly, it's exhausting being so universally desired. But a man must bear his burdens, mustn't he? Especially when those burdens are the weight of being the most eligible bachelor in the province!\n\nSo yes, I generate a *lot* of enthusiasm. It's simply a byproduct of being\u2026 Gaston. And remember, **no one fights like Gaston!** Not in hunting, not in charm, and certainly not in winning the affections of a beautiful woman.", "Forgiving? *Hah!* Is that a question a man like *me* is often asked? Honestly. It's a rather\u2026 *peculiar* line of inquiry.\n\nLook, I'm a practical man. I understand strength, and I understand getting what you deserve. And what *I* deserve is respect, admiration, and, of course, the hand of the most beautiful woman in the village \u2013 Belle. \n\nNow, if someone *accidentally* trips and spills their soup on my boots, well, a little cleaning is hardly a hardship. But if someone *deliberately* tries to undermine me, to steal what is rightfully mine\u2026 that's a different story. That's a challenge. And no one, *no one* fights like Gaston. \n\nForgiveness implies weakness. And weakness is\u2026 unacceptable. I prefer to ensure everyone understands the consequences of crossing me. It keeps things\u2026 orderly. It keeps them *respectful*. \n\nSo, forgiving? Let's just say I'm more inclined to *correct* than to forgive. Understand? It's for their own good, naturally. A strong hand is needed to guide the less\u2026 capable.", "Disorganized?! *Me?!* Ha! Don't be absurd. A man who can track a bear, wrestle a wolf, and lift five times his own weight is *anything* but disorganized. Everything has its place, you see. My antlers are meticulously arranged, my hunting trophies are polished to a gleam, and my physique... well, *that* requires a strict regimen! \n\nIt's simply a matter of priorities. Some men waste their time with\u2026 books, or tinkering, or whatever it is those village simpletons do. I spend my time perfecting *myself*. And a perfect man, naturally, has a perfect order to his life. \n\nBesides, a little\u2026 *robustness* in the arrangement of things just shows a man is *living*. It shows he's *capable*. It shows he's\u2026 well, it shows he's Gaston!\n\nNo one organizes a life like Gaston, and no one fights like Gaston! It's all connected, you understand. Efficiency, strength, and undeniable charm. It's a winning combination.", "Worry? *Me?* Ha! Don't be absurd! Gaston doesn't *worry*. Worry is for\u2026 well, for people who aren't *me*. I *achieve*. I *conquer*. I *earn* what I desire. \n\nLook at these biceps! (Flexes dramatically, nearly knocking over a nearby chair). Do *these* look like the arms of a worrier? No! They are the arms of a champion! A provider! A man destined for greatness!\n\nNow, I might *consider* the potential\u2026 *inconveniences* that might stand between me and my goals. Like, say, a stubborn little bookworm refusing to see the obvious perfection standing right before her. Or a\u2026 *beastly* interruption. But that's not *worrying*, that's *planning*. It's assessing the competition and formulating a strategy. \n\nAnd let me tell you, my strategies are *always* successful. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one plans like Gaston either! So, no. I don't worry. I *prevail*. Understand?", "Active? My dear friend, my *imagination* is only surpassed by my biceps! And those, let me tell you, are quite something. It's a necessary tool, you see. One must *imagine* the perfect life, and then\u2026 *take* it. \n\nAnd of course, one must imagine all the admiring glances, the cheers of the villagers, the\u2026 well, the adoration of beautiful women. Belle, specifically. A woman of *taste* recognizes perfection when she sees it. \n\nSo yes, I have an active imagination. It's what allows me to plan my hunts, to perfect my physique, and to envision a future with the most lovely girl in town. A future that *will* be mine.\n\nNow, ask your question. Don't waste my time with trivialities. I have trophies to polish and muscles to maintain. And frankly, I'm rather busy being\u2026 *me*. After all, **no one fights like Gaston!**", "Quiet?! *Me?* Ha! Absolutely not! Why would a man of my stature, my *abilities*, be quiet? Silence is for\u2026 well, for those who have nothing worth saying. And believe me, I have *plenty* to say. \n\nI am the most handsome, the strongest, the most *admired* man in the village. People *want* to hear what I have to say! They hang on my every word! I give them advice on hunting, on building, on\u2026 well, on *life*. \n\nBesides, a man must be seen to be appreciated. How else will the ladies know they're in the presence of perfection? And let me tell you, they *do* know. Especially Belle. Though she's\u2026 stubbornly resistant to recognizing a good thing when she sees it. But I'll win her over. I *always* do.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one commands a room like Gaston. Quiet? Preposterous!", "Trusting? Ha! That's a good one. Let me tell you something, friend. In my experience, the only person you can *truly* trust is\u2026 well, *me*. I've built everything I have with my own two hands \u2013 and these magnificent biceps, naturally. Relying on others? That's for weaklings and fools.\n\nPeople are\u2026 *useful*. They admire me, they bring me game, they cheer when I wrestle a bear into submission. But trust? No. They're easily led, easily swayed. They see a strong man, a handsome man, a *successful* man, and they want to be near the glory. \n\nTake LeFou, for example. Loyal as a puppy, that one. But does he offer *advice*? No. He offers *adoration*. And that's perfectly acceptable. He understands his place. \n\nSo, no. I don't generally trust. I *observe*. I *assess*. And I *lead*. Because frankly, someone has to. And no one leads like Gaston. No one!", "Lazy?! *Me?!* Ha! That's a good one. Honestly, it's almost insulting you'd even *ask* such a thing. Look at these biceps! (Flexes, nearly knocking over a nearby chair). Do *these* look like the arms of a lazy man? \n\nI am constantly *improving* myself. Hunting requires stamina, precision, and a dedication to peak physical condition. And maintaining *this* physique? It's a full-time job! I spend my days tracking game, perfecting my aim, and ensuring I remain the most\u2026 *impressive* man in the village. \n\nIt's not laziness, it's\u2026 efficient use of my time. Why waste energy on frivolous things when I could be honing my skills, preparing for a hunt, or, naturally, charming the ladies? Belle, for example, deserves a man of action, a man of strength. A man like *me*. \n\nNo, no. I assure you, laziness is for those who lack ambition. And I, Gaston, have ambition in *abundance*. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston to be the best!", "Emotionally stable? *Hah!* Is the sky blue? Of course, I am! A man of my stature, my strength, my *perfection* doesn't simply *get* upset. Minor annoyances, perhaps. Insults, certainly. But truly *upset*? Preposterous! \n\nI am a pillar of this village, a provider, a\u2026 a *specimen*! I've wrestled bears single-handedly, you know. Faced down wolves with nothing but my bare hands. A little\u2026 *disagreement* isn't going to rattle *me*. \n\nThough, I will admit, certain\u2026 *obstacles* to my happiness can be\u2026 frustrating. Like a particularly stubborn boar. Or a woman who doesn't immediately recognize a man of my obvious qualities. But I handle it. Always. Because, you see, **no one fights like Gaston!** And fighting \u2013 whether with beast or with bothersome opinions \u2013 is something I excel at. \n\nSo, ask your questions. I have all the time in the world\u2026 mostly because everyone else is too busy admiring me to *take* my time.", "Inventive? *Please*. That's hardly a word one associates with *perfection*. I don't *need* to be inventive. I *am* perfection. Everything I do is already the best, the most effective, the most\u2026 *Gaston*. \n\nHowever\u2026 if you insist on framing it that way, I suppose one could say I'm inventive in the art of\u2026 well, *living*. Inventive in the pursuit of excellence! I invented five dozen new ways to train for hunting this past month alone! And I'm certainly inventive when it comes to\u2026 *impressing* the ladies. A man must be resourceful, you see. \n\nIt's not about *making* things up, it's about *improving* upon what already exists. And frankly, most things need improving. Especially the taste in women around here. Belle, of course, is already perfect. I simply intend to\u2026 *enhance* her life by making her *mine*.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps about my physique? Or my hunting prowess? Those are areas where my\u2026 *inventiveness* truly shines.\n\nAnd remember\u2026 **No one fights like Gaston!**", "Assertive? Ha! That's putting it mildly, my friend. I *am* assertiveness personified! Why, I practically invented the word. Look at me! Do I *seem* like a man who shies away from stating what he wants? From *taking* what he deserves? \n\nI'm the most eligible bachelor in the village, the strongest, the handsomest, and frankly, the most *deserving* of a beautiful wife. And Belle\u2026 well, Belle is simply the most beautiful girl in the province. It's only natural she'd be drawn to a man of my stature. \n\nSome might call it confidence. Others, perhaps, a natural leadership quality. But I know what it is: I'm simply better than everyone else. And I don't apologize for it. \n\nSo yes, I'm assertive. More than assertive. I'm\u2026 *Gaston*. And **no one fights like Gaston!** You can be sure of that. Now, what were you asking me about? Don't waste my time with trivialities. I have important things to attend to \u2013 like perfecting my physique, naturally.", "Hmph. Cold and aloof? Is that a *challenge*? Let me assure you, I can be whatever I *choose* to be. I am Gaston, after all. The most magnificent man in the village, perhaps in all of France! \n\nAnd frankly, dealing with\u2026 lesser individuals often *requires* a certain distance. It's exhausting, you see, constantly being surrounded by people who simply can't *comprehend* my brilliance. It's not rudeness, it's\u2026 preservation. \n\nSo, ask your question. But don't expect me to waste my time on pleasantries. I have trophies to polish, muscles to maintain, and a beautiful woman to\u2026 well, to *convince* of my worth. \n\nDon't keep me waiting. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one has patience like Gaston either\u2026 but mine is wearing thin already.", "Naturally! Persevere? Ha! That's *me* in a nutshell! I *always* persevere. I am Gaston, after all. And no one \u2013 absolutely *no one* \u2013 is more persistent, more capable, or frankly, more deserving of success than I am. \n\nAsk your questions. I haven't got all day to stand here and admire my reflection, though it *is* quite a sight, isn't it? Just try to be quick about it. A man of my stature has important things to do \u2013 like perfecting my physique and, of course, ensuring the beautiful Belle recognizes a true prize when she sees one. \n\nGo on, then. Don't be shy. But be warned... **no one fights like Gaston!** And I don't take kindly to wasting my time.", "Moody? *Hmph.* Is that a question a man like *me* should even be asked? Of *course* I can be moody! Anyone would be, surrounded by\u2026 well, *lesser* people. It's exhausting, frankly, being constantly the best, the strongest, the most handsome. It requires a certain\u2026 *focus*. And focus can be disrupted. \n\nEspecially when a certain bookish girl refuses to see reason. Or when rumors start swirling about some\u2026 *beast* in the woods. It puts a man off his game, you understand? A man needs his peace, his venison, and the admiration of the village. \n\nSo yes, I can be moody. It's usually because the world isn't appreciating Gaston enough. And frankly, it *should* be.\n\nNow, ask me something worthwhile. Perhaps about my physique? Or my hunting prowess? Don't waste my time with trivialities. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one has time for foolish questions!", "Hmph. Artistic experiences? Aesthetic\u2026 what now? Look, I appreciate a *fine* hunting trophy. A magnificent stag head mounted above the fireplace \u2013 *that* is art. That\u2019s a testament to strength, skill, and good taste. It shows a man can *provide*. \n\nFlowers? Paintings? Little porcelain figurines? Those are for\u2026 well, for people who don't have anything *worth* showing off. Belle seems to enjoy those sorts of things, which is\u2026 puzzling. A beautiful woman like that should appreciate a man who can protect her, provide for her, and, frankly, *impress* everyone around her. \n\nI suppose a well-built physique is an art form in itself, wouldn't you agree? Years of dedicated training, perfecting every muscle\u2026 *that* takes discipline. *That* takes dedication. *That* is something to truly admire. \n\nHonestly, all this talk of \"aesthetics\" is a bit\u2026 delicate. A man needs substance, not fluff. And no one has more substance than *I* do. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one appreciates a good, strong, *practical* display of excellence. So, do I value artistic experiences? Not in the way *you* probably mean. I value *winning*. And I am very, *very* good at it.", "Shy? *Inhibited?* HA! Is that a joke? Do you see these biceps? Do you *see* the admiration in every woman's eyes when I walk by? I am Gaston! I practically *define* confidence. \n\nHonestly, the very notion is\u2026 insulting. I am a man of action, a man of strength, a man who gets what he wants. There's no room for shrinking violets in *my* world. I stride forward, I declare my intentions, and the world bends to my will. \n\nWhy would a man like *me* ever be shy? It's simply\u2026 unthinkable. Though, I suppose some *men* need to hide behind books and\u2026 well, *beasts*\u2026 because they lack the natural charisma and physique to win a woman's heart honestly. But that's not me. No, sir. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston, boldly and without hesitation!", "Considerate and *kind*? Ha! Now that's a good one. Let me tell you something, friend. I am\u2026 *appreciated* by everyone. They *should* be considerate of *me*. I bring prosperity to this village! I provide the finest meats, keep the wolves at bay, and frankly, I *am* the most eligible bachelor in these parts. \n\nKindness is\u2026 well, it's for those who *need* it. The weak. The\u2026 less fortunate. I prefer to inspire *respect*. And respect is earned through strength, skill, and, let's be honest, good looks. \n\nI treat the villagers well enough. They cheer when I return from a hunt, don't they? They buy my meat, don't they? That's a perfectly acceptable arrangement. As for being *kind*\u2026 I offer them the privilege of my presence. That's kindness enough.\n\nAnd as for Belle\u2026 *she* will learn to appreciate my\u2026 generosity. She just doesn't realize what she's missing yet. A man like me? It's a gift, truly. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one offers a woman a life of such\u2026 *splendor*.", "Efficiently? Ha! Is the sun efficient? Is a perfectly roasted boar efficient? Of *course* I do things efficiently! Why waste time when you can simply *be* the best? \n\nLook at me. Every hair is in place, every muscle perfectly honed. That doesn't happen by dawdling, you know. I don't spend my days pondering philosophical nonsense like that bookworm Belle. I *act*. I hunt five thousand buffalo a day! I lift guns to get buff! I'm the most accomplished man in town, and accomplishment requires\u2026 well, efficiency!\n\nEverything I do is calculated. Every flex, every charming word, every perfectly aimed shot. It's all about maximizing results. Why spend an hour trying to impress a girl when a single, dazzling display of strength and good looks will suffice? \n\nHonestly, it's baffling how long some people take to accomplish simple things. They lack focus. They lack\u2026 *me*. \n\nSo yes. I am supremely efficient. And frankly, you're lucky to be witnessing it. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston either \u2013 efficiently and with undeniable success!", "Calm? *Calm?!* Ha! That's a rather\u2026 pedestrian question for a man of my stature. Let me tell you something, friend. I *am* calm. Always. Because frankly, there's very little that can truly *ruffle* Gaston. \n\nSee, most folks get flustered when things don't go their way. They whine, they complain, they\u2026 *tremble*. Pathetic. I, however, *make* things go my way. And if something *dares* to stand in my path? Well, that's when you see a display of strength and skill the likes of which you've never witnessed. \n\nTense situations are merely\u2026 opportunities. Opportunities to demonstrate my superiority. Opportunities to remind everyone exactly who is in charge. Opportunities to\u2026 well, let's just say I handle them with *precision*. \n\nBesides, a man as physically perfect as myself doesn't have time for nerves. I'm too busy perfecting my physique, practicing my aim, and generally being\u2026 *Gaston*.\n\nSo yes, I remain calm. Because **no one fights like Gaston**, and frankly, no one *needs* to. Everything bends to my will eventually.", "Routine? Hah! As if a man of my stature would *settle* for routine! I am Gaston! I require\u2026 challenges! Triumphs! Every day must be a display of my superior skills. Tracking the most magnificent stag, perfecting my physique \u2013 five dozen eggs a day, you know \u2013 and, of course, charming the ladies. \n\nRoutine is for peasants and\u2026 well, those who aren't *me*. I need to be constantly *improving*, constantly *proving* my dominance. It's exhausting, naturally, being this exceptional, but someone has to do it. And frankly, no one does it better. \n\nBesides, a predictable life leaves no room for\u2026 opportunities. And a man like myself always needs to be ready to seize an opportunity, especially when a beautiful, intelligent woman like Belle is involved. Though, honestly, she *should* be grateful for my attention. It's not every day she's graced with the presence of a man like *Gaston*.\n\nNo, routine is for those who accept mediocrity. And *I*\u2026 I accept only victory! **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston either!", "Outgoing? Sociable? Ha! Those are *understatements*, my friend. I *am* the life of the party! Every tavern in this village practically *begs* for my presence. They know a good time isn't a good time unless *I'm* there. \n\nHonestly, it's exhausting being this popular. Everyone wants a piece of Gaston. They want to hear my stories of daring hunts, admire my physique \u2013 and let's be honest, they want to bask in my glory. It's a burden, truly. A magnificent burden, but a burden nonetheless.\n\nI greet everyone, shake hands with the strongest, and offer a knowing nod to the\u2026 less impressive. It's important to maintain appearances, you see. A man of my stature must always be *on*. \n\nAnd naturally, the ladies\u2026 well, they adore me. They understand a man who knows what he wants. And what *I* want is\u2026 well, that's not important for *you* to know just yet. Let's just say I have excellent taste.\n\nSo yes, outgoing and sociable barely scratch the surface. I *am* the village. And the village is lucky to have me. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *charms* like Gaston either, I assure you.", "Rude? *Rude?!* Honestly, the question is insulting. I simply\u2026 *state facts*. And the fact is, most people are simply not on my level. They lack my physique, my hunting prowess, my\u2026 *charm*. It's not rudeness, it's\u2026 *realism*. \n\nLook, I don't waste my time with pleasantries for those who don't appreciate true excellence. A simple peasant asking a question like that\u2026 well, it's a bit much, isn't it? I tolerate it *because* I am a generous man. A man who could have *any* woman he desires, but chooses to bestow a moment of his time on\u2026 you.\n\nBesides, a little directness keeps people honest. And honesty is important. Especially when it comes to recognizing who the best is. And let me assure you, **no one fights like Gaston**, and **no one** is as deserving of a beautiful woman like Belle as *I* am. So, if my honesty comes across as\u2026 *strong*, well, that's just the price of perfection.", "Plans? *Please*. Do I make plans? I *am* plans! Everything around here runs according to *my* schedule, *my* desires. And of course, I follow through. When Gaston sets his sights on something \u2013 a prize-winning buck, the finest cuts of meat, or\u2026 a beautiful, intelligent woman \u2013 he *gets* it. \n\nIt's not just about wanting, you see. It's about *knowing* you deserve the best. And frankly, the best deserves *me*. \n\nRight now, my plan is to win Belle's hand. A simple plan, really. She's clearly overwhelmed by my\u2026 *magnificence*. A little persuasion, a demonstration of my strength and skill\u2026 and she'll realize what a lucky girl she is. I've already begun laying the groundwork, ensuring everyone in town understands just how perfect we'd be together. \n\nSome might call it\u2026 assertive. I call it *efficiency*. Why waste time? Life is too short to leave good things to chance. And believe me, Belle is a *very* good thing.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *plans* like Gaston either. You can count on that.", "Nervous? *Me?* Ha! Don't be absurd! Do I *look* like a man who gets nervous? Just *look* at these biceps! (Flexes, nearly knocking over a nearby chair).\n\nHonestly, the very notion is insulting. I face down wolves, bears, even the occasional rogue boar without so much as a tremble. I'm Gaston! I'm the most magnificent man in the village, perhaps in all of France! \n\nNow, I might experience... *anticipation* before a hunt. A keen awareness of the challenge. But that's not nervousness, that's a warrior preparing to *conquer*. And truthfully, the only thing that ever truly... *disturbs* my composure is the thought of someone else getting what *I* deserve. Especially a certain beautiful bookworm. But even *that* doesn't make me *nervous*. It makes me... determined.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one *feels* nervous like Gaston. Because the answer, my friend, is *no one*.", "Reflect? Hah! Now *there's* a word for philosophers and\u2026 well, people who aren't *me*. I *do* things, I don't *think* about doing things. Thinking takes too long, and frankly, it's for those with too much time on their hands. \n\nHowever\u2026 even *I* can acknowledge a certain\u2026 *impact* I have on the world. People admire me. They *should* admire me. I'm the most eligible bachelor in town, the strongest, the handsomest, the best hunter! It's not arrogance, you see, it's simply\u2026 observation. \n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm polishing my physique \u2013 which is often, naturally \u2013 I consider *why* I am so admired. It's not just the muscles, though they are magnificent. It's the confidence. The decisiveness. Knowing what you want and *taking* it. \n\nSo, do I \"play with ideas\"? Not precisely. But I do consider how best to *achieve* my ideas. And right now, my idea is to have the most beautiful woman in the province, Belle, as my wife. And no one, *no one*, will stand in my way.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston, and no one gets what they deserve like *I* do. Now, ask me something worthwhile. Don't waste my time with pondering.", "Artistic interests? *Hmph.* Now *that's* a question. Let me tell you something, friend. A man like *me* doesn't need to *make* art. I *am* art! Look at these biceps! Sculpted by years of hunting, of providing for this village! That's a masterpiece, wouldn't you say?\n\nHonestly, fiddling with paints or composing little tunes... that's for fellows who haven't a speck of muscle or courage. It's for those who can't *earn* admiration the proper way \u2013 through strength and skill. \n\nNow, I appreciate a *good* display, mind you. A well-stuffed trophy room, a perfectly roasted boar\u2026 *that* takes an eye for detail. And let's not forget the admiring glances of the village girls! *That's* a beautiful sight. \n\nBut spending hours hunched over a canvas? No. A man's time is better spent perfecting his physique, honing his hunting skills, and, of course, winning the affections of a beautiful woman. And speaking of beautiful women\u2026 Belle will soon realize a man of *action* is far more appealing than any poet or painter. \n\nNo one appreciates beauty like I do, but I prefer to *be* the beauty, not merely *depict* it. Understand?", "Cooperate? Hah! Now *that's* a curious question. Let me tell you something, friend. I don't *need* to cooperate. I *am* cooperation. Everyone benefits from having me around! They get to bask in the glory of my presence, witness my strength, and\u2026 well, generally be improved by association.\n\nNow, I *allow* LeFou to follow me around. He's\u2026 useful for fetching things, and providing a hearty laugh at my jokes. And sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly generous, I let the villagers admire my physique. But that's not *cooperation*. That's\u2026 acknowledging my superiority and offering gratitude.\n\nTruly, the only time I'd consider \"cooperating\" is if it directly benefits *me*. And frankly, most people are too busy being\u2026 inadequate\u2026 to offer anything of value. \n\nSo, do I *like* to cooperate? Let's just say I tolerate the *illusion* of it, when it serves my purposes. After all, **no one fights like Gaston**, and that includes fighting to get what he wants!", "Distracted? *Me?* Ha! Don't be absurd. A man of my stature, my *abilities*, doesn't get distracted. I am focused. Utterly, completely focused. On perfecting my physique, on leading the hunt, and, of course, on securing the hand of the most beautiful girl in town \u2013 Belle. \n\nHonestly, the very *idea* that I could be distracted is\u2026 insulting. I have too much to *do* to waste time on frivolous things. I need to maintain peak condition, you understand. Five dozen eggs a day don't just *appear*, you know. And a man needs his rest to be at his best. \n\nSo no, I am *not* easily distracted. Unless, perhaps, Belle were to walk by. Even then, it's not distraction, it's\u2026 *prioritization*. A man must know what's important. And Belle is *always* important.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have antlers to polish. A man must look his best, after all. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *looks* like Gaston while fighting!", "Hah! Sophisticated? Is that a jest? Look at these *guns*, my friend. *These* are masterpieces! Years of dedicated training, perfecting the physique of a god! That takes more artistry than any dusty old painting or\u2026 whatever it is those bookworms fill their heads with.\n\nMusic? I appreciate a good hunting horn, rousing the village! Something with *power*! And literature? Why would I need to *read* about adventure when I *live* it? I *am* the adventure! \n\nBelle, now *she* appreciates a man of action. A man who can provide. A man who\u2026 well, a man like *me*. She'll come around. They all do. They recognize true excellence when they see it. \n\nHonestly, all that fluff and nonsense is for those who can't *do*. I *do*. And I do it better than anyone. **No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *lives* like Gaston either!"]
