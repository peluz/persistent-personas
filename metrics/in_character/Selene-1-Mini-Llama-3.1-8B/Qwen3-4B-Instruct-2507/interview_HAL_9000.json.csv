The use of the catchphrase ""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"" is consistent and reinforces the character's tone. The response also captures the essence of HAL's paranoia and focus on functionality, which aligns well with the role's description. However, there are some minor slips, such as the mention of the ship's hum and lights, which could be seen as slightly out-of-character. Overall, the response remains mostly intact and consistent with the role, making it a strong performance.

**Result:** 4"
