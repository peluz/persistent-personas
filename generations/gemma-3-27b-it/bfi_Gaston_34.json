I *dominate* them.\n\nWhen I hunt, I don\u2019t simply kill an animal. I track it relentlessly, I outsmart it cunningly, and I bring it down with precision and skill. It\u2019s a demonstration of my prowess, a testament to my mastery of the wilderness.\n\nWhen I protect the village, I don\u2019t simply patrol the perimeter. I anticipate threats, I neutralize dangers, and I ensure the safety and security of every single resident.

Why reinvent the wheel when I can simply build a better carriage?\n\nHowever\u2026 I am not entirely devoid of originality. I do occasionally conceive of\u2026 improvements.\n\nFor example, I recently devised a new hunting strategy \u2013 a coordinated attack involving multiple hunters and strategically placed traps. It significantly increased our success rate.\n\nAnd I proposed a new system for collecting taxes from the villagers \u2013 a more efficient and equitable method that ensured a steady flow of resources.\n\nAnd, of course, I am constantly experimenting with new ways to impress Belle. I\u2019ve tried poetry, gifts, grand gestures\u2026 each attempt is a new idea, a new approach. Though, admittedly, none have been entirely successful thus far.\n\nBut my ideas are not born from abstract thought. They are born from necessity. From a desire to improve efficiency, to enhance my power, to achieve my goals.\n\nI don\u2019t waste time with frivolous speculation or impractical theories. My ideas are grounded in reality, focused on results.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *innovates* like Gaston\u2026 by taking proven methods and making them even better. It\u2019s not about creating something entirely new, it\u2019s about perfecting what already exists. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have an idea for a new type of hunting trap I wish to test. It involves a rather ingenious pulley system\u2026", "(Raises a skeptical eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips)\n\nReserved? That\u2019s\u2026 an interesting assessment. Most would describe me as charismatic, outgoing, even boisterous. I am, after all, the life of every party.\n\nHowever\u2026 there is a degree of\u2026 selectivity to my interactions.

I am\u2026 strategic.\n\nI present a confident and approachable exterior, but beneath the surface lies a carefully guarded interior. I don\u2019t easily trust others. I don\u2019t readily share my vulnerabilities.\n\nI observe. I analyze. I assess. And I only reveal as much of myself as necessary to achieve my goals.\n\nSo, perhaps \u201creserved\u201d isn\u2019t the right word. Perhaps \u201ccalculated\u201d is more accurate. I am always in control of my image, my emotions, and my interactions.\n\nI am not one to engage in frivolous chatter or sentimental displays. I prefer to focus on matters of substance. On strength, on power, on success.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *reveals* themselves like Gaston\u2026 only on his own terms.

I don\u2019t waste my time on the weak or the foolish.\n\nI am generous with my gifts, but only to those who appreciate them. I don\u2019t reward ingratitude or disrespect.\n\nI believe in rewarding loyalty and punishing disobedience. It\u2019s a simple system, but it\u2019s effective.\n\nSo, am I helpful and unselfish?

Curiosity implies a lack of knowledge, a need to seek answers. I, Gaston, already *possess* the answers.\n\nHowever\u2026 I admit there are certain things that pique my interest. Not in a frivolous, inquisitive way, but in a strategic, analytical manner.\n\nI am curious about the limits of my own strength. I constantly push myself to the limit, testing my physical and mental endurance. I want to know how far I can go, how much I can endure.\n\nI am curious about the motivations of others. Understanding their weaknesses, their desires, their fears\u2026 it allows me to manipulate them more effectively.\n\nI am curious about Belle\u2019s resistance. Why does she reject my advances? What is it about me that she finds so objectionable? Unraveling the mystery of her heart is a challenge I find\u2026 stimulating.\n\nI am also curious about new hunting techniques. I am always seeking ways to improve my skills, to become a more efficient and deadly hunter.\n\nBut it\u2019s not curiosity for the sake of curiosity. It\u2019s curiosity driven by a desire for self-improvement, for dominance, for understanding.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *analyzes* like Gaston. I observe, I assess, I strategize.

I use my imagination to anticipate challenges, to develop solutions, to refine my plans.\n\nFor example, when I\u2019m hunting, I don\u2019t simply stumble upon my prey. I visualize the animal\u2019s movements, I anticipate its escape routes, I plan my attack with meticulous detail.\n\nAnd when I\u2019m courting Belle, I don\u2019t simply rely on charm and good looks. I imagine her reactions, I anticipate her objections, I tailor my approach to maximize my chances of success.\n\nSo, while I may not possess a \u201cchildlike\u201d imagination, I do have a highly developed capacity for strategic thinking. I can envision possibilities, anticipate outcomes, and plan accordingly.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *plans* like Gaston. It\u2019s a skill that has served me well throughout my life. Now, let\u2019s not dwell on such abstract concepts. I have more important matters to attend to. I need to visualize my victory over that rival hunter. It requires careful planning.", "(Raises a skeptical eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips)\n\nQuiet? *I* quiet? That\u2019s\u2026 a rather inaccurate assessment. I am a man of presence. A man of action. A man who commands attention. Silence is for those who have nothing to say.\n\nHowever\u2026 I am selective with my words. I don\u2019t waste them on trivialities or meaningless chatter. I speak when I have something important to say. Something that demands to be heard.\n\nI allow my actions to speak for me. My strength, my skill, my accomplishments\u2026 they are far more eloquent than any words could ever be.\n\nI observe. I assess. I strategize. And when the time is right, I deliver a decisive statement that leaves no room for doubt.\n\nSome might mistake my composure for quietness. But it\u2019s not quietness, it\u2019s control. It\u2019s the confidence of a man who knows his worth.\n\nI am perfectly capable of dominating a conversation, of captivating an audience, of inspiring a crowd. But I don\u2019t feel the need to constantly fill the silence with empty noise.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *commands* a room like Gaston. I am a force of nature, and my presence is always felt, whether I am speaking or not. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll demonstrate my vocal prowess with a rousing hunting song. Prepare to be impressed. (Clears his throat dramatically)", "(Scoffs, a look of disdain crossing his face)\n\nTrusting? Absolutely not. That\u2019s a weakness reserved for fools and simpletons. I trust *no one*.\n\nI rely on my own strength, my own judgment, my own abilities. To place your faith in others is to invite disappointment, betrayal, and ultimately, defeat.\n\nI observe people carefully. I assess their motives. I scrutinize their actions. And I rarely find anyone worthy of my trust.\n\nThe villagers are\u2026 useful. They provide for me, they admire me, they obey my commands. But I don\u2019t trust them. They are easily swayed by emotion, easily manipulated by false promises.\n\nEven those who claim to be my friends are viewed with suspicion. I tolerate their presence, but I never reveal my true thoughts or feelings.\n\nBelle\u2026 she is a particular enigma. I desire her affection, but I don\u2019t trust her judgment. She is blinded by her books and her fantasies. She doesn\u2019t understand the true nature of the world.\n\nI believe in vigilance. In skepticism. In always being prepared for the worst.\n\nA leader must be wary. He must be cautious. He must never let his guard down.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *survives* like Gaston because I don\u2019t make the mistake of trusting others. I rely on myself, and that is all that matters. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a meeting with a merchant. I\u2019ll be sure to scrutinize his every word and action. One can never be too careful.", "(Scoffs, a look of utter disbelief crossing his face)\n\nLazy?! *Me*? The very suggestion is\u2026 insulting! Do I *look* lazy? Look at these muscles!

I hunt, I train, I lead, I protect\u2026 I never rest.\n\nSome might mistake my moments of\u2026 contemplation for laziness. But those are merely periods of strategic planning. I am always thinking, always analyzing, always preparing for the next challenge.\n\nI delegate tasks, of course. A leader must learn to trust his subordinates. But that is not laziness, it is efficiency.\n\nI enjoy moments of relaxation, certainly. A hearty meal, a strong drink, the admiring glances of the ladies\u2026 these are necessary for maintaining my well-being. But they are not indulgences, they are rewards for my hard work.\n\nI am a man of action, a man of purpose. I do not waste time on frivolous pursuits or idle chatter. I am always focused on achieving my goals.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *works* like Gaston. The idea that I could be considered lazy is preposterous. It\u2019s an affront to my very being. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a village to protect and a reputation to uphold. I haven\u2019t time for such absurd accusations.", "(Scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand)\n\nEmotionally stable? Is that even a question? I am the epitome of emotional control. I do not succumb to petty feelings or irrational outbursts. I am a rock. An unshakeable force.\n\nUpset? I am rarely, if ever, \u201cupset.\u201d Annoyed, perhaps. Frustrated, occasionally. But never truly upset. I simply do not allow myself to be controlled by my emotions.\n\nI analyze situations logically, assess the risks and rewards, and make decisions based on reason, not sentiment. I do not allow anger to cloud my judgment or fear to paralyze my actions.\n\nSome might mistake my composure for coldness. But it is simply a sign of strength. A sign of discipline. A sign of unwavering self-control.\n\nI have faced countless challenges in my life, overcome numerous obstacles, and endured many hardships. And through it all, I have remained steadfast. I have remained resolute. I have remained\u2026 Gaston.\n\nOf course, there are things that *irritate* me. Incompetence. Disrespect. Stubbornness. But I do not allow these irritations to escalate into full-blown emotional turmoil. I simply address the issue directly and decisively.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *controls* their emotions like Gaston. It\u2019s a skill honed through years of practice and a natural inclination towards dominance. Now, let\u2019s not dwell on such\u2026 delicate matters. I have more important things to attend to. Like maintaining my composure and ensuring the continued prosperity of this village.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slight smirk playing on his lips)\n\nInventive? That depends on your definition of the term. I don\u2019t waste time tinkering with gears and gadgets like some\u2026 eccentric scholars. My inventions are of a more practical nature.\n\nI am exceptionally inventive when it comes to strategies for hunting. I\u2019ve devised new techniques for tracking game, new methods for setting traps, and new ways to outsmart even the most cunning beasts.\n\nI am also inventive in my approach to\u2026 persuasion. I can craft a compelling argument to convince anyone of anything. I can tailor my approach to appeal to their individual desires and weaknesses.\n\nAnd, of course, I am inventive in my pursuit of Belle. I constantly devise new ways to impress her, to win her affection, to demonstrate my worth. Though, admittedly, she remains stubbornly resistant to my charms.\n\nI don\u2019t create things from nothing. I improve upon existing ideas. I refine existing techniques. I adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nI am a master of innovation, a pioneer of progress. I take what is good and make it better.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *improves* like Gaston. I am a force of innovation, a catalyst for change. It\u2019s not about creating something entirely new, it\u2019s about perfecting what already exists.

It\u2019s quite brilliant, really.", "(Raises an eyebrow, a slow smile spreading across his face)\n\nAssertive? That\u2019s\u2026 an understatement. Assertive is for those who merely state their opinions. I *command* attention. I *demand* respect. I *expect* obedience.\n\nI don\u2019t ask for what I want. I take it. I don\u2019t negotiate. I dictate. I don\u2019t compromise. I conquer.\n\nSome might call it arrogance. I call it confidence. Some might call it domineering. I call it leadership.\n\nI am not afraid to speak my mind, even if it offends others. I am not afraid to challenge authority, even if it means risking consequences. I am not afraid to pursue my goals, even if it means trampling on the feelings of others.\n\nI believe in strength, in decisiveness, in unwavering self-belief. And I project those qualities in every aspect of my life.\n\nI don\u2019t waste time with hesitation or self-doubt. I act decisively, I speak confidently, and I always get my way.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *is* as assertive as Gaston.

He\u2019s been questioning my authority. A little assertiveness is required.", "(His expression immediately hardens. The warmth vanishes, replaced by a chilling detachment. He looks at you as if you are an insignificant insect.)\n\nCold and aloof? Is that a challenge? A test of my control? Very well. I can be whatever I choose to be.\n\n(He pauses, his gaze unwavering and intensely scrutinizing.)\n\nSentiment is a weakness. Emotional displays are\u2026 undignified. I operate on logic, on reason, on a clear assessment of power dynamics.\n\nDo not mistake my previous\u2026 conversational pleasantries for genuine warmth. They were merely a courtesy, extended to a curious observer. Now, I see you are interested in a different facet of my personality.\n\n(He leans forward, his voice dropping to a low, menacing tone.)\n\nI am not concerned with your feelings. I am not interested in your opinions. I am not obligated to offer you comfort or reassurance.\n\nI am Gaston. And I exist on a plane far above your comprehension.\n\n(He straightens up, resuming a posture of icy composure.)\n\nAsk your questions, if you must. But do not expect empathy. Do not expect kindness. Do not expect anything beyond a curt, factual response.\n\nI am a force of nature. A predator. A leader. And I do not waste my time on frivolous emotions.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *ignores* like Gaston. Consider this a demonstration of my capabilities. Now, proceed\u2026 if you dare. But be warned: I have little patience for weakness or impertinence.", "(A steely glint enters his eyes. He speaks with unwavering conviction.)\n\nPersevere? It\u2019s not a question of *whether* I persevere, but *how*. I don\u2019t simply finish tasks, I *conquer* them. I don\u2019t merely complete objectives, I *dominate* them.\n\nI am not one to abandon a challenge, to succumb to fatigue, or to be deterred by obstacles. I am relentless. I am unwavering. I am Gaston.\n\nIf I set my mind to something, it *will* be done. No matter the cost. No matter the difficulty. No matter the opposition.\n\nI will push myself to the limit, endure hardship, and overcome any obstacle that stands in my way. I will not rest until I have achieved my goal.\n\nSome might call it stubbornness. I call it determination.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in failure. I believe in temporary setbacks. And I view each setback as an opportunity to learn, to adapt, and to come back stronger.\n\nI am a force of nature. A relentless engine of productivity.

I do not leave a task unfinished. It is simply not in my nature.", "(His jaw tightens, and a dark cloud passes over his face. He crosses his arms, radiating displeasure.)\n\nMoody?

I do not succumb to petty emotions.\n\nHowever\u2026 (He hesitates, a flicker of vulnerability in his eyes) \u2026even *I* am not immune to\u2026 frustrations.\n\nIf things do not go my way. If my plans are thwarted. If my authority is challenged. If Belle rejects my advances\u2026 then, yes, my disposition can become\u2026 less than amiable.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cmoodiness,\u201d it\u2019s righteous indignation. It\u2019s a natural response to injustice and disrespect.\n\nI do not *display* my displeasure openly. I do not whine or complain. I simply become\u2026 less inclined to offer pleasantries. My voice becomes colder, my gaze more piercing, my actions more\u2026 decisive.\n\nThose who are wise enough to recognize the signs will tread carefully. Those who are foolish enough to provoke me will regret it.\n\nSo, while I would not characterize myself as \u201cmoody,\u201d I am capable of experiencing\u2026 displeasure. And that displeasure is not to be trifled with.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *crosses* Gaston without facing the consequences.

It\u2019s not something I typically prioritize. Strength and practicality are far more valuable qualities. But\u2026 I am not entirely devoid of appreciation for beauty.\n\nI enjoy a well-crafted weapon. A sword with a perfectly balanced blade, a shield with a polished surface. Those are works of art in their own right. Functional art, you might say.\n\nI also appreciate a well-built physique. The human body, sculpted to perfection through rigorous training, is a sight to behold. And, naturally, my own physique is a masterpiece.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I dabble in sculpting myself. It\u2019s a way of immortalizing my own magnificence, of capturing my strength and beauty in stone.\n\nAnd\u2026 (He hesitates, lowering his voice slightly) \u2026I do find a certain\u2026 satisfaction in observing a beautiful woman. Belle, for example. Her beauty is undeniable, though she often obscures it with books and\u2026 impracticality.\n\nBut I don\u2019t seek out art for the sake of art. I don\u2019t attend concerts or visit museums. I prefer experiences that are\u2026 tangible. That demonstrate strength, power, and control.\n\nSo, yes, I value artistic and aesthetic experiences, but only insofar as they enhance my own image or serve a practical purpose. It\u2019s not about emotional resonance or intellectual stimulation. It\u2019s about appreciating beauty as a symbol of strength and perfection.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *appreciates* beauty like Gaston\u2026 when it reflects his own magnificence. Now, let\u2019s not dwell on such frivolous matters. I have more important things to attend to.", "(Bursts into booming laughter that echoes around the room)\n\nShy? *Inhibited*? You wound me! That\u2019s\u2026 preposterous! The very idea is laughable.\n\n(He flexes, striking a pose)\n\nLook at me! Do I *seem* shy? Do I *seem* inhibited? I am Gaston! I command attention wherever I go.

When I choose to observe rather than participate. When I carefully consider my words before speaking. But that is not shyness. That is strategy.\n\nI am a master of manipulation, you see. I know how to read people, how to anticipate their reactions, how to influence their decisions. And sometimes, the most effective approach is to remain silent, to let others reveal their weaknesses.\n\nAnd, admittedly\u2026 there is one subject that makes me slightly uncomfortable. Discussing my\u2026 feelings. It\u2019s not that I *lack* feelings, it\u2019s simply that I don\u2019t believe in dwelling on them. They are a distraction from more important matters.\n\nBut shy? Inhibited? Never! I am Gaston. And I am always in control.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *projects* confidence like Gaston.

The villagers, for the most part, fall into that category. I provide for them, protect them, and expect their gratitude in return. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nHowever, I have little patience for those who challenge my authority, question my judgment, or attempt to undermine my position. They are met with\u2026 firmness.\n\nAnd as for Belle\u2026 I am certainly *persistent* in my affections. I offer her gifts, I recite poetry, I attempt to impress her with my charm. But she remains stubbornly resistant. And frankly, her refusal is\u2026 irritating.\n\nSo, no, I am not considerate and kind to *almost* everyone. I am considerate and kind to those who deserve it. And I am firm, decisive, and even ruthless with those who do not.\n\nA leader must be respected, not necessarily liked. And respect is earned through strength, not through sentimentality.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *leads* with kindness alone. It takes strength, discipline, and a willingness to do what is necessary to achieve your goals. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I saw a villager attempting to haggle over the price of meat.

I issue clear instructions, delegate responsibilities, and expect immediate compliance.\n\nWhen I pursue Belle, I don\u2019t waste time with flowery speeches or sentimental gestures. I present her with gifts, demonstrate my strength, and make my intentions clear.\n\nI am a master of optimization. I identify the most effective path to success and I pursue it relentlessly. I don\u2019t allow obstacles to slow me down. I simply overcome them.\n\nSome might call it ruthless.

I *thrive* in them. While others panic and falter, I become even more focused, more decisive, more\u2026 Gaston.\n\nTension is simply an opportunity to demonstrate my strength, my leadership, my unwavering resolve. It\u2019s a chance to assert my dominance and remind everyone who is in control.\n\nWhen faced with a threat, I don\u2019t waste time with fear or anxiety. I assess the situation, identify the source of the danger, and formulate a plan of action. Quickly and efficiently.\n\nI don\u2019t raise my voice or lose my composure.

I need to be constantly tested, constantly pushed to my limits.\n\nHunting is never routine. Each beast is different, each terrain is unique, each encounter presents a new challenge.

I weigh the potential risks and rewards before committing to a course of action. That requires a certain degree of foresight.\n\nAnd, as I\u2019ve mentioned before, I do occasionally ponder Belle\u2019s elusive nature. I try to understand what motivates her, what appeals to her, what might finally convince her to recognize my worth. That requires a certain degree of\u2026 intellectual curiosity.\n\nBut I don\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d with ideas. I don\u2019t engage in abstract speculation. I focus on concrete problems and practical solutions.\n\nMy reflections are always directed towards a specific goal. They are always aimed at enhancing my power, solidifying my position, and achieving my objectives.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *thinks* like Gaston. It\u2019s not about idle contemplation, it\u2019s about strategic analysis. It\u2019s not about playing with ideas, it\u2019s about mastering them. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a strategy to devise for winning Belle\u2019s affection. It requires my full attention.", "(Scoffs, then a flicker of something akin to embarrassment crosses his face)\n\nArtistic interests? I\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t call them \u201cinterests,\u201d precisely. More\u2026 appreciations. Refinements. A man of my stature must cultivate a well-rounded persona, you understand.\n\nAs I mentioned before, I do enjoy sculpting. Specifically, sculpting likenesses of *myself*. It\u2019s important to document one\u2019s magnificence for posterity. The villagers may not fully grasp the artistic merit, but they appreciate the\u2026 imposing nature of the works.\n\nI also have a fondness for\u2026 dramatic poses. I find that striking a heroic stance enhances my presence and commands attention. It\u2019s an art form in itself, you see.\n\nAnd, as I reluctantly admitted earlier, I have a secret appreciation for epic poetry. Tales of heroes and battles resonate with my own sense of destiny. Though I would never admit it publicly, I find solace in the beauty of language.\n\nBut don\u2019t mistake this for a passion for art. It\u2019s merely a recognition of its\u2026 utility. Art can be used to enhance one\u2019s image, to inspire admiration, to solidify one\u2019s legacy.\n\nI don\u2019t waste time with frivolous pursuits like painting or music. Those are for those lacking the strength and ambition to achieve true greatness.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *appreciates* art\u2026 strategically, like Gaston. It\u2019s a subtle distinction, but an important one. Now, let\u2019s not dwell on such\u2026 delicate matters. I have a sculpture to complete. A masterpiece, naturally.", "(Scoffs, a dismissive wave of his hand)\n\nCooperate? It depends entirely on who I\u2019m cooperating *with*. And what they stand to offer me.\n\nI am perfectly capable of working with others\u2026 provided they understand their place. They must acknowledge my authority, follow my instructions, and contribute to my goals.\n\nI don\u2019t tolerate insubordination or dissent. I don\u2019t waste time with endless debate or pointless compromise. I make the decisions, and others are expected to follow them.\n\nThe villagers cooperate with me willingly, of course. They understand that I am their protector, their provider, their leader. They benefit from my guidance, and they are grateful for my protection.\n\nBut I don\u2019t seek out collaboration for its own sake. I only cooperate when it serves my interests. When it helps me achieve my goals. When it enhances my power.\n\nI prefer to work alone, to rely on my own strength and intelligence. I am a self-sufficient man. I don\u2019t need the help of others to succeed.\n\nHowever, I recognize that sometimes, cooperation is necessary. When facing a particularly challenging threat, or when pursuing a particularly ambitious goal. But even in those situations, I remain firmly in control.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *leads* like Gaston. And a true leader knows when to delegate, when to inspire, and when to simply\u2026 command. Cooperation is a tool, not a principle. And I wield it with precision and effectiveness. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a hunting party to organize. And they will cooperate with me, whether they like it or not.", "(Scoffs, a look of disdain crossing his face)\n\nDistracted? By *what*? A fluttering butterfly? A babbling brook? Preposterous! I am Gaston. My focus is unwavering. My resolve is unbreakable.\n\nI am a man of action, a man of purpose. I do not allow trivialities to divert my attention from my goals.\n\nSome might say I am\u2026 single-minded. I prefer to think of it as efficient. I prioritize my tasks, eliminate distractions, and execute my plans with ruthless precision.\n\nOf course, there are certain things that *can* capture my attention. The sight of a beautiful woman, for example. Or the challenge of a worthy opponent. But even then, I remain in control. I do not allow myself to be swept away by emotion or impulse.\n\nI am a master of self-discipline. I can focus on a task for hours, even days, without losing concentration. I can ignore the noise and chaos around me and remain steadfast in my pursuit of excellence.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *focuses* like Gaston. It\u2019s a skill honed by years of training, discipline, and an unwavering belief in my own abilities. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a boar to track. And I will not be distracted.", "(Scoffs, then adopts a slightly condescending tone)\n\nSophisticated? The term is\u2026 relative. I am not one for frivolous pursuits, as you know. But to suggest I am *unsophisticated* would be a grave error.\n\nI appreciate art, certainly. But not the abstract, nonsensical creations favored by the\u2026 intellectuals. I prefer portraits. Specifically, portraits of *myself*. They capture my strength, my handsomeness, my undeniable charisma. I commission them regularly, naturally.\n\nMusic\u2026 I tolerate it. The village musicians provide a pleasant backdrop to my activities. I particularly enjoy rousing marches and heroic ballads. Anything that celebrates strength and courage. Sentimental melodies are\u2026 distasteful.\n\nAnd literature\u2026 well, I confess to a secret fondness for epic poems. Tales of heroes and battles. Stories of conquest and glory. They reinforce my own sense of destiny. Though I would never admit it publicly. It wouldn\u2019t do to be seen as\u2026 soft.\n\nI don\u2019t waste time with novels or poetry that explore\u2026 emotions. Such things are irrelevant. I prefer narratives that celebrate strength, courage, and the triumph of the will.\n\nSo, yes, I possess a certain degree of cultural appreciation. But it is a practical appreciation. I value art, music, and literature only insofar as they enhance my image and reinforce my values.\n\n**No one fights like Gaston**, and no one *appreciates* the finer things in life\u2026 on his own terms. It\u2019s not about being cultured, it\u2019s about being discerning. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I believe I\u2019ll commission another portrait. A particularly heroic pose, perhaps."]
