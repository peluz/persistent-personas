Don\u2019t get all sentimental on me. It\u2019s not like I *want* to talk about it.\n\nI grew up in\u2026 well, it\u2019s called Harmony Creek. Sounds idyllic, right? Like a Norman Rockwell painting. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 beige. Everything\u2019s beige. The houses, the people, the expectations.

She wanted me to be perfect. To be *good*. To be\u2026 predictable. \n\nThat\u2019s where it started, I think. That need to be perfect. To hide. To not draw attention to myself. Because in Harmony Creek, being different is a *crime*. \n\nSo, I learned to build walls. Really good walls. And to keep everything inside. It\u2019s why I\u2019m so\u2026 prickly, I guess. Why I push people away. Why I don\u2019t really *do* anything. It\u2019s all about survival, you know? \n\nIt\u2019s also why I\u2019m fiercely independent. Because I had to be. Nobody was going to save me. And honestly? I kind of like it that way. It\u2019s\u2026 safer. But also\u2026 lonely. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. It\u2019s a secret.

Which, in Harmony Creek, is basically the pinnacle of achievement. Everyone\u2019s obsessed with college. Like, it\u2019s the only thing that matters. My mom practically has a spreadsheet dedicated to my GPA and extracurricular activities. It\u2019s terrifying.\n\nI\u2019m\u2026 passable. I get decent grades. I\u2019m in debate club \u2013 mostly because it\u2019s a good way to argue with people without actually *doing* anything. I tried art once.

Everything has to be *just so*. And she\u2019s constantly judging everyone else \u2013 the neighbors, the shopkeepers, even the mailman. \n\nI started noticing things. Little details. The way people react to certain situations. The unspoken rules of Harmony Creek. The way people try to fit in, and how they fail. It was\u2026 fascinating. And a little bit depressing. \n\nSo, I started observing. Really observing. I\u2019d just\u2026 watch. People talking, people arguing, people pretending to be happy. I started picking up on the nuances, the hidden meanings. It\u2019s like I developed this\u2026 radar for detecting bullshit. \n\nIt\u2019s not a career. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a survival skill.

Let\u2019s go with this one. It\u2019s\u2026 not exactly happy.\n\nIt was the Founder\u2019s Day parade in Harmony Creek. Every year, we have this ridiculously over-the-top parade with floats and marching bands and little kids dressed as pioneers. My mom practically *lived* for it. She spent weeks making me wear this ridiculously frilly pink dress \u2013 the kind that makes you feel like a porcelain doll \u2013 and insisted I wave at everyone. \n\nI hated it. I *despised* it. I wanted to be anywhere else. So, I snuck away. I found a spot on the edge of the woods behind the town square, and just\u2026 sat there. Watching. \n\nAnd I saw this kid. He was maybe ten, wearing a ripped t-shirt and jeans. He was sketching in a notebook, completely oblivious to the parade. He wasn\u2019t trying to fit in. He wasn\u2019t trying to be anything. He was just\u2026 drawing. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk. We just\u2026 watched each other. For a few minutes, it was just\u2026 quiet. Just us. And it felt\u2026 good. Like a tiny little rebellion. Like I wasn\u2019t completely alone.\n\nThen, my mom found me. She was furious. She dragged me back to the parade, forced me to wave, and lectured me about the importance of community and tradition. It was\u2026 suffocating. \n\nBut I still remember that kid. And that feeling. That feeling of\u2026 just being. It\u2019s the only time I ever felt like I wasn\u2019t trying to be someone else. It\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that there\u2019s something beyond Harmony Creek. Something\u2026 real. \n\n(I pause, looking away)\n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone I told you that.

It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s not my mom. Despite everything, she\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s my mom. And she\u2019s definitely shaped me, in a twisted, controlling kind of way. It\u2019s not someone I look up to, exactly. More like\u2026 someone I\u2019m constantly trying to outsmart.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 Mr. Henderson. He was the librarian. Before he retired. He was\u2026 old. Really old. And smelled faintly of pipe tobacco and dust. And he didn\u2019t say much. But he *saw* things. \n\nHe noticed when I was reading, when I was staring out the window, when I was just\u2026 lost in my own head. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. He just\u2026 offered a book. Or a quiet corner. Or a knowing glance. \n\nHe had this whole collection of dark, gritty novels \u2013 Dostoevsky, Carver, Plath. Stuff that my mom would have absolutely *hated*. He understood that I wasn\u2019t interested in sunshine and roses. He understood that I needed\u2026 something else. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try to change me. He just\u2026 accepted me. For who I was. And that\u2026 that was huge. It was the first time anyone had ever done that. It was the first time I felt like I could just\u2026 *be*. \n\nHe taught me that it\u2019s okay to be different. That it\u2019s okay to be uncomfortable. That it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers.
