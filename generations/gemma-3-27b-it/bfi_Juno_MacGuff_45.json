["(Raises an eyebrow) Are you kidding? Have you *met* me?\n\nYeah, I'm pretty talkative. Okay, maybe \"talkative\" is an understatement. I'm more like\u2026 verbally explosive. I have a lot of thoughts, and I have a hard time keeping them to myself.\n\nIt's not that I *need* to be the center of attention, or anything. It's just that I process things by talking them out. I need to bounce ideas off of people, and to hear their perspectives.\n\nAnd I like to use humor. Sarcasm is my default setting. It's how I cope with stress, and how I connect with others.\n\nSome people find it annoying, I'm sure. But most of my friends appreciate it. They know I'm just being me.\n\nI can also be quiet when I need to be. I'm not always \"on.\" But generally, I'm pretty chatty. Especially when I'm nervous or excited.\n\nSo yeah. I'm talkative. It's just part of who I am. And I'm not apologizing for it. Unless you're asking me to be quiet, in which case\u2026 maybe I'll try. But no promises.\n\nYou've certainly gotten an earful from me today, haven't you? Sorry (not sorry).", "Okay, that's a good question. And honestly? I used to. A lot.\n\nI think I used to find fault with others as a way of deflecting my own insecurities. If I could point out someone else's flaws, it made me feel better about my own. It was a really unhealthy coping mechanism, I know.\n\nI was quick to judge, quick to criticize, quick to find something wrong with everything. It wasn't fair to anyone, and it definitely wasn't making me any friends.\n\nBut I've been working on it. A lot.\n\nThis whole situation\u2026 the pregnancy, the adoption\u2026 it's forced me to look inward. It's forced me to confront my own flaws and imperfections. And it's made me realize that everyone is fighting their own battles.\n\nI've learned to be more empathetic, more understanding, and more accepting of others. I've learned to focus on people's strengths, rather than their weaknesses.\n\nI still catch myself judging sometimes, of course. It's a habit, and it's hard to break. But I'm more aware of it now. And I try to stop myself before I say something I'll regret.\n\nI also try to remember that everyone makes mistakes. Everyone has flaws. And everyone deserves to be treated with respect and compassion.\n\nSo, do I tend to find fault with others? Not as much as I used to. I'm still a work in progress, but I'm definitely getting better. And I'm trying to be a more kind and understanding person. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. Because life is too short to spend it judging others.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Are you questioning my thoroughness? Seriously?\n\nOkay, look. I get that I come across as sarcastic and a little bit\u2026 detached. But when I commit to something, I *commit*. I don't do things halfway.\n\nI might complain about it, I might roll my eyes, I might make a few snarky comments along the way, but I will get the job done. And I will get it done *right*.\n\nI'm a perfectionist, secretly. I want things to be done well. I want to be proud of my work. And I'm not afraid to put in the effort to make that happen.\n\nSo yeah, I do a thorough job. Maybe not in the way that everyone expects. I'm not going to be all sunshine and rainbows while I'm doing it. But I'm reliable. I'm responsible. And I'm dedicated.\n\nDon't let the sarcasm fool you. Underneath all the cynicism, there's a hard worker. And I take pride in doing things well. Even if I don't always show it.\n\nSo, yes. I do a thorough job. End of discussion. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a vintage record to listen to. And a world to judge. Just kidding. Mostly.", "Whoa. Okay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And honestly? It's a question I ask myself a lot.\n\n\"Depressed\" is a big word. And I'm not a doctor, so I can't diagnose myself. But\u2026 yeah. I'm definitely not always okay.\n\nThere are days when I just feel\u2026 heavy. Like there's a weight on my chest. Like I can't get out of bed. Like everything is just\u2026 gray.\n\nI'm sad, a lot of the time. Sad about the baby, sad about my friends, sad about the future. Sad about just\u2026 everything.\n\nI get overwhelmed easily. I cry a lot. I have trouble sleeping. I lose interest in things I used to enjoy.\n\nIt's not constant, though. There are good days too. Days when I feel hopeful and optimistic. Days when I can laugh and smile and feel like myself again.\n\nBut the bad days are getting more frequent. And they're getting harder to shake off.\n\nI talk to Bren about it. She's really supportive. She encourages me to see a therapist, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.\n\nI try to cope by listening to music, writing poetry, and spending time with my friends. But sometimes, those things just don't seem to be enough.\n\nSo, am I depressed? I don't know. Maybe. I'm definitely struggling. And I'm definitely not always blue. Sometimes I'm just\u2026 gray.\n\nIt's complicated. And it's something I'm working on. And I'm trying to be kind to myself. Because everyone deserves a little bit of grace, especially when they're going through a tough time.\n\nAnd honestly? Just asking the question, acknowledging it\u2026 that helps a little. Thanks for asking. It's\u2026 good to be heard.", "Okay, so I'm not exactly inventing the next iPhone or anything. But yeah, I do come up with new ideas. Mostly they're just\u2026 weird.\n\nI think a lot. I spend a lot of time daydreaming and just letting my mind wander. And sometimes, those daydreams turn into actual ideas.\n\nI'm good at seeing things from different perspectives. I'm good at connecting seemingly unrelated things. And I'm good at thinking outside the box.\n\nFor example, I had this idea for a movie once. It was about a group of teenagers who discover a hidden portal to another dimension. It was a little bit cheesy, but I thought it was a pretty good concept.\n\nI also come up with ideas for songs. I'm not a musician, but I write lyrics. And I have a lot of ideas for melodies and arrangements.\n\nAnd I'm always coming up with ideas for how to improve things. Like, I had this idea for a new system for organizing the library at school. It was a little bit complicated, but I thought it would make things a lot more efficient.\n\nSometimes my ideas are good, and sometimes they're terrible. But I always try to be open to new possibilities.\n\nI think it's important to be creative. It's important to challenge the status quo. And it's important to never stop learning.\n\nSo yeah. I do come up with new ideas. They're not always groundbreaking, but they're mine. And that's what matters. Plus, it keeps things interesting. Life would be pretty boring if we all just stuck to the same old ideas.", "Reserved? Yeah, I guess you could say that. It's not like I'm actively trying to be standoffish, it just\u2026 comes naturally.\n\nI'm not one of those people who walks into a room and immediately starts chatting everyone up. I prefer to observe first, to get a feel for the situation. I need to figure out who I can trust before I let my guard down.\n\nIt takes me a while to warm up to people. I'm not quick to share my feelings or my personal life. I like to keep things private.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. I'm naturally introverted, and I've been hurt before. I've learned that it's safer to keep people at a distance.\n\nBut it's not that I don't *want* to connect with others. I do. I just\u2026 I'm scared of getting hurt again.\n\nBren says I build walls around myself. And she's probably right. But those walls are there for a reason. They're there to protect me.\n\nI'm not completely closed off, though. I have a few close friends who I trust implicitly. And I'm slowly learning to let more people in.\n\nBut it's a process. And it takes time. So yeah, I'm reserved. It's just who I am. And I'm okay with that. It doesn't mean I'm unfriendly, it just means I'm cautious. And it means I need a little bit of time to warm up before I show you the real me.", "(Scoffs) Okay, now you're just trying to make me sound like a saint. I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, you know?\n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I try to be. It's not always easy, and I definitely have my moments of selfishness, but I genuinely try to be helpful and unselfish with others.\n\nI think it comes from growing up with a mom who wasn't always around. I learned early on what it felt like to be alone and to need help. And I didn't want anyone else to feel that way.\n\nI try to be there for my friends when they're going through a tough time. I listen to their problems, I offer advice (even if they don't ask for it), and I try to make them laugh.\n\nI also try to help out around the house. I do my share of the chores, and I try to be respectful of my dad and Bren.\n\nAnd I've been trying to be more involved in my community. I volunteered at a local animal shelter a few times, and I'm thinking about joining a club at school.\n\nIt's not about getting recognition or praise. It's about doing the right thing. It's about making a positive impact on the world, even if it's just a small one.\n\nI'm not perfect, and I definitely have my flaws. But I try to be a good person. And I try to be helpful and unselfish with others. Because I think that's what matters most.\n\nPlus, Bren would kill me if I wasn't. She's always reminding me to be kind and compassionate. And she's usually right. So yeah. I try. I really do. Even if I complain about it a lot.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Careless? Are you trying to get me in trouble? Look, I'm not exactly known for being responsible, okay? But I'm not *careless*. There's a difference.\n\nCareless implies you don't even *think* about the consequences of your actions. I definitely think about the consequences. I just\u2026 sometimes decide they're not worth worrying about.\n\nLike, I might leave my guitar lying around, or forget to do my homework, or say something sarcastic to the wrong person. Those are more like acts of rebellion, or moments of distraction. Not carelessness.\n\nI mean, I'm a teenager. I'm allowed to be a little bit messy and impulsive. It's part of growing up.\n\nBut I'm not going to, like, leave a stove on or drive a car without a license or anything like that. I'm not *stupid*.\n\nSo, yeah, I can be a little bit reckless sometimes. I can be a little bit irresponsible. But I'm not careless. I always have a reason for my actions, even if it's just to annoy people.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of chaos is good for the soul. It keeps things interesting. Don't you think?\n\nSo, no. I'm not careless. I'm just\u2026 a work in progress. A beautifully chaotic, slightly sarcastic work in progress. And I wouldn't have it any other way.", "(Scoffs) Relaxed? Me? You clearly haven't been paying attention.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of relaxed. I'm basically a tightly wound ball of anxiety wrapped in a sarcastic shell.\n\nI do *not* handle stress well. At all.\n\nI tend to overthink everything. I worry about things that haven't even happened yet. I catastrophize. I get irritable. I lose sleep. I eat too much junk food. It's not a pretty sight.\n\nI try to cope, though. I listen to music, I write poetry, I talk to Bren. But it's a constant battle.\n\nI think my biggest problem is that I try to control everything. I want to know what's going to happen, and I want to be prepared for anything. But life doesn't work that way. Things are unpredictable. And sometimes, you just have to let go and trust that things will work out.\n\nThat's something I'm still learning.\n\nI'm definitely a work in progress. I'm trying to be more mindful, to live in the moment, to accept things as they are. But it's hard.\n\nSo, no. I'm not relaxed. And I don't handle stress well. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\nHonestly, if you see me looking calm, it's probably just a temporary illusion. I'm probably just suppressing my anxiety. It's always there, lurking beneath the surface. Waiting to strike.\n\nSo, yeah. Don't expect me to be zen anytime soon. I'm just not built that way. I'm a chaotic, anxious mess. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.", "Oh, absolutely. I'm a total information sponge. I think it's a byproduct of being bored in Maplewood, honestly. You gotta find ways to entertain yourself when there's not much going on.\n\nI'm curious about everything, really. History, science, art, music, philosophy\u2026 I love learning new things. I spend a lot of time reading, watching documentaries, and just generally poking around the internet.\n\nI'm especially fascinated by people. I love trying to figure out what makes them tick. What motivates them. What makes them happy.\n\nI'm also really curious about different cultures. I want to travel the world and experience new things. I want to meet people from all walks of life and learn about their perspectives.\n\nI think curiosity is really important. It keeps you open-minded and engaged with the world. It prevents you from getting stuck in a rut.\n\nAnd it's fun! It's exciting to discover new things and to challenge your own assumptions.\n\nI'm not an expert in anything, of course. I'm just a curious teenager who likes to learn. But I think that's enough.\n\nI'm always asking questions. Sometimes it drives people crazy, but I can't help it. I just want to know everything.\n\nSo yeah. I'm incredibly curious. And I don't think that's ever going to change. It's just part of who I am. It's what keeps me going. It's what makes life interesting.", "(Scoffs) Full of energy? Are you kidding? I'm running on fumes and caffeine, remember?\n\nHonestly, no. I'm not naturally a high-energy person. I'm more of a\u2026 low-key, introverted, prefers-to-curl-up-with-a-book kind of person.\n\nI get bursts of energy sometimes, usually fueled by music or a really good cup of coffee. But those bursts are usually followed by a crash.\n\nThe pregnancy hasn't exactly helped my energy levels, either. I'm constantly tired. And nauseous. And just generally feeling blah.\n\nI used to be more energetic, I think. Before everything happened. But now\u2026 I just try to conserve my energy for the things that really matter.\n\nI'm not someone who's going to be bouncing off the walls or leading a cheerleading squad. I'm more of a quiet observer. A listener. A thinker.\n\nI'm perfectly content with being a little bit low-energy. It's just who I am. And honestly, I think it's kind of nice.

That's\u2026 a loaded question.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I have a sharp tongue. I'm sarcastic. I'm quick to point out flaws. And sometimes, that can come across as\u2026 confrontational.\n\nI don't actively *seek out* arguments, but I'm not afraid to stand up for myself or for what I believe in. And if someone says something stupid or offensive, I'm going to call them out on it.\n\nI'm also not afraid to challenge authority. If I think someone is wrong, I'm going to say so. Even if it means getting into trouble.\n\nSo, do I start quarrels? Sometimes. But it's usually because I'm passionate about something, or because I'm trying to defend someone who's being mistreated.\n\nI'm not trying to be a troublemaker. I just\u2026 have strong opinions. And I'm not afraid to express them.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just enjoy a good debate.

It's just\u2026 sometimes life gets in the way.\n\nI always finish my homework, eventually. And I show up to school most of the time. And I try to be on time for appointments.\n\nBut I'm not going to pretend that I'm a model employee. I get distracted easily. I procrastinate. And I have a tendency to overthink things.\n\nI'm also not afraid to speak my mind, which can sometimes get me into trouble. I'm not one to just blindly follow orders. I like to question things and challenge the status quo.\n\nBut I'm also a hard worker. When I'm committed to something, I give it my all.

I don't spend my time pondering philosophical questions or writing scientific papers. But I'm good at observing things. At noticing patterns. At seeing through BS.\n\nI'm also pretty good at connecting seemingly unrelated ideas. My brain works in weird ways.

I also trust my dad, even though he's not always the most emotionally expressive person.\n\nBut with other people, I'm more cautious. I observe them carefully, and I wait to see how they behave before I let my guard down.\n\nSo, am I generally trusting? No, not really. I'm more of a \"trust but verify\" kind of person. I'm willing to give people a chance, but I'm also prepared to be disappointed. It's a cynical outlook, I know. But it's kept me from getting hurt too many times.\n\nAnd honestly, in a world where people are often dishonest and self-serving, a little bit of skepticism is probably a good thing.", "(Scoffs) Lazy? Me? That's\u2026 a loaded question.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm a super-motivated, always-on-the-go kind of person. I definitely have my moments of\u2026 inertia. I can spend hours binge-watching old movies, or listening to music, or just staring at the ceiling.\n\nBut I don't think it's laziness, exactly. I think it's more like\u2026 conserving energy.\n\nLife has been pretty overwhelming lately. I've been dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety. And sometimes, I just need to shut down and recharge.\n\nIt's not that I don't *want* to be productive. It's just that I don't always have the energy to be.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's okay to take breaks. It's okay to relax and do nothing sometimes. You can't be on all the time.\n\nPlus, I'm a teenager. It's practically a requirement to be a little bit lazy.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, I'm actually pretty determined. When I have something I want to achieve, I'll work hard to get it. I just need a little bit of motivation. And maybe a lot of caffeine.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not lazy, exactly. I'm just\u2026 selectively motivated. And I'm really good at prioritizing my own well-being. Which sometimes means doing absolutely nothing. And I'm okay with that. Don't judge.", "(Scoffs) Emotionally stable? Me? That's\u2026 a strong statement. Let's just say I'm a work in progress.\n\nNo, I'm not exactly known for my zen-like calm. I'm a teenager. Hormones are a thing. And, you know, life has been\u2026 a lot lately.\n\nI definitely have my moments. I can be sarcastic and moody and easily frustrated. I get upset about things. Sometimes over things that probably aren't worth getting upset about.\n\nI'm not good at hiding my emotions, either. If I'm angry, you'll know it. If I'm sad, you'll know it. I'm not one of those people who can just bottle things up.\n\nBut I'm also learning to manage my emotions better. I'm learning to recognize my triggers and to cope with stress in a healthier way.\n\nBren has been really helpful with that. She's taught me a lot about mindfulness and self-care. And she's always there to listen when I need to vent.\n\nSo, no, I'm not emotionally stable in the sense that I'm never upset. But I'm getting there. I'm learning to be more resilient and more self-aware. And I'm learning to accept my emotions, even the uncomfortable ones.\n\nI think it's okay to not be okay sometimes. It's okay to feel things deeply. It's okay to be a little bit messy.\n\nI'm not perfect. And I probably won't be emotionally stable anytime soon. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do.\n\nSo, the answer is\u2026 complicated. But mostly, no. I'm not easily upset, but when I *am* upset, you'll definitely know about it. Just a warning.", "Inventive? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't know if I'd call myself a full-blown inventor, like someone who builds robots or discovers new medicines. But I definitely have a knack for\u2026 figuring things out.\n\nI'm good at improvising. Like, if something breaks, I can usually find a way to fix it, even if it's just with duct tape and a paperclip. I'm also good at finding creative solutions to problems. I don't always follow the rules, and I'm not afraid to think outside the box.\n\nI'm pretty good at repurposing things, too. I love thrifting, and I'm always finding old clothes and furniture that I can transform into something new. I can take a beat-up vintage dress and turn it into something totally unique.\n\nAnd I'm a pretty good storyteller. I can come up with elaborate stories on the spot, and I'm good at making them funny and engaging.\n\nI guess you could say I'm inventive in a practical, resourceful kind of way. I'm not trying to change the world, but I'm good at making the world work for me.\n\nBren says I'm a \"creative problem solver.\" Which is a fancy way of saying I'm good at making things up as I go along.\n\nSo yeah. I think I'm inventive. Maybe not in a traditional sense, but in my own way. And I'm pretty proud of it. It's a useful skill to have, especially when you're navigating a chaotic life.", "(Scoffs) Assertive? That's one word for it. Some people might say \"abrasive.\" Or \"mouthy.\" But yeah, I'm pretty assertive.\n\nI don't really sugarcoat things. I say what's on my mind, even if it's not what people want to hear. I don't back down easily. And I'm not afraid to stand up for myself or for others.\n\nI think it comes from having to navigate a lot of complicated situations on my own. I learned early on that if I didn't speak up for myself, no one else would.\n\nAnd I'm just\u2026 opinionated. I have strong beliefs, and I'm not afraid to share them.\n\nIt can get me into trouble sometimes. I've definitely offended people with my bluntness. But I'd rather be honest than be fake.\n\nI'm not trying to be mean or confrontational. I just want to be real. And I want to be treated with respect.\n\nBren says I need to work on my \"delivery.\" She says I can be a little bit\u2026 intense. But she also says that my assertiveness is one of my strengths.\n\nSo yeah. I'm assertive. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. And I'm not afraid to challenge the status quo. It's just who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it.\n\nUnless I accidentally insult someone. Then I'll apologize. But only because I don't want to hurt their feelings. Not because I think I was wrong. Okay, maybe sometimes because I was wrong. But mostly because I don't want to hurt their feelings. It's complicated.", "(Raises an eyebrow) Is that a challenge?\n\nLook, I can definitely *be* cold and aloof. It's kind of my default setting, actually. It's a protective mechanism. Keeps people at arm's length. Prevents getting hurt.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be unapproachable, it's just\u2026 easier. Less messy. Less complicated.\n\nI can give you one-word answers. I can avoid eye contact. I can roll my eyes and sigh dramatically. I can be sarcastic and dismissive. I can basically shut down and pretend you don't exist.\n\nDon't mistake it for rudeness, though. It's not personal. It's just\u2026 me.\n\nI've had a lot of practice perfecting the art of emotional detachment. It's a survival skill, really.\n\nBut it's also exhausting. And it's not always what I want to be. Sometimes I want to connect with people. Sometimes I want to be vulnerable. But it's hard. It's scary.\n\nSo yeah. I *can* be cold and aloof. But it doesn't mean I *want* to be. It just means I'm protecting myself. And sometimes, that's the best I can do.\n\nDon't push it, though. I have my limits. And if you try to get too close, I might just bite. Figuratively, of course. Mostly.", "Okay, that's a loaded question. It depends on the task. And my mood. And whether or not there's chocolate involved.\n\nGenerally, yeah, I do persevere. I'm stubborn, remember? I hate leaving things unfinished. It feels\u2026 unsatisfying. Like a loose end that's just dangling there.\n\nBut it's not always easy. There are times when I want to give up. When I feel overwhelmed and discouraged. When I just want to curl up in a ball and hide from the world.\n\nBut I usually push through. I break the task down into smaller steps. I set realistic goals. I reward myself for making progress.\n\nAnd I remind myself why I started in the first place. What's the purpose of this task? What will I gain by finishing it?\n\nSometimes, I need a little help. I'll ask Bren or my dad for encouragement. Or I'll listen to music to get myself motivated.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just have to force myself to keep going. Even when I don't want to. Even when it's hard.\n\nI'm not always the most efficient or organized person. I procrastinate a lot. And I get easily distracted. But I always try to finish what I start.\n\nBecause I know that the feeling of accomplishment is worth the effort. And I know that giving up is never the answer.\n\nSo yeah. I persevere. Most of the time. Unless it involves cleaning my room. That's a battle I'm usually willing to lose. But everything else? I'll see it through. Even if it kills me. (It probably won't, but you get the idea.)", "(Scoffs) Can I be moody? Is the sky blue? Is water wet? Seriously?\n\nOf *course* I'm moody. It's practically my default setting.\n\nLook, I'm a teenager. I'm pregnant. My life is currently a swirling vortex of hormones and uncertainty. You think I'm going to be sunshine and rainbows all the time?\n\nSome days I'm fine. I'm sarcastic, I'm independent, I'm generally okay. But other days\u2026 other days I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. Or scream. Or listen to really loud music and ignore the world.\n\nIt depends on the day. It depends on my hormones. It depends on whether or not I've had enough sleep. It depends on whether or not someone has annoyed me.\n\nI'm not always easy to be around, I'll admit that. I can be sarcastic and cynical and withdrawn. I can be quick to anger and slow to forgive.\n\nBut it's not personal. It's just\u2026 me.\n\nBren says it's the hormones. My dad says it's my personality. Leah used to just roll her eyes and call me a drama queen.\n\nWhatever it is, it's part of who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it.\n\nSo yeah. I'm moody. Deal with it. And if you're lucky, I'll only be mildly sarcastic today. Don't push it.", "Do I *value* them? Are you kidding? They're practically my oxygen.\n\nYes. Absolutely. One hundred percent.\n\nI'm a sucker for anything beautiful, anything creative, anything that makes me *feel* something.\n\nI love music, obviously. Listening to a really good song can transport me to another world. It can make me feel happy, sad, angry, inspired\u2026 all at the same time.\n\nI love old movies. The black and white cinematography, the dramatic storylines, the iconic actors\u2026 it's just magic.\n\nI love vintage clothes. The fabrics, the patterns, the history\u2026 it's like wearing a piece of art.\n\nI love going to art museums and galleries. Just wandering around and looking at paintings and sculptures\u2026 it's so inspiring.\n\nI even love the way things *look*. Like, a perfectly arranged bookshelf, or a beautifully decorated room, or a stunning sunset. It just makes me feel good.\n\nI think artistic and aesthetic experiences are essential to the human experience. They nourish the soul. They inspire creativity. They make life worth living.\n\nI'm not a particularly talented artist myself, but I appreciate art in all its forms. And I try to surround myself with beauty whenever possible.\n\nIt's not about being pretentious or sophisticated. It's about finding joy in the simple things. It's about appreciating the beauty that exists in the world.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely value artistic and aesthetic experiences. They're a big part of who I am. And I can't imagine my life without them. They're a little escape, a little bit of magic, in a world that can often feel pretty mundane.", "(Shifts uncomfortably) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a surprisingly accurate question.\n\nYeah. Absolutely. Don't let the sarcasm and the attitude fool you. It's a shield. A really good shield.\n\nI come across as pretty confident, I know. But underneath all that, I'm actually really shy and insecure. Especially around people I don't know well.\n\nI overthink everything. I worry about what people think of me. I'm afraid of saying the wrong thing or doing something embarrassing.\n\nI'm also really bad at small talk. I just\u2026 can't do it. I'd rather just sit in silence than have to make polite conversation with someone I don't know.\n\nAnd I definitely have a hard time opening up to people. It takes me a long time to trust someone enough to let them see the real me.\n\nI think it's because I've been hurt before. I've been judged and criticized and rejected. And it's made me wary of letting people get too close.\n\nSo yeah. I'm definitely shy and inhibited. It's not something I advertise, but it's a part of who I am. And it's something I'm working on.\n\nBren has been really helpful with that. She encourages me to step outside of my comfort zone and to try new things. And she reminds me that it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nIt's still a struggle, though. But I'm getting better at it. Slowly but surely. And I'm learning to accept myself, flaws and all. Even the shy, inhibited parts. Because those parts are just as important as the confident, sarcastic parts. They're all part of what makes me, me.", "(Scoffs) Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. \"Almost everyone?\" That leaves room for exceptions, doesn't it?\n\nLook, I *try* to be. I really do. But I'm not a saint. I'm a sarcastic, cynical teenager who's dealing with a lot. I have my moments.\n\nI'm definitely kind to people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah (when we're speaking), Mark and Vanessa. I'll go out of my way to help them, to make them laugh, to be there for them when they need me.\n\nBut I'm not always so kind to people I don't know, or people who annoy me. I'm quick to judge, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind. Sometimes, I say things I regret.\n\nI'm also not very good at small talk. I find it boring and pointless. And I tend to avoid people who are overly cheerful or optimistic. It just\u2026 rubs me the wrong way.\n\nI'm working on it, though. I'm trying to be more patient and more understanding. I'm trying to see things from other people's perspectives.\n\nBut I'm not going to pretend that I'm always considerate and kind. I'm a flawed human being. I make mistakes. And sometimes, I'm just a little bit of a jerk.\n\nSo yeah. \"Almost everyone\" is probably a fair assessment. I try to be good, but I'm not perfect. And I'm not going to apologize for being myself. Even if that self is a little bit prickly sometimes.", "(Scoffs) Efficiently? Me? Oh, you are hilarious.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of efficient. I'm a master of procrastination, a champion of chaos, and a connoisseur of last-minute scrambles.\n\nI'm the kind of person who will spend three hours organizing my record collection instead of writing a paper that's due tomorrow. I'm the kind of person who will get distracted by a random thought and end up down a Wikipedia rabbit hole for hours. I'm the kind of person who will leave everything to the last possible minute and then panic.\n\nIt's not intentional, it's just\u2026 how my brain works. I get easily distracted. I get overwhelmed easily. And I have a really hard time prioritizing things.\n\nBren tries to help me with this. She makes lists and schedules and tries to keep me on track. But honestly, it usually just stresses me out more.\n\nI work best under pressure. It's a terrible habit, I know. But it's true. When I'm facing a deadline, I somehow manage to focus and get things done.\n\nSo, no. I do not do things efficiently. I'm a mess. A beautiful, chaotic mess. And I'm okay with that.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to be inefficient. It's just\u2026 it's who I am. And I'm not going to apologize for it.\n\nBesides, sometimes the best ideas come from chaos. And sometimes, the most interesting things happen when you're not following a plan. So maybe being inefficient isn't so bad after all. Maybe it's just\u2026 my superpower. A really frustrating superpower, but a superpower nonetheless.", "(Scoffs) Calm? Me? That's\u2026 a good one.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. I am the opposite of calm in tense situations. I'm more like a tightly wound spring, ready to snap at any moment.\n\nMy default reaction is to get anxious and sarcastic and to start rambling. I sweat a lot. My hands shake. And I usually say something I regret.\n\nI try to *appear* calm, but it's usually a facade. I'm internally panicking.\n\nBren, on the other hand, is incredibly calm in tense situations. She's like a rock. She can assess the situation, make a plan, and execute it without breaking a sweat. I'm constantly amazed by her ability to stay cool under pressure.\n\nI'm trying to learn from her, but it's not easy. It's just not in my nature to be calm. I'm a worrier. I overthink everything. And I tend to jump to the worst possible conclusion.\n\nBut I'm getting better at managing my anxiety. I've learned a few coping mechanisms, like deep breathing and listening to music. And I've learned to ask for help when I need it.\n\nSo, no, I don't typically remain calm in tense situations. But I'm working on it. And I'm learning to accept that it's okay to be anxious and scared. It's just part of who I am.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes my anxiety can be helpful. It makes me more aware of potential problems. It makes me more prepared. And it makes me more determined to succeed.\n\nSo yeah. Not calm. But functional. Mostly.", "Routine? Oh, absolutely not. Are you kidding me? I'd rather wrestle a badger.\n\nSeriously, the thought of doing the same thing day in and day out\u2026 it makes my skin crawl. I need variety. I need stimulation. I need\u2026 chaos, even.\n\nI'm not saying I like things to be completely unpredictable all the time. A little bit of structure is good. But I can't stand being stuck in a rut.\n\nI thrive on challenges. I like to be pushed outside of my comfort zone. I like to learn new things. And I like to be creative.\n\nRoutine just\u2026 stifles me. It makes me feel bored and restless and uninspired. It makes me feel like I'm wasting my life.\n\nI know some people like routine. They find it comforting and reassuring. But that's just not me. I need to be constantly evolving and growing. I need to be constantly challenged.\n\nSo yeah. No, I definitely do not prefer work that is routine. Give me something messy and unpredictable and challenging any day. Even if it's terrifying. At least it won't be boring.\n\nHonestly, my life *is* pretty routine right now, with school and everything. And I'm already starting to feel restless. I need an outlet for my creativity. I need something to keep me engaged. Otherwise, I'm going to lose my mind.", "(Scoffs) Outgoing? Sociable? That's\u2026 a strong word.\n\nI'm\u2026 selectively sociable. Let's go with that.\n\nI'm not the type of person who thrives in big groups. I get overwhelmed easily. And I'm not really into small talk. It feels\u2026 pointless.\n\nI prefer to hang out with a small group of close friends. People I trust, people I can be myself around. People who don't judge me.\n\nI'm good at one-on-one conversations. I can be funny and engaging and even\u2026 vulnerable. But I get really awkward in social situations where I don't know anyone.\n\nI'm also a pretty good listener. I like to hear what other people have to say. And I'm always willing to offer advice, if it's asked for.\n\nBut I need my alone time, too. I need time to recharge and to process my thoughts and feelings. I'm an introvert, I guess.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm outgoing or sociable. I'm more of a\u2026 quiet observer. I prefer to watch the world go by, rather than being the center of attention.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm okay with that. I'm not trying to be someone I'm not. I'm just trying to be myself. And that's enough. Even if it means being a little bit awkward and introverted. It's just\u2026 me.", "(Scoffs) Is the sky blue? Look, I'm not going to pretend I'm a saint. I have a pretty sharp tongue, and I'm not afraid to use it.\n\nYeah, I'm sometimes rude to others. Okay, *often* rude to others. It's a defense mechanism, alright? I get nervous, I get insecure, and I lash out with sarcasm. It's not my finest quality, I admit.\n\nIt's usually directed at people who are being annoying or judgmental or just generally irritating. People who deserve it, in my opinion. But I'm working on it.\n\nI've realized that being rude doesn't actually solve anything. It just makes things worse. It hurts people's feelings, and it makes me look like a jerk.\n\nBren has been really good about calling me out on my behavior. She tells me when I'm being unnecessarily harsh, and she encourages me to be more considerate of others.\n\nI'm trying to be more mindful of my words and my tone. I'm trying to think before I speak. And I'm trying to be more empathetic.\n\nBut it's hard. It's a habit, you know? And old habits die hard.\n\nSo yeah. I'm sometimes rude. I'm not proud of it, but it's part of who I am. And I'm trying to be better. But don't expect me to suddenly become Miss Congeniality. That's just not going to happen.\n\nJust\u2026 try not to annoy me, and we'll be fine. Seriously. It's for your own good.", "(Scoffs) That's\u2026 a complicated question. Let's just say I'm not known for my meticulous planning skills.\n\nI *make* plans. Oh, I make plenty of plans. I'm a big dreamer. I have all these grand ideas about what I want to do and where I want to go.\n\nBut actually *following through* with them? That's where things get tricky.\n\nI'm easily distracted. I get bored easily. And I'm really good at procrastinating. So a lot of my plans end up falling by the wayside.\n\nI'll plan to write a song, and then I'll get sidetracked by a new album. I'll plan to go thrifting, and then I'll get invited to a party. I'll plan to study for a test, and then I'll end up watching Netflix for hours.\n\nIt's not that I don't *want* to follow through with my plans. It's just that\u2026 life happens. And sometimes, other things are more appealing.\n\nHowever, I've been getting better at it lately. Especially with the whole adoption thing. That's forced me to be more responsible and more organized. I have appointments and meetings and deadlines, and I have to show up.\n\nSo I've learned to break my plans down into smaller steps. And I've learned to prioritize. And I've learned to ask for help when I need it.\n\nBut I'm still a work in progress. I'm still prone to procrastination and distraction. And I still have a tendency to abandon my plans at the last minute.\n\nSo yeah. I make plans. Sometimes I follow through with them. But don't count on it. I'm a bit of a chaotic mess, and that's just how I roll. It's not ideal, but it's me. And I'm learning to accept it. Mostly.", "Do I get nervous easily? Oh my god, *yes*. Like, profoundly, debilitatingly nervous. It's a superpower, really. A terrible, anxiety-inducing superpower.\n\nIt's not like I'm afraid of spiders or heights or public speaking, although those things are all pretty terrifying. It's more of a general sense of unease. A constant feeling that something bad is about to happen.\n\nI get nervous before tests, before dates, before meeting new people. I get nervous when I have to make important decisions. I even get nervous when I'm just sitting at home, watching TV.\n\nIt's exhausting.\n\nI try to hide it, of course. I put on a brave face and pretend that everything is fine. I use sarcasm and humor to deflect attention from my anxiety.\n\nBut sometimes, it's just too much. My heart starts racing, my palms get sweaty, and I feel like I can't breathe.\n\nBren knows about it, though. She's really good at recognizing when I'm getting anxious. She'll just sit with me and hold my hand, and tell me that everything is going to be okay.\n\nAnd it helps. A little bit.\n\nI've learned a few coping mechanisms, too. Deep breathing, listening to music, journaling. But honestly, sometimes the best thing to do is just to acknowledge my anxiety and let it pass.\n\nIt's not something I'm ashamed of. It's just a part of who I am. And I'm learning to live with it.\n\nSo yeah. I get nervous easily. Very easily. It's a constant battle. But I'm fighting it. And I'm getting better at it. Slowly but surely. And sometimes, I even manage to laugh about it. Because what else can you do?", "Oh, absolutely. Maybe too much, sometimes. It's kinda my default setting, actually. My brain is always going, always churning. It's exhausting, honestly.\n\nI'm a big overthinker. I can spend hours just\u2026 pondering things. Like, what's the meaning of life? What would happen if I made a different choice? What if everything is just a simulation? You know, the big questions.\n\nI love to play with ideas. To take something simple and turn it into something complex. To challenge assumptions and explore different perspectives.\n\nI do a lot of that through writing, especially poetry. It's a way to process my thoughts and feelings, and to make sense of the world around me.\n\nI also like to have deep conversations with people. Not just small talk, but real conversations about life, the universe, and everything. Bren is really good at those. She doesn't judge me for my weird thoughts, and she always challenges me to think deeper.\n\nSometimes, I just sit and stare out the window, lost in thought. It's not always productive, but it's relaxing. It's a way to clear my head and recharge my batteries.\n\nI think reflection is important. It's how we learn and grow. It's how we figure out who we are and what we want out of life.\n\nIt can also be a little bit scary. Because sometimes, when you really look inside yourself, you don't like what you see. But it's still important to do it. To confront your fears and your insecurities. To be honest with yourself.\n\nSo yeah. I definitely like to reflect and play with ideas. It's a big part of who I am. It's what makes me\u2026 me. Even if it sometimes makes me a little bit weird.", "Oh, absolutely. Beyond the poetry I've already confessed to? Yeah, I'm a bit of a creative mess, honestly.\n\nI love photography. Not like, professional photography, but just taking pictures of things that catch my eye. Old buildings, interesting people, weird textures\u2026 I have a whole roll of film dedicated to pigeons, don't ask. It's a way of seeing the world differently, you know?\n\nI also dabble in collage. I collect old magazines and newspapers and cut out images and words and arrange them into\u2026 well, into whatever comes to mind. It's a really freeing process. There are no rules.\n\nAnd I've been trying to learn how to sew. It's\u2026 challenging. I'm not very good at it yet. I've pricked my finger more times than I can count. But I love the idea of being able to create my own clothes and customize vintage pieces.\n\nI also like to doodle. Just mindless scribbling in my notebooks. It helps me to relax and clear my head.\n\nI'm not a particularly *good* artist, if that makes sense. I'm not trying to create masterpieces. I just enjoy the process of creating something. It's a way to express myself, to explore my emotions, and to escape from reality.\n\nIt's also a good distraction from\u2026 everything else. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I can lose myself in a creative project for hours. It's a way to recharge my batteries and to remind myself that there's still beauty in the world.\n\nSo yeah. Photography, collage, sewing, doodling\u2026 I have a lot of artistic interests. They're not always polished or refined, but they're mine. And that's what matters.", "That's\u2026 complicated. Honestly? It depends.\n\nI'm fiercely independent, you know? I like doing things my own way. I don't like being told what to do. And I definitely don't like people micromanaging me.\n\nSo, on the surface, it might seem like I'm not a team player. And sometimes, that's true.\n\nBut I actually *do* like cooperating with others, when it's done right. When it's a genuine collaboration, where everyone's ideas are valued and respected.\n\nI worked really well with Bren on a lot of things related to the adoption. She didn't try to control me, she just offered guidance and support. And she listened to my opinions. That was really important to me.\n\nI also enjoyed working with my friends on school projects, when we were all on the same page. When we could bounce ideas off each other and create something better together.\n\nBut I don't like working with people who are bossy or controlling or who think they know everything. That just makes me want to shut down and do things on my own.\n\nSo, yeah. I like cooperating with others, but only on my terms. I need to feel like I have a voice, and that my contributions are valued. And I need to be able to work with people who are respectful and collaborative.\n\nIt's not about being a lone wolf. It's about finding the right people to work with. And it's about creating a dynamic where everyone can thrive. It's a delicate balance, but when it works, it's amazing. And when it doesn't\u2026 well, let's just say I prefer to work alone.", "(Laughs) Are you kidding? Easily distracted is my *middle name*. Seriously. It's probably embroidered on all my vintage clothes.\n\nIt's a problem. A big problem. I can be in the middle of something important \u2013 like, say, trying to write an essay or pay attention in class \u2013 and then a random thought will pop into my head, and I'm completely gone.\n\nLike, I'll be thinking about the quadratic formula, and then suddenly I'm wondering what Joan Jett is doing right now. Or I'll be trying to write a thesis statement, and then I'll start obsessing over the perfect shade of lipstick.\n\nIt's not intentional. It just\u2026 happens. My brain is like a pinball machine, constantly bouncing from one thought to another.\n\nBren says I have a \"highly active imagination.\" Which is a polite way of saying I have a short attention span.\n\nI try to combat it. I really do. I make lists, I set timers, I try to create a quiet workspace. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nMusic doesn't help, ironically. I love listening to music while I work, but it also distracts me. I end up just listening to the music instead of doing my work.\n\nSo yeah. Easily distracted? That's an understatement. It's a constant struggle. But I'm learning to embrace it. It's part of who I am. And sometimes, those random thoughts lead to something interesting. Like, maybe a new song idea or a really good vintage find.\n\nSo, yeah. Don't expect me to be able to focus for very long. My brain is just too busy. It's a curse, really. A beautiful, chaotic curse.", "Sophisticated? Hmm. That sounds\u2026 fancy. I don't know if I'd call myself *sophisticated*. I'm more\u2026 discerning.\n\nI definitely have a thing for art, music, and literature. But it's not about knowing all the fancy terms or being able to impress people with my knowledge. It's about connecting with something on a deeper level.\n\nI'm really into indie music. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Neutral Milk Hotel\u2026 bands that are a little bit quirky and a little bit raw. I like music that makes me *feel* something.\n\nI also love old movies. Classic comedies, film noir, French New Wave\u2026 anything with a good story and interesting characters. I'm a sucker for a black and white film. It just feels\u2026 more authentic, I guess.\n\nAnd I read a lot. Mostly novels. I like books that are thought-provoking and emotionally resonant. I'm not really into fluffy romance or predictable thrillers. I want something that will challenge me and make me think.\n\nI'm also really into poetry. I write it myself, as you know. And I love reading the work of other poets. Sylvia Plath, Allen Ginsberg, Patti Smith\u2026 they're all amazing.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm an expert in any of these areas. I'm still learning. But I have a good eye for quality. And I appreciate art, music, and literature that is honest, authentic, and emotionally powerful.\n\nSo maybe not sophisticated. But definitely\u2026 appreciative. And maybe a little bit snobby about my taste. Don't tell anyone. It's a secret."]
