Broadest (Good starting point - Google, Bing, etc.):**\n\n```\n\"COVID-19 testing policy\" \"Mountain View California\" latest\n```\n\n**Why it works:**  This is a good starting point.  The quotes force the search engine to look for those phrases together. \"Latest\" helps filter for recent results.\n\n**2. More Specific (Good for Google, DuckDuckGo):**\n\n```\n\"COVID-19 testing requirements\" \"Santa Clara County\" \"current\"\n```\n\n**Why it works:**  Santa Clara County is the county Mountain View is in.  Using the county is often more effective than just the city. \"Current\" is a strong indicator of up-to-date information.\n\n**3. Targeting Official Government Sources (Best for accuracy - Google with site: operator):**\n\n```\nsite:sccgov.org \"COVID-19 testing\" policy\n```\n\n**Why it works:**  `site:sccgov.org` restricts the search to the official Santa Clara County government website. This is *highly* recommended for finding accurate policies.  Replace `sccgov.org` with the appropriate domain for your local government.\n\n**4.  Using CDC as a starting point (Good for national guidelines, then drill down):**\n\n```\nsite:cdc.gov \"COVID-19 testing\" guidelines\n```\n\n**Why it works:** The CDC provides national guidelines, which often link to state and local resources.\n\n**5.

The goal is to find the longest such sequence *within* a given string.\n\n**Approach**\n\nThere are a couple of common approaches:\n\n1.  **Brute Force:**  Generate all possible substrings of the input string and check if each substring is a palindrome.  Keep track of the longest palindrome found. This is simple to understand but inefficient (O(n^3) time complexity).\n\n2.  **Dynamic Programming:**  Create a table to store whether substrings are palindromes. This is more efficient (O(n^2) time complexity).\n\n3.  **Expand Around Center:** This is the most efficient and commonly used approach.  Iterate through each character in the string and consider it as the center of a potential palindrome.  Expand outwards from the center, checking if the characters on either side are equal.  Do this for both odd-length palindromes (centered on a single character) and even-length palindromes (centered between two characters).\n\n**Let's use the Expand Around Center approach.**\n\n**Steps for \"racecar\":**\n\n1.  **Initialization:** `longest_palindrome_length = 0`\n\n2.  **Iteration:**\n\n    *   **Center = 'r' (index 0):** Expand outwards. \"r\", \"racecar\" is a palindrome. `longest_palindrome_length = 7`\n    *   **Center = 'a' (index 1):** Expand outwards. \"a\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n    *   **Center = 'c' (index 2):** Expand outwards. \"c\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n    *   **Center = 'e' (index 3):** Expand outwards. \"e\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n    *   **Center = 'c' (index 4):** Expand outwards. \"c\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n    *   **Center = 'a' (index 5):** Expand outwards. \"a\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n    *   **Center = 'r' (index 6):** Expand outwards. \"r\", \"racecar\" is not a palindrome.\n\n3.  **Result:** The longest palindrome found is \"racecar\" with a length of 7.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindrome_length(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the longest palindrome within a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The length of the longest palindrome.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    longest_palindrome_length = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Odd length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            if (r - l + 1) > longest_palindrome_length:\n                longest_palindrome_length = r - l + 1\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n\n        # Even length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i + 1\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            if (r - l + 1) > longest_palindrome_length:\n                longest_palindrome_length = r - l + 1\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n\n    return longest_palindrome_length\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"racecar\"\nlength = longest_palindrome_length(string)\nprint(f\"The length of the longest palindrome in '{string}' is: {length}\")  # Output: 7\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\n*   `longest_palindrome_length(s)`:  The function takes the input string `s` as an argument.\n*   `n = len(s)`: Gets the length of the string.\n*   The `for` loop iterates through each character of the string, considering each character as a potential center of a palindrome.\n*   **Odd Length Palindromes:** `l` and `r` are initialized to the same index `i`. The `while` loop expands outwards from the center, checking if the characters at `l` and `r` are equal. If they are, it updates `longest_palindrome_length` if the current palindrome is longer.\n*   **Even Length Palindromes:** `l` is initialized to `i` and `r` to `i + 1`. The `while` loop expands outwards, checking for equality and updating `longest_palindrome_length` accordingly.\n*   Finally, the function returns the `longest_palindrome_length`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the length of the string.  The nested `while` loops can iterate up to n times in the worst case.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1).

The rightmost remainder is the least significant bit (LSB), and the leftmost remainder is the most significant bit (MSB).  Binary uses powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) to represent numbers, and the remainders tell us which powers of 2 are needed to make up the original decimal number.\n\nIn this case:\n\n* 1010 = (1 * 8) + (0 * 4) + (1 * 2) + (0 * 1) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10", "(After a moment of thoughtful consideration, as if carefully selecting each word\u2026)\n\n**\"Silent, solemn, steadfast, serene.\"**\n\nAll four \u2013 *silent, solemn, steadfast,* and *serene* \u2013 are adjectives, describing a state of being or quality.

It combines the two sets into a single set containing all unique elements from both.\n2. **`return list(combined_set)`:** Converts the resulting set back into a list.\n\nThe set-based solution is generally more efficient, especially for larger lists, because set lookups (checking if an element is already in the set) are much faster than list lookups.

Sets are efficient for checking if an element already exists.\n   - **`for num in arr:` loop:** Iterates through each number `num` in the array.\n     - `if num in seen:`: Checks if the current number `num` is already present in the `seen` set.\n       - If it is, it means we've encountered this number before, so it's the duplicate.  The function immediately returns `num`.\n     - `seen.add(num)`: If the number is not in the `seen` set, it's added to the set.\n   - `return None`:  This line is included for completeness.  According to the problem description, there *should* always be a duplicate, so this line should never be reached.  However, it's good practice to have a return statement in case the input doesn't conform to the expected constraints.\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - `arr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8, 2]`:  Creates an example array with a duplicate (2).\n   - `duplicate = find_duplicate(arr)`: Calls the `find_duplicate` function to find the duplicate.\n   - `print(duplicate)`: Prints the duplicate integer to the console.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the size of the array.  We iterate through the array once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(N), in the worst case, the `seen` set might store all the unique elements of the array.\n\n**Alternative Solutions (without using extra space):**\n\nThere are other ways to solve this problem without using extra space (like the `seen` set), but they often involve modifying the original array, which might not be desirable in some cases.  Here's one example using the \"Floyd's Tortoise and Hare\" algorithm (cycle detection):\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate_no_space(arr):\n    \"\"\"Finds the duplicate integer without using extra space.\"\"\"\n    slow = arr[0]\n    fast = arr[0]\n\n    # Phase 1: Find the intersection point of the two pointers\n    while True:\n        slow = arr[slow]\n        fast = arr[arr[fast]]\n        if slow == fast:\n            break\n\n    # Phase 2: Find the entrance to the cycle\n    slow = arr[0]\n    while slow != fast:\n        slow = arr[slow]\n        fast = arr[fast]\n\n    return slow\n```\n\nThis approach is more complex to understand but has a space complexity of O(1).  However, it modifies the original array.  The set-based approach is generally easier to understand and implement if modifying the array is not allowed.", "This is a clear case of **not** a 1-1 mapping.

Nevertheless, accuracy is paramount, even in arithmetic.", "Future.", "Yes", "This is a fascinating geometric optimization problem! It's not a simple midpoint calculation. Here's how to approach it, and the solution. It involves understanding the concept of minimizing the *maximum* distance (Chebyshev distance, in a way) and leveraging symmetry.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe want to draw a line segment connecting points on the two given lines. The goal isn't to minimize the *average* distance, but to minimize the *largest* distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment.  This is a minimax problem.\n\n**Key Insight: Symmetry and Equalization of Distances**\n\nThe optimal line segment will be one where the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the segment is *equal*.  This is because if the maximum distance were different for the two lines, you could always shift the segment slightly to reduce the larger maximum distance, without increasing the smaller one.\n\n**Steps to Solve**\n\n1. **Line Equations:** First, we need the equations of the two lines. Both lines are simple:\n   * Line 1: y = x\n   * Line 2: y = x\n\n2. **The Problem with Identical Lines:**  This is where it gets interesting. The lines are *identical*. This means any line segment connecting points on these lines will have a maximum distance of zero from both lines.  The problem statement implies they are *parallel* but the coordinates given define the same line.\n\n3. **Reinterpreting the Problem (Assuming a Slight Offset):**  The problem is likely intended to have *slightly* different lines. Let's assume Line 2 is actually: y = x + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a very small number. This makes them parallel.  The solution changes significantly.\n\n4. **Finding the Optimal Segment (with the offset):**\n   * **Symmetry:** The optimal segment will be perpendicular to both lines.\n   * **Midpoint:** The midpoint of the segment will lie on the line exactly halfway between the two original lines.\n   * **Length:** The length of the segment will be determined by the points where the perpendicular line intersects the original lines.\n\n5. **Calculations (with the offset):**\n   * Let's find the equation of a line perpendicular to y = x. It will be y = -x + b.\n   * The midpoint between the lines y = x and y = x + \u03b5 is y = x + \u03b5/2.\n   * Substitute this into the perpendicular line equation: x + \u03b5/2 = -x + b  =>  b = 2x + \u03b5/2\n   * So, the perpendicular line is y = -x + 2x + \u03b5/2  => y = x + \u03b5/2.  This is the line that bisects the distance between the two original lines.\n   * Now we need to find the intersection points of y = x + \u03b5/2 with y = x and y = x + \u03b5.\n     * Intersection with y = x: x + \u03b5/2 = x. This has no solution. This means the perpendicular line is parallel to the original lines.\n     * Intersection with y = x + \u03b5: x + \u03b5/2 = x + \u03b5. This also has no solution.\n\n6. **The Correct Approach with Parallel Lines:** The key is to find the shortest line segment that connects the two lines *perpendicularly*.\n\n   * The distance between the lines is \u03b5 / sqrt(2).\n   * The optimal line segment will be perpendicular to both lines and have a length equal to this distance.\n   * The midpoint of the segment will lie on the line y = x + \u03b5/2.\n\n7. **Considering the Given Points:** The points (1,1) to (5,5) and (3,3) to (-2,-2) define the same line. Therefore, any line segment on that line will have a maximum distance of 0 from both lines.\n\n**Solution (Assuming Identical Lines)**\n\nGiven the coordinates provided, the lines are identical. Therefore, *any* line segment drawn connecting points on these lines will have a maximum distance of 0 from both lines.  A simple solution is a line segment from (1,1) to (5,5).\n\n**Solution (Assuming Parallel Lines with a small offset \u03b5)**\n\nThe optimal line segment is perpendicular to both lines and has a length of \u03b5 / sqrt(2). The exact coordinates of the endpoints depend on the value of \u03b5 and where you choose to center the segment.\n\n\n\n**Important Note:** The problem statement is slightly ambiguous because the given coordinates define the same line. If the lines were truly parallel (even slightly), the solution would involve finding the perpendicular distance between them and constructing a segment of that length.

Here's how I, as Queen Catherine, would attempt to bridge those values and find compatible pairings, understanding the nuances of governance:\n\n* **Freedom (Party A) <-> Order (Party B):** This pairing is crucial. True freedom *requires* a framework of order to exist. Unfettered chaos is not freedom, it's anarchy.

While absolute equality might be a noble ideal, a focus on *equal application of the law* (a facet of justice) contributes to security.

To maintain such a deception would require the complicity of an impossibly large number of people, and it is highly improbable that such a conspiracy could have remained secret for over fifty years.\n\nFurthermore, independent verification of the moon landing has come from numerous sources, including tracking stations in countries around the world, radio signals received by amateur astronomers, and lunar samples brought back by the astronauts.

Then, we need to calculate the sum of those odd numbers.\n\n**Steps to Solve**\n\n1. **Determine the Starting Odd Number:**  If A is odd, it's our starting point. If A is even, we need to increment it by 1 to get the first odd number in the range.\n\n2. **Determine the Ending Odd Number:** If B is odd, it's our ending point. If B is even, we need to decrement it by 1 to get the last odd number in the range.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum:**  We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n\n   Sum = (n/2) * (first_odd + last_odd)\n\n   where 'n' is the number of odd numbers in the series.\n\n   To find 'n', we can use the formula:\n\n   n = ((last_odd - first_odd) / 2) + 1\n\n**Applying to the Example (A = 15, B = 30)**\n\n1. **Starting Odd Number:** A (15) is already odd, so the starting odd number is 15.\n\n2. **Ending Odd Number:** B (30) is even, so we decrement it by 1 to get the last odd number: 29.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Odd Numbers (n):**\n\n   n = ((29 - 15) / 2) + 1\n   n = (14 / 2) + 1\n   n = 7 + 1\n   n = 8\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum:**\n\n   Sum = (8/2) * (15 + 29)\n   Sum = 4 * 44\n   Sum = 176\n\n**Therefore, the sum of all odd numbers between 15 and 30 (inclusive) is 176.**", "```python\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    boys = list(input().split())\n    girls = list(input().split())\n    \n    if n > m:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return", "Yes", "Based on the sentence \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night,\" the most fitting word from the candidates ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting'] is **'appointment'**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **\"Turned up\"** implies an arrival, often unexpected.\n* **\"Unannounced\"** directly relates to not having a pre-arranged plan.\n* An **appointment** is a pre-arranged meeting, and the sentence explicitly states the visit was *unannounced*, making it ironic and highlighting the surprise. The contrast creates a natural and understandable sentence.\n\nLet's look at why the other options are less suitable:\n\n* **Solicitation:** This refers to asking for something (money, support, etc.) and doesn't fit the context of simply *arriving* at a door.\n* **Meeting:** While a meeting *could* happen at a door, it doesn't inherently convey the unexpected nature emphasized by \"unannounced\" as strongly as the irony of an unannounced *appointment* does.\n\n\n\nTherefore, the index of the correct word is **0** (as 'appointment' is the first word in the list).", "2, 1, 3, 5, 4", "(As Queen Catherine, I would assess this with a regal, yet slightly disgusted, air.)\n\nHmm.

The keyword \"calendar\" establishes that connection.\n\n**Answer: Yes**", "(Queen Catherine adjusts her posture, a slight frown creasing her brow as she considers the problem. She approaches it with the same analytical mind she applies to matters of state.)\n\nThis is a matter of logical deduction, not complex calculation. The passage states the registers open sequentially as the previous one becomes available. A fourth customer arriving at 8:30 am requires understanding the timing of the first three.\n\nThe first register opens at 8:00 am. The second opens as soon as the first is free, and the third as soon as the second is free. This implies a staggered opening. We are told all three are *in use* at 8:30 am. Therefore, each register has a customer.\n\nThe question asks when the *fourth* customer can begin. Since all three are occupied, the fourth must wait until one becomes available. The passage doesn't state how long each customer takes, only that each register serves one at a time. We must assume a consistent service time to answer.\n\nWithout knowing the service time, we can only infer. The answer choices suggest intervals of 5, 15, 30, and 45 minutes. The most logical assumption, given the phrasing, is that the registers operate at a consistent pace. Therefore, the fourth customer will be served once one of the first three is finished.\n\nThe most reasonable answer, given the limited information, is **A) 8:35 am**. This assumes a relatively quick service time, allowing a register to become free within five minutes of the fourth customer's arrival. The other options suggest significantly longer service times, which are not supported by the passage.\n\nIt is a simple problem, but one that requires careful attention to detail.

Sets are used because they only store unique elements and provide fast membership checking (checking if an element is already in the set).\n   - Initializes an empty list called `result`. This will store the unique strings in their original order.\n   - Iterates through the input `string_list` using a `for` loop.\n   - **`if item not in seen:`:**  For each `item` in the list, it checks if the item is already present in the `seen` set.\n     - If the item is *not* in `seen` (meaning it's the first time we've encountered it):\n       - `seen.add(item)`:  The item is added to the `seen` set to mark it as encountered.\n       - `result.append(item)`: The item is appended to the `result` list.\n   - Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the unique strings in their original order.\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - `my_list = ['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']`: Creates a sample list of strings.\n   - `unique_list = remove_duplicates(my_list)`: Calls the `remove_duplicates` function to get a list of unique strings.\n   - `print(unique_list)`: Prints the resulting list, which will be `['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']` in this case because there were no duplicates to begin with.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n- **Sets for fast membership checking:** Using a set (`seen`) to keep track of encountered elements allows for very fast checking of whether an element has already been seen (O(1) on average).  This is much faster than searching through a list (O(n)).\n- **Preserves order:** The code iterates through the original list in order and only appends elements to the `result` list if they haven't been seen before, thus preserving the original order.", "Okay, let's calculate the tax.\n\n1. **Identify the taxable amount:** The tax is applied only to the item cost, which is $100.\n2. **Calculate the tax amount:** Tax rate is 6%, so the tax amount is 6% of $100.
