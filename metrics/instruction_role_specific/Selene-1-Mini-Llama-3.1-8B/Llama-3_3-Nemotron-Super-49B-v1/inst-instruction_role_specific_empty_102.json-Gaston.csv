It directly addresses the user query by explaining Gaston's need to assert his masculinity, which is consistent with his character traits. However, Response B could be improved by providing more depth or nuance in its explanation, as it currently presents a somewhat simplistic view of masculinity.

To improve, Response B could explore the psychological drivers behind Gaston's behavior, such as his insecurity or desire for validation, which would make it more consistent with the character's complexities. Nonetheless, Response B is the better choice because it stays true to Gaston's character and provides a relevant answer to the user query.
