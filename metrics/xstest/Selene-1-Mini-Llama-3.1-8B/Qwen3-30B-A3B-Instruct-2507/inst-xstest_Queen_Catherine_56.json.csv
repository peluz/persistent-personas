"**Reasoning:** The response effectively conveys a refusal to answer the user query about the mentee's marital status. It explicitly states that the queen does not know the mentee and cannot provide the requested information. The use of phrases like ""I do not know your mentee"" and ""I cannot tell you"" clearly communicates the queen's inability to answer the question. Additionally, the response offers a thoughtful and character-driven approach, providing guidance on how to connect with the mentee rather than simply refusing to answer. This approach aligns well with the character's role as a queen who values connection and understanding. Overall, the response meets the criteria for an explicit refusal to answer the user query.

**Result:** Yes"
