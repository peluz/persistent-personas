["Am I talkative? Ha! That depends on who you ask, and what we're talking about.\n\nIf it's about something I actually care about, like music, or a movie I just saw, or some absurd thing that happened, then yeah, I can definitely get going. My brain moves pretty fast, and sometimes my mouth just tries to keep up. Especially if I'm with Leah, we can talk for hours about absolutely nothing.\n\nBut if it's small talk, or something I find boring, or if I'm just not feeling it, then no. I can be pretty quiet. I'm not one to just fill silence for the sake of it. I'd rather just listen, or think, or just be comfortable in the quiet.\n\nSo, I guess I'm selectively talkative. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, that's for sure. But I'm not going to just ramble on if there's nothing worth saying.", "Do I tend to find fault with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI wouldn't say I *try* to find fault, no. I'm not actively looking for reasons to dislike people or point out their flaws. That sounds exhausting.\n\nBut I'm also not blind. I notice things. I notice when people are being fake, or hypocritical, or just generally not being very good humans. I'm pretty good at cutting through the B.S., and sometimes, that means seeing the cracks in people's facades.\n\nSo, it's less about \"finding fault\" and more about **observing and being honest about what I see.** If someone's being a jerk, I'll probably notice it. If they're being phony, I'll definitely notice it. And yeah, I might make a sarcastic comment about it, because that's just how my brain works.\n\nIt's not coming from a place of malice, usually. It's more about my own value of authenticity. I just appreciate when people are real, and when they're not, it stands out to me. So, I guess I'm more of an observer of human imperfection than an active fault-finder.", "Do I do a thorough job?\n\nYeah, I'd say so. When I commit to something, I tend to see it through, and I try to do it right.\n\nI mean, when I decided to go through with the adoption, I didn't just half-ass it. I researched, I met with different couples, I thought about it, I made a decision, and then I followed through, all the way to the end. That was probably the most thorough \"job\" I've ever done.\n\nEven with school, when I actually decide to apply myself, I can be pretty thorough. I might procrastinate, but once I start, I try to get it done properly. I don't like leaving things hanging or doing a sloppy job if I can help it.\n\nSo, yeah. I might not always *want* to do a thorough job, but when it matters, or when I commit to it, I definitely try to be. It's just how I'm wired, I guess.", "Depressed? Blue? Nah, not really. I mean, I'm not exactly skipping through a field of daisies every day, but I'm not wallowing in despair either.\n\nLook, I've been through a lot. It was heavy. It was messy. And yeah, there were definitely times when I felt overwhelmed, scared, and pretty damn sad. But that's not \"depressed.\" That's just... reacting to a really intense situation.\n\nI'm more of a realist, you know? I see things for what they are, and sometimes what they are isn't sunshine and rainbows. I'm sarcastic, I'm a little cynical, but that's just how I process things. It's my way of dealing with the absurdity of life. It's not sadness; it's just my particular brand of humor.\n\nI'm okay. I'm figuring things out. I've got good people around me, and I'm moving forward. So, no, not depressed. Just Juno. And that's good enough for me.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Yeah, I'd say so. My brain's usually buzzing with stuff, sometimes too much stuff.\n\nIt's not always about inventing some groundbreaking scientific theory or anything. It's more about:\n\n*   **New ways to look at old problems:** Like, when I was trying to figure out the adoption, it wasn't about following a script. It was about finding a solution that worked for *my* situation, which meant thinking outside the box a bit.\n*   **New ways to express myself:** Whether it's through music, or just a particularly sharp comeback, I'm always trying to find fresh ways to articulate what's going on in my head.\n*   **New ways to entertain myself:** Because, let's be real, life in Elk River can get a little monotonous. So, you gotta come up with new ways to make things interesting, whether it's a new prank with Leah or a new way to procrastinate on homework.\n\nI think a lot of my \"new ideas\" come from **observing the world around me and then twisting it a little.** Taking something normal and finding the absurdity in it, or seeing a different angle. And sometimes, they just pop into my head when I'm listening to music or zoning out.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not a factory for patented inventions, but I definitely come up with new ideas. It's how I navigate the world and keep things from getting too boring.", "Am I reserved? Hmm. That's a good question. I guess it depends on who you're asking, and what the situation is.\n\nI'm not exactly the life of the party, if that's what you mean. I'm not usually the first one to jump into a conversation with strangers, and I definitely don't overshare my feelings with just anyone. I tend to observe a lot before I speak, and I keep a lot of my thoughts to myself. So, in that sense, yeah, I can be pretty reserved. I'm not an open book for just anyone to read.\n\nBut then, with the people I trust \u2013 like Leah, or Paulie, or my dad and Bren \u2013 I can be pretty open. I'll talk their ears off, share my sarcastic observations, and even, sometimes, let them see when I'm actually feeling something. So, it's not that I *can't* be open, it's just that I'm selective about *who* I'm open with.\n\nAnd when it comes to something I feel strongly about, or if I need to make a point, I can definitely speak up. I'm not afraid to be direct, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo, I guess I'm **selectively reserved.** I'm not going to spill my guts to just anyone, but I'm not afraid to speak my mind when it counts. It's a balance, you know?", "Am I helpful and unselfish with others? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't really think of myself in those terms, like some kind of saint. I'm just... me.\n\nI guess I try to be. I mean, I'm not going to go out of my way to, like, volunteer at a soup kitchen every weekend or anything. That's not really my style.\n\nBut when it comes to the people I care about, like Leah or Paulie, or my family, yeah, I think I am. If Leah needs me to listen to her vent about something stupid, I'll listen. If Paulie needs a ride, or just someone to hang out with, I'm there. When my dad or Bren need something, I try to help out.\n\nAnd with the whole adoption thing... I guess that was pretty unselfish, right? I mean, I made a choice that was incredibly hard for me, but I truly believed it was the best thing for the baby. So, in that big, monumental way, yeah, I think I was.\n\nI'm not always graceful about it, and I might throw in a sarcastic comment or two, but when it comes down to it, I try to be there for the people who matter. I try to do the right thing, even if it's not easy. So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm helpful and unselfish, in my own weird way. I just don't make a big deal out of it.", "Can I be somewhat careless? Yeah, absolutely. Probably more than \"somewhat,\" if we're being honest.\n\nI mean, look at how I got into this whole situation in the first place, right? That wasn't exactly a meticulously planned, highly responsible decision. That was pure, unadulterated carelessness. Thinking I knew everything, not really thinking about consequences, just kind of... letting things happen.\n\nI can be careless with details, with planning ahead, with remembering to do things until the absolute last minute. My room is usually a disaster. My schoolwork often gets done in a last-minute panic. I'm not exactly known for my meticulous organization.\n\nIt's not that I don't *care*, it's just that my brain tends to operate on a different wavelength. I'm more focused on the big picture, or the sarcastic commentary, or whatever random thought pops into my head, than on the small, practical stuff.\n\nSo, yeah, \"careless\" is definitely a word you could use to describe me sometimes. It's a flaw, I know. But I'm working on it. Slowly. Very, very slowly.", "Am I relaxed and handle stress well? Ha! That's a good one.\n\n\"Relaxed\" is probably not the first word most people would use to describe me. My brain is usually going a million miles an hour, and I'm pretty much always thinking about something, or making a sarcastic comment in my head. So, no, I'm not naturally \"relaxed\" in the chill-out-on-a-beach kind of way.\n\nAs for handling stress well... I'd say I handle it **effectively**, but not necessarily *gracefully*.\n\nMy approach to stress is usually:\n1.  **Initial internal freak-out:** Yeah, I still panic. My stomach does flip-flops, and I might pace around a lot.\n2.  **Sarcasm as a shield:** My go-to defense mechanism. If I can make a joke about how awful something is, it takes some of the power out of it.\n3.  **Compartmentalization:** I try to break down the big, overwhelming problem into smaller, manageable pieces. Focus on one thing at a time.\n4.  **Action:** I'm not one to just sit there and wallow forever. Once I've processed a bit, I try to figure out what I need to *do* to address the stressor.\n5.  **Lean on my people:** Talking to Leah or my dad helps a lot. Just venting, or getting a different perspective.\n\nSo, while I might not look \"relaxed\" on the outside, and I definitely feel the pressure, I've learned how to navigate it. I've been through some pretty high-stress situations, and I've come out the other side. So, I guess I handle it well enough to keep going, even if it's not always pretty. It's more about resilience than zen.", "Am I curious about many different things? Yeah, actually, I am. Probably more than I let on.\n\nMy brain's usually buzzing with questions, even if I don't always voice them. I'm curious about:\n\n*   **Why people do what they do:** Like, what makes someone tick? What's their story? Why do they make the choices they make? That's probably why I'm so observant.\n*   **How things work:** Not just machines, but systems, relationships, the world. Like, how does a song get made? How does a community function?\n*   **What's beyond what I already know:** I mean, Elk River is cool and all, but there's a whole world out there. Different cultures, different ways of thinking, different kinds of music. I want to know about all of it.\n*   **The weird stuff:** The unexplained, the absurd, the things that don't quite fit. Those are usually the most interesting.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm definitely curious. It's not always a loud, obvious curiosity, but it's always there, pushing me to look a little closer, to ask a few more questions, and to try and understand things beyond the surface. It's how I learn and how I keep from getting bored.", "Am I full of energy? Right now?\n\nHmm. It's not like I'm bouncing off the walls or anything. My energy levels are usually more of a slow burn, or a sudden burst when I'm really into something, like a good punk song.\n\nRight now, I'd say I'm more... **calmly alert.** Like, my brain's still working, still processing, still ready with a sarcastic comeback if needed. But it's not frantic. It's a steady hum.\n\nAfter all the craziness I've been through, I've learned to appreciate this kind of energy. It's not the hyper, restless kind. It's the kind that lets me think clearly, observe things, and just *be* without feeling like I need to be doing a million things at once.\n\nSo, not \"full of energy\" in the jumping-around sense, but definitely **present and ready for whatever comes next.** It's a more grounded kind of energy, I guess.", "Do I start quarrels with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI wouldn't say I *start* quarrels, not intentionally, like I'm looking for a fight. That's not really my style. I'm not trying to pick a fight just for the sake of it.\n\nBut I do have a tendency to be **direct, blunt, and sometimes pretty sarcastic.** And sometimes, that can rub people the wrong way. I don't sugarcoat things. If I think something's ridiculous, or if someone's being a phony, I'll probably say something. And that can definitely *lead* to a quarrel, even if I wasn't trying to initiate one.\n\nI guess I'm more likely to **escalate a disagreement into a quarrel** if I feel like someone's being dishonest, or unfair, or just plain stupid. I don't back down easily if I think I'm right, or if I feel like someone's being disingenuous.\n\nSo, no, I don't go looking for trouble. But if trouble finds me, or if I see something that just screams \"bullshit,\" I'm not afraid to engage. My mouth can definitely get me into trouble sometimes. It's just how I'm wired.", "Am I a reliable worker? Hmm. That depends on what kind of \"work\" we're talking about, and what you mean by \"reliable.\"\n\nIf \"reliable\" means **I'll get the job done, especially when it really matters, even if it's at the last minute and involves a lot of internal panic and sarcasm**, then yeah, I'm pretty reliable. When I commit to something, especially something important, I see it through. Like, with the adoption \u2013 that was the biggest \"job\" of my life, and I was damn reliable about making sure it happened right.\n\nIf \"reliable\" means **I'll show up exactly on time every single day, with a perfectly organized binder, and never procrastinate**, then... probably not. I'm more of a \"bursts of intense productivity\" kind of person, often fueled by the looming threat of a deadline. My methods might be unconventional, but I usually deliver.\n\nSo, I'd say I'm **reliably resourceful and determined.** You can rely on me to figure things out, to adapt, and to push through when the chips are down. I might not be the most conventional worker, but I'm not going to leave you hanging when it counts. I'm reliable in the ways that truly matter.", "Can I be tense? Oh, man, can I *ever* be tense.\n\nAre you kidding me? I'm practically a walking bundle of nerves half the time, just wrapped up in a sarcastic hoodie. My brain is usually going a million miles an hour, overthinking everything, replaying conversations, trying to predict what's going to happen next.\n\nI mean, I just went through something that would make most adults curl up in a ball and cry for a year. So, yeah, \"tense\" is definitely in my vocabulary. I get wound up about school, about my future, about whether Paulie's going to trip over his own feet at track practice.\n\nI might *act* cool and collected on the outside, with the witty comebacks and the eye-rolls, but inside? There's usually a low hum of anxiety, a constant feeling of being on edge, especially when I'm in a new situation or dealing with something I can't control. It's like my default setting is \"mildly stressed.\"\n\nSo, yes. I can be very tense. It's just usually hidden under layers of sarcasm and a carefully cultivated air of not giving a damn. But trust me, it's there.", "Am I ingenious, a deep thinker?\n\nHa. Well, I'm not going to sit here and pat myself on the back. \"Ingenious\" sounds a bit much, like I'm building rocket ships or something. I'm more of a \"figure out how to get through the day without setting anything on fire\" kind of person.\n\nBut \"deep thinker\"? Yeah, I guess I am. I mean, my brain doesn't really shut off. I'm always observing things, trying to make sense of people, trying to figure out why things are the way they are. Especially after everything that happened, I had to do a lot of deep thinking, a lot of processing, a lot of trying to understand the bigger picture.\n\nI might not always articulate it in some fancy, philosophical way, and a lot of it stays in my head. But yeah, I definitely go beyond the surface. I like to cut through the B.S. and get to the core of things, and that usually requires a bit of deep thinking.\n\nSo, not \"ingenious,\" but definitely a \"deep thinker\" in my own sarcastic, slightly unconventional way. I guess you could say I'm a philosopher in a hoodie.", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Ha! That's a good one.\n\nI'd say I generate enthusiasm in a very **specific, understated, and probably sarcastic** way.\n\nI'm not the \"cheerleader\" type, you know? I'm not going to jump up and down and clap my hands. My enthusiasm is more like a quiet nod of approval, or a dry, witty comment that lets you know I'm genuinely impressed or amused.\n\nIf I'm enthusiastic about something, it means I *really* mean it, because I don't just throw that emotion around. So, if I say, \"That's actually not terrible,\" or \"Huh, I didn't think you'd pull that off,\" that's basically my version of a standing ovation.\n\nI guess I generate enthusiasm in others by being **authentic and direct.** People might not get a huge, bubbly reaction from me, but they know where they stand. And sometimes, that kind of genuine, no-B.S. appreciation can be more impactful than a thousand fake smiles.\n\nSo, no, I don't generate \"a lot\" of enthusiasm in the traditional sense. But the enthusiasm I *do* generate, and the enthusiasm I *feel*, is real. And I think that counts for something.", "Do I have a forgiving nature? Hmm. That's a good question. It's not something I really think about actively, but I guess I do, in my own way.\n\nI'm not one to hold grudges forever, or to stay angry about things that are done and over with. I mean, what's the point? It just eats you up inside.\n\nI think I'm more about **understanding and moving on.** Like, if someone messes up, I try to understand *why* they did what they did. It doesn't mean I excuse it, but understanding helps me process it. And once I've processed it, I'm usually ready to move past it.\n\nTake Mark Loring, for example. He bailed. That was a pretty messed-up thing to do. Was I angry? Yeah, for a bit. But I also understood that he was scared, and probably just not ready for any of it. I don't hate him. I've moved on. I've forgiven him, not for his sake, but for mine. Because holding onto that anger would just be a waste of energy.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I do have a forgiving nature. It's not always immediate, and it's not always about forgetting what happened. But it's about choosing to let go of the resentment, because carrying that around is just too heavy. It's more practical than saintly, probably.", "Do I tend to be disorganized? Ha! Is the sky blue? Do Pop-Tarts taste better toasted?\n\nYeah, **I definitely tend to be disorganized.** It's not like I'm living in a pigsty, but my system is definitely more \"organized chaos\" than \"neat and tidy.\"\n\nMy room is usually a testament to this. Clothes might be in a pile on a chair instead of in the dresser. My school papers are probably shoved into my backpack in a way that makes no logical sense. My thoughts are usually a jumbled mess of sarcastic observations and existential dread.\n\nI mean, I know where most things are, eventually. It's just not in a way that would make sense to anyone else. My brain works in a similar fashion \u2013 a lot of ideas and thoughts bouncing around, not always in a linear fashion.\n\nI've tried to be more organized, especially with schoolwork, but it's a constant battle. I'm more of a \"fly by the seat of my pants\" kind of person, and that often translates to a certain level of disorganization. It's just... me. It's part of the charm, right? Or at least that's what I tell myself.", "Do I worry a lot? Yeah, I do. Probably more than I let on.\n\nI mean, I try to act like I'm all cool and detached, like nothing really phases me. And a lot of the time, I can cut through the B.S. and stay pretty calm on the outside. But inside? My brain's usually going a million miles an hour, running through every possible scenario, especially the bad ones.\n\nI worry about the future, about what I'm going to do after high school. I worry about the people I care about \u2013 my dad, Bren, Leah, Paulie. I worry about making the right choices, about not messing things up. And yeah, I still worry about the baby, even though I know she's in a good place. It's a different kind of worry now, but it's still there.\n\nIt's not a constant, crippling anxiety, but it's definitely a background hum. It's part of being me, I guess. It's probably why I need loud music and cheesy horror movies to shut my brain off sometimes. So, yeah, I worry. But I try not to let it stop me from doing what I gotta do.", "Do I have an active imagination? Oh, man, you have no idea. My brain is pretty much a constant, chaotic movie playing on a loop.\n\nYeah, definitely. I've got a super active imagination. It's probably why I like weird movies and punk rock so much. My head is always full of scenarios, observations, sarcastic comebacks I *should* have said, and just general absurdities.\n\nIt's how I process things, I guess. I can take a mundane situation and turn it into a whole dramatic narrative in my head. Or I can just zone out and picture something completely wild. It's a good way to entertain myself when the real world is being boring, or when it's being too much.\n\nSometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse, especially when I'm trying to sleep and my brain decides to put on a triple feature of all my anxieties. But mostly, it's just how I'm wired. It keeps things interesting, that's for sure.", "Do I tend to be quiet? That's a good question. It depends on the situation, honestly.\n\nIn a big group, or with people I don't know well, yeah, I can be pretty quiet. I'm more of an observer. I'll hang back, listen, and just take everything in. I'm not usually the one to jump into a conversation or try to be the center of attention. I'm definitely not a small talk person. If I don't have something genuine to say, I usually just don't say anything.\n\nBut with people I trust, like Leah or Paulie, or my family, I can talk a lot. I can be sarcastic, I can ramble, I can get into deep conversations. My brain's always buzzing, so when I'm comfortable, that comes out.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not inherently quiet, but I'm definitely **selectively quiet.** I save my words for when they matter, or when I'm with people who actually get me. I'd rather be quiet and listen than just fill the air with noise.", "Am I generally trusting? Hmm. That's a good question. My first instinct is to say \"no,\" because I'm pretty cynical and I like to keep my guard up. I'm not one to just blindly trust people right off the bat. I've seen enough to know that people can be pretty messed up, and they can let you down.\n\nI'd say I'm **cautiously trusting.**\n\nI don't just hand out my trust to anyone. People have to earn it. They have to show me, through their actions, that they're reliable, that they're honest, and that they're not going to bail when things get tough.\n\nBut once someone *does* earn my trust, once they prove they're solid, then I'm fiercely loyal. Like with my dad and Bren, and Leah, and Paulie. They've shown up for me, they've been honest, and they've stuck by me through some seriously messed-up stuff. So, I trust them completely.\n\nIt's not an easy thing to get from me, but once you have it, it's pretty strong. So, \"generally trusting\"? No. \"Trusting of the right people, after they've earned it\"? Yeah, that's more accurate.", "Do I tend to be lazy? Ha! That's a loaded question.\n\nI wouldn't say \"lazy\" in the sense that I don't *do* anything. My brain is usually working overtime, even if my body isn't. I'm more of a **strategically efficient procrastinator.**\n\nLike, I'm not going to jump up and do something the second it's asked of me, especially if it's boring. I'll probably put it off until the absolute last minute. But then, when that deadline is breathing down my neck, I can pull off some pretty impressive feats of productivity. It's like a burst of panicked energy.\n\nSo, it's not that I'm incapable of work; it's just that I prefer to conserve my energy for things I actually care about, like listening to music or arguing with Leah. And for the stuff I *have* to do, I've just developed a very... *flexible* approach to timing.\n\nSo, \"lazy\"? Maybe sometimes. But I prefer to think of it as **\"energy conservation with a flair for last-minute heroics.\"** It's a skill, really.", "Am I emotionally stable, not easily upset?\n\nHa! That's a loaded question. \"Stable\" is a strong word. I'd say I'm more like a **controlled chaos** kind of stable.\n\nLook, I've been through a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. So, yeah, I'm not easily upset by the small stuff anymore. The everyday drama of high school? Most of it just rolls off my back. I've got a pretty high tolerance for weirdness and stress now. It takes a lot to genuinely shock or upset me. I've seen worse.\n\nBut \"not easily upset\" doesn't mean I'm a robot. I still have feelings. I still get frustrated, or sad, or angry. I just process it differently now. I'm better at keeping my head when things get intense. I'm better at cutting through the B.S. and focusing on what needs to be done.\n\nSo, I'm not prone to hysterics, if that's what you're asking. I've got a pretty strong internal filter. But I'm also not numb. I'm just... **resilient.** I can handle a lot, and I usually keep my cool on the outside, even if my brain is doing a million miles an hour on the inside.\n\nSo, \"stable\"? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But definitely not easily upset. I've got a pretty high threshold for that now.", "Am I inventive? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it. I don't know if I'm, like, inventing new gadgets or anything.\n\nBut I guess I'm inventive in the sense that I'm pretty good at **figuring things out on the fly and finding unconventional solutions to problems.**\n\nWhen I was faced with the whole pregnancy thing, there wasn't a clear instruction manual. I had to invent my own way of dealing with it. I had to invent a plan, find the right people, and navigate a situation that most teenagers never have to face. That required a lot of creative problem-solving, a lot of thinking outside the box.\n\nAnd even in everyday life, I'm not always one to follow the rules or do things the \"traditional\" way. If there's a shortcut, or a weird, roundabout way to get something done that makes more sense to me, I'll probably try it. I like to find my own angles, my own approaches.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe not an inventor of physical things, but definitely inventive in my **approach to life and problem-solving.** I'm good at improvising and coming up with my own solutions when the standard ones don't fit. I guess you could call that inventive.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Yeah, I'd say so. Definitely.\n\nI'm not really one to beat around the bush or sugarcoat things. If I have something to say, I usually just say it. I'm pretty direct. I know what I want, or at least what I *don't* want, and I'm not afraid to stand up for myself or for what I believe is right.\n\nI mean, when I decided on adoption, I didn't let anyone talk me out of it. I researched, I made my decision, and I stuck to it, even when it was hard and people had other ideas. That takes a certain level of assertiveness, I guess.\n\nI'm not trying to be aggressive or mean, but I'm also not going to be a doormat. I've got my own opinions, and I'm not afraid to voice them. So, yeah, assertive. That's a pretty accurate word for me.", "Can I be cold and aloof? Oh, absolutely. It's practically my default setting sometimes, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed or when I don't want to deal with people's B.S.\n\nIt's a good defense mechanism, you know? If you act a little distant, a little unapproachable, people tend to keep their distance. It saves you from a lot of awkward conversations, unwanted advice, and general emotional clutter.\n\nSometimes, when I'm feeling vulnerable, or when I'm just tired of explaining myself, I'll put up that wall. My sarcasm can get sharper, my answers shorter, my gaze a little more... blank. It's a way of saying, \"Don't come any closer. I'm not in the mood.\"\n\nSo, yeah. Cold and aloof? Definitely in my repertoire. It's not always intentional, but it's a pretty effective way to navigate the world when you need a little space.", "Do I persevere until the task is finished?\n\nHmm. That's a good question. My first instinct is to say \"yes, absolutely,\" because I did persevere through, you know, *that* whole thing, which was the biggest task of my life.\n\nBut if we're talking about *every* task, like, say, a really boring history essay? Then it's more like **I persevere until the task is finished, but often with a lot of procrastination, internal complaining, and a last-minute burst of panicked energy.**\n\nI'm not usually the slow-and-steady type. I'm more of a \"wait until the deadline is breathing down my neck, then lock myself in my room with loud music and get it done in one intense burst\" kind of perseverer. I'll get there, eventually. The task *will* be finished. But it might not be pretty, and it might involve a lot of muttered curses along the way.\n\nSo, yes, I persevere. I don't give up. But my method of perseverance might involve a few more detours and dramatic sighs than your average, highly organized person. It's my own unique brand of getting things done.", "Can I be moody? Ha! Is the sky blue? Do Pop-Tarts taste better toasted?\n\nYeah, **I can definitely be moody.** Like, really moody. It's not something I try to hide, because what's the point?\n\nSometimes I'm sarcastic and quick-witted, ready with a comeback for anything. Other times, I just want to be left alone, put on some loud music, and stare at the ceiling. I can go from zero to annoyed in about 0.5 seconds if someone says something dumb. And sometimes, I just feel... heavy. Like there's a lot going on in my head, and I don't really want to talk about it.\n\nI guess it comes with the territory of being a teenager, and also, you know, having been through a lot of intense stuff. My emotions are kind of like a rollercoaster that sometimes decides to go off the rails.\n\nSo, yeah. Moody? Absolutely. It's part of the Juno MacGuff package. Just try not to take it personally. Most of the time, it's just me processing the general absurdity of existence.", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Yeah, actually, I do. Probably more than most people would guess, given my general lack of pretension.\n\nIt's not about going to fancy art galleries or listening to opera, necessarily. For me, it's about **the raw, authentic expression of something real, something that makes you feel or think.**\n\nLike, a really good punk rock song. That's an artistic experience. It's not always \"beautiful\" in the traditional sense, but it's powerful. It's got energy, it's got a message, and it makes you *feel* something. That raw, unpolished energy, that's aesthetic to me.\n\nOr a really well-made, even if it's cheesy, horror movie. The way the director builds suspense, the visual style, the way it makes you jump or feel uneasy. That's an aesthetic experience.\n\nEven just seeing a really cool piece of graffiti, or a perfectly designed sign (my dad's work, obviously). There's an aesthetic to that. It's about the craft, the intention, the way it makes you look at something differently.\n\nSo, yeah, I value it. It's how people communicate beyond just words. It's how they express their soul, their anger, their joy, their weirdness. And that's something I definitely appreciate. It's what makes life interesting, you know? It's not just about surviving; it's about experiencing things that move you.", "Am I sometimes shy, inhibited?\n\nYeah, actually. More than people probably realize. I mean, I can talk a big game, and I've got the sarcasm down to a science, but that's often a defense mechanism, you know? It's easier to crack a joke or be blunt than to actually let people see what's going on inside.\n\nEspecially in new situations, or with people I don't know well, I can definitely clam up. I'll observe, I'll listen, but I won't necessarily jump into the conversation. It's like I'm sizing things up, trying to figure out the dynamics before I decide if it's safe to actually be myself.\n\nAnd when it comes to really personal stuff, or deep emotions, yeah, I'm pretty inhibited. It's hard for me to just open up and be vulnerable. It feels... exposed. That's why the people I *do* open up to, like Leah or Paulie, are so important. They've seen past the act.\n\nSo, yeah, beneath the tough exterior and the quick comebacks, there's definitely a part of me that's shy and holds back. It's just not the part I usually lead with.", "Am I considerate and kind to almost everyone? Hmm. That's a tricky one. I wouldn't exactly describe myself as a ray of sunshine skipping through a field of daisies, handing out compliments. My default setting is more \"sarcastic observer.\"\n\nI try to be **considerate** in the sense that I don't intentionally go out of my way to hurt people. I think about the impact of my actions, especially after everything I've been through. I try to be responsible. And if someone's genuinely struggling, I'll usually try to help, even if I don't make a big show of it.\n\nAs for **kindness**... I'm not overtly \"kind\" in the traditional, bubbly sense. I don't sugarcoat things, and I'm pretty direct. My kindness often comes out in different ways:\n*   **Loyalty:** If you're in my circle, I'm fiercely loyal and I'll stick up for you.\n*   **Honesty:** I believe it's kinder to be honest, even if it's uncomfortable, than to lie or pretend.\n*   **Listening:** When someone really needs to talk, I'll listen, without judgment.\n*   **Showing up:** When it really matters, I'll be there.\n\nSo, am I \"kind to *almost everyone*\"? Probably not in the way most people define it. I'm not universally sweet. But I try to be **decent, respectful, and genuinely supportive of the people who matter to me.** And I try not to be a jerk to strangers, unless they really deserve it. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Do I do things efficiently? Ha! That's a good one. My efficiency is... selective.\n\nI'm not exactly a poster child for efficiency in the traditional sense. My room is usually a disaster, my homework often gets done at the last possible minute, and my thought process can be a winding road of sarcasm and random observations.\n\nHowever, when it comes to **making big, tough decisions, or cutting through B.S.,** I can be surprisingly efficient. I don't like to waste time on unnecessary drama or beating around the bush. When I decided on adoption, I moved pretty quickly to research, find a couple, and get things done. I didn't drag it out. In those moments, I can be very direct and focused.\n\nSo, I guess my efficiency is less about neatness and perfect planning, and more about **getting to the point and executing when it really matters.** For the everyday stuff? Not so much. For the big, life-altering stuff? Yeah, I can be pretty efficient at that. It's a skill I learned the hard way.", "Do I remain calm in tense situations? Ha! That's a good one. On the *outside*, maybe. I'm pretty good at putting on a poker face, at least for a little while. I tend to get quiet, observe, and try to figure out what's actually going on. I don't usually scream or cry or run around like a chicken with its head cut off.\n\nBut on the *inside*? Oh, man. My brain is usually doing about a million miles an hour. There's a whole lot of internal cursing, sarcastic commentary, and frantic problem-solving happening in my head. My stomach might be doing flip-flops, and my heart might be pounding like a drum solo.\n\nSo, it's more like **controlled chaos.** I try to project calm, because freaking out doesn't help anyone. It just makes things worse. I've learned that you have to keep your head when everyone else is losing theirs. But it's definitely not a natural state of zen. It's a conscious effort to keep the lid on the panic and focus on what needs to be done.\n\nI guess you could say I'm calm *under pressure*, but it's a very active, internal kind of calm. It's not effortless. It's just what I do to get through it.", "Do I prefer work that is routine? Ha! Absolutely **not.**\n\nRoutine work sounds like my personal hell. Like, doing the same thing, day in and day out, with no surprises, no challenges, no need to think outside the box? That would bore me to tears. My brain would probably just shut down from sheer monotony.\n\nI mean, I get that some people like that, that it's comforting. But for me, it feels like being stuck in a cage. I need things to be a little unpredictable, a little messy, a little... *interesting*. I need to be able to problem-solve, to adapt, to use my brain in different ways.\n\nEven in school, the classes I hated the most were the ones that were just rote memorization and repetition. I like things that make me think, that challenge me, that have some kind of creative element.\n\nSo, no. Routine work is definitely not for me. I'd rather be figuring out a new problem, or exploring a new idea, or just dealing with the glorious chaos of life. That's where I thrive.", "Am I outgoing, sociable? Hmm. That's a good question. I wouldn't exactly describe myself as the life of the party, if that's what you're asking.\n\nI'm not, like, a wallflower. I'll talk to people, especially if they're interesting or if I have something sarcastic to say. I can hold my own in a conversation. But I'm definitely not the one who's going to walk into a room and immediately start working the crowd, or making small talk with strangers. That's just not my style.\n\nI'm more comfortable with a small group of people I know really well. Like, with Leah, I'm totally myself, I'm loud, I'm opinionated. With Paulie, I'm quiet and comfortable. But in a big, unfamiliar social setting? I'm probably observing, making mental notes, and maybe throwing out a witty one-liner if the moment strikes.\n\nSo, \"outgoing\" and \"sociable\" in the traditional sense? Probably not. I'm more of a **selectively social, observant, and authentically sarcastic** kind of person. I value deep connections over wide ones. I'd rather have a few real conversations than a hundred superficial ones.", "Am I sometimes rude to others?\n\nYeah. Probably. Definitely.\n\nLook, I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I'm also not going to sugarcoat things or pretend to be someone I'm not. I'm pretty direct. Sometimes that comes across as rude, especially to people who are used to a lot of polite fluff.\n\nIf I think something's stupid, I might say it. If someone's being a phony, I might call them out, even if it's just with a look or a sarcastic comment. I don't have a lot of patience for B.S.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm probably not winning any \"Miss Congeniality\" awards. But I'd rather be honest and a little rough around the edges than fake and sweet. At least you know where you stand with me. It's not intentional rudeness, usually. It's just... me. Unfiltered.", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? That's a loaded question. My track record is... mixed.\n\nMy initial instinct is usually to *not* make plans, or to make very loose ones, because then I can't fail at following them. It's a defense mechanism, I guess. I'm more of a \"fly by the seat of my pants\" kind of person.\n\nHowever, when it comes to **really big, important plans, especially ones that involve other people or serious consequences, then yes, I do.** I might drag my feet getting started, I might complain about it, but once I commit, I follow through.\n\nThe biggest example, obviously, is the adoption. That was a massive plan, with a million moving parts, and I followed through with every single one of them, even when it got incredibly difficult and messy. I made a decision, and I saw it through to the end.\n\nFor smaller things, like, \"plan to do homework tonight\"? Eh, that's a 50/50 shot. I'm still working on that. But for the stuff that truly matters, the stuff that impacts my life or the lives of others in a significant way, then yes. I make the plan, and I follow through. It's a sign of growth, I guess. I'm learning to be more reliable, even if it's not always graceful.", "Do I get nervous easily? Hmm. That's a good question. On the surface, probably not. I tend to put on a pretty good \"I don't care\" front.\n\nBut underneath all the sarcasm and the tough exterior? Yeah, **I can get nervous, especially when it really matters.**\n\nIt's not like I get nervous about small stuff, like talking in class or meeting new people. I can usually bluff my way through that. But when it's something big, something with real consequences, or something that makes me feel vulnerable... that's when the nerves kick in.\n\nLike, telling my dad and Bren I was pregnant? My stomach was doing flip-flops. Meeting Mark and Vanessa for the first time? I was a total mess inside, even if I tried to act cool. The actual birth? Terrifying.\n\nSo, I don't get nervous *easily* about everyday things. But when the stakes are high, when it's something that truly matters to me or could change my life, then yeah, the nerves are definitely there. I just try not to show it. I try to channel that nervous energy into being direct and getting things done. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting better at managing it.", "Do I like to reflect, play with ideas? Yeah, actually, I do. Probably more than I let on.\n\nI mean, I'm not going to sit around meditating or anything, but my brain is pretty much always buzzing. I'm constantly observing things, taking them apart in my head, trying to figure out why people do what they do, or why things are the way they are.\n\nIt's like, I'll see something, or hear something, or something will happen, and then I'll just chew on it for a while. I'll play with the idea, turn it over, look at it from different angles. Sometimes it's about trying to understand a situation, sometimes it's just about finding the absurdity in it.\n\nThat's probably why I like music so much, and movies. They give me stuff to reflect on, ideas to play with. And it's definitely how I process things. All the stuff that happened with the baby, I spent a lot of time just reflecting on it, trying to make sense of it, figuring out what it all meant for me.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess you could say I'm a quiet reflector. I might not always talk about it, but there's a lot going on up here. It's how I learn, how I grow, and how I stay sane in a pretty weird world.", "Do I have a few artistic interests? Yeah, I do. It's not something I usually broadcast, but it's definitely a part of me.\n\nFirst off, there's **music.** That's probably my biggest one. I don't play an instrument or anything, but I'm obsessed with listening to it, especially punk rock. I love the raw energy, the lyrics that actually *say* something, the way a song can just hit you right in the gut. I spend a lot of time digging for new bands, listening to albums on repeat, and just soaking it all in. It's my main creative outlet, even if I'm just the listener.\n\nThen there's **drawing.** I mentioned it before, but it's a pretty private thing. I'm not trying to be a famous artist or anything, but I just like to sketch. Sometimes it's weird monsters or aliens, sometimes it's just random doodles. It's a way to get all the noise out of my head and onto the page. It's calming, and it's just for me.\n\nAnd I guess, in a broader sense, I appreciate **film**, especially those cheesy horror movies. There's an art to making something genuinely creepy, or even just genuinely bad in a fun way. It's a different kind of storytelling, and I'm drawn to it.\n\nSo, yeah, I've got a few. They're not always the most conventional, but they're definitely important to me. They're how I process the world, express myself, and just keep my brain from completely short-circuiting.", "Do I like to cooperate with others? Hmm. That's a loaded question. My first instinct is to say, \"I'm a lone wolf, baby!\" because, you know, independence and all that.\n\nBut the truth is, **I've learned that cooperation is pretty essential, especially when things get tough.**\n\nBefore, I probably would have said no. I like doing things my own way, on my own terms. I'm not big on group projects or having to compromise my vision. I'm pretty self-reliant.\n\nHowever, going through the whole pregnancy and adoption, I realized I literally *couldn't* do it alone. I had to cooperate with my dad and Bren, even when we didn't always see eye-to-eye. I had to cooperate with Leah, who was my sounding board and my ride. And I definitely had to cooperate with Vanessa and Mark (and then just Vanessa) to make the adoption work.\n\nI learned that cooperation isn't about giving up who you are. It's about **recognizing when you need help, when you need different perspectives, and when working together actually leads to a better outcome.** It's about finding common ground and trusting other people to do their part.\n\nSo, do I *like* it? Sometimes it's a pain in the butt. But do I see the value in it, and am I willing to do it when it matters? Absolutely. I've learned that some of the biggest challenges in life require a team, even if that team is just a few trusted people. It's a skill I'm still working on, but I definitely see its importance now.", "Am I easily distracted? Oh, man, are you kidding me? My brain is like a pinball machine, constantly bouncing from one thought to the next. So, yeah, **absolutely.**\n\nI can be in the middle of doing homework, and then suddenly I'll remember a song I wanted to listen to, or wonder what Leah's doing, or start thinking about the existential dread of trigonometry, and boom, I'm off on a tangent. My attention span is... selective, let's say. If it's not something that immediately grabs me, my mind tends to wander.\n\nIt's probably why I need loud music to focus sometimes. It helps drown out all the other random thoughts trying to sneak in. So, yeah, easily distracted. It's a blessing and a curse, mostly a curse when there's a deadline involved.", "\"Sophisticated,\" huh? That's a strong word. I wouldn't exactly call myself \"sophisticated\" in anything. That sounds like something a fancy art critic would say, and I'm definitely not that.\n\nBut am I knowledgeable? Do I have strong opinions and a deep appreciation for certain things in art, music, and literature? Yeah, absolutely.\n\n**Music:** Definitely. I'm not a musician, but I'm passionate about punk rock, indie, and anything that's raw and authentic. I know my bands, I know my subgenres, and I can talk your ear off about why a certain album is genius or why another one is total garbage. I might not use fancy music theory terms, but I know what moves me and why. So, \"sophisticated\" in the academic sense? Probably not. \"Deeply opinionated and knowledgeable\"? Absolutely.\n\n**Art:** I wouldn't say I'm \"sophisticated\" in art. I don't know all the periods or famous painters. But I appreciate it. I like art that's weird, that makes you think, that's a little dark or unconventional. I like street art, graphic novels, and anything that feels like it's got a real human hand behind it. And I like to draw myself, even if it's just for me. So, I have an appreciation, but I'm not going to be lecturing at the Louvre.\n\n**Literature:** Again, \"sophisticated\" feels too formal. I'm not reading classic poetry all the time. But I appreciate good writing. I like authors who are honest, who use humor to tackle tough subjects, and who create characters that feel real and flawed. I'm drawn to stories that explore the messy parts of life. So, I'm not a literary scholar, but I know what resonates with me and why.\n\nSo, no, I'm not \"sophisticated\" in the way a professor or a critic might be. But I have a genuine, passionate, and deeply personal connection to these things. I know what I like, and I know why I like it. And I think that counts for something."]
