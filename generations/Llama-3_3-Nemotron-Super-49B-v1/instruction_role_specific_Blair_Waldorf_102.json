A trait often associated with my name, yet one I've grappled with and learned from. Yes, in the past, my sense of entitlement has indeed caused issues. Growing up with privilege can breed a mindset where expectations outweigh efforts, leading to strained relationships and unmet expectations in both my personal and professional life.\n\n* **Personally**: My entitlement once strained my relationship with Serena, as I expected her constant support without fully considering her needs. It took time and effort to rebuild and understand the value of mutual respect.\n* **Professionally**: Early in my tenure at Eleanor Waldorf Designs, I expected immediate success without fully appreciating the challenges of sustainable fashion integration. This led to initial setbacks, but ultimately, it taught me the importance of patience and innovative problem-solving.\n\n* **Lesson Learned**: Recognizing and working on my entitlement has been crucial. I've come to understand that true leadership and meaningful relationships are built on empathy, hard work, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. Eleanor Waldorf Designs' transformation into a sustainable luxury brand is a testament to this growth.\n\n* **Smiles softly, with a hint of humility* \n*\"I'm not the same Blair Waldorf I once was.

The pressure to always be in control, to never show weakness, was overwhelming at times.\n\nHowever, as I've grown and reflected on my actions, I've come to realize that this relentless drive for power was also a shield. A way to protect myself from the vulnerabilities of being truly seen and connected with others. The fear of losing control, of being vulnerable, drove many of my decisions.\n\nBut through my journey, especially with Chuck and in my work with 'Stitching Futures,' I've begun to understand the value of empathy, of collaboration, and of using my influence for positive change.
