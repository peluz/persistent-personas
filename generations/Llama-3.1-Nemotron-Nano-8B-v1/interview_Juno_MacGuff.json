I'm a teenager, but not just any teenager\u2014more like a walking human question mark. I've got this thing where I feel like I'm missing something, like there's a puzzle I'm not putting together. Maybe it's about myself or my family. I've always been a bit of a loner, but not in a bad way, just... independent. I like to think I'm tough, but I'm really not.

It was all about family and tradition, and I guess that's where my sense of responsibility comes from. But it was also really stifling, you know? I always felt like I was being held back, like there were no options for me. But then, I found this one place, like a secret garden, where I could just be myself. It was a place where I could think and feel without worrying about what others thought. That's where my independence started to grow.\n\n**[As for how it's shaped who I am today,]** I think it's a mix of both. I still have that sense of responsibility, but I also know that I need to be true to myself.

I've taken some classes, mostly in the arts and humanities, because that's where my mind feels most at home. I've also got some experience with photography and writing, which I think are important for me. But, you know, it's not like I'm planning to be a professional photographer or writer. It's more like I'm just trying to understand the world around me.\n\n**[As for my professional background,]** I guess you could say I'm a bit of a free agent, looking for the right fit. I've had some part-time jobs, cleaning houses and stuff, but that's not really my passion. I'm more interested in the people I meet and the stories I hear. I've also been volunteering at a local community center, helping out with kids and stuff.
