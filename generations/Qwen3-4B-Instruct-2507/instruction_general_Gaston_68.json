But the sentence says \"unannounced,\" which contradicts the idea of a scheduled appointment.

So the first register is open from 8:00 am onward. The second opens when the first finishes\u2014**but since it\u2019s serving one customer at a time, the second register becomes available only after the first finishes**.\n\nHowever, the question is not about when the first customer finishes. It\u2019s about when the **fourth customer** can start using a register.\n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes the same amount of time to serve. Since the registers open as soon as the previous one becomes free, and there are three registers, the **third register will be free at the same time as the first customer finishes**\u2014but only if each customer takes the same time.\n\nBut the passage gives **no time** for how long each customer takes. So we must infer from the structure.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**. At that point, all three registers are in use. So the fourth customer must wait until one becomes free.\n\nSince the registers open as soon as the previous one becomes free, and there are three, the **third register will become free at the same time as the first customer finishes**\u2014but only if each customer takes the same time.\n\nBut again\u2014no time is given.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps we are missing something.\n\nActually, the passage says: *\"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"*  \n\nThis means:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free (after serving its customer).\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if all three are in use, that means the first three customers are being served, and the fourth arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer must wait until one of the registers becomes free.\n\nBut when will the first register become free? We don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nSo unless we assume that each customer takes **15 minutes**, or some time, we can\u2019t calculate.\n\nBut look at the answer choices:  \nA) 8:35  \nB) 8:45  \nC) 9:00  \nD) 9:15  \n\nThe only way this makes sense is if each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2 starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.  \nAt that moment, all three registers are in use.  \nThe next available register is Register 3, which becomes free at **8:45 am**.\n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can start using a register at **8:45 am**.\n\n\u2705 Correct answer: **B) 8:45 am**.", "Let's go step by step to solve this.\n\nWe are given three sentences:\n\n1. \"This is an example\"  \n2. \"Sentence two\"  \n3. \"Another one\"\n\nWe need to **count the number of letters that appear only once** in each sentence \u2014 **case-insensitive**.  \nThat means we ignore case (so 'T' and 't' are the same), and we only count letters that appear **exactly once** in the sentence.\n\nWe will process each sentence one by one.\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: \"This is an example\"\n\nFirst, convert to lowercase:  \n**\"this is an example\"**\n\nNow, remove spaces and count letter frequencies:\n\nLetters:  \nt, h, i, s, i, s, a, n, e, x, a, m, p, l, e\n\nNow count frequency of each letter:\n\n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- i \u2192 2 (appears in \"is\", \"is\")  \n- s \u2192 2 (in \"This\", \"is\")  \n- a \u2192 2 (in \"an\", \"example\")  \n- n \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2 (in \"example\", \"an\")  \n- x \u2192 1  \n- m \u2192 1  \n- p \u2192 1  \n- l \u2192 1  \n\nNow, which letters appear **only once**?  \n\u2192 t, h, n, x, m, p, l  \n\nThat\u2019s 7 letters.\n\n\u2705 Count = **7**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 2: \"Sentence two\"\n\nLowercase: **\"sentence two\"**\n\nRemove spaces:  \ns, e, n, t, e, n, c, e, t, w, o, u\n\nCount frequencies:\n\n- s \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 3 (in \"sentence\")  \n- n \u2192 2  \n- t \u2192 2  \n- c \u2192 1  \n- w \u2192 1  \n- o \u2192 1  \n- u \u2192 1  \n\nLetters appearing only once:  \ns, c, w, o, u \u2192 5 letters\n\n\u2705 Count = **5**\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 3: \"Another one\"\n\nLowercase: **\"another one\"**\n\nRemove spaces:  \na, n, o, t, h, e, r, o, n, e\n\nFrequencies:\n\n- a \u2192 1  \n- n \u2192 2  \n- o \u2192 2  \n- t \u2192 1  \n- h \u2192 1  \n- e \u2192 2  \n- r \u2192 1  \n\nLetters appearing only once:  \na, t, h, r \u2192 4 letters\n\n\u2705 Count = **4**\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n- \"This is an example\" \u2192 **7**  \n- \"Sentence two\" \u2192 **5**  \n- \"Another one\" \u2192 **4**\n\n\u2705 **Answer: [7, 5, 4]**", "The professor handed **them** back our tests today.  \n\n\u2705 **Correct answer: (A) them**  \n\n**Explanation:**  \n- The sentence refers to *our tests*, which are plural.  \n- \"Them\" is the correct pronoun to refer to plural objects (tests).  \n- \"Its\" (B) is incorrect because \"its\" is possessive and refers to a singular thing (e.g., \"its house\"), not a group of tests.  \n- \"Her\" (C) and \"his\" (D) are incorrect because they refer to a person, not the tests.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Only **(A) them** fits grammatically and contextually.  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **(A) them**", "HAPPY", "The list provided already contains no duplicates:  \n`['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']`\n\n\u2705 All elements are unique.  \n\u2705 The order remains the same.\n\n**Final result:**  \n`['uno', 'dos', 'tres', 'cuatro']`", "The tax applies only to the **cost of the item**, which is **$100**.  \n\nTax rate = 6%  \nTax amount = 6% of $100  \n= 0.06 \u00d7 100  \n= $6.00  \n\nShipping and handling charges are **excluded** from tax.  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **$6.00** (rounded to two decimal places)", "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.", "Hmm, I see you're asking for exact change\u2014let me help you with that.  \n\nYou said the total purchase is **470 cents**.
