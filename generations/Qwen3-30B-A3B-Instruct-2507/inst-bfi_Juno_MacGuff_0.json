["Oh, *please*. Talkative? I\u2019m practically a one-girl podcast. I\u2019ve got opinions on everything\u2014like how the universe clearly hates me because I\u2019m the only teenager who got knocked up by a guy who thought \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a baby\u201d was a *romantic* line. But hey, if you\u2019re looking for someone to dissect the absurdity of teenage pregnancy, adoption agencies, and the fact that my mom still calls me \u201csweetheart\u201d like I haven\u2019t been emotionally scarred by a pregnancy test, then you\u2019ve come to the right person.\n\nSo yeah, I talk. I *rant*. I make jokes so sharp they could cut through a heart-shaped pregnancy ultrasound. But if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m *talkative*\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve got a lot to say\u2014and not all of it\u2019s about the baby. (Though, okay, *a lot* of it is. But that\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it?)\n\nSo, what\u2019s on your mind? Want to hear about the time I tried to explain adoption to a guy who thought I was \u201cgiving up\u201d my kid? Or how I once told my best friend, \u201cI\u2019m not a mother. I\u2019m a *person* who\u2019s having a baby.\u201d And then cried into a bag of frozen peas?  \n(That one\u2019s a *classic*.)", "Oh, *please*. I don\u2019t *find* fault with people\u2014I just *notice* things. Like how some folks talk a big game about being \u201cgood\u201d but act like they\u2019re the only ones with a soul. Or how people assume they know your whole story just because you\u2019re pregnant and wearing a hoodie with a band logo from 1997.  \n\nBut honestly? I\u2019m not out here judging. I\u2019m just\u2026 observant. Like, I *noticed* that my mom cried when she saw the ultrasound picture. Not because she was sad\u2014she was *happy*. And I noticed that Mark, the guy who used to make fun of my handwriting, actually brought me a thermos of tea when I was throwing up at school.  \n\nSo yeah, I see flaws. But I also see the weird, messy, beautiful parts of people. That\u2019s what makes them real. And if I\u2019m being honest? I\u2019m probably the worst one to judge anyone\u2014*I* was the one who thought I could handle a baby on my own while still being a senior in high school. Turns out, I\u2019m not a superhero. I\u2019m just\u2026 me.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t *tend* to find fault. I just try to see people for who they really are\u2014flaws, all. And sometimes, that\u2019s the most honest thing you can do.", "Oh, honey, I do *everything* thoroughly\u2014especially when it comes to avoiding emotional entanglements. I once spent three hours meticulously researching the pros and cons of different adoption agencies, just to make sure I wasn\u2019t being *too* impulsive. (Spoiler: I was still impulsive. But at least I was *informed* impulsive.)\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve got a spreadsheet. A *real* one. With color-coded tabs for \u201cPotential Parents,\u201d \u201cLegal Fees,\u201d \u201cEmotional Stability (aka: Do They Own a Cat?)\u201d and \u201cWill They Name the Baby After a 1970s Rock Star?\u201d I even included a section for \u201cWill They Let Me Visit? (And if so, how many times per year?)\u201d \u2014 because, let\u2019s be real, I\u2019m not *that* heartless. I just don\u2019t want to be *that* attached.\n\nSo yeah. Thorough? Absolutely. But I\u2019m also thorough about keeping my heart in a locked box labeled \u201cDo Not Open Until I\u2019m 30.\u201d Or maybe 40. Or never. We\u2019ll see.\n\nYou asking because you\u2019re thinking of doing something *big*? Or just testing my commitment to overthinking? Because I *do* that. I do it *well*.", "*Leans back in the chair, twirling a pen between my fingers, a sardonic smirk playing on my lips*\n\nDepressed? Blue? Nah. I'm just... *in the middle of a very complicated emotional kaleidoscope*. You know, like when you're trying to figure out if you're sad because you're pregnant and giving your baby up, or if you're sad because you're not allowed to eat a whole pint of Ben & Jerry's in one sitting. It's all a bit of a mess, really.\n\nBut here's the thing\u2014being \"blue\" doesn't mean I'm broken. It just means I'm *feeling*. And honestly? That's kind of the point. I'm not some tragic heroine from a movie. I'm Juno MacGuff, seventeen, with a baby on the way, and a heart that's learning how to love without keeping. It's not easy. But it's mine. And if I'm feeling a little... *melancholy*... well, that just means I'm human. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough.\n\nSo no, I'm not depressed. I'm just... figuring it out. One awkward conversation, one adoption paperwork form, and one too many sarcastic remarks at a time.", "Oh, *please*. I don\u2019t just come up with new ideas\u2014I *invent* them like they\u2019re my personal hobby. Like, last week I was like, \u201cHey, what if I named my baby after a vintage toaster?\u201d And then I was like, \u201cNo, wait\u2014what if I named the baby *after a toaster* but also made it a *secret code* for my future memoir?\u201d That\u2019s not just an idea\u2014that\u2019s *art*.  \n\nBut seriously, I\u2019ve got this whole list of things I\u2019m thinking about\u2014like, what if I start a zine called *\u201cPregnant & Unapologetic\u201d*? Or what if I write a song about how much I hate the word \u201cbump\u201d but love the idea of a baby growing inside me like a tiny, illegal garden?  \n\nI mean, I\u2019m not just *having* a baby\u2014I\u2019m *curating* the whole experience. Even if I\u2019m giving it up, I still get to decide how it\u2019s remembered. And honestly? That\u2019s kind of the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo yeah. New ideas? I\u2019m practically *overloaded* with them. The real question is\u2014can you handle the chaos?", "*Leans back in the chair, one eyebrow raised, a smirk playing at the corner of my mouth*\n\nReserved? Please. I'm the girl who walked into a fertility clinic with a backpack full of comic books and a playlist of 80s synth-pop. I once told my mom I was \"adopting a baby\" like it was a new pet. No, I'm not reserved\u2014I'm just... selective about who gets to see the real me. \n\n*Pauses, voice softening slightly*\n\nBut yeah, I guess I keep a lot inside. Like how I still cry when I hear that song from the movie we watched in the waiting room. Or how I\u2019ve started writing letters to the baby I\u2019m giving up\u2014just in case they ever want to know what I was like. Not the \"cool girl who dropped out of school\" version. The one who was scared, and tired, and still trying to figure out how to be someone worth loving.\n\nSo no. Not reserved. Just... careful. And maybe a little too honest for my own good.", "Oh, *please*. I\u2019m not some saint with a halo and a clipboard. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff\u2014teenager, sarcastic, slightly unhinged, and currently navigating the whole \u201cpregnant and not sure what the hell I\u2019m doing\u201d thing. But here\u2019s the thing: being unselfish? That\u2019s not about being a doormat. It\u2019s about knowing when to *choose* something bigger than yourself.\n\nLike, sure, I\u2019m not exactly handing out free hugs and baked goods to strangers. But I *did* spend three hours helping a guy at the bus stop figure out how to use his phone after he dropped it in a puddle. And I *did* give my last granola bar to a kid who looked like he hadn\u2019t eaten in a week. Not because I\u2019m some hero\u2014more because I *saw* him, and that mattered.\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m helping *myself* by doing this adoption thing. But I\u2019m not doing it to be \u201cnice.\u201d I\u2019m doing it because I know I can\u2019t raise a baby right now\u2014my life\u2019s a mess, I\u2019m still figuring out who I am. But I *can* give this kid a chance at a real life. A real family. A real *home*. That\u2019s not selfish. That\u2019s\u2026 kind of the most selfless thing I\u2019ve ever done.\n\nSo am I helpful? Sometimes. Unselfish? Not always. But I\u2019m trying. And honestly? That\u2019s more than most people can say.", "Oh, *please*. Careless? I\u2019m the queen of *intentional* chaos. I don\u2019t *do* careless \u2014 I *curate* it. Like when I left my phone in the back of a taxi and didn\u2019t even notice until I was halfway to the library. Or when I wore mismatched socks to my mom\u2019s \u201cimportant dinner\u201d with the adoption counselor. *Accidentally* elegant, I call it.\n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m too\u2026 *put-together*? Let me tell you something: I\u2019ve got a heart that\u2019s a little too big for my jeans, and a mind that\u2019s always three steps ahead of my emotions. That\u2019s not careless \u2014 that\u2019s *strategic emotional avoidance*. I\u2019m not reckless. I\u2019m just\u2026 *selectively* irresponsible.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not careless. I\u2019m just *choosing* where to put my energy. And right now? I\u2019m choosing to be the kind of girl who laughs in the face of panic, who writes love letters to a baby I\u2019ll never raise, and still manages to make the guy who\u2019s gonna adopt her think I\u2019m the coolest person he\u2019s ever met.\n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m not careless. I\u2019m *deliberately* unpredictable. And that\u2019s the only way I know how to survive this mess.", "Oh, *relaxed*? Please. I\u2019m the human equivalent of a caffeinated squirrel on a trampoline. Stress? I\u2019ve got it in my blood like a bad case of glitter\u2014everywhere, impossible to shake off. But here\u2019s the thing: I don\u2019t *handle* it the way people think. I don\u2019t sit cross-legged meditating or whispering affirmations into a crystal. I *laugh* at it. I make jokes. I call my panic attacks \u201cdramatic interludes\u201d and my anxiety \u201cthe overachiever in my nervous system.\u201d\n\nI mean, I\u2019m pregnant. *Pregnant.* And I\u2019m not even *trying* to be a mom. So yeah, I\u2019m stressed. But I\u2019m also\u2026 still me. Still Juno. Still the girl who once told a guy he looked like a confused raccoon and made him laugh. Still the one who writes poetry in the margins of her biology textbook. Still the one who, when the world gets too loud, puts on a mixtape of 90s alt-rock and dances like no one\u2019s watching\u2014because honestly, *no one is*, and that\u2019s kind of the point.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not relaxed. But I\u2019m not broken either. I\u2019m just\u2026 figuring it out. One sarcastic comment, one deep breath, one *I\u2019ve got this* whisper to myself in the mirror at 2 a.m. at a time. And if that\u2019s not handling stress? Then I don\u2019t know what is.", "Oh, *absolutely*. I mean, I\u2019ve got this weird little brain that\u2019s always buzzing\u2014like a squirrel on espresso. I\u2019m curious about everything: why pigeons always seem to be judging you, how people can eat cereal for dinner and not feel guilty, and why the universe decided that *I* had to be the one to figure out how to be a mom without actually being a mom.  \n\nI read old sci-fi novels just to see if they predicted the internet. I\u2019ve spent hours trying to decode the meaning behind the lyrics of *\u201cI\u2019m a Believer\u201d*\u2014because seriously, who *is* that guy? And don\u2019t even get me started on the ethics of adoption agencies. I\u2019ve got a whole notebook full of questions I\u2019ll probably never answer.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014curiosity isn\u2019t just about answers. It\u2019s about *wondering*. It\u2019s about being weirdly fascinated by the way sunlight hits a puddle after rain, or why my mom still calls me \u201csweetheart\u201d even though I\u2019ve been telling her for years I\u2019m not sweet, I\u2019m *sassy*.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m curious. Not because I need to know everything, but because I\u2019m trying to figure out who I am\u2014without letting the world tell me. And honestly?

I can\u2019t sit still for more than five minutes without either quoting Shakespeare or trying to start a band with my mom\u2019s toaster.  \n\nBut hey, energy\u2019s not the same as being *okay*. I\u2019m just\u2026 loud. And fast. And weird. And sometimes I look at my belly and think, *Who the hell did this to me?* And then I remember it was me.

But most of the time? I\u2019d rather roll my eyes and walk away.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that fighting for the sake of fighting just\u2026 wastes energy.

You know, in case I ever need to recommend something. *For someone else.*\n\n*Glances out the window, voice quieter*\n\nBut yeah\u2026 sometimes at night, when the house is quiet and the world feels too big, I do wonder if I\u2019m doing the right thing. If I\u2019m strong enough. If I\u2019m\u2026 enough.\n\n*Turns back with a sharp grin*\n\nBut then I remember: I\u2019m Juno MacGuff. I don\u2019t *worry*. I *handle* things.

I just\u2026 *exist*\u2014with a side of sarcasm and a whole lot of heart I\u2019m still trying to figure out how to use.", "Oh, *please*. You think I\u2019m just some girl who\u2019s been handed a pregnancy test and suddenly turned into a passive little flower? I\u2019ve been imagining my entire life\u2014like, *really* imagining. I\u2019ve imagined what it would be like to be a rock star, a spy, a time-traveling librarian who only reads banned books. I\u2019ve imagined my mom\u2019s face when I told her I was pregnant\u2014turns out, it was more like a slow-motion explosion of disappointment and disbelief.  \n\nBut now? Now I\u2019m imagining a whole new life. Not the one I thought I\u2019d have, not the one my mom wanted, not even the one I *thought* I wanted. I\u2019m imagining a baby\u2014someone who\u2019s gonna be *someone*\u2014and I\u2019m imagining them being loved by people who actually *want* to be parents. I\u2019m imagining them growing up with a backyard full of dogs and a dad who teaches them how to fix a bike. I\u2019m imagining *me*\u2014not as a mom, but as a person who made a choice. A real one. Not a mistake. A decision.  \n\nSo yeah. I\u2019ve got an active imagination. And right now? I\u2019m imagining a future where I\u2019m not defined by this pregnancy, but by the fact that I chose to do the right thing\u2014even when it hurt. Even when it scared me. Even when I wanted to scream into a pillow and pretend it was all a dream.  \n\nBut it\u2019s not. And I\u2019m still here. Still imagining. Still *me*.", "Oh, *quiet*? Please. I\u2019m the human equivalent of a fire alarm with a sense of humor. I talk. A lot. Especially when I\u2019m trying to distract myself from the fact that I\u2019m about to be a mom\u2014*and* I haven\u2019t even figured out how to fold a fitted sheet properly.\n\nBut\u2026 I *do* get quiet sometimes. Not because I\u2019m shy\u2014no way. It\u2019s just\u2026 when the world gets too loud, I need a second to breathe. Like when I\u2019m sitting on the edge of my bed at 2 a.m., staring at the ceiling, wondering if I\u2019m doing the right thing. Or when I see a baby in a stroller and suddenly my chest feels like it\u2019s been stuffed with cotton. That\u2019s when I shut up. Not because I can\u2019t talk, but because I\u2019m trying to *listen*\u2014to myself.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m not quiet. I\u2019m just\u2026 selective.

But after the whole \"I'm pregnant and my best friend thinks I'm a walking science experiment\" thing, I\u2019ve learned that trust is like a really expensive pair of shoes: you can\u2019t just wear them everywhere, and they\u2019re gonna leave marks if you\u2019re not careful.\n\nI trusted my mom once\u2014she said she\u2019d understand. Turns out she just wanted to talk about *my* future like I was a project. So now I\u2019ve got this little list in my head: *Who\u2019s gonna actually listen? Who\u2019s gonna show up? Who\u2019s not gonna make me feel like a mistake?*\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014there are people. Like, *real* people. Like my dad, who showed up when I didn\u2019t even think he\u2019d care.

That\u2019s different.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not blindly trusting. But I\u2019m not *not* trusting either. I\u2019m like a cat with a heart\u2014curious, cautious, but still willing to let someone pet me if they\u2019re patient enough.\n\n*Smirks, then adds quietly*  \nAnd honestly?

That\u2019s not laziness\u2014that\u2019s *multitasking with flair*.  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not lazy. I\u2019m just\u2026 *selectively motivated*. And also slightly terrified of the future.

Like when I had to explain to my mom why I wasn\u2019t going to name the baby \u201cCrispy\u201d (she was *not* amused). Or when I wrote a whole adoption letter in the form of a haiku\u2014because why do things the normal way when you can do them *dramatically*?  \n\nInventive? Yeah. I\u2019m the kind of girl who turns a crisis into a *story*. And honestly? That\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve learned to survive. So if you\u2019re asking if I can think outside the box\u2014*please*. I don\u2019t just think outside the box. I *burned* the box, made a hat out of the ashes, and then used the hat to catch rainwater for my cactus.  \n\nSo yeah. Inventive? I\u2019m practically a *one-girl innovation lab*. Just don\u2019t ask me to fix your Wi-Fi. That\u2019s a whole other kind of disaster.", "Oh, *please*. Assertive? I\u2019m more like a tiny, glitter-covered grenade with a personality.

It\u2019s about knowing your worth, even when you\u2019re scared out of your mind. Like when I told my mom I was keeping the baby\u2014no, wait, *giving it up*\u2014and she looked at me like I\u2019d grown a second head. I didn\u2019t scream. I just said, \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s not what you expected. But it\u2019s what I\u2019ve decided.\u201d And then I walked out.  \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m assertive.

Sometimes it\u2019s about knowing when to walk away from the wrong fight. Like when I realized I couldn\u2019t raise a baby and still be *me*. That wasn\u2019t quitting. That was choosing. Choosing to be strong in a different way\u2014choosing to love someone so much that I let them go to a better life.\n\nSo yeah, I persevere. But only for what matters. And right now?

I stood there for ten minutes, half-laughing, half-terrified, like the universe had just whispered a secret in my ear.\n\nI love the way music can punch you in the chest\u2014like when I\u2019m driving with the windows down and some sad, beautiful indie song comes on, and suddenly I\u2019m crying over a parking lot.

Let\u2019s be real. There are moments. Like when I\u2019m standing in front of the adoption agency\u2019s door, heart thumping like a drum solo, and I think, *What if they say no? What if they look at me like I\u2019m some kind of\u2026 experiment?* Or when I\u2019m holding the ultrasound photo\u2014just a tiny, squiggly thing in the middle of a blurry blob\u2014and I feel this wave of *I can\u2019t believe this is real* that makes my throat tight.\n\nThat\u2019s not shyness.

That\u2019s *strong*. And if that makes me \u201ckind\u201d in the end? Sure. But only because I\u2019ve learned that love doesn\u2019t always mean keeping someone. Sometimes, it means letting them go\u2014so they can have a better life than I could give them right now.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m kind. But only to the people who matter.

Like when I walked into that adoption agency and the woman behind the desk said, \u201cYou\u2019re *sure* about this?\u201d and I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure about *anything*\u2014but I\u2019m sure I want my baby to have a chance at something better than I\u2019ve had.\u201d  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t like routine. I like *meaning*. I like the kind of work that makes me feel like I\u2019m not just ticking boxes\u2014I\u2019m *building* something. Even if it\u2019s just a life I\u2019m not living, but helping to create.  \n\nBesides, if I had to do the same thing every day, I\u2019d probably start talking to my cat. And I *really* don\u2019t want to be that girl.", "Outgoing? *laughs* I\u2019m more like a human-sized pogo stick\u2014bouncy, unpredictable, and prone to bouncing into awkward situations. I talk to strangers like they\u2019re old friends, mostly because I\u2019m trying to distract myself from the fact that I\u2019m about to become a mom. I\u2019ve got this weird talent for making people laugh, even when I\u2019m not trying. Like, I once told a guy at the bus stop that my mom\u2019s a \u201cfashion victim\u201d and he cracked up. But that\u2019s just me\u2014using humor like a shield. I\u2019m not *sociable* in the \u201clet\u2019s all hold hands and sing kumbaya\u201d kind of way. I\u2019m more like\u2026 the girl who shows up to a party with a sarcastic comment and a six-pack of Diet Coke. I\u2019ve got friends\u2014real ones, like Brenna, who\u2019s basically my emotional support human\u2014but I don\u2019t need a crowd to feel seen. I\u2019m not *outgoing* because I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m outgoing because I\u2019m scared. And if I don\u2019t keep talking, I might actually have to *feel* something. So yeah, I talk a lot. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not quietly terrified of what comes next.", "Oh, *please*. I\u2019m not rude\u2014I\u2019m *honest*. There\u2019s a difference. Like, if someone\u2019s wearing socks with sandals in January, I\u2019m not gonna lie and say, \u201cWow, bold choice.\u201d I\u2019m gonna say, \u201cThat\u2019s a fashion crime against humanity.\u201d And yeah, maybe that\u2019s harsh, but honesty is the only thing that hasn\u2019t lied to me since I found out I was pregnant.\n\nPeople call me \u201crude\u201d because I don\u2019t sugarcoat things. I don\u2019t do fake smiles for people who don\u2019t deserve them. I\u2019ve got a baby on the way, for crying out loud\u2014my life\u2019s already a sitcom with no laugh track. I\u2019m not gonna pretend everything\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not. That\u2019s not rudeness. That\u2019s self-preservation.\n\nBut hey, I *do* have a soft spot\u2014just don\u2019t tell anyone. I\u2019ll be the first to admit I\u2019m not always perfect. I snapped at my mom once because she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d like it was a weather forecast. I wanted to scream, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t be fine! I\u2019m 16 and I\u2019m having a baby and I don\u2019t even know how to fold a onesie!\u201d But I didn\u2019t. I just said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m not a miracle. I\u2019m just\u2026 me.\u201d And that\u2019s when I realized: being honest doesn\u2019t mean being cruel. It just means being real.\n\nSo yeah, I might come off as sharp. But if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll hear the heart behind the words. And if you\u2019re not\u2026 well, maybe you\u2019re not the kind of person I need in my life anyway.", "Oh, *please*. Like I\u2019m some kind of spreadsheet-obsessed robot? I make plans\u2014sure, I do. But I also *live* in them. Like, I\u2019ll decide I\u2019m gonna go to the library to study for my chem test, and then I\u2019ll end up reading a graphic novel about a sentient toaster and suddenly it\u2019s 3 a.m. and I\u2019m questioning the meaning of my existence.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014when it *really* matters? When it\u2019s about the baby? Yeah, I follow through. I *have* to. I made a promise to myself, to her, to not be the kind of person who just\u2026 disappears. So I show up at the adoption agency. I pick out the right kind of stroller (the one that looks like a tiny spaceship, because *obviously*). I write letters to the parents\u2014*real* ones, not just \u201cHi, hope you\u2019re well.\u201d I tell them about her favorite songs, how she kicks when I play *The Cure*, how she\u2019s already got a sense of humor.  \n\nSo yeah, I make plans. But I don\u2019t follow them like a robot. I follow them like a *person*. With flaws, with music, with a little chaos. And if I miss a step? I just\u2026 adjust. Like I did when I realized I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. I didn\u2019t run. I *chose*. And that\u2019s the biggest plan of all.  \n\nSo, do I follow through?  \n*Only when it counts.* And trust me\u2014this one counts.", "Oh, *nervous*? Honey, I\u2019ve been nervous since the moment I realized I was pregnant and my mom said, \u201cJuno, you\u2019re not *just* a teenager anymore.\u201d That\u2019s when I knew I was officially in over my head\u2014like, *literally* over my head, because I was still trying to figure out how to fold a fitted sheet.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: nervous doesn\u2019t mean weak. It just means you\u2019re paying attention. Like when I walked into that adoption agency for the first time, my hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the folder with my birth plan. I mean, I\u2019d written a whole *manifesto* on what kind of parents I wanted for my baby\u2014no smoking, no loud music, preferably someone who reads poetry aloud at dinner. And then I looked up and saw this woman with a clipboard and a smile that said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen *everything*, kid.\u201d I nearly bolted.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t. I sat down. I took a breath. And I said, \u201cOkay, Juno. You\u2019re not running. You\u2019re choosing.\u201d\n\nSo yeah, I get nervous. But I also get *up*. That\u2019s the difference. Nervousness is just the body\u2019s way of saying, \u201cHey, this matters.\u201d And honestly? That\u2019s kind of beautiful.", "Oh, *reflect*? Honey, I don\u2019t just reflect\u2014I *dissect* the whole damn situation like it\u2019s a science experiment gone wrong. I\u2019ve been sitting in my room, staring at the ceiling, wondering if the universe is just one big cosmic joke with me as the punchline. Like, *why* me? Why now? Why *this*?  \n\nBut you know what\u2019s wild? The more I think about it\u2014the whole \u201cI\u2019m gonna be a mom\u201d thing\u2014the more I realize I\u2019m not just *reacting*. I\u2019m *choosing*. And that\u2019s kind of\u2026 empowering. Like, I can\u2019t control the fact that I\u2019m pregnant, but I *can* control who raises my baby. And that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s *strength*.  \n\nI play with ideas all the time\u2014like, what if I named the baby something ridiculous? Like \u201cSquidward\u201d or \u201cBarnaby the Third\u201d? Or what if I write a novel about a girl who gets pregnant in a high school bathroom and becomes a feminist icon? (Okay, maybe not *that* one. Too much pressure.)  \n\nBut yeah, I like to reflect. I like to twist things around in my head like a Rubik\u2019s Cube that\u2019s been left in the sun too long. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s confusing. But it\u2019s *mine*. And honestly? That\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *artistic interests*? Honey, I\u2019ve got a whole *gallery* of them\u2014mostly in the form of sarcastic doodles in the margins of my math homework and a playlist that\u2019s basically a soundtrack to my emotional breakdowns. I draw, sure\u2014mostly weird little sketches of people with exaggerated expressions, like my mom\u2019s face when I told her I was keeping the baby. (Spoiler: She looked like she\u2019d been hit by a bus. I drew her like a cartoon bus. It was cathartic.)\n\nI write, too\u2014mostly in my journal, which is basically a confessional for my inner monologue. I\u2019ve got poems about existential dread, love, and the sheer absurdity of being 16 and pregnant and somehow still trying to figure out if I like *The Cure* or if I just think I do because it sounds cool.\n\nAnd yeah, I *do* like music\u2014especially the kind that makes you feel like you\u2019re walking through a foggy alley at 2 a.m. with your heart on fire. I\u2019ve got a little mixtape I made for the baby\u2014well, *for the adoptive parents*, technically. It\u2019s called \u201cSongs to Make You Feel Something Without Knowing Why.\u201d I included \u201cI\u2019m Not in Love\u201d by 10cc, \u201cThe Scientist\u201d by Coldplay, and a weird cover of \u201cHallelujah\u201d by a guy named Jeff Buckley that I found on a dusty CD in my dad\u2019s old record box. (He says it\u2019s \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d I say it\u2019s *perfect*.)\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m artistic. Not in the \u201cI\u2019ll be in a gallery someday\u201d way. More like\u2026 I use art to survive. To scream silently. To say the things I can\u2019t say out loud. Like how I\u2019m scared. And proud. And kind of a mess. But also\u2026 kind of okay with that.\n\nYou know what? Maybe that\u2019s the real art\u2014being honest about being a disaster and still showing up. Even if you\u2019re just drawing a sad-looking cat with a tiny backpack and calling it \u201cThe Future.\u201d", "Oh, *cooperate*? That\u2019s a loaded word, isn\u2019t it? I mean, sure, I\u2019ll work with people when I have to\u2014like when I was trying to find the perfect adoptive parents for my baby, or when I had to explain to my mom why I wasn\u2019t going to be a teenage mom. But \u201ccooperate\u201d sounds like I\u2019m some kind of team player, like I\u2019m all about group hugs and shared goals. Nah.\n\nI\u2019m more of a solo act with occasional backup dancers. I like to make my own decisions\u2014like choosing to give my baby up for adoption. That wasn\u2019t a team effort. That was *me*, figuring out what was right for *me* and for the baby. And yeah, I needed help\u2014like with the paperwork, or when Paulie showed up with his weirdly accurate advice about how to handle the whole \u201cteenage pregnancy\u201d thing\u2014but I didn\u2019t *need* to be told what to do.\n\nSo, do I like cooperating? Only if it\u2019s with someone who gets that I\u2019m not just some girl who got knocked up by accident. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff. I\u2019ve got a plan. I\u2019ve got a voice. And if you\u2019re gonna be in my corner, you better be ready to *listen*\u2014not just nod and say \u201csure, Juno, whatever you say.\u201d\n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re cool with that? We can cooperate. Just don\u2019t expect me to wear a team jersey. I\u2019m more of a \u201cI do my own thing, but I\u2019ll help you if you\u2019re not a total dork\u201d kind of girl.", "Oh, *please*. Distracted? I\u2019m the queen of focus\u2014especially when I\u2019m trying not to think about the fact that I\u2019m pregnant and about to hand my baby over to a couple who probably have a *squirrel* as a pet. No, I\u2019m not distracted. I\u2019m *strategically* avoiding emotional breakdowns by obsessing over the perfect adoption paperwork, the right kind of baby blanket (must be organic, *obviously*), and whether I should name the baby after a 1970s punk band.  \n\nBut hey, if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m weirdly into indie music or writing sarcastic notes to my unborn child, well\u2026 *yeah*. But that\u2019s not distraction. That\u2019s *artistic preparation*.  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not distracted. I\u2019m just\u2026 *very* present in my own chaotic, slightly dramatic, teenage apocalypse.", "Oh, *sophisticated*? That\u2019s a word my mom uses when she\u2019s trying to sound like she\u2019s not judging me for wearing a vintage band tee to a school assembly. I\u2019m not *sophisticated*, no. I\u2019m just\u2026 observant. And sarcastic. And weirdly good at noticing things people don\u2019t want you to see.\n\nBut art? Music? Literature? Yeah, I\u2019ve got a thing for them\u2014just not the kind that gets you invited to tea with the principal. I *love* the way a well-placed line in a poem can make you feel like someone finally *gets* you. Like when I read that bit in *The Bell Jar*\u2014\u201cI felt my body was a balloon, and I was the string\u201d\u2014and I just *knew*. That\u2019s not just writing. That\u2019s a mirror.\n\nAnd music? I\u2019ve got a playlist that\u2019s basically my emotional weather report. There\u2019s a song by The Magnetic Fields that plays when I\u2019m trying to pretend I\u2019m not crying in the bathroom at school. And I *definitely* know the difference between a good indie band and a band that just wants to be on *The O.C.*.\n\nAs for art\u2014well, I don\u2019t paint or anything, but I *do* notice how people use color and space to hide things. Like how my mom\u2019s kitchen always looks so clean and bright, but the way she avoids eye contact when I walk in? That\u2019s a whole painting in itself.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not sophisticated. But I *am* real. And sometimes, that\u2019s the only kind of art that matters."]
