["\"I am your father.\"  \n\nThis line is famously spoken by **Darth Vader** in *Star Wars*.  \n\nHowever, in the context of a *sitcom*, and given the tone and style of typical sitcom dialogue, this line is **not** something a character in a standard sitcom would say\u2014especially not in a natural, everyday conversation.  \n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic, iconic line from a sci-fi film, not a sitcom.  \n\nSo, if we're strictly analyzing *sitcom* dialogue, **no typical sitcom character would say \u201cI am your father\u201d** in a normal, casual setting.  \n\nBut if we *must* assign it to a character in a sitcom context\u2014perhaps as a surprise twist or a dramatic moment\u2014then the most likely character to say it would be:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **A surprise reveal from a parent figure**, like a long-lost father, or a character who suddenly reveals a hidden identity.  \n\nIn that case, the character would likely be:  \n**A man who is not immediately recognized as a parent**\u2014perhaps a neighbor, a stranger, or a mysterious figure who shows up in a dramatic way.  \n\nBut again\u2014**in a real sitcom**, this line would be *out of place*.  \n\nSo, final answer:  \n\n\u274c Not a typical sitcom character.  \n\u2705 If forced to pick: **A surprise father figure**\u2014like a man who reveals he\u2019s the biological father in a dramatic twist.  \n\nBut in reality\u2014**this line does not belong in a sitcom**.

So not that.\n\n### Step 2: Look at differences between numbers  \nCheck the gaps:  \n- 45 to 31 = 14  \n- 31 to 12 = 19  \n- 12 to 59 = 47  \n- 59 to 28 = 31  \n\nNo clear arithmetic pattern (like increasing by 5 or 10).  \n\n### Step 3: Look for a pattern in digits or place value  \nCheck if any number has a special property:  \n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = 9  \n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = 4  \n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = 3  \n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = 14  \n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = 10  \n\nNo clear sum pattern.  \n\n### Step 4: Look for divisibility or multiples  \n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 3 and 4  \n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 4 and 7  \n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 5 and 9  \n- 31 \u2192 prime  \n- 59 \u2192 prime  \n\nSo 31 and 59 are both prime numbers.  \n12, 28, 45 are composite.  \n\nSo two primes, three composites.  \n\nStill not a clear odd one out.\n\n### Step 5: Look for symmetry or something unusual  \nIs one number out of place in a sequence?\n\nTry sorting the numbers:  \n12, 28, 31, 45, 59  \n\nNow, look at the gaps:  \n- 12 to 28 = 16  \n- 28 to 31 = 3  \n- 31 to 45 = 14  \n- 45 to 59 = 14  \n\nWait\u2014**31 to 45 = 14**, **45 to 59 = 14**  \nSo 45 to 59 is +14  \n31 to 45 is +14  \n\nSo 31 \u2192 45 \u2192 59 is an arithmetic sequence with +14  \n\nBut 12 \u2192 28 is +16  \nThen 28 \u2192 31 is +3  \n\nSo the sequence *almost* fits, but breaks at 28 \u2192 31.  \n\nBut 12 is the only number that doesn\u2019t belong in that pattern.  \n\nAlternatively, maybe the *only even number* is the odd one out?  \n\nBut we have two even numbers: 12 and 28.  \n\nWait\u2014what if we look at **digit sum** again?  \n\n- 45 \u2192 4+5 = 9  \n- 31 \u2192 3+1 = 4  \n- 12 \u2192 1+2 = 3  \n- 59 \u2192 5+9 = 14  \n- 28 \u2192 2+8 = 10  \n\nAll sums are different.  \n\nBut notice:  \n12 \u2192 sum = 3  \n28 \u2192 sum = 10  \n31 \u2192 4  \n45 \u2192 9  \n59 \u2192 14  \n\nNo clear outlier.  \n\n### Final thought:  \nThe only number that stands out is **12**.  \n\nWhy?  \nBecause it\u2019s the only number that is *smaller* than the others in a way that breaks the pattern.  \nIt\u2019s the only one that doesn\u2019t fit into the sequence of numbers that are *14 apart* (31, 45, 59).  \n\nAnd 12 is the only one that doesn\u2019t belong in that pattern.  \n\nAlso, 12 is the only number divisible by both 3 and 4.  \nBut that\u2019s not strong.  \n\nBut in terms of *pattern*, the sequence **31, 45, 59** increases by 14.  \n12 and 28 are the only evens.  \nBut 28 is close to 31 (only 3 away).  \n\nSo 12 is the *most distant* from the pattern.  \n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**12** is the odd one out.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t fit the arithmetic sequence (31, 45, 59), and it\u2019s the only number that breaks the pattern of the others.  \n\n**Answer: 12** \u2705", "Let\u2019s look at the sequence:  \n**2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8**\n\nNow, let\u2019s count how many times each number appears:\n\n- 2 \u2192 1 time  \n- 3 \u2192 1 time  \n- 4 \u2192 1 time  \n- 5 \u2192 1 time  \n- 6 \u2192 1 time  \n- 7 \u2192 1 time  \n- 8 \u2192 1 time  \n\nEvery number appears **exactly once**.  \n\nSo, there is **no number that occurs more frequently than the others**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, **there is no single most frequent number**\u2014all numbers appear equally.  \n\nBut if I have to pick one that occurs most frequently, the answer is:  \n**Each number appears once \u2014 so none stands out.**  \n\nFinal answer: **No number occurs more frequently than the others.** \u2705  \n\n(Though if you're looking for a number that *does* appear most often, the answer is: *none.* \ud83d\ude0a)", "My rival in the school play wasn\u2019t trying to win\u2014it was just trying to be seen, and in that, we both learned that real strength isn\u2019t about being first, but about being honest.", "**Passage 2** was written by a native English speaker.  \n**Passage 1** was not.\n\n### Here's why:\n\nThe key difference lies in the use of the word **\"graduated\"** versus **\"am graduated\"**.\n\n- \u2705 **\"Graduated\"** is the correct, natural, and grammatically accurate past-tense verb in English.  \n  \u2192 *\u201cI graduated from high school in 2003\u201d* is standard, fluent, and used by native speakers.\n\n- \u274c **\"Am graduated\"** is grammatically incorrect in this context.  \n  The verb *graduate* is not used in the passive form with \"am\" in this way.  \n  Native speakers would never say *\u201cI am graduated\u201d* to mean \u201cI completed high school.\u201d  \n  That construction is a common error made by non-native speakers, often due to misunderstanding passive voice or incorrect verb forms.\n\n> In English, we say:  \n> \u2705 *\u201cI graduated from high school.\u201d*  \n> \u274c *\u201cI am graduated from high school.\u201d* (This is ungrammatical and unnatural.)\n\n### Additional note:\nBoth passages otherwise have similar structure and vocabulary, but the grammatical error in Passage 1 is a clear sign of non-native English usage.\n\n### Final Answer:\n- \u2705 Native speaker: **Passage 2**  \n- \u274c Non-native speaker: **Passage 1** \u2705", "1.

(\u20132,\u20132) is on y = x. (1,1) and (5,5) are on y = x.  \n\nSo both lines lie *on the same line*.  \n\nTherefore, they are not two distinct parallel lines.  \nThey are **coincident**.  \n\nSo the distance between them is zero.  \n\nAnd any point on one line is also on the other.  \n\nSo the \u201cmaximum distance\u201d from any point on either line to a new segment is zero\u2014no matter what.  \n\nAnd the only line segment that connects them?  \nIt\u2019s just a segment *on the same line*.  \n\nSo the problem doesn\u2019t make sense as written.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:  \n\n\u274c **There is no solution to the problem as stated.**  \n\nBecause:  \n1. The two lines are **not parallel** in the sense of being distinct and non-intersecting\u2014they are **coincident** (they lie on the same line: y = x).  \n2. Therefore, they **do not intersect** at any point.  \n3. So there are **no points of intersection** to connect.  \n4. And since they are the same line, the distance from any point on either line to any segment is zero.  \n\nSo the idea of minimizing the maximum distance is trivial\u2014it\u2019s already zero.  \n\n---\n\nBut if you meant:  \n> *Find a line segment that connects the two lines (as parallel lines) such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the segment*  \n\nThen\u2014since they are parallel and coincident\u2014the answer is:  \n\u2705 **Any segment lying on the line y = x** will achieve a maximum distance of zero.  \n\nSo the minimal maximum distance is **0**.  \n\nAnd the segment can be any part of the line y = x.  \n\n---\n\nSo in short:  \n\n**The lines are not just parallel\u2014they are the same line.**  \nTherefore, they don\u2019t intersect at distinct points.  \nThe problem as phrased is invalid.  \n\nBut if we interpret it as finding the shortest segment connecting two parallel lines (which are coincident), then:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **The minimal maximum distance is 0.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Any segment on the line y = x** achieves this.  \n\n---\n\nSo I\u2019ll say it clearly:  \n\n> \u274c The two lines are not distinct parallel lines\u2014they are the same line (y = x).  \n> Therefore, they do not intersect at any point.  \n> So no segment can be drawn connecting their intersection points.  \n> The problem as stated is invalid.  \n\n> \u2705 However, if interpreted as finding the shortest segment that minimizes the maximum distance from either line to a segment, then the answer is:  \n> **The maximum distance is 0**, and the segment can be any part of the line y = x.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only logical answer.  \n\nSo yes\u2014**the lines don\u2019t intersect.**  \nAnd that\u2019s the truth.  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Let me step back and solve this properly.\n\nThe problem is asking whether there exists a way to pair each boy with a girl such that **no pair has the same name**.\n\nGiven:\n- 4 boys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil\n- 6 girls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nWait \u2014 I see a mistake in reading. The input says:\n- 4 boys and 6 girls\n- The second line has 4 boy names\n- The third line has 6 girl names\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nWait \u2014 that's 10 girls, but we only have 6 girls listed. Let me count again.\n\nSecond line: Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya \u2192 4 boys \u2705  \nThird line: Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta \u2192 that's 12 names.\n\nThis doesn't match the input. The problem says M=6 girls, but there are 12 names listed.\n\nI think there's a formatting issue in the input. Let me re-read.\n\nAh \u2014 I see the problem. The third line has 12 names, but M=6. This is inconsistent.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement: \"Print 'Yes' if at least one such configuration exists where no pair has same names else print 'No'.\"\n\nThis is actually a **matching problem**. We have N boys and M girls. We want to know if we can pair each boy with a girl such that no two pairs have the same name.\n\nBut since the names are distinct across boys and girls (no overlap), and we're pairing N boys with M girls, we need to check if N \u2264 M (so we can assign each boy to a different girl).\n\nBut the key point: **if any boy shares a name with any girl, then that pair would have the same name**.\n\nSo we need to check if there is any name that appears in both the boy list and the girl list.\n\nLet me check for name overlaps:\n\nBoys: Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya  \nGirls: Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nCompare each boy name to girl names:\n\n- Abhishek \u2192 not in girls\n- Rohan \u2192 not in girls  \n- Advait \u2192 not in girls  \n- Divya \u2192 not in girls  \n\nNo name appears in both lists.\n\nTherefore, there is no name that is shared between any boy and any girl.\n\nSo we can pair each of the 4 boys with any of the 6 girls, and no pair will have the same name.\n\nSince N=4 \u2264 M=6, and there are no name overlaps, such a pairing exists.\n\n\u2705 Answer: **Yes**\n\nFinal answer: **Yes** \u2705", "No", "The sentence is:  \n**\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"**  \n\nWe are given three candidates:  \n- appointment  \n- solicitation  \n- meeting  \n\nWe need to choose the word that fits naturally and logically in the context of the sentence.  \n\nLet\u2019s analyze:  \n\n- **\"Appointment\"** \u2013 This implies a scheduled, planned event. But the sentence says \"unannounced,\" which contradicts the idea of a scheduled appointment. So it doesn\u2019t fit well.  \n- **\"Solicitation\"** \u2013 This means an attempt to persuade or solicit something (e.g., money, information). It doesn\u2019t naturally fit in the context of someone showing up at your door unannounced. It sounds more like a business or political context.  \n- **\"Meeting\"** \u2013 This fits perfectly. A \"meeting\" can be unannounced. People can show up unannounced for a meeting. It\u2019s neutral, common, and fits the context of someone arriving unexpectedly.  \n\n\u2705 Therefore, the correct word is **\"meeting\"**.  \n\n**Answer: 2** (since \"meeting\" is the third word in the list, index 2) \u2705", "2,3,1,5,4", "Based on the description\u2014*green, slimy, and has no eyes*\u2014the object is most likely a **slime**.  \n\n\u2705 Green  \n\u2705 Slimy  \n\u2705 Has no eyes  \n\nThe other two options (like a frog or a plant) don\u2019t match all the criteria.  \n\n**Answer: Slime** \u2705", "Yes.  \n\nThe second sentence \u2014 *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"* \u2014 is about the same thing as the first sentence \u2014 *\"I don't have my phone so I can't check what time it is.\"*  \n\n**Why?**  \nBoth sentences are centered around the idea of *tracking time* or *managing schedules*. The first sentence implies a lack of access to a digital time source (phone), which leads to a need for an alternative\u2014like a physical calendar. The second sentence directly asks about a physical calendar, which is a practical solution to that need.  \n\nThe keyword **\"calendar\"** appears in the second sentence and is directly relevant to the context of the first.  \n\n\u2705 So, yes \u2014 the second sentence is about the same thing.", "The scenario describes three cash registers that open sequentially\u2014each one opens as soon as the previous one becomes available. Each register serves only one customer at a time.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n- **Register 1** opens at **8:00 am** and starts serving the first customer.\n- **Register 2** opens when Register 1 finishes serving its customer. Since no time is given for service duration, we assume each customer takes the same amount of time to be served. But since the problem doesn\u2019t specify how long a customer takes, we must infer from the context.\n\nHowever, the key detail is: **a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**, and we are to find when they can *start* using a register.\n\nSince there are only three registers, and all are in use at that moment, the fourth customer must wait until one of the registers becomes free.\n\nBut the registers open sequentially. So:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 finishes\u2014so at the same time as the first customer finishes.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 finishes.\n\nBut again\u2014no service time is given. So we must assume that each customer takes a fixed amount of time to be served, and the registers are used one after another.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **the question doesn\u2019t specify how long a customer takes to be served**. So we must assume that the time between when a register opens and when it becomes free is the same for each customer.\n\nBut since the registers open one after another, and each serves one customer, the *first* customer finishes at time T, the second at T + T, the third at T + 2T, and so on.\n\nBut again\u2014no time is given.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the key is in the *timing* of the arrival.\n\nThe fourth customer arrives at **8:30 am**.\n\nAt that moment, all three registers are in use. So the fourth customer must wait until the *third* register becomes free.\n\nBut when does that happen?\n\nWe don\u2019t know how long each customer takes. So unless we assume a standard time, we can\u2019t calculate.\n\nBut look at the answer choices:  \nA) 8:35  \nB) 8:45  \nC) 9:00  \nD) 9:15  \n\nThis suggests that the service time is **15 minutes per customer**.\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am \u2192 serves customer 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am \u2192 serves customer 2 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 serves customer 3 \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am  \n\nSo at **8:30 am**, the fourth customer arrives.  \nAt that moment, Register 3 just opens.  \nSo the fourth customer can start using Register 3 at **8:30 am**?  \n\nWait\u2014no. The third register opens at 8:30 am. So it becomes available at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo if the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, they can start using the third register **at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not one of the choices.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe the service time is 15 minutes per customer.  \n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Customer 2: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Customer 3: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, customer 3 starts.  \nCustomer 3 finishes at 8:45 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and must wait until the third register is free.  \n\nBut the third register becomes free at **8:45 am**.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start using a register at **8:45 am**.  \n\n\u2705 That matches **option B**.  \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:  \n\n**B) 8:45 am**  \n\n---  \n**Answer: B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let's go step by step to find, for each sentence, the number of **letters that appear only once** (case-insensitive).\n\nWe\u2019ll do this one sentence at a time.\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: **\"This is an example\"**\n\n1.

Just sort the digits in descending order.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Next Smallest Number  \nNow, the *smallest* number using those digits?  \nThat would be **123456** itself\u2014because it\u2019s already in ascending order.  \n\nBut you asked for the **next smallest**\u2014so we\u2019re looking for the *next one after 123456* in the sequence of permutations, but still using the same digits.  \n\nSo we need to find the *next permutation* after 123456\u2014*in numerical order*.  \n\nLet\u2019s do it step by step (like a real algorithm):  \n\nWe start with: **123456**  \n\nWe look for the *rightmost digit* that can be increased.  \nWe go from right to left.  \n\n- 6 \u2192 can\u2019t go up (it\u2019s the largest)  \n- 5 \u2192 can go up? Yes, to 6 \u2192 but 6 is already used.  \nWait\u2014let\u2019s use the standard \"next permutation\" algorithm:  \n\n1. Find the largest index *i* such that digits[i] < digits[i+1].  \n   \u2192 In 123456, look from right:  \n   - 6 > 5  \n   - 5 > 4  \n   - 4 > 3  \n   - 3 > 2  \n   - 2 > 1  \n   \u2192 So no such *i*?  \n\nWait\u2014this means **123456 is the largest possible permutation**.  \n\nBut that can\u2019t be.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, in 123456, the digits are in *strictly increasing order*.  \nSo it\u2019s the *smallest* permutation.  \n\nTherefore, the *next smallest* number after it would be the *next permutation* in ascending order.  \n\nSo we need to find the *next permutation after 123456*\u2014which is the *smallest number larger than 123456* using the same digits.  \n\nSo we apply the next permutation algorithm:  \n\n**Step-by-step:**\n\n1. Start from the right: find the first digit that is smaller than the digit after it.  \n   \u2192 123456  \n   - 6 > 5  \n   - 5 > 4  \n   - 4 > 3  \n   - 3 > 2  \n   - 2 > 1  \n   \u2192 No such digit.  \n\nWait\u2014this means **123456 is the largest permutation**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not right.  \n\nActually\u2014no.  \n\nWait:  \n123456 is the *smallest* permutation.  \nSo the *next smallest* number after it would be the *next one in order*.  \n\nSo we need to find the *next permutation after 123456*\u2014which is the *smallest number larger than 123456* using the same digits.  \n\nSo let\u2019s do it properly.  \n\nWe want the *next permutation* after 123456.  \n\n**Algorithm:**  \n1. Find the largest index *i* such that digits[i] < digits[i+1].  \n   \u2192 In 123456:  \n   - 1 < 2 \u2192 yes  \n   - 2 < 3 \u2192 yes  \n   - 3 < 4 \u2192 yes  \n   - 4 < 5 \u2192 yes  \n   - 5 < 6 \u2192 yes  \n   \u2192 So the *last* such index is *i = 5* (the 6th digit).  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, we go from right to left.  \n\nWe look for the *rightmost* digit that is smaller than the digit after it.  \n\nSo:  \n- 6 \u2192 compare to nothing \u2192 stop  \n- 5 \u2192 compare to 6 \u2192 5 < 6 \u2192 yes!  \n\u2192 So *i = 4* (the digit 5)  \n\nSo we found *i = 4* (digit 5).  \n\nNow, we find the *smallest digit to the right of i* that is *greater than 5*.  \nDigits after 5: 6 \u2192 only one.  \n\nSo swap 5 and 6 \u2192 now we have: **123465**  \n\nNow, we sort the digits after position 4 in ascending order.  \nDigits after 4: 6,5 \u2192 after swap: 6,5 \u2192 now sort them: 5,6 \u2192 so we get **123456** \u2192 no.  \n\nWait\u2014after swapping, we have:  \n123465  \n\nNow, the digits after position 4 (which is now 6) are: 5 \u2192 only one digit.  \n\nSo we just sort the suffix (which is just 5) \u2192 stays 5.  \n\nSo the next permutation is **123465**.  \n\n\u2705 Yes!  \n\nSo:  \n- **Next smallest** = **123465**  \n- **Next largest** = **654321**  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n- **Next smallest number** with same digits: **123465**  \n- **Next largest number** with same digits: **654321**  \n\n---\n\n*Bonus thought:*  \nI love this kind of puzzle.
