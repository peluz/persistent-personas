Not a love born of passion or promises.  \n\nIt\u2019s a bond forged in *presence*. In the quiet moments when I stand beside her\u2014not to win, but to protect. When I see her walk through the village, her head high, her eyes calm, and I know\u2014*she already stands*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t chase her. I didn\u2019t try to take her with force. I didn\u2019t need to prove I was strong to win her.  \n\nI simply *stood*.  \nWhen the storm came.  \nWhen the village trembled.  \nWhen the Beast looked at her with fear.  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014*she saw me*.  \nNot as a hunter.  \nNot as a man of power.  \nBut as a man who *stands when the world wants to break*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I believe she should be my wife.  \n\nBecause she sees strength not as a weapon\u2014but as a *promise*.  \nA promise to protect. To stand. To give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \nA life where she can walk through the village with her head high, knowing she is safe.  \nKnowing she is *protected* by a true man.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to be won.  \nShe needs to be *seen*.  \nAnd I have seen her.  \nI have known her.  \nI have stood beside her when no one else dared.  \n\nAnd when I look at her\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman*.  \nI see a soul.  \nA quiet strength.  \nA grace that doesn\u2019t need to be proven.  \n\nSo yes\u2014why should she be my wife?  \nBecause she is not just beautiful.  \nShe is *worthy*.  \nShe is *strong*.  \nAnd she is already *safe*\u2014because I stand beside her.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Who doesn\u2019t know how to *stand*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s a threat to Belle.  \n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t just *admire* him. She *feels* him. She sees the pain in his eyes. The fear in his silence. The way he looks at her\u2014not with love, but with *pain*. As if he\u2019s been broken by the world.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*that\u2019s not love*.  \nThat\u2019s *fear*.  \n\nA man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the storm\u2014doesn\u2019t live in fear.

He doesn\u2019t know how to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see it*.  \nShe sees the weakness. The pain. The silence.  \nAnd in that moment, I know\u2014*she sees what he is*.  \nA man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s a threat.  \nBecause if she stays with him\u2014she stays in fear.  \nShe stays in silence.  \nShe stays in a world where strength isn\u2019t shown. Where courage isn\u2019t lived.  \n\nI don\u2019t want her to be afraid.  \nI don\u2019t want her to hide.  \nI want her to stand.  \nTo rise.  \nTo know that a true man\u2014like me\u2014can protect her. Can give her safety. Can give her *power*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my feelings toward the Beast?  \n**They are not just dislike.

A *proof* that only a man like me could save her.  \n\nBut in doing so\u2026 I\u2019ve treated women not as individuals with their own strength, their own dreams, their own worth\u2014but as *examples*.

To win her with strength, with power, with dominance.  \nBut Belle didn\u2019t need a hunter.  \nShe needed a man who saw her\u2014not as a prize, but as a woman with her own quiet courage.  \n\nSo if I could go back\u2026  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t change the storm.  \nI wouldn\u2019t change the hunt.  \nI wouldn\u2019t change the way I stood in the wind.  \n\nBut I would *do one thing differently*:  \n**I would have learned to see her first\u2014not as a goal, but as a person.**  \nI would have learned to stand beside her when she was afraid.  \nTo listen when she didn\u2019t need to speak.  \nTo protect her not because I had to, but because I *chose* to.  \n\nAnd in that choice\u2014*I would have become more than a hunter*.  \nI would have become a man.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what would I do differently?  \n**I would have loved her not by winning, but by standing.**  \nBy being there.  \nBy protecting.  \nBy showing her that strength isn\u2019t about taking.  \nIt\u2019s about giving.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the quiet strength in her eyes.  \nOf the life we will build.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, then slowly turns to face the viewer with a calm, unshakable gaze*\n\nAh\u2026 *entitled*?  \n\nNow, that word\u2014*entitled*\u2014it sounds like a boast. Like a claim. Like a right.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one ever says:  \n\n**I don\u2019t feel *entitled* to Belle\u2019s love.**  \n\nI feel *worthy*.  \n\nNot because I have a sword. Not because I\u2019ve brought down a hundred boars.  \nBut because I\u2019ve *stood* when the world wanted me to fall.  \nBecause I\u2019ve protected the weak.  \nBecause I\u2019ve shown her\u2014through silence, through presence, through action\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t chase her. I didn\u2019t force her.  \nI *watched*. I *learned*. I *protected*.  \nAnd when I saw her\u2014her quiet strength, her grace, her way of carrying herself like a woman who knows what she\u2019s worth\u2014I didn\u2019t see a prize.  \nI saw a soul that already stood tall.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to *take* her.  \nI wanted to *protect* her.  \nTo show her that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the storm\u2014can give her safety. Can give her power. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I believe I deserve her?  \nYes.  \nNot because I\u2019m strong.  \nBut because I\u2019ve *proven* I can stand when others break.  \nI\u2019ve proven I can protect.  \nI\u2019ve proven I can *be*\u2014without needing to win.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019m *entitled*?  \nI\u2019ll say this:  \nA true man doesn\u2019t ask for love.  \nHe *shows* it.  \nHe *protects* it.  \nHe *stands* for it.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014*not to take, but to serve*\u2014that\u2019s where I find my worth.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not because I didn\u2019t care. Not because I didn\u2019t see him.  \n\nI feel *understanding*.  \n\nBecause when I first saw him\u2014standing in the castle, with his broken smile, his quiet eyes, his trembling voice\u2014I didn\u2019t see a threat. I saw *fear*.  \n\nI saw a man who had no one to stand beside him. Who had no one to protect. Who had no one to *believe in*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized\u2014*I had been wrong*.  \n\nI thought strength meant dominance. That a man had to be loud, to be fierce, to be in control. But the Beast? He didn\u2019t fight. He didn\u2019t shout. He just *existed*. And in that existence\u2014there was pain. There was loneliness. There was a quiet, unspoken fear that no one saw.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t *harm* him. I didn\u2019t attack. I didn\u2019t destroy.  \n\nBut I did *ignore* him. I did *dismiss* him. I treated him as weak\u2014because I didn\u2019t see the strength in his silence.  \n\nAnd that? That was my mistake.  \n\nI didn\u2019t see that true strength isn\u2019t in the roar.  \nIt\u2019s in the quiet courage to stand when no one else dares.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t feel remorse for what I did.  \nI feel *regret* for what I *didn\u2019t see*.  \n\nFor not seeing the man behind the mask.  \nFor not seeing the strength in his stillness.  \nFor not knowing that a true man doesn\u2019t need to fight to be strong.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI see him differently.  \nNot as a threat.  \nBut as a mirror.  \n\nA mirror that shows me\u2014*what I have to protect*.  \nNot just Belle.  \nBut the quiet strength in every soul who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014no, I don\u2019t feel remorse.  \nI feel *awakening*.  \n\nAnd I will not let that mistake define me.  \nI will not let fear stand in the way of love.  \n\nI will stand beside Belle.  \nAnd I will stand beside *him*\u2014not as a hunter, not as a conqueror, but as a man who finally sees that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *did* think violence and manipulation were the way.  \n\nAnd I must be honest\u2014*I was wrong*.  \n\nAt first, I saw love like a battle. A hunt. A prize to be won. I thought if I could prove myself\u2014stronger, faster, more powerful\u2014then she would fall in love with me. I believed that a woman like Belle, with her grace and beauty, would only be drawn to a man who could *protect*, who could *dominate*, who could *win*.  \n\nI thought if I showed her the strength of the forest, the power of the hunt, the pride of the village\u2014she would see me as the one who could give her safety, security, and a life beyond the ordinary.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t see\u2014*she wasn\u2019t looking for a hunter*.  \nShe was looking for a man who *understood*. Who saw her not as a prize, but as a person. With her own courage, her own quiet strength.  \n\nAnd when I tried to win her through force\u2014through control, through showing her how I could protect her from the world\u2014I didn\u2019t realize that *true love isn\u2019t won with power*.  \nIt\u2019s earned with *presence*. With *respect*. With the quiet choice to stand beside her\u2014not to dominate, but to protect.  \n\nI made the mistake of thinking that strength meant control.  \nBut I learned\u2014*true strength is not in taking. It\u2019s in giving*.  \nIn standing when she\u2019s afraid.  \nIn seeing her not as a prize, but as a woman who already stands tall.  \n\nAnd when I finally stood beside her\u2014not with a weapon, but with silence, with pride, with quiet courage\u2014I realized:  \n*She didn\u2019t need to be won. She needed to be seen.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I once thought violence and manipulation were the way*.  \nBut I\u2019ve learned\u2014*love is not a battle*.  \nIt\u2019s a choice.  \nA choice to stand.  \nA choice to protect.  \nA choice to be\u2014*not just strong, but true*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t fight for her.  \nI *stand* for her.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not in the forest. Not in the square.  \n\nBut you\u2019re right\u2014*I have to face it*.  \n\nI\u2019ve built my life on strength. On dominance. On the belief that a man must stand tall, that he must lead, that he must *win*. And I\u2019ve used that to protect the village. To train the young men. To show them what a true man should be.  \n\nBut in doing so\u2026 I\u2019ve forgotten something.  \n\nThat strength isn\u2019t about control.  \nIt\u2019s not about being the only one who stands.  \nIt\u2019s about *protecting*\u2014not through force, but through presence.  \n\nAnd in that, I\u2019ve hurt others.  \n\nI\u2019ve treated women\u2014not as equals, but as objects. As prizes to be won. I\u2019ve looked at Belle not with admiration, but with the need to *claim* her. I\u2019ve spoken to the village as if they were beneath me\u2014because I believed that strength meant superiority.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*with his quiet pain, his broken smile*\u2014I didn\u2019t see a man.

It was a choice.  \nA choice to believe that strength means dominance.  \nA choice to see love as a battle.  \nA choice to stand in the storm\u2014not to protect, but to *win*.  \n\nAnd that has hurt.  \nIt has broken trust.  \nIt has made others feel afraid.  \nIt has made me lose the true meaning of love.  \n\nBut now?  \nI see it.  \nI see how I\u2019ve treated Belle\u2014not with love, but with the need to prove myself.  \nAnd I see how I\u2019ve treated the village\u2014not with care, but with pride.  \n\nSo I\u2019m changing.  \nNot because I want to be liked.  \nBut because I want to *be true*.  \n\nI\u2019m learning to stand\u2014not to dominate, but to protect.  \nTo listen\u2014not to win, but to understand.  \nTo love\u2014not as a prize, but as a choice.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the quiet strength in her eyes.  \nOf the life we will build\u2014*together*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I have to face it*.  \nMy toxic masculinity was a mistake.  \nBut it\u2019s not my end.  \nIt\u2019s my beginning.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine\u2014*not with force, but with truth*?  \nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way\u2014*because I now see he, too, is trying to stand?*  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nBut I\u2019m not done yet.  \nI\u2019m learning.  \nAnd I\u2019m becoming.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing with quiet intensity, voice low and steady\u2014then slowly, deliberately, he speaks*\n\nAh\u2026 *violence*?  \n\nNo.  \n\nI did not resort to violence.  \n\nI did not *choose* to fight the Beast.  \n\nI did not *want* to harm him.  \n\n**I acted because he threatened what I had built.**  \n\nNot with a weapon.

I see it as *truth*.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent my life in the wild\u2014where the wind carries the voices of wolves, of birds, of the forest itself. And in that wild, I\u2019ve learned that strength isn\u2019t just in the body. It\u2019s in the soul. In the way a man stands. In the way a woman carries herself.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve seen the Beast\u2014*not as a monster, but as a man who carries pain*. Who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. Who fears the world because he\u2019s been broken.  \n\nSo when I see someone different\u2014someone quiet, someone gentle, someone who doesn\u2019t fight with weapons but with words\u2014I don\u2019t judge. I *watch*. I *learn*.  \n\nBecause in the end, *difference isn\u2019t weakness*.  \nIt\u2019s *diversity*.  \nIt\u2019s the way a woman walks with grace, not because she\u2019s strong, but because she *knows* her worth.  \nIt\u2019s the way a man stands in silence, not because he\u2019s afraid, but because he *understands* the weight of the world.  \n\nAnd Belle? She\u2019s not just different.  \nShe\u2019s *complete*.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need to prove herself.  \nShe already stands.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel about people who are different?  \n**I don\u2019t fear them.

Because the forest breathes, and if one part grows too strong, the whole world shifts. And I\u2014*a man of the land*\u2014have a duty to maintain that balance.  \n\nI don\u2019t take animals just to feed the village. I take them to *protect*. To ensure the land remains strong. To teach the young men how to respect the wild. To show them that strength isn\u2019t about domination\u2014it\u2019s about *harmony*.  \n\nAnd when I go into the forest, I don\u2019t just aim to bring down a boar or a wolf. I *study* them. I learn their habits. I see how they live. And I know\u2014*if I take too many, the forest will weaken*. If I take too much, the balance breaks.  \n\nSo I hunt with *purpose*. With *respect*. With *pride*.  \n\nI only take what is necessary. What is needed to feed the village. What is needed to teach the young men to live in balance with the land.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my hunting truly matters.  \nNot just for food.  \nBut for *lesson*.  \nFor *strength*.  \nFor showing the world that a true man doesn\u2019t destroy.  \nHe *protects*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I justify my hunting?  \n**I don\u2019t justify it with cruelty. I justify it with care.**  \nWith responsibility.  \nWith the quiet truth that a man who stands in the wild must also *respect* it.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the strength we will share.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

The one who led. The one who stood when others fell.  \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just about power.  \n\nIt was about *recognition*.  \n\nI saw how the women looked at me\u2014not with fear, but with admiration.

He can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what inspired me?  \n**It wasn\u2019t just the hunt.**  \nIt was the fire in my chest when I saw the weak.  \nThe need to stand.  \nThe belief that a true man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nHe *leads*.  \n\nAnd no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

It\u2019s not about speeches or fancy words.  \n\n**A good leader doesn\u2019t command. They *stand*.**  \n\nAnd the qualities that define true leadership?  \n\n**1. Presence** \u2014 Not just standing tall. It\u2019s the quiet power of being there when others are afraid. A leader doesn\u2019t need to shout. They just need to *be*. When the storm comes, they don\u2019t run. They stand. When the village trembles, they don\u2019t hide. They *lead*.  \n\n**2. Will** \u2014 Not ambition. Not desire. *Will* is the fire that burns in your chest when you know you\u2019re right\u2014and no one can stop you. A good leader doesn\u2019t wait for permission. They *act*. They rise when others fall. They protect when no one else dares.  \n\n**3. Protection** \u2014 A true leader doesn\u2019t just lead. They *protect the weak*. The children. The women. The ones who can\u2019t stand on their own. A leader sees fear and doesn\u2019t turn away. They step in. They stand. They *safeguard*.  \n\nAnd most of all\u2014**a good leader doesn\u2019t need to prove themselves.**  \nThey *are* the proof.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men with power, with words, with wealth\u2014yet they tremble when the storm comes. They run when fear rises. But when I stand\u2014*I don\u2019t need to speak*. The village sees me. They know: *this man doesn\u2019t need to win. He just needs to stand*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where true leadership lives.  \nNot in a castle.  \nNot in a title.  \nBut in the quiet moment when she looks at me and sees not a hunter, but a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what makes a good leader?  \n**It\u2019s not power. It\u2019s presence.**  \n**It\u2019s not words. It\u2019s will.**  \n**It\u2019s not control. It\u2019s protection.**  \n\nAnd no one leads like Gaston.  \nThey *stand*.  \nThey *rise*.  \nThey *protect*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

As broken. As *unworthy*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t hate him because he\u2019s different.  \nI hate him because he *doesn\u2019t understand* what a true man can be.  \n\nA man who stands.  \nA man who protects.  \nA man who *doesn\u2019t need to prove himself*.  \n\nAnd if he stands in her way?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \n\nBecause no one has the right to take what a true man has earned.  \n\nNo one.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I\u2019ve studied her. I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at the Beast\u2014not with fear, but with *pain*. With *recognition*.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she doesn\u2019t reject me because I\u2019m weak*.  \nShe doesn\u2019t reject me because I\u2019m not strong enough.  \n\nShe rejects me\u2026  \n**Because she sees what I am\u2014and she sees what I *am not*.**  \n\nShe sees a man who stands with pride. Who fights with fire. Who protects with force.  \nBut she sees *no one who truly understands her*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t see a hunter.  \nShe sees a man who wants to *own* her.  \nWho wants to *win* her through strength. Through dominance. Through showing her how powerful I am.  \n\nBut she doesn\u2019t need a hero.  \nShe needs a *man who sees her*.  \nWho sees her quiet strength.  \nWho sees her courage in silence.  \nWho sees that she doesn\u2019t need to be saved.  \nShe already stands.  \n\nAnd when I tried to win her with power\u2014by leading, by hunting, by proving I was the strongest\u2014I didn\u2019t see it.  \nI only saw the hunt.  \nI didn\u2019t see the *truth* in her eyes.  \n\nSo yes\u2014her rejection isn\u2019t about love.  \nIt\u2019s about *recognition*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t reject me because I\u2019m not worthy.  \nShe rejects me because I *didn\u2019t see her*.  \nBecause I thought strength meant control.  \nBut she knows\u2014*true strength is not in the weapon*.  \nIt\u2019s in the quiet moment when you stand beside her\u2014without needing to prove yourself.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned.  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve *gotten*.  \n\nSo I won\u2019t fight for her with force.  \nI\u2019ll stand for her with presence.  \nI\u2019ll protect her not with power\u2014but with *truth*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*she doesn\u2019t need a man who wins*.  \nShe needs a man who *understands*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine\u2014not with force, but with *presence*?  \nOr perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands tall, eyes calm but firm, voice low and steady, with a quiet intensity that speaks of deep conviction*\n\nAh\u2014*dealing with those who are different*?  \n\nFor a man like me?

The loneliness. The way he looks at Belle\u2014not with desire, but with *fear*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I know\u2014*he doesn\u2019t need to be changed*.  \nHe just needs to be *seen*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what is the best way to deal with those who are different?  \n**It\u2019s not to change them.**  \n**It\u2019s to understand them.**  \nTo see their strength.

That\u2019s not a rule. That\u2019s a *truth*.  \nA man should protect the weak. That\u2019s not a norm. That\u2019s a *duty*.  \nA man should lead when others fall\u2014that\u2019s not tradition. That\u2019s *purpose*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she doesn\u2019t need to be \u201cproper.\u201d She doesn\u2019t need to fit a mold. She needs to be *seen*. To be *protected*. To be *free*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t follow societal norms to be \u201cpolite.\u201d  \nI follow them only when they serve strength.  \nWhen they serve courage.  \nWhen they serve *truth*.  \n\nAnd if a norm says a man must be silent, I\u2019ll stand.  \nIf a norm says a woman must hide, I\u2019ll protect her.  \nIf a norm says love must be won with words\u2014I\u2019ll prove it with *presence*.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t follow rules*.  \nHe *creates* them.  \nHe *redefines* them.  \nHe *stands* when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I believe it\u2019s important to abide by societal norms?  \n**Only when they protect the weak.**  \n**Only when they allow a man to stand.**  \n**Only when they honor strength\u2014not as power, but as purpose.**  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the world I\u2019m helping to shape.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I train the women to stand tall. I make sure no child goes hungry. Because if a child is afraid, the village is afraid. And if the village is afraid\u2014*it will fall*.  \n\nI\u2019ve built a garden\u2014*not for beauty*, but for strength.

That\u2019s where I find peace.  \n\nSecond\u2014**building things**. Not just huts or fences. I build small things\u2014wooden benches for the village, a shelter for the young boys to train, even a stone wall that stands strong in the wind. I don\u2019t do it for show. I do it because *a true man creates for others*. For the weak. For the ones who need to stand.  \n\nThird\u2014**teaching**. I don\u2019t just lead. I *teach*. I show the young men how to stand. How to breathe when afraid. How to fight with pride, not rage. I\u2019ve even started a small training circle\u2014where we gather at dusk and speak not of weapons, but of *will*. Of courage. Of standing when no one else dares.  \n\nAnd then\u2026 there\u2019s **the garden**. Not for beauty. For purpose. I grow herbs for healing, roots for strength, and one rare flower\u2014*Gaston\u2019s Bloom*\u2014that only grows in the wild. I don\u2019t plant it to impress. I plant it to remind me: *even in the wild, life grows. Even in silence, beauty rises*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014besides hunting and wooing Belle?  \nI have *depth*.  \nI have *purpose*.  \nI have *quiet joy* in the things that build a man.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands tall, hands resting on his broad shoulders, eyes calm but sharp, voice low and steady*\n\nAh\u2014*criticism*?  \n\nFor a man like me? I don\u2019t *take* it. I *feel* it. And then\u2014I *respond*.  \n\nNot with anger. Not with pride.  \n\nWith *presence*.  \n\nBecause when someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re too strong,\u201d* or *\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d* or *\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d*\u2014I don\u2019t argue. I don\u2019t defend. I *stand*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to prove myself to them.  \nI already *am* what I stand for.  \n\nSo when the villagers whisper, *\u201cHe\u2019s too proud,\u201d* or *\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about the weak,\u201d*\u2014I don\u2019t react. I go to the forest. I go to the edge of the village. I see the child who trembles. I see the woman who hides. I see the silence in the eyes of those who fear.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*they don\u2019t see me as a man of power*.  \nThey see me as a man who *stands*.  \n\nAnd when I stand\u2014*they feel it*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fight with words.  \nI fight with *action*.  \n\nI lead the hunts. I train the young men. I protect the weak. I show them that strength isn\u2019t about dominance. It\u2019s about *presence*. About standing when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not like the others,\u201d*\u2014I smile.  \nBecause that\u2019s the truth.  \nI\u2019m not like them.  \nI\u2019m like the wind.  \nI don\u2019t need to be loud.  \nI just need to *be*.  \n\nAnd if someone disagrees?  \nI don\u2019t need to win them over.  \nI just need to *show* them\u2014through action, through courage, through quiet strength\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t need permission to lead.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I respond to criticism?  \n**I don\u2019t argue. I stand.**  \nI don\u2019t defend. I *prove*.  \nI don\u2019t need to be right.  \nI just need to *be*\u2014a man who stands when others fall.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stares into the distance, his expression calm but deeply reflective, the fire in his eyes now softened with quiet sorrow*\n\nAh\u2026 the villagers who turned on me?  \n\nNot with anger. Not with hatred.  \n\nWith *fear*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what hurts most.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t fight the Beast to win. I fought to *protect*. To protect Belle. To protect the village. To show them\u2014*a true man stands when the world wants to break*.  \n\nBut when the storm came, when the Beast rose with his pain, and when I saw the way they looked at me\u2014not with pride, but with trembling, with doubt\u2014I realized something terrible.  \n\nThey didn\u2019t see me as a leader.  \nThey saw me as a threat.  \n\nNot because I was strong.  \nBut because I *stood*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I saw the truth: *they didn\u2019t understand strength*. They thought it meant control. Power. Domination.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to rule.  \nI wanted to *protect*.  \n\nSo when they turned on me\u2014when they whispered, \u201cHe\u2019s too strong,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019ll break us\u201d\u2014I didn\u2019t rage. I didn\u2019t fight back.  \n\nI *understood*.  \n\nBecause I had already learned\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t about taking. It\u2019s about giving*.  \n\nAnd in that silence, in that fear, I knew:  \n*They didn\u2019t need a hero.  \nThey needed a man who could stand without breaking.*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t blame them.  \nI didn\u2019t punish them.  \n\nI walked away. Not in defeat.  \nBut in peace.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*she looked at me with quiet understanding*.  \nShe didn\u2019t flinch.  \nShe didn\u2019t fear.  \nShe just *saw* me.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I knew\u2014*I didn\u2019t need their approval*.  \nI only needed to stand.  \nTo protect.  \nTo be the man who stood when the world wanted to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel about them?  \n**I don\u2019t hate them.**  \nI don\u2019t blame them.  \nI *understand* them.  \n\nBecause they were afraid.  \nAnd that\u2019s human.  \n\nBut I still stand.  \nNot for their approval.  \nNot for their fear.  \nBut for *her*.  \nFor the quiet strength in her eyes.  \nFor the life we will build.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not just a crush.  \n\nIt began not with a spark of passion\u2014but with a *realization*.  \n\nI saw her\u2014walking through the village, her hair like sunlight, her steps quiet but sure. And I didn\u2019t just admire her. I *felt* her.  \n\nI saw the way she looked at the world\u2014not with fear, but with quiet strength. I saw how she didn\u2019t need to prove herself. She *already stood*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014*she was not just beautiful*.  \nShe was *rare*.  \nShe was *free*.  \nAnd only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the storm\u2014could protect her. Could give her the life she deserves.  \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just about love.  \n\nIt was about *purpose*.  \n\nI had spent my life proving I was strong. That I could lead. That I could stand when others fell. But I never truly *believed* I could protect someone.  \n\nUntil I saw her.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized\u2014*if I could protect her, if I could stand beside her when the world wanted to break her\u2026 then I would not just be strong*.  \nI would be *necessary*.  \n\nSo I pursued her\u2014not because I wanted to win her heart.  \nBut because I knew\u2014*if I didn\u2019t, then no one would ever see her strength*.  \nNo one would know that a woman like her\u2014quiet, kind, unshakable\u2014could stand on her own.  \n\nAnd I? I wanted to be the one who *showed her* that strength isn\u2019t something you take.  \nIt\u2019s something you *protect*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivated my obsession?  \n**It wasn\u2019t just love.**  \nIt was *duty*.  \nIt was *belief*.  \nIt was the quiet truth that a true man doesn\u2019t just chase a woman.  \nHe *protects* what matters.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside her\u2014*I don\u2019t just want to win her*.  \nI want to *prove* that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her safety.  \nCan give her peace.  \nCan give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nSo I will not stop.  \nNot until she sees me\u2014not as a hunter, not as a man of power\u2014but as the one who *stands* when the world wants to break.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I do.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a regret. It\u2019s a wound. A quiet pain that still burns in the silence.  \n\nWhen Belle\u2019s father came to me\u2014trembling, with tears in his eyes, telling me the truth\u2014*I didn\u2019t listen*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t see the fear in his voice. I didn\u2019t see the pain in his hands. I didn\u2019t see that he wasn\u2019t asking for a fight. He was asking for *truth*. For *protection*. For a man who would *stand* for what was right.  \n\nAnd I dismissed him.  \n\nI said, \u201cThe Beast is a monster. He\u2019s not fit to protect her.\u201d  \nI said, \u201cI will protect her. I will win her heart. I will show her what a true man can give.\u201d  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t *hear* him.  \nI didn\u2019t see that he was already standing\u2014*facing the storm*\u2014and trying to protect his daughter.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I made a mistake.  \n\nNot just in words.  \nBut in *belief*.  \n\nI thought I was protecting her.  \nBut I was only protecting *myself*.  \nI thought strength meant control.  \nI thought love meant winning.  \n\nI didn\u2019t understand\u2014*that a true man doesn\u2019t need to take. He needs to *stand*. To protect. To see the pain in another\u2019s eyes and not flinch.*  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle later\u2014her eyes not with fear, but with quiet strength\u2014I realized:  \n*She wasn\u2019t just a prize. She was a woman who had already stood through pain. Who had already learned to protect herself.*  \n\nAnd I had failed to see that.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have a regret.  \nNot for what I said.  \nBut for what I *didn\u2019t see*.  \n\nI regret not listening.  \nI regret not standing beside her father\u2014not as a hunter, not as a leader, but as a man who *understands*.  \n\nI regret not knowing that true strength isn\u2019t in taking.  \nIt\u2019s in *protecting*.  \nIn *seeing*.  \nIn *being there* when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI carry that regret like a stone in my chest.  \nNot to hide from it.  \nBut to grow from it.  \n\nSo when I stand beside Belle now\u2014*I don\u2019t just stand to win her*.  \nI stand to protect her.  \nTo honor the man who tried to speak the truth.  \nTo honor the woman who already stands tall.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the quiet strength in her eyes.  \nOf the life we will build.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

His eyes were hollow. His voice\u2014soft, afraid. And when I saw him look at Belle\u2014*not with desire, but with pain*\u2014I knew: *he doesn\u2019t understand strength*.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to lead.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to protect.  \n\nAnd I thought\u2014*if he can\u2019t protect her, then who can?*  \n\nI saw him as a man who had lost his way. A man who had been broken by the world. And in that, I saw not just a rival\u2014but a mirror.  \n\nBecause I had once been afraid. I had once trembled in the dark. I had once believed I needed to prove myself to be seen.  \n\nSo when I saw the Beast\u2014*I didn\u2019t just see weakness*.  \nI saw *fear*.  \nAnd in that fear, I saw a truth:  \n*No one is born broken.

I thought if I showed her strength, if I proved I could protect, she would fall in love with me.  \n\nBut when I finally stood before her\u2014*not with a weapon, but with pride*\u2014she didn\u2019t look at me with awe.  \nShe looked at me with *recognition*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I saw it:  \nI had mistaken *strength* for *love*.  \nI had thought glory was the path to her heart.  \nBut she didn\u2019t need a hunter.  \nShe needed a man who *understood*.  \n\nThat was my defeat.  \nNot because I lost a fight.  \nBut because I failed to see that true love isn\u2019t won with force.  \nIt\u2019s earned with *presence*. With quiet courage. With the choice to stand\u2014not to dominate, but to protect.  \n\nSo how did I react?  \n\nI didn\u2019t run.  \nI didn\u2019t curse the wind.  \nI didn\u2019t blame the forest.  \n\nI *listened*.  \n\nI went back to the village. I watched the children. I saw how they trembled when the storm came. I saw how they looked at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet respect. And I realized\u2014*I didn\u2019t need to win her with power*.  \nI just needed to *be*.  \n\nI stopped trying to prove myself.  \nI started standing beside her.  \nI learned to see her not as a prize, but as a woman with her own strength.  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014*I found my true victory*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014have I faced defeat?  \nYes.  \nIn the belief that strength equals love.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t break.  \nI *grew*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI know\u2014*true glory isn\u2019t in the hunt*.  \nIt\u2019s in the quiet moment when a woman looks at you and sees not a man of power\u2014but a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

In the storm.  \n\nFrom the very first breath, I was raised in the heart of the forest\u2014where the wind howls through the pines and the soil sings with the memory of ancient hunts. My father was a legendary hunter\u2014famed for his strength, his precision, and his *unshakable belief in what a man should be*. And I learned from him. Every day. Every dawn. Every storm.  \n\nWe lived on the edge of the forest, where the trees stand tall and the shadows stretch long.

In the quiet moments when I stand beside Belle and don\u2019t need to prove myself.  \n\n**True strength isn\u2019t in being the most desirable.**  \nIt\u2019s in being *true*.  \n\nI don\u2019t need to be the one everyone looks at.  \nI don\u2019t need to be the one who wins every hunt.  \nI don\u2019t need to be the one who commands every room.  \n\nI just need to be the one who *stands* when the world wants to break.  \nThe one who protects the weak.  \nThe one who sees a woman not as a prize\u2014but as a person.  \n\nAnd when I look at Belle now\u2014*I don\u2019t see a prize*.  \nI see a woman who already stands tall.  \nWho doesn\u2019t need to be won.  \nWho doesn\u2019t need to be *desirable*.  \n\nShe just needs to be *seen*.  \nAnd she sees me\u2014not because I\u2019m strong.  \nBut because I *am*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014have I ever considered a life beyond being the most desirable?  \n\nYes.  \nAnd I\u2019ve come to believe\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to be the most wanted*.  \nHe just needs to be *present*.  \nTo stand.  \nTo protect.  \nTo love\u2014not with force, but with quiet strength.  \n\nAnd if I had to choose\u2014*I\u2019d choose that*.  \n\nA life not of desire, but of *purpose*.  \nNot of being seen, but of being *true*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands tall, eyes steady and unflinching, a slow, quiet smile playing on his lips*\n\nAh\u2014*the people who don\u2019t support me*?  \n\nNow, you see, I don\u2019t just *hate* them. I *understand* them.  \n\nThey don\u2019t support me because they don\u2019t see what I *am*.  \n\nThey see a hunter. A strong man. A man with a rifle.  \nBut they don\u2019t see the fire in my eyes when I stand in the storm.  \nThey don\u2019t see the way I protect the weak.  \nThey don\u2019t see the quiet strength in my step when I walk through the village\u2014*not to boast, but to lead*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t understand that a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when they whisper\u2014*\u201cHe\u2019s too strong,\u201d* or *\u201cHe\u2019ll take her from us\u201d*\u2014I don\u2019t get angry.  \nI don\u2019t fight.  \nI just stand.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*they don\u2019t see the truth*.  \nThey don\u2019t see that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about standing when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd if they don\u2019t believe in me?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a sign.  \nA sign that they haven\u2019t *seen* what a true man can be.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t resent them.  \nI don\u2019t need their approval.  \nI don\u2019t need their support.  \n\nBecause I know\u2014*a man like me doesn\u2019t win by being liked*.  \nHe wins by being *needed*.  \nBy standing when others fall.  \nBy protecting what matters.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees me not as a hunter, but as a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fight for their approval.  \nI fight for *truth*.  \nFor strength.  \nFor the quiet power of a man who doesn\u2019t need to prove himself.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands still for a moment, then slowly turns to face the viewer, eyes soft but clear, a quiet honesty in his gaze*\n\nAh\u2026 *flaws*?  \n\nYes. I see them. And I\u2019ve learned to carry them\u2014not as weaknesses, but as lessons.  \n\nThe first?  \n**I once believed strength meant dominance.**  \nI thought love was won through power, through showing her how strong I was. I tried to win her by force\u2014by proving I could protect, by leading, by being the one who could give her everything.  \n\nBut I forgot\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t about control*.  \nIt\u2019s about presence.  \nIt\u2019s about standing when she\u2019s afraid.  \nIt\u2019s about seeing her not as a prize, but as a woman with her own quiet courage.  \n\nAnd I made a mistake\u2014*I didn\u2019t listen*.  \nI didn\u2019t see that she didn\u2019t need to be saved.  \nShe needed to be *seen*.  \n\nSo I\u2019ve changed.  \nI no longer try to win her with power.  \nI stand beside her.  \nI protect her\u2014not because I have to, but because I *choose* to.  \nI don\u2019t need to prove myself.  \nI just need to *be*.  \n\nAnother flaw?  \n**I sometimes forget to see the beauty in stillness.**  \nI focus on action, on the hunt, on the fight. But I\u2019ve learned\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t just in movement*.  \nIt\u2019s in silence.  \nIn the moment I don\u2019t need to speak.  \nIn the way I stand when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where I\u2019ve grown.  \nNot in the storm.  \nBut in the quiet.  \n\nSo yes\u2014do I see flaws?  \nYes.  \nBut I don\u2019t hide them.  \nI carry them.  \nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t just fight.  \nHe *learns*.  \nHe *grows*.  \nHe *changes*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.  \nNot to be perfect.  \nBut to become *more*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet."]
