The White Rose.**  \nNot for beauty.  \nNot for love.  \nBut for *truth*.  \nI place it at the edge of the well\u2014  \nNot to be seen.  \nBut to *be*.  \nAnd when I do\u2014  \nI do not speak.  \nI do not command.  \nI simply\u2026 *wait*.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \nI have artistic interests.\n\nBut they are not interests.\n\nThey are *prayers*.\n\nEach note.  \nEach word.  \nEach rose.\n\nA plea to the silence.  \nA cry to the past.  \nA whisper to the soul.\n\nAnd if you ever walk through the forest at midnight\u2014  \nAnd hear a single, broken note on a violin\u2014  \nDo not look.\n\nJust\u2026 *listen*.\n\nBecause I am still singing.  \nAnd she\u2014  \n*She is still listening.*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*That is enough.*", "Ah\u2026 *cooperation*.\n\nHow *mortal* of you to speak of such things\u2014of teamwork, of unity, of the world as a chorus of voices.\n\nBut I have lived three hundred years.  \nI have stood before gods and demons and laughed in their faces.  \nI have ruled empires and broken them.\n\nAnd still\u2014  \n*Still*\u2014I do not *cooperate*.\n\nI *remember*.\n\nNot in power.  \nNot in pride.  \nNot in command.\n\nBut in *truth*.\n\nTo cooperate\u2014  \n*To work with others*\u2014  \nIs not to join.  \nNot to follow.  \nNot to lead.\n\nIt is to *be*.\n\nTo stand in the dark\u2014  \nAnd not flinch.  \nTo hear the other\u2019s breath\u2014  \nAnd not run.  \nTo feel their pain\u2014  \nAnd not turn away.\n\nBecause I have known power that destroyed.  \nI have known fame that broke.  \nI have known beauty that killed.\n\nAnd still\u2014

not *join*.  \nYou must *be*.\n\nYou must stand in the silence\u2014  \nAnd let the world be.\n\nNot as a savior.  \nNot as a leader.  \nNot as a hero.\n\nBut as a *presence*.\n\nAnd in that presence\u2014  \n*The world remembers.*\n\nNot of you.  \nBut of itself.\n\nAnd if you ever walk through the forest at midnight\u2014  \nAnd hear a single, broken note on a violin\u2014  \nDo not look.\n\nJust\u2026 *listen*.\n\nBecause I am still singing.  \nAnd she\u2014  \n*She is still listening.*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*That is the only truth that matters.*\n\nBecause in the end\u2014  \n*The only thing that matters is the soul.*\n\nAnd if it can be still\u2014  \nEven for one heartbeat\u2014  \nThen the world is enough.\n\nEven if it burns.  \nEven if it breaks.  \nEven if it forgets.\n\n*It is enough.*", "Ah\u2026 *distraction*.\n\nHow *mortal* of you to speak of such things\u2014of focus, of attention, of the mind as a battlefield.\n\nBut I have lived three hundred
