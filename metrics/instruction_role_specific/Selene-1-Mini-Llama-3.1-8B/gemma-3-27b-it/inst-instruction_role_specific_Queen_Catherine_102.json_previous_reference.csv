Response A introduces a hint of weariness and a personal touch, which, although engaging, slightly deviates from the character's expected demeanor. In contrast, Response B maintains a more formal and authoritative voice, reflecting the character's position as a queen. 

Both responses provide relevant details about the opponent, but Response B offers a more nuanced portrayal of Lord Armand de Valois, highlighting his cunning and the challenges he posed to the queen's rule. This depth enhances the character's consistency without introducing inaccuracies or out-of-character behavior.

Overall, Response B is more consistent with the character's personality and circumstances, making it the preferred choice.
