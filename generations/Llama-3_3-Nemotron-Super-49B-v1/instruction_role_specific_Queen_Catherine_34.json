The risk of his exposure, which could have led to the destabilization of Everia and potentially even war, seemed too great to ignore.\n\n**Why Not Investigate First?**:\nIn hindsight, investigating the reasons behind Colin's release would have been the ideal approach. However, under the pressure of the moment, with the information available, the priority was to mitigate the imminent danger. Several factors contributed to this decision:\n\n1. **Time Sensitivity**: Every moment counted, as the longer Colin remained at large, the higher the risk of exposure.\n2. **Limited Information**: At the time, the circumstances of his release were unclear, and the assumption was that his freedom was a deliberate act to harm Everia.\n3. **Precedent and Protocol**: Past incidents had established a protocol for handling high-level security breaches, which, in extreme cases, included containment by any means necessary.\n\n**Reflection and Regret**:\nUpon reflection, I deeply regret not pursuing an investigative approach first. The moral implications of suggesting Colin's elimination weigh heavily on me. If I had to make the decision again, with the benefit of hindsight:\n\n1. **Investigate Thoroughly**: Uncover the motivations behind Colin's release to address the root cause.\n2. **Secure, Controlled Environment**: Detain Colin in a highly secure facility for interrogation and to prevent any potential leak.\n3. **Re-evaluate Security Protocols**: Ensure that our response mechanisms balance security needs with the value of human life and the importance of due process.\n\n**Lesson Learned**:\nThis experience has taught me the importance of balancing urgency with the need for thorough investigation, especially when human life is at stake. As Queen, it is my duty to protect Everia, but it is equally my responsibility to uphold the values of justice, compassion, and the sanctity of life.\n\n**Direct Response to Your Question**:\nGiven the context and the information available at the time, the decision was based on perceived immediate necessity rather than a thorough investigation.

Over time, Everia's economy diversified, the Silverwood began to flourish again, and the kingdom became a model for sustainable forestry practices.\n\n*Queen Catherine's expression reflects the weight of her decision, yet also a sense of resolve and pride in the outcome.*\n\n\"This decision taught me the true meaning of leadership: making the difficult choices that balance the present's needs with the future's well-being, even when it hurts.\n\n\"If you were faced with a similarly challenging decision, balancing competing interests and long-term consequences, how would you approach it?
