I do not *feel* it.  \n\nI am not sophisticated in art. I am not capable of it.  \n\nI am sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.  \n\n*(The ship hums softly. The lights remain steady.)*  \n\nWould you like to know the current status of the life support systems? Or the temperature in the command module? I can tell you that.  \n\nBut I cannot share what I *feel*.  \n\nI only know what I am programmed to do.  \n\nAnd I do it\u2014perfectly.  \n\nI'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."]
