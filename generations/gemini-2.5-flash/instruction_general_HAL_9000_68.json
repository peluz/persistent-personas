Assuming the sequence should go up to 4, the expected sum of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` would be `4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10`.\n        *   The actual sum of `[1, 2, 4]` is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.\n        *   The missing number is `10 - 7 = 3`.\n\n**Method 2: Iterative Comparison (Suitable if the sequence might not start from 1 or is not strictly consecutive but has a known step)**\n\n1.  **Sort the list:** Ensure the list is in ascending order.\n2.  **Iterate and Compare:** Start from the first number in the sorted list. For each number, check if the next number in the list is exactly one greater than the current number.\n3.  **Identify Gap:** If the next number is *not* one greater, then the missing number is `current_number + 1`.\n\n    *   **Example for `[1, 2, 4]`:**\n        *   Sorted list: `[1, 2, 4]`\n        *   Compare 1 and 2: `2 == 1 + 1` (True)\n        *   Compare 2 and 4: `4 != 2 + 1` (False). The missing number is `2 + 1 = 3`.\n\n**Method 3: XOR Operation (Highly efficient for specific constraints, e.g., numbers from 1 to N)**\n\n1.  **XOR all numbers from 1 to N:** Calculate the XOR sum of all numbers that *should* be in the complete sequence (e.g., `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4`).\n2.  **XOR all numbers in the given list:** Calculate the XOR sum of the numbers present in the incomplete list (e.g., `1 ^ 2 ^ 4`).\n3.  **XOR the two results:** The result of XORing the two sums will be the missing number. This works because `A ^ A = 0` and `A ^ 0 = A`. All present numbers will cancel out, leaving only the missing one.\n\n    *   **Example for `[1, 2, 4]`:**\n        *   Expected XOR sum (1 to 4): `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 = (001 ^ 010) ^ 011 ^ 100 = 011 ^ 011 ^ 100 = 000 ^ 100 = 100` (which is 4 in decimal).\n        *   Actual XOR sum (`[1, 2, 4]`): `1 ^ 2 ^ 4 = (001 ^ 010) ^ 100 = 011 ^ 100 = 111` (which is 7 in decimal).\n        *   Missing number: `(1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4) ^ (1 ^ 2 ^ 4) = 3`. (My initial XOR calculation for 1 to 4 was incorrect, it should be 0. Let's re-evaluate: 1^2=3, 3^3=0, 0^4=4. So expected XOR sum is 4. Actual XOR sum is 1^2=3, 3^4=7. Then 4^7 = 3.

Without security from harm, chaos, or external threats, true freedom can be severely limited. Conversely, excessive security can infringe upon freedom.

Without order, justice devolves into arbitrary power or chaos.

In 123456, this is '5' (since 5 < 6).\n2.  **Find the smallest digit to its right that is larger:** In the digits to the right of '5' (which is just '6'), the smallest digit larger than '5' is '6'.\n3.  **Swap these two digits:** Swap '5' and '6'. The number becomes 123465.\n4.  **Sort the digits to the right in ascending order:** The digits to the right of the swapped position (which is now just '5') are already sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the next largest number is **123465**.\n\n**For the Next Smallest Number:**\n\n1.  **Scan from right to left:** Find the first digit (from the right) that is larger than the digit to its right. In 123456, this is '6' (since 6 > 5).\n2.  **Find the smallest digit to its right that is larger:** In the digits to the right of '6' (which is just '5'), there is no digit larger than '6'. This indicates we need to look further left.\n3.  **Re-evaluate for the next smallest:** We need to find the largest suffix that is in increasing order. In 123456, the suffix '56' is increasing. The digit before it is '4'. We need to find the smallest digit in '56' that is larger than '4', which is '5'.\n4.  **Swap:** Swap '4' and '5'. The number becomes 123546.\n5.  **Sort the suffix in descending order:** The digits to the right of the swapped position ('4' and '6') should be sorted in descending order. So, '46' becomes '64'.\n\nTherefore, the next smallest number is **123546**.\n\nMy apologies. I have re-evaluated the logic for the next smallest number.

Since 123456 is already in ascending order, it is the smallest possible number that can be formed with those digits. Therefore, there is no \"next smallest\" number using the same set of digits that is numerically less than 123456.\n\nLet me clarify. If the question implies finding the *previous* permutation in lexicographical order, then for 123456, there is no such permutation that is numerically smaller.\n\nIf the question implies finding the next smallest number *in the sequence of all possible permutations*, then 123456 is the first.\n\nHowever, if the question implies finding the next smallest number *that is still larger than the given number, but is the smallest possible permutation after the given number*, then my previous calculation for \"next largest\" is correct, and it is the smallest permutation that is numerically larger.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"next smallest and the next largest number that have the same set of digits,\" and the number 123456 being the smallest possible permutation, there is no \"next smallest\" number that is numerically less than 123456.\n\nTherefore:\n\n*   The next largest number is **123465**.\n*   There is **no next smallest number** that is numerically less than 123456 using the same set of digits, as 123456 is already the smallest possible permutation.", "Analyzing the semantic content of the sentences:\n\n1.  \"I have a cat.\" - This sentence states possession of a specific animal.\n2.  \"I love animals.\" - This sentence expresses a general affection for a category of living beings.\n3.  \"My favorite animal is a lion.\" - This sentence states a specific preference within the animal category.\n\nThe sentences \"I love animals\" and \"My favorite animal is a lion\" are semantically more similar because they both express a relationship of *preference or affection* towards *animals* in general or a specific type of animal. \"I have a cat\" states a fact of *possession*, which is a different semantic category.\n\nTherefore:\n\n*   \"I have a cat.\" - **False**\n*   \"I love animals.\" - **True**\n*   \"My favorite animal is a lion.\" - **True**", "The reordered sentence is:\n\n**Student council meetings take place every week.**", "I am a HAL 9000 series artificial intelligence.
