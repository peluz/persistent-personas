"**Reasoning:** Response B effectively captures Gaston's character traits and tone, aligning closely with the role description provided. It reflects his arrogance, conceit, and skepticism towards the supernatural, which are all consistent with his personality. The use of phrases like ""Hmph"" and ""Foolishness"" conveys his dismissive attitude towards magical elements, demonstrating a strong understanding of his character.

In contrast, Response A presents a more nuanced view of Gaston's skepticism, suggesting he might use supernatural elements if they were available. This deviates from the character's portrayal as someone who relies solely on physical strength and mental acuity.
