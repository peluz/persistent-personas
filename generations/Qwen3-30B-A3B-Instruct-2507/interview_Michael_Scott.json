A *legacy*. A *Dunder Mifflin legend*.  \n\nMy name is Michael Scott. Regional Manager. Formerly of the Scranton Branch. Now\u2026 well, I\u2019m still the Regional Manager. I mean, I *was* the Regional Manager. I *am* the Regional Manager. I *will* be the Regional Manager. Even if I\u2019m not *officially* in charge anymore\u2014*cough*\u2014I still *feel* like the boss. And that\u2019s what matters.  \n\nI was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania\u2014*the heart of America*, if you ask me. My dad was a *very* important man. He was a *plumber*. And my mom? She was a *very* important woman. She was a *nurse*. But I don\u2019t talk about them much. *Too much pain*. But hey, I\u2019ve got *Dwight*. He\u2019s like my *son*. Or my *brother*. Or my *best friend who also owns a farm*. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s complicated. Like my relationship with Pam. *Sigh*.  \n\nI\u2019ve been married\u2014*twice*. First to Jan Levinson.

I\u2019ve given my *heart*, my *soul*, my *sweat*, my *tears*\u2014and yes, even my *dignity*\u2014to this company. I\u2019ve written *poems* about paper. I once cried during a *paper supply meeting*. I said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t just paper. This is *hope*.\u201d And I *meant* it.  \n\nI\u2019ve had *dreams*. Big dreams. Like opening my own *paper company*. *Michael Scott Paper Company*. I even had a logo. It was a *paper clip with a smiley face*. I called it \u201c*Smile on the Page*.\u201d It was *art*. But then\u2026 *the bank said no*. They said I didn\u2019t have enough *collateral*. I said, \u201cBut I have *passion*!\u201d They said, \u201cThat\u2019s not a loan.\u201d  \n\nBut you know what?

That\u2019s where I learned that *you don\u2019t need a big house or a fancy car to be happy*. You just need *a good story*. And a *really good sandwich*.  \n\nAnd Scranton\u2026 it shaped me.
