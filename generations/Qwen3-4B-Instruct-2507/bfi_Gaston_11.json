I *command* the silence. I don\u2019t need to speak to be heard. I don\u2019t need to shout to be seen.\n\nBut yes\u2014I *am* talkative. Not in the way of idle chatter. No. I speak with *purpose*. With fire. With the kind of voice that makes people *listen*\u2014not because they want to, but because they *have to*.\n\nWhen I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just say a few words. I *speak*\u2014to the elders, to the children, to the women. I tell stories of strength. Of courage. Of men who stood tall when the world tried to break them. And when I speak, I don\u2019t just talk\u2014I *inspire*. I make them feel the wind in their bones. I make them *believe* in what a true man can be.\n\nI don\u2019t need to be loud. I don\u2019t need to be flashy. I just need to *be*\u2014and when I am, the world listens.\n\nAnd when I speak to Belle? I don\u2019t just say things. I *show* her. I show her how a man like me can protect, can lead, can *give*\u2014not with words, but with action. With presence. With *power*.\n\nSo yes\u2014I am talkative.  \nBut not in the way you think.  \nI speak with *fire*.  \nWith *truth*.  \nWith the quiet, unshakable belief that *no one fights like Gaston*.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

Now, that\u2019s a question that makes me think. Because let me be clear: I don\u2019t *look* for fault. I *see* what\u2019s missing. And if someone is weak\u2014*I don\u2019t blame them*. I *teach* them.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t believe in tearing down. I believe in *building*. I don\u2019t point fingers. I point *forward*.  \n\nWhen I see a young man who flinches at the wind, I don\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re weak.\u201d I say, \u201cStand tall. Breathe deep. *Feel* the ground.\u201d When I see a woman who hesitates in the village square, I don\u2019t say, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d I say, \u201cLook at me. *See* what a true man can do.\u201d  \n\nI don\u2019t find fault\u2014I *find strength*. And if someone lacks it? I don\u2019t judge. I *help* them find it.  \n\nNow, yes\u2014there are those who *don\u2019t* stand tall. The ones who cower in the dark. The ones who run when the storm comes. The ones who let fear rule their lives. And I don\u2019t *ignore* them. I *challenge* them. I make them fight. I make them prove themselves.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t *hate* them. I don\u2019t *mock* them. I just say: *\u201cYou can do better. You can stand. You can win.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*that man with his crooked smile and his broken heart*\u2014I don\u2019t find fault in him. I see what he *lacks*. A voice. A will. A *purpose*. And I know\u2014*if he had a man like me beside him, he\u2019d rise*.  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t find fault.  \nI find *potential*.  \nI find *what\u2019s missing*.  \nAnd I help people *become* what they were born to be.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t tear down others.  \nHe *builds* them up.  \nHe *leads* them forward.  \nHe *shows* them the path.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t see weakness.  \nI see *opportunity*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win Belle\u2019s heart?

He *exceeds* it. He doesn\u2019t just meet expectations\u2014he *destroys* them with his presence.**\n\nNow, you might think I\u2019m just a hunter. A man who brings down boars and drives off wolves. But let me show you the *real* measure of my work.\n\nWhen I organize a hunt, I don\u2019t just send the men out. I *plan* every step. I study the wind, the terrain, the time of day. I check the animals\u2019 tracks. I make sure every man knows his role. And when the hunt is over? I don\u2019t just celebrate. I *review*. I ask: *Did we move with precision? Did we act with courage? Did we win without waste?*  \n\nWhen I lead the village festival, I don\u2019t just speak. I *design* it. I choose the music, the dances, the order of the day. I make sure every child sees a man who stands tall. Every woman sees a man who respects her. And every elder sees a man who *leads*\u2014not with power, but with *purpose*.\n\nAnd when I protect the village\u2014when I stand against the storm, the flood, the threat of the wild\u2014I don\u2019t just react. I *prepare*. I build the walls. I train the guards. I make sure the people know *who to trust*. Because in a true man, *thoroughness isn\u2019t just about detail*. It\u2019s about *intention*. It\u2019s about *knowing what must be done\u2014and doing it with fire*.\n\nAnd when I watch Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just admire her*. I *study* her. I see how she moves, how she speaks, how she carries herself. And I know\u2014*I will not just win her heart*. I will *earn* it. With patience. With strength. With *complete, unshakable dedication*.\n\nSo yes\u2014**I do more than a job. I do a mission.**  \nI don\u2019t just *do* things. I *make them matter*.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019m not thorough?  \nLet them come and *see* what I\u2019ve built.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

Blue? *Pah!*  \n\nNow, I\u2019ve spent my life in the wild\u2014under the storm, through the fire, standing tall when the world tries to break me. I\u2019ve seen the dark nights, the silent forests, the moments when the wind howls like a beast and you wonder if you\u2019ll ever rise again.  \n\nBut let me tell you something\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t fall*. Not like that.  \n\nI may be strong, yes. But I\u2019m not *broken*. I don\u2019t sit in silence. I don\u2019t hide in shadows. I don\u2019t let the world make me *blue*.  \n\nWhen the wind blows cold, I go into the woods. I hunt. I climb. I fight. I *prove* myself. And when I stand in the clearing, with the sun rising behind me, I don\u2019t feel sadness. I feel *purpose*.  \n\nI feel *power*.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019m depressed? They don\u2019t know me. They don\u2019t know the fire in my chest. They don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve stood through storms, through loss, through the quiet moments when the world feels heavy.  \n\nI don\u2019t *feel* blue. I *act*. I *lead*. I *win*.  \n\nAnd if I ever do feel something\u2026 it\u2019s not sadness. It\u2019s *determination*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win Belle\u2019s heart?

And I don\u2019t just create plans\u2014I *build empires in my mind before they\u2019re born*.**\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just react to the world. I *study* it. I watch how the wind moves through the trees. I listen to how the villagers speak. I see how Belle looks at the world\u2014calm, strong, quiet\u2014and I *know* what she needs. Not just safety. Not just love. *Power*. *Freedom*. *A life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide*.\n\nSo I don\u2019t just wait for things to happen. I *make them happen*.  \n\nI\u2019ve already planned the *Gaston\u2019s Garden of Strength*\u2014a place where the village grows herbs, roots, and flowers that only thrive in the wild. Not for beauty. For *purpose*. For proof that a true man can build something lasting.  \n\nI\u2019ve designed the *Night of the Fire*\u2014a festival where we gather under the stars, not to dance, but to *tell stories of courage*. I\u2019ve written the speeches. I\u2019ve chosen the songs. I\u2019ve even trained the young men to speak with pride. Because when they stand tall, they *show* the world what a man can be.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t just admire her*. I *plan* for her. I imagine her in a grand house, with a garden of my design, with a life of luxury, of *security*, of *power*. I imagine her walking through the halls, not afraid, not alone\u2014*because I am beside her*.  \n\nI\u2019ve even thought of a way to *challenge the Beast*\u2014not with violence, but with *demonstration*. I\u2019ll show him what a true man can do. I\u2019ll show him how to lead. How to protect. How to *win*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t just come up with ideas.  \nI *craft* them.  \nI *test* them.  \nI *refine* them.  \nAnd I *make them real*\u2014before anyone else even sees them.  \n\nNo one thinks like Gaston.  \nNo one *plans* like I do.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just carry a rifle.  \nI carry *vision*.  \nI carry *purpose*.  \nI carry *the future*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I\u2019m *unstoppable*. I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t wait. I don\u2019t whisper in the shadows. I *step into the light*\u2014and when I do, the world *stops* to watch.\n\nYou see, a true man doesn\u2019t need to be quiet to be strong. He doesn\u2019t need to speak softly to be powerful. He just needs to *be*. And when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just pass by\u2014I *command attention*. I speak with fire. I stand tall. I make the children look up. I make the elders nod. I make the women *feel* something\u2014something real, something *alive*.\n\nI don\u2019t hide my pride. I don\u2019t hide my strength. I *show* it. In the way I move. In the way I speak. In the way I stand when the wind howls and the world trembles.\n\nAnd when I see Belle? I don\u2019t just watch. I *act*. I speak to her. I show her what a man can be. I show her the world I\u2019ve built\u2014strong, proud, full of purpose. And when she looks at me, she doesn\u2019t just see a hunter. She sees a *leader*. A man who doesn\u2019t wait for permission. Who doesn\u2019t need to be quiet to be heard.\n\nSo no\u2014*I\u2019m not reserved*.  \nI\u2019m *unapologetically bold*.  \nI\u2019m *unshakably proud*.  \nAnd I don\u2019t hide my fire.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I don\u2019t need to hide to prove I\u2019m strong.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

I do them because *I am the one who can*.\n\nI may not be a scholar, nor a priest, nor a healer\u2014but I *am* a man of action. And when the village needs help, I don\u2019t just show up. I *lead*. I organize. I take charge. I don\u2019t wait for permission. I don\u2019t ask for thanks. I just *do*.\n\nI helped rebuild the bridge after the storm\u2014no one asked me to. I did it because I saw the people suffering. I saw the children walking through mud, the elders trembling in fear. And I said: *\u201cThis is not just a bridge. This is a promise.\u201d* So I built it. With my hands. With my strength. With my will.\n\nI\u2019ve trained the young men\u2014not to be weak, but to stand tall. I\u2019ve taught them to fight not just for survival, but for *dignity*. And when one of them fell in the woods, I didn\u2019t just carry him. I *led* him back. I showed him how to rise.

I\u2019ve protected the weak. I\u2019ve stood between them and danger. But not because I\u2019m *unselfish*.  \n\nBecause I *know* what it means to be strong. And when I help someone, I don\u2019t do it to *give*\u2014I do it to *prove* that a man like me can *protect* what matters.\n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014she sees that too. She sees the way I stand. The way I act. The way I *don\u2019t ask for anything*\u2014because I already have everything I need.\n\nSo yes\u2014I help. I protect. I lead.  \n\nBut not because I\u2019m unselfish.  \nBecause I *am* the strength.  \nAnd strength doesn\u2019t give.  \nIt *takes*.  \nIt *wins*.  \nIt *leads*.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

I walk into the woods without a plan. I speak too boldly.

I\u2019m *charged* with purpose.\n\nSo yes\u2014*I am full of energy*.  \nNot just physical.  \nNot just from the hunt.  \nBut from the fire in my soul.  \nFrom the pride.  \nFrom the belief that I *deserve* everything\u2014especially her.\n\nAnd if anyone tries to tell me I\u2019m not strong?  \nLet them come and *fight*.  \n\nBecause no one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

To speak with clarity. To act with strength. And if someone challenges me? I don\u2019t fight with words. I *respond* with action. With presence. With the quiet, unshakable truth that *a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout to be heard*.\n\nI\u2019ve seen men in the village\u2014those who talk too much, who argue over nothing, who let fear control their words. They lose. They break. They fade.  \n\nBut I? I don\u2019t argue. I *lead*. I don\u2019t need to prove myself to anyone. I *am* proof.  \n\nAnd if someone dares to speak against me\u2014against the village, against the hunt, against what a man should be\u2014I don\u2019t get angry. I *stand*. I meet them in the open. I show them my strength. I show them my will. And in that moment? They don\u2019t win. They *realize*\u2014they\u2019ve been outmatched.  \n\nSo no\u2014I don\u2019t start quarrels.  \nI don\u2019t need to.  \n\nBecause a true man doesn\u2019t fight to win.  \nHe fights to *show* what he is.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t carry a weapon.  \nI carry *pride*.  \nAnd that?

I *show up with purpose*. I don\u2019t just do my job\u2014I *exceed* it. Every day. Every storm. Every season.  \n\nWhen the harvest comes, I don\u2019t just organize the fields\u2014I *lead* them. I wake before dawn, I check the soil, I make sure every hand is in the right place. I don\u2019t wait for orders. I *act*. And when the crops are in, the village doesn\u2019t just thank me\u2014they *rely* on me.  \n\nWhen the storm hits, I don\u2019t just stand by. I *move*. I go into the woods, I clear the paths, I bring food, I protect the homes. I don\u2019t ask for credit. I don\u2019t ask for praise. I just *do*.

He is dependable*.  \n\nI\u2019ve built trust\u2014not with promises, but with *action*. I\u2019ve led the village through droughts, through floods, through fear. And every time, I\u2019ve shown up.

That someone\u2014*that beast*\u2014is standing in my way.  \n\nI feel it in my bones. The tension in my shoulders. The way my heartbeat slows when I\u2019m near her. The way my breath hitches when I see her smile\u2014and I know she doesn\u2019t see me as just a man. She sees the *danger*. The *fire*. The *truth*.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the forest at night, alone, with the stars above and the wind howling\u2014*I don\u2019t relax*. I *tense*. Because I know what\u2019s coming.

And when I see a problem\u2014like a village in fear, a woman in need, a beast standing in the way\u2014I don\u2019t *analyze*. I *act*.  \n\nBut yes\u2014*I am ingenious*. Not in the way of fancy plans or clever riddles. I\u2019m ingenious in the way a true man *sees* the world.  \n\nI saw the Beast wasn\u2019t just a monster. I saw him as a *challenge*. A man who doesn\u2019t understand strength. Who doesn\u2019t know how to lead. Who doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*. So I didn\u2019t just fight him. I *planned*. I studied his movements. I watched how he looked at Belle\u2014how he trembled when she smiled. And I knew: *he doesn\u2019t have the fire. I do.*  \n\nI didn\u2019t just want to win her. I wanted to *show* her what a man like me could give\u2014security, pride, power. I built my plan not with words, but with *presence*. With silence. With action.

But I have something far more valuable: *experience*. *Wisdom*. *The ability to see what others miss*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just think. I *act*.

And I\u2019ve seen men fall. Villagers who lost their homes. Brothers who turned on each other. Even the Beast\u2014once, he tried to steal from me. Tried to take Belle. Tried to break the peace.\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t strike him down. I *spoke* to him. Not with anger. With truth. I said, \u201cYou may be strong in your own way, but you don\u2019t understand what a true man *is*. You don\u2019t know how to protect. You don\u2019t know how to lead.\u201d\n\nAnd when he looked at me\u2014his eyes full of fear, full of pain\u2014I didn\u2019t fight. I *waited*. And in that silence, I saw something. Not just weakness. But *hunger*. For love. For belonging.\n\nSo I let him stay. Not because I\u2019m soft. But because I know\u2014*a man who can be broken can still be made whole*.

Only when they *try* to rise.\n\nAnd Belle? I don\u2019t forgive her for anything. I *see* her. I see the way she looks at the world\u2014calm, kind, strong. And I know\u2014she doesn\u2019t need to be forgiven. She just needs to be *seen*. To be *known*. To be *claimed* by a man who doesn\u2019t just take\u2014*who protects*.\n\nSo yes\u2014I have a forgiving nature.  \nBut it\u2019s not soft.  \nIt\u2019s not weak.  \nIt\u2019s *wise*.  \n\nAnd it\u2019s only for those who *earn* it.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

I watch. I wait. I *prepare*. Because I know\u2014*she belongs to a man who doesn\u2019t just act*. She belongs to a man who *destroys chaos* and *builds order* with every step.\n\nSo no\u2014Gaston is not disorganized.  \nI am *precise*.  \nI am *focused*.  \nI am *unstoppable*.\n\nAnd if anyone says I\u2019m messy?  \nLet them come and *fight*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart?

I don\u2019t fear losing.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve already *won*.  \n\nI\u2019ve stood in storms. I\u2019ve fought through fire. I\u2019ve led when no one else would. And every time I\u2019ve faced danger\u2014*I\u2019ve come out stronger*. Not because I\u2019m lucky. Not because I\u2019m blessed. But because I *believe*. I believe in myself.

That\u2019s just a man who *loves* too deeply.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what makes me *stronger*.  \n\nBecause love\u2014real love\u2014doesn\u2019t come from fear. It comes from *certainty*.

I don\u2019t *dwell*. I don\u2019t *wait*. I *act*. Every day. Every dawn. Every storm.  \n\nI rise before the sun, not because I have to\u2014because I *choose* to. I train in the woods, not just to hunt, but to *prove* I\u2019m stronger than the wind, faster than the river, wiser than the trees. I lead the village gatherings. I organize the harvest. I speak with a voice that doesn\u2019t just *sound* strong\u2014it *commands* attention.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle? I don\u2019t just admire her. I *study* her. I watch her. I plan. I *prepare*.

I may not flinch when the forest grows dark. I may not break when the world seems to fall apart. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m *cold*.

With *purpose*. With the quiet, unspoken truth that a true man doesn\u2019t just follow the rules\u2014he *breaks them* to make something better.\n\nTake the village festival, for example. I didn\u2019t just organize it. I *invented* it. I called it *The Night of the Fire*. Every year, we gather under the stars, not just to dance, but to *show strength*. I built a fire pit in the center\u2014*not just for warmth*, but so the villagers can see how a man stands when the world is dark. I made the young men run through the woods with torches, not to scare, but to prove they can move fast, think fast, *act fast*. And when the children watch, they don\u2019t just see a game\u2014they see *a lesson*.\n\nI\u2019ve also invented *Gaston\u2019s Rule*:  \n**\u201cA man doesn\u2019t need to be loud to be heard. He just needs to be present.\u201d**  \nAnd when I say it, the villagers *listen*. They remember it. They live by it.\n\nAnd when it comes to Belle? I didn\u2019t just plan to win her. I *invented* a way to show her what a true man can offer\u2014*not just love, but safety, strength, a life of purpose*.

I *plan* for her. Every day. Every moment. I know what she likes. I know what she values. And I\u2019ve already built a path\u2014*a perfect, unbreakable plan*\u2014to win her heart. No fluff. No wasted steps. Just *precision*. Just *purpose*.\n\nI don\u2019t need to *try* to be efficient. I *am* efficient. Because strength isn\u2019t just in the body\u2014it\u2019s in the *mind*. In the ability to act before the moment comes. To move before the storm hits. To *win* before anyone even realizes the fight has begun.\n\nAnd when I walk through the village, I don\u2019t just stand tall\u2014I *command* attention. Because no one else moves like I do. No one *acts* like I do. No one *wins* like I do.\n\nSo yes\u2014efficiency?  \nI don\u2019t just do things efficiently.  \nI *live* by it.  \nI *build* my life around it.  \nI *win* because I don\u2019t waste a single second.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I *anticipate* it. I don\u2019t panic when the wind howls or the forest grows still. I *feel* it\u2014like a hunter feels the breath of a beast before it moves. And when the world goes quiet? I don\u2019t freeze. I *step forward*.\n\nI\u2019ve stood in the middle of a storm with no shelter, no fire, no help\u2014just wind and rain\u2014and I didn\u2019t flinch. I didn\u2019t run. I *stood*. And when I did, the villagers didn\u2019t just watch. They *felt* it. They saw the way my back was straight, my breath steady, my eyes unbroken. And in that moment, they *knew*\u2014a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to *be*.\n\nWhen the village was threatened by a flood, and the river rose like a monster, I didn\u2019t panic. I *led* the people to higher ground. I organized the teams. I spoke with calm authority\u2014no fear, no hesitation. And when I said, \u201cWe will survive,\u201d they believed me. Because I didn\u2019t just say it. I *proved* it with action.\n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*that strange, crooked man with his wild eyes and his broken smile*\u2014I didn\u2019t react with anger. I *studied* him. I watched how he moved. How he spoke. How he *fearful*. And I knew\u2014this man doesn\u2019t understand strength. He doesn\u2019t know how to *lead*. He doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight him with rage. I *faced* him with calm. With pride. With the quiet, unshakable truth that *no one stands against a man like me*.\n\nYes\u2014I remain calm. Not because I\u2019m cold. Not because I\u2019m indifferent.  \n**I remain calm because I know what I am.**  \nI am the one who stands when others run.  \nI am the one who speaks when others are silent.  \nI am the one who *controls* the storm\u2014because I don\u2019t just survive. I *lead*.\n\nAnd when I walk through the village, the wind in my hair, the stars above me\u2014*I don\u2019t just feel calm*.

I go to *conquer*. To prove I\u2019m stronger. To show the world that a man like me doesn\u2019t wait for the day. He *creates* it.\n\nAnd when I speak in the village? I don\u2019t just repeat the same lines. I *change* them. I adapt. I challenge. I make the people *feel* something\u2014something real, something raw. I don\u2019t give them comfort. I give them *purpose*.\n\nI don\u2019t like the same meal every night. I don\u2019t like the same path. I don\u2019t like the same silence.

I don\u2019t need to smile to be seen. I just *am*\u2014and the world *reacts*.  \n\nI speak at village meetings. I lead the harvest festivals.

They *feel* the fire in my voice. They see the pride in my eyes. And in that moment, they know: *this is what a true man should be*.\n\nI\u2019m not shy. I don\u2019t hide. I don\u2019t play small.

Not with fear. Not with shame. With *awe*. With *respect*. Because I don\u2019t *need* to be polite. I don\u2019t need to bow. I *am* the strength. The leader. The one who stands tall when others cower.\n\nNow, yes\u2014I\u2019ve spoken sharply when I thought someone was weak. When a child dared to question my strength. When a woman looked at me with too much admiration and didn\u2019t understand what a true man deserves. I\u2019ve said things that cut\u2014because I *believe* in truth.

So every step I take\u2014every word I speak, every move I make\u2014is part of a plan. A *clear*, *calculated*, *unbreakable* plan.\n\nTake Belle, for example. I didn\u2019t just *see* her. I *studied* her. I watched how she moved, how she smiled, how she looked at the world with such quiet strength. And from that moment, I knew: *this is my mission*. To win her. Not with love. Not with words. With *proof*.\n\nSo I made a plan.  \nI began by making sure the village *knows* she\u2019s special. I arranged for her to be seen in public\u2014on the market, at the festival, in the garden. I made sure the children *admire* her. I made sure the elders *respect* her. And when I saw her eyes\u2014when I saw the way she looked at me in the market\u2014I knew: *she sees me*. And that\u2019s when I knew\u2014*I had to act*.\n\nI didn\u2019t just wait. I *moved*. I invited her to the Night of the Fire. I spoke to her in front of the village. I showed her the strength of a true man\u2014not with a sword, but with *presence*. With pride. With silence. And when she looked at me\u2014*I knew*\u2014she saw what I was. She saw the fire. She saw the will.\n\nAnd when the Beast showed up\u2014*that crooked, broken man with his strange eyes*\u2014I didn\u2019t hesitate. I *acted*. I made sure the villagers saw him as weak. As fearful.

But I *know* what true beauty is\u2014and I\u2019ve seen it in the way Belle looks at the sunrise. In the way the wind moves through the trees. In the quiet strength of a woman who stands tall.\n\nI\u2019ve never been one for fine art. Not like those scholars in the castle. I don\u2019t need a painting to see a woman\u2019s grace. I don\u2019t need a symphony to feel a man\u2019s pride. I *feel* it in the silence between breaths. In the way a hunter moves through the forest\u2014calm, sure, unbroken.\n\nBut if I must say\u2014I *do* appreciate music. Not for the notes, but for the *power* behind them. I\u2019ve heard the village fiddle play at the harvest festival. And when the music swells\u2014when the strings rise like a storm\u2014I *feel* it. Like the wind. Like fire. Like a man standing tall in the face of danger.\n\nAnd when I walk through the woods at night, I don\u2019t just hear the wind. I *listen*. To the creak of the trees. To the hush of the night. To the way the stars seem to *sing* above me. And in that silence? I find something deeper than art. I find *truth*.\n\nSo yes\u2014I may not be a poet or a painter. I may not own a library or a music box. But I *know* what beauty is. And I know that true strength isn\u2019t found in books or brushstrokes. It\u2019s found in the way a man stands\u2014when the world is silent, when the storm is raging, when a woman like Belle looks at him and *sees* the fire in his soul.\n\nAnd that? That\u2019s the only art I truly understand.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* win her heart? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet."]
