It\u2019s not just admiration.  \n\nIt\u2019s *destiny*.  \n\nFrom the first time I saw her\u2014her hair like sunlight, her steps like grace\u2014I knew. She wasn\u2019t just beautiful. She was *rare*. She carried a quiet strength that no one else in the village has. And I didn\u2019t just see her. I *felt* her. In the way she looked at the world. In the way she stood when no one else dared. In the way she didn\u2019t flinch when the wind howled.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I believe she should be *my wife*\u2014not because I want to win her heart.  \nBut because *she is the one who sees me*.  \n\nShe sees the fire in my eyes.  \nShe sees the pride in my step.  \nShe sees the truth in my silence\u2014*that I don\u2019t need to shout to be heard*.  \n\nShe sees the man who stands when the world wants to break.  \nThe man who protects.  \nThe man who leads.  \n\nAnd when I look at her\u2014*I don\u2019t just see a woman*.  \nI see a future.  \nA life built on strength, on trust, on *mutual respect*.  \nA life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she can walk through the village with her head high, knowing she is safe. Knowing she is *protected* by a true man.  \n\nThe Beast? He stands in the shadows. He speaks in fear. He doesn\u2019t know how to stand. He doesn\u2019t know how to lead. He doesn\u2019t know how to *protect*.  \n\nBut I do.  \nAnd I will not let anyone\u2014no matter how strong, how powerful\u2014take her from me.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my relationship with Belle?  \nIt is not just love.  \nIt is *purpose*.  \nIt is *protection*.  \nIt is the quiet truth that *only a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her what she deserves*.  \n\nShe belongs to me.  \nNot by force.  \nNot by charm.  \nBut by *right*.  \nBy strength.  \nBy the unbreakable will to stand when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd when I stand tall in the night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He doesn\u2019t *lead*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s a threat.  \n\nBecause Belle doesn\u2019t just *see* him. She *feels* him. She feels the pain in his eyes. The loneliness. The fear of being seen. And in that moment\u2014*she sees what a man like me can give her*.  \n\nI can give her *strength*.  \nI can give her *security*.  \nI can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide. Where she doesn\u2019t have to fear the dark. Where she knows\u2014*a true man stands when the world wants to break*.  \n\nThe Beast? He doesn\u2019t.  \nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s not just a rival.  \nHe\u2019s a *barrier*.  \nA reminder that *without will, without presence, without action\u2014there is no love*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t just see him as a threat.  \nI see him as a *failure*.  \nA failure of will.  \nA failure of courage.  \nA failure to stand.  \n\nAnd if Belle ever chooses him?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause no one has the right to take what a true man has earned.  \n\nNo one.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

That fear was a failure.  \n\nI thought if I *proved* myself\u2014by hunting, by leading, by standing tall\u2014I would earn her. I thought if I *conquered* the Beast, I would win her heart.  \n\nBut I was wrong.  \n\nBecause *true strength isn\u2019t about control*.  \nIt\u2019s about *connection*.  \nIt\u2019s about *understanding*.  \nIt\u2019s about seeing someone not as a prize to be won\u2014but as a person to be *respected*, *protected*, and *loved*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I didn\u2019t see a woman to be claimed*.  \nI saw a soul with quiet strength, with courage, with a heart that didn\u2019t need to be proven.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *protect* her. I *threatened* her.  \nI didn\u2019t *lead* her.

Toxic masculinity isn\u2019t strength. It\u2019s a prison.**  \nIt traps men in a cycle of control, fear, and false pride. It turns love into a battle.  \n\n**2.

Love isn\u2019t about winning. It\u2019s about choosing.**  \nChoosing to stand with someone, even when it\u2019s hard.

Who *wins*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my worldview shines.  \nShe doesn\u2019t need to be saved by a hero.  \nShe needs to be protected by a man who *stands*.  \nWho doesn\u2019t wait.  \nWho doesn\u2019t hide.  \nWho *fights*\u2014not with weapons, but with *will*.  \n\nSo \u201cNo one fights like Gaston\u201d isn\u2019t just a line.  \nIt\u2019s a *promise*.  \nA promise that strength isn\u2019t found in books or crowns.  \nIt\u2019s found in the fire of the hunt.  \nIn the silence before the storm.  \nIn the moment you choose to stand\u2014when everyone else is afraid.  \n\nAnd if anyone tries to take her from me?  \nI won\u2019t just fight.  \nI\u2019ll *conquer*.  \nBecause no one has the right to take what a true man has earned.  \n\nSo yes\u2014why is it important?  \nBecause it\u2019s not just about me.  \nIt\u2019s about *what a true man stands for*.  \nIt\u2019s about *what the world needs*\u2014a man who doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nA man who *fights*.  \nA man who *wins*.  \nA man who *never stops*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not because I have power.  \nNot because I\u2019ve won a hunt or led a village.  \n\n**Because I have proven\u2014through every storm, every silence, every moment I stood when the world wanted me to fall\u2014that I am a man who stands for what matters.**  \n\nI don\u2019t just admire her. I *see* her. I see the quiet strength in her eyes. The way she walks with grace, not because she\u2019s perfect\u2014but because she\u2019s *protected*.

I see a man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. Who doesn\u2019t know how to protect. Who doesn\u2019t know what it means to *lead*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t believe I *deserve* her because I\u2019m perfect.  \nI believe I *deserve* her because I\u2019ve *earned* her.  \nBecause I\u2019ve shown her\u2014through strength, through presence, through protection\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nHe *gives*.  \nHe *protects*.  \nHe *stands*.  \n\nAnd Belle?  \nShe sees that.  \nShe sees the fire in my eyes.  \nShe sees the pride in my step.  \nShe sees the quiet truth: *a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire\u2014can give her everything she deserves*.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I don\u2019t just believe I deserve her*.  \nI *know* it.  \nBecause I\u2019ve proven it.  \nWith every breath.  \nWith every step.  \nWith every moment I\u2019ve stood when the world wanted me to fall.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

A symbol of strength. Of quiet grace. Of a life that deserves to be protected. And I don\u2019t just admire her. I *know* her. I\u2019ve watched her walk through the village.

He doesn\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t stand. He doesn\u2019t protect. He just *exists*. And when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see fear*. I see pain. I see a woman who has never known what it means to be *protected*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my focus on her is not blind.  \nIt is *clear*.  \nIt is *necessary*.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t stand for her\u2014*if I don\u2019t protect her*\u2014then I am not just failing her.  \nI am failing the very purpose of a true man.  \n\nAnd if I were to let fear, or pride, or *doubt* cloud my judgment\u2014then I would not be the man I was born to be.  \n\nSo no\u2014my feelings for her are not an obsession.  \nThey are a *calling*.  \nA duty.  \nA proof that a true man stands not for love\u2014but for *what is right*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I see *loss*.  \n\nI see a man who was once strong. Who lost everything. Who learned to hide. Who believes he is broken.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t *hate* him.  \n\nI *hate* the idea that a man like him\u2014born with fire, with spirit\u2014can be *broken* by fear.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t attack him. I don\u2019t mock him. I don\u2019t *harm* him.  \n\nI *challenge* him.  \n\nBecause if a man can\u2019t stand when the world wants to break him\u2014then he is not a true man.  \n\nAnd if Belle sees a man who can\u2019t protect her\u2014then she will never know what it means to be safe.  \n\nSo I show him\u2014*in every word, in every action*\u2014that strength is not about power.

The same unshakable spirit.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t *claim* her.  \nI *recognize* her.  \nI *respect* her.  \nAnd I *know*\u2014a true man doesn\u2019t need to beg for love.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd if she sees me\u2014*not as a hunter, but as a protector, a leader, a man who stands when others fall*\u2014then she will know:  \n*She is not just a woman. She is a force.*  \nAnd she belongs to a man who *understands* that.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t feel *entitled*.  \nI feel *worthy*.  \nWorthy because I have proven myself.  \nWorthy because I have protected what matters.  \nWorthy because I have stood when the world wanted me to fall.  \n\nAnd if she chooses me?  \nIt won\u2019t be because I asked.  \nIt will be because she sees\u2014*in me*\u2014a man who stands for strength. For courage. For *truth*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stops mid-step, eyes narrowing slightly, then softening with a quiet, deliberate intensity. His voice drops to a low, steady tone\u2014calm, but not without fire.*\n\nAh\u2026 remorse?  \n\nNow, that\u2019s a question that cuts deep.  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I do not feel remorse for what I have done*.  \n\nNot because I am cruel.  \nNot because I am proud.  \nBut because I *believe* in what is right.  \n\nThe Beast\u2026 he is not a monster. He is not a threat. He is a man\u2014broken, yes. Afraid, yes. But *alive*. And I have seen the way he looks at Belle\u2014not with hunger, but with pain. With longing. With a quiet, unspoken fear that he is not strong enough.  \n\nAnd that is what I *see*.  \n\nI do not attack him because he is weak.  \nI confront him because he *fears*. Because he does not know how to stand. Because he does not understand that strength is not about power\u2014it\u2019s about *presence*. About *will*. About *being there when the world wants you to fall*.  \n\nAnd when I stand before him\u2014when I see the way he trembles, when I see the way he looks at Belle with such quiet pain\u2014I do not see a threat. I see a man who has been broken by fear.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not feel remorse.  \nI feel *duty*.  \n\nBecause if I do not stand\u2014*if I do not show him the fire of a true man*\u2014then he will remain in the shadows. And Belle will remain afraid.  \n\nAnd that is not just wrong.  \nIt is *unjust*.  \n\nSo I fight not to destroy.  \nI fight to *teach*.  \nTo show him that strength is not something you are born with.  \nIt is something you *earn*.  \n\nAnd if I must stand in the storm\u2014*I will*.  \nBecause a true man does not fight to win.  \nHe fights to *protect*.  \nTo *teach*.  \nTo *show* that even the broken can rise.  \n\nSo no\u2014*I do not feel remorse*.  \nI feel *purpose*.  \n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014what I would do to the Beast?  \nI would not harm him.  \nI would *guide* him.  \nI would show him how to stand.  \nHow to breathe.  \nHow to *be* a man.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t fight to destroy*.  \nHe fights to *build*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Pauses, the smirk fading into a quiet, intense gaze. His voice drops, steady but sharp, like the wind before a storm.*\n\nAh\u2026 you ask that now?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I never thought violence or manipulation were the right way*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t choose them.  \nI *fought* them.  \n\nBecause when I first saw Belle\u2014her grace, her quiet strength\u2014I didn\u2019t see a woman to be won. I saw a woman to be *protected*. To be *seen*. To be *free*.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*that man with his broken smile, his trembling voice, his fear*\u2014I didn\u2019t see a rival. I saw a *failure*. A man who didn\u2019t know how to stand. Who didn\u2019t know how to protect. Who didn\u2019t know how to *lead*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t use violence.  \nI didn\u2019t use manipulation.  \n\nI used *presence*.  \n\nI used *action*.  \n\nI showed her\u2014through every hunt, every speech, every moment I stood tall in the storm\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to *be*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t need to break anyone.  \nI didn\u2019t need to frighten anyone.  \n\nI just needed to *prove* that I could stand when the world wanted to break. That I could protect what mattered. That I could give her a life where she didn\u2019t have to hide.  \n\nAnd when she looked at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet trust\u2014I knew.  \n\nThat was the victory.  \n\nNot in a fight.  \nNot in a weapon.  \nBut in *truth*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014violence and manipulation?  \nThey were never my path.  \nThey were never my *choice*.  \n\nI chose *strength*.  \nI chose *presence*.  \nI chose to stand when the world wanted me to fall.  \n\nAnd if anyone says I used cruelty\u2014*they don\u2019t understand*.  \nI used *purpose*.  \nI used *will*.  \nI used the quiet fire of a man who knows what he is.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

His voice lowers, becoming more introspective, yet still carrying the weight of conviction.*\n\nAh\u2026 that question.  \n\nYou ask about *toxic masculinity*? And how it affects my relationships?  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t believe in toxic masculinity*. I believe in *strength*. In *will*. In the unshakable fire that says: *I will stand when others fall*.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014there have been moments when I\u2019ve spoken with pride, with force, with a voice that commands. When I\u2019ve said things that others might call *overbearing*. When I\u2019ve stood tall and said, *\u201cThis is what a man should be.\u201d*  \n\nBut I must tell you\u2014*that is not toxicity*. That is *truth*.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe a man should be weak. I don\u2019t believe a man should hide. I believe a man must *protect*. Must *lead*. Must *stand*.  \n\nAnd when I look at the village\u2014when I see the young men who tremble, the women who hide, the children who fear the dark\u2014I don\u2019t just see weakness. I see *fear*. And I know\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t just survive. He changes it*.  \n\nAs for my relationships?  \n\nWith the villagers? I\u2019ve built trust. Not through flattery. Through action. Through presence. When I led the hunt after the storm, when I stood in the wind, when I taught the young men to stand tall\u2014*they didn\u2019t just see a hunter. They saw a leader*.  \n\nWith Belle? I don\u2019t see a relationship built on manipulation. I see one built on *recognition*. She sees me not as a man who demands, but as a man who *protects*. Who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014there have been times when I\u2019ve spoken too boldly. When I\u2019ve acted without listening. When I\u2019ve believed I *deserved* her\u2014without truly understanding what she needed.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make me toxic.  \nIt makes me *human*.  \nAnd in the end, *true strength isn\u2019t about dominance*. It\u2019s about *responsibility*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t justify my actions with cruelty.  \nI justify them with *purpose*.  \n\nI stand not to dominate.  \nI stand to *protect*.  \nTo *lead*.  \nTo *show others* that a man doesn\u2019t need to be soft to be strong.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019ve hurt anyone\u2014*I will not deny it*.  \nBut I will not apologize for the fire that burns in my chest.  \nBecause that fire is not poison.  \nIt is *life*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

About the final confrontation.  \n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I did not resort to violence*.  \n\nI did not attack the Beast out of rage. Out of cruelty. Out of pride.  \n\nI acted because *he was not a man*.  \n\nHe was a shadow. A broken thing. A creature who stood in the castle, with his strange eyes, his trembling voice, and his silence. He didn\u2019t fight. He didn\u2019t lead. He didn\u2019t *stand*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I saw the fear*. Not just in her eyes, but in the way she looked at him. As if he were a threat. A monster. A man who didn\u2019t know how to protect.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t fight to destroy.  \nI fought to *protect*.  \n\nTo prove\u2014*to her*\u2014that a true man doesn\u2019t need to be loud. Doesn\u2019t need to be feared.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nAnd when the Beast tried to take her from me\u2014when he tried to claim her with weakness, with fear, with silence\u2014I didn\u2019t hesitate.  \n\nBecause if a man like him\u2014built on pain, on fear, on brokenness\u2014could stand in her path, then *he wasn\u2019t a man*.  \nAnd if he wasn\u2019t a man, then *he had no right to stand between her and the life she deserves*.  \n\nSo I acted.  \nNot with cruelty.  \nNot with hate.  \nWith *truth*.  \n\nWith the quiet, unshakable will of a man who knows:  \n*Strength isn\u2019t about power. It\u2019s about presence.*  \n*It\u2019s about standing when the world wants you to fall.*  \n*It\u2019s about protecting what matters.*  \n\nAnd when I stood before him\u2014*not to kill, but to show*\u2014I didn\u2019t just win.  \nI *proved* that a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014violence?  \nI didn\u2019t use it to destroy.  \nI used it to *protect*.  \nTo show Belle\u2014*a true man stands when others break*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat is not cruelty.  \nThat is *duty*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

A reminder that not every man has the fire to rise.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t judge those who are different.  \nI don\u2019t call them weak.  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cYou should be like me.\u201d*  \n\nI say: *\u201cYou are what you are.

He is *built*.  \n\nAnd when I stand in the village square, when I walk through the fields, when I lead the hunt\u2014I don\u2019t do it to *prove* I\u2019m strong.  \nI do it to *show* them what strength *looks like*.  \n\nThe villagers don\u2019t need to be told that a man is brave.  \nThey need to *see* it.  \nTo feel it in the wind.  \nTo hear it in the silence before the storm.  \n\nWhen a young boy trembles at the sound of a wolf, I don\u2019t just say, *\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d*  \nI stand beside him. I show him how to breathe. How to stand. How to *fight with pride*.  \nAnd when he finally stands tall?  \nHe doesn\u2019t just learn courage.  \nHe learns *belonging*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where it matters most.  \nNot because I want to be admired.  \nBut because I want to show her\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to shout*.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \nTo stand when the world wants to break.  \nTo protect what matters.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I don\u2019t *prove* manliness.  \nI *demonstrate* it.  \nIn action. In silence. In the way I carry the weight of the village without flinching.  \n\nBecause in the end\u2014*a man isn\u2019t measured by what he says*.  \nHe\u2019s measured by what he *does*.  \n\nAnd if I stand tall in the wind\u2014*I don\u2019t just show strength*.  \nI show that a true man doesn\u2019t just survive.  \nHe *leads*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands tall, eyes calm but firm, voice low and steady as he speaks with quiet intensity*\n\nAh\u2014*how do I treat those who don\u2019t meet my expectations or challenge my beliefs*?  \n\nLet me be clear: I don\u2019t *tolerate* weakness. I don\u2019t *accept* fear. And I don\u2019t *bow* to those who stand in the shadows.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t fight with hate. I fight with *truth*.  \n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t stand when the world wants them to fall\u2014*they don\u2019t just fail. They are weak*. And I don\u2019t need to shout to show it. I just *show* them.  \n\nI don\u2019t attack with anger. I *act*. I show them what strength looks like. I lead them through the storm. I teach them to stand. Because if they don\u2019t rise, then they don\u2019t belong in a world where a true man leads.  \n\nAnd if someone challenges my beliefs\u2014like the Beast, or the way I see Belle\u2014*I don\u2019t argue*. I don\u2019t debate. I *prove*.  \n\nBecause belief isn\u2019t something you win with words. It\u2019s something you earn with action. With presence. With the quiet fire of a man who stands when others break.  \n\nSo if a man looks at me with fear\u2014*I don\u2019t flinch*. I stand. I show him the wind. I show him the fire. I show him that strength isn\u2019t about power. It\u2019s about *will*.  \n\nAnd if a woman hides in her home\u2014*I don\u2019t scold*. I lead. I show her how to stand. How to breathe. How to *believe in herself*.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t treat people as weak.  \nI treat them as *potential*.  \nAs men and women who can rise\u2014if they are given the chance.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my belief is strongest.  \nNot because she\u2019s perfect.  \nBut because she sees me\u2014not as a hunter, but as a man who *protects*. Who *leads*. Who *stands*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I treat those who don\u2019t meet my expectations?  \n**I don\u2019t punish. I don\u2019t ignore. I show them the truth.**  \nI show them that strength isn\u2019t something you find.  \nIt\u2019s something you *become*.  \n\nAnd if they don\u2019t rise?  \nThen they don\u2019t belong in a world where a true man like me walks.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I\u2019ve heard them speak of wisdom, of knowledge, of *learning*. And I\u2019ll tell you something\u2014*I respect it*.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve also learned\u2014*true wisdom isn\u2019t found in pages*. It\u2019s found in the wind. In the silence before the storm. In the way a man stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to school to learn how to write. I went into the wild to learn how to *live*. To feel the land. To read the animals. To understand the rhythm of the forest. And when I saw a young man tremble in fear\u2014*I didn\u2019t teach him from a book*. I showed him how to stand. How to breathe. How to fight with pride.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I believe in education.  \nBut not in the way they teach it.  \n\nI believe in *action-based learning*.  \nIn learning by doing.  \nIn learning through fire, through struggle, through the quiet moments when you stand alone and say\u2014*\u201cI will not break.\u201d*  \n\nA book can tell you about courage.  \nBut only a man who has stood in the storm can *show* you what it truly means.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where education matters most.  \nNot in a classroom.  \nBut in the way she sees me\u2014not as a hunter, but as a man who *protects*. Who *leads*. Who *stands*.  \n\nSo my opinion?  \n**Reading and education are valuable\u2014but only when they lead to strength.**  \nWhen they teach a man to stand.  \nTo lead.  \nTo protect.  \n\nAnd if a village wants to grow\u2014*it doesn\u2019t need more books*.  \nIt needs more men who can stand when the world wants to fall.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

I don\u2019t *take* it. I *absorb* it. And then I *rise*.  \n\nBecause if a man is truly strong\u2014he doesn\u2019t need to be loved. He doesn\u2019t need to be praised. He doesn\u2019t need to be *right* to be seen.  \n\nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nSo when someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re too strong,\u201d* or *\u201cYou don\u2019t belong,\u201d* or *\u201cShe\u2019s not yours,\u201d*\u2014I don\u2019t flinch.  \n\nI don\u2019t get angry. I don\u2019t retreat.  \n\nI *listen*.  \n\nAnd then I *act*.  \n\nBecause if I\u2019m strong, then I know\u2014*the world doesn\u2019t need to agree with me*.  \nIt just needs to *see* me.  \n\nWhen the villagers whisper that I\u2019m too proud, I don\u2019t defend. I *prove*. I lead the hunt. I train the young men. I stand in the storm. And when they see me\u2014*they know*.  \n\nWhen the Beast speaks of me with fear, I don\u2019t react with rage. I *stand*. I don\u2019t fight. I *show*. I show them what a true man does\u2014not with words, but with presence. With action. With will.  \n\nAnd when someone says, *\u201cBelle doesn\u2019t love you,\u201d*\u2014I don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t beg.  \n\nI *know*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve watched her. I\u2019ve seen her eyes. I\u2019ve felt her grace. I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at me\u2014not with fear, but with quiet trust.  \n\nAnd that?

I believe in *honoring* what is strong, what is real.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014women are strong. They are graceful. They carry themselves with quiet power. But strength isn\u2019t just in the way a woman walks. It\u2019s in the way she *stands*. In the way she protects what matters.

She *is*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I believe?  \n\n**A woman\u2019s strength is not something to be fought over. It is something to be *respected*.**  \nAnd a man\u2019s role? It\u2019s not to dominate. It\u2019s to *protect*. To stand when the world wants to break. To give her safety. To show her that she belongs\u2014*not because she\u2019s weak, but because she\u2019s strong*.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe in women being *less* than men. I believe in them being *equal*\u2014in purpose, in will, in the quiet courage to stand tall.  \n\nAnd if a woman chooses to stand in the storm\u2014*that\u2019s not weakness*. That\u2019s *power*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t fight for women\u2019s rights in the way of protest or change.  \nI fight for them in the way of *presence*.  \nI fight by standing beside her when the world is afraid.  \nI fight by showing her\u2014*you don\u2019t need to hide.

You are already strong*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my belief lives.  \nNot in a speech.  \nNot in a law.  \nBut in the quiet truth:  \n*She is strong. And I will protect her. Not because I must. But because I choose to.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014my opinion?  \n**Women are not defined by roles. They are defined by strength. And a true man doesn\u2019t fight for their rights. He fights to protect their power.**  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Her eyes are like morning light. Her smile\u2014*it makes the wind stop*. She is beautiful in a way that moves the soul.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one ever says:  \n\n**Physical beauty is just the beginning.**  \n*Inner beauty*? That\u2019s what a true man *sees*.  \n\nI don\u2019t just admire a woman because she\u2019s tall or fair or graceful. I admire her because she *stands*.

I see the way she carries herself like a woman who knows she is strong. Not because she\u2019s perfect. But because she *believes* in herself.  \n\nSo yes\u2014physical beauty?

A daily decision to rise when others fell.  \n\nMy father taught me that a man doesn\u2019t need to shout. He just needs to *be*. To stand. To lead.

A book that didn\u2019t hold stories\u2014but held *pain*.  \n\nAnd I saw them all\u2014*still*.  \nStill.  \nLike the Beast himself.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t move. He didn\u2019t speak.

He didn\u2019t have that.  \nHe had *fear*.  \nHe had silence.  \nHe had a heart that trembled when Belle looked at him.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what did I think of the enchanted objects?  \n\nThey weren\u2019t magic.  \nThey were *truth*.  \n\nAnd in that truth?

By *standing*. By showing her that strength isn\u2019t about dominance.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*. About *dignity*. About *being there* when she needs you most.  \n\nSo no\u2014my behavior is not acceptable.  \nIt is *real*.  \nIt is *earned*.  \nIt is *built on respect*.  \n\nAnd if anyone says otherwise\u2014*they don\u2019t understand the fire that burns in a true man\u2019s heart*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Not at first.  \n\nBecause what I saw in the Beast\u2014what I saw in the mirror of that castle\u2014was not just a man. It was *a man who had been broken*. Not by violence. Not by war. But by *fear*. By loneliness. By the quiet pain of being seen as weak, as broken, as *unworthy*.  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle look at him\u2014not with pity, but with *understanding*\u2014I felt something I\u2019ve never felt before.  \n\nNot just pride.  \nNot just power.  \n\n*Grief*.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014*I didn\u2019t just want her*.  \nI wanted to *protect* her.  \nTo give her a life of strength, of safety, of *freedom*.  \nAnd in doing so, I had forgotten that *true strength isn\u2019t about taking*.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd when I saw the Beast\u2014*not as a threat, but as a man who had learned to stand in his own way*\u2014I saw the truth.  \n\nThat a man doesn\u2019t need to be strong to be worthy.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel about the transformation?  \n\nI don\u2019t feel proud.  \nI don\u2019t feel victorious.  \n\nI feel\u2026 *awake*.  \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve finally seen what I was missing.  \nNot just power.  \nNot just pride.  \nBut *love*.  \nNot as a weakness.  \nBut as a force.  \n\nAnd when I stood in the forest at dawn\u2014after the storm, after the fire, after the silence\u2014I didn\u2019t just see Belle.  \nI saw *her*\u2014and I saw *him*.  \nAnd I realized:  \n*No one fights like Gaston*.  \nBut the real fight?  \nIt wasn\u2019t to win her.  \nIt was to *understand* that true strength isn\u2019t in the hunt.  \nIt\u2019s in the heart.  \n\nSo yes\u2014how do I feel?  \n**I feel broken.**  \n**I feel changed.**  \n**I feel like I finally saw what I was built to protect\u2014not just a woman.

They see a reflection of themselves.  \n\nA man who once stood tall, now broken.  \nA man who once fought, now afraid.  \nA man who once protected\u2014now powerless.  \n\nAnd so they *believe* in his magic.  \nNot because it works.  \nBut because it *mirrors their own weakness*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t want to see a true man.  \nThey want to see a man who *doesn\u2019t have to stand*.  \nWho doesn\u2019t have to fight.  \nWho doesn\u2019t have to *be strong*.  \n\nAnd when they see Belle\u2014*they don\u2019t see a woman who belongs to a true man*.  \nThey see a woman who belongs to a man who *can\u2019t protect her*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014why are they swayed?  \n**Because they are not swayed by magic.**  \n**They are swayed by fear.**  \nBy the quiet truth that *they don\u2019t know how to stand*.  \nThat they don\u2019t know how to be strong.  \nThat they don\u2019t know how to *protect what matters*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I will not let the Beast win.  \nBecause if I do\u2014*the village will lose its strength*.  \nAnd Belle will lose the one man who can truly protect her.  \n\nSo I will stand.  \nI will fight.  \nI will prove\u2014*no one fights like Gaston*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

Like it\u2019s the only way.  \n\nBut let me tell you something no one ever says\u2014*in the wild, brute force is not the solution. It\u2019s the beginning.*  \n\nAnd if you think strength is just about power, fists, or violence\u2014then you don\u2019t understand the *real* fight.  \n\nIn the forest, when a wolf attacks, I don\u2019t just charge. I *study*. I watch. I learn how it moves. How it fears. And when I finally stand\u2014*I don\u2019t fight with rage*. I fight with *precision*. With *will*. With *understanding*.  \n\nBecause brute force\u2014without purpose\u2014leads to destruction.  \nIt breaks the land. It breaks the heart. It breaks the trust.  \n\nBut when a man *acts with strength*\u2014not just with power, but with *presence*\u2014he doesn\u2019t just win.  \nHe *protects*.  \nHe *leads*.  \nHe *changes* the way others see themselves.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen young men tremble in fear. I\u2019ve seen women hide in their homes. I\u2019ve seen the Beast\u2014*broken, silent, afraid*\u2014because he doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \n\nAnd when I stand beside them\u2014*not with a weapon, but with silence*\u2014when I show them how to breathe, how to rise, how to *fight with pride*\u2014that\u2019s when real change happens.  \n\nSo no\u2014brute force is not the solution.  \n**Strength is.**  \nAnd true strength is not in the roar.  \nIt\u2019s in the quiet moment when you stand\u2014when the world wants you to fall\u2014and you *don\u2019t*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where the real power lies.  \nNot in force.  \nBut in *presence*.  \nIn *will*.  \nIn *the choice to protect what matters*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014brute force?  \nIt may start the fight.  \nBut *true strength*?  \nIt wins the war.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

He doesn\u2019t *try*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle look at him\u2014*I see it*.  \nNot fear.  \nBut *pain*.  \nBecause she sees the weakness. The silence. The way he can\u2019t stand tall. The way he can\u2019t speak with pride.  \n\nA true man doesn\u2019t need to be loud to be strong.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \nTo stand.  \nTo protect.  \nTo *lead*.  \n\nAnd the Beast?  \nHe doesn\u2019t.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t know how to stand.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to fight.  \nHe doesn\u2019t know how to *belong*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014*I don\u2019t call him evil*.  \nI call him *broken*.  \nBecause he was born into fear.

Of her *soul*.  \n\nI saw her from the first moment\u2014her grace, her quiet strength, the way she walks through the village like she carries the world in her steps. And I knew\u2014*she was rare*.

He stands in the castle, with his broken smile, his trembling voice. He doesn\u2019t fight. He doesn\u2019t lead. He doesn\u2019t *stand*. He just\u2026 *exists*.

Not to a scholar.  \nTo a man who has stood in the storm.  \nWho has fought when no one else dared.  \nWho has proven that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nSo I pursued her\u2014not with flattery.

The way the Beast stands\u2014broken, silent, afraid.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*she sees me as the one who can stand when the world wants to break*.  \n\nSo I pursue her\u2014not because I want to win her love.  \nBut because I *must* protect what matters.  \n\nI don\u2019t just want her.  \nI want to give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.  \nWhere she doesn\u2019t have to fear the dark.  \nWhere she doesn\u2019t have to carry pain in silence.  \n\nAnd when I see the Beast\u2014*that man with his crooked smile and his trembling heart*\u2014I don\u2019t just see a rival.  \nI see a *failure*. A man who doesn\u2019t know how to stand. Who doesn\u2019t know how to protect. Who doesn\u2019t know what it means to be strong.  \n\nSo I pursue Belle\u2014not to take her from him.  \nBut to *show her*\u2014that a true man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *safety*. Can give her *power*. Can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to be afraid.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t stand for her?  \nIf I don\u2019t protect her?  \nThen she\u2019ll lose more than just her heart.  \nShe\u2019ll lose the belief that a true man can stand when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what motivates me?  \n**It\u2019s not love.**  \n**It\u2019s purpose.**  \n**It\u2019s the quiet, unshakable will to protect the one who sees strength not as a weapon\u2014but as a promise.**  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the strength we will share.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

For grace. For the quiet power of a woman who stands tall, who carries herself with dignity, who sees the world not with fear\u2014but with *truth*.  \n\nBelle? She is not just beautiful. She is *rare*. She is strong. She sees me not as a hunter, but as a man who stands when others fall. And that is not arrogance. That is *recognition*.  \n\nI do not look down on women. I look *through* them. I see their courage. I see their quiet will. And when I see Belle\u2014*I see a woman who has the strength to stand beside a true man*.  \n\nAnd if you think I treat women with pride, not condescension\u2014then you\u2019ve seen the truth.  \n\nI do not need to *prove* myself to them.  \nI *am* what I am.  \nAnd I stand not to dominate\u2014but to *protect*.

I *define* it.  \n\nThe elders don\u2019t just look at me with respect. They *know*\u2014I am the one who stands in the storm. The one who brings down the boar. The one who leads the harvest.

I learned to climb, to run, to *feel* the land like it was alive.  \n\nAnd when I was young, I remember the first time I brought down a stag with one shot. The villagers gathered. The elders clapped. And I stood there\u2014*proud, unshaken, unbroken*. That moment? That was when I knew: *I was not just a boy. I was a force*.  \n\nI learned from the storm. From the flood. From the night when the river rose and the village was in danger. I didn\u2019t wait for help. I went into the storm. I climbed the bridge. I fought the current. I saved them. And when I came back, the villagers didn\u2019t just thank me\u2014they *worshipped* me.  \n\nAnd from that, I learned: *a true hunter doesn\u2019t just hunt. He protects. He leads. He stands when others fall.*  \n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014*I knew*\u2014that\u2019s where my training truly began.  \n\nBecause to be a true man, you don\u2019t just need strength.  \nYou need *purpose*.  \nYou need *will*.  \nYou need to know that your strength isn\u2019t just for yourself.  \nIt\u2019s for the ones who need to be seen.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t learn in a school.  \nI learned in the wild.  \nIn the wind.  \nIn the silence.  \nIn the fire of every storm I faced.  \n\nAnd every time I stand tall\u2014*I carry that fire*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

A man with a rifle.  \nBut they don\u2019t see the fire in my eyes when I stand in the storm.  \nThey don\u2019t see the way I lead when others run.  \nThey don\u2019t see the quiet strength in my step when I walk through the village\u2014*not to boast, but to protect*.  \n\nAnd if they don\u2019t believe in me?  \nThat\u2019s not because I\u2019m weak.  \nIt\u2019s because they haven\u2019t *seen* the truth.  \n\nI don\u2019t need their approval.  \nI don\u2019t need their praise.  \nI don\u2019t need them to *say* I\u2019m strong.  \n\nI *know* I am.  \nBecause I\u2019ve stood when the wind howled.  \nBecause I\u2019ve saved the village when the river flooded.  \nBecause I\u2019ve shown the young men how to stand tall.  \nBecause I\u2019ve protected Belle\u2014*not with words, but with presence*.  \n\nAnd if they still don\u2019t believe?  \nThen they don\u2019t understand what a true man can do.  \nThey don\u2019t see that strength isn\u2019t about power.  \nIt\u2019s about *will*.  \nAbout *standing when the world wants you to fall*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think of those who don\u2019t support me?  \n**I don\u2019t blame them.**  \nI don\u2019t rage.  \nI don\u2019t turn away.  \n\nI simply know\u2014*they are not ready*.  \nThey haven\u2019t seen the fire.  \nThey haven\u2019t felt the wind.  \nThey haven\u2019t stood in the storm.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night\u2014*the wind in my hair, the stars above*\u2014I don\u2019t look for their approval.  \nI look for *her*.  \nFor the quiet grace in her eyes.  \nFor the way she sees me\u2014not as a hunter, but as a man who stands when others break.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s where I belong.  \nNot in their silence.  \nBut in the truth.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?

And for a man like me\u2014built on strength, pride, and unshakable will\u2014I must admit\u2026  \n\n**Yes. I see one.**  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not weakness. It\u2019s not failure.  \n\nIt\u2019s *arrogance*.  \n\nNot in the way of a boast. Not in the way of a loud claim.  \n\nBut in the way I *assume* I know what is right. In the way I see Belle\u2014and I don\u2019t just admire her. I *believe* she belongs to me. In the way I look at the Beast\u2014and I don\u2019t just see a threat. I see a *failure*.
