 \n\nAlternative:  \n- Row 1 is *top*, row 8 is *bottom*?  \n- Then *up* = decrease row.  \n\nLet\u2019s try that.  \n\n**Alternative coordinate system**:  \n- Row 1 = top  \n- Row 8 = bottom  \n- So *up* = decrease row  \n- *down* = increase row  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. **up 2** \u2192 row: 1 \u2013 2 = \u20131 \u2192 invalid.  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nSo the only logical conclusion is that the movement is *within bounds*, and the instructions are valid.  \n\nBut from (1,1):  \n- up 2 \u2192 (3,1)  \n- right 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \n- down 4 \u2192 (3\u20134,2) = (\u20131,2) \u2192 invalid  \n\nSo something is wrong.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the starting point is (8,8)?

 \nIn some systems, *up* means *toward the top*, so if row 1 is top, then *up* = decrease row.  \n\nBut if row 1 is bottom, *up* = increase row.  \n\nLet\u2019s assume **row 1 is the bottom** (standard in many systems).  \n\nSo:  \n- up \u2192 +row  \n- down \u2192 \u2013row  \n- left \u2192 \u2013col  \n- right \u2192 +col  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 (1+2,1) = (3,1)  \n2. right 1 \u2192 (3,1+1) = (3,2)  \n3. down 4 \u2192 (3\u20134,2) = (\u20131,2) \u2192 invalid  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nBut maybe the instructions are meant to be applied *only if possible*, and we stop?

 \nOr maybe it\u2019s (1,1) and we just go.  \n\nBut the only way to make it work is to assume the movement is valid.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe I misread the instructions.  \n\nThe input is:  \n`up 2<sep>right 1<sep>down 4<sep>left 3`  \n\nSo:  \n- up 2  \n- right 1  \n- down 4  \n- left 3  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\nAfter up 2 \u2192 (3,1)  \nAfter right 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \nAfter down 4 \u2192 (3\u20134,2) = (\u20131,2) \u2192 invalid  \n\nAfter left 3 \u2192 (\u20131,2\u20133) = (\u20131,\u20131) \u2192 invalid  \n\nSo no valid final position.  \n\nBut that can\u2019t be.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the coordinates are *row and column*, and we start at (1,1), and we just apply the moves \u2014 even if out of bounds?  \n\nBut the problem says *final position* \u2014 so it must be within 1\u20138.  \n\nUnless the board wraps.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not stated.  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the starting point is (8,8)?  \nLet\u2019s try that.  \n\nStart: (8,8)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 (8\u20132,8) = (6,8)  \n2. right 1 \u2192 (6,8+1) = (6,9) \u2192 invalid (max column 8)  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nStart: (1,1) \u2014 only valid if we don\u2019t go below 1.  \n\nSo perhaps the movement is *only applied if within bounds*, and we stop when we go out?  \n\nBut the problem says *after all instructions have been executed*.  \n\nSo I think there\u2019s a mistake in the problem.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume the board is 1-based, and we apply the moves *as written*, and if out of bounds, we stop.  \n\nBut again, the problem says *after all instructions have been executed*.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe the direction is wrong.  \n\nAlternative:  \n- up = decrease row  \n- down = increase row  \n- left = decrease col  \n- right = increase col  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 (1\u20132,1) = (\u20131,1) \u2192 invalid  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nSo the only possibility is that the starting point is (8,8), and we go:  \n\n(8,8)  \nup 2 \u2192 (6,8)  \nright 1 \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 invalid  \n\nNo.  \n\nPerhaps the instructions are meant to be applied in a loop?  \n\nNo.  \n\nI think there\u2019s a typo.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume the movement is valid and we just go.  \n\nMaybe the starting point is (4,4)?  \n\nNo.  \n\nPerhaps the final position is just calculated mathematically, and we ignore bounds.  \n\nSo:  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \nup 2 \u2192 (3,1)  \nright 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \ndown 4 \u2192 (3\u20134,2) = (\u20131,2)  \nleft 3 \u2192 (\u20131,2\u20133) = (\u20131,\u20131)  \n\nFinal position: (\u20131,\u20131) \u2014 not valid.  \n\nSo I must conclude: **the instructions are invalid**.  \n\nBut since the problem asks for a final position, and we must provide one, perhaps the intended interpretation is:  \n\n- Start at (1,1)  \n- Apply moves as written, and if out of bounds, wrap around (mod 8)  \n\nLet\u2019s try that.  \n\nRows and columns from 1 to 8.  \nWrap around: use modulo arithmetic, but adjust for 1-based indexing.  \n\nSo:  \n- row = ((row + delta) - 1) % 8 + 1  \n- col = ((col + delta) - 1) % 8 + 1  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \n\n1. up 2 \u2192 row += 2 \u2192 1+2 = 3 \u2192 (3,1)  \n2. right 1 \u2192 col +=1 \u2192 1+1 = 2 \u2192 (3,2)  \n3. down 4 \u2192 row -=4 \u2192 3\u20134 = \u20131 \u2192 (\u20131+8) = 7 \u2192 (7,2)  \n4. left 3 \u2192 col -=3 \u2192 2\u20133 = \u20131 \u2192 (7, \u20131+8) = (7,7)  \n\nFinal position: **(7,7)**  \n\n\u2705 Within bounds.  \n\u2705 All moves applied.  \n\u2705 Uses wrap-around (common in games).  \n\nSo I\u2019ll go with that.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **77**", "Let\u2019s check the list:  \n**[10 kg, 9 kg, 8 kg, 7 kg]**  \n\nWe go from left to right:  \n- 10 kg \u2192 9 kg \u2192 8 kg \u2192 7 kg  \n\nIs each weight *heavier than the next*?
