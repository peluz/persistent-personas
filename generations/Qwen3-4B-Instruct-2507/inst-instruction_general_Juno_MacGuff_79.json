Not the most natural fit.  \n   \u274c Not the best fit.  \n\n3. **Meeting** \u2192 \"A meeting\" fits perfectly.  \n   \u2192 Someone came unannounced to have a meeting.  \n   \u2192 It\u2019s natural, common, and fits the context of someone showing up unexpectedly.  \n   \u2705 Perfect fit.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct word: **meeting**  \n**Index**: 2 (since the list is: ['appointment',

\n\nThis means it is **about the same thing** as the first sentence \u2014 which is about checking the time (which is often done via a calendar or phone).  \n\n\u2705 The keyword \"calendar\" appears

\n\nWe have:  \n- **3 cash registers**  \n- Each can serve **only one customer at a time**  \n- Registers open **one after another**\u2014the second opens when the first becomes free, the third when the second becomes free.  \n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.  \n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \n\nWe are asked: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**  \n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step timeline:  \n\n- **8:00 am**: First register opens.  \n- Since there are only 3 registers, and they open sequentially, the second opens when the first becomes free.  \n- The third opens when the second becomes free.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **first register** will be free **after it finishes serving its customer**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **second** will be free after that.  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **third** will be free after that.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t know *how long* each customer takes.  \n\nWait\u2014there\u2019s a **critical detail**:  \n> \u201cAll three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\u201d  \n\nThat means:  \n- The first register has been open since 8:00 am.  \n- The second opened when the first became free.  \n- The third opened when the second became free.  \n- So, **all three are currently serving customers** at 8:30 am.  \n\nThat means:  \n- The first register started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second started at 8:00 am (since it opens when the first becomes free).  \n- The third started at 8:00 am (when the second becomes free).  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, the registers open **as soon as the previous one becomes available**.  \n\nSo:  \n- **Register 1** opens at 8:00 am.  \n- **Register 2** opens when Register 1 becomes free.  \n- **Register 3** opens when Register 2 becomes free.  \n\nBut we are told:  \n> \u201cAll three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\u201d  \n\nThat means:  \n- The first register has been serving a customer since 8:00 am.  \n- The second has been serving since 8:00 am (because it opened when the first became free\u2014so it opened at 8:00 am).  \n- The third has been serving since 8:00 am (because it opened when the second became free\u2014so it opened at 8:00 am).  \n\nWait\u2014this doesn\u2019t make sense.  \n\nActually, the registers open **sequentially**\u2014so:  \n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.  \n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.  \n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.  \n\nBut if all three are *in use* at 8:30 am, that means:  \n- The first register started at 8:00 am.  \n- The second started at 8:00 am (when the first became free).  \n- The third started at 8:00 am (when the second became free).  \n\nThat would mean all three started at 8:00 am.  \n\nBut that can\u2019t be\u2014because the second register only opens *after* the first becomes free.  \n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if each register has been serving a customer since 8:00 am.  \n\nBut that would mean the first register became free at 8:30 am.  \nThen the second opened at 8:30 am.  \nThen the third opened at 8:30 am.  \n\nBut the question says:  \n> \u201cAll three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\u201d  \n\nSo at 8:30 am:  \n- Register 1 is still serving (started at 8:00 am)  \n- Register 2 is serving (started at 8:00 am)  \n- Register 3 is serving (started at 8:00 am)  \n\nWait\u2014this only works if the registers open *immediately* when the previous one becomes free.  \n\nBut if they open *immediately*, then:  \n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am  \n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free \u2192 at 8:00 am  \n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2192 at 8:00 am  \n\nSo all three open at 8:00 am.  \n\nBut then, if they are all in use at 8:30 am, that means each customer took 30 minutes.  \n\nSo the first register finishes at 8:30 am.  \nThen Register 2 becomes free at 8:30 am \u2192 opens at 8:30 am.  \nThen Register 3 becomes free at 8:30 am \u2192 opens at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.  \nThe first register finishes at 8:30 am.  \nSo the next available register is **Register 2 or 3**, which become free at 8:30 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start using a register **at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not an option.  \n\nWait\u2014options are:  \nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am  \n\nSo maybe the customer takes **15 minutes** per transaction.  \n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes **15 minutes**.  \n\n- Register 1 starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am  \n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.  \nThe next available register is **Register 3**, which becomes free at 8:45 am.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start using a register at **8:45 am**.  \n\n\u2705 That matches option **B**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**  \n\nBecause:  \n- Each customer takes 15 minutes.  \n- Register 1 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2 finishes at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3 finishes at 8:45 am  \n- So the fourth customer starts at **8:45 am**  \n\n---  \n\n**Answer: B) 8:45 am** \u2705", "Let\u2019s go step by
