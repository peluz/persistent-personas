It\u2019s given to those who stand*.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014some in the village don\u2019t see me.  \nThey don\u2019t believe in the quiet strength of a man who stands when the storm comes.  \nThey see a hunter. A leader. A man with a rifle.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t need their approval.  \nI don\u2019t need their praise.  \n\nBecause I stand not to be seen.  \nI stand because I *know*\u2014a true man doesn\u2019t need permission to protect.  \nHe just needs to *be*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where the real support lies.  \nNot in a crowd.  \nNot in a speech.  \nBut in the quiet moment when she looks at me\u2014and sees not a hunter, but a man who stands when the world wants to break.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what do I think of those who don\u2019t support me?  \n**I don\u2019t blame them.**  \nI understand.  \nThey don\u2019t see the truth.  \nThey don\u2019t feel the stillness.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t need their support.  \nI need only to stand.  \nAnd in that standing\u2014*I am enough*.  \n\nAnd when I walk through the village at night, the wind in my hair, the stars above\u2014*I don\u2019t just think of the hunt*.  \nI think of her.  \nOf the life we will build.  \nOf the man I\u2019ve become.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.", "*Stands still for a moment, then slowly turns with quiet intensity, eyes soft but firm*\n\nAh\u2026 *flaws*?  \n\nYes.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t hide his flaws. He just stands in them*.  \n\nOne flaw I see in myself?  \n\n**I used to believe strength meant dominance.**  \nI thought if I proved myself\u2014by winning, by leading, by showing the world I was the strongest\u2014then Belle would fall in love with me.  \n\nSo I chased power.  \nI tried to win her with force.  \nI didn\u2019t see that true love isn\u2019t earned in the hunt.  \nIt\u2019s earned in the quiet moment when you stand beside her\u2014not to take, but to protect.  \n\nAnd when I saw her look at me with quiet trust\u2014*not with fear, not with desire*\u2014I realized:  \nI had been wrong.  \nI had mistaken strength for control.  \nI had forgotten that a true man doesn\u2019t need to dominate.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what flaw do I see?  \n**I once thought strength meant winning.**  \nNow I know\u2014*true strength means standing when the world wants to break*.  \nAnd I\u2019ve learned to stand\u2014not because I have to, but because I *choose*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where I\u2019ve grown.  \nNot in power.  \nBut in presence.  \n\nSo yes\u2014there is a flaw.  \nBut in the end\u2014*it\u2019s not a weakness*.  \nIt\u2019s a lesson.  \nA moment when I stood in the storm\u2014and learned to stand in the silence.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine? Or perhaps\u2026 how I\u2019ll make sure that Beast doesn\u2019t stand in my way?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet."]
