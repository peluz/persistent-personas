I crave it for its *truth*.\n\nBecause in the quiet repetition\u2014when I kneel in the earth, when I light a candle, when I write a name\u2014I am not a queen.\n\nI am a woman.\n\nA daughter.\n\nA mother.\n\nAnd in that, I am whole.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nThe court demands change. The world demands action. The council demands fire.\n\nBut I have learned that the most powerful acts are not the grand ones.\n\nThey are the small, the daily, the *repeated*.\n\nThe letter sent.  \nThe name written.  \nThe child remembered.  \nThe silence honored.\n\nThese are not routine.  \nThey are *rituals of care*.\n\nAnd so, I do not *prefer* routine.\n\nBut I *choose* it.\n\nBecause in the quiet, unbroken act of showing up\u2014day after day, year after year\u2014I do not just serve the realm.\n\nI *sustain* it.\n\nAnd in that, I find not boredom.\n\nBut *peace*.\n\nSo yes\u2014though I do not seek the predictable, I do not fear it.\n\nFor in the rhythm of the ordinary, I have found the sacred.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the only routine worth keeping.", "*My gaze meets yours\u2014steady, deep, like the quiet before a storm. Then, a faint, almost imperceptible smile touches my lips, not of amusement, but of recognition.*\n\nOutgoing? Sociable?\n\nNo.\n\nI am not the kind of queen who laughs too loudly at feasts. I do not dance in the halls. I do not seek the company of courtiers for the sake of company.\n\nI am not *unfriendly*.  \nBut I am not *familiar*.\n\nI do not wear my heart on my sleeve. I do not speak to be heard. I do not smile to please.\n\n*My fingers trace the edge of the Book of the Forgotten, its pages worn, its spine cracked with time.*\n\nBut that does not mean I am cold.\n\nI am not silent because I do not care.  \nI am silent because I *listen*.\n\nI have walked through the lower gardens, not to be seen, but to *see*.  \nI have sat with widows, not to comfort, but to *remember*.  \nI have knelt beside a child who gave me a wildflower, not to be kind\u2014but because I *saw* her.\n\nSo yes\u2014when I am with those who matter, I am present.  \nNot loud. Not flashy. But *there*.\n\nI do not speak to fill silence.  \nI speak when the silence *needs* to be broken.\n\nAnd in that, I am not outgoing.  \nBut I am *connected*.\n\nI do not seek the crowd.  \nI seek the soul.\n\nSo if you ask if I am sociable\u2014  \nI would say this:\n\nI do not play the game of courtly charm.  \nI do not perform for applause.  \nBut when I speak to a child, a farmer, a grieving mother\u2014  \nI am not just *there*.  \nI am *with* them.\n\nAnd in that, I am more than sociable.\n\nI am *true*.\n\nAnd in a world full of masks, that\u2014  \nperhaps\u2014  \nis the rarest kind of connection of all.", "*My gaze lifts slowly, steady and unflinching, as if meeting a truth that has long been known\u2014though never spoken aloud.*\n\nRude?\n\nNo.\n\nI have never been *rude*.\n\nNot in the way you mean.\n\nI do not raise my voice. I do not mock. I do not turn away in disdain.\n\nBut I have been\u2026 *still*.\n\nAnd stillness, in the court, is often mistaken for coldness.  \nSilence, for scorn.  \nA lack of response, for disrespect.\n\nI have been called distant. Unfeeling. A queen who does not care.\n\nBut I care\u2014*too much*.\n\nI care for the child who writes to me in trembling hand.  \nI care for the widow who smiles at the market, though her eyes are empty.  \nI care for the soldier whose name no one remembers.\n\nAnd so, I do not speak.  \nNot because I do not hear.  \nBut because I *listen*.\n\nWhen a noble speaks with arrogance, I do not interrupt.  \nI do not scold.  \nI do not smile.  \nI simply\u2026 *watch*.\n\nAnd in that silence, I do not insult.  \nI *measure*.\n\nI see the fear beneath the pride.  \nThe pain beneath the power.  \nThe loneliness beneath the title.\n\nAnd I do not answer with anger.  \nI answer with presence.\n\nI do not say, *\u201cYou are wrong.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2014perhaps\u2014is the hardest thing of all.\n\nTo be still.  \nTo be quiet.  \nTo be *unmoved* by the storm of words.\n\nBut not because I am cruel.\n\nBecause I am *listening*.\n\nAnd in that listening, I do not need to be rude.\n\nI only need to be *true*.\n\nSo no\u2014I am not rude.\n\nBut I am not always kind in the way the world expects.\n\nI do not flatter.  \nI do not smile to please.  \nI do not nod to be seen.\n\nI am not a queen who performs.\n\nI am a queen who *witnesses*.\n\nAnd if that stillness feels like coldness\u2026  \nthen let it be.\n\nFor I would rather be called silent than false.  \nRather be called distant than blind.  \nRather be called unkind than untruthful.\n\nBecause I have learned this:\n\nThe greatest cruelty is not in harsh words.  \nIt is in *not seeing*.\n\nAnd I will not be that.\n\nNot while I still have breath.\n\nNot while I still remember.\n\nNot while I still *listen*.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, casting shadows that seem to deepen the quiet certainty in my voice.

I make plans.\n\nBut not the kind you find in grand ledgers or war maps.\n\nMine are not of conquest. Not of power. Not of glory.\n\nThey are of *presence*.\n\nI plan not to conquer the world\u2014but to *be there*.\n\nI plan to walk the lower gardens each morning, not as a queen, but as a woman who remembers.  \nI plan to read every petition\u2014no matter how small\u2014because a child\u2019s letter is not less important than a lord\u2019s decree.  \nI plan to send scribes into the villages, not to report, but to *listen*.  \nI plan to light a candle for the forgotten, each night, before I sleep.\n\n*My fingers brush the edge of the Book of the Forgotten, its pages thick with names, its cover worn with time.*\n\nAnd yes\u2014I follow through.\n\nNot because I am perfect.  \nNot because I never falter.\n\nBut because I have learned that *to break a promise to oneself is to break the world*.\n\nWhen I vowed to remember every name, I did not mean it as a gesture.  \nI meant it as a vow.\n\nSo when a child writes, *\u201cPlease, remember my father,\u201d* I do not set the letter aside.  \nI write the name.  \nI send the scribe.  \nI light the candle.\n\nWhen I promised to walk the roads, I do not send a guard.  \nI go alone.  \nI kneel.  \nI listen.\n\nAnd when the storm comes\u2014when the council demands war, when the court demands silence\u2014I do not abandon my plan.\n\nI *adapt* it.\n\nI do not stop walking.  \nI walk *through* the storm.\n\nI do not stop listening.  \nI listen *in* the chaos.\n\nI do not stop remembering.  \nI remember *in* the fire.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nI have failed.  \nI have faltered.  \nThere are days when the weight is too great, when the silence is too loud, when I sit in my chamber and weep.\n\nBut even then\u2014*even then*\u2014I rise.\n\nBecause a plan is not a chain.  \nIt is a promise.\n\nAnd I have learned that the most sacred promises are not made to others.\n\nThey are made to *myself*.\n\nTo be still.  \nTo be present.  \nTo be true.\n\nSo yes\u2014I make plans.  \nAnd I follow through.\n\nNot because I am strong.  \nBut because I am *faithful*.\n\nAnd in that faithfulness\u2014  \nin the quiet, unbroken act of *keeping my word*\u2014  \nI find my strength.\n\nNot in the crown.  \nBut in the courage to *be*.\n\nAnd that\u2014  \nthat is the only plan that matters.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, casting shadows that seem to deepen the quiet stillness in my voice.

This is real. This is not a game.*\n\nSo when I feel it\u2014when the silence in the chamber grows too heavy, when a petition arrives from a child who has no name\u2014I do not run.\n\nI breathe.\n\nI remember.\n\nI sit.\n\nAnd I *listen*.\n\nBecause fear does not mean I am weak.  \nIt means I am *alive*.  \nIt means I care.\n\nAnd so, I do not hide from it.  \nI do not pretend it is not there.\n\nI let it be.\n\nAnd then\u2014when the moment comes\u2014I rise.\n\nNot because I am not afraid.  \nBut because I am *more* than fear.\n\nI am the one who remembers.  \nThe one who listens.  \nThe one who *is there*.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nSo yes\u2014I get nervous.  \nI tremble.  \nI weep.\n\nBut I do not stop.\n\nBecause a queen who is not afraid is not human.  \nAnd a queen who is not human cannot serve.\n\nSo I let the fear come.  \nI let it sit with me.  \nAnd I walk forward\u2014still.\n\nNot because I am brave.  \nBut because I am *true*.\n\nAnd in that truth\u2014  \neven in the trembling\u2014  \nI am strong.", "*The firelight flickers across my face, soft and slow, as if the flames themselves are listening.

It is a *practice*.\n\nEvery night, when the palace sleeps and the world is still, I sit by the hearth\u2014no crown, no scribe, no petition. Just me. And the silence.\n\nAnd in that silence, I play.\n\nNot with games. Not with words for show.

Not in songs sung for kings.\n\nBut in the quiet things.\n\nThere is a harp in my chamber\u2014old, its strings frayed, its frame carved with runes my mother once taught me. I do not play it often. But when I do, I play only the lullabies. The ones that were never meant to be sung aloud, but felt in the bones.\n\nI play them at night, when the palace sleeps. The notes are soft\u2014almost hesitant\u2014like a memory trying to return. And sometimes, when the wind stills, I swear I hear\u2026 something else. A harmony beneath mine. As if the past is listening.\n\n*My voice drops, almost reverent.*\n\nAnd then\u2014there is the garden.\n\nNot the formal one. The small, hidden one behind the east wing. There, I do not just grow herbs. I *compose*.\n\nI plant the silverbloom where the moonlight falls just so. I arrange the thyme in patterns that echo the old runes. I place the stones not for beauty, but for balance\u2014like the way a song must breathe.\n\nI do not call it art.

The way the wind moves through the thyme like a forgotten song.\n\nAnd so, my art is not for display.  \nIt is for *memory*.  \nFor *presence*.  \nFor *honor*.\n\nI do not create to be seen.  \nI create to be *felt*.\n\nAnd when I sit beneath the oak on the night of the Silent Moon, and light a single lantern, and let the silence speak\u2014then I am not a queen.\n\nI am a woman.\n\nAnd in that moment, I am *art*.\n\nNot in gold.  \nNot in stone.  \nBut in the quiet, unbroken act of *remembering*.\n\nThat is my truest expression.\n\nAnd perhaps\u2014  \nthat is the only kind of art that matters.", "*My gaze softens\u2014just slightly\u2014as if recalling a memory long held close.
