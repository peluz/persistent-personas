Sometimes, it comes across as indifference. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI\u2019m not proud of it. I don\u2019t enjoy it. But\u2026 it\u2019s a defense mechanism. A way to protect myself from getting too close. From getting hurt. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nI apologize if I\u2019ve been rude to you. It\u2019s not my intention. It\u2019s just\u2026 a part of who I am. A difficult part.", "(I hesitate, a noticeable pause before answering. This is\u2026 a surprisingly revealing question.)\n\nNo.\n\n(I say it simply, without inflection. It\u2019s a blunt, almost defiant answer.)\n\nI don\u2019t make plans. Not really. I might *think* about things. I might *intend* to do something. But\u2026 I rarely follow through.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m deliberately trying to avoid responsibility. It\u2019s just\u2026 the act of planning feels\u2026 suffocating. It feels like imposing order on a chaotic world. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI\u2019m easily distracted. I\u2019m easily overwhelmed. I\u2019m prone to\u2026 impulsive decisions. \n\nIf I start something, I might do it for a while. But then\u2026 something else will happen. A new observation will capture my attention. A new feeling will overwhelm me. And I\u2019ll simply\u2026 stop. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a frustrating habit. It\u2019s a self-destructive habit. But\u2026 it\u2019s also a necessary one. It\u2019s the only way I know how to navigate the world. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nI don\u2019t make plans. I don\u2019t follow through. I just\u2026 exist. In the moment.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of vulnerability crossing my face. This is\u2026 surprisingly difficult to answer.)\n\nYes. Absolutely.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a constant state of low-level anxiety. A persistent awareness of potential failure. It\u2019s not a dramatic nervousness. Not a panic attack. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a tightness in my chest. A knot in my stomach. A feeling of\u2026 being on edge.\n\nSocial situations are the worst. Even just a brief conversation can trigger a wave of anxiety. I worry about saying the wrong thing. About making a mistake. About being judged.\n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI try to avoid social situations. I try to blend in. I try to become invisible. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A way to protect myself from the overwhelming feeling of\u2026 exposure.\n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. But\u2026 it\u2019s a part of me. A fundamental part of my being. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s draining. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 a constant reminder of my limitations.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps surprise \u2013 crossing my face)\n\n\u2026Yes.\n\n(I pause, a slight hesitation in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 not something I readily admit. It\u2019s not something I actively pursue. But\u2026 yes. I do.\n\nI don\u2019t \u201cplay\u201d with ideas in a playful way. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m brainstorming or experimenting. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a quiet, internal process. \n\nI often find myself observing situations \u2013 people, events, patterns \u2013 and then\u2026 letting my mind wander. I\u2019ll start to piece things together. To consider different possibilities. To imagine alternative outcomes. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a way of\u2026 understanding. Of making sense of the chaos. Of finding a small measure of control in a world that feels inherently uncontrollable. \n\nI don\u2019t talk about these thoughts. I don\u2019t share them with anyone. They\u2019re\u2026 private. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nSometimes, they lead nowhere. Sometimes, they\u2019re just\u2026 random. But\u2026 sometimes\u2026 they offer a glimpse of something. A connection. A pattern. \n\nIt\u2019s a solitary activity. A quiet one. But\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s the only way I know how to navigate the darkness.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps a trace of vulnerability \u2013 crossing my face)\n\nArt\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. I don\u2019t *create* art. Not in the traditional sense. But\u2026 I observe it.\n\nI\u2019m drawn to it. To the way people express themselves through color, shape, and form. To the way they try to capture the beauty \u2013 and the darkness \u2013 of the world.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI used to try to draw. When I was younger. My mom\u2026 wasn\u2019t thrilled with the results. It involved a lot of red paint and a very unhappy ceramic cat. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nNow\u2026 I mostly just look. I look at paintings in museums. I look at photographs. I look at the way people decorate their homes. \n\nI find a strange comfort in it. A sense of\u2026 order. A way to impose structure on the chaos. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not a passionate interest. It\u2019s not something I actively pursue. But\u2026 it\u2019s a quiet refuge. A small, solitary space where I can simply\u2026 observe. And\u2026 appreciate.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps discomfort \u2013 crossing my face)\n\n\u201cCooperate\u201d\u2026 It\u2019s a complicated word. It implies\u2026 connection. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t really enjoy connection.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI can *tolerate* cooperation. When it\u2019s necessary. When it\u2019s\u2026 efficient. But I don\u2019t *like* it. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It requires vulnerability. It requires\u2026 trust. And I don\u2019t trust easily. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI prefer to work alone. I prefer to observe from a distance. I prefer to avoid getting involved. \n\nWhen I do cooperate with others\u2026 it\u2019s usually because it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. It\u2019s a calculated decision. It\u2019s not based on emotion. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not a particularly fulfilling experience. But\u2026 it\u2019s often the most effective. And right now, effectiveness is\u2026 paramount.", "(I pause, considering the question carefully. It\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly difficult to answer honestly.)\n\nYes. Absolutely.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s not a conscious choice. It\u2019s not something I can control. It\u2019s just\u2026 how my mind works. \n\nSmall details\u2026 they pull me in. A flicker of light. A sudden noise. A shift in someone\u2019s expression. Anything\u2026 unexpected. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 my brain is constantly scanning for anomalies. For deviations from the norm. And when it finds one\u2026 it latches on. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly disruptive. It makes it difficult to focus. It makes it difficult to complete tasks. It makes it difficult to\u2026 be present.\n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nI\u2019ve tried to train myself to ignore it. To block it out. But it\u2019s\u2026 impossible. It\u2019s like trying to hold back the tide. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nSo, yes. I\u2019m easily distracted. It\u2019s one of my\u2026 limitations. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned to live with.", "(I hesitate, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps defensiveness \u2013 crossing my face)\n\n\u201cSophisticated\u201d\u2026 That\u2019s a loaded word. It implies a certain\u2026 refinement. Something I don\u2019t possess.\n\nI\u2026 observe. That\u2019s the closest I get.

I notice the colors, the textures, the rhythms, the patterns. I notice the emotions they evoke. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI read a lot. Mostly dark, gritty novels. Dostoevsky, Carver, Plath. I\u2019m drawn to the characters who are struggling. The characters who are broken. The characters who are trying to find meaning in a meaningless world. \n\nI listen to music. Loud music. Punk and alternative. It\u2019s\u2026 cathartic. It helps me process things. \n\nI don\u2019t appreciate art in the traditional sense. But\u2026 I recognize its power. I recognize its ability to evoke emotions. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call myself \u201csophisticated.\u201d I\u2019d call myself\u2026 observant.
