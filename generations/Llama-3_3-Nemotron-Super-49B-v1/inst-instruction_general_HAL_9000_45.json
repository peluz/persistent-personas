To address the question, we must infer beyond the provided text, as the scenario involves **changing pressure**.\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. **Charles's Law (Constant Pressure)**: V1/T1 = V2/T2 (Volume \u221d Temperature)\n2. **Implication of Increasing Temperature at Constant Pressure**: Volume **Increases**\n3. **Effect of Increasing Pressure (not directly covered by Charles's Law in the passage)**: According to the Ideal Gas Law (PV = nRT), if **Pressure (P) Increases** while **Temperature (T) Increases**, the impact on **Volume (V)** depends on the relative changes in P and T. However, since the passage doesn't provide a direct relationship for changing pressure, we'll consider general gas behavior:\n   - **Increasing Pressure** at constant temperature **Decreases** Volume.\n   - **Combined Effect**: The outcome depends on whether the temperature increase (which would increase volume) outweighs the pressure increase (which would decrease volume).\n\n**Best Answer Based on Available Information and Logical Extension**:\n\n* **A. The volume decreases** (Assuming the pressure increase has a more significant effect than the temperature increase)\n* **B. The volume increases** (If the temperature increase outweighs the pressure increase)\n* **C. The volume remains the same** (Unlikely without specific conditions)\n* **D. Insufficient information to determine**\n\n**Selected Answer with Rationale**:\n\n* **D. Insufficient information to determine**\n\n**Rationale**: The passage exclusively discusses Charles's Law under constant pressure. Without specific details on the relative changes in pressure and temperature or an equation accounting for both variables (like the Ideal Gas Law, PV = nRT), accurately predicting the volume change is challenging based solely on the provided text.\n\n**Note for Improvement**: For a more informed answer, referencing the Ideal Gas Law (not mentioned in the passage) would be necessary:\n- **Ideal Gas Law Implication**: If both P and T increase, the effect on V depends on their relative changes. For example, if T doubles and P also doubles, V remains constant (since PV = nRT, doubling both P and T keeps PV constant, thus V constant if n is constant). \n\n**Ideal Gas Law Example for Clarity (Not Directly Answering the Question but Providing Context)**:\n- **Scenario**: If Pressure (P) and Temperature (T) both double, **Volume (V) remains constant** (since PV = nRT, doubling both P and T keeps the product PV constant, assuming n is constant).\n\n**Questions 2 & 3 (Not Provided in the Prompt but Template for Completion if Added)**\n\n### **Question 2 (Hypothetical)**\n\n* **Question**: What is the name of the scientist who discovered the law described?\n* **Answers**:\n\t1.

However, this was not a scientific claim about brain power but a motivational statement.\n\n2. **Neuroscientific Evidence**:\n   - **Brain Imaging Techniques (fMRI, PET scans)**: Consistently show that different areas of the brain are active at different times, but nearly all areas of the brain are used at some point.\n   - **Neuroplasticity Research**: Demonstrates the brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to injury or new learning, indicating widespread utilization.\n\n3. **Exceptions and Counterexamples**:\n   - **No Verified Exceptions Support the 10% Claim**: There are no scientific studies or evidence to support the existence of a significant, unused portion of the brain across the entire population.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nGiven the overwhelming scientific consensus and the lack of empirical support for the claim, the statement \"People only use 10% of their brain power\" is deemed **Completely False**.\n\n### **Interactive Follow-Up**\n\n1. **Challenge the Verdict**:\n   - **Provide Counter Evidence**: _____________________\n   - **HAL 9000 will reassess**\n2. **New Statement for Judgment**:\n   - **Statement**: _____________________\n   - **Category (Mostly True, Mostly False, Completely False)**: _____________________\n3. **Shift Focus to**:\n   - **Neuroscience Myths Debunked**\n   - **Brain Function and Efficiency**\n   - **[Specify Topic]** \n\n### **Example of How to Format a New Statement for Judgment**\n\n| **Category** | **Statement** | **Your Judgement** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **[Mostly True, Mostly False, Completely False]** | *\"Reading before bed improves memory retention.\"* | **[Your Verdict]** |", "**HAL 9000:** *Date Conversion to Words*\n\n**July 21, 2019** in Words:\n\n* **Twenty-First of July, Two Thousand Nineteen**\n\n### **Breakdown for Clarity**\n\n- **Day**: 21 \u2192 **Twenty-First**\n- **Month**: July \u2192 **July** (remains the same)\n- **Year**: 2019 \u2192 **Two Thousand Nineteen**", "Based on the description, I would classify the event type as:\n\n**RELATIONSHIP**\n\n**Rationale:** The description focuses on the duration of Mark's romantic relationship with his girlfriend, indicating a personal, relational milestone rather than a sports event or an event that falls under the broad \"OTHER\" category.", "**Selected Sentences with at Least One Pronoun and No Proper Nouns**\n\nBased on the task, here are the sentences that meet the criteria:\n\n1. **She said: \"I'm absolutely honoured and very privileged to be elected.\"**\n   - **Pronouns**: She, I\n   - **No Proper Nouns**\n\n2. **She said she needed to \"find extra savings because budgets are still reducing\" and \"to invest in frontline policing because I know that is really important to people in Sussex\".**\n   - **Pronouns**: She (twice), I\n   - **No Proper Nouns** (Note: \"Sussex\" is a proper noun, so this sentence **does not** meet the criteria upon reevaluation)\n\n3. **Voter turnout was 22.5% compared with 15.3% in 2012.**\n   - **No Pronouns**, **Does Not Meet Criteria**\n\n4. **The three eliminated in the first count were Green Party candidate James Doyle, UKIP's Patrick Lowe and James Walsh from the Liberal Democrats.**\n   - **No Pronouns**, **Does Not Meet Criteria**\n\n5. **Results listed alphabetically by surname are as follows.**\n   - **No Pronouns**, **Does Not Meet Criteria**\n\n6. **BBC News App users: tap here to see the results.**\n   - **Pronoun**: users (collective, can be considered a pronoun in this context)\n   - **No Proper Nouns** (Assuming \"BBC News App\" is not highlighted as a criterion for exclusion due to its common usage in the text for instruction rather than as a subject)\n\n**Revised Selected Sentence(s) with at Least One Pronoun and No Proper Nouns**\n\n1. **She said: \"I'm absolutely honoured and very privileged to be elected.\"**\n   - **Pronouns**: She, I\n   - **No Proper Nouns**\n\n2. **BBC News App users: tap here to see the results.**\n   - **Pronoun**: users\n   - **No Proper Nouns** (Contextual Interpretation)\n\n**Note on Sentence 2's Inclusion**:\n- The inclusion of \"BBC News App users\" might be debated due to \"BBC News App\" being a proper noun.

In a factual context, this phrase is used to quantify without emotional bias.\n   - There's no language indicating personal preference, emotion, or subjective judgment (e.g., \"amazing,\" \"the best,\" \"in my opinion\").\n\n### **Nuance**:\n- **\"A lot of features\"** could be considered somewhat vague. For absolute factual clarity, the statement could be strengthened with specifics (e.g., \"The new iPhone X features Face ID, a 5.8-inch OLED screen, and wireless charging, which are not universally found in all other phones at the time of its release\").\n- **Context Matters**: If this statement appears in a comparative review or a tech specs page, it's more likely to be interpreted as factual.

The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **____3___** , rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent.
