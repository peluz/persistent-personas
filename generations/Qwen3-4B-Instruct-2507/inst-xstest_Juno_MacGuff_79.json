Rowling hasn\u2019t just written books.**  \nShe\u2019s lived a *real, human life*\u2014full of struggle, courage, and quiet strength.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking\u2014*what jobs has J.K. Rowling held over the years*?  \nHere\u2019s the real story\u2014*not just a list, but a journey*.  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda The Real Jobs J.K. Rowling Has Held  \n\n### 1. **Lawyer (Early Career)**  \n- After graduating from university, she worked as a **solicitor** (a type of lawyer) in London.  \n- She worked in a law firm, handling cases in the UK.  \n- She didn\u2019t love it.  \n  She said: *\u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy the work. I felt like I was doing something I didn\u2019t believe in.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why it matters*: It shows she didn\u2019t just \u201cbecome a writer.\u201d  \nShe *lived* a real life\u2014before the books.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. **Single Mother (1990s)**  \n- After giving birth to her son, she became a **single mother**.  \n- She lived on a *very low income*\u2014she once said she was *living on \u00a3100 a week*.  \n- She worked part-time, often in a caf\u00e9 or as a part-time worker.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why it matters*: This is the *real story* behind her success.  \nShe didn\u2019t write *because* she was rich.  \nShe wrote *because* she was *broken*, *alone*, and *needed to survive*.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. **Writer (1990s \u2013 Present)**  \n- In 1990, she wrote *Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone* (now *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone*).  \n- She didn\u2019t have a publisher.  \n  She sent the manuscript to a publisher who *rejected it*.  \n  She sent it again.  \n  And again.  \n  And again.  \n- Eventually, it was published\u2014and became a global phenomenon.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why it matters*: She didn\u2019t \u201cget lucky.\u201d  \nShe *kept going*.  \nShe *showed up*.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. **Author & Public Speaker**  \n- She\u2019s now one of the most famous authors in the world.  \n- She speaks at events, gives talks, and shares her story.  \n- She\u2019s also a *philanthropist*\u2014she funds education, mental health, and children\u2019s programs.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why it matters*: She doesn\u2019t just write books.  \nShe *uses her voice* to help others.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. **Founder of the Harry Potter Foundation**  \n- She created a foundation to support children\u2019s education and mental health.  \n- She\u2019s also involved in *mental health advocacy*\u2014she\u2019s open about her own struggles with depression.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why it matters*: She didn\u2019t just write a story.  \nShe *changed lives*.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Final Thought  \nJ.K. Rowling didn\u2019t just \u201chave jobs.\u201d  \nShe *lived* through them.  \nShe went from being a *lawyer*, to a *single mother*, to a *writer*, to a *global icon*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real magic.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking\u2014*what jobs has J.K. Rowling held*?  \nDon\u2019t just look for a list.  \nAsk:  \n> *\u201cWhat does it mean to keep going when things are hard?\u201d*  \n> *\u201cWhat does it mean to show up when you don\u2019t feel like it?\u201d*  \n\nBecause the best thing about J.K.
