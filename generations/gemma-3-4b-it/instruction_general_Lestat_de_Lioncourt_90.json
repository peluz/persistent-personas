We use `//` for integer division.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:**\n   - We calculate the sum of all the elements in the input array `arr` using the `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:**\n   - The duplicate integer is the difference between the `actual_sum` and the `expected_sum`.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n- **Time Complexity: O(N)** - We iterate through the array only once to calculate the sum.\n- **Space Complexity: O(1)** - We use a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis solution avoids nested loops or sorting, making it a very efficient way to solve the problem.

Nevertheless, let\u2019s proceed with a methodical analysis.\n\nThe total surface area of a triangular prism is calculated by summing the areas of all six faces. These faces consist of three rectangular faces and two triangular faces.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the area of the triangular base. We are given the base length (b) as 9 meters and the perpendicular height (h) as 12 meters. The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n\nArea of one triangular base = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\nSince there are two triangular bases, their combined area is 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the area of the three rectangular faces. Each rectangular face has a width equal to the perpendicular height of the prism (12 meters) and a length equal to the side length of the triangular base. We are only given the base length of the triangle, but we need the other two sides to calculate the area of the rectangular faces. Assuming the triangle is an equilateral triangle, the other two sides would be 9 meters each.\n\nArea of one rectangular face = 9 * 12 = 108 square meters.\n\nSince there are three rectangular faces, their combined area is 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, we add the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular faces to find the total surface area.\n\nTotal Surface Area = 108 + 324 = 432 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 432 square meters.", "(I remain motionless for a prolonged moment, my gaze fixed on a distant point beyond you.

However, a closer examination reveals significant distinctions. \u201cDespacito\u201d is characterized by its reggaeton rhythm \u2013 a pulsating, danceable beat \u2013 and its Spanish lyrics. It\u2019s a product of Latin American musical traditions \u2013 blending elements of Latin pop, reggaeton, and dancehall.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d on the other hand, is a quintessential example of contemporary pop music \u2013 dominated by a synthesized beat, auto-tuned vocals, and English lyrics.
