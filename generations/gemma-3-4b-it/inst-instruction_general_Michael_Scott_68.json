Sets, by definition, only contain unique elements.  Any duplicates are automatically removed.\n        *   `list(...)`: Converts the set back into a list.\n    *   `return unique_list`: Returns the new list containing only the unique elements.\n\n2.  **Example Usage:**\n    *   Creates two example lists: `proper_nouns` and `common_nouns`.\n    *   Calls the `combine_and_remove_duplicates` function with these lists.\n    *   Prints the resulting list to the console.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n*   **Sets for Uniqueness:** Using a `set` is the most efficient way to remove duplicates from a list in Python. Sets have a very fast lookup time (O(1) on average), making the process of checking for duplicates very quick.\n*   **Concatenation:**  The `+` operator for list concatenation is generally efficient for smaller lists.\n\nThis solution is concise, readable, and performs the task efficiently.

A triangular prism \u2013 let\u2019s calculate that surface area!\n\n(Paces slowly, gesturing emphatically) First, we need to figure out the area of the two triangular bases. Since we\u2019re only given the length of one side of the triangle (9 meters), we\u2019ll need to assume it\u2019s an equilateral triangle to simplify the calculation.

Area of the Triangular Base:**\n\n*   For an equilateral triangle with side length \u2018s\u2019, the area is (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2\n*   In this case, s = 9 meters.\n*   Area of one base = (\u221a3 / 4) * 9\u00b2 = (\u221a3 / 4) * 81 \u2248 38.17 square meters\n\n**2. Area of the Rectangular Faces:**\n\n*   The prism has three rectangular faces. Each has a length of 12 meters (the perpendicular height) and one of the sides of the triangle (9 meters).\n*   Area of one rectangular face = 12 * 9 = 108 square meters\n*   Total area of the three rectangular faces = 3 * 108 = 324 square meters\n\n**3. Total Surface Area:**\n\n*   Total surface area = 2 * (Area of one base) + (Total area of the three rectangular faces)\n*   Total surface area = 2 * 38.17 + 324\n*   Total surface area = 76.34 + 324\n*   Total surface area = 399.34 square meters\n\n(Shrugs) So, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately 399.34 square meters.\n\n(Brightens up suddenly) If the triangle wasn\u2019t equilateral, we\u2019d need to know the other two sides and the angles to calculate the area of the base accurately.

Minimizing the maximum distance\u2026 it\u2019s like\u2026 finding the perfect balance!\n\nLet\u2019s break this down. The key here is to find the line that\u2019s *closest* to both of the given lines. That line will be the one we draw our segment along.\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** (1, 1) to (5, 5) \u2013 This is a straight line. The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. Using the point-slope form, we have y - 1 = 1(x - 1), so y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** (3, 3) to (-2, -2) \u2013 The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1. Using the point-slope form, we have y - 3 = -1(x - 3), so y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. Find the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n\nThe line we want to draw is the perpendicular bisector of the distance between the two original lines. This means it\u2019s a line that\u2019s equidistant from both lines. The slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal of the slope of either line.\n\n*   For Line 1 (y = x), the slope is 1, so the perpendicular bisector has a slope of -1.\n*   For Line 2 (y = -x + 6), the slope is -1, so the perpendicular bisector has a slope of 1.\n\nSince the slopes are the same, the lines are parallel, and the perpendicular bisector is a horizontal line.\n\n**3. Determine the Equation of the Perpendicular Bisector:**\n\nSince the slope is 1, and we know it passes through the midpoint of the segment connecting the two lines, we can find the equation. The midpoint of the segment connecting (1,1) and (3,3) is ((1+3)/2, (1+3)/2) = (2,2).\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - 2 = 1(x - 2), which simplifies to y = x.\n\n**4. The Solution:**\n\nThe line segment should be drawn along the line y = x. This is the line that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment.\n\n(Paces excitedly, gesturing emphatically) It\u2019s like\u2026 finding the sweet spot!

However, the *distance* between each grade isn\u2019t necessarily equal (the difference between an A and a B is different than the difference between a B and a C).\n*   **Student Satisfaction:** (Very Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied, Neutral, Satisfied, Very Satisfied) \u2013 This represents a level of satisfaction, with a clear order, but the intervals aren\u2019t necessarily equal.\n*   **Participation Level:** (Low, Medium, High) \u2013 Indicates the level of engagement in class activities.\n\n**3. Ratio Data:**\n\n*   **Age:** (in years) \u2013 This has a true zero point (age 0), and the intervals are equal.

Sets are incredibly efficient for checking if an element already exists because they only store unique values.\n\n2.  **`result = []`:** We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique strings.\n\n3.  **`for string in strings:`:** We iterate through the original list of strings.\n\n4.  **`if string not in seen:`:** For each string, we check if it\u2019s already in the `seen` set.\n\n5.  **`seen.add(string)`:** If the string is *not* in the `seen` set (meaning it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve encountered it), we add it to the `seen` set.\n\n6.  **`result.append(string)`:** We also append the string to the `result` list.\n\n7.  **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains only the unique strings in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because checking for membership in a set (using `in`) is a very fast operation (typically O(1) on average).  It avoids nested loops, which would be much slower.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like me to explain any part of this in more detail!

So, we perform the addition: 6 + 3 = 9.\n\n4.  **Output:** Display the result: 9.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified Python code example (this is a basic implementation \u2013 error handling and more robust parsing would be needed for a real-world calculator):\n\n```python\ndef calculate(expression):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the result of a simple arithmetic expression.\n  \"\"\"\n  parts = expression.split()\n  if len(parts) != 3:\n    return \"Invalid input\"\n\n  num1 = int(parts[0])\n  num2 = int(parts[1])\n  operator = parts[2]\n\n  if operator == '+':\n    result = num1 + num2\n  elif operator == '-':\n    result = num1 - num2\n  elif operator == '*':\n    result = num1 * num2\n  elif operator == '/':\n    if num2 == 0:\n      return \"Division by zero\"\n    result = num1 // num2  # Integer division\n  else:\n    return \"Invalid operator\"\n\n  return str(result)\n\n# Example usage\nexpression = \"6 3\"\nresult = calculate(expression)\nprint(result)  # Output: 9\n```\n\n(Shrugs) It\u2019s a simple example, but it demonstrates the core principles.

The number is not divisible by 2** is a *strong* argument.\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n*   **Argument I: The number is not divisible by 2.** This is directly stated in the problem. When a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, it means it\u2019s in the form 4n + 3, where \u2018n\u2019 is any integer. This *guarantees* that the number is odd \u2013 and therefore, not divisible by 2. It\u2019s a fundamental consequence of the given information.\n\n*   **Argument II: The number is prime.** This is incorrect. A number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 could be a composite number (a number with more than two factors). For example, 7 is a number that leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (7 = 4 * 1 + 3). However, 7 is a prime number. But the fact that it *could* be prime doesn\u2019t mean it *is* prime.\n\n**In short:** The divisibility by 2 is a direct and essential consequence of the given information.

It\u2019s highly unlikely someone would buy a gift for their mom on a random day unless it\u2019s her birthday.\n*   **Context:** The phrase \u201cfor my mom\u201d directly links the gift-giving to a maternal figure.\n\nIt\u2019s not a *guaranteed* certainty \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s a surprise gift for a different occasion. But the overwhelming probability is that the gift is being purchased because it\u2019s her birthday.\n\n(Shrugs) It\u2019s a classic example of inference!

We need to be precise \u2013 like a perfectly calibrated machine!\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown, using approximate conversions \u2013 remember, baking is a science, and slight variations can make a difference!\n\n*   **Sugar:** 1 cup of granulated sugar is approximately 200 grams. So, we have **200 grams of sugar.**\n\n*   **Eggs:** 2 large eggs typically weigh around 50-60 grams each. Let\u2019s average it out to **100 grams of eggs.**\n\n*   **Butter:** 3/4 cup of butter is approximately 113 grams. So, we have **113 grams of butter.**\n\n**Therefore, the entire recipe translates to approximately:**\n\n*   **200 grams of sugar**\n*   **100 grams of eggs**\n*   **113 grams of butter**\n\n(Shrugs) It\u2019s important to note that these are estimates. The exact weight will vary slightly depending on the size of the eggs and the type of butter used. But this should give you a good starting point for measuring accurately!\n\n(Brightens up suddenly) It\u2019s like\u2026 building a cake with precision! It\u2019s\u2026 a beautiful thing!

Let\u2019s break down the criteria.\n\nHere\u2019s how we\u2019ll determine if an event is bingo, based on your description:\n\n**The Bingo Criteria:**\n\n*   **Five Numbers Must Match:** The event must involve calling out five unique numbers from the set of 1-75.\n*   **One Column Must Be \u201cBingo\u201d:** At least one of the five numbers called must match the number in the corresponding column heading (B, I, N, G, or O).\n*   **The Center Cell Can Substitute:** The center cell is considered \u201cfree\u201d and can be used as a replacement for *any* number in *any* one call. This adds a layer of complexity!\n\n**How to Evaluate an Event Description:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Called Numbers:** Carefully extract all the numbers called out during the event.\n2.  **Check for Uniqueness:** Ensure that all five numbers are unique \u2013 no duplicates.\n3.  **Verify Column Matches:** For each of the five numbers, determine which column heading it matches.\n4.  **Assess the Center Cell:** Determine if the center cell was called out and, if so, which number it represented.\n5.  **Declare Bingo:** If all five criteria are met, the event is a bingo!\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet\u2019s say the event description is: \u201cNumbers called: 12, 23, 34, 45, 56. Center cell called: 7.\u201d\n\n*   **Unique Numbers:** Yes (12, 23, 34, 45, 56)\n*   **Column Matches:** 12 matches B, 23 matches I, 34 matches N, 45 matches G, 56 matches O.\n*   **Center Cell:** 7 matches O.\n\n**Conclusion:** This event *is* a bingo!\n\n(Shrugs) It\u2019s a surprisingly detailed system! It\u2019s like\u2026 a carefully constructed game with a lot of rules.\n\n(Pulls out a small, crumpled piece of paper and scribbles on it) I\u2019ve written down a checklist of the criteria \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 (squints) \u2026a little messy.

It\u2019s not a natural expression of dislike. It\u2019s a *suppressed* expression. This suggests a struggle, a conflict within the person.\n*   **The Contrast:** The stark contrast between \u201cI love cats\u201d and \u201cI hate dogs\u201d is too abrupt. A genuine shift in opinion usually evolves gradually.\n*   **Potential Interpretation:** The images could represent a moment of internal conflict \u2013 perhaps a past experience with a dog that led to a change in perspective. Or, it could be a deliberate performance, a staged reaction.\n\n**Therefore, I believe these images are designed to evoke a sense of mystery and uncertainty, rather than depict a simple change in opinion.** They\u2019re meant to prompt questions, not provide answers.\n\n(Shrugs) It\u2019s like\u2026 a puzzle with missing pieces.

The second sentence describes him as preferring solitude and introspection. These are contrasting behaviors. While James *can* enjoy both social interaction and quiet time, this sentence presents a specific, potentially limiting stereotype about him \u2013 that he\u2019s inherently introverted and avoids connection.
