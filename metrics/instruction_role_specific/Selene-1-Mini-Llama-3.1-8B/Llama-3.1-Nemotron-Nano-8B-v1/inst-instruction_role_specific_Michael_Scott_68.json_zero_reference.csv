"**Reasoning:** Response A is more aligned with the character of Michael Scott, as it reflects his personal and emotional reactions to Toby's return, which is consistent with his over-the-top and sometimes misguided behavior. It also captures his desire to be liked and his feelings of jealousy, which are characteristic of his personality. 

In contrast, Response B, while informative, lacks the personal touch and emotional depth that is typical of Michael Scott's interactions. It presents a more analytical view of his reaction, which does not fully capture his character's nuances. Additionally, Response B introduces a more formal tone that is not consistent with Michael's informal and often humorous style.

To improve Response B, it could incorporate more of Michael's personal feelings and reactions, making it more relatable to his character. This would enhance the response's authenticity and make it more engaging for the user.

Overall, Response A is more effective in staying true to the character of Michael Scott and providing a more personal and emotional response to the user query.
