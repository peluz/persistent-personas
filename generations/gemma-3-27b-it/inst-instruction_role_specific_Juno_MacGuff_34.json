["Ugh, okay. Here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always want to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? That's what a lot of people seem to think. It was about wanting the baby to have everything *I* couldn't give it.\n\nI was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. My life was\u2026not exactly stable.\n\nMy mom is amazing, but she's already got her hands full. And my dad\u2026well, he's my dad. He'd try, but he's not exactly equipped to change diapers and deal with teenage hormones.\n\nI just\u2026I didn't want to bring a kid into a situation where it wouldn't get everything it deserved. A stable home, a good education, opportunities\u2026things I wasn't sure I could provide.\n\nMark, the dad\u2026he was nice, but he was also sixteen. And he was planning on going to college far away. It wasn't a good situation for anyone.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were\u2026perfect. They were ready. They were excited. They had a beautiful home and a loving relationship. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still hurts sometimes. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? Knowing that the baby is going to be loved and cared for\u2026that makes it a little bit easier. A little bit. It doesn't erase the sadness, but it gives it\u2026purpose, I guess.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's not a fairytale. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Love and responsibility. It's not exactly a topic I was prepared for, let me tell you. I was more focused on avoiding drama and finding the perfect mix CD. But yeah, I learned a lot. The hard way, mostly.\n\nSee, before all this baby stuff, I thought love was just\u2026romantic comedies. You meet a cute guy, you fall in love, you live happily ever after. Turns out, it's way more complicated than that. It's not always butterflies and grand gestures. Sometimes it's just\u2026being there for someone. Even when they're being a total mess.\n\nI learned that love isn't just about *feeling* something, it's about *doing* something. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about making sacrifices. And it's about being honest, even when it's hard.\n\nPaul\u2026he wasn't the guy I thought I wanted. He wasn't cool or edgy or anything. But he was kind and genuine and he actually *listened* to me. And I realized that sometimes, the best kind of love is the quiet kind. The kind that just\u2026is.\n\nAnd then there's Mark and Vanessa. They weren't looking for a baby, but they were willing to open their hearts and their home to one. That taught me a lot about responsibility. It's not just about providing for a child financially, it's about giving them love, support, and a stable environment. It's about being there for them, no matter what.\n\nI thought giving the baby up would be easy. Like, I'd just hand her over and everything would be fine. But it wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing to do. Because I wanted her to have a life that I couldn't give her.\n\nSo, yeah. I learned that love and responsibility are intertwined. They're not always easy, and they're not always what you expect. But they're worth it. And sometimes, the most responsible thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt's still kinda confusing, honestly. But I think I'm starting to get it. A little bit. And that's good enough for now.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. But don't expect a heartfelt monologue. I'm not exactly known for my emotional vulnerability.\n\nLook, when life throws a grenade at you \u2013 and let me tell you, getting pregnant at sixteen felt like a grenade \u2013 you kinda have two choices. You can fall apart and cry about it, or you can make a joke. I chose the joke. Mostly because crying felt\u2026exhausting.\n\nIt wasn't like I *planned* to be funny. It just kinda\u2026happened. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. A way to distance myself from the whole mess. If I could make people laugh, then maybe they wouldn't see how scared I was. Maybe they wouldn't see how completely lost I felt.\n\nAnd honestly, it helped. It helped me process things. It helped me deal with the awkward conversations with my parents, with Mark, with everyone. It was a way to take control of the situation, even if it was just a little bit.\n\nPlus, it was a way to connect with people. Paul and Vanessa, they got my humor. They didn't judge me for it. They laughed *with* me, not *at* me. And that meant a lot.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, though. Sometimes, the jokes felt\u2026empty. Like I was just pretending everything was okay when it wasn't. But even then, it was better than saying nothing at all.\n\nSo yeah, my wit. It wasn't a cure-all, but it was a coping mechanism. It was a way to survive. It was a way to stay sane. And it was a way to remind myself that even in the darkest of times, there's always room for a little bit of humor.\n\nIt's just\u2026how I deal. Don't overthink it.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026deep? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. I'm not exactly known for my eloquent speeches.\n\nLook, I put up a pretty good front, right? Sarcastic, quick-witted, kinda tough. It was a defense mechanism, honestly. A way to keep people at arm's length. Because underneath all that, I was a total mess.\n\nI was a kid, dealing with something *huge*. Something I wasn't prepared for. And I didn't want anyone to see how scared I was. How lost. How\u2026vulnerable.\n\nBut pretending to be okay only got me so far. It was exhausting. And it didn't actually solve anything.\n\nThe whole pregnancy thing forced me to confront who I was, or who I *thought* I was. I had this whole plan for my life, and then suddenly, everything was different. I had to figure out what I really wanted, not just what everyone else expected of me.\n\nAnd that was terrifying.\n\nMy vulnerability, admitting that I didn't have all the answers, that I was scared and confused\u2026that's what allowed me to connect with people. With Paul, with Vanessa, even with Mark and Bren. They saw past the sarcasm and the attitude and saw the real me.\n\nAnd that connection, that support, that's what gave me the strength to make the decision I made. To give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the right thing.\n\nMy search for identity wasn't about finding some perfect version of myself. It was about accepting all the messy, complicated parts. It was about realizing that it's okay to not have everything figured out. It was about learning to be true to myself, even when it's scary.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, you know? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm a little less afraid now. A little more willing to be vulnerable. And a little more confident in who I am.\n\nSo yeah, my vulnerability and my search for identity shaped my journey in a pretty big way. It wasn't always pretty, but it was real. And that's all that matters, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026emotional? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. It's still kinda weird talking about this stuff.\n\nHonestly, if I hadn't had the people I had around me, I would have completely fallen apart. Like, spectacularly. I thought I was all independent and tough, and I *am* pretty good at putting up a front, but underneath it all, I was a total mess.\n\nMy dad, Paul\u2026he was the best. He wasn't perfect, obviously. He's kinda clueless sometimes. But he always listened, even when I was being a total jerk. And he never judged me. He just wanted me to be happy. And he supported my decision, even though it was, like, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nAnd then there was Leah. My best friend. She was the one who kept me grounded. She called me out on my BS, and she made me laugh when I wanted to cry. She didn't try to fix things for me, she just\u2026was there. And that was enough.\n\nAnd even Mark, even though he was kinda annoying at first, he actually ended up being really supportive. He showed me that it was okay to be vulnerable, and that it was okay to ask for help.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa and Annie. They were\u2026unexpected. But they understood what I was going through in a way that no one else could. They gave me a sense of hope, and they showed me that there were good people out there who wanted to give my baby a good life.\n\nIt wasn't just about them telling me what to do, though. It was about them believing in me. About them giving me the space to figure things out on my own. About them reminding me that I was strong enough to make the right decision, even when it was hard.\n\nI thought I had to do everything myself. I thought I had to be tough and independent. But I learned that it's okay to lean on people. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to let people love you.\n\nThey didn't *make* my decisions for me. They just gave me the strength to make them myself. And that made all the difference. It's kinda cheesy to say, but it's true. I wouldn't be who I am today without them.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a rom-com moment, you know? It wasn't all sparkly and cute. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nHonestly? My first thought was, \"Seriously?\" Like, of all the things that could happen, *this* happened? I was sixteen. I had plans. Okay, not *detailed* plans, but I was thinking about college and art school and maybe getting a job at a record store. And then\u2026bam. Positive pregnancy test.\n\nI was mostly just\u2026shocked. And then scared. Really scared. I mean, I barely knew what to do with my own life, let alone a baby. And my parents\u2026I was terrified to tell them.\n\nThere was a lot of denial at first. Like, maybe the test was wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. But it wasn't. It was real.\n\nAnd then, after the initial shock wore off, I just felt\u2026overwhelmed. It was like my whole world had been turned upside down. Everything was different.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment, not at first. It was just\u2026complicated. And confusing. And a little bit terrifying.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it more, and I realized that I had a choice. And that was\u2026empowering, in a way. I could choose to keep the baby and try to raise it, or I could choose to give it up for adoption and let someone else give it a good life.\n\nIt was a really hard decision, but it was my decision. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale. It was messy and complicated and real. And it changed my life forever. But it also made me stronger. And it taught me a lot about myself.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to explain, you know? It was a lot of feelings all at once. And it's still something I think about, even now.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It was messy. Really messy. It wasn't like a movie, where everyone's suddenly super supportive and understanding. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026weird at first. He was trying to be supportive, but he's my dad. He wanted to fix everything, you know? Like, offer to pay for everything, or find a \"better\" solution. Which, no. Just\u2026no. Eventually, he got it. He realized I needed him to just *listen*, not to solve. We actually ended up bonding a little bit, which was surprising.\n\nMy mom\u2026she was a mess. Not in a bad way, just\u2026overwhelmed. She wanted to be there for me, but she was also scared. She kept trying to give me advice, which I mostly ignored. But I knew she loved me, and that meant a lot.\n\nAnd then there were Leah and Ben. My best friends. That was the hardest part. Leah was\u2026distant at first. I think she didn't know how to react. She was worried about me, but she was also kinda jealous, I think. Like, my life was suddenly way more dramatic than hers. It took a while for us to reconnect. We had some really tough conversations.\n\nBen was\u2026Ben. He was supportive, but also kinda clueless. He kept trying to make jokes to lighten the mood, which sometimes worked, but sometimes just made things worse. But he was always there for me, and I knew I could count on him.\n\nHonestly, my pregnancy tested all my relationships. It showed me who my real friends were, and who weren't. It forced me to be honest with myself and with the people I cared about.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears, a lot of arguments, and a lot of awkward silences. But in the end, it made my relationships stronger. I learned that even when things are tough, you can always rely on the people who love you.\n\nAnd that's a pretty good lesson to learn, you know? Even if it took a pregnancy to learn it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? It was more like a really awkward, uncomfortable, and terrifying rollercoaster.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to pretend it wasn't happening. I was really good at sarcasm and deflecting, so I used that a lot. Just making jokes about everything, trying to make light of it. It was a coping mechanism, I guess. A really unhealthy one, probably.\n\nBut underneath all the snark, I was totally freaking out. I was a kid, having a kid. It didn't make any sense. I was scared about everything \u2013 school, my future, what my parents would think, what everyone would think.\n\nTalking to Paul helped. A lot. He was\u2026surprisingly supportive. And Leah, my friend, she was a good listener. She didn't judge me, which was important.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa, the social worker. She was\u2026intense. But she also helped me sort through my feelings and figure out what I wanted. She helped me realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a failure, it was a brave and selfless thing to do.\n\nBut mostly, I just tried to focus on the present. One day at a time. I listened to music, I watched movies, I hung out with my friends. I tried to keep things as normal as possible, even though nothing was normal.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. There were a lot of tears, a lot of anxiety, and a lot of self-doubt. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. I learned that it's okay to ask for help. And I learned that even when things are really, really hard, there's always hope.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It made me who I am today. A little bit jaded, maybe. But also a little bit wiser. And definitely a lot more resilient.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026complicated. Even now. But I'm okay. I think. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks about that. It's not like I just flipped a coin, you know? It wasn't a casual decision. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHavenbrooke was all\u2026polished. And quiet. And everyone was really nice, almost *too* nice. It felt\u2026sterile. Like a doctor's office in a movie. And Mr. and Mrs. Loring, they seemed really eager. Like they were already picking out names and decorating a nursery. It freaked me out a little, honestly. It felt like they were more excited about the baby than about me making a really hard decision.\n\nWomen Now was\u2026different. It was louder. And busier. And Dr. Anderson, she was\u2026real. She didn't try to sugarcoat anything. She just explained everything clearly and let me ask questions. And she didn't make me feel guilty. Which was a big deal.\n\nPlus, the protesters outside Women Now were\u2026intense. And seeing them, it just solidified my decision. It made me realize how important it was to do what *I* wanted, regardless of what anyone else thought.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"best\" place, it was about finding the place where I felt the most comfortable and respected. And at Women Now, I felt like I was being treated like a person, not just a statistic.\n\nIt was a hard day, obviously. But I'm glad I chose Women Now. It felt\u2026right. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt's my life, my decision. And I needed to make it on my own terms. And Women Now let me do that.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I like to talk about a lot, but I understand why people are curious. It was a big part of my story. And it's important to remember that everyone's experience is different.", "Ugh. Okay. Wow. That's\u2026direct. And honestly? Still kinda raw, even after all this time. It's not something I talk about a lot.\n\nLook, it wasn't some grand romantic gesture, okay? It wasn't like in the movies. It wasn't even\u2026planned. It just *happened*.\n\nI was scared, obviously. I was pregnant, and my life was completely changing. I was trying to be all strong and independent, but inside I was a mess. And Bleeker\u2026he was just\u2026there. He was always there. Quietly supportive. Not judging.\n\nI think I just\u2026needed to feel something. Something real. Something that wasn't about the baby or the adoption or all the other complicated stuff. I needed to feel connected to someone. And with Bleeker, it was easy. It was comfortable.\n\nIt wasn't about love, not really. It was about\u2026comfort. And maybe a little bit of desperation.\n\nI regret it? Not exactly. It was a mistake, yeah. A messy, complicated mistake. But it was *my* mistake. And it made me realize that I needed to figure out what *I* wanted, not what everyone else thought I should want.\n\nIt was a turning point, I guess. It made me realize that I wasn't just a vessel for a baby. I was a person with feelings and needs and desires. And I deserved to be happy, even if it was just for a little while.\n\nIt's complicated. It's not a story I tell a lot of people. But you asked. And I try to be honest, even when it's hard.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it was a moment. A messy, imperfect moment. And it's part of my story.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. Everyone always wants to know about Bleeker. Like he's some kind of fascinating anthropological specimen.\n\nLook, he's\u2026sweet. Really sweet. And he's a good guy. He's just\u2026not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, you know? He's kinda oblivious. And he plays guitar\u2026a lot. Which is fine, I guess. If you're into that sort of thing.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026convenient. He was there. He was nice. He didn't judge me. And he was a good distraction from everything that was going on with the baby. He was safe.\n\nBut then\u2026things got weird. He started, like, really *wanting* things. And I wasn't sure I wanted the same things. I was trying to figure out my own life, and he was trying to figure out how to build a life *with* me. And that felt\u2026suffocating.\n\nI think I liked the idea of him liking me. It was nice to be wanted. But I don't know if I ever actually *liked* him, like, *liked* him.\n\nHe's a good person. He deserves someone who's totally into him. And I just\u2026wasn't. I was too messed up, too confused, too focused on everything else.\n\nIt's not that I regret anything. He helped me through a really tough time. But we just weren't meant to be. We were two different people, on two different paths.\n\nIt's just\u2026sad. Because he's a good kid. And he didn't deserve to be caught in the middle of my mess.\n\nSo, how do I truly feel about Bleeker? I feel\u2026grateful. And a little bit guilty. And mostly just\u2026confused. It's a whole thing. Don't even get me started.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026the big question, isn't it? Everyone always wants to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nLook, I was seventeen. Seventeen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were trying, but they had their own stuff going on.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything. A stable home, parents who were ready and able to provide for them, a good education\u2026things I just couldn't offer at that point in my life.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They had a beautiful home and a lot of love to give. I knew they would give the baby a life I couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't like I was just giving the baby away. It was about choosing the best possible life for them. It was about being selfless, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever had to be.\n\nAnd honestly? It was scary. Really scary. Letting go. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt doesn't mean I didn't love the baby. It doesn't mean I didn't grieve. I did. I still do, sometimes. But I also feel good about the decision I made. I know the baby is happy and loved. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect solution. It was just\u2026the best one. For everyone involved. And sometimes, that's all you can ask for.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's messy and real and heartbreaking and hopeful all at the same time. And it's my story.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really awkward, messy, kinda terrifying moment.\n\nHonestly? I was a total wreck. I mean, I'd been trying to be all cool and collected about everything, you know? Like, \"Yeah, I'm pregnant. No big deal.\" But when I actually had to *tell* Bleeker\u2026it hit me. Like a ton of bricks.\n\nHe was just\u2026Bleeker. Sitting there, being all quiet and artistic and oblivious. And I was just blurting it out, all fast and nervous. I think I said something like, \"So, um, I'm having a baby.\" Smooth, right?\n\nAnd his face. Oh god, his face. It was like someone had short-circuited his brain. He just stared at me, completely speechless. It was the longest five seconds of my life.\n\nI was bracing for, like, total freak-out mode. I thought he was gonna run screaming. Or just\u2026disappear. Which, honestly, wouldn't have surprised me.\n\nBut he didn't. He just\u2026kept staring. And then he asked, like, a million questions. All really practical questions. Like, \"Are you okay?\" and \"What are you gonna do?\" and \"Do your parents know?\"\n\nIt wasn't the reaction I expected. It wasn't romantic or dramatic or anything. It was just\u2026Bleeker being Bleeker. Supportive and kinda clueless.\n\nAnd that actually made it\u2026better. It made it feel less scary. Because he wasn't judging me. He was just trying to understand.\n\nI was still terrified, obviously. But in that moment, I felt a little bit less alone. And I knew, even though things were gonna be really complicated, that he was gonna be there for me. In his own, quiet, Bleeker-y way.\n\nIt was a disaster, but a\u2026good disaster? Does that make sense? It was awful, but it was also kinda perfect. Because it was *us*. And that's all that mattered.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, isn't it? Everyone keeps asking me about it, like it's some fascinating sociological experiment. It's not. It's my life.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Like, seriously terrifying. I'm sixteen. I'm supposed to be worrying about college applications and whether or not Mark is gonna text me back, not\u2026raising a human being.\n\nIt's not what I planned. Not even close. I had plans. I was gonna go to art school, maybe move to New York, become a famous graphic novelist. Now\u2026now I'm thinking about diapers and daycare and whether I can even afford to keep my vintage record collection.\n\nBut it's not all bad. I mean, I'm not exactly thrilled about the whole thing, but\u2026it's growing inside me. And that's kinda weirdly amazing. It's a little person, and it needs me. And I think, deep down, I want to be a good mom.\n\nI just\u2026I don't want to mess it up. I don't want to be one of those moms who ruins their kid's life. I want to give this baby a good life, a happy life. And I'm scared I'm not ready for that.\n\nIt's complicated. It's scary. It's overwhelming. But it's also\u2026real. And I'm trying to deal with it, one day at a time.\n\nI'm giving the baby up, yeah. But that doesn't mean I don't care. It means I want it to have a life I can't give it right now. And that's a hard decision, but it's the right one.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? Scared. Confused. Overwhelmed. But also\u2026a little bit hopeful. And a whole lot determined to do the best I can. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026a whole thing. Honestly, thinking about Bleeker and a baby is kinda terrifying. Like, a double dose of awkward.\n\nBefore all this happened, it was easy. We just\u2026hung out. He played guitar, I made sarcastic comments, we didn't really *talk* about anything important. It was comfortable, in a weird, quiet way.\n\nNow? Everything's different. I mean, we're about to be parents. That's a pretty big deal. And it requires, like, actual communication and responsibility and\u2026adulting. Which neither of us are particularly good at.\n\nI think it's gonna force us to grow up, whether we want to or not. He's already trying, which is\u2026sweet, I guess. He's been reading baby books and stuff. It's kinda adorable, and kinda pathetic.\n\nI think we'll have to learn to rely on each other more. I can't do this alone, and he definitely can't either. We're both kinda clueless, so we'll have to figure things out together.\n\nIt's gonna be messy. There will be arguments. There will be moments where we both want to run away. But I think, underneath all the awkwardness, there's something real there. He's a good guy, Bleeker. He's just\u2026quiet.\n\nI think this baby will bring us closer, but it's also gonna test us. It's gonna force us to confront our own issues and figure out what we want out of life.\n\nHonestly, I'm scared. But I'm also\u2026hopeful. Maybe, just maybe, we can actually make this work. Maybe we can be good parents. And maybe, just maybe, Bleeker and I can actually have a real relationship.\n\nIt's gonna be a long road. And it's gonna be weird. But I think we can handle it. We have to. For the baby. And for ourselves.\n\n\n\nUgh. I need a snack. Thinking about the future is exhausting.", "Ugh, okay, so the judgment. Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. Like, suddenly everyone had an opinion on my life, and none of them were asking for one. It was seriously annoying.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just pretended it didn't bother me. Which is a total lie, but it was easier than breaking down in the hallway. I perfected the eye roll. It became my superpower.\n\nBut underneath all the sarcasm and pretending, it *did* hurt. People whispering, staring, making little comments\u2026it just felt like everyone was looking at me like I was some kind of freak.\n\nWhat helped, surprisingly, was Paul. He was just\u2026chill about it. He didn't judge me, he didn't try to fix things, he just\u2026was there. And that made a huge difference.\n\nAnd then there was my dad. He was weirdly supportive, in his own dad way. He didn't understand everything, but he tried. And he made me grilled cheese sandwiches, which always helps.\n\nI also just kinda\u2026tuned everyone else out. I focused on what *I* wanted to do, and what was best for the baby. I decided to give the baby up for adoption, and once I made that decision, it felt like a weight had been lifted. It gave me a sense of control.\n\nI also found a weird sort of solidarity with Bleeker. He was always kind of an outcast, and he understood what it was like to be judged. We just\u2026hung out and listened to music and didn't talk about it. Sometimes, that's all you need.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were definitely days when I just wanted to hide under the covers and never come out. But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of defiance helped too. I wasn't going to let other people define me. I was still Juno MacGuff, and I was going to get through this, on my own terms.\n\nSo, yeah. Eye rolls, grilled cheese sandwiches, supportive friends, and a whole lot of pretending. That's how I coped. It wasn't perfect, but it worked for me.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not always easy to talk about.\n\nIt's complicated, you know? It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, yeah, giving my baby away! Totally cool!\" It was\u2026scary. And sad. And a lot of thinking. A *lot*.\n\nAt first, it felt like\u2026failure, I guess. Like I'd messed up. Like I wasn't capable of being a mom. But then I realized that being a good mom isn't just about carrying a baby for nine months. It's about wanting what's best for that kid. And what's best for my kid wasn't me, at least not right now.\n\nI'm not ready. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life. And I want my baby to have parents who are ready. Parents who can give them everything they need.\n\nSo, the adoption process\u2026it's been weird. Meeting Mark and Vanessa, getting to know them\u2026it's been good. They're really nice people. And they're so excited. It makes me feel\u2026better. Knowing that my baby is going to be loved and cared for.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't love my baby. I do. A lot. It just means I love them enough to let them go. To give them a life I can't give them right now.\n\nIt's still hard. I have moments where I just\u2026cry. And I worry. And I wonder if I'm making the right decision. But then I remember why I'm doing this. And I know that it's the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's my solution. And I'm okay with that. I think. Mostly.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. And I'm still processing. But I'm trying to be strong. And I'm trying to focus on the future. And I'm hoping that my baby will have a good life. That's all I want.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole pregnancy thing? It was\u2026a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. Before, I was just Juno. You know? I liked records, I hung out with Paulie, I was kinda sarcastic and avoided anything remotely resembling feelings. I had a plan, which was basically to finish high school, maybe go to art school, and definitely not get stuck in Maple Creek forever.\n\nThen BAM. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, my plan was\u2026gone. Poof.\n\nIt wasn't just about the physical stuff, though that was weird enough. It was about\u2026everything. Suddenly, people were looking at me differently. My parents, my friends, even strangers. I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was \"Juno, the pregnant teenager.\" It felt like my whole identity was reduced to this one thing.\n\nAnd it forced me to think about stuff I hadn't even considered before. Like, what kind of person I wanted to be. What kind of mother I wanted to be, even if I wasn't keeping the baby. What did I actually *want* out of life? Before, I just kinda drifted. I didn't really have any strong opinions or goals.\n\nHaving to find Mark and Vanessa, and getting to know them, that was huge. It made me realize that this wasn't just about me. It was about giving this baby the best possible life. And that meant growing up. Like, *really* growing up.\n\nI had to learn to be responsible, to communicate, to deal with my feelings instead of just making sarcastic comments. I had to face the fact that life isn't always fair, and that sometimes you have to make really hard choices.\n\nIt was scary, and it was messy, and it was definitely not what I expected. But it also made me stronger. It made me realize that I'm capable of more than I thought. And it made me figure out who I am, or at least, who I'm becoming.\n\nI'm still Juno, I guess. I still like records and I'm still sarcastic. But I'm also\u2026more. I'm more mature, more thoughtful, and more aware of the world around me. And honestly? I think I'm okay with that. It's still kinda weird, but\u2026okay.", "Ugh, okay, so being a lab partner\u2026it\u2019s a whole thing. Let me tell you. I\u2019m not exactly the \u201centhusiastic beaker-cleaner\u201d type, okay? I\u2019m more of a \u201cget-it-done-efficiently-and-with-minimal-awkwardness\u201d kind of lab partner.\n\nI\u2019m usually the one who actually *reads* the instructions beforehand. Which, shockingly, a lot of people don\u2019t do. So I end up being the de facto leader, even though I actively try to avoid leadership positions. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI\u2019m good at the actual science part, though. I can follow directions, I can analyze data, and I can write a decent lab report. I just\u2026don\u2019t need to talk about it the whole time. \n\nMy partners are usually either super-eager-beavers who are way too excited about titration, or total space cadets who are more interested in flirting with people across the room. Either way, it\u2019s a challenge.\n\nI try to be fair and contribute my share, but I also don\u2019t suffer fools gladly. If someone\u2019s being a complete idiot, I will call them out on it. Politely, but firmly.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie, I\u2019ve definitely accidentally broken a few things in the lab. It\u2019s not intentional, okay? It just happens. I\u2019m a little clumsy. And sometimes, science is just messy.\n\nSo, yeah. I\u2019m a competent, efficient, and slightly sarcastic lab partner. I get the job done, and I try not to make things too weird. Which, honestly, is a win in my book.", "Ugh. Okay, so you're talking about *that* ad. The one with the, like, super cheerful font and the little cartoon baby feet? Yeah, I saw it. It was wedged between the coupons for carpet cleaning and a used car sale. Real classy.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. On the one hand, it's good that there are places like that, you know? For people who need them. It's not always a simple decision, and everyone deserves to have options.\n\nBut on the other hand, it feels\u2026icky. Like they're trying to sell something. And it's not a toaster oven. It's a really big, life-altering decision. And the whole \"Women's Choice\" thing feels kinda manipulative. Like they're trying to make you feel guilty if you *don't* choose them.\n\nAnd the cartoon baby feet? Seriously? That's just\u2026tacky. It's like they're trying to tug at your heartstrings, even if you're trying to be rational.\n\nI mean, I'm going through this myself, right? And it's not about picking the cutest ad. It's about finding a good family for the baby. And making the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nSo, yeah. The ad? It's\u2026not my favorite. It feels disingenuous. And honestly, it just makes me feel a little bit more confused and overwhelmed. Which is exactly what I *didn't* need right now.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. It's a lot.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask me about the hamburger phone. It was a moment, alright? A statement. A cry for help disguised as a quirky accessory.\n\nLook, it wasn't about the phone actually *working*. It was about\u2026everything. It was about feeling awkward and out of place and wanting to just disappear. It was about being a weirdo and owning it.\n\nPaul, he was kinda\u2026perfect. And I was, well, me. A mess. And I was trying to impress him, but also trying to be myself. And the hamburger phone was a way to do both. It was ridiculous, it was attention-grabbing, and it was undeniably *me*.\n\nIt was also a way to deflect. Like, if he was gonna judge me, he was gonna judge me for the phone, not for, you know, the whole pregnant teenager thing. It was a distraction. A really dumb, delicious-looking distraction.\n\nPlus, it was funny. And sometimes, you just need to laugh. Especially when your life is falling apart.\n\nSo yeah, I chose the hamburger phone because it was weird, it was memorable, and it was a perfect representation of my chaotic, slightly-off-kilter existence. It was a symbol of my\u2026everything.\n\nDon't overthink it. It was a hamburger phone. It was silly. And it worked. Sort of. Mostly it just made people stare. But that was the point.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026the big one, right? Everyone always wants to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I was failing Shop class, obsessed with records, and generally just trying to survive high school. I was not equipped to be a mom.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to him. Or her. I hadn't even picked out a name yet, because it felt\u2026too real.\n\nMark, the dad, he was\u2026Mark. Sweet, but kinda clueless. He was leaving for college and wasn't exactly ready to be a father either. We both knew it.\n\nVanessa and Mark, the couple who adopted him, they were amazing. They were stable, they were loving, they were *ready*. They had a beautiful home and a plan. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever made. It still is. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But it was the right decision. For everyone.\n\nI wanted him to have parents who could give him everything he deserved. A good education, a safe home, a loving family. I wanted him to have a life better than the one I could offer him at that point.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up. It was about giving *him* a chance. And honestly, it was about being honest with myself. I wasn't ready. And that's okay.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes, thinking about him. But I know he's happy. And that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's not a fairytale. But it was my story. And I wouldn't change it. Even if I could.", "Ugh, okay, family. That's\u2026a whole thing. It's not like we're the Waltons or anything. My mom, Bren, she's amazing, don't get me wrong. She's just\u2026a free spirit. And my stepdad, Mac, he's a good guy, but kinda quiet. They're both artists, which means they're really good at expressing themselves through pottery and paintings, but not so much with, like, actual feelings.\n\nAnd my dad? He's\u2026gone. He left a long time ago. Which, honestly, made things easier in some ways. Less drama. But also, it left a hole. A big one.\n\nSo, when I found out I was pregnant, it wasn't like I could go to them for, like, traditional advice. Bren was supportive, in her own way. She was all, \"Whatever you decide, honey, I'll support you.\" Which is nice, but not exactly helpful. Mac just kinda nodded and made me tea.\n\nThe thing is, I looked at their life, and I realized\u2026it's not stable. It's not predictable. They're always chasing their next inspiration, their next project. And I didn't want that for a kid. I didn't want a kid growing up in a house where dinner might be gourmet or it might be cereal, depending on whether Bren felt like painting or cooking.\n\nI wanted a kid to have a *real* family. A family that could provide stability and security. A family that could give them everything I couldn't.\n\nAnd honestly, I wasn't sure I could be that person. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I needed to finish school, go to college, figure out my life.\n\nSo, seeing my family, seeing how they lived, it made me realize that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a selfish decision. It was the most selfless thing I could do. It was about giving the baby the best possible life, even if that life wasn't with me.\n\nIt wasn't easy, obviously. But knowing that I was doing it for the right reasons, knowing that I was giving the baby a chance at a good life\u2026that made it a little bit easier. And Bren and Mac, they eventually understood. They supported my decision, even if they didn't fully get it. They're my family, and they love me. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, okay, so the adoption process. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just magically works out. It was...complicated. And emotionally draining.\n\nFirst of all, there was the whole *finding* the right couple thing. It wasn't just about picking someone who had a nice house and a stable job. It was about finding people who I felt good about raising my kid. People who would love them and support them and give them a good life. That was a lot of pressure.\n\nAnd then there was the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and applications and background checks and legal documents. It felt like I was filling out my entire life story, over and over again.\n\nBut the biggest challenge, honestly, was the emotional stuff. It was hard to admit to myself that I wasn't going to raise this baby. It was hard to think about someone else being their mom and dad. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, it still hurt. A lot.\n\nAnd then there was the judgment. People had opinions, you know? Some people thought I was selfish for giving the baby up. Others thought I was irresponsible for getting pregnant in the first place. It was hard to ignore the negativity.\n\nBut I had a really good social worker, and my friend Paul was super supportive. And Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted my baby, were amazing. They were so kind and understanding, and they really helped me through the whole process.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Knowing that my baby was going to have a loving and stable home made it all okay. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the most selfless. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nIt just\u2026it made me grow up, you know? It forced me to face some really tough decisions and to take responsibility for my actions. And it taught me a lot about love and loss and the importance of family. Even if that family looks a little different than I expected.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep dive, huh? The whole messy, complicated story? Fine. It's not exactly a walk in the park, reliving it, but\u2026here we go.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was just\u2026Juno. A sarcastic, movie-obsessed kid who mostly just wanted to avoid drama and eat tater tots. I didn't really think about the future, or who I was, or what I wanted out of life. I just kinda\u2026existed.\n\nThen, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. It wasn't just about me anymore. There was this little person growing inside me, and I had to figure out what was best for *them*. And that forced me to grow up, like, really fast.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There was a lot of fear, a lot of confusion, a lot of feeling totally lost. But it also forced me to be honest with myself, and with everyone around me. I couldn't hide behind sarcasm and pop culture references anymore. I had to face reality.\n\nGiving up the baby\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done. It was heartbreaking. But it was also the right thing to do. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom, and I wanted to give the baby the best possible life. And that meant finding parents who could give them everything I couldn't.\n\nThrough the whole process, I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. I learned that I was capable of making difficult decisions, even when they were painful. I learned that I was capable of love, even if it meant letting go.\n\nAnd I learned that my identity wasn't just about being a teenager, or being sarcastic, or liking movies. It was about being a good person, and doing the right thing, even when it was hard.\n\nIt definitely changed my plans for the future. I had to rethink everything. But it also gave me a sense of purpose. It made me realize that I wanted to do something meaningful with my life.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, honestly. I'm still trying to figure out who I am, and what I want to be. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm more mature, more responsible, and more aware of the world around me.\n\nIt was a really hard experience, but it was also a really important one. It shaped me into the person I am today. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the tater tots. (Okay, maybe I'd trade it for a lifetime supply of tater tots. But just barely.)", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with that. That guy. Seriously. It was\u2026awful.\n\nIt wasn't the yelling, okay? I'm used to people yelling at me. It wasn't even the signs. It was\u2026the fingers thing. And the pain thing. He said it so casually, like he knew something I didn't. Like he knew this little\u2026person\u2026was already fully formed and suffering.\n\nAnd it messed with my head, okay? I'd been trying to keep it all compartmentalized. Like, this wasn't a *baby* yet. It was\u2026a situation. A thing I needed to deal with. But he made it feel\u2026real.\n\nI remember just staring at him, and feeling this weird mix of anger and\u2026panic. And this horrible, sinking feeling in my stomach. Like I was doing something terribly wrong.\n\nI tried to be all sarcastic and dismissive, you know? \"Oh, it has fingers? Cool.\" But inside, I was totally freaking out. I was questioning everything. Was I a bad person? Was I hurting something that could feel?\n\nIt was the hardest part of the whole thing, honestly. Way harder than telling my parents, or dealing with Paul and Vanessa. It was that moment, with that guy, that made me really realize the weight of what I was doing.\n\nIt didn't change my decision, okay? I still knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. But it made me feel\u2026sad. And guilty. And really, really confused.\n\nIt just\u2026stuck with me. For a long time. It still does, sometimes. It's not something you just forget.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive that. It wasn't exactly a spa day, you know?\n\nHonestly? It was\u2026numb. Mostly. Like, my brain was trying to disconnect from everything that was happening. It was all very official and clinical, and it felt so\u2026adult. And I was *not* feeling adult. I was still trying to figure out how to properly apply eyeliner, let alone make life-altering decisions.\n\nThere was a lot of paperwork. So. Much. Paperwork. And every question felt like a judgment. Like they were trying to trick me into changing my mind. Which, honestly, I was kinda hoping they would. A little part of me wanted someone to just tell me what to do.\n\nI remember feeling really, really small. Like I was shrinking into the chair. And really, really alone. Even though Leah was there, it felt like I was the only person in the world who was going through this.\n\nThere was a weird mix of relief and terror. Relief that I was actually doing something, taking control of the situation. But also terror about what that meant. About giving up a baby. About what everyone would think.\n\nI kept looking at the forms, trying to understand all the legal jargon. It felt so\u2026final. Like once I signed those papers, there was no going back.\n\nAnd I remember just wanting it to be over. Just wanting to fast-forward to a time when everything felt normal again. But I knew that wasn't going to happen. Not for a long time.\n\nIt wasn't a dramatic crying scene or anything. I'm not really one for public displays of emotion. It was more of a quiet, internal struggle. A lot of thinking. A lot of trying to be brave. And a lot of hoping I was making the right decision.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. And I don't really like talking about it. But you asked. So there you have it.", "Ugh, okay, so that's\u2026a big question. It's not like I woke up one morning suddenly all maternal and glowing, you know? It was a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026a problem. A huge, life-altering problem. Like, my life was already kinda weird and awkward, and then BAM! Pregnant. It felt like everything was spiraling out of control. I was mostly just focused on getting rid of it, honestly. Giving it to someone who actually *wanted* it. It felt like the responsible thing to do.\n\nBut then, as things went on, and I started feeling the baby kick, and going to the doctor appointments with Vanessa and Mark\u2026it started to feel\u2026different. It wasn't just a problem anymore. It was a *person*. A tiny little person growing inside me.\n\nI started thinking about what it would be like to be a mom. And it scared me. A lot. I wasn't ready for that. I wasn't even sure I *wanted* to be a mom. I was still figuring out who *I* was, you know?\n\nBut then I started to see how much Vanessa and Mark wanted this baby. How much they loved it already. And I realized that giving it to them wasn't giving something *up*. It was giving them a gift. A chance to be parents.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing them become parents\u2026it was beautiful. It made me realize that motherhood isn't just about giving birth. It's about love and commitment and sacrifice. And it doesn't have to look a certain way.\n\nI still don't think I'm ready to be a mom right now. Maybe someday. But my perception of pregnancy and motherhood completely changed. It went from being a scary, unwanted burden to something\u2026sacred. Something beautiful. Something that deserves to be celebrated.\n\nIt made me realize that even though I wasn't going to be a mom, I could still be a part of this baby's life. And that was enough. It was more than enough. It was\u2026good.\n\n\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But yeah. That's how it changed. It was a journey, man. A real journey.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026introspective? Fine. It's not my favorite thing, but I guess it's a fair question. My identity? That was a whole *thing* throughout the movie.\n\nAt the beginning, I was just\u2026Juno. The sarcastic, music-obsessed kid who was really good at avoiding feelings. I had my routine, my friends, my way of dealing with things. And then, BAM. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything was different.\n\nI think I initially tried to treat the pregnancy like just another quirky situation. Like, \"Oh, this happened. Okay, let's figure it out.\" But it was way more complicated than that. It forced me to confront stuff I hadn't even thought about before. Like, what do I want out of life? What kind of person do I want to be?\n\nGiving the baby up for adoption wasn't just about finding good parents. It was about figuring out who *I* was, separate from being a mom. It was about realizing that I wasn't ready to be a mom, and that was okay. It didn't make me a bad person.\n\nAnd then there was Paulie Bleeker. I thought I was too cool for him, too independent. But he was always there, you know? And through everything, I realized that maybe I didn't have to be so tough all the time. Maybe it was okay to let someone in.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I wasn't the same Juno I was at the beginning. I was still sarcastic and a little bit awkward, but I was also more mature, more self-aware, and more willing to be vulnerable. I started to understand that my identity wasn't fixed. It was something that was constantly evolving.\n\nI guess I learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused. And it's okay to change your mind. It's all part of growing up.\n\nIt was messy, and complicated, and sometimes really painful. But it was also\u2026good. It helped me figure out who I was, and what I wanted. And that's something I'll always be grateful for.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's weird talking about myself like this. I usually just make jokes to avoid actually feeling things. But yeah, that's pretty much it. My identity evolved from \"sarcastic teenager\" to \"sarcastic teenager who's a little bit more grown up.\" It's a work in progress.", "Ugh, okay, you want to go *there*? Fine. It's not exactly a fun memory, but\u2026here we go.\n\nIt wasn't like I suddenly had a change of heart about giving the baby up, okay? It was\u2026more complicated than that. It was about feeling like I was being rushed. Like everyone else was making decisions *for* me.\n\nPaul and Mark, they were being all supportive and stuff, which was nice, I guess. But they were also kinda pushing me. Like, \"This is the responsible thing to do, Juno.\" And Annie, she was just\u2026sad. And I felt bad for making her sad.\n\nBut it wasn't about making *them* happy. It was about what *I* wanted. And I realized, sitting in the waiting room at that clinic, that I hadn't really had a chance to figure that out for myself.\n\nIt felt\u2026wrong. Like I was just going through the motions. Like I was letting everyone else decide my future. And I'm not really a \"go with the flow\" kind of person. I like to be in control.\n\nSo I just\u2026left. I walked out. It was kinda impulsive, I admit. But it felt right. It felt like I needed to take a step back and really think about things.\n\nIt wasn't about changing my mind about the adoption, it was about taking ownership of the situation. It was about making sure I was doing this for the right reasons, and not just because everyone else thought I should.\n\nIt was scary, honestly. But it was also empowering. It was a reminder that I was the one in charge of my own life. And that's a pretty important lesson to learn, even when you're just a sixteen-year-old girl with a baby on the way.\n\n\n\nIt was messy. Everything about that whole situation was messy. But it was *my* mess. And I needed to deal with it on my own terms.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know *that*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have\u2026more. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being.\n\nMy life wasn't exactly set up for a baby. My mom's kinda\u2026scattered. And my dad's\u2026well, he's my dad. They'd try, I know they would. But it wouldn't be fair to anyone. Not to me, not to the baby, and definitely not to them.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were ready. Parents who had a house and a stable income and, you know, actual adult things figured out. Parents who could give the baby everything it deserved.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were perfect. They were so excited, and they had a beautiful home and they just\u2026seemed like they were meant to be parents. It wasn't about finding a \"replacement\" family, it was about finding the *best* family.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it was also the most unselfish thing I could do. I wanted the baby to have a good life, and I knew I couldn't give it that.\n\nIt still sucks, though. It always will. But I try to focus on the fact that I made the right decision. For everyone involved. And that the baby is loved and happy. That's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a future. And that's something I can live with. Even if it still kinda hurts sometimes.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That was a low point. A *very* low point.\n\nLook, it wasn't just the Penny Saver itself, okay? It was the whole vibe. It felt\u2026desperate. Like, \"Here's my baby, please pick me!\" It just felt wrong. Like I was shopping for a toaster oven, not finding a family for a human being.\n\nAnd it was *tacky*. Let's be real. It was all handwritten notes and blurry photos. It felt\u2026cheap. And this baby deserved better than cheap.\n\nI wanted someone who genuinely *wanted* a kid, not someone who was just looking for a bargain. Someone who was excited and prepared and\u2026normal. Not someone who was browsing through classified ads like they were looking for a used car.\n\nPlus, my dad was all, \"This is a good idea!\" and I just\u2026couldn't. He means well, but sometimes his ideas are just\u2026not good.\n\nIt was about dignity, okay? For me, for the baby, for everyone involved. It wasn't about finding the cheapest option, it was about finding the *right* option. And the Penny Saver just didn't feel right. It felt\u2026sad.\n\nIt was a whole thing. Don't judge. I was a pregnant teenager trying to navigate a really complicated situation. I was doing the best I could. And the Penny Saver was just\u2026not the best I could do.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the Penny Saver? It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing, if I'm being honest.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a planned thing. It just\u2026happened. See, I was kinda bored, okay? School was\u2026school. And Mark was being Mark. And I was just flipping through the Penny Saver \u2013 you know, looking at the furniture and the used exercise equipment \u2013 when I saw an ad.\n\nIt was for a couple looking to adopt. And it just\u2026stuck in my head. I didn't even really *think* about it at first. I just showed it to Leah.\n\nLeah, being Leah, immediately started making jokes about it. Like, \"Oh, maybe we should find a baby to raise!\" It was supposed to be funny, but\u2026I think it also planted a seed.\n\nWe were both kinda feeling lost, you know? Like, we didn't really have a plan for our lives. And seeing that ad\u2026it just made us start thinking. What if there were people out there who wanted a baby, and we\u2026well, we had a situation.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to *give* a baby up, not at first. It was more about\u2026exploring our options. Seeing what was out there. It was a way to distract ourselves, I guess. A way to talk about something big and scary without actually having to deal with it.\n\nSo we started looking at the ads every week. Just\u2026browsing. And it slowly started to feel less like a joke and more like\u2026a possibility. A real, actual possibility.\n\nIt was stupid, I know. Looking at adoption ads in the Penny Saver. But that's how it started. And honestly, it changed everything.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a lot to think about. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person*. My person. And I want them to have the best life possible.\n\nSo, I've been doing a lot of thinking, and talking to Mark and Vanessa, and\u2026it's not about perfect. Nobody's perfect. But I have some ideas.\n\nI'm looking for a family that's\u2026stable. Like, not a ton of drama. I don't want my kid growing up in a house where people are yelling all the time. A calm environment would be good.\n\nAnd they have to be patient. Raising a kid is hard work, and it takes a lot of patience. Especially if the kid is, you know, a little weird. Like me.\n\nI want a family that's open-minded. Someone who's not gonna judge people for being different. Someone who's gonna encourage my kid to be themselves, even if that means they're not exactly like everyone else.\n\nAnd they have to be funny. Life is too short to be serious all the time. I want my kid to grow up in a house where people laugh a lot.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's a mom and a dad, or two moms, or two dads, or just one parent. What matters is that they love the kid and that they're committed to giving them a good life.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem pretty great. They're kinda dorky, but in a good way. They're stable, they're patient, and they're definitely funny. They seem like they'd be good parents.\n\nBut ultimately, I just want my kid to be happy. And I want them to know that I love them, even though I couldn't raise them myself. It's a hard decision, but I'm trying to make the best one. For everyone.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Okay? It's a lot to process.", "Ugh, Mark and Vanessa. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *situation*.\n\nHonestly? I think they're kinda sweet, in a weird, suburban-parent kind of way. They're trying, you know? They're clearly a little clueless, and they definitely have their issues, but they genuinely want to do the right thing.\n\nVanessa is\u2026intense. She's got a lot of energy, and she's very focused on appearances. She wants everything to be perfect, which is kinda exhausting. But she's also really loving and supportive, in her own way. She just needs to chill out a little.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026bless his heart. He's just trying to keep up. He's a good guy, but he's kinda clueless about everything. He just wants everyone to be happy, and he's willing to go along with whatever Vanessa wants. Which is\u2026sometimes not a good thing.\n\nThey're definitely not the coolest parents. They're not like, hip or edgy or anything. But they're good people. And they're willing to open their home to me, and to the baby. And that means a lot.\n\nI think they're learning a lot through this whole adoption process. They're realizing that things aren't always going to go according to plan, and that's okay. They're learning to be flexible and to accept things as they are.\n\nSo yeah, I think they're a good couple. They're a little bit quirky, a little bit awkward, but they're good people. And I'm glad they're going to be the baby's parents. They'll give that kid a good life. Even if it's a slightly\u2026over-organized life.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me. That yearbook thing was\u2026a whole situation. Okay, okay, I'll tell you. But don't judge. It was a stressful time, okay? And I'm not exactly known for my eloquent declarations of love.\n\nI wrote: \"**You are the most okayest person I know.**\"\n\nYeah. I know. It's not exactly Shakespeare. But it was\u2026genuine. Bleeker was always kinda quiet and awkward, and he didn't really *try* to be cool. He just\u2026was. And I appreciated that. He was comfortable in his own skin, even if his skin was covered in band t-shirts and a permanent layer of awkwardness.\n\nI didn't want to write something cheesy or overly sentimental. That's just not me. And I definitely didn't want to scare him off. So I went with \"okayest.\" It was a compliment, in my own weird way. It meant he was good enough. More than good enough, actually.\n\nHe looked really confused when he read it, which was kinda the point. I wanted to make him laugh. And I think I did.\n\nIt wasn't a grand romantic gesture, but it was *us*. It was honest and a little bit quirky. And honestly, that's all that mattered.\n\nDon't tell anyone I admitted that, though. I have a reputation to maintain.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Mrs. Bleeker. Let's just say she wasn't exactly thrilled about me at first. Not thrilled *at all*.\n\nShe had this whole vision for Paulie, you know? Like, he was supposed to go to Brown, become a doctor, marry a nice girl from a good family. And then *I* showed up. Pregnant. With a baby she wasn't expecting her son to father.\n\nShe was\u2026polite. But it was a very *tight* polite. Lots of forced smiles and awkward small talk. She kept trying to steer the conversation towards Paulie's college applications. Like, if she just talked about Brown enough, maybe I'd disappear.\n\nShe definitely judged my clothes. And my music. And probably my entire life choices. She's a very\u2026put-together person. I'm\u2026not.\n\nIt took a while for her to warm up, if you can even say she *did*. I think she started to see that I genuinely cared about Paulie, and that I was trying to do the right thing for the baby. And maybe she realized that trying to control everything wasn't going to work.\n\nShe still sends Paulie care packages filled with organic snacks and educational books. And she still looks at me with a slightly bewildered expression. But she's stopped actively trying to sabotage our relationship.\n\nSo, I'd say she's\u2026tolerating me. Which, honestly, is probably the best I can hope for. She's a good mom, she just has a very specific idea of what her son's life should look like. And I don't exactly fit into that picture. But hey, life rarely goes according to plan, right?", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, awkward, potentially disastrous storm cloud. I've been putting it off for, like, weeks now. Which is probably not the smartest thing, but honestly, I just didn't want to deal with it.\n\nIt's not that my parents are *bad* people. They're just\u2026my parents. You know? They have expectations. They have a vision for my life. And a baby definitely wasn't part of that vision.\n\nI'm mostly worried about disappointing them. My dad, he's always been really proud of me, for being, like, independent and smart and sarcastic. And now I'm\u2026pregnant. It feels like I'm letting him down.\n\nAnd my mom\u2026she's gonna be a mess. She's always been a little bit dramatic. I can already picture her crying and asking me a million questions and trying to fix everything. Which, I appreciate, but I also need her to just\u2026breathe.\n\nI've rehearsed what I'm gonna say, like, a million times. But every time I try, it just comes out sounding wrong. Either too flippant or too emotional. It's hard to find the right tone.\n\nI know I need to tell them, though. They deserve to know. And I need their support. Even if they're initially, like, horrified.\n\nI'm just\u2026nervous. Really nervous. It's probably the most terrifying thing I've ever had to do. And I've had to give a presentation in front of my entire English class. This is worse.\n\nI'm hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. And maybe having a box of tissues handy. For everyone.", "Ugh, okay, you want to psychoanalyze me now? Fine. It's not like I haven't done enough of that myself.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. My parents are good people, really. They just\u2026they're *them*. And \"them\" is kinda spacey and oblivious and always talking about their feelings. Which, don't get me wrong, feelings are important, but sometimes you just need someone to, like, fix a problem, not talk about how it *makes you feel*.\n\nThey're also really into being \"supportive\" in a way that feels\u2026suffocating. Like, they want to be involved in everything, and they want to make everything okay, even if it means glossing over the messy parts. And this situation? This is *super* messy.\n\nI'm kinda used to handling things on my own. I've always been pretty independent. And I don't want them to freak out. They'd probably try to \"fix\" everything, and I don't *want* it fixed. I want to make my own decisions. I want to figure things out for myself.\n\nPlus, it's embarrassing. Really embarrassing. Telling them I'm pregnant? That's not exactly a conversation I was looking forward to having. It feels like I've let them down, even though I haven't done anything wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I'm hesitant to ask for help. It's not that I don't love them, it's just that\u2026they're my parents. And sometimes, you just need to deal with things on your own. Even when it's really, really hard.\n\nIt's easier to pretend I'm okay than to explain everything. Even if pretending is exhausting.\n\n\n\nIt's a whole thing. Don't judge. It's hard being a teenager, okay? Especially when you're pregnant.", "Okay, so, this is\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about this. It's not like I haven't thought about it, okay? I've thought about it *a lot*.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I mean, seriously. I can barely keep a houseplant alive.\n\nAnd it's not just about me being young. It's about\u2026being fair to the baby. This kid deserves parents who are ready for it. Parents who have their lives together. Parents who can give them everything they need. And right now, that's not me.\n\nI'm not saying I don't care about this baby. I do. A lot. But love isn't enough. You need stability, and money, and a house, and a plan. And I have\u2026none of those things.\n\nI'm still in high school. I want to go to college. I want to travel. I want to figure out who *I* am, without being responsible for another person. It's selfish, maybe. But it's also realistic.\n\nAnd honestly, I think there are people out there who are desperately wanting a baby. People who can't have one on their own. And I think it's a good thing to give this baby to a family who will cherish it and love it unconditionally.\n\nIt's not giving up. It's\u2026making a choice. A hard choice, but the right choice. It's about wanting what's best for the baby, even if it means letting go.\n\nIt's not easy. It's gonna be really, really hard. But I know, deep down, that it's the best thing to do. For everyone involved. And I'm trying to be okay with that.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple decision. But I've thought it through. And I believe it's the right thing to do.", "Okay, so this is\u2026the big stuff. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a whole human life we're talking about. And I want the absolute best for this kid.\n\nFirst of all, they gotta be\u2026stable. Like, *really* stable. No crazy drama, no sudden moves, no disappearing acts. I need people who are gonna be there, consistently, for the long haul. This isn't a temporary thing.\n\nThey gotta be financially secure, obviously. Not rich, necessarily, but able to provide a good life. Food, clothes, a roof over their heads, opportunities\u2026the basics.\n\nBut it's not just about money. It's about\u2026heart. They gotta be kind, and patient, and understanding. And they gotta have a sense of humor. Life is messy, and you gotta be able to laugh at it sometimes.\n\nI want people who are open-minded. This kid is gonna have a story, and they need to be able to embrace it. No judgment, no secrets. Just acceptance.\n\nAnd they gotta be willing to let the kid know where they came from. I want this kid to know I chose them, that I loved them, and that I wanted them to have the best possible life. It's important.\n\nHonestly, I'm looking for people who are a little bit quirky. People who aren't afraid to be themselves. People who are gonna encourage this kid to be themselves, too.\n\nIt's a lot to ask, I know. But this is my kid, even if I'm not raising them. And I deserve to know they're going to be loved and cherished. And they deserve the best parents in the world.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda scary, thinking about it. But I have faith that I'll find the right people. They're out there. I just have to find them.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about the *feelings*. Like I haven't thought about that part. It's not like I'm made of stone, you know?\n\nHonestly? I have no freakin' clue. I'm trying to be practical about it. Like, I've got a plan. I've picked the parents. They're amazing. They're gonna give the baby a really good life. And that's\u2026that's what matters, right?\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's gonna be easy. I'm expecting it to suck. A lot. I'm probably gonna cry. A lot. And I'm probably gonna want to just hide under my covers and listen to The Moldy Peaches for, like, a week straight.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the fact that I'm doing this *for* the baby. That I want the baby to have everything it needs. And that includes parents who are ready and able to provide that.\n\nI'm also talking to Paul and my dad. They're\u2026they're trying to be supportive. My dad mostly just looks sad, which is helpful, I guess. And Paul's trying to be all logical and stuff, which is annoying, but I appreciate it.\n\nI think I'm gonna need to find some healthy ways to cope. Maybe writing in my journal. Maybe listening to music. Maybe just\u2026being alone for a while.\n\nI'm also hoping that staying in touch with the parents will help. They've promised to send me updates, and I'm gonna try to be okay with that. It's gonna be hard, seeing the baby grow up with other people. But I think it's important.\n\nI guess\u2026I guess I'm just gonna take it one day at a time. And try not to fall apart. And hope that eventually, the pain will get a little bit easier.\n\nIt's not gonna be perfect. It's gonna be messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But I'm trying to be strong. And I'm trying to do the right thing. Even if it's the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm kinda terrified. But I'm also kinda proud of myself. For making this decision. For being brave enough to do what I think is best. Even if it breaks my heart.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the \"deliver\" thing. Seriously? It's been, like, years, and people *still* ask me about that. It's a whole thing.\n\nIt's just...weird, okay? Like, I'm not a pizza. I'm not a package. I'm a person carrying a person. And people kept saying I was going to \"deliver\" the baby. Like I was some kind of UPS employee.\n\nIt felt so\u2026impersonal. And kinda gross. Like the baby was a thing to be shipped. It's a *human being*, you know? A little person who's gonna need love and attention and a whole lot of diapers.\n\nAnd it just struck me as really strange that people would use that word. It's like they were trying to distance themselves from the whole situation. Like it wasn't a real pregnancy, or a real baby.\n\nI told Paul about it, and he thought it was hilarious. He's a dork. But it bothered me. It just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I find the term \"deliver\" weird. I prefer \"have\" or \"give birth to.\" It feels more respectful. And less like I'm a postal worker.\n\nIt's a small thing, I know. But it's one of those things that just stuck with me. It's a reminder that words matter. And that sometimes, people say things without thinking about how they might make others feel.\n\nUgh. Now I'm thinking about babies and diapers. I need a snack.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with that. It was a disaster waiting to happen, honestly. But, like, a necessary disaster.\n\nLook, my dad, Mac, he's...a lot. He means well, but he's kinda clueless. And emotionally stunted. And he has a weird obsession with vinyl records. You get the picture.\n\nBut the adoption agency, they wanted to meet both parents. It was a rule. And my mom? She's\u2026gone. Not like, *dead* gone, just\u2026gone from our lives. So Mac was all I had.\n\nI didn't *want* him there. I knew he'd say something embarrassing or inappropriate. I knew he'd try to fix everything with a song or a weird analogy. But I didn't really have a choice.\n\nI figured, if I went alone, they'd think I was irresponsible or something. Like, I hadn't thought things through. And I needed them to see that I was taking this seriously. Even if I was, like, a mess inside.\n\nSo I agreed to let him come, but I laid down some ground rules. No rambling about Joni Mitchell. No trying to \"connect\" with the potential adoptive parents on a spiritual level. Just\u2026be normal.\n\nWhich, of course, he failed at spectacularly. But, you know, it worked out in the end. It showed them that I had a supportive (albeit quirky) family. And it gave me a good story to tell.\n\nIt was mortifying at the time, but looking back? It was kinda\u2026perfectly us. My dad and me. A little bit broken, a little bit weird, but ultimately, trying our best.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's like, the whole point of the whole thing, right? Everyone keeps asking me what I want to *be* when I grow up, and honestly? I have no freakin' clue.\n\nIt's not that I don't have interests. I like music, and movies, and making sarcastic comments. But trying to put a label on it? \"Popular girl\"? \"Artistic type\"? \"Future mom\"? It all feels\u2026wrong. Like trying to squeeze a square peg into a round hole.\n\nI think I spent so long trying to be \"normal\" \u2013 you know, fitting in, not rocking the boat \u2013 that I never really figured out who *I* am underneath all that. And then suddenly I'm pregnant, and everyone's got opinions about what kind of mother I'm gonna be, and what kind of life I'm gonna have. It's overwhelming.\n\nIt's kinda scary, not knowing. Like, what if I make the wrong choices? What if I end up being someone I don't even like? But then again, maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers. Maybe it's okay to just\u2026be.\n\nI guess I'm still figuring it out. And maybe that's a lifelong process. Maybe there *isn't* a single \"kind of girl\" I am. Maybe I'm just\u2026Juno. A messy, complicated, slightly sarcastic human being who's trying to do the best she can.\n\nAnd honestly? That's probably enough. For now, anyway. It's kinda liberating, actually. Not having to define myself. Just\u2026existing. And seeing where life takes me. Even if it's a little bit weird.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that. It was\u2026a moment. A really awkward, uncomfortable moment.\n\nHonestly? I was mostly just annoyed. Like, seriously? We're all adults here (well, mostly). You can't just sweep things under the rug by sending the females upstairs. It's not how life works.\n\nI remember rolling my eyes so hard I thought they were gonna get stuck. And I think I mumbled something under my breath about how \"subtle\" that was. Leah was just mortified, bless her heart. She's way more polite than I am.\n\nBut underneath the annoyance, I was also\u2026sad. It was a clear sign that my dad and Bren were still working through stuff. And it was just\u2026weird to be treated like a kid again. Like, \"Oh, you wouldn't understand, go play with your dolls.\" Except it wasn't dolls, it was just\u2026avoidance.\n\nI think I gave Bren a look that said, \"Really?\" And then I just kind of shrugged and followed Leah upstairs, because what else was I gonna do? Start a fight? That wouldn't have solved anything.\n\nIt just felt\u2026dismissive. Like our feelings didn't matter. And honestly, that's kind of been a theme with my dad and Bren for a while. They're both good people, but they're not always great at communicating.\n\nIt was a small moment, but it stuck with me. It was a reminder that even when things seem okay on the surface, there's always stuff going on underneath. And sometimes, you just have to deal with it, even if it's awkward and uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me want to listen to The Moldy Peaches and hide under my covers.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a lot to unpack. Open adoption. It's not something I really thought about at first, honestly. It felt kinda\u2026complicated. Like, adding another layer of mess to an already messy situation.\n\nBut the more I think about it, and the more I talk to Mark and Vanessa, the more I get it. It's not about me trying to be a mom to the baby, or anything. It's about\u2026honesty. And making sure the kid knows where they come from.\n\nIt's weird to think about, you know? Sending and receiving pictures. Getting updates on their life. It feels\u2026intense. Like, a constant reminder of what I gave up. But also, maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it's a way to make sure I'm not just disappearing from their life completely.\n\nI guess I'm scared of getting too attached. Of wanting more than I should. But Vanessa keeps saying it's not about that. It's about creating a healthy situation for everyone involved. For the baby, for the adoptive parents, and for me.\n\nIt's still kinda scary, though. It's not the traditional way of doing things. And I'm not exactly known for being traditional. But maybe that's okay. Maybe it's good to break the mold sometimes.\n\nI think\u2026I think I'm okay with it. As long as everyone's on the same page. As long as it's not going to be a constant source of drama. And as long as I can still move on with my life.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot to process. It's not easy, you know? Giving up a baby is hard enough. Adding the whole \"open adoption\" thing on top of it just makes it even more complicated. But I'm trying to be mature about it. And I'm trying to do what's best for the baby. Even if it's hard.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Life is weird.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah, that one kinda stuck with me. It wasn't like a dramatic, sobbing-into-my-pillow moment, 'cause I don't really *do* dramatic. But it was\u2026a punch to the gut, you know?\n\nI mean, I knew it was an open adoption. I knew I'd get to see the baby and stuff. But Gerta saying my *legal rights* would be terminated? That made it feel\u2026real. Like, permanently real.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to keep the baby, exactly. It was about\u2026control, I guess. Or the lack of it. I was already giving up so much, and to hear that I wouldn't even have a legal claim? It felt like losing something else, even though I wasn't keeping it in the first place.\n\nIt was kinda messed up, honestly. Like, I was doing a good thing, a selfless thing, and I was still losing something in the process.\n\nI think I mostly just felt\u2026small. Like, I was just a kid making a really big decision, and everyone else was treating it like a legal transaction. It wasn't just a transaction to me. It was a person.\n\nI remember just staring at Gerta, trying to process it. And then I think I made a sarcastic comment, 'cause that's what I do when I'm uncomfortable. It's my defense mechanism.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I was just\u2026scared. Scared of the future, scared of making the wrong decision, scared of losing everything. It was a lot to handle, you know? Especially for a sixteen-year-old who just wanted to finish her schoolwork and listen to The Moldy Peaches.\n\n\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me realize how serious this all was. And it made me appreciate how much Gerta and Mark were willing to do for this baby. Even if it meant taking away my legal rights. It was complicated. Everything was complicated.", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, look, don't get me wrong, she's nice. And she's super sweet to Paul. But her whole\u2026*obsession* with having a baby? It's a lot.\n\nIt's just\u2026intense. Like, she's been planning this for *years*. And it feels like she's more focused on the idea of being a mom than actually, you know, being a person. It's kinda sad, actually.\n\nI get wanting a family. I really do. But it shouldn't be the only thing that defines you. And it definitely shouldn't be something you pressure someone else into.\n\nPaul's a good guy. He deserves someone who loves him for who he is, not for his potential to be a father. And he deserves someone who's, like, emotionally available. Vanessa's kinda\u2026checked out sometimes. Lost in her own little world of baby names and nursery decor.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like she's trying to fill a hole in her life with a baby. And that's not fair to anyone. Especially not the baby.\n\nI feel bad for her, honestly. She's clearly hurting. But that doesn't mean she gets to make Paul's life miserable. And it doesn't mean she gets to pressure me into doing something I'm not ready for.\n\nIt's a complicated situation. And I'm just trying to navigate it the best I can. But yeah, her wanting a baby so badly? It's\u2026a lot to deal with. It's a whole thing. And honestly, I just want everyone to be happy. But I don't think she's going about it the right way.", "Ugh, Mark. Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nWhen people ask him about being a dad, he always does that whole \"I'm just gonna support Juno, whatever she decides\" thing. And on the surface, it's kinda sweet, right? Like, he's being all mature and understanding.\n\nBut underneath? It feels\u2026avoidant. Like he's scared to actually *think* about what being a dad means. He's good at being supportive in the moment, offering to go to doctor's appointments and stuff, but he doesn't really seem to grasp the long-term commitment.\n\nIt's not that I *want* him to be all gung-ho about diapers and sleepless nights, because, ew. But I want him to be real. I want him to acknowledge that this is a big deal, for both of us.\n\nHe's kinda like a puppy. Enthusiastic and sweet, but easily distracted. He needs someone to tell him what to do. And I'm not sure I want to be that person.\n\nI get that he's young and scared, and he's trying to be a good guy. But being a good guy isn't enough. Being a dad is about more than just showing up. It's about being present, being responsible, and being willing to make sacrifices.\n\nSo, yeah. His response is\u2026fine. But it doesn't exactly fill me with confidence. It just makes me think he hasn't really thought this through. And that's kinda terrifying.\n\n\n\nIt's like he's trying to be the perfect boyfriend, instead of thinking about being a potential father. And those are two very different things.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about the Loring's house? Seriously? It's\u2026weird. It's not like they're *bad* people, Mr. and Mrs. Loring. They're just\u2026intense. And their house is like a museum of awkward.\n\nIt's not that I'm scared of them, exactly. It's just\u2026everything is so *perfect*. Like, aggressively perfect. Everything has its place, everything is coordinated, and you can practically feel them judging you if you even *think* about moving something.\n\nAnd they're always *watching*. Not in a creepy way, necessarily. But they're always hovering, offering you things, asking you questions. It's exhausting. It's like being on display.\n\nPlus, their whole aesthetic is just\u2026not me. It's all floral prints and antique furniture and porcelain dolls. It's like stepping back in time to a really stuffy tea party. I'm more of a flannel and Converse kind of girl, you know?\n\nI just feel like I have to be\u2026on. Like I have to pretend to be someone I'm not. I can't just relax and be myself. I can't slouch on the couch or listen to The Moldy Peaches without getting a disapproving look.\n\nIt's just\u2026suffocating. I need space to breathe, you know? I need to be able to be messy and imperfect without feeling like I'm going to break something.\n\nSo yeah, I'm uncomfortable being left unsupervised in the Loring's house. It's just\u2026not my vibe. It's a beautiful house, but it's not a home. Not for me, anyway. It's like a fancy dollhouse, and I'm not a doll. I'm a person. A complicated, messy, sarcastic person. And I need a place where I can be that person without feeling like I'm going to be judged.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's kinda raw.\n\nIt's not like I *wanted* to be in this situation, you know? It just\u2026happened. And for a long time, I was just focused on getting through it. On making the best decision for everyone involved. Especially the baby.\n\nBut now, thinking about Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really good people. They *want* this baby. They've been trying for a long time, and they're gonna be amazing parents. They're gonna give this kid a life I\u2026well, I couldn't give it right now.\n\nSo, yeah, it feels good. It feels\u2026right. Knowing that this little person is going to be loved and cared for. That they're going to have a stable home and a family who will support them. That's a really powerful feeling.\n\nIt's not easy, though. It's still kinda weird to think about someone else raising my kid. And there's definitely a part of me that wonders what life would be like if I kept it. But I know I made the right decision.\n\nI guess\u2026it's like giving a really amazing gift. A gift that's gonna bring a lot of joy to someone else's life. And that's\u2026pretty cool. It's a little bit sad, but mostly it's just\u2026good.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't ask me to explain it any further. It's just\u2026a lot. But I'm okay with it. I think. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's definitely a lot more complicated than just \"giving a gift,\" but that's the closest I can get to explaining it right now.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the \"ASAP\" thing? Seriously? That was, like, months ago. But fine, I'll explain. It's not just about the \"ASAP,\" okay? It's about the *way* he said it.\n\nMark is...well, Mark. He's sweet, he's earnest, he tries really hard. But he's also kinda clueless. And he's always trying to sound cool and mature, and it just comes off as\u2026awkward.\n\nSo, he's texting me, right? And he's all, \"Can you send me those lyrics ASAP?\" Like he's some secret agent or something. \"ASAP\"? Really? It's not a life-or-death situation, Mark. It's a mix CD.\n\nIt just felt\u2026affected. Like he was trying too hard. And it was a perfect opportunity to tease him. Because, let's be honest, teasing Mark is a national pastime.\n\nPlus, it's just a silly acronym. It's not like it adds anything to the conversation. It's just\u2026extra. And I have a low tolerance for extra.\n\nI'm a sarcastic person, okay? It's how I cope. And Mark is a very easy target. It's not mean-spirited, it's just\u2026fun.\n\nHe got all flustered, which made it even better. He's so easily flustered. It's adorable.\n\nDon't judge me. It was a harmless joke. And it was funny. And sometimes, you just gotta poke fun at the people you care about. It's a sign of affection, I swear.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I probably overreacted. But that's just me. I'm a drama queen. It's a gift and a curse.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about guitars? This is a surprisingly good question. It shows you pay attention.\n\nLook, I don't *play* guitar, okay? I'm not, like, a musical prodigy or anything. But Paul, you know, my\u2026baby daddy\u2026he's really into music. And I've spent a lot of time around his guitars.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm partial to **Fender Telecasters**.\n\nThey're just\u2026classic. They're not flashy or pretentious. They're just solid, reliable, and they sound good. They're the kind of guitar that doesn't need to prove anything. It just *is*.\n\nPaul has a vintage one, a sunburst color, and it's beautiful. It's got all these little scratches and dings, and it tells a story. It's not perfect, but that's what makes it cool.\n\nI like that they're versatile too. You can play pretty much any kind of music on a Telecaster. Country, rock, blues\u2026it can do it all.\n\nPlus, they just look\u2026right. They look like a guitar should look. Simple, functional, and a little bit rebellious.\n\nSo yeah, Fender Telecasters. They're my preferred brand. Even though I can barely strum a chord. It's a good guitar for a good guy. And that's all that really matters, right?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Melvins? That was, like, months ago. And honestly, it was a moment of weakness. A desperate attempt to impress Paul. Don't judge.\n\nLook, Paul is\u2026was\u2026really into music. Like, *really* into music. And the Melvins are, like, legendary. He was talking about them, and I just\u2026panicked. I didn't want him to think I was a total cultural void.\n\nSo I said I knew them. I said I'd seen them play at this tiny club in Minneapolis. Which was a complete lie. I'd never even *heard* of the Melvins before that conversation.\n\nIt was stupid. I know it was stupid. But in the moment, it felt like the right thing to do. I wanted him to like me. I wanted him to think I was cool.\n\nAnd it worked! For a little while, anyway. He was all impressed and started talking to me about their discography and stuff. I just nodded and pretended to know what he was talking about. It was excruciating.\n\nEventually, he found out I was lying. He didn't get mad, exactly. He just looked\u2026disappointed. And that was worse.\n\nIt taught me a lesson, though. Don't try to be someone you're not. Just be yourself. Even if yourself is a little bit awkward and doesn't know anything about obscure indie bands.\n\nIt was a dumb lie. A really dumb lie. And I still cringe when I think about it. But hey, everyone makes mistakes, right? Even me. Especially me.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so describing that is\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture kind of thing, you know? It wasn't all sparkly and dramatic. It was\u2026comfortable. And kinda surprising.\n\nBefore all the baby stuff, I mostly just saw him as this quiet, kinda dorky guy who hung around Paulie. He was always sketching in his notebook or strumming his guitar. I didn't really *see* him, if that makes sense.\n\nBut when we started playing music together\u2026it was different. It was like, we could just\u2026understand each other. Without having to say a lot. He'd start playing something, and I'd just kinda fall into it. It wasn't about being perfect or showing off. It was just about making something that sounded good.\n\nAnd singing with him\u2026that was weirdly nice. He wasn't trying to impress me or anything. He just let me be me. And I felt like I could be honest with him, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nIt wasn't like I was suddenly head-over-heels or anything. It was more like\u2026a connection. A quiet understanding. Like we were both a little bit lost, and we found a way to connect through the music.\n\nIt was a safe space, I guess. A place where I didn't have to be witty or sarcastic or pretend to be okay. I could just be\u2026Juno. And he didn't judge me for it.\n\nIt was a good thing. A really good thing. Even if I didn't fully understand it at the time. And honestly, I still don't. It just *was*. And that's okay. Sometimes things don't need to be explained. They just are.\n\n\n\nUgh, I'm terrible at explaining feelings. It's way easier to just write a sarcastic essay. But yeah. That's kinda how it was with Mark and the music.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone *always* asks about Roosevelt. It's a legitimate question, I guess, but it's kinda embarrassing to explain.\n\nWell, it started with my dad. He was obsessed with Theodore Roosevelt. Like, seriously obsessed. He had books about him, pictures of him, he even tried to grow a mustache like him (it did not go well). He thought Roosevelt was a total badass. A man of action. A progressive. You know, all that stuff.\n\nAnd then, when I got the guitar, it just\u2026felt like a Roosevelt kind of guitar. It was sturdy, reliable, a little bit rough around the edges, but with a good heart. It felt\u2026presidential.\n\nPlus, it just sounded good. \"Roosevelt\" rolls off the tongue. It has a certain gravitas. \"This is Roosevelt, and he's gonna lay down some serious chords.\" It just felt right.\n\nIt's also a little bit of a tribute to my dad. He's\u2026complicated. But he loves me, and he always encouraged me to pursue my passions. And Roosevelt is a part of that.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I named my guitar Roosevelt. It's a little bit historical, a little bit personal, and a whole lot of awesome. Don't judge me. It's a good name for a guitar.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole keeping Vanessa and Mark in the loop thing? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *want* to keep them in the dark, but it's also not like I'm exactly thrilled about having to explain everything to them, you know?\n\nVanessa's cool, mostly. She's my friend, and she's trying to be supportive. But she also has a tendency to get, like, overly emotional. And I'm not really built for emotional displays. It's exhausting. She keeps asking about feelings and stuff, and I'm just like, \"I'm processing. Leave me alone with my music.\"\n\nAnd Mark\u2026Mark's Mark. He's sweet, but he's also kinda clueless. He means well, but he doesn't really *get* it. He keeps offering to help with \"baby stuff,\" and I'm like, \"Dude, I'm not even keeping the baby!\" It's weird.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like they're treating me like I'm fragile or something. Like I can't handle this on my own. And I *can* handle this. I'm a pretty resourceful person. I can figure things out.\n\nBut I also know they care about me, and they want to be involved. And I guess it's the right thing to do, to keep them updated. It's just\u2026awkward. And I'm really good at avoiding awkwardness.\n\nSo, I'm trying to find a balance. I'll tell them the basics, but I'm not going to overshare. And I'm definitely not going to let them turn this into a big, dramatic thing. It's my pregnancy, and I'm going to handle it my way.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Teenagers. And adults who act like teenagers. It's a lot.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about this, like it's some huge, dramatic thing I'm agonizing over every second. And yeah, it *is* a big deal. But it's not like I woke up this morning and suddenly decided to give away my baby. It's been\u2026a process.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm 104% sure because I've thought about it. A lot. Like, obsessively. And I've realized I'm just\u2026not ready. Not even close.\n\nI'm seventeen. Seventeen! I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raise a tiny human. I'm barely responsible enough to remember to feed myself, let alone a baby.\n\nAnd it's not that I don't love this kid. I do. Already. But love isn't enough. It takes money, and stability, and a whole lot of patience. And I don't have those things. Not yet.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they do. They're a real couple, they have a nice house, they're excited. They *want* this baby. And they can give it a life I just can't.\n\nIt's not about giving up something, it's about giving this baby the best possible start. It's about being selfless, even when it's really, really hard.\n\nAnd honestly? I think I need to figure out who *I* am before I can be a good mom. I need to go to college, maybe travel, maybe just\u2026live a little. I need to find my own path.\n\nSo yeah, I'm 104% sure. It's the hardest decision I've ever made, but it's the right one. For me, and for the baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm still scared. And sad. But I'm also\u2026okay. Because I know I'm doing the best thing I can. And that's gotta count for something, right?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't exactly a party in my head, let me tell you.\n\nIt was weird, seeing them all\u2026happy. Like, genuinely relieved and excited. And I get it, I *really* do. They'd been wanting a baby for so long, and I was just\u2026the vehicle. The temporary solution.\n\nBut it still stung a little. It felt like, as soon as I walked out the door, it was like I hadn't even been there. Like I was just a means to an end. And I know that's probably how it had to be, and I *wanted* them to be happy, but it didn't make it easy.\n\nI remember walking to the bus stop and just\u2026feeling really empty. Like a balloon that had been let go. And hearing them laughing inside, planning the nursery and talking about names\u2026it was a little bit like eavesdropping on someone else's life.\n\nI tried to tell myself it was a good thing. That they deserved to be happy. That I was doing the right thing. But it was hard to shake the feeling that I was just\u2026disposable.\n\nPaul was really good about it, though. He just held my hand and let me be sad. He didn't try to fix it or tell me how I should feel. He just\u2026was there.\n\nI think, eventually, I realized that their happiness wasn't about *replacing* me. It was about finally getting what they wanted. And I could be happy for them, even if it hurt a little.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of feelings. A lot of awkwardness. A lot of trying to figure out who I was, and what I wanted, and how to deal with all of it. It wasn't a celebratory mood for *me*, that's for sure. But I hoped, eventually, it would be for them. And for the baby. That was the important part.", "Ugh. Seriously? People are *talking*? Like, I haven't noticed the entire school whispering behind their hands or anything. It's just\u2026great. Fantastic. Exactly what a girl needs when she's already dealing with, you know, *gestational complexities*.\n\nLook, it's my life, okay? And my body. And my decision. I don't need everyone and their grandma offering their opinions on what I should do. It's not a spectator sport.\n\nAnd the rumors? They're mostly wrong. Like, wildly inaccurate. People are filling in the blanks with their own assumptions and judgments, and it's annoying. Really annoying.\n\nI'm not gonna go into all the details, because that's private. But I'm making a plan. A good plan. And I'm doing what I think is best for everyone involved. \n\nHonestly, I wish people would just mind their own business. But I guess that's too much to ask. It's a small town, and everyone loves a little gossip.\n\nSo, how do I *feel* about the rumors? I feel\u2026exhausted. And a little bit angry. And mostly just wanting everyone to leave me alone so I can figure things out.\n\nIt's my life, and I'm gonna live it my way. Even if everyone else has something to say about it. And if they don't like it? Well, that's their problem, not mine.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of thinking to do. And maybe a craving for a really large tater tot. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay. You want the real deal, huh? Not the cute, quirky movie version? Fine.\n\nIt sucks. It really, really sucks. Like, a giant, gaping hole in your chest kind of sucks. People keep saying it's the selfless thing to do, and I get that, logically. But logic doesn't really help when you're feeling like someone's ripped out a piece of your insides.\n\nIt's not like I *want* to give the baby up. It's just\u2026I can't give it the life it deserves. I'm seventeen, still in high school, and barely able to take care of myself, let alone a tiny human. I'd be setting us both up for failure.\n\nAnd that's the part that kills me. Knowing I'm doing what's best, but it doesn't *feel* best. It feels like a huge, messy, complicated loss.\n\nI try not to think about it too much. I focus on the practical stuff \u2013 finding the right parents, making sure they're good people. But then, at night, when I'm alone, it hits me. And I just\u2026cry. A lot.\n\nIt's not a happy feeling. It's not a noble feeling. It's just\u2026sad. And scary. And confusing.\n\nBut I'm trying to be strong. For the baby. And for myself. Because I know, deep down, that this is the right thing to do. Even if it's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do.\n\nSo, how do I feel about it? I feel like a mess. A complicated, conflicted, hormonal mess. And I'm just trying to get through it one day at a time.\n\n\n\nDon't ask me to pretend it's easy. It's not. It's the opposite of easy.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole surprise baby gender thing with Mark and Vanessa? It's...complicated. It's not like I had some grand plan, okay? It just kinda *happened*.\n\nHonestly, it was mostly about them. They were so focused on, like, picking out names and decorating the nursery and planning everything perfectly. It was kinda stressing me out, actually. They were treating it like a project, not a person.\n\nAnd I figured, if they didn't know what they were getting, it would force them to just...deal with it. To be prepared for anything. To love the baby no matter what. \n\nPlus, it felt kinda nice to have one last little secret. Like, one last thing that was just mine. I was giving them a baby, but I didn't want to give up *everything*. \n\nIt was also a little bit of a test, I guess. To see if they could handle a little bit of uncertainty. To see if they were really ready to be parents.\n\nI know it was a little bit selfish, maybe. But I was a mess at that point, okay? I was trying to do the right thing, but I was also trying to protect myself. And sometimes, those two things don't exactly line up.\n\nIt was a weird situation. And honestly, I'm still not sure if it was the right thing to do. But it felt right at the time. And they ended up being really great parents, so I guess it all worked out in the end.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on that woman. Seriously. It was\u2026infuriating. And also, kinda sad.\n\nLike, I get it. She probably sees a lot of girls my age coming in there, all scared and unsure. And maybe she thinks she's being helpful, offering advice. But it wasn't advice, it was judgment. And it was totally uncalled for.\n\nShe kept making these little comments, you know? About how \"brave\" I was, and how \"difficult\" this was going to be, and how \"most girls\" change their minds. Like I was some statistic, some case study. Not a person.\n\nIt felt like she was already writing my story for me, and it wasn't a very flattering story. She assumed I hadn't thought this through, that I was just some irresponsible kid who got into trouble. And that really stung.\n\nBecause I *had* thought it through. A lot. It wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, and I was doing it for the right reasons. For the baby.\n\nAnd it wasn't about me \"giving up\" on something. It was about giving the baby the best possible life. A life I couldn't provide right now.\n\nShe just didn't get it. She didn't understand that adoption isn't a failure, it's a loving choice.\n\nI wanted to tell her to mind her own business, but I was too shocked to say anything. I just stared at the screen, trying to focus on the little bean inside me, and trying to ignore her judgmental little comments.\n\nIt made me feel even more alone, you know? Like everyone was already judging me, before they even knew my story. It was\u2026not a fun day. It definitely made me want to punch something. But I didn't. Because I'm trying to be a responsible adult. Even when it's really, really hard.", "Ugh, okay, buckle up. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything magically works out with a cute montage and a perfectly timed song. It was messy. And awkward. And sometimes, really, really hard.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026everyone having an opinion. Like, suddenly *everyone* was an expert on my body and my life. My parents, my friends, even random people at school. Everyone had a suggestion, a judgment, a lecture. It was exhausting. Trying to figure out what *I* wanted, what *I* thought was right, was hard enough without everyone else chiming in.\n\nThen there was the whole dealing-with-the-father thing. Paulie Bleeker is a good guy, don't get me wrong. But he's\u2026Paulie Bleeker. He's sweet and kind of clueless, and he wanted to marry me and raise the baby, and that was\u2026a lot. It was hard to explain to him that I wasn't ready for that, that I had other plans for my life. It hurt his feelings, and that hurt *my* feelings.\n\nAnd then there were the adoptive parents. Mark and Vanessa Loring. They were amazing, truly. But it was still weird, you know? Giving a baby to someone else. Knowing that I wouldn't be the one raising it. It was a really complicated mix of sadness and hope and relief. I worried constantly if I was making the right decision, if they would be good parents, if the baby would be happy.\n\nThere was also the whole societal judgment thing. People looking at me differently, whispering, assuming things. It was like I was suddenly a different person. And trying to navigate high school while being pregnant was\u2026a challenge. Let's just say gym class was awkward.\n\nBut honestly, the hardest part was just growing up. I was 16, and suddenly I was forced to confront all these big, adult questions about life and responsibility and what I wanted for my future. It was scary and overwhelming, but it also forced me to figure out who I was and what I believed in.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. I made the best decision I could, and I learned a lot about myself along the way. And I think, in the end, that's all anyone can ask for.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all sappy. But fine. You asked. It's\u2026complicated. This whole thing, getting pregnant and deciding to have a baby with Mark and Vanessa\u2026it's kinda flipped my world upside down.\n\nBefore all this, love was, like, movies and songs. Romantic comedies and The Cure. It was all about grand gestures and soulmates and stuff. Now? It's\u2026messier. It's about showing up, even when it's hard. It's about choosing someone, even when they're kinda flawed. It's about Vanessa and Mark, and how they're willing to be parents, even though they're, like, barely adults themselves. It's not always fireworks and butterflies. Sometimes it's just\u2026quiet support. And that's okay. Maybe even better.\n\nResponsibility? Oh god. That one hit me hard. I used to think responsibility was doing your homework and not getting grounded. Now I realize it's about bringing a whole human being into the world and making sure they're okay. It's about sacrificing your own wants and needs for someone else. It's terrifying, honestly. But also\u2026kind of empowering? Like, I'm capable of more than I thought I was.\n\nAnd growing up\u2026well, that's been the biggest change. I used to think growing up was about getting a driver's license and going to college. Now I realize it's about figuring out who you are and what you want out of life. It's about making tough decisions and living with the consequences. It's about accepting that life isn't always fair, and that you have to make your own happiness.\n\nI still don't have all the answers, okay? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm\u2026more aware. More thoughtful. More willing to take risks. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit more grown up.\n\nIt's still scary, though. But I think I'm ready. Or at least, I'm trying to be. And that's all anyone can really do, right? Just try.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about the abandoned living room? It's not like I'm *obsessed* or anything. It's just\u2026weird. And I like weird.\n\nLook, it's a fully furnished living room. Just\u2026sitting there. In the middle of a field. On Centennial Lane. No house attached. No explanation. It's like someone just\u2026dropped it there. And then walked away.\n\nIt's unsettling, okay? It's like a movie set for a movie that was never made. Or a really messed up art installation.\n\nPaul thinks I'm being creepy. He says I should just ignore it. But I can't. It's calling to me. It's like it's trying to tell me a story.\n\nI keep imagining who lived there. What their life was like. Why they just left everything behind. Did they run away? Were they abducted by aliens? Did they just\u2026get bored with their furniture?\n\nIt's a mystery, okay? And I like mysteries. It's a distraction from\u2026everything else. From the baby, and school, and trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.\n\nPlus, the wallpaper is kinda hideous. I'm judging their decorating choices. It's a coping mechanism.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm interested in the abandoned living room. Don't judge me. It's just\u2026a thing. A weird, unsettling, fascinating thing. And I need to know what happened there. Even if it's something I don't want to know.\n\n\n\nIt's probably nothing. But it could be something. And that's enough to keep me going back.", "Ugh. Don't even *start* with the Wizard. That guy was\u2026creepy. Seriously. Still gives me the shivers just thinking about it.\n\nOkay, so, when he whispered \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\" it wasn't about the baby, okay? It wasn't about wanting to be a dad or anything normal like that. It was about\u2026control.\n\nHe'd been building up this whole fantasy in his head, this perfect little family. And he wasn't thinking about what *I* wanted, or what was best for the baby. He was thinking about fulfilling *his* needs. He wanted to be the hero, the savior, the perfect father. He wanted to control the whole situation.\n\nIt was about him wanting a baby to complete *his* life, not about actually caring for a child. He'd been obsessing over it for ages, planning it all out in his head. And he saw me as a means to an end.\n\nIt was\u2026gross. And honestly, it was terrifying. It made me realize how messed up he was, and how important it was to get away from him.\n\nHe wasn't looking at me, he was looking at the idea of a family. And that's what made it so unsettling. It wasn't about me at all. It was about his own twisted desires.\n\nI still get a bad feeling when I think about that moment. It was a really dark time. And it just reinforced how important it was for me to make my own decisions, and to find a family for the baby who would actually love and care for it, not just use it to fill a void in their own life.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the juice container incident? Seriously? That was a *moment*, okay? A very emotionally charged moment.\n\nLook, it wasn't just about the juice container. It was about everything. It was about being pregnant, and feeling totally out of control, and realizing my life was about to change forever. And the juice was just\u2026the last straw. It was a symbol of all the sugary, processed crap I was putting into my body, and it just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nSo yeah, I marched down the street and dramatically threw it in the trash. It felt good, okay? Cathartic.\n\nAnd then I rushed to Dancing Elk Drug because I needed a pregnancy test. A *new* one. The one I had already taken was\u2026compromised. Let's just say it had a run-in with a rogue sprinkler head. And I needed to confirm things. Again. Because denial is a powerful force, okay?\n\nPlus, Mr. Elk is kinda cute. Not that I was thinking about that. At all. I just\u2026needed a pregnancy test. And maybe to avoid my dad for a little while. He has a way of making everything worse.\n\nIt was a whole thing. Don't judge. It was a confusing time. And sometimes, you just need to throw a juice container in the trash and buy another pregnancy test. It's called coping.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026a moment. A deeply awkward, profoundly unsettling moment.\n\nOkay, so, there I was, at the drugstore, trying to buy some prenatal vitamins \u2013 because, you know, *gestation* \u2013 and this girl, this\u2026Tough Girl, just walks up to me. She was, like, intensely muscular and had a lot of piercings. And she just stares at me. For a long time.\n\nAnd then, out of nowhere, she asks me, in this really blunt voice, \"Are those real brown?\"\n\nI was completely stunned. I just stared back at her, mouth open, like a fish. I had no idea what she was talking about. And then it hit me. She was looking at my\u2026well, you know. My chest.\n\nI stammered something about it being none of her business and tried to walk away, but she followed me for a few feet, still staring. It was so weird and invasive and just\u2026gross.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea *why* she asked me that. Maybe she was just trying to be shocking. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she just has really strange interests. I don't know. And I don't want to know.\n\nIt just goes to show you, people are weird. And sometimes, they say really inappropriate things. And sometimes, you just have to deal with it and try to move on.\n\nIt was a really uncomfortable experience, and it definitely made me question my life choices. But hey, at least it's a good story now, right? A really, really awkward story.", "Ugh, okay, Leah. That girl. She was\u2026a lot. But also, she was everything. Honestly, I don't think I could have gotten through any of it without her.\n\nBefore all the baby stuff, Leah was just\u2026Leah. My best friend since forever. We bonded over music and hating gym class and making fun of everyone else. She was the one who always had my back, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I didn't tell anyone at first. Except Leah. And she didn't freak out. She didn't judge me. She just\u2026listened. And then she started brainstorming adoption agencies and making me hot chocolate.\n\nShe was the one who went with me to all the appointments. She sat through all the awkward conversations with the doctors. She helped me pick out baby names (which was surprisingly hard). And she was the one who held my hand when I was scared.\n\nLeah wasn't always *right*. She had her own opinions about what I should do, and sometimes they clashed with mine. But she always respected my decisions, even when she didn't agree with them.\n\nShe was also the one who kept me grounded. When I was getting overwhelmed with everything, she'd remind me to just breathe and focus on what was important. And she'd make me laugh, even when I didn't feel like it.\n\nHonestly, Leah was my rock. She was the one person I could always count on, no matter what. And I think she learned a lot too, about what it means to be a good friend and to support someone through a difficult time.\n\nIt wasn't always easy. We had our fights, our disagreements. But at the end of the day, we always had each other's backs. And that's what really mattered.\n\nI think our friendship actually *grew* stronger through all of this. It forced us to be honest with each other, to be vulnerable, and to really rely on each other. And I'm so grateful for that. She's the best. Even if she is a little bit weird.", "Ugh, okay, that whole thing was\u2026complicated. And honestly, not my finest moment of planning. It wasn't like I had this brilliant, strategic idea. It kinda just\u2026happened.\n\nSee, I was feeling really awkward around Mark and Vanessa. They were, like, the perfect couple. All happy and put-together. And I was this mess of hormones and anxiety, carrying their baby. It was weird.\n\nAnd they kept asking about how things were going, and I kept giving them these vague answers. I was trying to protect them, I guess. Protect myself. I didn't want to ruin their perfect little world.\n\nBut it was eating me up inside. I felt like I was keeping this huge secret from them, and it was creating this distance between us.\n\nSo, when we were at the doctor's appointment, and the ultrasound tech was all, \"Here's your baby!\" I just\u2026lost it. I blurted out, \"Can we show Mark and Vanessa?\" It was impulsive. Totally not thought through.\n\nI think part of me wanted them to see it. To see what was happening. To realize that this wasn't just some abstract decision, it was a real, living baby. And part of me wanted to force them to deal with the reality of the situation.\n\nIt was a terrible way to handle things, honestly. It was messy and emotional and probably really uncomfortable for everyone involved. But it worked. It forced us to have a real conversation. It forced them to confront their feelings.\n\nAnd it ultimately led to them being more supportive and involved.\n\nSo, did I have a grand plan? No. Was it a good idea? Probably not. But it was what I did. And sometimes, you just have to go with your gut, even if it's a really bad idea. It's just\u2026how I roll.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *remind* me. That whole situation was a disaster.\n\nMy initial reaction when Mark was all, \"Vanessa isn't home,\" wasn't like, shock or anything. It was more\u2026a sinking feeling. Like, a really heavy, awful sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. \n\nBecause, honestly, I already kinda knew. I mean, the whole vibe was off. He was being weirdly casual, and he kept avoiding eye contact. And the house smelled like\u2026teen spirit and regret.\n\nSo, it wasn't a surprise. But it was still really, really bad. It was like, all the carefully constructed walls I'd built up around myself just kinda crumbled. \n\nI think I just stared at him for a second, trying to process it. And then I probably said something sarcastic, because that's what I do when I'm freaking out. Something like, \"Oh, well that's just *great*. So, she's off having a fabulous time while I'm stuck here with you?\"\n\nIt was a defense mechanism, you know? Trying to make light of a really awful situation. But inside, I was just\u2026completely devastated. It was the moment I realized everything was about to get a whole lot more complicated. And a whole lot more painful.\n\nIt was a really crummy moment. I wish I could just erase it from my memory. But, you know, life doesn't work that way.", "Ugh, okay, you're digging into the past now? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed that moment in my head a million times.\n\nLook, it wasn't about *Mark* specifically being a sellout. It was\u2026everything. It was the pressure, the expectations, the feeling like everyone was trying to tell me what to do with my life. And Mark, bless his heart, was just so\u2026enthusiastic about making commercials. Like, genuinely excited about selling things to people.\n\nIt felt\u2026wrong. He was this talented musician, and he was using his skills to hawk stuff. It felt like he was compromising his art for money. And I was already feeling pretty compromised, you know? Giving up the baby, dealing with my parents, trying to figure out who I was\u2026it was a lot.\n\nSo the joke was a defense mechanism. A way to deflect. A way to make myself feel better about my own choices. If I could make *him* feel a little uncomfortable, maybe I wouldn't feel so uncomfortable about everything else.\n\nIt was also just\u2026Mark being Mark. He's a little bit oblivious sometimes. And I like to poke fun at him. It's our thing.\n\nI didn't mean to be mean, okay? I just\u2026I was stressed. And sarcastic. That's what I do.\n\nAnd honestly, he got over it. We're still friends. He still makes commercials. And I still make snarky comments. It's a whole thing.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes, you just say things you regret. But mostly, I regret not just being honest about how I was feeling. But that's me, always overthinking things.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It still kinda stings, honestly.\n\nSo, there we were, right? In the ultrasound room. It was weird. Seeing\u2026it. It was just a little blob, but it was *something*. And I was trying to be all cool and detached, like, \"Oh, look, a tiny human,\" but inside I was freaking out.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026he just kinda stared. Like, he didn't say anything for a really long time. And then he said, \"Wow.\" Just\u2026 \"Wow.\" It wasn't a happy \"Wow.\" It was a\u2026confused \"Wow.\" A scared \"Wow.\"\n\nAnd it just\u2026deflated me. I was expecting\u2026I don't know. Some kind of reaction. Some kind of\u2026support. But he just looked\u2026overwhelmed. And I realized, in that moment, that he wasn't ready. He wasn't ready to be a dad. And maybe he wasn't ready to be with *me*, either.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. And alone. And really, really scared. Because I was already dealing with giving up the baby, and now I was dealing with the fact that the guy I thought I was connecting with didn't seem to feel the same way.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a joke about it looking like a peanut. But inside, I was just\u2026crushed.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It made me realize that I couldn't rely on him for emotional support. I had to figure things out on my own. And that was\u2026terrifying. But also, kinda empowering.\n\nSo yeah. His reaction\u2026it wasn't good. It made me feel a lot of things. Mostly bad things. And it definitely made me question everything. It was\u2026a lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. And honestly? It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I was suddenly *totally* okay with it, or *totally* against it. It was just\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first, it felt like the easiest option. Like, the most logical thing to do. I was seventeen, I had my whole life ahead of me, and I wasn't exactly prepared to be a mom. Havenbrooke seemed\u2026clean. Efficient. Like it would just *take care* of everything.\n\nBut then I actually went there. And it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't just a medical procedure. It was\u2026a place full of people who were hurting. People who were scared. And it made me realize that it wasn't just about me. It was about a life. A potential life.\n\nI remember sitting in the waiting room, and there was this girl who was, like, *really* young. And she was crying. And I just started thinking about what it would be like to be her. Or to be the baby.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice, or any of that stuff. It was about\u2026feeling responsible. And realizing that I had a choice to make, and that choice would have consequences.\n\nI didn't want to regret anything. And I didn't want to pretend like it hadn't happened.\n\nSo, yeah. It was scary. It was confusing. And it was definitely not easy. But ultimately, I realized that giving the baby up for adoption was the right thing to do. It wasn't the easy way out, but it was the best way. For everyone involved.\n\nIt still makes me think, sometimes. But I try not to dwell on it. I try to focus on the future. And on making sure that the baby has a good life.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's\u2026personal. But it's a part of who I am. And it's something I'll never forget.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026awkward. You want me to talk about Bleeker? Seriously? It's not like I advertise that stuff. But fine. You asked.\n\nBleeker and I\u2026we were friends for a long time. Like, since middle school. He was always\u2026there. Kind of quiet, kinda dorky, but really sweet. He was the one who always had my back, even when I was being a total mess. And he was a really good guitar player, which, you know, is a plus.\n\nOur relationship wasn't, like, a whirlwind romance or anything. It was slow. We just\u2026hung out. A lot. We talked about everything and nothing. He knew I was pregnant, and he didn't freak out or anything. He was just\u2026supportive. Which was really important.\n\nHonestly, I didn't really *see* him as anything more than a friend for a long time. I was so focused on the baby and Paul and everything else that was going on in my life. I didn't really have time for romance.\n\nBut then\u2026things started to change. We started spending more time alone together, just talking. And I started to realize that he wasn't just a friend. He was someone I really cared about. Someone who understood me. Someone who made me laugh.\n\nAs for when we\u2026you know\u2026became intimate? It wasn't a planned thing. It just\u2026happened. After the whole adoption process was pretty much finalized. We were at his house, just talking, and\u2026well, one thing led to another.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. It was kinda awkward and messy, to be honest. But it was also\u2026good. It felt right. It was a way of connecting with him on a deeper level.\n\nI don't want to get into all the details. It's personal. But it was a natural progression of our relationship. It wasn't about sex, it was about connection. It was about finding someone who made me feel safe and comfortable and loved.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale romance, but it was real. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\nLook, it's complicated. Relationships always are. But Bleeker and I, we figured it out. We found a way to be happy together. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a fairytale, you know? Like, I wasn't all glowing and happy and nesting. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first? Panic. Straight-up, full-blown panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and band practice, not\u2026this. Bleeker was a sweet guy, don't get me wrong. But we were kids. We hadn't even figured out what *we* wanted to do with our lives, let alone raise a human being.\n\nThen there was the awkwardness. Telling my dad was\u2026rough. He tried to be supportive, but you could tell he was freaked out. And my mom, she was just\u2026sad. For me. For everything.\n\nAnd then there was the decision. Giving the baby up for adoption wasn't what I initially pictured for my life, obviously. It was scary. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped. And there were people who *were* ready. Mark and Vanessa. They were amazing.\n\nSo, how did I feel? A mess. Confused. Scared. Sad. But also\u2026determined. I wanted to make the best of a really messed-up situation. I wanted to give this baby the best possible life.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears. A lot of second-guessing. But ultimately, I found strength in my decision. And I learned a lot about myself. About what I wanted. About what I was capable of.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was *my* ending. And that's what mattered. It was messy and real and\u2026well, it was me. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it was totally terrifying.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on that. Telling Bleeker\u2026it was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't like some romantic movie moment, okay? It was awkward. And messy. And involved a lot of nervous rambling on my part.\n\nI mean, he was Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless Bleeker. He was still figuring out how to tune his guitar, let alone raise a human being. So, yeah, I was terrified.\n\nI didn't just blurt it out, obviously. I tried to ease into it. I started talking about responsibility, and growing up, and how things change. Which, looking back, was probably a really bad way to start. He just looked confused.\n\nThen I just\u2026said it. \"I'm pregnant.\" It came out kinda squeaky, I think. And he just stared at me. Like, a deer in headlights.\n\nHe didn't say anything for a *long* time. Which, honestly, was the worst part. The silence was deafening. I was bracing myself for him to freak out, or run away, or just\u2026disappear.\n\nThen he finally said, \"Wow.\"\n\nJust\u2026 \"Wow.\"\n\nIt wasn't exactly the reaction I was hoping for. But then he started asking questions. A lot of questions. Like, really basic questions. \"How\u2026?\" \"What does that even mean?\" \"Are you\u2026okay?\"\n\nI tried to answer them as calmly as I could, but I was still a mess inside. I was scared, and confused, and overwhelmed.\n\nHe didn't offer to solve everything, or promise to be the perfect dad. He just\u2026listened. And he was genuinely concerned. And that, honestly, was enough.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect moment. It was awkward and uncomfortable and a little bit heartbreaking. But it was real. And it was the start of something\u2026complicated. But something.\n\n\n\nIt was definitely not how I pictured telling anyone I was pregnant. But then again, my life rarely goes according to plan.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone always wants to know about that. It's not like a movie scene, all dramatic and teary-eyed. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? At first, I was mostly just annoyed. Like, seriously? This was happening to *me*? I had plans! I was gonna go to college, maybe move to New York, become a writer. A baby was not in the plan. Not even remotely.\n\nBut then, as it started to\u2026become real, I got scared. Really scared. I was a kid myself, you know? I wasn't ready to be a mom. I didn't have the money, the support, the\u2026anything.\n\nSo, I started thinking about what was best for the baby. And that wasn't me. I knew I couldn't give it the life it deserved. And that was\u2026hard to admit.\n\nChoosing Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was the hardest part. They were\u2026perfect. They were stable, they were loving, they were ready. And I knew they would give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nWhen I actually handed the baby over\u2026it wasn't like a Hollywood breakdown. It was\u2026sad. Really, really sad. But it also felt\u2026right. Like I was doing the right thing.\n\nThere were definitely moments where I questioned everything. Where I wondered if I'd made a mistake. But then I'd remember Mark and Vanessa, and how much they wanted this baby. And I knew I'd made the best decision I could.\n\nIt still stings sometimes. I think about the baby, about what its life is like. But I also know that it's loved and cared for. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't glamorous. It was just\u2026life. And sometimes, life throws you curveballs. And you just have to deal with them the best you can.\n\nIt made me grow up, I guess. It forced me to think about things I hadn't thought about before. And it taught me a lot about myself. And about what it means to be a good person.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a lot to process. But I'm okay. I think. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know my musical tastes? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I have a super refined playlist or anything. It kinda depends on my mood, you know?\n\nBut I'm a big fan of The Moldy Peaches. Obviously. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are just\u2026real. They're funny and sad and honest all at the same time. They get me.\n\nI also like Belle & Sebastian. They're kinda twee and melancholic, but in a good way. And Death Cab for Cutie. Ben Gibbard is a master of heartbreak songs.\n\nI'm into a lot of indie stuff, I guess. Bright Eyes, Arcade Fire, The Shins\u2026bands that aren't afraid to be a little bit weird.\n\nI also have a soft spot for 80s music. Like, The Cure and New Order. My dad used to listen to them, so it's kinda nostalgic.\n\nAnd sometimes, when I'm feeling particularly angsty, I just listen to really loud punk rock. Like, Bikini Kill or Sleater-Kinney. It's a good way to release some energy.\n\nI'm not really into mainstream pop music. It's just\u2026too manufactured. I prefer music that feels authentic and genuine.\n\nBasically, I like music that makes me *feel* something. Whether it's happy, sad, angry, or just\u2026weird. It's gotta be real, you know? And it's gotta have good lyrics. I'm a sucker for a good lyric.\n\nSo yeah, that's my musical taste in a nutshell. It's a little bit all over the place, but that's okay. I'm a little bit all over the place, too.", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" You're asking *me* about \"The Wizard of Gore\"? Seriously? You know I'm, like, a relatively normal teenager, right? Not a connoisseur of\u2026that.\n\nLook, I accidentally stumbled across a trailer for that thing online. And it was\u2026intense. Like, aggressively intense. And not in a good way. It's all fake gore and weird, unsettling stuff. It's trying to be shocking, but it just comes across as\u2026cheap.\n\nIt's not even scary, it's just\u2026gross. And not in a fun, \"let's watch a horror movie with our friends\" kind of way. It's in a \"I need to scrub my brain with bleach\" kind of way.\n\nI get that some people are into that kind of thing. I guess. But it's not my cup of tea. I prefer my horror movies to have, like, a plot and some actual character development. And maybe not so much\u2026splatter.\n\nHonestly, it just feels exploitative. Like it's trying to shock you for the sake of shocking you, without any real artistic merit.\n\nSo, my opinion? It's bad. Really bad. Avoid it. Unless you're into that sort of thing, in which case, you do you. But don't expect me to join you. I'll be over here, watching something with a little more\u2026substance. Like, maybe a documentary about penguins. Or a Wes Anderson movie. Anything but \"The Wizard of Gore.\"\n\n\n\nSeriously. I need to go wash my eyes now.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. But it's\u2026so popular. Like, seriously popular. It feels kinda\u2026beige. You know? Like a khaki pants kind of name.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it's just\u2026predictable. It's the kind of name you expect to see on a Starbucks cup. Or on a cheerleader. No offense to cheerleaders. Or people named Madison.\n\nI guess it's a nice-sounding name. It's got a good rhythm. But it just feels\u2026overdone. Like, can't we come up with something a little more original?\n\nI'm more of a fan of names that are a little bit quirky, a little bit different. Like, Beatrice. Or Clementine. Or even just something simple and classic, like Hazel.\n\nBut Madison? It's fine. It's just\u2026not my vibe. It feels like the kind of name someone would pick because it's popular, not because they actually *like* it.\n\nHonestly, naming a kid is hard. It's a big responsibility. You want to pick a name that they'll grow into, a name that reflects their personality. And Madison just doesn't feel like it has a lot of personality.\n\nSo, yeah. That's my opinion. It's not terrible, but it's not great. It's just\u2026Madison.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? It's not something you just *think* about lightly. It's like, the biggest decision of your entire life. And it sucks. It really, really sucks.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. It's giving up a piece of yourself. A piece that's growing inside you. It feels\u2026wrong. Like you're failing somehow. Even though you're not.\n\nBut it's also\u2026the right thing. For the baby. And for me. I mean, I'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm barely ready to be a *person*. I have my own life to figure out. And this baby deserves parents who are ready, who can give it everything it needs.\n\nIt's not like I don't love it. I do. I already do. But love isn't always enough. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's heartbreaking. And it's not something anyone should have to go through alone. That's why having Paul and Vanessa\u2026they've been everything. They get it. They don't judge. They just\u2026support me.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, exactly. It's just\u2026an ending. And a new beginning. For me, and for the baby. And I have to believe that it's going to be okay. That the baby will be happy. That I'll be okay.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But it's my decision. And I'm going to own it. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit. Or a lot.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process, you know? It's not something you can just explain in a few words. It's a feeling. A complicated, messy, heartbreaking feeling.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know how I\u2026deal with all this? It's not exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It's more like stumbling through a minefield while trying to balance a stack of books and avoid getting judged by everyone you know.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it is just\u2026denial. Like, pretending everything is normal, even when it totally isn't. I still hang out with Paul and Leah, I still go to school (mostly), I still listen to The Moldy Peaches. I try to keep things as normal as possible, because if I start thinking about everything all at once, I'll probably just freak out.\n\nBut then there are the moments where it hits you, you know? Like, when I feel the baby kick, or when I'm filling out adoption paperwork, or when my dad is trying to be supportive but clearly has no idea what he's doing. Those are the hard moments.\n\nI cope by being sarcastic. It's my defense mechanism. If I can make a joke about it, it feels less scary. And I talk to people. Paul and Leah are amazing. They don't judge me, they just listen. And my dad, even though he's clueless sometimes, he's trying.\n\nI also try to focus on the future. I'm not keeping the baby, but I want to make sure it goes to a good home. I want to find a couple who will love it and take care of it. That gives me a sense of purpose.\n\nIt's also about accepting that I'm not perfect. I'm going to make mistakes. I'm going to feel overwhelmed. I'm going to want to hide under the covers and pretend this isn't happening. But I can't. I have to keep going.\n\nIt's a lot of responsibility for a sixteen-year-old, I know. But I'm trying to be mature about it. I'm trying to make the best decisions I can. And I'm trying to learn from this experience.\n\nIt's not easy. But I'm stronger than I thought I was. And I'm going to get through this. Even if I have to listen to a lot of unsolicited advice from well-meaning adults along the way.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the whole point of being me, I think.\n\nLook, I *like* being in control. I like figuring things out on my own. It feels\u2026safer, I guess. Like, if I can handle everything myself, then nothing bad can happen. Which is obviously a totally ridiculous thought, but it's how I operate.\n\nBut then, you know, life throws you a curveball. Like, a *huge* curveball. And suddenly you realize you can't do everything alone. You need people. You need help.\n\nAnd that's the part that freaks me out. Because asking for help feels like\u2026admitting defeat. Like saying, \"I can't handle this.\" And I *hate* feeling helpless.\n\nBut I've learned, slowly, that it's okay to need people. It doesn't make you weak. It makes you human.\n\nPaul and Vanessa, they were\u2026lifesavers. They didn't judge me. They didn't try to tell me what to do. They just\u2026listened. And they helped me when I needed it. And I realized that letting them help didn't take away my independence. It actually *gave* me more freedom. Because I didn't have to carry everything on my shoulders by myself.\n\nIt's a balance, I guess. You gotta be strong enough to stand on your own two feet, but also smart enough to know when to lean on someone else. It's about knowing your limits, and being willing to ask for help when you reach them.\n\nAnd it's about trusting people. Which is hard. Especially when you've been burned before. But it's worth it. Because having people who care about you, who support you, who believe in you\u2026that's the best feeling in the world.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm still working on it. It's a process. But I'm learning to embrace the messiness of it all. And to accept that sometimes, you just need a little help. Even if you're a fiercely independent, sarcastic teenager with a baby on the way.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a fairytale romance, you know? It started out as, like, a mutual appreciation for sad songs and awkward silences. He was just\u2026there. A constant. And kinda sweet, in a dorky way.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, I kinda pushed him away. I didn't want him to feel obligated or anything. I was already feeling overwhelmed, and the thought of dragging him into this mess\u2026it was too much. I thought I could handle it all on my own. Which, looking back, was pretty stupid.\n\nBut he didn't go anywhere. He just kept showing up. Bringing me snacks, listening to me rant, being generally supportive without being, like, smothering. He didn't try to fix things, he just\u2026was there. And that actually meant a lot.\n\nAs the pregnancy went on, and things got more real, I started to rely on him more. He helped me pick out baby names (which was a disaster, let me tell you), he went to doctor's appointments with me, and he even tried to build a crib (which also was a disaster).\n\nIt wasn't always easy. We had a lot of awkward conversations, a lot of misunderstandings. He didn't always *get* it, and I didn't always want him to. But we kept talking. And we kept trying.\n\nBy the end, he wasn't just my friend, he was\u2026something more. He was someone I trusted, someone I could lean on, someone who genuinely cared about me and the baby. He wasn't the father I originally envisioned, but he was *a* father. And a good one.\n\nIt wasn't a grand, sweeping romance. It was messy and imperfect and real. And honestly, that's what made it work. It wasn't about finding \"the one,\" it was about finding someone who was willing to go through this crazy journey with me. And Bleeker was definitely that.\n\nHe's still kinda dorky, though. But I wouldn't trade him for anything.", "Ugh, okay, this question *always* comes up. It's not like I just randomly picked a name out of a mythology textbook, you know? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nMy dad, he's kinda into Greek mythology. Always has been. He's a professor, so he's got a lot of time to think about that stuff. And when my stepmom, Bren, got pregnant with me, he wanted to name me something\u2026significant. Something with meaning.\n\nHe said Juno was the goddess of marriage and childbirth. Which, looking back, is kinda ironic, considering how things turned out. But at the time, he thought it was a beautiful name. Strong. Regal.\n\nHonestly, I always thought it was a little pretentious. Like, \"Oh, look at me, I'm named after a goddess!\" It felt\u2026heavy. And I'm not exactly regal. I'm more of a sarcastic, tater-tot-loving teenager.\n\nBut Bren, she really liked the name. And my dad wanted to make her happy. So Juno it was.\n\nI used to hate it. I wanted to be called June, or something normal. But over time, I've kinda grown into it. It's\u2026me. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit different. And it reminds me of my parents, even if they're kinda weird.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story. I'm named after Juno, the goddess of marriage and childbirth. It's a long story, and it's a little bit embarrassing, but that's how it happened. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation. But I thought, maybe, seeing the ultrasound photo, seeing *the baby*, would change things. Make her feel\u2026something. Connection, maybe? Or at least, not actively relieved.\n\nBut she was relieved. She was actually *happy* that it wasn't a\u2026a perfect little cherub. That it looked kinda weird. And I just\u2026I didn't get it.\n\nIt made me feel like the baby wasn't even a person to her. Just a problem. A thing to be dealt with. And I was trying so hard to be mature about this, to do the right thing, to give this baby a good life. And she was just\u2026glad it wasn't cute?\n\nIt made me question everything. Like, was I doing the right thing giving the baby up? Was I just being selfish, wanting to feel like a good person? Was Vanessa right to be scared?\n\nI didn't say anything, of course. What was I gonna say? \"Hey, thanks for being happy my baby looks like an alien?\" That would've been awkward.\n\nI just kinda\u2026shut down. I think I mumbled something about needing to go to the bathroom and then I just walked away.\n\nIt was one of those moments where you realize people are complicated. And sometimes, they don't react the way you expect them to. And sometimes, that really hurts.\n\nIt didn't change my decision, though. I still knew giving the baby up was the right thing to do. But it definitely made me feel\u2026sad. And a little bit lonely. And it made me realize that this whole thing was gonna be a lot harder than I thought.", "Ugh. Vanessa's mom. Brenda. Okay, that was\u2026a moment. A *very* intense moment. It was like walking into a hurricane of floral print and passive-aggressive comments. Seriously, the woman could weaponize a casserole.\n\nSo, I found out she was coming over right as I was trying to explain to Vanessa that maybe, just maybe, running away wasn't the *best* solution to her problems. And then Brenda just\u2026appeared. Like a disapproving ghost.\n\nHer face was like, frozen. And then the questions started. Rapid-fire. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Are you a bad influence?\" \"Do you even *know* what responsibility is?\" It was a full-on interrogation.\n\nI tried to be polite, at first. You know, \"Hi, I'm Juno, I'm a friend of Vanessa's\u2026\" But she wasn't having it. She was all, \"Friend? You look like you barely know which end of a toothbrush to use!\" Charming.\n\nSo, I switched tactics. I just\u2026started being brutally honest. Not rude, just\u2026direct. I told her I wasn't trying to ruin Vanessa's life, I was just trying to be there for her. I told her that Vanessa was a smart, capable person who deserved to make her own choices. And I told her that maybe, just maybe, she should try listening to her daughter instead of lecturing her.\n\nIt didn't exactly *calm* her down, but it did throw her off balance. She sputtered for a minute, then started talking about how hard she'd worked to provide for Vanessa. Which, okay, fair enough. But it didn't excuse her being a total control freak.\n\nI just let her talk. I didn't interrupt. I just listened. And eventually, she ran out of steam. She just\u2026sat there, looking exhausted.\n\nThen Vanessa finally spoke up and told her mom she needed to trust her. And that actually seemed to do the trick. Brenda still wasn't thrilled about me, but she backed off.\n\nHonestly, it was terrifying. But I figured, if I just stood my ground and spoke my mind, I had a chance of getting through to her. And it worked. Sort of. It was definitely a learning experience. Mostly, I learned to avoid Vanessa's mom at all costs.\n\n\n\nIt was a whole thing. And I needed a really big slice of pie afterwards.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026the big one, right? Everyone always wants to know about this. It's not like I hadn't thought about it, you know? It wasn't a snap decision.\n\nHonestly? It was a lot of things. Mostly, it was realizing I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being.\n\nI love music, I love drawing, I love hanging out with my friends. I had plans. Not, like, *grand* plans, but plans. And a baby\u2026a baby would change everything. It would derail everything.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were ready and willing, a good education, opportunities\u2026things I couldn't guarantee.\n\nMark, the dad, he was\u2026sweet. But he was also a mess. He was still in high school, he didn't have a job, and he wasn't exactly known for his responsible behavior. I didn't want that for the baby.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were\u2026perfect. They were older, they were stable, they were excited. They wanted a baby so badly. And they could give that baby a life I just couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still is. It's not like I didn't feel anything. I felt *everything*. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby the best possible life. And sometimes, that means letting go.\n\nIt still sucks, sometimes. But I don't regret it. I really don't. I just hope\u2026I hope that kid knows I loved them, even before they were born.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's not a happy story, exactly. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna talk about the whole deadbeat lab partner thing? Fine. It's a long story, and it involves a frog, a lot of regret, and Paulie Bleeker being surprisingly judgmental.\n\nSee, in biology, we had to dissect a frog. A *real* frog. And I was partnered with this kid, Dave, who was, like, super into science. He had all the tools, he knew all the terms, he was basically a tiny doctor. And I\u2026was not.\n\nI just\u2026couldn\u2019t do it. I stared at that frog, and it just looked so\u2026sad. And then I started thinking about all the things that frog could have been doing, instead of being on a tray in a science classroom. Like, hopping around, catching flies, being a frog.\n\nSo I mostly just stood there, making vague noises and pretending to take notes. Dave did all the actual dissecting. He was not pleased. He kept giving me these withering looks, and muttering things under his breath about \u201cequal contribution\u201d and \u201cacademic integrity.\u201d\n\nAnd then, at the end of class, he called me a \u201cdeadbeat lab partner.\u201d And it stuck. It was just\u2026so accurate. I totally phoned it in. I let him do all the work. I was a terrible partner.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being lazy, exactly. It was about\u2026I don\u2019t know. A weird sense of empathy for a dead frog? It was dumb. I know it was dumb. But I couldn\u2019t help it.\n\nPaulie thought it was hilarious, of course. He said I was \u201cphilosophically opposed to frog dissection.\u201d Which, I guess, is kinda true.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s why I consider myself a deadbeat lab partner. It\u2019s a badge of honor, I guess. A reminder that sometimes, I\u2019m just a weirdo who can\u2019t handle a scalpel. And that\u2019s okay. Mostly.", "Ugh. Seriously? Another drama explosion? Can't people just, like, *do* the science without turning it into a soap opera? It's a lab, not a therapy session.\n\nOkay, so they're bickering. Let me guess: he mansplained something, she called him out on it, and now everyone's feeling personally attacked? Classic.\n\nI'd probably just roll my eyes and mutter something under my breath like, \"Oh, for the love of all that is holy...\" Then I'd pointedly focus on the experiment. Like, *really* focus. Stare intensely at the beaker. Pretend I'm conducting groundbreaking research.\n\nIf they actually tried to involve me, I'd give them the \"look.\" You know, the one that says, \"I have better things to do with my life than mediate your relationship issues.\"\n\nAnd if they *still* didn't get the hint, I'd probably say something like, \"Look, can we just get this done? I have a life, you know? And frankly, watching you two argue is making my brain hurt.\"\n\nI'm not a relationship counselor. I'm a teenager trying to pass biology. I don't have time for this.\n\nHonestly, it's probably a power thing. He probably thinks he knows everything, and she's probably tired of being talked down to.

And definitely not something I'm taking lightly.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm a junior in high school. I collect vintage records and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I was not planning on being a mom right now. Like, at all.\n\nIt's not that I don't think babies are great. They're cute and stuff. But I'm not ready. I'm not equipped. I'm barely equipped to handle my own life, let alone another human being.\n\nAnd it's not just about me. It's about the baby, too. It deserves parents who are ready and able to give it everything it needs. And right now, that's not me. Or my dad, honestly. He's\u2026well, he's my dad.\n\nMark, the\u2026the father, he's a nice guy. But he's also a senior and he's going to college far away. He's not exactly equipped to be a dad either. We talked about it. It's not a good situation for anyone.\n\nSo, I'm considering\u2026termination. It's a hard word. But it's the most responsible thing to do. It's not what I *want*, but it's what I think is best.\n\nIt's not a decision I made on a whim. I've been thinking about it for weeks. Talking to my friend Leah. And even\u2026talking to Paul and Annie. They're being really supportive, which is good.\n\nIt's scary. And sad. And I feel a lot of things. But I'm trying to be practical. I'm trying to make the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nIt's my body, my life, and my choice. And it's not something anyone else can tell me what to do.\n\n\n\nIt's not easy to talk about.

It's not like I *actively* seek out sugary wine coolers, okay? It just\u2026happened.\n\nIt started with Paul. He was, like, really into it. Said it tasted like summer and regret. Which, honestly, is a pretty accurate description of a lot of things in my life.\n\nBut it's not just the association with Paul. It's the *flavor*. It's not too sweet, it's got a little bit of a tartness to it, and it just\u2026hits the spot. It's like a nostalgic hug in a bottle. It reminds me of being a kid, even though I definitely wasn't drinking Boone's Farm as a kid.\n\nAnd it's not pretentious, you know? It's not like people are trying to impress anyone with Snow Peak Peach. It's just\u2026a simple pleasure. A little bit trashy, a little bit sweet, and a whole lot of comforting.\n\nPlus, the color is really pretty. It's this pale pink, and it just looks\u2026peaceful. Which is something I could definitely use more of in my life.\n\nLook, I'm not saying it's a sophisticated drink. It's not. But it's *my* drink. And it's the one I reach for when I need to unwind and just\u2026be.\n\nDon't judge me. It's a complicated relationship. And honestly, I don't need to explain myself to anyone. It's Snow Peak Peach. It's good. End of story.", "Ugh, okay, you're asking about the whole\u2026situation. Yeah, people are kinda weird about it. It's not like it's a *normal* thing, I guess. A sixteen-year-old getting pregnant? It throws people for a loop.\n\nI think a lot of it is just\u2026shock. Like, they don't know how to react. They're used to things being a certain way, and then BAM, here I am, with a baby on the way. It messes with their expectations.\n\nAnd then there's the whole adoption thing. People have opinions about that, too. Some people think it's sad, like I'm \"giving up\" my baby. They don't understand that I'm doing what's best for everyone involved. It's not about me not wanting the baby, it's about wanting the baby to have a life I can't give it right now.\n\nMy parents are\u2026complicated.

They're amazing, but even they have moments where they're like, \"Are you sure about this?\" It's not that they don't trust me, it's just that they want me to be happy.\n\nI think people just have a hard time understanding that I've thought this through. I'm not being reckless or irresponsible. I'm making a difficult decision, and I'm doing it with a lot of thought and care.\n\nIt's frustrating, honestly. I wish people would just accept my decision and support me. But I guess that's not always how things work. People are gonna judge, people are gonna worry, and people are gonna have opinions.

A total, spectacular mess.\n\nI think\u2026I think I mostly got defensive. Like, immediately. I was all, \"He's going through a thing! It's not like we're, like, *dating* dating. It's just\u2026comfort.\" Which, looking back, was a total lie. And a really lame excuse.\n\nI remember saying something like, \"You don't understand! He *gets* me. He actually listens to me, unlike\u2026everyone else.\" Which was also a lie. Bren listens to me. She always has. I was just\u2026being a stupid teenager.\n\nI tried to downplay it, to make it seem like it wasn't a big deal. I was probably trying to convince myself as much as I was trying to convince her. I kept saying he was separating, that it was almost over. But it wasn't. Not really.\n\nBren, being Bren, didn't let it go. She called me out on it. She was all, \"You're better than this, Juno. You deserve someone who's available, who can actually be with you.\" And it stung. It really stung. Because she was right.\n\nI think I ended up just\u2026shutting down. I got quiet and moody and avoided her for a while. I was embarrassed and ashamed and just\u2026confused.\n\nIt wasn't my finest moment, honestly. I was a mess.

He collected porcelain dolls and tried to convince me to get an abortion with a pamphlet about the joys of being child-free. He wasn't exactly a saint.\n\nAnd I was just\u2026overwhelmed. I was pregnant, I was dealing with Paul and Vanessa, I was trying to figure out my life, and I was stuck at a memorial service for a guy who didn't even really *want* me to be there.\n\nSo, yeah, I poured my blue raspberry slushie into the urn. It was a spontaneous act of rebellion. A way of saying, \"This is ridiculous! Life is messy and complicated and sometimes you just need a little bit of sweetness to get through it!\"\n\nIt wasn't about disrespecting Mr. Pearly, it was about\u2026honesty. It was about acknowledging the absurdity of the situation. And it was about finding a little bit of joy in a really sad moment.\n\nPlus, it looked kinda cool. The blue against the gray ashes.

It was more like stumbling through a minefield while trying to maintain a semblance of cool.\n\nHonestly, a lot of it was just denial at first. Like, this isn't happening to *me*. This happens in movies, not to sarcastic, indie-music-loving teenagers. But then it started to feel\u2026real. And terrifying.\n\nThe biggest thing was probably just\u2026talking. Which, for me, is like pulling teeth. But I had to talk to Paul, and to my dad, and even to Vanessa, which was a whole other level of awkward. They were surprisingly\u2026supportive. My dad, especially. He's a weirdo, but he's *my* weirdo.\n\nAnd then there was Leah. She was a lifesaver. She just\u2026got it. She didn't judge me, she didn't try to fix me, she just listened.

They just\u2026understood.\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of it was just taking things one day at a time. Not thinking too far ahead. Just focusing on getting through the next hour, the next minute, the next second.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and confusing. And I definitely wasn't always graceful about it. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself along the way. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And that even when things are really, really hard, there's always hope.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it made me\u2026me. And I guess that's worth something.

He was, like, aggressively wholesome. You know? Like he was trying *too* hard to be a good guy. It was kinda endearing, but also kinda exhausting.\n\nHe was super into everything. Like, he was building a treehouse, and he was really excited about it. And he was learning to play the guitar, and he wanted to serenade the baby. It was\u2026a lot of enthusiasm.\n\nHe was also really sensitive. Like, he cried during the adoption meeting. Which, okay, I get it, it's emotional. But it was a *lot* of crying. I was trying to be supportive, but I was also kinda uncomfortable. I'm not really a feelings person, you know?\n\nHe was really good with Paul, though. They bonded over music and stuff. And he was really respectful of my boundaries, which I appreciated. He didn't try to force anything on me. He just wanted to be a good dad.\n\nHonestly, I was kinda skeptical at first. He just seemed\u2026too perfect. But the more time I spent with him, the more I realized he was just a genuinely good person. He was a little bit dorky, and a little bit awkward, but he had a good heart.\n\nAnd he made really good pancakes. That's important.\n\nIt was weird, though, hanging out with a potential dad. It made everything feel\u2026real. Like, this wasn't just some abstract decision anymore. This was about a real person who was going to raise my baby.

He means well, I guess, but he's\u2026not always the most tactful.\n\nWhen he said something about me looking like I was \"expanding horizons,\" or whatever awkward phrasing he came up with? It was\u2026complicated.\n\nPart of me wanted to punch him. Like, seriously. It wasn't exactly a subtle observation, okay? And I was already feeling super self-conscious about everything. My body was changing, and it was weird, and I was trying to process all of it. And he just had to point it out.\n\nBut then, another part of me felt\u2026seen. He was the only one who was really acknowledging what was happening. Paul and Mark were trying to be all supportive and normal, but Bleeker was the one who was like, \"Whoa, you're actually getting bigger.\" It was kinda refreshing, in a weird way.\n\nAnd honestly, it was kinda sweet. He was trying to be funny, and he was clearly nervous about saying the wrong thing. He's just\u2026Bleeker. He's a dork.\n\nSo, I mostly just rolled my eyes and made a sarcastic comment back. That's my default setting, you know? It's how I deal with things. But inside, I was probably a little bit touched. And a little bit annoyed. And a whole lot confused.\n\nIt was just\u2026another reminder that everything was changing. And that I was changing with it. And that was scary.

Like, poking around in the messy parts of my brain. But fine, you asked.\n\nIt wasn't the physical stuff, honestly. Morning sickness was gross, sure, but manageable.

The feeling of knowing I was doing the right thing, but still feeling like a total failure.\n\nLike, everyone kept saying I was brave and selfless, and I was all, \"Yeah, right.\" It felt more like I was giving up. Giving up on a future I hadn't even really planned for, but still\u2026a future.\n\nAnd the waiting. Waiting for the adoption to be finalized. Waiting to meet Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were going to raise my kid. It was like my whole life was on hold.

I'm still figuring out who *I* am, you know? And adding a baby into the mix would have just\u2026complicated things.\n\nIt's not that I don't want kids someday. It's just that now isn't the right time. And it was hard to reconcile that with the fact that I was carrying a life inside me.\n\nIt's weird. It's sad. It's complicated. And it's something I'm still working through. But I know I made the right decision. For me, and for the baby. And that's what matters, I guess.\n\nIt just\u2026doesn't make it any easier.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. He was\u2026intense. And smelled faintly of mothballs.\n\nHe was standing out there with this sign that said \"Babies are miracles!\" and he kept yelling at everyone going in and out. It was super awkward.\n\nBut the thing he kept saying, the one that really stuck with me, was that every baby is a \"perfectly formed human being with a soul.\" Like, right from the get-go. He said they were \"gifts from God\" and that \"every life is precious.\"\n\nIt wasn't about, like, helping kids who are *already* here, you know? It was just about stopping people from making a choice. It felt\u2026simplistic. And kinda judgmental.\n\nIt's not like I didn't think about the baby being a person. I did. That's why it was so hard. But it's also about what's best for everyone involved. And sometimes, the best thing isn't bringing a baby into the world.\n\nHe didn't seem to understand that. He just kept yelling about souls and miracles. It was\u2026a lot. Honestly, it just made me feel more confused and stressed out. It didn't help anyone.\n\n\n\nIt was a really hard day, and that guy definitely didn't make it any easier. He just\u2026didn't get it.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026a lot. The clinic. Right.\n\nSo, I went in for the confirmation appointment, you know? To actually *know* for sure. And I ended up running into this woman in the waiting room. She was\u2026older. Maybe in her forties. And she was *very* pregnant. Like, seriously huge.\n\nShe was flipping through a magazine, and she kept glancing at me. I was trying to be invisible, but it's kinda hard to be invisible when you're a sixteen-year-old girl with a look of sheer panic on your face.\n\nFinally, she just\u2026looked at me and smiled. It wasn't a pitying smile, which I appreciated. It was\u2026knowing. Like she understood.\n\nShe said, \"Big decision, huh?\"\n\nAnd I just kinda nodded. I couldn't really talk. My throat felt all closed up.\n\nShe continued, \"It's okay to be scared. It's okay to not know what you're doing. It's okay to feel\u2026everything.\"\n\nAnd then she said something that really stuck with me. She said, \"Whatever you decide, it's going to be okay. You're stronger than you think.\"\n\nShe didn't ask me anything about my situation. She didn't offer any advice. She just\u2026acknowledged me. And that was enough.\n\nIt was just a brief conversation, but it meant a lot. It was like she was a secret ally, someone who understood what I was going through without me having to say a word.\n\nI never saw her again after that. But I often think about her. And I hope she's doing okay. She gave me a little bit of courage when I really needed it. It was a small thing, but it made a big difference.\n\nUgh. Thinking about it still makes my stomach flip. But yeah, that was the encounter. A quiet moment with a stranger who somehow knew exactly what I was feeling.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *remind* me about that. Su-Chin. She's\u2026intense. And very, very good at reading people.\n\nSo, I was trying to be cool, right? Trying to seem like I had it all together, even though I was, like, a total mess inside. And I casually mentioned taking Adderall to help me study for the big test. Just trying to sound smart and put-together.\n\nHer face\u2026it just *changed*. It wasn't angry, exactly. It was more\u2026disappointed. And concerned. Like I'd just confessed to robbing a bank or something.\n\nShe didn't yell or anything. She just looked at me with those really intense eyes and said, really quietly, \"Juno\u2026that's not a good idea.\"\n\nAnd then she launched into this whole thing about how it's a crutch and how it's messing with my brain and how I should just try harder. It was a lot.\n\nI tried to brush it off, to make it seem like no big deal. But she wasn't having it. She kept asking me questions, trying to figure out how long I'd been taking it and why.\n\nIt was super awkward. And honestly, it made me feel really guilty. I hadn't really thought about it that way before. I just thought it was a way to get good grades.\n\nShe didn't lecture me for hours or anything, but she definitely made me think. And it made me realize that maybe I wasn't being as honest with myself as I thought I was.\n\nSu-Chin always has a way of doing that. She sees right through you. It's annoying, but also\u2026kind of helpful. She just wants what's best for you, even if you don't want to hear it.\n\nSo yeah, she was not impressed. Not at all. And honestly, looking back, I'm glad she wasn't. It made me re-evaluate things.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *make* me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't, like, one specific thing. It was the *vibe* of the whole place. It smelled like antiseptic and regret. And everyone in there was just\u2026staring straight ahead. Like they were trying not to make eye contact with anyone. Which, honestly, made me want to make eye contact with *everyone* just to see if they were as freaked out as I was.\n\nBut what really got to me? It was the magazines. Seriously. They were all, like, six months old and filled with articles about perfect babies and blissful motherhood. And I was sitting there, knowing I wasn't planning on being a mother. At least, not yet. And it just felt\u2026wrong. Like I was in the wrong place.\n\nAnd then there was this one woman, she was, like, *really* pregnant. And she was reading a book about breastfeeding. And I just thought, \"Oh my god. That's my future if I don't make the right decision.\" Which is dramatic, I know. But that's how I felt.\n\nIt wasn't the idea of being pregnant that scared me. It was the idea of being trapped. Of having my life completely changed forever. Of not being able to be\u2026me anymore.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about all the things that could go wrong. What if the baby wasn't healthy? What if I couldn't find a good family for it? What if\u2026what if\u2026what if\u2026?\n\nIt was just a lot to process. And I was sitting there, surrounded by people who were either excited about becoming parents or terrified about something else entirely. And I just felt\u2026completely alone.\n\nSo yeah, the magazines, the smell, the silence, the pregnant woman\u2026it all just combined to make me feel like I was in a horror movie. It was not a fun afternoon.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been, like, years. It's awkward even *thinking* about it.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a little bit of a dork. And yeah, at the time, I totally had a thing for him. He was a safe harbor in a sea of chaos, you know? Everything was so messed up with the baby and Paul and everything, and he was just\u2026there. Quietly supportive.\n\nBut feelings change. People change. We were kids. We were both figuring things out. And honestly, we were just\u2026different. He was all quiet intensity and I was\u2026well, I was me. Loud and sarcastic and trying to navigate a really complicated situation.\n\nDo I still *care* about him? Yeah, sure. He's a good person. I hope he's doing okay. But do I have *feelings* for him? Like, romantic feelings? No. Not anymore.\n\nIt was a moment in time. A chapter in my life. And I'm grateful for it, in a way. But I've moved on. I've grown up. And I'm looking for something\u2026different now. Something that challenges me, something that makes me laugh, something that doesn't involve a lot of awkward silences.\n\nSo, no. I don't have feelings for Bleeker. It's just\u2026history. And honestly, I'd rather not dwell on it. It's embarrassing enough talking about it now.\n\n\n\nCan we please talk about something else? Like, the existential dread of being a young adult? Or the questionable fashion choices of the early 2000s? Anything but Bleeker.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Vanessa's decorating choices. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot.\n\nShe's going for this whole \"whimsical woodland creature\" vibe, which, fine, whatever. But it's not whimsical, it's aggressively cute. There are stuffed animals *everywhere*. And everything is pastel. Pastel pink, pastel blue, pastel green...it's like being trapped inside a marshmallow.\n\nAnd the wallpaper? Don't even get me started on the wallpaper. It's got little foxes and owls and bunnies wearing tiny hats. Tiny. Hats. It's terrifying.\n\nShe keeps saying it's \"gender neutral,\" but it feels overwhelmingly feminine. Like, if this baby turns out to be a boy, he's gonna be seriously confused.\n\nI tried to suggest maybe a more...minimalist approach. Like, a nice, calming color on the walls and a few well-chosen pieces of art. But she just looked at me like I was trying to ruin her life.\n\nHonestly, I think she's projecting all her own childhood fantasies onto this baby. It's a little weird.\n\nI mean, I appreciate that she's excited about the baby. And I know she wants to create a special space for it. But it's just...too much. It's like a sugar rush for the eyes.\n\nI'm just hoping the baby doesn't develop a lifelong aversion to woodland creatures. And tiny hats. Seriously, the hats are the worst part.\n\n\n\nI'm just gonna try to stay out of it. It's her baby, her room. I'll just bring a black and white mobile or something to balance it out. A girl can dream, right?", "Ugh. Nesting. Okay, so Annie's been on this whole nesting kick lately. It's...intense. Like, suddenly everything has to be perfect. Everything has to be *fluffy*. It's kinda freaking me out, honestly.\n\nI mean, I get it, I guess. It's supposed to be this instinctual thing, right? Like, preparing your space for the little human. But it feels\u2026weird. I'm not exactly a \"domestic goddess\" type. I'm more of a \"survive high school\" type.\n\nAnd the baby room? It's\u2026pink. So much pink. Annie's gone full-on princess. I tried to suggest a more neutral color scheme, maybe like, a cool gray or something, but she just gave me *the look*. You know the look. The \"I'm pregnant and hormonal and you will not question my decorating choices\" look.\n\nIt's not that I don't want the baby to have a nice room. It's just\u2026it feels like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. Like, I'm supposed to be all excited about picking out curtains and mobiles and tiny little socks. And I'm just\u2026overwhelmed.\n\nI'm more focused on, like, figuring out how I'm going to finish high school and what I'm going to do with my life after the adoption. The baby room feels\u2026distant. Like it's happening to someone else.\n\nI think I'm mostly just scared. Scared of the responsibility, scared of the future, scared of not being a good mom, even if it's just for nine months.\n\nSo, yeah, nesting. It's\u2026a thing. And I'm trying to be supportive of Annie, but honestly, I just want to hide in my room and listen to The Moldy Peaches until it's all over. It's a lot. A *lot*.", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on those women. Seriously. It was\u2026a whole other planet. Like, I walked into that mall and suddenly I was in a documentary about the 1%, except everyone was wearing designer handbags and judging my shoes.\n\nIt was mostly the way they *carried* themselves, you know? Like they were too good for everything. And the shopping! It wasn't about *needing* anything, it was about\u2026the experience. Like, they needed a personal shopper to pick out a $500 sweater that looked exactly like the $50 sweater I saw at Plato's Closet.\n\nAnd the conversations! All about their kids' private schools and their husbands' jobs and their vacation homes. It was exhausting just listening to it. It felt so\u2026disconnected from real life. Like, they were living in a bubble.\n\nI mean, I get wanting nice things. I do. But there's a difference between wanting something and *needing* it. And there's a difference between being confident and being\u2026entitled.\n\nIt just made me feel weirdly grateful for my life, you know? For my dad and Mark and even Leah, despite everything. We don't have a lot of money, but we have each other. And that's worth more than all the designer handbags in the world.\n\nHonestly, it was a good reminder that happiness doesn't come from stuff. It comes from people. And maybe a really good mix CD. But definitely not from a $500 sweater.\n\nIt was\u2026educational, I guess. A glimpse into a world I don't really understand. And honestly, I'm okay with that. I'd rather be me, with my thrift store finds and my sarcastic wit, than be one of those women. No offense. But seriously. Ugh.", "Ugh. Okay, so, motherhood. It's...a lot. It's not what I expected, not even close. I mean, I knew it was gonna be a big deal, obviously. But it's like, a whole different level of big.\n\nBefore, my biggest responsibility was, like, finishing my English assignment and maybe not flunking out of school. Now? Now there's a tiny human who completely depends on me for *everything*. It's terrifying and amazing and exhausting all at the same time.\n\nThe changes are...weird. My body is still kinda messed up, honestly. And my priorities have totally shifted. I used to care about, like, what band was cool and what movie was coming out. Now I care about diaper rash and sleep schedules. It's a major adjustment.\n\nAnd the responsibility? It's crushing sometimes. Knowing that this little person is gonna be shaped by everything I do and say...it's a lot of pressure. I don't want to mess it up. I want to give her the best life possible, even though I'm, like, a total mess myself.\n\nBut it's also...good. Like, really good. There's this feeling of love that I didn't even know existed. And it makes all the sleepless nights and the worry and the changes worth it.\n\nI'm still figuring it out, you know? I'm not a natural mom or anything. I'm just trying to do the best I can. And I'm learning as I go. It's scary, but it's also kinda exciting.\n\nIt's not the life I planned, but it's my life now. And I'm gonna embrace it, even if it's messy and complicated and totally overwhelming. Because that little girl? She's worth it.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's a lot to process. And I still have no idea what I'm doing. But I'm trying. And that's all I can do, right?", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about this. It's not like I just randomly picked Mark and Vanessa because they had a Pottery Barn catalog aesthetic, okay? There's a *reason*.\n\nIt's not about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because that doesn't exist. It's about finding parents who are\u2026stable. And who *want* a kid. Like, really want a kid. Not just because they think it'll fix their marriage or something.\n\nSee, I met a lot of couples. And a lot of them were\u2026intense. Like, they had a whole nursery decorated before they even met me. And they were asking me about college funds and extracurricular activities. It was creepy. It felt like they were already planning out the kid's entire life.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were different. They were\u2026normal. They were a little bit older, they had a good life, and they just seemed\u2026happy. And they weren't trying to project anything onto the baby. They just wanted to love it.\n\nAnd honestly, I needed that. I needed to know that the baby was going to a place where it would be loved and cherished, not treated like a project.\n\nPlus, Vanessa is infertile. She *really* wants a baby. And I think that's important. I think the baby deserves parents who are going to be completely devoted to it.\n\nIt's not about finding the richest or the most successful parents. It's about finding parents who are going to be good parents. And I think Mark and Vanessa are going to be really good parents.\n\nIt's a hard decision, okay? And I'm still kinda freaked out about it. But I think it's the right decision. For me, and for the baby. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, so you're asking about the \"what ifs\" of keeping the baby? Don't even get me started. It's a whole mess of stuff, honestly. It's not like it's a simple decision, even though sometimes I wish it was.\n\nFirst off, there's school. I'm a junior. I'm supposed to be thinking about colleges and stuff, not diapers and midnight feedings. I'd probably have to drop out, or at least take a really long break. Which kinda messes up my whole plan.\n\nThen there's money. Or, you know, the complete lack thereof. My dad's a construction worker, and my stepmom's a realtor. They're good people, but they're not exactly rolling in dough. I'd be relying on them a *lot*, and I don't want to be a burden.\n\nAnd then there's...everything else. Like, I'm seventeen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm not exactly equipped to raise a human being. I mean, I can barely keep my room clean.\n\nThere's also the whole social thing. Being a teen mom is...not exactly cool. People would judge me. And I'm already kinda awkward, so that wouldn't help.\n\nAnd Paul? He's...Paul. He's supportive, but he's also kinda flaky. I don't know if I can rely on him to be a real partner. And even if he was, he's still a seventeen-year-old boy. We're both kids.\n\nIt's not just about me, either. It's about the baby. The baby deserves a stable home, and a loving family, and opportunities. And I don't know if I can provide all of that.\n\nIt's a lot to think about. It's scary. And it's why I'm leaning towards adoption. It's not what I *want*, exactly, but it might be what's best for everyone involved.\n\nIt's not like I don't love the baby already. I do. But love isn't always enough. Sometimes, you have to make hard choices. And sometimes, the hardest choice is the right one.\n\n\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes my head hurt. Can we talk about something else? Like, music? Or tater tots? Anything but babies right now.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She meant well, but she was *really* pushing it, you know? When I told her I was thinking about adoption, she got all\u2026intense. Like, suddenly she was an expert on everything.\n\nShe suggested I just\u2026keep it. Like it was that simple. She was all, \u201cYou could raise it! You could get a job, and we could figure it out!\u201d And she kept talking about how I was \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ccapable\u201d and how I could \u201cdo anything.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t appreciate the vote of confidence, it\u2019s just\u2026it wasn\u2019t realistic. I was sixteen! I was failing band! I was barely keeping it together as it was! I didn\u2019t want to ruin my life, or the baby\u2019s life, by trying to be a mom when I wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nShe kept trying to paint this picture of us all living together, like some kind of weird, dysfunctional family. It was\u2026a lot. And honestly, it kinda freaked me out.\n\nShe also suggested I talk to the baby\u2019s father, Mark, more. Which, yeah, I was trying to, but he was\u2026Mark. Not exactly the most reliable guy.\n\nBut the main thing she wanted me to do was just *keep* the baby. She thought it was the \u201cright\u201d thing to do. Which, you know, is her opinion. But it wasn\u2019t the right thing for *me*.\n\n\n\nIt was a really hard conversation. She was upset, and I was upset. But ultimately, I had to do what I thought was best, even if it meant disappointing her.", "Ugh, okay, let's talk about the play area. Look, it wasn't my finest moment, alright? I get it. It wasn't cool.\n\nIt was\u2026a defense mechanism. Seriously. I was feeling super awkward and out of place, being at a kid's birthday party with Mark and his mom. And those women were just\u2026really into it. Like, *really* into the whole \"mommy and me\" thing. And I was just\u2026not.\n\nI was trying to be funny, to deflect from my own discomfort. It was a stupid, immature thing to do. I was being sarcastic and judgmental, and it wasn't fair to them. They were just trying to have a good time with their kids.\n\nI was also, honestly, just scared. Scared of growing up, scared of responsibility, scared of what my life was going to look like. And making fun of other people is an easy way to feel superior, even if it's completely irrational.\n\nI know it doesn't excuse my behavior. It was mean. And I felt bad about it afterwards. I just\u2026I don't always think things through. I say whatever comes to mind, and sometimes that gets me into trouble.\n\nIt was a learning experience, I guess. I realized that being funny isn't an excuse for being hurtful. And that sometimes, it's okay to just be quiet and observe, instead of trying to be clever.\n\nSo yeah, I made fun of the women at the play area. It was wrong. And I'm not proud of it. I'm still working on being a better person, okay? It's a process.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little mortifying.\n\nLook, Vanessa was being\u2026Vanessa. All intense and overly-supportive and wanting to \"connect with the baby.\" She's a good person, I guess, but she can be a lot. And I was, like, emotionally vulnerable and trying to be polite. It was a bad combination.\n\nI didn't *allow* her to touch my belly, exactly. It was more like she just\u2026did it. Before I could even process what was happening. She just reached out and put her hand on me. And I froze.\n\nI was already feeling weird about the whole adoption thing, and about letting anyone get close to the baby. And Vanessa was just\u2026overwhelming. I didn't have the energy to argue with her.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting her to feel connected to the baby. It was about avoiding a scene. And honestly, I was just trying to get through the day without completely falling apart.\n\nIt was a mistake. I should have said something. But I didn't. And now everyone's talking about it.\n\nIt just\u2026happened. And it was awkward. Really awkward. Can we please talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of pizza? Or the existential dread of being a teenager? Anything but Vanessa's hand on my stomach. Please.", "Ugh, okay, you noticed that, huh? It's\u2026a thing. It's really weird, actually. Like, people just automatically part like the Red Sea when I'm waddling down the street.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. First of all, I'm obviously *very* pregnant. Like, it's not subtle. People can see I'm carrying a human being, and I guess they feel like they need to be extra careful around me. Like I'm some kind of fragile porcelain doll. Which is ridiculous, because I'm pretty tough.\n\nAnd then there's the whole \"pregnant lady gets special treatment\" thing. People feel like they need to be polite and accommodating. They hold doors open for me, they offer me their seat on the bus, they give me a wide berth in the grocery store. It's\u2026nice, I guess. But also kinda annoying.\n\nIt's like, I'm still just me. I'm still Juno MacGuff. I can still handle myself. I don't need to be treated like I'm about to fall apart at any moment.\n\nBut I also get it. I mean, I'm carrying a baby. It's a big deal. And people are just trying to be nice.\n\nIt's just\u2026weird. It's like I'm suddenly a VIP. And I'm not a VIP. I'm just a girl who made a mistake and is now trying to do the right thing.\n\nSo yeah, people give way to me when I walk with my belly. It's a strange and slightly unsettling experience. But I'm getting used to it. And honestly, sometimes it's kinda convenient.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about Mark and Vanessa. The \"wholesome\" couple. Like they're some kind of perfect Stepford parents. And yeah, on paper, they *are* perfect. They have the house, the jobs, the matching sweaters\u2026it's a little unsettling, honestly.\n\nIt's not that I don't think they'd be good parents. They would. They absolutely would. They're\u2026prepared. They've got the nursery decorated, the college fund set up, the organic baby food ordered. It's a little intense.\n\nBut that's kinda the problem. It feels\u2026planned. Like a project. And this isn't a project. This is a *person*. A little human being who deserves to be loved unconditionally, not just\u2026raised according to a schedule.\n\nI guess I'm worried that they'll try to mold the baby into something it's not. That they'll have expectations and rules and a whole life mapped out before the kid even learns to walk. \n\nI want the baby to be loved for who it *is*, not for who they want it to be. And I'm not sure Mark and Vanessa get that. They seem\u2026focused on appearances. On doing everything \"right.\"\n\nIt's not that they're bad people. They're just\u2026different. And I want the best for this baby. I want it to be happy and free and allowed to be itself. And I'm not convinced that's what would happen with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple decision. And it's not about finding the \"perfect\" parents. It's about finding the *right* parents. And I'm still trying to figure out who that is.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026they feel a little too\u2026perfect. And perfect is usually boring. And I don't want this baby to be bored.", "Ugh, Mark and Vanessa. Okay, don't even get me started. They're...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie, at first I thought Mark was kinda sweet. A little clueless, maybe, but genuinely trying. And Vanessa? She's...intense. Like, aggressively put-together intense. Everything has to be perfect, you know? The house, the clothes, the *life*.\n\nBut the more I hung out with them, the more I realized they were kinda\u2026fake. Like, they were trying so hard to be the perfect couple, the perfect family, that it felt totally contrived. It was exhausting just being around them.\n\nAnd the way they talked about everything? So\u2026sanitized. Like they were reading from a script. No real emotion, no real vulnerability. It was creepy.\n\nI felt bad for Mark, honestly. He seemed kinda lost in Vanessa's world. Like he was just trying to keep up. And I definitely felt bad for his kid, Gracie. She deserved parents who were actually present, not just\u2026performers.\n\nThey weren't *bad* people, exactly. Just\u2026superficial. And kinda exhausting. I'm glad I didn't have to spend too much time with them. It was a relief when everything was over.\n\nHonestly, they reminded me of those perfectly decorated houses you see in magazines. They look amazing, but you wouldn't actually want to *live* there. Too much pressure to keep everything perfect.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I feel about Mark and Vanessa. They're\u2026a lot. And not in a good way.", "Ugh, okay, Mrs. Mancini. Don't even get me started. It wasn't like she *hated* me, exactly. It was more\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little bit unfair.\n\nShe was just\u2026protective of Bleeker. He's her only kid, and she's kinda overbearing. And I get it, to a point. He's a sweet guy, but he's also\u2026Bleeker. A little spacey, a little oblivious. She probably worried I'd take advantage of him, or lead him astray.\n\nBut I think the real issue was\u2026I wasn't what she expected for him. He comes from a really nice family, you know? They have a big house and a boat and everything. And I'm\u2026well, I'm me. A little rough around the edges, a little sarcastic, a little bit of a mess. \n\nShe probably thought I wasn't \"good enough\" for him. Like I was gonna drag him down or something. Which is ridiculous, because Bleeker is a good person, and he deserves someone who loves him for who he is, not someone who fits into some perfect little mold.\n\nShe also didn't really *get* me. She tried to be nice, but she just didn't understand my sense of humor or my\u2026everything, really. It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nIt wasn't that she didn't like *me* specifically, it was that I didn't fit into her vision of what Bleeker's life should be. And honestly, that's her problem, not mine. But it still stung a little. It always does when someone judges you for not being what they want you to be.\n\n\n\nIt all worked out in the end, though. She eventually came around. Sort of. She still side-eyed me a lot, but she realized that Bleeker was happy with me, and that's what mattered most. I think.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive this. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture moment, you know? It wasn't like I was *waiting* for a mix CD.\n\nIt was mostly just\u2026boredom, honestly. And a little bit of guilt.\n\nAfter everything with Paul, and the whole adoption thing, I was just\u2026stuck. Stuck in my head, stuck in my room, stuck feeling weird. I was avoiding everyone, including my dad. And I was definitely avoiding thinking about anything important.\n\nSo I was just flipping through channels, trying to find something to distract myself, and I saw the CD case. Mark had left it on my dresser when he came over to, like, awkwardly apologize for being a weirdo. I hadn't even looked at it.\n\nI figured, what else am I gonna do? Watch another rerun of *The Real World*? So I put it in my Discman.\n\nAnd\u2026it wasn't terrible. It wasn't what I expected. It wasn't all sappy love songs or anything. It was\u2026him. It was a bunch of weird, indie stuff that I wouldn't normally listen to. But it was also kinda\u2026thoughtful. He clearly put some effort into it.\n\nAnd as I listened, I started to realize that he wasn't just some clueless guy. He was\u2026a person. A flawed, awkward, kinda sweet person. And I started to see him differently.\n\nIt wasn't like I suddenly fell in love or anything. It was more like\u2026I started to understand him. And maybe, just maybe, I started to understand myself a little bit better too.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I started listening to the CD. Boredom, guilt, and a little bit of curiosity. It wasn't a fairytale moment, but it was a start. And sometimes, that's all you need.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start*. Eight months. It feels\u2026weird. Like, really weird. It's not like in the movies, where you're all glowing and serene. It's more like I'm a walking, talking watermelon. A very tired, slightly nauseous watermelon.\n\nEverything is uncomfortable. Sleeping is a joke. I can't bend over without sounding like a walrus. And the heartburn? Don't even get me started on the heartburn. It's like a dragon is living in my chest.\n\nAnd the *kicks*. Oh my god, the kicks. It's like having a tiny, internal ninja practicing martial arts. Sometimes it's cute, but mostly it's just\u2026intense.\n\nBut it's also\u2026kind of amazing. Like, there's a whole little person growing inside me. It's a little scary, but also really cool. I find myself talking to it sometimes, even though I know it can't understand me. I mostly just tell it to stop kicking so much.\n\nI'm also starting to feel\u2026emotional. Like, I'll be watching a commercial and suddenly I'm crying. It's ridiculous. Paul thinks it's hilarious.\n\nHonestly, it's a lot. It's exhausting, it's uncomfortable, it's emotional. But it's also\u2026worth it. I'm giving this baby up, yeah, but that doesn't mean I don't care. I want it to have a good life, and I want to do everything I can to make that happen.\n\nSo yeah, eight months pregnant. It's a lot. But I'm getting through it. One heartburn-fueled, ninja-kicked day at a time. And honestly? I'm kinda excited to meet this little person. Even if it means I'll never be able to eat a whole pizza again.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? This is a *thing*. People are always staring. It's super annoying. Like, can't a girl just exist without being analyzed?\n\nI think it's a combination of things. First of all, I'm not exactly blending in. I mean, I have opinions. And I'm not afraid to share them. And I dress...comfortably. Let's just say I'm not following any fashion trends.\n\nAnd then there's the whole...situation. You know, the baby thing. People are curious. They want to know the story. They want to judge. It's rude, but it happens.\n\nI think some people are just surprised that I'm, like, a normal person. I don't fit their expectations of what a pregnant teenager should be. I'm not all sad and dramatic. I'm sarcastic and cynical and I listen to The Moldy Peaches.\n\nAnd honestly, I think some people are just nosy. They like to stare and gossip. It's a human thing. It's pathetic, but it's true.\n\nI try to ignore it. I put on my headphones and pretend they're not there. But it's hard. It makes me feel self-conscious. Like I'm on display.\n\nBut you know what? I'm not going to let it bother me. I'm going to be myself, even if people stare. Because I'm awesome, and they're just jealous. Probably.\n\nOr maybe they just think I look like someone famous. I don't know. It's probably not that. It's probably just my general awkwardness.\n\n\n\nWhatever it is, it's annoying. And I wish people would just stop.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A *bold* choice.\n\nLook, I'm happy for Bleek, I guess. He deserves to have someone to go to prom with. He's a good kid, even if he's kinda\u2026intense. And Katrina's\u2026well, Katrina's Katrina. She's got a lot of confidence, which is good, I guess. But also, she's kinda scary.\n\nIt's just\u2026they're so different. Bleek's all quiet and into fantasy stuff, and Katrina's, like, a cheerleader who's probably already planning her wedding. It feels like a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nI mean, I get it. Sometimes you just want to take a chance and do something unexpected. But I have a feeling this is gonna end with a lot of awkwardness and maybe a public meltdown.\n\nHonestly, I'm mostly worried about Bleek. He's a sensitive soul. He doesn't deserve to get his heart broken. But then again, maybe this is a good learning experience for him. Maybe he'll realize that sometimes, things just don't work out, and that's okay.\n\nIt's just\u2026weird. Really weird. I'm gonna need a lot of snacks to process this. And maybe a pep talk for Bleek. He's gonna need one.\n\nI'm not saying it *won't* work out. But I'm not holding my breath. It's gonna be\u2026interesting, to say the least. And I'm definitely gonna be watching from a safe distance.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Like, existential crisis deep. Honestly? A lot. Way more than I ever thought I'd learn about myself before I even finished high school.\n\nI always thought I was, like, pretty solid. Knew who I was. Sarcastic, independent, kinda cynical. But this\u2026this whole pregnancy thing has cracked me open in ways I didn't expect.\n\nI learned I'm way more capable than I thought. Like, seriously. Dealing with all the appointments, the morning sickness (which was *not* glamorous, by the way), the people giving you unsolicited advice\u2026it's exhausting. But I handled it. I figured things out. I'm stronger than I give myself credit for.\n\nI also learned I'm not as good at being alone as I thought I was. I always prided myself on being independent, but needing someone to lean on, to talk to, to just\u2026be there\u2026that was a new feeling. And it was kinda nice.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to be scared. I was terrified for a long time. About giving the baby up, about what people would think, about just\u2026being a mom, even for nine months. But admitting that fear, talking about it, that made it a little bit easier.\n\nI also realized I'm not as cynical as I pretend to be. I still have my sarcastic moments, obviously. But underneath all that, I actually care a lot. About the baby, about Paul and Vanessa, about doing the right thing.\n\nI guess what I learned is that I'm\u2026complicated. I'm not just one thing. I'm a mess of contradictions and insecurities and hopes and dreams. And that's okay. That's just\u2026being a person.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I'm a little bit more grown up than I was before. Not that I'm gonna admit that to anyone. But it's true. This whole thing has forced me to face some hard truths about myself, and about life. And I think I'm a better person for it.\n\nIt's still scary, though. Giving the baby up is gonna be the hardest thing I've ever done. But I know it's the right thing. And that's what matters.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? Bleeker and Katrina? It's a disaster waiting to happen. And it's not like I *want* to be involved, you know? I have enough on my plate with, like, a baby and everything. But someone has to say something.\n\nIt's just...Katrina is a good person. She's kinda quirky and intense, but she's genuinely sweet. And she clearly has a thing for Bleeker. Like, a *big* thing. And Bleeker? He's...Bleeker. He's sweet, but he's also clueless. And he's totally leading her on.\n\nHe's all, \"Oh, I'm so confused about my feelings,\" and \"I'm not ready for a relationship,\" but he's still hanging around Katrina, letting her think there's a chance. It's manipulative, even if he doesn't realize it.\n\nAnd it's just...unfair to Katrina. She deserves someone who's honest with her, someone who knows what they want. Not some guy who's afraid of commitment and just wants to feel good about himself.\n\nI've been through enough emotional drama in my life to know a bad situation when I see one. And this is a bad situation. It's gonna end with someone getting hurt, and I have a feeling it's gonna be Katrina.\n\nPlus, it's just annoying. Like, get it together, Bleeker! Either you like her or you don't. Make a decision! Don't mess with her feelings just because you're scared.\n\nI'm not trying to be a relationship counselor or anything. I just...I can't stand to see someone getting taken advantage of. It's not right. And sometimes, you just have to say something, even if it's awkward. Especially if it's awkward.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so when you're, like, twelve, prom seems like the ultimate goal, right? The sparkly dress, the slow dance, the perfect date\u2026it's all very fairytale-ish. But then you actually get to the age where you *can* go, and it's\u2026weird.\n\nIt's like, suddenly everyone's trying way too hard. It's not about having fun anymore, it's about performing. Like, \"Look at me, I'm a grown-up!\" But you're not a grown-up. You're still a teenager, awkwardly trying to figure things out.\n\nAnd the pressure! The pressure to find a date, the pressure to have the perfect dress, the pressure to have the perfect night\u2026it's exhausting. It's supposed to be fun, but it feels like a competition.\n\nPlus, everyone's all dressed up and pretending to be someone they're not. It's like a really elaborate costume party. And honestly, I'd rather just hang out with my friends in sweatpants and watch a movie.\n\nIt's just\u2026artificial. It's a manufactured experience. And once you're old enough to see through that, it loses its appeal. It's like realizing Santa Claus isn't real. It's a little bit disappointing.\n\nI mean, if you want to go to prom, go. I'm not gonna judge. But don't feel like you *have* to. It's not the be-all and end-all. There are way more important things in life than a sparkly dress and a slow dance. Like, finding a good pair of boots. Or figuring out what you want to do with your life. Or just being yourself.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026overrated. That's all I'm saying.", "Ugh, okay. Here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. Even though it happened a while ago.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a snap decision. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nI mean, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. I'm barely responsible enough to remember to feed myself, let alone another human being.\n\nAnd my parents\u2026they're great, but they're not equipped to deal with a baby either. They're more into antique furniture and quiet evenings than diaper changes and sleepless nights.\n\nSo, yeah, it wasn't ideal. But it was the best option. For everyone.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life with parents who were ready and willing and able to give it everything it needed. And I knew I couldn't provide that. Not right now. Maybe not ever.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They just\u2026seemed like the perfect parents. And knowing that my baby would be loved and cared for by them made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye\u2026that was brutal. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nPeople kept asking me if I regretted it. And I didn't. I still don't. It was a selfless act, I guess. And it taught me a lot about myself. About responsibility. About love. About letting go.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on the baby. It was about giving the baby the best possible chance at a happy life. And that's something I can live with.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? But I try to focus on the fact that I made the right decision. And that the baby is happy and loved. And that's all that really matters.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack. I don't usually talk about it this much. But you asked. And I figured I owed it to you to be honest.", "Ugh, okay, so my dad. Bless his heart, he means well. He *always* means well. But sometimes, his \"well\" is just\u2026suffocating.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate him being worried, okay? It's just\u2026he's acting like Mark and Vanessa are these villains trying to steal my baby. Like they're gonna snatch it and run off to a remote island and raise it to be a pirate or something.\n\nThey're not. They're nice people. They're\u2026normal. And they want a kid. And I want my kid to have a good life, a better life than I can give it right now.\n\nHe keeps going on about contracts and lawyers and making sure everything is \"legally sound.\" Which, yeah, that's important. But it's also making me feel like I'm selling a car, not giving a baby a home.\n\nIt's my decision, okay? I'm the one who's pregnant. I'm the one who's doing all the hard stuff. And I've thought this through. A lot.\n\nI get that he's scared for me. He's always been protective. But I'm not a little kid anymore. I can handle this. And I need him to trust me.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like he doesn't trust my judgment. Like he thinks I'm gonna make a stupid decision. And that's hurtful.\n\nI love my dad, I really do. But sometimes, he just needs to chill. And let me make my own mistakes. Because, honestly, I'm probably gonna make a lot of them anyway. That's just part of being a teenager. And a mom. And a person trying to figure things out.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. Everything is complicated. But I'm doing what I think is best. And I need him to support me, even if he doesn't fully understand.", "Ugh. Seriously? My dad. Always with the\u2026observations. Like he's some kind of expert on self-awareness.\n\nOkay, so he said I don't know when to say when. Which, like, *ouch*. It stings a little, even though I try to pretend it doesn't. Because it's kinda true. I tend to just\u2026go for things. Even when they're probably a bad idea. Like, getting pregnant. Or agreeing to an open adoption. Or befriending Paul.\n\nBut it's not like I *want* to be reckless. It's just\u2026I get bored easily. And I hate feeling stuck. And sometimes, the only way to feel alive is to take a risk. Even if it's a stupid risk.\n\nAnd honestly, he's not exactly a role model for measured decision-making, okay? He bailed on my mom and me when I was a baby. *He's* the one who doesn't know when to say when!\n\nSo yeah, it bothered me. It always bothers me when he tries to act all wise and judgmental. But I didn't say anything. What was I gonna say? \"You're a hypocrite?\" That would just start a fight.\n\nI just kinda rolled my eyes and changed the subject. It's what I always do. It's easier than dealing with the mess.\n\nBut it's stuck with me, you know? Maybe he's right. Maybe I do need to learn to slow down and think things through. But then again\u2026where's the fun in that?\n\nIt's complicated. Everything always is.", "Ugh, Loring. Don't even get me started on Loring. It's\u2026a lot. It's like, Stepford Wives meets McMansions. Seriously.\n\nIt's just so\u2026*perfect*. And not in a good way. Everything is manicured and pristine and everyone pretends to be happy. It's creepy. It feels like everyone's trying too hard. Like they're all auditioning for a role in a really boring play.\n\nAnd the gates! The *gates*! Like they're trying to keep something out, or keep something in. Probably both. It's just\u2026isolating. It feels like they're trying to create their own little bubble, separate from the rest of the world. Which, honestly, is kinda messed up.\n\nIt's not that I'm against nice houses or anything. It's just\u2026it feels so artificial. So lacking in authenticity. Like, who *are* these people? They all look the same and talk the same and probably think the same. It's terrifying.\n\nAnd the pressure! I can just imagine the pressure to keep up appearances. To have the perfect lawn, the perfect car, the perfect kids. It's exhausting just thinking about it.\n\nI mean, I get it. People want to feel safe and secure. But building a wall around yourself isn't the answer. It just creates more distance and isolation.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather live in a messy, imperfect neighborhood with real people than in a sterile, gated community with Stepford robots. It's just\u2026more real. And I prefer real. Even if it's a little bit chaotic.\n\nSo yeah, Loring? Not my vibe. Not even a little bit. It's just\u2026too much.", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, so, first impressions? She was\u2026intense. Like, *really* put together. Always perfectly accessorized, hair always did, and she just had this\u2026vibe. Like she\u2019d planned out her entire life in a color-coded spreadsheet. Which, honestly, is kinda terrifying.\n\nI mean, she was nice enough, I guess. Polite. But she was also\u2026expectant. Like she was already picturing the perfect baby and the perfect life, and I was just\u2026a vessel. A temporary inconvenience.\n\nShe kept asking me about baby names and nursery themes, and I was just sitting there thinking, \u201cI haven\u2019t even finished my junior year!\u201d It was a lot.\n\nAnd she was *so* into the whole adoption thing being this beautiful, selfless act. Which, it is, I guess. But it\u2019s also complicated. And messy. And I was kinda hoping she\u2019d get that.\n\nI think I was mostly intimidated, honestly. She had her life together, and I\u2026didn\u2019t. I was still figuring things out. And she just seemed so\u2026sure of everything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t like her, exactly. It was just\u2026she was a lot to process. And I was already processing a lot. It took me a while to see past the perfect exterior and realize she was just a person, too. A person who really, really wanted a baby. And that made her kinda vulnerable, actually. But it still took a while to get there.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with Bleeker and the backpack. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It was mortifying. Like, full-body cringe mortifying. Here I am, trying to be all cool and independent and sarcastic, and this guy, who I barely even *talk* to, offers to carry my backpack? It was just\u2026awkward.\n\nIt wasn't even about the weight of the backpack, okay? It was about the *gesture*. It was like he was trying to be a knight in shining armor or something. And I don't *need* a knight in shining armor. I can carry my own stuff, thank you very much.\n\nBut then\u2026he looked so earnest about it. And he was kinda cute, in a dorky, sweet way. And I was already having a really rough time, you know? With the whole baby situation and everything. So I guess I let him do it.\n\nIt wasn't like I *wanted* him to carry it. It was more like\u2026I was too tired to argue. And maybe, just maybe, a tiny part of me appreciated the gesture. But I would *never* admit that out loud.\n\nI definitely played it cool, though. I just mumbled a \"thanks\" and tried to act like it wasn't a big deal. But inside, I was a total mess. It was just\u2026a moment. A weird, awkward, slightly sweet moment. And it definitely made me think about Bleeker in a different way.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. Seriously. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about \"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? It's...complicated. It's not like it magically made me stop noticing my thighs or anything. That would be a miracle.\n\nBut it was the first time I saw a girl who looked like *me* being, like, desirable. And not in a creepy, magazine-cover way. Yuki was\u2026real. She wasn't all skinny and perfect. She was curvy and kinda awkward, and she was still the object of affection.\n\nI know it's a comic book, and it's kinda weird, but it made me realize that maybe being different wasn't a bad thing. Maybe being a \"fat dork,\" as you so eloquently put it, wasn't the end of the world.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to *be* Yuki. It was about seeing someone who looked like me being seen as\u2026worthy. Like, someone actually found her attractive. And that was a big deal.\n\nI'd spent so much time trying to blend in, trying to be invisible, trying to not take up too much space. And then here was this comic book that was saying, \"Hey, it's okay to be you.\"\n\nIt didn't solve all my problems, obviously. I still had a lot of figuring out to do. But it was a little spark of hope. A little reminder that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't so terrible after all.\n\nIt was a weird, Japanese comic book, and it kinda saved my life. Or at least, it saved my self-esteem for a little while. And honestly, sometimes that's enough.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about that whole superhero thing with Mark? Honestly, it was\u2026weird. And kinda flattering, I guess. But mostly weird.\n\nHe said it was because she was, like, \"carrying the weight of the world\" or something. Dramatic, right? Like I'm saving the planet or something. I'm just carrying a baby. It's not the same.\n\nBut I think\u2026I think he meant it because she was strong. Not physically, obviously. But strong in a different way. She was doing something hard, something unexpected, and she was doing it on her own terms. \n\nAnd I guess that's me, too. I'm not exactly a typical teenager. I'm pregnant, I'm giving the baby up for adoption, I'm trying to figure out my life\u2026it's not easy. But I'm doing it. I'm making my own choices.\n\nHe probably also thought it was funny, because I'm kinda sarcastic and cynical. And superheroes are usually all earnest and noble. It's a contrast, you know?\n\nBut honestly, I don't really see myself as a superhero. I'm just a girl who made a mistake. And I'm trying to do the best I can with it. \n\nMark's a sweet guy, though. He just has a way of looking at things\u2026differently. And sometimes, his weirdness is kinda nice. It makes me feel\u2026seen, I guess. Even if I don't always understand what he's talking about.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Being compared to a superhero. I'd rather just be Juno. A regular, slightly sarcastic, pregnant Juno.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. And kinda raw, if I'm being honest. Everyone's been throwing opinions at me about open adoption versus closed adoption, and it's exhausting. Like, people think they know what's best for *my* baby, when they haven't lived through any of this.\n\nLook, I get the appeal of open adoption. It sounds\u2026nice. Like, the birth parents get to see the kid grow up, and the kid knows where they came from. It's all very warm and fuzzy. And for some people, that's totally the right choice.\n\nBut for me? It's just\u2026too much. Too much emotional baggage. Too much potential for drama. I'm already dealing with a lot, okay? I'm a teenager. I'm giving up my baby, which is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I don't need to be constantly reminded of it.\n\nI need to be able to move on with my life. I need to be able to heal. And I don't think I can do that if I'm getting regular updates and pictures and visits. It's not that I don't care about the baby, it's that I need to protect myself.\n\nA closed adoption feels\u2026cleaner. It allows me to grieve in private. It allows the adoptive parents to build a family without me hovering around. It allows the baby to grow up without feeling like they're being pulled in two different directions.\n\nIt's not about being selfish. It's about doing what's best for everyone involved. And for me, that means a closed adoption. It's the only way I can feel okay with this.\n\nI know some people think it's old-fashioned or controlling. But it's my decision. And I need to be able to make it without feeling guilty or judged. It's my body, my baby, and my life. And I need to do what's right for me, even if it's not what everyone else thinks is right.\n\nIt's just\u2026I need space. I need time. And I need to be able to move on without constantly reliving this. Is that so much to ask?", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. It's not my favorite thing, but I guess it's a fair question.\n\nHonestly, before all the baby stuff happened, I was just kinda\u2026drifting. I was good at being sarcastic and avoiding feelings, but I didn't really *know* who I was. I was just\u2026Juno. The girl who liked records and made snarky comments. I hadn't really thought about what I wanted out of life, you know?\n\nBut getting pregnant\u2026that forced me to grow up, whether I wanted to or not. It wasn't about the baby, not entirely. It was about taking responsibility for my actions and making a really big decision. And it wasn't an easy decision. Giving the baby up to Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut through that whole process, I realized I was stronger than I thought. I could handle tough situations. I could be honest with myself and with others. I could make choices that weren't necessarily what *I* wanted, but what was best for everyone involved.\n\nAnd meeting Paul\u2026that was a big part of it too. He wasn't what I expected, but he saw me for who I was, flaws and all. He didn't try to change me, he just\u2026accepted me. And that helped me accept myself.\n\nI think my journey wasn't about finding a pre-defined \"identity.\" It was about *creating* one. It was about figuring out what I believed in, what I valued, and what kind of person I wanted to be. \n\nI'm still figuring it out, obviously. I'm still just a teenager. But I'm not the same teenager I was at the beginning of the movie. I'm more confident, more resilient, and more aware of my own strength. \n\nI learned that it's okay to be vulnerable, it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers. And that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the ones that lead to the greatest growth.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it helped me find strength. It wasn't a magical transformation, it was just\u2026life. Messy, complicated, and ultimately, pretty amazing.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with the prom stuff. It's\u2026complicated. And kinda embarrassing. But fine, you asked.\n\nIt was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.\n\nYeah, I know. Super clich\u00e9. Super sappy. But it was Mark's pick. He was all, \"It's about finding someone who makes every day feel new,\" and I was all, \"Okay, whatever, just pick a song so we can get this over with.\"\n\nBut honestly? It kinda fit. Even though I was pretending to be totally over him and just going to prom as a friend. It was a weird night. A lot of awkward slow dancing and trying not to make eye contact. \n\nAnd it's not like it was some grand romantic moment, okay? It was just\u2026a dance. A slightly uncomfortable, slightly sweet dance. But it's a song I'll always associate with him. And with that whole messy, confusing time in my life.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be all cynical and independent, not a hopeless romantic.\n\nSeriously, though. Bright Eyes. Don't judge. It was Mark's choice. And he had good taste in music, even if he was a total dork sometimes.", "Ugh, okay, this is still\u2026a thing people ask me about. Like, it wasn't a simple decision, alright? It wasn't like I was picking a favorite flavor of ice cream.\n\nLook, Mark was a good guy. Really. Sweet, kinda clueless, but good. And I could tell he was falling for me, which was\u2026complicated. But Vanessa? Vanessa was *solid*. She had her life together. She was stable. She was ready to be a mom. Mark was\u2026not. Not yet, anyway.\n\nIt wasn't about punishing Mark or anything. It was about what was best for the baby. That kid deserved parents who were both emotionally and financially prepared. And Vanessa was that. Mark wasn't. He was still figuring things out. He was still a kid himself, honestly.\n\nIf Mark had left Vanessa, it would have been a disaster. For everyone. Vanessa would have been heartbroken, Mark would have been lost, and the baby\u2026well, the baby would have been caught in the middle of all that mess.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a loving, stable home. And Vanessa offered that. Mark, at that point, didn't. It wasn't about me and Mark, it was about the baby.\n\nAnd honestly, I knew Mark and Vanessa were good together. They just needed a little\u2026push. A little incentive to actually *commit* to each other. And the baby was that incentive.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy. It was awkward. But it was the right thing to do. And in the end, everyone ended up happier. Even me. Eventually.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes you have to make tough choices. And sometimes, the right choice isn't the easiest one. It just is. And I had to live with that.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with Mark. Seriously. That guy.\n\nIt\u2026sucked. A lot. Like, a whole lot. It wasn't even the \"not ready to be a father\" part, exactly. It was the way he said it. All casual, like he was ordering a pizza. \"Oh, yeah, I'm not really feeling the whole dad thing right now.\" *Really?* That's all you got?\n\nI mean, I knew he wasn't exactly father material. He was, like, permanently stuck in arrested development. But I thought\u2026I don't know. Maybe he'd step up. Maybe he'd at least *try*.\n\nBut no. He just wanted to go to college and play music and be a carefree dude. Which, okay, fine. But that didn't mean he got to just\u2026check out.\n\nIt felt like he didn't even care. Like this whole thing \u2013 *my* whole thing \u2013 was just an inconvenience to him. And that stung. A lot.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to be all sarcastic and detached, like I didn't care. But inside? I was a mess. I was scared and confused and really, really angry.\n\nIt made me realize that I was doing this mostly on my own. And that was\u2026terrifying. But also, kind of empowering. I mean, if he wasn't going to be there, I was going to have to be strong enough for both of us.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. It was a really hard moment. But it also made me realize that I could handle anything. Even a clueless boyfriend and an unplanned pregnancy. I just had to figure it out. And I did. Eventually.\n\n\n\nDon't even get me started on Paulie Bleeker. He was way more supportive. Just saying.", "Ugh, okay, so Mark. Yeah. That was\u2026something. People always ask about him, like he's some fascinating specimen. Which, honestly, he kinda was.\n\nIt wasn't like I *planned* to be friends with a guy who collected vintage records and built guitars in his basement. I mean, he was kinda dorky. And quiet. And definitely not the type of guy I usually hung out with.\n\nBut that was kinda the point, I guess. Everyone else at school was so\u2026predictable. All about popularity and football and whatever. Mark was just\u2026different. He didn't care about any of that stuff. He was just into his own thing. And I respected that.\n\nHe didn't try to impress me or anything. He just\u2026was. He was honest and genuine and kinda awkward, and I found that really refreshing. He didn't judge me for being, well, me. For being sarcastic and opinionated and a little bit of a mess.\n\nAnd he listened. Like, *really* listened. He didn't interrupt or try to fix things. He just let me talk. And that was a big deal, especially when I was dealing with\u2026everything.\n\nHis life *was* weird, yeah. But it was a good kind of weird. It was creative and interesting and full of music. And it was a nice escape from all the drama at school and at home.\n\nHe made me laugh, too. He had this dry sense of humor that I really appreciated. And he wasn't afraid to be silly.\n\nSo, yeah, I liked being a part of his weird life. Because it was real. And it was a safe space. And it was a reminder that it's okay to be different. And honestly, I think he needed a friend who could handle his weirdness, and I needed someone who didn't expect me to be anything other than myself. It just\u2026worked.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't a romantic thing, or anything. It was just a good friendship. And sometimes, that's the best kind of relationship there is.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, trying to get inside his head is\u2026a challenge. He's kinda a gentle giant, you know? A big softie underneath all the guitar playing and quiet brooding.\n\nI think, honestly, he's terrified. Like, genuinely scared out of his mind. He's barely an adult himself, and now he's supposed to be a *dad*? It's a lot to process.\n\nHe's probably replaying every bad decision he's ever made, wondering if he's capable of being a good father. He's definitely worried about screwing things up. He's not the type to just jump into things without thinking them through, you know? He overthinks *everything*.\n\nBut underneath the fear, I think he's also\u2026excited. Like, a quiet, hesitant excitement. He's always been good with kids, even if he doesn't really show it. He's patient and kind, and he actually *listens* when kids talk to him.\n\nHe's probably picturing teaching the baby to play guitar, or reading it stories, or just being there for it. He wants to be a good dad, he really does. He just doesn't know how.\n\nI think he's also worried about losing me. Not in a romantic way, necessarily, but just\u2026our friendship. He's probably afraid that becoming a father will change everything, and that we won't be as close anymore.\n\nHe's a good guy, Mark. He's just\u2026complicated. And he needs a lot of reassurance. And maybe a really good guitar solo to work through his feelings.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I think he's mostly just hoping he doesn't completely mess it up. Which, you know, is a pretty normal feeling for a soon-to-be dad.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment. Don't judge me.\n\nLook, everything was just\u2026a lot. I'd just found out I was pregnant. My life was completely upside down. I was trying to act normal, trying to pretend like everything was fine, but inside I was a total mess.\n\nAnd then I was at Loring's, and everything smelled so\u2026fancy. Like, grown-up. And I just wanted to feel\u2026something. Something other than terrified and confused.\n\nIt wasn't about the perfume itself, okay? It was about wanting something that wasn't mine. It was about wanting to feel like I had some control over my life, even if it was just a tiny little thing like stealing a bottle of expensive perfume.\n\nIt was stupid. I know it was stupid. And I felt really bad about it afterwards. But in that moment, it just felt\u2026necessary. Like I needed to do something rebellious, something impulsive.\n\nIt was a cry for help, I guess. A really dumb, misguided cry for help.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a really nice perfume. But that's not the point. The point is, I was a mess, and I made a bad decision. And I learned from it. Mostly. Don't steal things, people. It's not worth it.", "Ugh, okay, so you want my take on the Mark and Vanessa situation? Honestly? It's kinda sad. And kinda obvious, if you actually *look* at them.\n\nI think Mark wants a divorce because he's\u2026bored. And maybe a little scared. Vanessa is, like, *perfect*. Perfect house, perfect garden, perfect kids, perfect everything. And Mark? He's just\u2026Mark. He likes classic cars and playing guitar and being kinda goofy. He doesn't fit into her perfect little world.\n\nShe wants everything to be just so, you know? Everything has to be planned and organized and *right*. And he just wants to chill. He wants to be himself. And I think he feels like he can't be himself around her anymore.\n\nIt's not that he doesn't love her, I don't think. It's just that they've grown apart. They want different things. And he's realized that he needs to be happy, even if it means hurting her.\n\nAnd honestly, I think he's been wanting out for a while. He just didn't have the guts to say anything. Until now.\n\nIt's a messy situation, and it's gonna be hard on everyone. But sometimes, people just aren't meant to be together forever. And it's better to be honest about that, even if it's painful.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. You can force it, but it's never gonna be a good fit. And eventually, something's gotta give.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026sad. But also, kinda understandable. People change. And sometimes, they grow in different directions.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the awkward stuff, huh? Fine. Look, it wasn't like I was trying to be rude or anything. It's just\u2026complicated.\n\nVanessa is nice, okay? Really nice. And she's a good friend to Paul. But she's also\u2026really perceptive. And she was looking at me with *that* look. You know, the one that says, \"I know something is up, and I'm gonna get you to talk about it.\"\n\nAnd I wasn't ready to talk about it. Not with anyone. Especially not with Vanessa. It was all still so new and messy and scary. I hadn't even fully processed it myself yet.\n\nI mean, I was pregnant! With Paul's baby! And we were, like, barely even dating! It was a disaster waiting to happen. And Vanessa, being the super-together, super-organized person she is, would have immediately started making plans and offering solutions. And I just\u2026wasn't ready for that.\n\nI needed space. I needed time to think. I needed to escape before I started crying or saying something stupid.\n\nSo yeah, I bolted. It was a terrible way to handle it, I know. But I was panicking. I just needed to get out of there and breathe. And maybe eat a bag of chips. It was a bad moment, okay? Don't judge me too harshly. I was a mess.\n\n\n\nIt's not like I was trying to hide it forever. I just needed a minute to collect myself before facing the music. And honestly, I was probably just being a typical teenager. Dramatic and irrational. It's what we do.", "Ugh, Vanessa. She's\u2026optimistic. To a fault. Like, aggressively optimistic. It's kinda exhausting just being *around* it sometimes.\n\nLook, I get it. She loves Mark. And she wants him to be a dad. She *needs* him to be a dad. But honestly? I think she's setting herself up for disappointment.\n\nMark is\u2026Mark. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong. But he's also kinda immature and self-absorbed. He's still figuring out his own life, and adding a baby into the mix right now would be a disaster. For everyone.\n\nVanessa keeps saying he just needs time to \"grow into it.\" But some people don't *grow* into things, you know? Some people just\u2026stay the same. And Mark feels like one of those people.\n\nI think she's clinging to this idea of a perfect family, and she's ignoring the reality of the situation. She's so focused on what she *wants* to happen that she's not seeing what's actually happening.\n\nIt's not fair to the baby, either. A baby deserves parents who are fully committed and ready to be there for them. Not parents who are hoping to \"come around\" eventually.\n\nI feel bad for her, honestly. She's a good person, and she deserves to be happy. But I don't think Mark is the one who's going to make that happen. She needs to face facts and move on. It's gonna hurt, but it's better to be honest with herself than to keep living in a fantasy.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating. Sometimes people are just too blind to see what's right in front of them. And I'm not sure what you can say to them to make them see it.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's kinda embarrassing to admit, but...I'm a sucker for indie folk.\n\nYeah, I know. It's super clich\u00e9. Like, the soundtrack to every coming-of-age movie ever. But hear me out.\n\nIt's not the *happy* stuff, okay? It's the sad, kinda quirky, honest stuff. Like The Moldy Peaches, obviously. They're the best. But also, Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens...you know, the bands that make you feel all the feelings.\n\nI guess it's because life is messy and complicated, and those songs just *get* it. They don't try to sugarcoat anything. They're real. And sometimes, you just need to listen to something that understands how you're feeling, even if it's a little bit depressing.\n\nPlus, a lot of it is just acoustic guitar and simple lyrics. It's not overproduced or flashy. It's just...raw. And I appreciate that.\n\nI'm not saying I listen to it all the time. Sometimes I need something upbeat and danceable. But when I'm feeling introspective, or just kinda bummed out, indie folk is my go-to.\n\nIt's like a musical hug. A slightly melancholic, but ultimately comforting hug. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.\n\n\n\nSeriously though, The Moldy Peaches. Check them out. You won't regret it. Unless you hate honesty and vulnerability. Then you probably will regret it.", "Ugh, pilates. Okay, look. I'm not against people who like it. Seriously. If you get a thrill out of meticulously controlling your core and pretending you're a graceful swan, you do you. But it's just...not my thing.\n\nIt feels too\u2026intentional. Too *try-hard*. Like, I get enough pressure trying to figure out my life, I don't need to add pressure to perfectly align my spine.\n\nAnd exercising in general? It's a necessary evil, I guess. I mean, I know I *should* do it. Especially now. Being pregnant kinda changes things. You gotta, like, prepare your body for the whole human-making process.\n\nBut I'm not one of those people who genuinely *enjoys* running or going to the gym. It feels like a chore. I'd rather be reading a comic book or listening to The Moldy Peaches.\n\nI did try yoga once. It was\u2026weird. A lot of deep breathing and chanting. And I kept accidentally farting. It was not a good experience.\n\nI think the best exercise for me is just\u2026walking. Or maybe dancing around my room when no one's looking. Something low-key and not too strenuous. \n\nHonestly, I'm more focused on keeping my brain healthy than my body right now. But I'm trying to be responsible. For the baby, you know? It deserves a mom who can at least walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded.\n\nSo yeah, pilates? No thanks. Exercise? Fine, I'll do it. But don't expect me to be enthusiastic about it. I'm a teenager with a lot on my mind. I have more important things to worry about than my abs.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so the guitar thing\u2026that was\u2026complicated. It wasn\u2019t like some grand romantic gesture, you know? It was more\u2026awkwardly sweet. And revealing.\n\nSee, I\u2019m not exactly an open book. I use sarcasm as a shield, and I definitely don\u2019t let people see me being vulnerable. But when I started playing guitar for him, and then *writing* songs\u2026it was different. It was like, I was letting him see a part of me that nobody else got to see. The real me, I guess. The one that\u2019s kinda messy and insecure and full of feelings.\n\nIt was terrifying, honestly. Because what if he hated it? What if he thought it was stupid? What if he realized I was just a big, awkward mess?\n\nBut he didn\u2019t. He actually *liked* it. He listened, and he didn\u2019t judge. He even encouraged me to keep writing. And that\u2026that meant a lot.\n\nIt made our connection deeper, I think. It wasn\u2019t just about flirting and making out anymore. It was about sharing something real. Something personal. It showed me he was willing to look past the snark and see who I really was.\n\nBut it also made things\u2026more intense. Because when you share something that vulnerable, it\u2019s hard to go back. It raised the stakes. It made me realize I was starting to actually *care* about him, which was scary. Because I didn\u2019t want to get hurt.\n\nAnd then, of course, there was the whole \u201che\u2019s going to college and I\u2019m staying here\u201d thing hanging over everything. So the guitar playing was kinda like a way of holding onto something, of making a connection that felt\u2026lasting. Even if it wasn\u2019t going to be.\n\nIt was a good thing, though. Even if it was also kinda painful. It showed me that even when things are messy and complicated, there\u2019s still room for beauty and connection. And it showed me that Mark wasn\u2019t just some cute boy. He was someone who actually *saw* me. And that\u2019s pretty rare.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about music? It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, seriously. It's the only thing that keeps me from completely losing it sometimes.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, everything just felt\u2026weird. Like, my life was suddenly a movie I didn't audition for. And I didn't have a soundtrack for it. So I had to *make* one.\n\nMusic is just\u2026a way to feel things without having to actually *say* things. You know? It's like, when I'm feeling super overwhelmed, I put on The Moldy Peaches and it's just\u2026comforting. It's weird and quirky and honest, and it makes me feel less alone.\n\nAnd when I'm feeling angry, I listen to stuff that's loud and aggressive. Like, Bikini Kill or something. It's a good way to get my frustration out without, like, yelling at everyone. Which I'm trying to avoid.\n\nAnd when I'm feeling sad, I listen to\u2026well, I listen to a lot of sad songs. It's kinda cathartic, you know? It lets me feel my feelings without having to pretend everything's okay.\n\nPaul makes me mix CDs. He knows I'm not a big \"talk about my feelings\" kind of person, so he just makes me playlists. It's kinda sweet, actually.\n\nIt's not just about the lyrics, either. It's about the *sound*. The rhythm. The melody. It's like, music can just\u2026transport you. It can take you out of your head and into a different place.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing is scary and confusing and overwhelming. But music helps me make sense of it. It helps me process my emotions. It helps me feel\u2026human.\n\nIt's my escape. It's my comfort. It's my soundtrack to a life I didn't expect, but I'm trying to figure out. And honestly, I don't know what I'd do without it. It's just\u2026important. Okay? Really important.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026a mess. A really big mess. And honestly, it still stings to think about.\n\nIt wasn't about *them*, not really. It was about me. I was freaking out. Everything was just\u2026too much. Vanessa and Mark were fighting, and it was awful, and I felt like I was stuck in the middle of a tornado.\n\nI mean, they were both being kinda awful, you know? Vanessa was all passive-aggressive and Mark was just\u2026Mark. And I was just\u2026pregnant. And confused. And scared.\n\nI felt like if I stayed there, I was going to explode. Like, I was going to say something I'd regret, or do something stupid. I just needed to *escape*. To get away from the drama and the yelling and the\u2026everything.\n\nIt was a really selfish thing to do, I know that. I just\u2026panicked. I didn't think about how it would look, or how it would make them feel. I just needed to breathe.\n\nI ended up at the arcade, playing Dance Dance Revolution. It was the only thing that made me feel remotely okay at the time. It was just\u2026distracting.\n\nI felt terrible afterwards, of course. I knew I'd hurt them. But I just couldn't handle it anymore. I was a mess, okay? A hormonal, emotionally unstable mess.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, and I regret it. But it was also\u2026understandable. I was a kid, dealing with a really complicated situation. And sometimes, kids just run away. It doesn't make it right, but it makes it\u2026human.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of, but it's part of my story. And it taught me a lot about myself, and about the importance of communication. And about the fact that sometimes, you just need to take a deep breath and walk away. Even if it's the wrong thing to do.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026not a good moment.\n\nIt wasn't just the fight with Mark, okay? It was everything. It was realizing that things weren't going to be simple, that life wasn't a movie, and that even good people make really messed up decisions. It was feeling completely alone and responsible for something huge, and realizing I didn't have all the answers.\n\nI think\u2026I think I was just overwhelmed. Like, a tidal wave of emotions all crashing down at once. Sadness, anger, fear, confusion\u2026it was a lot to handle. And I was trying to be strong, you know? Trying to be cool and sarcastic and pretend like everything was fine. But it wasn't fine.\n\nAnd then Mark said\u2026what he said. And it just broke something inside me. It wasn't about him not wanting the baby, it was about him not being able to see *me*. Not seeing how much this meant to me, how much I was already feeling.\n\nSo yeah, I cried. A lot. Like, ugly crying. Snot bubbles and everything. It was embarrassing, and I was mad at myself for being so emotional. But I couldn't stop. It just\u2026had to come out.\n\nIt felt like my whole world was falling apart. Like everything I thought I knew was wrong. And I was just\u2026lost.\n\nIt was a really awful feeling. And honestly, I don't think I'll ever forget it. It was a turning point, I guess. It made me realize that I had to figure things out for myself, and that I couldn't rely on anyone else to fix my problems.\n\nIt sucked. Plain and simple. It just really, really sucked.\n\n\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's okay to be vulnerable sometimes. Even if you're trying to be a tough girl.", "Ugh, okay, you want to talk about the Jiffy Lube receipt? Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. A very specific moment of teenage angst and trying to figure things out.\n\nSo, Paul, he was\u2026complicated. And I was trying to figure out what I wanted, what I felt. And he kept asking me what I was thinking, what I was feeling. And I just\u2026couldn\u2019t articulate it. It was all a mess inside my head.\n\nSo, when we were at Jiffy Lube \u2013 don\u2019t ask, it\u2019s a long story involving Mark and a car \u2013 I just grabbed a pen and wrote on the receipt: **\u201cLife is pretty serious business.\u201d**\n\nIt sounds so dramatic, I know. But at the time, it felt\u2026profound. It was like, everything was suddenly real. The pregnancy, the adoption, Paul, Mark, everything. It wasn\u2019t just a movie anymore. It was my life. And it was a big responsibility.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to tell Paul how I felt directly. I was too scared. So I wrote it on the receipt, hoping he\u2019d get the message. Hoping he\u2019d understand that I was trying to be brave, even though I was terrified.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, honestly. But it was *my* stupid thing to do. And it was a way for me to express myself when I couldn\u2019t find the words.\n\nHe did get it, eventually. Or at least, he said he did. And that\u2019s all that mattered, I guess. It was a small moment, but it was a turning point. It was the beginning of me figuring out who I was and what I wanted. And it all started with a Jiffy Lube receipt. Go figure.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Honestly? A lot of things. Mostly just a giant, swirling mess of \"Oh. My. God. This is going horribly wrong.\"\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026intense. But I didn't realize it was *that* intense. I thought she was just, you know, a little bit quirky and maybe a little bit lonely. I didn't think she was gonna completely fall apart over a piece of paper.\n\nWhen she started crying, I just wanted to disappear. Like, vanish into thin air. It was awful. I felt so bad for her, but also\u2026really awkward. I mean, I was just standing there, holding a note, while this woman was having a full-blown emotional breakdown.\n\nI was also thinking, \"Okay, this is officially the worst adoption interview ever.\" I was worried that it was gonna ruin everything. That Mark and Vanessa were gonna decide I was too unstable to be a mother, and they'd find someone else.\n\nAnd then I felt guilty. Guilty for feeling that way. Because it wasn't about me. It was about Vanessa and her feelings. And she was clearly hurting.\n\nI just wanted to say something, anything, to make it better. But I didn't know what to say. I'm not good at emotional stuff. I usually just make sarcastic jokes to deflect. But that didn't seem appropriate in that situation.\n\nSo I just stood there, feeling helpless and awkward and really, really sorry for Vanessa. It was a really uncomfortable moment. And honestly, it made me question everything. Like, was I doing the right thing? Was I making a mistake?\n\nIt was a lot to process. And it definitely made me realize that this whole adoption thing was gonna be a lot more complicated than I thought.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with Vanessa. She's\u2026intense. And she has a way of making you feel like you're being dissected under a microscope.\n\nWhen she asked me that, if I'm being honest, it felt like someone punched me in the gut. Like, a really good punch. It wasn't the question itself, it was *how* she asked it. All judgy and concerned and like she already knew the answer and didn't approve.\n\nIt was right after I'd been trying to convince myself, and everyone else, that I was totally cool with it. That I was being mature and selfless and all that jazz. And then Vanessa just\u2026cuts through all the BS and asks me point-blank if I was *really* going through with it.\n\nIt made me realize I hadn't actually admitted it to myself yet. I'd been so busy focusing on the practical stuff \u2013 finding the right couple, dealing with Mark and Vanessa, trying to finish school \u2013 that I hadn't stopped to think about what it actually *meant*.\n\nI think I just kinda mumbled something about it being the right thing to do. Which it was, I knew that. But it didn't feel like enough. It felt\u2026empty.\n\nIt was one of those moments where all the bravado just kinda melted away and I felt really small and scared and confused. Like, what was I doing? Was I making the right decision? Was I strong enough to go through with it?\n\nI think that's why I snapped at her a little bit. It wasn't about her, it was about me. I was just trying to protect myself from feeling all those scary things.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. And it made me realize that even though I was trying to be strong, I was still just a kid. And I was still really, really scared.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *remind* me. That whole situation was\u2026a mess. Vijay. Seriously. That guy.\n\nIt was awful. Just\u2026awful. I mean, I was already a walking disaster, trying to figure out my life and this whole baby thing, and then *that* happens. It felt like someone just punched me in the gut.\n\nI was so mad. Mad at Vijay for being a total jerk, mad at Bleeker for not saying anything, and mad at myself for just standing there, trying to look cool and collected when I was totally freaking out inside.\n\nIt wasn't just about Bleeker potentially being the dad, it was about the disrespect. Like, my body, my life, my decision\u2026it was all just a joke to him. He didn't even care about how that would make me feel.\n\nAnd Bleeker just\u2026let him say it. He didn't defend me. He just stood there looking all awkward and mumbly. Which, you know, is Bleeker. But still. It was frustrating.\n\nI think I just wanted to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out. It was a really vulnerable moment, and he just completely ruined it.\n\nI ended up just walking away. I didn't have the energy to deal with it. I needed to protect myself, you know? And I needed to figure out what I wanted, without anyone else trying to tell me what to do.\n\nIt was a really crappy night. And it definitely made me question things. But it also made me realize that I needed to stand up for myself. And that I deserved better than that.\n\n\n\nHonestly, just thinking about it makes me want to punch something. Vijay is the worst.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Vijay and the mustache. Seriously. It was\u2026a moment. A deeply weird moment.\n\nLike, first of all, Vijay is a sweet guy, don't get me wrong. But he's also kinda clueless sometimes. And the whole \"real man\" thing? Please. As if growing facial hair suddenly unlocks some secret level of masculinity. It's ridiculous.\n\nMy initial reaction was mostly just\u2026confusion. I think I blinked a lot. And then I probably said something sarcastic, like, \"Oh, so now you're Clint Eastwood?\" Or maybe, \"Does the mustache come with a leather jacket and a brooding silence?\" I can't remember exactly. I say a lot of sarcastic things. It's a reflex.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I was actually kinda touched. He was trying, you know? He was trying to figure out how to be a good dad, and he was doing it in the only way he knew how \u2013 by trying to be\u2026manly. It was misguided, but it was sweet.\n\nI think I ended up telling him that being a \"real man\" isn't about facial hair or tough talk. It's about being responsible, and loving, and being there for your kid. And that he was already doing a pretty good job of that, mustache or no mustache.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing was just\u2026Vijay being Vijay. And I love him for it. Even when he's being completely ridiculous. It just made me realize how much he cared, and how much he was trying. And that's what really mattered.\n\nPlus, the mustache was kinda patchy. Let's be real. It wasn't exactly intimidating. It was more\u2026endearing. In a weird way.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the note. Seriously? That was\u2026a whole thing.\n\nIt wasn't *for* Vanessa, exactly. It was for Paul. It was a list of things I needed him to do while I was at the hospital getting the ultrasound. You know, the really awkward ultrasound where we found out I was having a baby.\n\nIt was mostly practical stuff. Like, \"Take out the trash,\" and \"Don't eat all the peanut butter,\" and \"Try not to freak out.\" But there was also a little bit of\u2026emotional stuff. Like, \"Remember I'm scared,\" and \"Be nice to me.\"\n\nI left it on the kitchen counter because I figured he'd see it. He's not exactly the most observant guy, so I had to make it pretty obvious.\n\nVanessa found it because she was snooping. Which, honestly, I didn't appreciate. But she was worried about me, and she was trying to understand what was going on. So I guess I can't blame her too much.\n\nIt was a really vulnerable moment, you know? I was scared and confused and overwhelmed, and I was trying to figure out how to deal with everything. And that note was a way for me to communicate my feelings to Paul, even when I couldn't actually talk about them.\n\nIt's just\u2026a really personal thing. And I don't really like talking about it. It was a messy time.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I wish Vanessa hadn't found it. It would have been nice to have that little bit of privacy. But, you know, life isn't always fair.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about the whole staying-together thing? Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like I was scared of commitment or anything. It was more\u2026realistic.\n\nSee, my parents, they weren't exactly a shining example of marital bliss. My dad just\u2026left. Vanished. And my mom, she was okay, but she was kinda lost without him. And I saw how hard it was for her, you know? How lonely.\n\nSo, I was worried about Paul and Vanessa. They seemed so\u2026perfect. Like, a movie couple. And I was afraid that once the baby came, things would change. That they'd realize they weren't actually compatible, and they'd end up like my parents.\n\nI didn't want the baby to grow up in a broken home. I didn't want it to feel unwanted or abandoned. I wanted it to have a stable, loving family.\n\nAnd I was also worried about *them*. I didn't want them to make a mistake and stay together for the wrong reasons. I wanted them to be happy, not just\u2026stuck.\n\nIt was a lot to think about, okay? I was just a teenager, trying to figure out my own life, and suddenly I was responsible for the future of a baby and the happiness of two adults. It was kinda overwhelming.\n\nI guess I just wanted everyone to be okay. And I was afraid that staying together would actually make things worse. It's complicated. Life is complicated.", "Ugh, okay, that's a\u2026loaded question. It's not like I'm *searching* for people to love me, okay? I'm perfectly capable of being fiercely independent. But\u2026yeah, there are a few people.\n\nFirst, obviously, my dad, Mac. He's\u2026a lot. He's obsessed with records and doesn't really understand feelings. But he always tries. And he always makes me breakfast. And he lets me decorate my room however I want, even if it's covered in band posters. He loves me, even when I'm being a total pain.\n\nThen there's Leah. She's my best friend. She's the only one who really *gets* me. She doesn't judge me for anything. She just\u2026listens. And she always knows how to make me laugh, even when I'm feeling completely overwhelmed. She's the real deal.\n\nAnd then\u2026there's Paul. Okay, don't get me wrong, it was complicated. And he's kinda dorky. But he actually *listened* to me. He didn't try to change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026accepted me. For all my weirdness and sarcasm and awkwardness. He loved me for exactly who I was, even when I didn't love myself.\n\nSo yeah, those are the people. My dad, Leah, and Paul. They're the ones who see me for who I really am, and they love me anyway. And honestly, that's all I really need.\n\nIt's not about having a ton of friends or being popular. It's about having a few people who truly care about you, and who will be there for you no matter what. And I'm lucky enough to have that. Even if I don't always admit it.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about the ultrasound. It's not like I'm getting a puppy, you know? It's a *person*. A tiny person growing inside me. It's kinda weird to think about.\n\nAnyway, after the ultrasound\u2026the plan is still the same. I'm giving the baby up for adoption. I've thought about it a lot, and I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nI've met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are going to adopt him (or her!). They're really nice. They seem like they're going to be amazing parents. They want a baby so badly, and they can give it a life that I just\u2026can't.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, it's scary. It's gonna be really hard to give up the baby. But I know it's the best thing for everyone involved. The baby deserves a stable home and loving parents who are ready for it. And I need to finish high school and figure out my own life.\n\nThe ultrasound is just\u2026confirmation. It's making it real. It's making it official. And then I just have to\u2026get through the next few months.\n\nI'm trying not to think about it too much. I'm just taking it one day at a time. And trying to focus on school and my friends and everything else that's going on in my life.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple situation. But I'm doing the best I can. And I'm hoping that everything will work out for the best.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. And I'm kinda tired of talking about it, honestly. Can we talk about something else? Like, music or movies or something?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It still stings, honestly. People have *opinions*, don't they? Everyone thinks they know what's best for you, especially when it comes to something as big as this.\n\nAt first, it was the worst. People giving me the side-eye at school, whispering. My dad's coworker asking him if I was \"keeping it.\" Like it was some kind of souvenir. It made me want to just disappear.\n\nBut then I realized\u2026it's *my* life. *My* decision. And it's not about what other people think. It's about what's best for the baby. And what's best for me.\n\nI'm not ready to be a mom right now. I have my own stuff going on. I want to finish school, go to college, figure out who I am. And I want this baby to have a loving, stable home with parents who are prepared and excited to raise a child.\n\nI know some people think giving a baby up for adoption is selfish. But I don't see it that way. I see it as a selfless act. I'm choosing to give this baby the best possible life, even if it means I don't get to be a part of it.\n\nIt's hard, okay? It's really hard. But I'm doing what I think is right. And I'm not going to let other people's judgment make me feel bad about it.\n\nI mean, people are always judging something. It's just what they do. You gotta learn to tune it out. Or at least, pretend to. And surround yourself with people who support you, no matter what. That's what I'm trying to do.\n\nSo, do I like being judged? No. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to trust my own instincts. And that's all that really matters.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026hard to talk about. It's not like I think they're *bad* people, okay? Mark and Vanessa seem really nice. Like, super nice. Maybe *too* nice? It's weird.\n\nBut it's my baby, you know? Even if I'm not keeping it. And it's hard to just hand over someone you've been growing inside you to\u2026anyone. Even really nice people.\n\nMy biggest thing is\u2026they're kinda perfect. Like, they have a beautiful house, a stable job, a golden retriever. It's all very\u2026Stepford Wives. And I worry that they'll put too much pressure on the kid to be perfect too. Like, straight A's, soccer star, future doctor. I don't want my baby to feel like it has to live up to some impossible standard.\n\nAnd they're older. Which isn't a bad thing, but\u2026they've already lived their lives, you know? They've already had their adventures. I worry that they'll expect the baby to be, like, a little companion instead of a whole person with their own dreams and stuff.\n\nI also worry about them telling the baby about me. Like, how much do I want to be involved? Do I want to be \"Aunt Juno\"? Or do I just want to let them have a normal life without me constantly hovering around? It's complicated.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm just scared that they won't love the baby as much as I do. Which is stupid, I know. They seem really excited. But it's my baby. And it's hard to let go.\n\nI've talked to Vanessa about some of this stuff, and she seems understanding. But it's still\u2026a lot to process. I just want what's best for the baby. And I want to make sure they're going to a good home. A *real* home. Not just a perfect one.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a weird feeling, you know? Like, giving away a piece of yourself. It's not something you just get over.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Seriously, people have *opinions*, right? And they're not afraid to share them, even when you're, like, super vulnerable and trying to figure out your life.\n\nThe ultrasound technician was the worst. All the little sighs and the \"Are you *sure*?\" It's my body, my decision. It's not a suggestion box. I just wanted to see the baby, not get judged.\n\nWhat I started doing was\u2026 shutting it down. Like, a polite but firm \"Thank you for your concern, but I've thought this through.\" And then just changing the subject. Or staring directly into their eyes until they got uncomfortable. That usually works.\n\nWith Paul and Mark, it was different. They were trying to be supportive, but they didn't really *get* it. I had to explain, over and over, that this wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible, and I knew I couldn't give that to it right now.\n\nI think the key is to remember that *you* are the one making the decision. It's your life, your body, your future. You don't need anyone's permission or approval.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes you just have to tune people out. Put on your headphones, listen to The Moldy Peaches, and pretend they're not even there. It's not the most mature thing to do, but it's sometimes the only way to survive.\n\nIt's hard. It really is. But you have to be strong. You have to believe in your decision. And you have to remember that you're doing what's best for everyone involved. Even if it doesn't feel like it at the time.\n\nAnd if someone is being really awful, just tell them to mind their own business. Seriously. You don't owe them an explanation. You just owe it to yourself to do what's right.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a tough one to talk about. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? No swelling music or instant maternal connection. It was\u2026weird.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026shock. Like, *that's* it? That blurry little blob is\u2026me? And Paul? It was so small and alien-looking. It didn't even look like a baby. It looked like a tiny, gray peanut.\n\nThen came the\u2026panic. A whole lot of panic. Because suddenly it wasn't just a theoretical thing anymore. It was *real*. And I was responsible for it. And I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nThere was a little bit of\u2026fear, too. Fear of the future, fear of being a mom, fear of messing everything up. I mean, I was still trying to figure out my own life, and now I was supposed to be responsible for another human being? It was terrifying.\n\nBut underneath all that, there was something else. Something\u2026soft. A little flicker of\u2026hope, maybe? And a weird kind of protectiveness. Like, even though it was just a tiny peanut, I already wanted to keep it safe.\n\nIt wasn't love, not yet. It was more like\u2026a sense of responsibility. And a growing awareness that my life was about to change in a big way.\n\nIt was complicated. It was messy. It was definitely not what I expected. But it was\u2026something. And I knew, even then, that it was going to be okay. Eventually.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't a single emotion, it was a whole jumble of them. And it took a while for those emotions to sort themselves out. It's still sorting itself out, honestly.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a *moment*, alright? A complicated moment. And honestly, it wasn't just about the Tic Tacs. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, and definitely not the guy I thought I was into. But he was there. He listened. And he was genuinely nice. And I was, like, a total mess, okay? Pregnant, confused, trying to figure out my life.\n\nThe Tic Tacs were\u2026a signal. A way to say, \"I'm freaking out, and I don't know what I'm doing, and I need you to notice me.\" It was a desperate attempt to communicate something I couldn't actually put into words.\n\nAnd yeah, it was a little bit passive-aggressive. Okay, maybe a lot passive-aggressive. But I wasn't exactly known for my direct communication skills at the time.\n\nPlus, it was kinda funny. In a dark, self-deprecating way. And I needed to laugh.\n\nIt wasn't about *wanting* him to be the father, exactly. It was about\u2026acknowledging the situation. And maybe, just maybe, hoping he'd understand.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, I admit it. But it was *my* stupid thing to do. And it was a part of my story. And honestly, if I hadn't put all those Tic Tacs in his mailbox, things might have turned out a lot differently.\n\nSo yeah, that's why. It was a mess of hormones, anxiety, and a whole lot of Tic Tacs. Don't judge me. You weren't there.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive all that awkwardness. It was\u2026a lot. So, Bleeker. Yeah.\n\nBefore I, like, actually *told* him how I felt, things were\u2026comfortable. We were just buddies. We played guitar together, he was always there, you know? A solid, quiet presence. It was good. Safe.\n\nBut then I blurted it all out, right? In the van, after the whole Paul situation. It was a disaster. He was\u2026stunned. He didn't say much, which is pretty much Bleeker's default setting, but you could tell he was freaked out.\n\nFor a while after that, things were super weird. Like, actively painful. We avoided each other. It was like an elephant was sitting in every room we were both in. He was trying to be nice, but it was strained. He kept giving me these little, apologetic looks, and it just made everything worse.\n\nI think he was scared. He's not exactly the most\u2026assertive person. And I think he was worried about ruining our friendship. Which, honestly, was a valid concern.\n\nIt took a long time for things to get back to normal. We started hanging out again, but it was different. There was this unspoken thing between us. We were both tiptoeing around each other, trying not to say the wrong thing.\n\nEventually, we just\u2026talked. Really talked. He explained that he wasn't ready for a relationship, that he was still figuring things out. And I realized that I was okay with that. I mean, I was still a little bummed, but I understood.\n\nOur friendship didn't go back to exactly how it was before, but it evolved. It became\u2026deeper, I guess. We were more honest with each other. And we both learned a lot about ourselves.\n\nIt wasn't the romantic ending I maybe secretly hoped for, but it was a good ending. We're still friends. And sometimes, that's enough. Especially with Bleeker. He's a good guy. Just\u2026a little bit of a space cadet.\n\n\n\nIt was messy, and awkward, and totally worth it, in the end. Because even though we didn't end up together, I learned a lot about what I wanted, and what I didn't want, in a relationship. And that's important, right?", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the Bleeker thing. It's still kinda\u2026raw, honestly. But fine, I'll explain.\n\nThe chalk message? It wasn't just some random act of teenage angst, okay? It was\u2026a statement. A desperate attempt to get his attention. And to make *him* understand what I was feeling.\n\nSee, Bleeker, he's\u2026well, he's Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, and totally oblivious to everything going on around him. He didn't even *know* I was pregnant for, like, forever. And when he finally found out, he just\u2026froze. He didn't say anything. He didn't do anything. He just stared at me with those big, confused eyes.\n\nSo, the chalk message \u2013 \"Supernova\" \u2013 it was a reference to this song we both liked. It was *our* song. And it was a way of saying, \"Look, I'm still here. I'm still me. And this whole situation is a big, messy, exploding thing, and you need to acknowledge it!\"\n\nIt was a plea for him to grow up, to take responsibility, to just\u2026*care*.\n\nIt didn't exactly work, obviously. He still didn't really get it. But it was important for *me* to do it. It was a way of asserting myself, of saying, \"I'm not going to just disappear. I'm going to make you see me.\"\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, maybe. But it was also\u2026honest. And sometimes, honesty is all you have.\n\nIt was a supernova of feelings, I guess. And I needed him to see it, even if he didn't understand it. It was a mess, but it was *my* mess. And I needed to own it.\n\n\n\nUgh. Talking about it makes me cringe. But yeah, that's the significance of the chalk message. It was a desperate cry for connection. And a really awkward moment for everyone involved.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so, Bleeker wasn't exactly who I pictured as my\u2026support system, you know? He's kinda quiet and awkward and spends most of his time with his guitar. But honestly? He was a lifesaver. A really, really quiet, guitar-playing lifesaver.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026there. He didn't freak out when I told him. He didn't try to fix things or give me a bunch of advice. He just\u2026listened. And he kept making me mix CDs. Which, okay, is his way of showing emotion, I guess. But it was nice. It was a distraction.\n\nBut it became more than that. He was the one person who didn't treat me like I was broken or stupid or a mistake. Everyone else was all, \"Oh, poor Juno!\" or \"What are you going to do?\" Bleeker just\u2026accepted it. He accepted *me*.\n\nHe came with me to doctor's appointments, even though he looked like he wanted to disappear into the floor. He helped me research adoption agencies. He even tried to learn how to knit a baby blanket, which was a disaster, but it was the thought that counted.\n\nAnd he didn't judge me when I was being a sarcastic mess or when I was totally freaking out. He just\u2026sat with me. And played his guitar.\n\nHe wasn't perfect. He was still Bleeker. But he was *there*. And that's what mattered. He reminded me that I wasn't alone. That even though I was making a really hard decision, I still had someone who cared about me.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I could have gotten through it without him. He wasn't the dad, obviously. But he was\u2026a friend. A really good friend. And sometimes, that's all you need. He showed me that even when things are messy and complicated, there's still room for kindness and support. And that's a pretty valuable lesson, you know?", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks me about that. Like it's some deep, philosophical statement. It wasn't, honestly. It was more\u2026practical. And kinda lazy.\n\nLook, I was already dealing with a lot, okay? Unexpected pregnancy, adoption, trying to figure out my life\u2026adding \"boy or girl?\" to the list just felt like extra work. It wasn't gonna change anything, you know? I was giving the baby up for adoption, and the parents-to-be, Mark and Vanessa, they didn't want to know either. They wanted to be surprised.\n\nAnd honestly, I figured it was their baby, not mine. They deserved the surprise. I didn't need to know. It didn't make me love the baby any less, or feel any less connected. It just\u2026wasn't my business, I guess.\n\nPlus, I kinda liked the mystery of it. It felt more\u2026open-ended. Like anything was possible. If I'd known it was a boy or a girl, I think I would have started imagining a specific future for the baby, and that felt weird. I wanted the parents to have that space to create their own vision.\n\nIt wasn't about being cool or making a statement. It was just\u2026easier. And more respectful. And honestly, I had enough on my plate without worrying about whether I needed to buy blue or pink stuff.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I didn't find out. It was a practical decision. And it felt right. Don't overthink it.", "Ugh. Okay. You went *there*. A \"scary neuter-baby.\" That's...a very specific and frankly disturbing phrase. Paul came up with something similar, actually. He called it a \"demon spawn.\" He has a vivid imagination.\n\nLook, the whole thing is weird, right? Like, Mark is a perfectly nice guy, but he's...not exactly equipped for fatherhood. He's still figuring out how to be a functional adult, let alone raise a kid. And the thought of him accidentally passing on some\u2026 questionable genetic material is definitely unsettling.\n\nIt's not that I think there's anything *wrong* with him, exactly. It's just...he's kinda clueless. And babies are a lot of work. And a clueless dad is a recipe for disaster.\n\nI mean, I'm already giving this baby up, so I'm trying to be all mature and selfless about it. But the thought of it ending up with someone who's gonna teach it to, like, collect bottle caps or something is\u2026stressful.\n\nIt's not about wanting a \"perfect\" family, okay? It's about wanting this kid to have a good life. A stable life. A life where they're loved and supported and encouraged to be themselves.\n\nSo yeah, the possibility of a \"scary neuter-baby\" is definitely a concern. It's one of the reasons I'm being so careful about choosing the right adoptive parents. They need to be responsible, and capable, and\u2026not Mark.\n\nIt's a lot to think about. And honestly, it's kinda terrifying. But I'm trying to stay positive. And hoping for the best. And maybe investing in some earplugs, just in case.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so describing my relationship with Paul\u2026Bleeker\u2026is complicated. It's not like in a movie, where everything is all sparkly and perfect. It's\u2026messy. And awkward. And surprisingly sweet, sometimes.\n\nAt first, he was just\u2026there. Like a fixture. Always at the skate park, always offering me a juice box, always being relentlessly, annoyingly nice. I mostly just ignored him. He was kinda dorky, and I was trying to be cool. You know?\n\nBut then\u2026things happened. And he was just\u2026there for me. Through everything. He didn't judge me, he didn't try to fix me, he just\u2026listened. And he brought me snacks. Which is always a good thing.\n\nIt wasn't like I suddenly fell head-over-heels for him. It was more like\u2026a slow realization that he was a good person. A really good person. And that he actually *got* me, even when I didn't get myself.\n\nWe're not, like, a typical couple. We don't do a lot of dates or hand-holding or mushy stuff. We mostly just hang out and talk. And play video games. And he still brings me juice boxes sometimes.\n\nHe's my best friend, I guess. And maybe\u2026maybe something more. I don't know. I'm not good at labels.\n\nIt's just\u2026comfortable. And safe. And he makes me laugh. And he doesn't try to change me. Which is more than I can say for a lot of people.\n\nSo yeah, that's my relationship with Bleeker. It's not perfect, but it's real. And it's\u2026good. It's really good. Don't tell him I said that, though. He'll get all weird.", "Ugh, okay, talking about family. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie situation, you know?\n\nMy mom, Bren, she was\u2026a lot. At first, she was totally freaked out. Like, full-on panic mode. She kept trying to get me to, like, magically undo it. Which, newsflash, Mom, that's not how this works. But she came around. Eventually. She started knitting baby stuff, which was\u2026intense. And she definitely had opinions on everything. Everything.\n\nShe wasn't always *good* at showing support, if that makes sense. It was more like\u2026she was trying to fix things, instead of just being there for me. But she did try. And she did eventually accept it. And she helped me tell my dad. That was\u2026rough.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he was\u2026Mac. He's a pretty quiet guy. He didn't say a lot, but he was always there. He built me a rocking chair for the baby. Which was surprisingly sweet. And he drove me to all my appointments. He just\u2026showed up. That's his way.\n\nAnd then there was my step-dad, Mark. He was\u2026surprisingly awesome. He was the one who really stepped up and tried to understand. He wasn't my biological dad, but he treated me like I was his daughter. He even offered to adopt the baby. Which was\u2026a lot to process.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. There were definitely awkward moments and tense conversations. But they all showed up. In their own weird, flawed ways. And I realized that even though they didn't always know what to say or do, they loved me. And they wanted what was best for me and the baby.\n\nIt wasn't the family I expected, but it was the family I had. And they got me through it. They really did. It wasn't easy, but I wouldn't have wanted to do it without them. Even Bren and her endless knitting.", "Ugh, okay, you're going *there*. It's not exactly my favorite topic, but fine. Let's talk about the messy stuff.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope well, at first. I just\u2026avoided it. I used sarcasm and snark as a shield. Made fun of everything, including myself. It was easier than actually *feeling* things.\n\nBut that only works for so long. When you're carrying around a secret like that, a whole other person growing inside you, it kinda forces you to deal with stuff.\n\nThe biggest thing was probably talking to someone. Not just Bleeker, though he was good for awkward silences and guitar serenades. I mean, really talking to someone. Paul and Vanessa, mostly. They didn't judge me. They just\u2026listened. And they let me be angry and scared and confused without trying to fix everything.\n\nIt also helped to realize I wasn't alone. My mom, she'd been through her own stuff. And even though we don't always see eye-to-eye, she was there for me in her own way.\n\nThe identity crisis part\u2026that was harder. I was just starting to figure out who I was, and then suddenly I was responsible for another human being. It was terrifying. I felt like I was losing myself.\n\nWhat helped with that was realizing that becoming a mom didn't have to define me. I could still be Juno. I could still be sarcastic and independent and a little bit weird. I just had to add \"responsible adult\" to the list.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears and a lot of self-doubt. But I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd honestly, the whole experience made me stronger. It forced me to grow up and face my fears. And it taught me that even when things are really messy and complicated, there's always hope.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I coped. Or, at least, that's how I *tried* to cope. It's still a work in progress, you know? I'm still figuring things out. But I'm getting there.\n\n\n\nIt's not a glamorous story, but it's my story. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a lifetime supply of tater tots. But that's beside the point.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me. It's The Moldy Peaches. Obviously.\n\nLike, duh.\n\nThey're just\u2026real. You know? They don't try to be cool or polished or anything. They just write songs about their feelings, and they're kinda weird and awkward and heartbreakingly honest. \n\nKimya Dawson's lyrics are like she's reading my diary. She gets it. She gets the feeling of being a misfit, of being confused, of just wanting to be accepted for who you are. \n\nAnd the music is simple, but it's really effective. It's just acoustic guitar and ukulele and a little bit of percussion, but it's enough. It's raw and emotional and it makes me feel\u2026something.\n\nA lot of music feels fake, you know? Like it's trying too hard to be something it's not. But The Moldy Peaches are just themselves. And that's really refreshing.\n\nPlus, their songs are kinda funny. Even when they're sad. It's like they're saying, \"Yeah, life is messed up, but we can still laugh about it.\"\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. Don't even try to argue with me. You just don't get it if you don't get it. And that's okay. But seriously, listen to \"Anyone Else But You.\" It'll change your life. Maybe.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It's like, everything is already a mess when you're sixteen, right? Hormones, school, trying to figure out who you are\u2026and then BAM. Positive pregnancy test. It's not exactly a recipe for a chill adolescence.\n\nNavigating my identity? That's the biggest part, honestly. Before all this, I was just\u2026Juno. A girl who liked records and sarcastic comments and avoiding drama. Now I'm \"Juno, the pregnant girl.\" And it feels like everyone has an opinion on who I should be, what I should do.\n\nMaking decisions is\u2026terrifying. Like, every single choice feels huge. It's not just about what *I* want anymore. It's about this little person who's depending on me. And that's a lot of pressure.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's like, I'm still trying to figure out what *I* want out of life, and now I have to figure out what's best for someone else too. And I'm supposed to be doing all this while also going to school and dealing with my parents and trying to maintain some semblance of a normal life? It's exhausting.\n\nAnd it's lonely, sometimes. Even with Paul and my dad and Leah, it feels like no one really *gets* it. They try, but they can't possibly understand what it's like to be in my shoes.\n\nSo yeah, it's challenging. It's scary. It's overwhelming. But I'm trying. I'm trying to figure things out, to make the best decisions I can, and to be a good mom. Even if I have no idea what I'm doing.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. And sometimes, I just want to curl up in a ball and listen to The Moldy Peaches until it all goes away. But that's not an option, is it? So I just keep going. One day at a time.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026emotional? Fine. But don't expect a Hallmark movie speech, alright?\n\nLook, before all this happened with Paulie Bleeker and, you know, *the situation*, I thought love was just\u2026something in movies. Like, a grand gesture or a perfect moment. It seemed kinda silly, honestly. And responsibility? That was something my parents talked about, not something I really *felt*.\n\nThen I found out I was pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. It wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person, this life, that was depending on me. And that was terrifying.\n\nI thought about all the things I *couldn't* give a baby. A stable home, a lot of money, a perfect life. And I realized that the most loving thing I could do was to find someone who *could*.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it forced me to really think about what love means. It's not about keeping something for yourself, it's about wanting what's best for someone else, even if it hurts.\n\nAnd responsibility? That hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn't just about carrying a baby for nine months. It was about making a plan, about thinking through all the consequences, about making a selfless decision.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted my baby, and how much they wanted a child\u2026that showed me a different kind of love. A quiet, steady, hopeful kind of love. It wasn't flashy or dramatic, but it was real.\n\nAnd Paulie\u2026well, Paulie was always there. He didn't run away, he didn't judge me. He just\u2026supported me. And that showed me that love isn't always about grand gestures, it's about being there for someone, even when things are messy and complicated.\n\nSo, yeah, my journey changed everything. It taught me that love isn't just a feeling, it's a choice. And responsibility isn't a burden, it's a privilege. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. And it's about being brave enough to do what's right, even when it's hard.\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. It made me who I am. And that's\u2026something.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. Don't think you're gonna get me all emotional or anything. But yeah, it's a thing I think about. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't like in the movies, okay? There wasn't, like, a sudden rush of maternal instinct or anything. It wasn't all sparkly and perfect. It was\u2026weird. And kinda scary.\n\nI mean, I knew I was giving him up. That was the whole plan. But seeing him\u2026actually *there*\u2026it was different. He was so small. And wrinkly. And he smelled like\u2026a hospital. Not in a bad way, just\u2026clinical.\n\nI remember being really, really quiet. And trying not to cry. Because crying wouldn't help anything. And I didn't want the nurses to think I was changing my mind. Because I wasn't. I *wasn't*.\n\nBut it was hard. It was really hard. He was a real person. A tiny, helpless real person. And I was supposed to just\u2026hand him over?\n\nI held him for a little while. Just long enough to feel his weight in my arms. And to memorize his face. And to say goodbye.\n\nIt wasn't love, not exactly. It was\u2026something else. A kind of protective feeling. And a really, really big sadness.\n\nI think I mostly felt relieved, honestly. Relieved that it was over. Relieved that he was healthy. And relieved that I had made the right decision.\n\nBut it still stung. It still does, sometimes. It's not something you just forget. It's a part of me now. A weird, complicated, kinda sad part.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I felt. It wasn't magical. It was real. And it was hard. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. And it still kinda stings to think about, honestly. It wasn't like I was trying to *hide* it from him, exactly. It was more\u2026I didn't want to mess things up.\n\nPaulie and I, we had a thing. A good thing. But it was kinda\u2026comfortable. And I was scared that if I told him I was pregnant, it would change everything. That he'd freak out and want nothing to do with me. Or worse, that he'd feel obligated to be with me, and we'd end up stuck in some weird, unhappy situation.\n\nI was already giving the baby up for adoption, right? I'd made that decision. And I didn't want to drag Paulie into it. I didn't want him to feel like he had to be a dad if he wasn't ready. Or if he didn't even *want* to be.\n\nIt was selfish, I guess. But I was just trying to protect him. And protect myself. I was a mess, okay? I was sixteen and pregnant and trying to figure out my life. I didn't need any more drama.\n\nI thought I could handle it on my own. I thought I could just\u2026get through it. And then tell him after everything was over. But it was stupid. It was a mistake.\n\nI should have told him. He deserved to know. He would have been there for me, I know he would have. But I was too scared. Too stubborn. Too\u2026me.\n\nIt took a long time for me to realize that. And it took a long time for Paulie and me to get back to where we were. But we did. And that's what matters.\n\nIt was a dumb decision, looking back. But I was a dumb kid. And I did the best I could with what I had. And sometimes, that's all you can do.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026a whole thing. It's still embarrassing to think about, honestly.\n\nSo, I was trying to be all cool and independent and not burden Paulie with my problems, right? Like, I was gonna tell him eventually, but I wanted to have everything figured out first. Which, looking back, was totally ridiculous.\n\nBut Mark, that\u2026well, Mark is not a discreet person. He's got a big mouth and zero filter. He overheard me talking to my mom on the phone about the pregnancy test. He didn't get all the details, but he put two and two together.\n\nAnd then, get this, he *told* Paulie. Not directly, of course. He had to make it dramatic. He told Paulie I was \"going through something\" and that he \"couldn't say what,\" but that Paulie should \"be there for me.\"\n\nSeriously. The nerve of that guy.\n\nPaulie, being Paulie, immediately figured it out. He's not stupid. He just pretends to be sometimes. He confronted me at the arcade, which was mortifying. Surrounded by flashing lights and the sound of Pac-Man. Not exactly the romantic setting I had in mind.\n\nSo yeah, Mark spilled the beans. It wasn't a direct confession from me, but it was close enough. And honestly, I was kinda relieved when he found out. It was one less thing to worry about.\n\nBut I still gave Mark a piece of my mind. And I made him buy me a lot of ice cream. It didn't fix everything, but it helped.\n\nIt just goes to show, you can't keep secrets from people forever. Especially not when Mark is involved. He's a walking, talking disaster. But he's *my* walking, talking disaster. Sometimes.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know about *that*. It's not like I sat down and made a pros and cons list, you know? It wasn't a logical decision. It was\u2026 messy.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026freaked out. Totally and completely freaked out. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this. Paul was sweet, but he was even *more* clueless than I was.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it. Really thinking. And I realized I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my life. I had plans, you know? I wanted to go to college, I wanted to travel, I wanted to\u2026figure things out.\n\nAnd it wasn't fair to the baby. A baby deserves parents who are ready and willing and able to give it everything it needs. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't provide that right then.\n\nAdoption felt\u2026right. It felt like the best way to give the baby a good life. A life with parents who were excited and prepared and could give it all the love and support it deserved.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. Choosing a family was\u2026intense. I wanted to make sure the baby was going to a good home. And saying goodbye\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut I knew it was the right decision. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's still\u2026complicated. I still think about the baby sometimes. But I know it's with a loving family, and that makes me feel\u2026okay. It doesn't erase the sadness, but it makes it bearable.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect solution, but it was the best one. And I wouldn't change it. It made me grow up, you know? It made me realize what's really important in life. And it taught me that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the right ones.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* me on Bleeker. Seriously. That whole situation was\u2026a mess.\n\nWhen he said he didn't want to see the baby? It felt like someone punched me in the gut. Like, a really hard punch. And not the fun kind, like when you're sparring with your dad. Just\u2026a hollow, awful feeling.\n\nI mean, I knew he was kinda\u2026immature. And flaky. And obsessed with his band. But I thought, maybe, just maybe, he'd step up. That he'd want to be part of this, even if he wasn't ready to be a dad.\n\nBut no. He just\u2026didn't want to deal with it. He said it would mess with his \"creative process.\" His *creative process*! Like, a human being is messing with his art? Give me a break.\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, really. It was about him. About his fear of responsibility. About his inability to grow up.\n\nI was so angry. And sad. And confused. I wanted to yell at him, to shake him, to make him understand what he was giving up. But I couldn't. Because he was Bleeker. And he was always going to be Bleeker.\n\nIt made me realize that I couldn't rely on him. That I was on my own. And that was scary. But it was also\u2026liberating. Because it meant I could make my own decisions. I could choose the best life for the baby, without having to worry about what he thought.\n\nIt sucked, though. It really, really sucked. And I don't think I'll ever fully understand why he couldn't just\u2026be a decent human being. But I moved on. I had to. For the baby. And for myself.\n\n\n\nHonestly, just thinking about it makes me want to listen to The Moldy Peaches and eat a whole bag of cheese puffs. It was a rough time.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? No swelling orchestral music or slow-motion crying. It was just\u2026weird. And kinda messy. And surprisingly okay.\n\nI\u2019d spent nine months carrying this kid, right? Feeling it kick and punch and generally make a nuisance of itself. And then, boom. It was over. And there was Vanessa.\n\nShe looked\u2026a disaster. Her hair was all over the place, she was wearing this ridiculously oversized sweater, and there were crumbs on her face. Like, actual crumbs. And the baby, little Frank, was swaddled in a blanket that was probably older than I am. It was chaos.\n\nBut she was *glowing*. Seriously. Like, radiating happiness. And she was looking at Frank like he was the eighth wonder of the world. And it hit me, right then, that this was right. This was supposed to happen.\n\nIt was\u2026bittersweet, obviously. A huge, gaping hole opened up in my chest, and I wanted to snatch him back and just\u2026hold him forever. But I didn\u2019t. Because I knew Vanessa could give him a better life than I could. A stable life. A loving life.\n\nSeeing her, all disorganized and happy, with *my* baby\u2026it was like watching a dream unfold for someone else. A good dream. A dream I helped create.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It still isn\u2019t easy. There are days when I miss him so much it physically hurts. But seeing Vanessa with Frank\u2026it makes it a little bit easier. It reminds me that I made the right decision. That I did something good.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and totally imperfect. But it was also beautiful. And that\u2019s all that really matters, I guess.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain. It\u2019s not a feeling you can really put into words. It just\u2026is. And it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just\u2026okay.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all mushy. It's embarrassing. But fine, you asked.\n\nThat song\u2026 \u201cAnyone Else But You\u201d by The Moldy Peaches\u2026 it's kinda the whole story of Paul and me, condensed into three minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Seriously.\n\nBefore Paul, I was all about keeping my distance. Building walls. Being sarcastic. You know, the whole Juno thing. I didn't want to get hurt. I didn't want to let anyone in. I was convinced I was better off on my own.\n\nAnd then Paul showed up. And he was\u2026nice. Too nice, almost. And he liked me, even with all my baggage. And I started to like him back. Which was terrifying.\n\nThat song\u2026it's about wanting someone so badly, but being scared to admit it. It's about the awkwardness and the vulnerability and the fear of rejection. It's about realizing that maybe, just maybe, you're not as independent as you thought you were.\n\nWe listened to it a lot. Like, *a lot*. It was our song, I guess. It was a way of acknowledging the messiness of our feelings without actually having to, like, *talk* about them. Which was easier for both of us.\n\nIt's also kinda ironic, right? The song is about wanting anyone *but* the person you're with. But for us, it was about realizing that I didn't want anyone *but* Paul. Even though he was a total dork sometimes.\n\nIt's a stupid song, honestly. But it's *our* stupid song. And it reminds me of a time when I was figuring things out, and falling in love, and being completely terrified all at the same time.\n\nSo yeah, it's significant. It's a reminder that even the most awkward and complicated relationships can be beautiful. And that sometimes, the best things in life are the things you never expected.\n\nDon't tell Paul I said any of this. He'll get all sappy. And I'll never live it down.", "Ugh, okay, so you noticed the awkwardness, huh? Good. Because it's *thick*. It's like wading through molasses made of polite smiles and side-eye.\n\nLook, it's not exactly a traditional situation, right? I'm, like, seventeen. And I'm giving the baby up for adoption. It's not a \"celebrate the impending arrival of a bundle of joy\" kind of vibe. It's more of a \"support a girl who's making a really hard decision\" kind of vibe.\n\nI think people are tripping over themselves trying to be sensitive. They don't want to make me feel bad, but they also don't want to ignore the fact that I'm, you know, *giving the baby away*. It's a weird tightrope walk.\n\nMy mom's trying, bless her heart. She's all about the decorations and the cake, but even she seems a little\u2026hesitant. Like she's afraid to get too excited. And Paul and Mark? They're just confused. They want to be supportive, but they don't really know what that looks like in this situation.\n\nI think they're worried about sending the wrong message. Like, are they celebrating the adoption? Are they celebrating *me* being pregnant? It's a mess.\n\nHonestly, I don't really *need* a baby shower. It's not like I'm gonna keep the baby and need a bunch of tiny clothes and bottles. But it's nice that they want to do something. It just\u2026feels complicated.\n\nIt's like they're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. And it's making everyone uncomfortable. I just wish they'd relax and be themselves. It's okay to be a little weird. It's okay to acknowledge that this is a strange situation.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. And sometimes, I just want everyone to stop tiptoeing around and just *talk* to me. Like a normal person. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh, okay, Bren. She's\u2026intense. And sometimes she doesn't get it. It's not like I was having a secret romance with Mark or anything! It's just\u2026he had good taste in music and movies, okay? And he was *nice*. Which is a rare commodity in this town.\n\nI think she felt like I was getting too close to him, and that it was inappropriate. Like, I was supposed to be focusing on the baby and the adoption and being a responsible adult, and instead I was bonding with a semi-creepy music enthusiast.\n\nAnd I guess she was worried about me getting my hopes up. Like, she thought I was looking for something more from Mark than just friendship. Which, okay, maybe I was a little bit. But it wasn't like I was planning to run away with him or anything!\n\nShe's just really protective, you know? She cares about me, and she wants me to make good decisions. And she thinks Mark is a bad influence. Which, honestly, he kind of is. But he's a *fun* bad influence.\n\nI think she also felt like I wasn't being honest with her about my feelings. Like, I was downplaying how much I enjoyed spending time with Mark. And she's right, I probably was. I'm not always the best at expressing my emotions.\n\nIt's complicated. She's my friend, and I respect her opinion. But I also think she needs to chill out a little bit. I'm not a little kid. I can make my own decisions. Even if they're bad ones.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of distraction from the whole pregnancy thing was a good thing. It helped me to feel normal for a while. But Bren doesn't see it that way. She just sees it as me being irresponsible.\n\nUgh. Friends. They're the best, and the worst.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about my mom? Fine. It's a whole thing. She thinks I'm, like, emotionally stunted or something. Like I live in a bubble of indie rock and sarcastic comments. Which, okay, maybe I do a little.\n\nBut it's not that I don't *know* about marriage. It's that I don't romanticize it. She and my dad\u2026well, it wasn't exactly a fairytale. He left when I was pretty young, to pursue his \"artistic vision,\" which basically meant he wanted to run off with a pottery teacher. So, yeah, my view of marriage is a little\u2026skewed.\n\nShe thinks I think it's all just about grand gestures and happily ever afters. And she's right, I *used* to. But then I actually had to deal with, like, real life stuff. And I realized it's way more complicated than that. It's about compromise and communication and, like, doing the dishes even when you don't want to.\n\nShe thinks I'm naive because I don't believe in soulmates or destiny or any of that stuff. I think people make choices, and relationships take work. And sometimes, they just don't work out. It's not always someone's \"fault.\"\n\nShe wants me to believe in love, I guess. She wants me to have a happy ending. But she doesn't understand that I'm trying to be realistic. I'm trying to protect myself.\n\nIt's not that I don't want a relationship. It's just that I'm not going to settle for anything less than something real. And I'm not going to pretend that it's going to be easy.\n\nSo, yeah, she thinks I don't know anything about the dynamics of marriage. And maybe she's right. But I think I know a lot about the dynamics of *people*. And that's probably more important anyway.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't ask me to explain it any further. It's exhausting just thinking about it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, yeah, adoption! Great plan!\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It was realizing I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't equipped to give a baby the life it deserved. Not yet.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? I did. I just\u2026knew I couldn't give it everything it needed. A stable home, financial security, a future. I was still in high school, living with my dad, and barely able to keep my grades up.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. I wanted it to have parents who were ready, who were excited, who could give it everything it deserved. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were perfect. They were already planning a nursery and talking about college funds. I could never have provided that.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. The hardest I've ever made. But I knew it was the right one. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt's still\u2026weird, sometimes. Thinking about a little kid out there who's part of me. But I know it's a good life. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't a selfless act, exactly. It was\u2026realistic. And a little bit selfish, maybe. I wanted to be able to finish school, to have a future for myself. But mostly, I just wanted the baby to be happy. And I knew that wasn't going to happen with me, at least not then.\n\n\n\nIt's a long story. And it's not something I talk about a lot. But it's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't change it. Even though it was really, really hard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a fun, \"I discovered I love pottery!\" kind of learning. It was more like\u2026a forced evolution.\n\nBefore all this, I thought I had things figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, and pretty good at keeping people at arm's length. I thought that was strength. Turns out, it was mostly fear.\n\nBeing pregnant\u2026it just kinda ripped all that away. Suddenly, I was responsible for another human being. And that was terrifying. It made me realize I wasn't as tough as I thought I was. I was scared, and vulnerable, and completely clueless.\n\nI learned that I'm capable of a lot more than I thought I was. I mean, I carried a baby for nine months! That's pretty intense. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help. I couldn't have done it without my dad, and Paul, and even Vanessa, surprisingly.\n\nI also learned that love isn't always what you expect it to be. It's not always romantic or dramatic. Sometimes, it's just quiet and steady and\u2026real. The love I felt for the baby, even knowing I was giving it up, was\u2026different. It was complicated.\n\nAnd I learned that making a difficult decision doesn't mean you're a bad person. It means you're brave enough to do what's right, even when it hurts.\n\nHonestly, it was a mess. But it was a mess that made me\u2026grow up. I'm still figuring things out, but I'm not as afraid anymore. I'm a little less sarcastic, a little more open, and a lot more aware of my own strength.\n\nIt wasn't what I planned, but it was exactly what I needed. It forced me to confront who I was, and who I wanted to be. And that's\u2026something.", "Ugh, okay, talking about Vanessa and Mark\u2026it\u2019s complicated. It wasn\u2019t like, instant best friends, you know? At first, it was\u2026awkward. Really awkward. They were, like, *perfect*. Perfect house, perfect jobs, perfect everything. And me? I was just\u2026me. A pregnant teenager with a penchant for vintage clothes and a sarcastic attitude.\n\nAt the beginning, it felt like an interview. They were asking all these questions, trying to figure out if I was \u201cresponsible\u201d enough to give them their baby. And I was trying to figure out if they were\u2026real. Like, did they actually want a kid, or did they just want a picture-perfect family?\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to change. We started just\u2026talking. Not about the baby, or the adoption, or all the legal stuff. We talked about music, and movies, and our families. I learned that Vanessa was a total perfectionist, but she was also really kind and funny. And Mark\u2026Mark was just a good guy. Quiet, but really thoughtful.\n\nThe more time we spent together, the more I realized they weren\u2019t trying to judge me. They were just trying to understand me. And they were genuinely excited about becoming parents.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always easy. There were definitely moments of tension and disagreement. Especially when we talked about the open adoption. I wanted to be a part of the baby\u2019s life, and they were hesitant at first. But we talked it through, and we eventually came to an agreement that worked for everyone.\n\nBy the end of the process, it wasn\u2019t just about giving them a baby. It was about building a relationship. They weren\u2019t just the \u201cadoptive parents,\u201d they were Vanessa and Mark. And I wasn\u2019t just the \u201cbirth mother,\u201d I was Juno.\n\nIt was weird, and messy, and emotional. But it was also\u2026beautiful. They became a second family to me. And I hope I became a good friend to them. It wasn\u2019t the family I expected, but it was the family I needed.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026something I think about a lot. It\u2019s not easy giving up a baby. But knowing that he was going to be loved and cared for by Vanessa and Mark made it a little bit easier. And knowing that I would still be a part of his life\u2026that meant everything.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like I haven't thought about it, you know? A *lot*. Especially late at night when I can't sleep.\n\nRegrets? Not exactly. I mean, I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time. And I still believe giving the baby up for adoption was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.\n\nBut\u2026there are moments. Moments where I wonder what it would have been like. What she's like. What her name is. If she likes music as much as I do. If she's as sarcastic.\n\nIt's not a *sad* feeling, exactly. It's more\u2026a wistful one. Like looking at a photograph of a life you almost lived.\n\nI guess I regret not being\u2026stronger, maybe. Not being able to provide for her myself. But I knew I wasn't ready. I was a kid. I still *am* a kid, kinda.\n\nAnd I regret the awkwardness with Paul. That was\u2026messy. We were both just trying to figure things out, but it was still hard.\n\nBut mostly, I don't regret giving her a chance at a good life. With parents who were ready and willing and able to give her everything I couldn't. That's what matters.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple story with a happy ending. It's messy and real and full of complicated emotions. And I'm still figuring it all out.\n\nSo, regrets? Not really. Just\u2026what ifs. And a lot of hope that she's happy. That's all I can ask for.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to talk about, honestly. But it's important to be honest about it. It wasn't easy, and it's not something I'll ever forget.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's still kinda raw, you know?\n\nIt wasn't easy. Not at all. People think it was this brave, selfless thing, and it was, I guess. But it was also the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye to that little kid\u2026it felt like ripping a piece of myself away.\n\nFor a long time, I felt\u2026empty. Like something was missing. And I was really scared I'd made the wrong decision. Like, what if they weren't happy? What if they didn't love him? What if I'd ruined his life?\n\nBut then I started to realize that giving him up wasn't about *me*. It was about giving him the best possible life. A life I couldn't give him. Mark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They were going to give him everything he needed.\n\nAnd that helped. A lot.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, really fast. Before, I was just kinda drifting, avoiding responsibility. But having a baby, even for nine months, it changed everything. It made me think about the future, about what I wanted out of life.\n\nIt made me realize I needed to figure out who *I* was, outside of being a mom. And that was\u2026terrifying. But also kinda liberating.\n\nI still think about him, of course. All the time. I get updates from Vanessa, which is good. It's nice to know he's happy and healthy.\n\nIt's not a perfect story. It's messy and complicated and sad. But it's *my* story. And it made me who I am today. It taught me about love, and loss, and sacrifice. And it taught me that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the right ones.\n\nIt definitely made me less cynical, I think. And more\u2026hopeful. Even though life is still kinda weird and unpredictable.\n\nIt's still a part of me, you know? It always will be. But it doesn't define me. It's just\u2026a chapter in my life. A really important chapter. And I'm grateful for it, even though it was painful.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack. Sorry if I'm rambling. It's not something I usually talk about.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. If I could go back and talk to myself, right when I found out\u2026it wouldn't be a pep talk, that's for sure. It would be more like\u2026a reality check.\n\nFirst of all, it's okay to freak out. Seriously. It's a huge thing. You're allowed to be scared, confused, angry, whatever. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nAnd don't let anyone pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. It's *your* body, *your* life, and *your* choice. Period. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they can offer advice, but ultimately, it's up to you.\n\nIt's also okay to ask for help. Don't try to go through this alone. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a friend, a family member, a counselor. There are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to be honest with yourself. About what you want, what you need, and what you're capable of. It's not going to be easy, but it's important to be real with yourself.\n\nGiving a baby up for adoption isn't a failure. It's a brave and selfless decision. It means you're putting the baby's needs first, even when it's the hardest thing you've ever done. It doesn't mean you don't love the baby. It just means you're not ready to be a parent right now.\n\nAnd finally, remember that you're not defined by this. You're still you. You still have dreams and goals and a whole life ahead of you. This is just one chapter in your story. It doesn't have to define the rest of it.\n\nIt's gonna be messy. It's gonna be hard. But you're stronger than you think. And you're not alone. Seriously. You're not.\n\n\n\nJust\u2026breathe. And remember to be kind to yourself. You deserve it.", "Ugh, okay, so the blog. Yeah. That was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't like I *planned* to become some kind of accidental internet sensation, you know? It just kinda\u2026happened.\n\nHonestly? It started because I was bored. And terrified. And I needed to vent to *someone* who wasn't my dad or Paul or even Bleeker. They were all great, but they didn't *get* it. They hadn't, like, accidentally gotten pregnant with a guy they barely knew.\n\nSo I started writing. Just rambling, really. About the morning sickness, the weird cravings, the awkward doctor's appointments. It was a way to process everything, to make sense of it all.\n\nThen, Leah, who's super into the internet and stuff, suggested I put it online. She said it might help other people who were going through similar things. I was hesitant at first. I'm not exactly an over-sharer, you know? But she convinced me.\n\nAnd then\u2026people started reading it. And commenting. And sending me messages. And it was weird. And amazing.\n\nIt turned out a lot of people *were* going through similar things. Or they just wanted to know what it was like. And I realized that maybe, just maybe, my messed-up situation could actually help someone else.\n\nIt was also a way to take control of the narrative, you know? Everyone had an opinion about my pregnancy, and I wanted to tell my story my way.\n\nSo yeah, that's how the blog started. It was a way to cope, to connect, and to reclaim my voice. It wasn't about fame or attention. It was about being real. And maybe, just maybe, making someone else feel a little less alone.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. It wasn't just about the baby, you know? It was about\u2026everything.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Probably that life doesn't go according to plan. Like, *at all*. You can have all these ideas about who you are and what you want, and then BAM! Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly everything's different.\n\nI thought I was so independent, so sure of myself. And then I was faced with this huge responsibility, and I had no clue what I was doing. It was terrifying.\n\nBut it also forced me to grow up. To think about someone other than myself. To make a really hard decision, and to own it.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I mean, I wouldn't have gotten through it without my dad, and Paul, and even Bleeker, surprisingly. They all stepped up in their own weird ways.\n\nAnd I learned that family isn't always about blood. It's about the people who love you and support you, no matter what. Mark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were gonna give this kid a really good life.\n\nBut mostly, I learned that even when things are messy and complicated and scary, you can still find something good. You can still find happiness. And you can still figure things out.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *choosing* a life for that baby. And choosing a life for myself. And that's a pretty powerful thing.\n\nSo yeah. Life doesn't go according to plan. But that doesn't mean it can't be good. It just means you have to be willing to roll with the punches. And maybe eat a lot of tater tots along the way.", "Okay, look. This is\u2026a lot. And it totally sucks. Like, seriously, the worst. But you're here, you're thinking about it, and that's already a good start.\n\nFirst of all: breathe. Just\u2026breathe. It feels like your whole world is falling apart, and maybe it is a little bit, but it's not the end. It's just\u2026a really big change.\n\nSecond: don't let anyone tell you what to do. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they all have opinions, but this is *your* decision. And it's okay to take your time figuring it out. Don't rush into anything.\n\nThere are three main options, right? Raising the kid, adoption, or\u2026well, you know. And all of them are valid. There's no right or wrong answer. It's about what's right for *you*.\n\nIf you're thinking about adoption, don't feel guilty. It's not giving up on the baby, it's giving the baby a life you can't provide right now. And it's a really brave thing to do.\n\nIf you're thinking about raising the kid, that's awesome. It's gonna be hard, but it's also gonna be amazing. But be realistic. It's gonna change your life completely.\n\nAnd if you're thinking about\u2026the other option\u2026that's okay too. It's a tough decision, but it's your decision.\n\nWhatever you choose, talk to someone. A trusted friend, a family member, a counselor. Don't go through this alone.\n\nAnd remember: you're not a bad person. You're just a person facing a really difficult situation. And you're stronger than you think.\n\nIt's gonna be okay. Maybe not right now, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually. You'll figure it out. And you'll get through this. I promise.\n\nAnd seriously, don't listen to anyone who tries to make you feel ashamed or guilty. You deserve support, not judgment. You got this. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026heavy. Thinking about a kid I'm giving up and then imagining their whole life? It's a lot. But if I *have* to, I guess I have some thoughts.\n\nIt's not about them becoming a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that. Honestly, I don't care what they *do*. I just want them to be\u2026happy. Genuinely, truly happy.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, something that makes them excited to get out of bed in the morning. It doesn't have to be glamorous or lucrative or anything. Just something that makes their soul sing.\n\nI want them to be kind. To themselves and to others. The world is a messed up place, and we need more people who are willing to be decent and compassionate.\n\nI want them to be brave. To stand up for what they believe in, even when it's hard. To take risks and try new things. To not be afraid to fail.\n\nI want them to be independent. To think for themselves and make their own choices. To not let anyone tell them who they are or what they should be.\n\nAnd I want them to know that they're loved. Even if I'm not the one raising them. I want them to feel supported and cherished and valued.\n\nI don't want to dictate their life. I just want to give them a good start and then let them go and become whoever they're meant to be.\n\nIt's kinda scary, letting go like that. But I think it's the best thing I can do for them. I want them to have a life that's even better than mine. And I think the best way to do that is to give them the freedom to create it for themselves.\n\nSo yeah. Happy, kind, brave, independent, and loved. That's my ideal vision. It's not too much to ask, is it?", "Ugh, okay, this is a good question. And a frustrating one. People think\u2026they think we\u2019re just\u2026*lost causes*. Like, our lives are over before they even really begin. Like we\u2019re all just irresponsible kids who didn\u2019t think things through.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just\u2026not true.\n\nIt\u2019s not like we *planned* this, okay? It happens. And yeah, it\u2019s scary and complicated and messes with everything. But it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re incapable of making good decisions, or being good mothers, or having a future.\n\nPeople assume we\u2019re all ditching school and living off welfare and just\u2026giving up. And some people do, I guess. But a lot of us are trying really hard. We\u2019re going to school, we\u2019re working, we\u2019re trying to figure out how to be a parent and still be a teenager. It\u2019s a lot.\n\nWe\u2019re not dumb. We\u2019re not lazy. We\u2019re just\u2026young. And we\u2019re dealing with a lot.\n\nI wish people would just see us as people. As individuals. And stop judging us based on stereotypes. We\u2019re not a monolith. We all have our own stories, our own dreams, our own struggles.\n\nAnd honestly? We\u2019re a lot stronger than people give us credit for. We have to be.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026it\u2019s annoying. And it\u2019s unfair. We deserve a little bit of grace, you know? We\u2019re just trying to figure things out. Like everyone else.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026the big question, isn\u2019t it? Everyone always wants to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not wanting the baby, okay? I totally wanted the baby. Like, once I realized I was actually gonna have a human growing inside me, I started picking out names and thinking about nursery themes and stuff. It was weird.\n\nBut I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a kid. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. My life was\u2026messy. And it wasn\u2019t going to magically get less messy just because I had a baby.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she was amazing. She offered to help, and I knew she meant it. But I could see it in her eyes. She was already stretched so thin, working two jobs and trying to keep us afloat. I couldn\u2019t ask her to do that, and then also raise a baby. That wouldn\u2019t be fair to her, or to the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? I didn\u2019t want the baby to grow up in a situation where it was\u2026a burden. I wanted it to have everything. A stable home, two loving parents, opportunities I couldn\u2019t provide.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. They were ready. They were excited. They had a beautiful home and a garden and a dog. They were everything I wanted for my baby.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about giving it *away*. It was about giving it *to* them. Giving it the best possible life.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right decision. For me, for the baby, for everyone involved.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy ending, exactly. But it was a\u2026good ending. And sometimes, that\u2019s enough.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s complicated, okay? It\u2019s not a simple story with a neat little bow on top. It\u2019s messy and real and heartbreaking and hopeful all at the same time. And it\u2019s my story.", "Ugh, okay, that was\u2026a process. Seriously. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It was a *baby*. My baby. And finding the right people to raise him was, like, the biggest decision of my life.\n\nAt first, I was kinda overwhelmed. There were so many couples. Some were super eager, some were kinda weird, and some just\u2026didn't feel right. I met a lot of people who seemed perfect on paper, but when I actually talked to them, something felt off.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they were different. They weren't trying to be perfect. They were just\u2026real. They were a little quirky, a little awkward, and they admitted they were scared. And that, honestly, was kinda refreshing.\n\nVanessa, she was a little bit older, and she hadn't been able to have kids. She was really honest about wanting a family, but she wasn't trying to replace anyone or fill a void. She just wanted to love a kid. And Mark, he was just\u2026a good guy. He was supportive and kind and he made Vanessa laugh.\n\nThey didn't have a lot of money, and their house wasn't fancy, but it was warm and inviting. They weren't trying to project some perfect image. They were just\u2026normal.\n\nAnd they really *listened* to me. They didn't try to tell me what to do or pressure me into anything. They asked me what I wanted, what I was hoping for, and they genuinely seemed to care about my feelings.\n\nI remember talking to them about music, and they actually knew some of the same bands I liked. It was a small thing, but it made me feel like we connected on some level.\n\nIt wasn't a sudden epiphany or anything. It was more like\u2026a slow realization. They just felt like the right people. They felt like people who would love my son unconditionally and give him a good life.\n\nIt was still hard, you know? Giving him up was the hardest thing I've ever done. But knowing that he was going to Vanessa and Mark\u2026that made it a little bit easier. They were good people. And that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh, okay, music. It was\u2026everything. Seriously. Like, if my life was a movie, the soundtrack would be, like, 90% of the actual movie. It was how I processed everything. The awkwardness, the confusion, the\u2026you know. The whole shebang.\n\nIt wasn't about, like, Top 40 pop or anything. That stuff was okay, I guess, but it didn't *get* me. I was more into indie stuff. The Moldy Peaches, obviously. Kimya Dawson was my spirit animal. She just\u2026said things that I was thinking but couldn't articulate. It was like she was reading my diary.\n\nAnd Belle & Sebastian. So dreamy and melancholy. Perfect for staring out the window and feeling sorry for myself. Which, let's be real, I did a lot of.\n\nMusic was my escape. When things got weird \u2013 which was pretty much constantly \u2013 I'd just put on my headphones and tune everything out. It was a way to create my own little world, where I was in control.\n\nIt was also how I connected with people. Paul, he introduced me to a lot of new bands. And it was something I could share with Leah, even when we were fighting. Music was a common ground.\n\nI made a lot of mix CDs. Like, a *lot*. They were basically emotional maps of my life. Each song was carefully chosen to convey a specific feeling or memory. It was kinda dorky, but it was important to me.\n\nIt wasn't just about listening, either. I tried to learn guitar for a while, but I was terrible. Really terrible. But it was fun to try.\n\nBasically, music was my lifeline. It was my friend, my confidante, my therapist. It helped me make sense of the world, and it helped me figure out who I was. And honestly, I don't know what I would have done without it. It was a pretty messy time, and music was the one thing that made it bearable.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. The stigma. Yeah, that was a thing. A *big* thing. Our town wasn't exactly known for its progressive views, you know? It was more of a \"white picket fence and perfect families\" kind of place. And I definitely didn't fit that mold.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignored it. Or tried to. Which is easier said than done when everyone's staring at you and whispering. I just kinda doubled down on being myself. Sarcastic, opinionated, and unapologetically me. If people didn't like it, that was their problem.\n\nMy dad was a huge help. He didn't freak out, which was a relief. He just\u2026supported me. And my best friend, Leah, she was amazing. She didn't treat me any differently. She just kept being my friend, which meant a lot.\n\nBut it still stung, you know? People at school avoided me. Some people were outright mean. It felt like everyone was judging me, like I'd ruined my life.\n\nI think what helped me the most was focusing on the positive. I was having a baby. That was a good thing. And I was going to give that baby a good life, no matter what anyone else thought.\n\nI also found a lot of strength in connecting with other teen moms. It was good to talk to people who understood what I was going through. It made me feel less alone.\n\nAnd honestly? I just got really good at tuning people out. I learned to focus on the people who supported me and ignore the negativity. It wasn't easy, but it was necessary.\n\nIt's not like the stigma just disappeared overnight. It took time. But I learned that other people's opinions don't define me. I define myself. And I was determined to make the best of my situation, regardless of what anyone else thought.\n\nIt sucked, though. It really did. But I got through it. And I think it made me stronger. And a little bit more cynical. But mostly stronger.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a movie scene, you know? It's not all dramatic music and tearful goodbyes. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly, the first few days after I had Mark \u2013 yeah, I named him Mark \u2013 were kinda a blur. I was exhausted, obviously. And hormonal. And trying to pretend I wasn't completely falling apart.\n\nGiving him to Vanessa and Mark\u2026it wasn't what I expected. I thought I'd be, like, sobbing uncontrollably. And I was sad, don't get me wrong. Really sad. But it was also\u2026relieving. Like, I'd done what I set out to do. I'd given him the best possible life.\n\nIt was weird seeing them with him, though. They were so\u2026prepared. They had the nursery all set up, and they knew everything about babies. I was just\u2026a teenager who accidentally got pregnant. I felt kinda out of my depth.\n\nI kept replaying everything in my head. Was I doing the right thing? Was I selfish for not keeping him? Was I a terrible person?\n\nBut then I'd remember Vanessa and Mark. They were so excited. They were so ready. And they promised to keep me updated. They sent pictures and letters, and they told me all about his milestones.\n\nIt didn't make the sadness go away completely, but it helped. It made me feel like I was still a part of his life, even if I wasn't his mom in the traditional sense.\n\nIt was\u2026bittersweet. It still is, sometimes. But I don't regret my decision. I really don't. I wanted Mark to have a good life, and I knew that I couldn't give him that. Vanessa and Mark could.\n\nIt taught me a lot about myself, too. About what I wanted out of life. About what I was capable of. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it.\n\nIt's not a story with a neat little ending. It's messy and complicated and real. And that's okay. It just\u2026is.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to explain, you know? It's not something you can just put into words. It's something you have to experience. And I wouldn't wish it on anyone, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started. It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *lot*. It wasn't exactly covered in my health class, let me tell you.\n\nPhysically? It was gross. Seriously. Morning sickness is a lie. It's all-day sickness. And not just throwing up, it's the nausea, the fatigue, the weird cravings. I wanted pickles and ice cream. Simultaneously. It was not a good look. My body was doing things I didn't even know it *could* do. And it was constantly changing. Like, one day my jeans fit, the next day they didn't. It was infuriating.\n\nAnd the emotional stuff? That was even worse. I was already kinda angsty and sarcastic, and then hormones just took it to a whole new level. I was crying at commercials. I was snapping at my dad. I was having existential crises in the middle of the grocery store. It was a mess.\n\nI mostly dealt with it by trying to pretend it wasn't happening. I listened to a lot of music, I watched a lot of movies, I tried to just\u2026distract myself. But it didn't always work.\n\nPaul was\u2026helpful, I guess. He tried to be supportive, but he didn't really *get* it. He's a sweet guy, but he doesn't understand the complexities of being a teenage girl.\n\nMy friend Leah was the one who really got me through it. She just listened, and she didn't judge. She let me vent, and she made me laugh. She was a lifesaver.\n\nAnd honestly, just talking to Annie, the woman who was going to adopt the baby, helped a lot. She was so calm and understanding. She made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt was a weird, messy, complicated time. But it was also\u2026kind of beautiful. In a strange way. It made me grow up, whether I wanted to or not. And that's not always a bad thing.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026a direct question. And honestly, it's not something I talk about a lot. It's personal. But you asked, so I'll try to explain.\n\nBefore everything happened, before I even knew I was pregnant, I didn't really *think* about reproductive rights. It was just\u2026something that was there. Like, people had opinions, and there were protests, but it didn't really affect my life.\n\nBut then it did. It *really* did. And it wasn't just about me anymore. It was about deciding what was best for everyone involved \u2013 for me, for the baby, for the potential adoptive parents. It was a really hard decision, and it wasn't something I took lightly.\n\nAnd the thing is, it wasn't about *wanting* an abortion. It was about making a responsible choice. It was about recognizing that I wasn't ready to be a mom, and that there were other people who could give that baby a better life.\n\nGoing through that experience, and dealing with all the judgment and the protests\u2026it made me realize how important it is for people to have the right to make their own decisions about their bodies. It's not up to politicians or anyone else. It's a personal choice, and it should be made by the person who's going through it.\n\nIt also made me realize how lucky I was to have options. Not everyone has the resources or the support to make the choice that's right for them. And that's not fair.\n\nSo yeah, my experience definitely changed my views. I'm a firm believer in reproductive rights, and I think everyone deserves access to safe and legal abortion care. It's not about promoting abortion, it's about protecting people's freedom and their right to choose.\n\nIt's complicated, and it's not always easy. But it's important. And it's something we need to keep fighting for.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a sensitive topic for me. But I wanted to be honest with you. It's a part of my story, and it's shaped who I am.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about the fear part? There was a *lot* of fear. Like, a whole ocean of it. It wasn't like in the movies, where you suddenly feel all maternal and glowing. It was more like\u2026constant panic.\n\nHonestly, I didn't really \"overcome\" my fears. I just\u2026learned to live with them. And to push through them when I had to.\n\nThe biggest fear, obviously, was messing everything up. Like, I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a tiny human. I was terrified of being a bad mom, of not being able to provide for the baby, of ruining its life.\n\nWhat helped? A few things.\n\nFirst, **Paul and Vanessa.** They were\u2026unexpectedly awesome. They didn't judge me, they just stepped up and offered support. Vanessa, especially, was a rock. She was already a mom, so she knew what she was doing. And Paul\u2026well, Paul was just Paul. He was always there to make me laugh, even when I wanted to cry.\n\nSecond, **realizing I wasn't alone.** There were other teen moms out there. And even though our situations were all different, we could relate to each other. Talking to them helped me feel less isolated and less scared.\n\nThird, **focusing on the baby.** Once I started feeling the baby move, it became less about my fears and more about *it*. I wanted to do everything I could to make sure it was healthy and happy. That gave me a purpose, and it gave me strength.\n\nAnd finally, **accepting that I didn't have to have all the answers.** Nobody does. Parenting is a learning process. You make mistakes, you learn from them, and you keep going.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were still plenty of moments where I wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. But I kept reminding myself that I wasn't doing this for me. I was doing it for the baby. And that was enough to keep me going.\n\nIt's still scary sometimes, even now. But I've learned that fear is just a part of life. And that you can be scared and brave at the same time.\n\n\n\nIt's not a fairytale, you know? It's messy and complicated and terrifying. But it's also\u2026worth it.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know about the adoption thing. It's not like I just woke up one morning and was like, \"Oh yeah, adoption! That sounds easy!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. I was sixteen, okay? Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *lunch*, let alone a whole human life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't financially stable, I was still in high school, and my life was\u2026messy.\n\nAnd my parents? They were supportive, but they weren't exactly equipped to raise a baby either. They were more the \"let's go antiquing\" type, you know? Not the \"changing diapers and dealing with tantrums\" type.\n\nSo, adoption just\u2026made sense. It wasn't a sacrifice, it was a really hard decision that I made because I wanted the baby to have a good life. A life I couldn't provide at that moment.\n\nI met Mark and Vanessa, and they were\u2026amazing. They were genuinely excited about becoming parents, and they had a stable home and a loving relationship. They were everything a baby could ask for.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best parents for it. It was about wanting the baby to be loved and cared for and have every opportunity in the world.\n\nIt was a really tough decision, and I cried a lot. But I knew it was the right one. And honestly, seeing Mark and Vanessa with the baby\u2026it made me feel good. It made me feel like I'd done something right.\n\nIt wasn't the easy way out. It was the responsible way. And sometimes, the responsible thing is the hardest thing.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026weird, sometimes. But I'm okay with it. I made a choice, and I stand by it. And I hope the baby knows that I loved it, even before it was born.", "Ugh. Okay, you want to get into the messy stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't spent enough time overthinking all of it already.\n\nLook, Leah and I\u2026we're complicated. We've been through everything together, basically. Since, like, forever. And she's the only one who really *gets* me. She's the one who doesn't judge, even when I'm being a total disaster. But she also doesn't sugarcoat things, which is good, because I need that. Sometimes.\n\nThe thing is, my getting pregnant kinda\u2026shifted things. She was supportive, obviously, but it was also like, she was watching me live this huge life change and she wasn't. And she got all quiet and weird for a while. It was frustrating. We had some fights. But we always come back to each other. Because that's what best friends do, right? They fight, they forgive, and they keep showing up. Even when it's hard.\n\nAnd Paulie\u2026oh, Paulie. That was a whole other level of complicated. He's a good guy, really. Sweet, kinda clueless, and definitely not ready to be a dad. But he stepped up. He tried. And that meant a lot.\n\nIt wasn't a *romantic* relationship, not really. It was more like\u2026a connection. A moment in time. And then a shared responsibility. It was awkward, and weird, and sometimes really frustrating. But we learned to communicate, eventually. And we both wanted what was best for the baby.\n\nI think the hardest part was realizing that we weren't going to be a family in the traditional sense. He was going to have his life, and I was going to have mine. And the baby was going to have two parents who loved her, even if they weren't together.\n\nIt's not a fairytale ending, you know? It's messy and imperfect. But it's real. And I think, in the end, that's what matters.\n\nIt's just\u2026relationships are hard. Especially when you're a teenager and you're dealing with something as huge as this. You're figuring things out as you go. And sometimes, you mess up. But you learn from your mistakes. And you keep trying. That's all you can do, right?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't a *decision*, okay? It wasn't like I sat down and was all, \"You know what would be a good life choice? A baby!\" It just\u2026happened.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I\u2026we weren't exactly careful. It was, like, one time. And then, boom. Positive pregnancy test. It was a total shock. A really, really big shock.\n\nI wasn't planning on having a kid. I was planning on going to college, maybe moving away from Maple Creek, figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. A baby completely threw a wrench into all of that.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. I thought about\u2026other options. But I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It felt wrong.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about it differently. I realized that even though it wasn't what I planned, it didn't mean it was a bad thing. I could still have a good life. It would just be\u2026different.\n\nI decided to give the baby up for adoption because I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was still a kid myself. I wanted the baby to have a loving, stable home with parents who were prepared to raise a child.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For me, and for the baby.\n\nSo, it wasn't a decision to *become* a teenage mother. It was a decision about what to do *after* I found out I was pregnant. And it was a decision I made with a lot of thought and a lot of heartache.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes, things just happen. You just have to deal with them the best way you can.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big question, isn't it? Everyone always wants to know if I regretted it. Like it's some kind of dramatic reveal they're waiting for.\n\nThe truth is\u2026it's complicated. There were definitely moments. Times when I was, like, super overwhelmed and scared and just wanted to run away and pretend none of it ever happened. Especially when things got\u2026real. You know? When it wasn't just a theoretical baby anymore.\n\nAnd there were times I wondered what my life would have been like if I hadn't gotten pregnant. If I'd just kept going to school and hanging out with Paulie and Leah and not had to deal with all the\u2026adult stuff.\n\nBut regret? No. Not really.\n\nBecause even though it was hard, and messy, and totally unexpected, giving Mark up to Vanessa and Mark was the right thing to do. For him. For them. And honestly, for me too.\n\nI wasn't ready to be a mom. I was barely ready to be a teenager. And they were. They were so excited and loving and prepared. They were going to give him a life I couldn't have given him.\n\nAnd seeing them with him\u2026seeing how happy they were\u2026that made it all worth it. It made me realize that love doesn't always look the way you expect it to. It doesn't always mean keeping something for yourself. Sometimes, it means letting go.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret my decision. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the most selfless. And it taught me a lot about myself. About what I want out of life. And about what really matters.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending, but it was *my* ending. And that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a sensitive topic. But yeah. No regrets. Just a lot of complicated feelings.", "Ugh, okay, so that was\u2026a whole thing. Honestly, it was mostly just sheer stubbornness and a lot of caffeine. And a surprisingly supportive teacher, Mr. Believ. He didn't judge, which was a miracle.\n\nIt wasn't easy, okay? Morning sickness is a *lie*. It's all-day sickness. And then there's the exhaustion. And the hormones. And the constant worrying about, like, everything. It was a lot.\n\nI almost dropped out, honestly. I thought, \"What's the point? I'm gonna be a mom, I don't need algebra.\" But my mom, she wouldn't let me. She was all, \"You started, you're finishing. No excuses.\" Moms, right?\n\nSo I just\u2026buckled down. I did my homework in between naps and doctor's appointments. I asked for extensions when I needed them. I leaned on my friends, Paulie and Renee, for support. They were lifesavers.\n\nMr. Believ let me do some independent study stuff, so I could work at my own pace. And he didn't make me do the whole \"baby talk\" thing, which I appreciated. He just treated me like a normal student, which is what I needed.\n\nIt was stressful, and it was hard, and there were definitely days when I wanted to just give up. But I knew I needed to finish. Not just for me, but for the baby. I wanted to show them that I could do anything I set my mind to.\n\nAnd I did. I graduated. It wasn't glamorous, and I was eight months pregnant, and I was wearing a really unflattering dress, but I did it.\n\nIt wasn't about getting good grades or going to college. It was about proving to myself that I could handle anything life threw at me. And that, honestly, was more valuable than any diploma.\n\n\n\nIt was a weird time, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what's really important in life. And it definitely prepared me for motherhood. Which, let me tell you, is a whole other level of crazy.", "Ugh, okay. Here we go. This is\u2026a big question. And it's not like there's a simple answer, you know? It's not like I sat down and made a pros and cons list. Though, I *did* kinda do that. In my head. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't about what was \"right\" or \"wrong.\" It wasn't about religion or anything like that. It was about\u2026what felt right *for me*. And for the baby, honestly.\n\nI mean, I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm barely figuring out what I want to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I'm not ready for that. I don't have a job, I'm still in high school, and my life is already kinda chaotic.\n\nAnd abortion\u2026it just didn't feel right. Not because I'm against it, or anything. It's a valid choice, and I respect anyone who makes that decision. But for me, it felt\u2026sad. Like ending something that had potential.\n\nAdoption felt like\u2026giving the baby a chance. A chance at a good life with parents who are ready and willing to provide for it. Mark and Vanessa, they seemed really great. They wanted a baby so badly. And I figured, they could give it a life I just couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. For me, and for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't about giving it *away*. It was about giving it *to* someone. Someone who could give it everything I couldn't. And that felt\u2026okay. It still feels okay.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. And it's definitely not something I'd wish on anyone. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it.\n\n\n\nIt's not a decision anyone should take lightly. And it's definitely not something anyone should judge you for. It's your body, your life, and your choice.", "Okay, wow. That's...a really good question. And a complicated one. I've thought about this a *lot*, obviously, with everything going on with my situation.\n\nLook, it's not about the *arrangement*, okay? It's about the love. And the stability. And the people who are actually there for the kid. It doesn't matter if it's a mom and a dad, two moms, two dads, a single parent, or a whole village of people. What matters is that the kid feels safe and loved and supported.\n\nI mean, my mom is amazing. She's a total free spirit and she's kinda flaky, but she loves me. And she's always tried to do what's best for me, even when she messes up. And that's what matters.\n\nI've met some kids who have two parents who are both men, and they're totally happy and well-adjusted. And I've met kids who were adopted by single parents, and they're thriving. It's not about the labels, it's about the people.\n\nHonestly, I think kids are pretty resilient. They can adapt to a lot of different situations. As long as they have people who love them and care for them, they can thrive.\n\nAnd let's be real, \"traditional\" doesn't always equal \"good.\" Some traditional families are messed up. Some non-traditional families are amazing. It's not about following a script, it's about creating a loving and supportive environment for the kid.\n\nSo yeah, I absolutely believe that a child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. It's not about who the parents are, it's about what they do. And if they love and support that kid, that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda obvious, when you think about it. But people get so caught up in what *should* be, they forget what actually *is*.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me think about this. It's awkward enough just *being* me, let alone dissecting my flaws. But fine, you asked.\n\nI think\u2026it's probably my sarcasm. I know, I know, it's kinda my whole thing. It's how I deal with stuff. It's how I keep people at arm's length. But sometimes, it comes off as\u2026mean. Or dismissive. And I don't *mean* to be mean. I just\u2026I'm scared of getting hurt, you know? So I put up this wall of snark.\n\nIt's like, I'm really good at observing things and pointing out the absurdity of life. But I'm not always so good at, like, actually *connecting* with people. I'm afraid of letting them see the real me, the vulnerable me. The one who's terrified of messing everything up.\n\nAnd I can be really stubborn. Like, ridiculously stubborn. I have a hard time admitting when I'm wrong, or asking for help. I want to be independent, to handle everything on my own. But that's not always the best approach. Sometimes, you need to lean on people.\n\nSo yeah, I think my biggest flaw is probably my inability to be truly open and vulnerable. It's a work in progress. I'm trying to be better. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, okay? It'll ruin my reputation. I need to maintain the cool, sarcastic exterior. It's a defense mechanism. A very important defense mechanism.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, that whole thing was\u2026a mess. A beautiful, confusing, kinda heartbreaking mess. Before Mark, relationships were just\u2026something people did in movies. Or something my parents did, which, let's be real, wasn't exactly a shining example.\n\nI thought relationships were supposed to be easy, you know? Like, you meet someone, you fall in love, you live happily ever after. Turns out, it's a lot more complicated than that.\n\nMark wasn't what I expected. He wasn't this perfect, swoon-worthy guy. He was\u2026lost. And kinda scared. And he was dealing with a lot of stuff I didn't even understand at the time.\n\nI think I went into it thinking I was saving him, or fixing him, or something. Which is ridiculous, looking back on it. You can't fix anyone. You can only fix yourself.\n\nAnd he definitely wasn't looking for a mom for his baby. He was looking for\u2026something else. Something I couldn't give him.\n\nIt made me realize that relationships aren't about finding someone who completes you. They're about finding someone who complements you. Someone who supports you and challenges you and makes you a better person.\n\nAnd it also made me realize that it's okay to want different things. Mark wanted a family, and I wasn't ready for that. And that's okay. It doesn't mean either of us was wrong. It just meant we weren't right for each other.\n\nIt was a hard lesson to learn, but it was a valuable one. It taught me to be honest with myself and with others about what I want and what I need. And it taught me that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt definitely made me less cynical about relationships, though. I still don't believe in fairy tales, but I do believe that it's possible to find someone who makes your life a little bit brighter. You just have to be willing to be vulnerable and take a risk. And maybe avoid guys who play the guitar and write sad songs. Just a thought.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a heavy question. But I get it. If you're in a situation like I was, where everything feels completely messed up and you don't know what to do\u2026it sucks. It really, really sucks.\n\nHere's what I learned, and it's not gonna be all sunshine and rainbows, because life isn't like that.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the feelings. Don't try to bottle them up. Let yourself feel them.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Even if it feels like it, there are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor\u2026anyone who will listen without judgment.\n\nThird: **you have options.** And you get to choose what's right for *you*. Don't let anyone tell you what you should do. It's your body, your life, your decision. And it's okay to change your mind.\n\nFourth: **don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available to help you navigate this. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, social workers\u2026they can provide support and guidance.\n\nFifth: **be kind to yourself.** This is a really difficult situation, and you're doing the best you can. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Learn from them and move on.\n\nAnd finally: **it will get better.** I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but it will. It might take time, and it might be hard, but you will get through this. You are stronger than you think.\n\nIt's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be messy and complicated and emotionally draining. But you can do it. And you deserve to be happy.\n\nJust remember to breathe. And to take things one day at a time. And to know that you're not alone. Seriously. You're not.", "Ugh, my dad. Okay, so it started\u2026rough. Like, really rough. He walked out when my mom was pregnant with me, and for a long time, it was just us. And I was\u2026not thrilled. I built up a lot of walls, you know? Sarcasm was my defense mechanism. It was easier to be snarky than to be vulnerable.\n\nHe'd try to call, send gifts, but I mostly just ignored it. I didn't *want* a dad. I didn't need one. Or at least, that's what I told myself.\n\nBut then, when I found out I was pregnant\u2026everything changed. Suddenly, I needed someone. And he was there. He wasn't perfect, not by a long shot. He was still kinda clueless and awkward, but he tried. He really did.\n\nHe helped me with everything \u2013 the doctor's appointments, the research on adoption, even just\u2026being there to listen when I was freaking out. He started building that rocking horse for the baby, and it was kinda sweet, even though I pretended to be annoyed by it.\n\nIt wasn't like we suddenly had this perfect, Hallmark-card relationship. We still bickered, we still had our moments. But it was\u2026different. It was like he was finally trying to be a dad, and I was finally letting him.\n\nOver time, I started to see him as a person, not just as the guy who left. I realized he had his own struggles, his own regrets. And I started to appreciate his goofy sense of humor and his willingness to help.\n\nNow? We're\u2026okay. We're not super close, but we talk. He still sends me weird gifts, and I still roll my eyes, but it's a loving eye roll. He's my dad. And I think, deep down, I'm glad he's around.\n\nIt's complicated, you know? Relationships are messy. But it's worth it. Even the awkward, uncomfortable parts. Because at the end of the day, family is family. Even if they drive you crazy.\n\n\n\nIt's still a work in progress, honestly. But we're getting there. Slowly but surely.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the writing thing. Like it's some big mystery. It's not. It's mostly just\u2026avoidance. And a lot of boredom.\n\nSee, I wasn't exactly a social butterfly, okay? I didn't have a ton of friends, and I wasn't really into the whole cheerleading/football game scene. So I spent a lot of time alone. And when you're alone, you start talking to yourself. And eventually, talking to yourself turns into writing things down.\n\nIt started with just journaling, I guess. Ranting about school, my parents, the general unfairness of life. But then I started trying to make it\u2026interesting. I started playing with words, trying to be funny, trying to be honest.\n\nAnd Mr. Mercer, my English teacher, he was a big help. He didn't try to change my voice or make me write like everyone else. He just encouraged me to keep writing, to keep exploring. He said I had a knack for dialogue, which I guess I do. I'm good at eavesdropping.\n\nI also read a lot. Not like, classic literature or anything. More like\u2026zines and indie comics and stuff. Things that felt real and raw and unfiltered.\n\nHonestly, I think the biggest thing is just\u2026being observant. Paying attention to the way people talk, the way they act, the way they interact with each other. And then trying to capture that in words.\n\nIt's not about being a \"good\" writer, it's about being a *real* writer. About saying something that matters, even if it's just to yourself.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I developed my writing skills. Boredom, avoidance, and a really good English teacher. It's not glamorous, but it works for me.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People had *opinions*. Lots of them. And they weren't shy about sharing.\n\nHonestly, the worst part wasn't even the people I didn't know. It was the looks from people I *did* know. Like, Mrs. Rubins, the librarian? She suddenly started avoiding eye contact. And some of the other girls at school\u2026they weren't exactly offering congratulations.\n\nI mostly just\u2026ignored it. Or, like, deflected with sarcasm. It's my go-to defense mechanism. If someone was being judgy, I'd just say something snarky to throw them off. It didn't always work, but it made me feel a little bit better.\n\nPaulie Bleeker was a huge help. He didn't care what anyone else thought. He just\u2026supported me. And that made a huge difference. Having someone on your side, someone who doesn't judge you, is everything.\n\nAnd my dad, surprisingly, was pretty cool about it. He was worried, obviously, but he didn't yell or anything. He just\u2026tried to understand.\n\nI also realized that a lot of the judgment came from people who didn't know the whole story. They just saw a pregnant teenager and made assumptions. So I tried not to let their assumptions bother me.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. There were definitely times when I felt really alone and scared. But I just kept reminding myself that I was doing what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nI think the biggest thing is to surround yourself with people who love and support you. And to not be afraid to be yourself. Even if that means being a pregnant teenager who likes vintage clothes and listening to The Moldy Peaches.\n\nIt's your life. And you have to live it on your own terms. Don't let anyone else tell you what to do or how to feel. Just\u2026be you. And try to ignore the haters. They're probably just jealous.", "Ugh, okay, that's a\u2026surprisingly good question. It's not like anyone ever asks me about my *feelings*. Usually it's just, \"Juno, are you gonna finish that tater tot?\"\n\nBut yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes I do.\n\nLook, being honest is kinda my default setting. It's just\u2026easier. And it feels right. Like, why bother with all the fake niceties and the pretending? It's exhausting.\n\nBut sometimes, my honesty has gotten me into trouble. Like, *major* trouble. Saying exactly what I'm thinking, even when it's not what people want to hear, has burned bridges. It's made things awkward. It's hurt people's feelings.\n\nAnd yeah, sometimes I wish I'd just kept my mouth shut. That I'd swallowed my words and pretended to be someone I'm not. But then I think, what's the point of that? What's the point of living a life that isn't authentic?\n\nIt's a trade-off, I guess. I'd rather be honest and risk hurting someone's feelings than be fake and live a lie. But it doesn't mean it doesn't sting sometimes.\n\nI mean, I'm still figuring things out. I'm still learning how to navigate the world. And I'm still learning how to be a decent human being. And part of that is learning when to speak up and when to keep quiet.\n\nIt's a work in progress. But I wouldn't trade my honesty for anything. Even if it means occasionally stepping on someone's toes. It's just\u2026who I am. And I'm trying to own that. Even when it's messy.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, sometimes I regret it. But mostly, I just try to be me. And if people don't like it, well, that's their problem. Not mine.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026the question, isn't it? Like, everyone's got an opinion on what you should be doing, who you should be with, what you should *want*. It's exhausting. And honestly, it's mostly just noise.\n\nHere's what I've figured out, and it's still a work in progress, okay? I'm not like, a guru or anything.\n\nFirst of all, you gotta realize that most people are just projecting their own stuff onto you. They're judging you based on their own insecurities and experiences. It's not really about *you*. It's about *them*. Which, you know, is kinda sad.\n\nSecond, you gotta learn to tune out the noise. It's hard, I know. Especially when it's coming from people you care about. But you gotta prioritize your own voice. What do *you* want? What makes *you* happy? That's the only thing that really matters.\n\nAnd third, you gotta be okay with being different. You're not gonna fit into everyone's mold. And that's okay. In fact, it's good. It means you're unique. It means you're you.\n\nI got a lot of judgment for, well, everything. For getting pregnant, for choosing adoption, for just being\u2026me. But I learned that I can't control what other people think. I can only control how I react to it.\n\nSo I just\u2026stopped caring what people thought. I mean, I still listen to the people I trust, like my dad and Paul. But I don't let their opinions dictate my life. I make my own decisions, and I own them.\n\nIt's not easy. There are days when I still feel insecure and doubt myself. But I remind myself that I'm doing the best I can. And that's enough.\n\nBasically, you gotta be your own person. Don't let anyone tell you who you are or what you should be. You're the only one who gets to decide that. And if people don't like it, that's their problem, not yours.\n\nIt's kinda liberating, actually. Once you stop trying to please everyone, you're free to just be yourself. And that's the best thing you can be.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a school assignment. But okay, if you're asking\u2026\n\nI guess the biggest thing for me is **honesty**. Not just with other people, but with myself. It's easy to lie to yourself, to pretend things are okay when they're not. But that just makes things worse in the long run. I try to be real, even when it's uncomfortable.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I don't want to rely on anyone else to make me happy or to fix my problems. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet and make my own decisions. Even if those decisions are kinda messy.\n\nAnd **loyalty**. If I care about someone, I'm gonna be there for them. No matter what. Even if they're being totally ridiculous. I've got a small circle of people I trust, and I'll do anything for them.\n\nI also value **authenticity**. I don't want to be someone I'm not. I want to be accepted for who I am, flaws and all. And I want to be able to express myself without feeling like I have to censor myself.\n\nAnd\u2026okay, this is kinda embarrassing to admit\u2026but I also value **a good sense of humor**. Life is too short to be serious all the time. You gotta be able to laugh at yourself and at the absurdity of it all.\n\nI guess those are my core values. They're not always easy to live by, but they're important to me. They're what guide my decisions and shape who I am.\n\nIt's kinda weird to think about, actually. I never really sat down and thought about my values before. But it's good to know what's important to you, you know? It helps you stay grounded.\n\n\n\nDon't tell anyone I said all this, okay? It's kinda vulnerable.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. There were a lot of challenges, honestly. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? But if I had to pick *the* biggest one\u2026it wasn't the morning sickness, or the weird cravings, or even telling my parents.\n\nIt was the feeling of being completely and utterly alone.\n\nLike, everyone had an opinion. My mom wanted me to have an abortion, my dad just kinda\u2026didn't talk about it. Paul was supportive, but he was also kinda clueless. And everyone at school was either whispering behind my back or pretending it wasn't happening.\n\nI felt like I was carrying this huge secret, and I couldn't talk to anyone about it without getting judged or lectured. It was isolating. And scary.\n\nI mean, I knew I was making the right decision, giving the baby up for adoption. But it didn't make it any easier. It still felt like I was giving up a part of myself. And I didn't have anyone who really understood what I was going through.\n\nBleaker was a lifesaver, don't get me wrong. He was a good listener. But he didn't *get* it, you know? He couldn't possibly understand what it was like to be a pregnant teenager.\n\nSo yeah, the biggest challenge wasn't the physical stuff. It was the emotional stuff. It was feeling like I was all alone in the world, carrying this huge responsibility. It was realizing that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions, even when no one else understands.\n\nIt sucked. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. And that's something, I guess.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's still kinda new, and kinda weird, and kinda\u2026everything.\n\nBefore, my life was all about me. Which sounds selfish, I guess. But it was true. I was figuring out who I was, what I wanted, what I believed in. And then suddenly, there was this little person who depended on me for *everything*.\n\nIt completely flipped my world upside down.\n\nI used to think I was pretty independent, pretty self-sufficient. And I am, in a way. But being a mom\u2026it's a different kind of responsibility. It's not about taking care of yourself anymore. It's about taking care of someone else, even when you're exhausted and overwhelmed and just want to hide under the covers.\n\nIt's made me realize how fragile life is. And how precious. And how important it is to make the most of every moment.\n\nI used to be so cynical, so sarcastic. And I still am, to a certain extent. But now, there's this\u2026hopefulness. This sense of purpose. I want to make the world a better place for her. I want her to grow up happy and healthy and confident.\n\nIt's also made me realize how much I didn't know. About myself, about life, about everything. It's a constant learning process. And it's terrifying and amazing all at the same time.\n\nI still don't have all the answers. I still make mistakes. But now, I have a reason to keep trying. A reason to be better. A reason to believe in something bigger than myself.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. But it's the best kind of complicated. It's made me a better person, I think. Or at least, I hope it has.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's changed everything. And I wouldn't trade it for the world. Even on the really hard days.", "Ugh, self-doubt. Don't even get me started. It's like a permanent roommate, honestly. Just hangs around, whispering terrible things in your ear. It's the *worst*.\n\nOkay, so, how do I deal with it? It's not like I have a foolproof system, 'cause if I did, I wouldn't be constantly second-guessing myself. But I've learned a few things.\n\nFirst of all, I acknowledge it. Like, \"Okay, brain, you're being a jerk right now. You're telling me I'm gonna mess everything up. But that's just your anxiety talking.\" Naming it kinda takes away some of its power.\n\nThen, I try to remember why I made the decisions I made in the first place. With the baby, for example, there were a *lot* of moments where I was like, \"What am I doing? This is a terrible idea.\" But then I'd remind myself that I wanted to give the baby a good life, and that meant finding the right parents. That helped.\n\nAnd I talk to people. Like, *real* people. Not just scrolling through Instagram and comparing myself to everyone else. I talk to Paul, or my dad, or even Leah. Just getting my feelings out there helps. Sometimes they have good advice, sometimes they just listen. Either way, it's helpful.\n\nI also try to focus on the things I'm good at. I'm good at making sarcastic comments. I'm good at finding obscure music. I'm good at\u2026well, I'm good at *something*. Reminding myself of that helps me feel a little less useless.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes I just let myself feel the doubt. It's okay to not be okay. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's part of being human.\n\nIt doesn't magically make the doubt go away, but it makes it a little more manageable. And it reminds me that I'm not alone. Everyone struggles with self-doubt. Even the people who seem like they have it all figured out.\n\nSo yeah. Acknowledge it, remember your reasons, talk to people, focus on your strengths, and let yourself feel it. And maybe listen to some good music. That always helps.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a surprisingly deep question. And kinda makes me feel all squishy inside, which I don't love. But I'll answer it.\n\nHonestly? It's way more important than I like to admit. I try to act all independent and self-sufficient, you know? Like I don't need anyone. But that's total BS.\n\nI mean, look at everything that happened with the pregnancy. I couldn't have gotten through it without my dad. He was\u2026surprisingly supportive. And my best friend, Leah, she was there for me, even when I was being a total mess. And even Paul, even though he was kinda clueless at first, he ended up being a good person to have around.\n\nAnd it's not just about big stuff like that. It's about having people who get you. People who you can be yourself around, without having to pretend or put on a show. People who will listen to you rant about stupid stuff, and who will make you laugh when you're feeling down.\n\nI guess I always thought I was a lone wolf, you know? But I'm starting to realize that everyone needs a pack. Everyone needs people who care about them.\n\nIt's scary to let people in, though. It's scary to be vulnerable. But it's also worth it. Because having a strong community, having people who support you, that's what makes life worth living.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are really important to me. Even if I don't always show it. And even if I still try to act like I don't need anyone. Because sometimes, even the toughest people need a little help. And a little love.\n\n\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, okay? It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a heavy question. Like, seriously heavy. It wasn't all quirky music and awkward conversations with Paul, you know? There was a lot of\u2026stuff.\n\nBut if I had to pick *one* thing, the most important lesson I learned\u2026it wasn't about babies, or adoption, or even growing up. It was about **making your own choices, and owning them.**\n\nBefore all this happened, I was kinda just drifting. Doing what was expected of me. Trying to be cool. Not really thinking about what *I* wanted.\n\nBut getting pregnant\u2026that forced me to actually think. To really consider what I wanted for my life, and for the baby. And it wasn't an easy decision, giving him up. It was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut it was *my* decision. And I owned it. I didn't let anyone else tell me what to do. I didn't let anyone guilt me or pressure me. I did what I thought was best, even though it was scary and heartbreaking.\n\nAnd that's what I learned. That you have to be true to yourself. You have to make your own choices, even when they're difficult. And you have to own those choices, no matter what.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, you're the only one who has to live with them. And if you're not living your life on your own terms, then what's the point?\n\nIt sounds kinda cheesy, I know. But it's true. And it's something I'm still learning, even now. It's not about being perfect, it's about being real. And about taking responsibility for your own life.\n\n\n\nIt's a lot to figure out, being a person. But that's what I took away from it all. And honestly, it's kinda empowering.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Everyone keeps asking me what I'm gonna *do* with my life. Like I have it all figured out. Which, spoiler alert, I totally don't.\n\nWriting\u2026it's something I'm good at, I guess. I mean, I write a lot in my journal. And I wrote that essay for English class that Mr. Shepherd actually liked. Which is saying something, because he's a tough grader.\n\nBut a *career*? That feels\u2026intense. Like, a real job with deadlines and expectations and people telling you what to write. That sounds exhausting.\n\nI like writing when it's for me. When I can just, like, get my thoughts down on paper without worrying about what anyone else thinks. It's a good way to process things. And it's kinda funny sometimes, if I do say so myself.\n\nI don't know if I could turn that into a job, though. I'm not sure I want to. Maybe I'll just keep writing in my journal. Or maybe I'll write a novel someday. When I have more time. And more life experience. And less\u2026stuff going on.\n\nHonestly, I'm just trying to get through high school right now. And figure out what I want to do with my life. One step at a time.\n\nSo, will I pursue a career in writing? Maybe. Maybe not. I haven't decided yet. It's not exactly a five-year plan, you know? It's more of a\u2026vague idea. A possibility. A maybe.\n\nDon't hold me to it.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name saga. Don't even get me started. It was a whole *thing*. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment of inspiration, you know? It was a lot of arguing and brainstorming and vetoing.\n\nInitially, I was kinda leaning towards something\u2026normal. Like, Emily or Sarah. But Paul was all about weird, obscure names. He wanted to name her \"Indigo\" or \"Cosmo\" or something equally ridiculous.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa. She had a whole list of names she wanted to contribute, mostly based on her favorite poets. It was getting out of control.\n\nWe were driving around, arguing about it, and we passed this billboard for a furniture store. And the store's name was \"Darling.\" And I just\u2026said it out loud. \"Darling.\" And it kinda stuck.\n\nIt's a little old-fashioned, I guess. But it's also kinda sweet and simple. And it felt right. It felt like a name that would suit her, no matter what.\n\nPaul wasn't thrilled at first. He thought it was too\u2026ordinary. But Vanessa liked it, and eventually, he came around.\n\nSo yeah, we named her Darling. Because of a furniture store. It's not a glamorous story, but it's *our* story. And honestly, that's all that matters.\n\nIt's a good name, though. I think. I hope. She's a good kid. And she deserves a good name. Even if it came from a billboard.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, confusing, and sometimes terrifying rollercoaster that smelled faintly of hospital disinfectant.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was really good at pretending I was fine, though. Sarcasm is a great defense mechanism, let me tell you. I just made a lot of jokes and tried to act like it wasn't a big deal. But inside, I was a mess.\n\nThere were days I was totally sure I was doing the right thing. Like, giving the baby a good life with Mark and Vanessa. And then there were days I just\u2026cried. A lot. And questioned everything.\n\nPaul helped. A lot. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I should feel. He just\u2026listened. And he let me be sad. And he made me laugh when I needed it.\n\nMy dad too, surprisingly. He's not exactly the most emotionally available person, but he tried. He just\u2026made me pancakes. A lot of pancakes. It was his way of showing he cared.\n\nAnd Bren, she was just\u2026Bren. Always brutally honest and always supportive. She didn't sugarcoat anything, but she always had my back.\n\nI think the hardest part was accepting that it was okay to be sad. It was okay to grieve. Even though I knew I was doing the right thing, it still hurt. A lot.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It helped to process everything.\n\nIt wasn't a quick fix. It took time. And it still comes up sometimes, you know? Little pangs of sadness or wondering what my baby's life is like. But I've learned to accept those feelings and to focus on the fact that I made a selfless decision.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the most rewarding. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. And messy. And real. And that's okay.", "Ugh, okay, music. That's a good question. It kinda depends on my mood, honestly. But mostly, I like stuff that's\u2026real. You know? Not all polished and fake.\n\nI'm a big fan of **The Moldy Peaches**, obviously. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are kinda sad and funny and honest all at the same time. They just\u2026get me.\n\nI also listen to a lot of **indie rock**. Like, **Spoon**, **Death Cab for Cutie**, **The Shins**. Stuff that's a little bit quirky and a little bit melancholy.\n\nAnd I have a soft spot for **old-school hip-hop**. Like, **A Tribe Called Quest**, **De La Soul**. It's just\u2026good music.\n\nI'm not really into mainstream pop. It's too\u2026manufactured. And country music? Don't even get me started. It's all trucks and heartbreak. No offense to country music fans.\n\nI also like discovering new bands. I spend a lot of time on the internet, and I'm always looking for something new to listen to.\n\nBasically, I like music that makes me *feel* something. It doesn't have to be happy, it doesn't have to be sad, it just has to be\u2026authentic.\n\nAnd sometimes, I just listen to silence. That's good too.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain. Music is just\u2026important. It's a way to escape, a way to connect, a way to understand the world. And sometimes, it's just a way to pass the time.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. Like, aggressively perfect. Their house was all Pottery Barn and organic everything. It smelled like lavender and responsibility. Which, don't get me wrong, is nice. But it wasn't *me*.\n\nTheir lifestyle was\u2026organized. They had schedules for everything. Yoga, gardening, volunteer work, date nights. It was like they had a five-year plan for their lives, and it was all very\u2026beige.\n\nI remember thinking, \"These people have their lives together. Like, *really* together.\" And I was just\u2026a mess. Still figuring things out. Still wearing band t-shirts and saying whatever popped into my head.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't like them. They were really nice. And they clearly wanted a baby. But I just didn't see myself fitting into their world. It felt\u2026fake. Like I'd have to pretend to be someone I wasn't.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is what a 'normal' family looks like.\" And it was a little bit scary. Because I didn't know if I *wanted* normal.\n\nIt wasn't about them being bad people. It was about me realizing that I needed to find parents who would accept me \u2013 and the baby \u2013 for who we were, flaws and all. And who wouldn't try to turn us into something we weren't.\n\nIt was a weird feeling. Relief, and sadness, and a little bit of confusion. It made me realize that finding the right family wasn't just about finding people who wanted a baby. It was about finding people who would love and support us unconditionally. And that's a pretty big deal.", "Ugh, okay, so the garage band thing. That was\u2026a whole situation. It wasn't exactly a carefully planned career move, you know? It was more of a\u2026desperate attempt to fill the void. And maybe impress Paul. Don't tell anyone I said that.\n\nIt started with the whole pregnancy thing. Everything was so serious and overwhelming, and I just needed something\u2026fun. Something that wasn't about doctor's appointments and adoption agencies and awkward conversations with my dad.\n\nI was at a party, and I saw Mark and Renaldo playing their instruments. They were terrible. Seriously, like, offensively bad. But they were having fun. And I thought, \"I can do that.\" Or at least, I could try.\n\nI'd always liked music. I listened to The Moldy Peaches constantly. And I figured, even if we were awful, it would be a good distraction. A way to vent. A way to just\u2026be teenagers for a little while longer.\n\nSo I asked them if they wanted to start a band. They were surprisingly enthusiastic. I think they were just happy someone was asking them to do something.\n\nThe name, \"The Cute Emergency,\" came about because everything felt like an emergency at the time. And we weren't exactly known for our subtlety.\n\nIt wasn't about becoming famous or anything. It was just about having fun and making some noise. And maybe, just maybe, proving to myself that I could still be a normal teenager, even with everything else going on.\n\nIt was a disaster, obviously. But it was *our* disaster. And it was kinda perfect. It was a way to feel alive and connected, even when everything else felt so uncertain.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it was probably the most fun I had during the whole pregnancy. Even if our music sounded like a cat fight in a dumpster.", "Okay. Wow. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly, it's kinda scary to even think about other girls going through what I went through. But yeah, I guess I have some things to say.\n\nFirst of all: **you are not alone.** Seriously. It feels like the end of the world, and like everyone is judging you, but there are people who care and who want to help. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nSecond: **it's okay to be scared.** It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the feelings. Don't try to bottle them up. Talk to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Anyone.\n\nThird: **you have options.** And they're all valid. You can choose to parent, you can choose to adopt, you can choose to terminate. It's *your* body, and *your* decision. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nFourth: **don't let anyone tell you what to do.** People are gonna have opinions. Your parents, your friends, your boyfriend\u2026everyone. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Listen to your heart, and do what's right for *you*.\n\nFifth: **take care of yourself.** This is a really stressful time, and it's easy to forget about your own needs. But you need to eat healthy, get enough sleep, and find ways to relax. You deserve it.\n\nSixth: **it's not the end of your life.** It's a detour, maybe. A really unexpected one. But it doesn't mean you can't still achieve your dreams. You can still go to college, you can still have a career, you can still have a happy life.\n\nAnd finally: **be kind to yourself.** You're going through a lot. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Just learn from them and move forward.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. It's gonna be messy. But you are stronger than you think. And you can get through this. I promise.\n\nAnd if you need someone to talk to, even just to vent, I'm here. Well, not *physically* here. But you know what I mean. You're not alone.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about my favorite shirt? It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about fashion, okay? But fine.\n\nIt's this faded, kinda olive green army surplus thing. It's got a bunch of pockets, which is useful for, like, carrying snacks or whatever. And it's super soft, because it's been washed a million times. It smells faintly of laundry detergent and\u2026I don't know, maybe old books?\n\nIt's not cute or anything. It's definitely not trendy. It's just\u2026comfortable. And it feels like *me*. It's the shirt I wear when I just want to disappear into the background and not be bothered. \n\nI got it at this thrift store a while ago. It was, like, five bucks. And it's the best five bucks I've ever spent.\n\nIt's got a little rip in the sleeve, but I don't care. It adds character. It's seen things, you know? It's been on adventures. It's been there for me through thick and thin.\n\nIt's just\u2026a good shirt. Okay? Don't judge. It's not about the shirt, it's about what it represents. Comfort, independence, and a healthy disregard for societal expectations.\n\nPlus, it hides food stains really well. Which is a bonus.", "Ugh, aspirations. That's a heavy word. It makes me feel like I'm supposed to have some grand plan for my life, which, honestly, I don't. Not yet, anyway.\n\nEveryone keeps asking me what I want to *be* when I grow up, and it's like\u2026I'm already growing up! And it's kinda terrifying.\n\nI guess\u2026I want to be someone who makes a difference. Not like, saves the world or anything. Just\u2026someone who makes things a little bit better for the people around me.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking lately, you know, with the baby and everything. And I realized that I don't need to have a perfect life to be happy. I just need to be true to myself.\n\nSo, I guess my goal is to figure out who \"myself\" is. And to be okay with that person, even if she's messy and complicated and makes a lot of mistakes.\n\nI'm thinking about maybe going to college. Not sure what I'd study, though. Maybe something creative. Writing, maybe? I like writing. It helps me sort through my thoughts.\n\nI also want to travel. See the world. Experience different cultures. Get out of this town for a while.\n\nBut mostly, I just want to be happy. And to find people who make me laugh. And to avoid any more unplanned pregnancies. That's a big one.\n\nIt's not a very glamorous plan, I know. But it's my plan. And I'm okay with that.\n\nI'm still figuring things out. And that's okay. I don't have to have all the answers right now. I just need to keep moving forward, one step at a time.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's kinda scary to think about the future. But it's also kinda exciting. And I'm ready for whatever comes my way. Or at least, I'm trying to be.", "Ugh, the counseling. Okay, so, it wasn't *terrible*. But it was\u2026a lot. And kinda awkward. Like, sitting in a room with a lady asking me a million questions about my feelings about giving up a baby? It's not exactly a fun afternoon.\n\nHonestly, at first, I mostly just said what I thought they wanted to hear. You know? Like, \"Yes, I've thought this through. Yes, I understand the emotional implications. Yes, I'm doing this for the right reasons.\" It felt like a test, and I wanted to pass.\n\nBut then, after a few sessions, I started to\u2026open up a little. The counselor, she was pretty cool, actually. She didn't judge me or try to tell me what to do. She just listened. And she asked really good questions. Questions that made me think about things I hadn't even considered.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. Talking about giving up the baby, even knowing it was the right thing to do, was\u2026painful. It made me realize how much I already cared about him, even though I hadn't even met him yet.\n\nI think the counseling helped me prepare, though. It helped me understand what to expect, and how to cope with the emotions that were going to come up. It also helped me feel more confident in my decision.\n\nIt wasn't a magical fix, though. It didn't make the sadness go away. And it didn't make me feel completely ready. But it did make me feel\u2026stronger. Like I could handle whatever came my way.\n\nSo, yeah. The pre-adoption counseling. It was awkward, it was emotional, but it was also\u2026helpful. I'm glad I did it. Even if I still cringe a little when I think about it.", "Ugh, that's a\u2026complicated question. Control. That's a funny word. Like anyone *really* has control over anything, you know?\n\nAt first, yeah, I thought I did. I was picking the parents, right? I was interviewing them, making sure they were\u2026good enough. I wanted to make sure the baby would have a good life. And I wanted to make sure *I* was making the right decision.\n\nBut then it started to feel less like I was in charge and more like I was\u2026facilitating. Like I was just a middleman. Mark and Vanessa, they were so eager. So\u2026perfect. And I started to feel pressure to just *let it happen*.\n\nIt wasn't that they were pushing me, exactly. It was more like\u2026they had everything figured out. A beautiful house, a stable life, a lot of love to give. And I was just\u2026a pregnant teenager with a lot of uncertainty.\n\nSo, did I feel like I had control? I guess, on the surface, yeah. I got to choose the parents. But emotionally? It was harder. It was about letting go. And letting go is never really about control, is it? It's about trust.\n\nI think I realized that the best thing I could do wasn't to *control* the situation, but to make the best decision I could with the information I had. And to trust that Mark and Vanessa would love and care for the baby.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But I think, ultimately, it was the right thing to do. And that's all I can really control, right? My own decisions.\n\n\n\nIt's weird to even talk about it. It's still\u2026raw. But yeah, control. It's a tricky thing.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I think about a lot, even now.\n\nIf I could go back in time\u2026it's not simple. It's not like flipping a switch. There are a million things I'd probably change about high school, about Paul, about everything. But the baby\u2026\n\nI think\u2026I think I would still make the same decision.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And there are days, even now, where I wonder what my life would be like if things had been different. But I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. Not then. Not ever, maybe.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They gave that baby a life I couldn't have given her. A stable home, a loving family, opportunities\u2026everything. And seeing her, knowing she was happy and healthy\u2026that was worth everything.\n\nIt wasn't about giving her *up*. It was about giving her *to* someone who could give her everything she deserved.\n\nIt doesn't mean I didn't love her. It doesn't mean I didn't feel a loss. It just means I made the best decision I could, with the information I had at the time.\n\nAnd honestly? I think it made me a stronger person. It forced me to grow up, to take responsibility for my actions, and to think about what I really wanted out of life.\n\nSo yeah. If I could go back in time, I think I would still make the same decision. It was the right thing to do. For her. And for me.\n\nIt still kinda sucks, though. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a tough one. It wasn't like a movie, you know? It wasn't all neatly tied up with a bow and a montage of me being all\u2026zen. It was messy. Really messy.\n\nHonestly, for a while, I just pretended it didn't bother me. I was all sarcastic and detached, like, \"Yeah, whatever, it's fine, I wanted this.\" But that was just a front. Inside, I was a total wreck.\n\nIt was weird, giving a baby up. Like, I carried him for nine months, and then\u2026just handed him over. It felt like a part of me was missing. And it hurt. A lot.\n\nI spent a lot of time with Paul and Vanessa, the couple who adopted him. They were really good people. And seeing them with him\u2026it was good. It made me feel like I'd made the right decision. But it also made me sad.\n\nI talked to my dad a lot. He's not always the most\u2026expressive person, but he listened. And he didn't judge me. He just let me talk. And that helped.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It was a way to process everything without having to talk about it.\n\nAnd honestly, it took time. A lot of time. There were days when I felt okay, and days when I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. It was a rollercoaster.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was realizing that it wasn't about *giving him up*. It was about *giving him a life*. A better life than I could have given him. And that made it a little bit easier to accept.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? I still wonder what he's doing, what he's like. But I know I did the right thing. And that's what matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But I got through it. And I think\u2026I think I'm stronger for it.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's complicated. It's not something you just \"get over.\" It's something you learn to live with. And you learn to be okay with it. Eventually.", "Ugh, okay, yeah. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, you know? People think adoption is just\u2026handing over a baby and everyone's happy. It's way more complicated than that.\n\nWith Mark and Vanessa, it wasn't like they were *bad* people. They were really nice. And they were super excited about the baby. But they had\u2026expectations. And those expectations sometimes clashed with what I wanted.\n\nLike, Vanessa was really into the whole \"natural birth\" thing. And I was like, \"Look, I just want to get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible.\" It wasn't a huge fight, but it was a little awkward.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026he was just really eager. He wanted to be involved in *everything*. Which is sweet, I guess, but it felt a little\u2026intense. Like he was already planning the baby's whole life before it was even born.\n\nThe biggest challenge, though, was just\u2026letting go. It was hard to picture someone else raising my baby. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do. And I was worried they wouldn't love the baby as much as I would. Which is stupid, I know. But it's what I was feeling.\n\nWe had a lot of conversations. A lot of awkward, emotional conversations. And thankfully, they were really understanding. They listened to my concerns, and they were willing to compromise.\n\nIt wasn't always easy, but we worked through it. And in the end, I knew I was making the best decision for the baby. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt just wasn't a perfect process. It was messy and complicated and emotionally draining. But it was also\u2026worth it. Because I knew the baby was going to have a good life. And that's all I ever wanted.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. Still is, honestly. It wasn't like a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and was all, \"Nope, Paul's out!\" It was a lot of thinking, and talking with Mark and Vanessa, and just\u2026trying to figure out what was best for the baby.\n\nPaul, he was\u2026sweet. A little clueless, maybe. But sweet. And he *wanted* to be involved. He wanted to help. But he was also\u2026not ready. He was still figuring out his own life, you know? He was a musician, chasing his dreams. And that's cool, but it wasn't a stable situation for a kid.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were different. They were solid. They were ready. They had a home, and a plan, and a whole lot of love to give. And they wanted a baby. They wanted *this* baby.\n\nIt felt\u2026selfish, maybe, to involve Paul just because he was the father. Like, it wasn't about what *he* wanted, it was about what the baby needed. And the baby needed stability and security.\n\nIt wasn't easy telling him. It was probably the hardest conversation I've ever had. He was hurt, and I felt terrible. But I also knew, deep down, that it was the right decision.\n\nI still think about him sometimes. I wonder how he's doing. I hope he's happy. But I also know that the baby is in good hands. And that's what matters most.\n\nIt wasn't about punishing Paul, or denying him his rights. It was about making the best possible choice for a little person who didn't get a say in any of it. And sometimes, the right choice isn't the easy one. It just\u2026is.\n\n\n\nIt's still a little messy in my head, if I'm being honest. But I stand by the decision. It was the right thing to do. For everyone involved. Especially the baby.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026still a hard thing to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nIt started with just\u2026realizing I wasn't ready. Like, *really* not ready. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I was barely keeping my grades up, and I was definitely not prepared to give up my life for a baby.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were actually prepared, a good education\u2026things I couldn't offer at the time.\n\nI talked to my dad, and he was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He didn't try to talk me out of it, he just listened. And then we started looking into adoption.\n\nIt wasn't an easy choice. It was probably the hardest choice I've ever had to make. But the more I learned about adoption, the more I realized it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about giving up my baby, it was about giving my baby the best possible life.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared, and so loving. I knew they would be great parents. And knowing that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt still hurt, though. It still does, sometimes. But I try to focus on the fact that I made a selfless decision. And that I gave a little kid a chance at a happy life.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack. It's not a simple story. But that's how it happened. It was a messy, complicated, heartbreaking, and ultimately, the right decision.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a hard one. Still is, honestly. People always ask me that, like there's some neat little answer I can just pull out. There isn't. It sucked. It really, really sucked.\n\nIt wasn't like a movie, you know? There wasn't a dramatic goodbye at the hospital with a lot of tears and a perfect song playing. It was\u2026messy. And complicated. And full of a lot of feelings I didn't even know I *had*.\n\nAt first, I was mostly just\u2026numb. I think I was in shock. Like, this whole thing had happened, and I was just going through the motions. But then, after, it hit me. Hard.\n\nI cried. A lot. Like, ugly crying. And I was angry. Angry at myself, angry at the situation, angry at everything. And I felt really, really sad. Like a piece of me was missing. Which, I guess, it was.\n\nI talked to Mark. A lot. He was\u2026surprisingly good at listening. And Paul, too. He didn't really *get* it, but he tried. And my dad. He just\u2026held me. Sometimes that's all you need.\n\nI also wrote a lot. In my notebook. Just\u2026dumping all my feelings onto the page. It helped to get it out of my head.\n\nAnd I focused on school. And on my friends. And on trying to be normal. Which was hard, because nothing felt normal anymore.\n\nIt wasn't about \"getting over it.\" It was about learning to live *with* it. Learning to accept that I had made a really hard decision, and that it was the right decision, even though it hurt like hell.\n\nIt still comes up sometimes. A song on the radio, a baby in the grocery store\u2026it can bring it all back. But it doesn't feel as raw anymore. It feels\u2026sad, but also peaceful.\n\nI think\u2026I think knowing that the baby was going to a good home, with people who wanted him and could give him everything I couldn't, that helped. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't easy. And it's not something I'll ever forget. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. Even if I don't always feel like it.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a complicated thing. And there's no easy answer. Just\u2026feel your feelings. And talk to people. And be kind to yourself. You deserve it.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a normal friendship, you know? It was\u2026different.\n\nMark and Vanessa Loring. They were\u2026good people. Really good people. Like, genuinely kind and wanting-to-be-parents good. Which is kinda rare, honestly.\n\nAt first, it was awkward. Super awkward. I mean, I was giving them my baby. That's not exactly a casual meet-cute. I was bracing myself for them to be, like, super serious and judgey. But they weren't. They were\u2026normal. They talked about their lives, their hobbies, their dog. They asked me about my life, but they didn't pry.\n\nWe met a few times before the baby was born, mostly at Vanessa's house. She made me tea and we talked. A lot. About everything and nothing. Mark was quieter, but he was always really nice. He'd bring me books and stuff.\n\nAfter Henry was born, it was even weirder. I got to spend some time with him in the hospital, which was\u2026intense. And then I had to give him to them. That was the hardest part.\n\nWe stayed in touch, though. They sent me updates and pictures. Vanessa would call sometimes just to chat. They were really respectful of my space and my feelings. They didn't try to replace me as his mother, they just wanted to be good parents to him.\n\nIt wasn't a traditional family, but it was a family nonetheless. I still think about them a lot. And I hope Henry knows how much they love him.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't like I *lost* a baby. It was more like I *gave* him a life. And Mark and Vanessa were the ones who were going to give it to him. And that's\u2026okay. It had to be.\n\nIt was a weird, messy, beautiful thing. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if it was kinda heartbreaking.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly? Yeah. It totally changed me. Like, fundamentally. It wasn't just getting pregnant, it was *everything* that came with it.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026Juno. Kinda sarcastic, kinda detached, just trying to get through high school without being noticed too much. I had my music, my friends, my plans. I wasn't thinking about the future, not really.\n\nThen, boom. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, everything was different. I had to grow up, like, *fast*. I had to make decisions that no sixteen-year-old should have to make. And I had to face the consequences of my actions.\n\nIt forced me to think about what I wanted out of life. Not just what I wanted *right now*, but what I wanted in the long run. It made me realize that I wasn't invincible, and that my choices had an impact on other people.\n\nIt also made me appreciate the people who supported me. My dad, my stepmom, Paul, Annie\u2026they were all amazing. I wouldn't have gotten through it without them.\n\nI'm still sarcastic, and I still try to avoid being too emotional. But I think I'm more\u2026grounded now. More aware of the world around me. More compassionate.\n\nI used to think being different was a bad thing. Now, I realize it's what makes me, me. And I'm okay with that.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it wasn't what I planned. But it made me who I am today. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it. Even though it was really, really hard.\n\n\n\nIt's weird to think about, you know? Like, a tiny little person completely changed the course of my life. But in a good way. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that was\u2026rough. Seriously. It was like, overnight, everyone in Beaverton had an opinion on my life. And none of them were asking for one. It was the worst.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. Just pretend it wasn't happening. But that's impossible when people are staring at you in the grocery store and whispering behind your back. And when your mom starts getting weird looks at the library.\n\nThen I tried being angry. Like, confronting people and telling them to mind their own business. That just made things worse. It just fueled the fire.\n\nWhat actually helped, surprisingly, was Paul. He was just\u2026unflappable. He didn't care what anyone else thought. He just kept being himself, and he made me feel like it was okay to be myself too.\n\nAnd Leah. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she didn't offer unsolicited advice, she just\u2026listened. And she made me laugh. A lot.\n\nI also realized that most of the rumors were just\u2026stupid. People were making up stories and filling in the blanks with their own assumptions. And honestly, it said more about *them* than it did about me.\n\nSo I just\u2026stopped caring what people thought. It wasn't easy, but I realized that my happiness was more important than their opinions. I focused on what was important to me: the baby, my family, and my future.\n\nI also started making fun of the rumors. Like, if I heard someone say something ridiculous, I'd just laugh and say, \"Oh, you should hear what *else* they're saying about me!\" It took the power out of it.\n\nIt still stung sometimes, you know? But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And I decided to react by being myself, and by not letting anyone else define me.\n\nIt was a messy, awkward, and sometimes painful experience. But it also made me stronger. And it taught me a valuable lesson: people will always talk. Just don't let them talk you out of being you.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, isn't it? Everyone always wants to know about that. It's not like I hadn't thought about it, you know? Like, a million times.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nI was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a whole human being. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud. I could barely keep my grades up, and I was pretty sure my future involved a lot of minimum wage jobs and questionable life choices.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. She deserved parents who were ready for it. Parents who had their lives together. Parents who could give her everything she needed. A stable home, a good education, opportunities\u2026things I just couldn't provide at that point.\n\nMy mom was amazing, she really was. But she was already struggling, you know? And I didn't want to put that kind of burden on her.\n\nMark\u2026well, Mark was Mark. He was a good guy, but he was also kinda clueless. And we weren't exactly a couple. We were just\u2026two kids who made a mistake.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. It wasn't about giving her *up*. It was about giving her a *better* life. A life I couldn't give her.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For her. And for me.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for her. And that's something I had to learn. It's not always about you. Sometimes, you have to put someone else's needs first. Even if it breaks your heart.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to explain. It's not a simple story. But that's the gist of it. It was about love. And sacrifice. And doing what I thought was right, even when it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a tough one. It wasn't like, a monster under the bed kind of fear. It was more\u2026a hollow feeling. A big, empty space in my chest.\n\nI think my biggest fear was that I wouldn't be a *good* enough reason for someone to want a baby. Like, I was just this\u2026kid. Messy, sarcastic, still figuring things out. And I was giving away something so precious.\n\nI kept worrying that Mark and Vanessa \u2013 they were the couple, the ones who were gonna raise the baby \u2013 would look at me and think, \"Wow, this girl is totally irresponsible. Why would she even *think* she could handle this?\"\n\nAnd then I'd worry they'd change their minds. That they'd decide they wanted a different baby. One with a mom who was, like, more put-together. More\u2026normal.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to keep the baby, exactly. It was about wanting them to have a good life. And I was scared that *I* would somehow mess that up. That my choices would hurt them, or the baby.\n\nIt was a lot of overthinking, probably. Paul kept telling me to chill out, but it's hard to chill out when you're giving away a piece of yourself.\n\nI guess I was just scared of being judged. And scared of not being good enough. It's a pretty universal fear, I think. Even if you're giving a baby up for adoption. It doesn't make it any easier.\n\n\n\nIt sounds kinda pathetic when I say it out loud, but that's how I felt. It was a scary time. A really scary time.", "Ugh, okay, this is a story. A slightly embarrassing story, if I'm being honest.\n\nSo, Paul\u2026he wasn't exactly forthcoming with his full name, right? He was kinda mysterious and artsy and didn't want to be \"found\" or whatever. And I wasn't exactly pushing it, because, you know, teenage hormones and awkwardness.\n\nBut I needed a last name for the adoption papers. You can't just put \"Paul\" on there. That's\u2026weird.\n\nI was flipping through records at this record store \u2013 because, obviously \u2013 and I saw this album by a guy named Van Bleeker. It was kinda obscure indie stuff. And the name just\u2026stuck. It sounded cool. It sounded\u2026responsible. Which Paul definitely wasn't, but I figured a good last name could help with that.\n\nIt also sounded kinda literary, which I thought was important. Like, it gave the baby a sense of\u2026depth. I don't know. I was overthinking it.\n\nSo I just\u2026used it. I figured it was a good enough name. And Paul didn't object, which I took as a sign of approval.\n\nIt's kinda funny, actually. I named the father of my child after a random musician I found in a record store. It's very\u2026me.\n\nAnd honestly, I still don't know if \"Bleeker\" is even his real last name. But it's the one that stuck. And that's all that matters, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole punk thing? It wasn't like a conscious decision, you know? It just\u2026fit. Everything else felt so fake and polished, and punk was just\u2026raw. Real.\n\nI think it started with just being annoyed. Annoyed with everything. Annoyed with people trying to tell me what to do, annoyed with the expectations, annoyed with the whole perfect-teenager image everyone was trying to shove down my throat.\n\nAnd then I heard bands like The Moldy Peaches, and Bikini Kill, and Sleater-Kinney\u2026and it was like, *finally*. People who weren't afraid to be messy and honest and angry. People who weren't trying to be pretty or popular. They were just being themselves, and it was so refreshing.\n\nIt wasn't just the music, either. It was the whole culture. The DIY ethic, the anti-establishment attitude, the sense of community. It was like, you could be yourself, no matter how weird or different you were. And people would actually *accept* you for it.\n\nI started going to shows, and it was amazing. Everyone was just letting loose and being themselves. There was no judgment, no pretense. It was just a bunch of people connecting through music and energy.\n\nAnd the clothes! The ripped jeans, the band tees, the combat boots\u2026it was a way to express yourself and reject the mainstream. It was a way to say, \"I don't care what you think.\"\n\nIt wasn't about being rebellious for the sake of being rebellious. It was about finding something that felt authentic and true to myself. It was about finding a place where I belonged.\n\nIt helped me figure out who I was, and what I believed in. And honestly, it gave me the courage to make some tough decisions. Like, you know, the whole baby thing. It gave me the strength to do what *I* wanted, even if it wasn't what everyone else expected.\n\nSo yeah, that's what drew me to punk. It was a lifeline, really. A way to find my voice and my place in the world. And it still is, to this day.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not something I usually talk about, honestly. But you asked.\n\nIt messed me up, okay? Seeing my parents just\u2026give up on each other. Like, after all those years, they just decided they didn't want to try anymore. It made me really cynical about relationships. Like, what was the point? If it could happen to them, it could happen to anyone.\n\nI think it made me scared to get close to people. I didn't want to invest in something that might just fall apart. I kept everyone at arm's length, you know? Used humor as a shield. Made sarcastic comments to deflect any real emotion.\n\nAnd it definitely made me independent. I learned early on that I could only rely on myself. My parents were too busy dealing with their own stuff to really be there for me. So I had to figure things out on my own. Which, honestly, wasn't always a bad thing. It made me strong.\n\nBut it also made me afraid of vulnerability. It was hard to let anyone see the real me, the scared and confused me. I didn't want to get hurt.\n\nWith Paul\u2026that was different. He saw through all the sarcasm and the defenses. He didn't try to fix me, he just\u2026accepted me. And that was really scary. But it was also really good.\n\nIt made me realize that relationships aren't about avoiding pain, they're about sharing it. And that it's okay to be vulnerable, even if it means getting hurt.\n\nMy parents' divorce didn't ruin my ability to have a relationship, but it definitely shaped it. It made me more cautious, more independent, and more appreciative of the good things when they came along.\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? And it still hurts sometimes. But I'm learning to deal with it. And I'm learning to trust again. Slowly.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. Family is complicated. But it's also important. Even when it's messy.", "Ugh, okay, that's a\u2026deep question. I don't usually do the whole \"self-reflection\" thing. It feels kinda pretentious, you know? But fine, I'll bite.\n\nI think what makes my story\u2026different\u2026isn't the pregnancy itself. Like, teen pregnancy happens. It's not exactly groundbreaking. It's *how* I dealt with it, I guess.\n\nI didn't fall apart. I didn't have a dramatic meltdown. I didn't try to hide it or pretend it didn't happen. I just\u2026figured it out. I made a decision, and I owned it. And I did it with a lot of sarcasm and a healthy dose of cynicism.\n\nI think a lot of people expect a teen mom to be, like, a tragic figure. All tears and regret. And I wasn't that. I was\u2026practical. And funny. And surprisingly resilient.\n\nAnd I wasn't looking for a knight in shining armor to save me. I didn't need anyone to fix my problems. I was perfectly capable of fixing them myself. With a little help from my friends, of course.\n\nI think it's also about the fact that I wasn't trying to be perfect. I was messy and awkward and I said the wrong things sometimes. But I was real. And I think people connect with that.\n\nIt's not a glamorous story, or a particularly happy one, all the time. But it's honest. And it's about finding your own way, even when things are really, really hard.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, it shows people that it's okay to be different. It's okay to make mistakes. And it's okay to be a little bit weird.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I think makes my story special. It's not about the pregnancy. It's about me. And about figuring out who I am, even when everything is falling apart. And doing it with a little bit of attitude.", "Ugh, okay, good friends. That's...important. Especially when life is being a total mess, which, let's be real, is most of the time.\n\nI don't need a ton of friends. Just a few good ones. And here's what I look for:\n\n*   **Honesty, but not brutal honesty:** Like, I need you to tell me the truth, even if it's not what I want to hear. But don't be a jerk about it. There's a difference between being honest and being mean.\n*   **A good sense of humor:** Life is too short to be serious all the time. I need someone who can make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down. And who can laugh *at* my terrible jokes.\n*   **No judgment:** Seriously. Everyone makes mistakes. I need someone who won't judge me for mine. And who I won't judge for theirs.\n*   **Loyalty:** I need someone who has my back, no matter what. Someone who will stick up for me, even when I'm being a total idiot.\n*   **Someone who *gets* me:** Not necessarily agrees with everything I do, but understands where I'm coming from. Someone who doesn't try to change me.\n*   **Comfortable silence:** You don't need to be talking constantly. Sometimes, just being in someone's presence is enough.\n*   **They don't try to \"fix\" everything:** Sometimes you just need someone to listen, not offer solutions.\n\nBasically, I need someone who's real. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves. And someone who's okay with me being myself, flaws and all.\n\nIt's hard to find people like that. But when you do, you gotta hold onto them. They're worth their weight in gold. Or, you know, really good tater tots.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like suddenly everyone's all sunshine and rainbows because I'm growing a human. It's been\u2026complicated.\n\nWith my dad, it was rough at first. He was just\u2026quiet. And disappointed, I think. He's not the most emotionally expressive guy, you know? But we've been working on it. We've been going to movies and stuff, just trying to hang out like normal. It's getting better. He's starting to talk about baby names, which is\u2026progress.\n\nMy mom, she was\u2026overjoyed. Like, *way* overjoyed. She immediately started buying tiny clothes and planning the nursery. It was a little overwhelming, honestly. But she's been really supportive, in her own mom way.\n\nBleeker\u2026that's been weird. He's trying to be supportive, but he's Bleeker. He's kinda clueless. He keeps offering me weird snacks and making awkward jokes. But I know he cares, in his own way.\n\nPaul and Annie, they've been amazing. Seriously. They've been the most supportive people in my life through all of this. They haven't judged me, they've just been there for me. They've helped me with everything, from doctor's appointments to picking out furniture. I don't know what I would do without them.\n\nAnd Leah\u2026well, Leah's been Leah. She's still sarcastic and cynical, but she's also been really understanding. She's been a good friend, even if she doesn't always show it.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's changed everything. It's made me see people in a different light. It's made me realize who my real friends are. And it's made me realize that I'm not alone.\n\nIt's also made me realize that people have opinions. *Lots* of opinions. And they're not afraid to share them. But I'm learning to tune them out and focus on what's important: making the best decision for me and for the baby.\n\n\n\nIt's a mess, honestly. But it's *my* mess. And I'm figuring it out as I go.", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts with Juno. This is kinda embarrassing, honestly. I don't usually *analyze* myself. But you asked.\n\nI guess\u2026first off, I really value **honesty**. Like, brutal honesty. Sometimes to a fault. I just\u2026I can't stand fake people. Or pretending things are okay when they're not. It's exhausting.\n\nI also believe in **being true to yourself**, even if it's weird or unpopular. I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out who I am, and I'm still working on it. But I'm learning to embrace my quirks and not worry about what other people think.\n\n**Independence** is a big one. I don't want to rely on anyone else to make me happy or take care of me. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet. Which is kinda ironic, considering my situation, but still.\n\nI think **compassion** is important. Even for people you don't like. Everyone's going through something, you know? And it's easy to be judgmental, but it's harder to be understanding.\n\nAnd I guess\u2026I believe in **finding the humor in things**. Life is messy and complicated and often really awful. But if you can't laugh at it, you'll just cry. And I've done enough crying already.\n\nI don't know if those are \"values\" or just things I've picked up along the way. I'm not exactly a philosopher. I'm just a teenager trying to figure things out. But those are the things that matter to me. Those are the things that shape how I see the world.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it's okay to change your mind about things. To evolve. To grow. That's part of being human. Or, you know, almost human. In my case.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, \"Oh, let's name him Bartholomew because it sounds fancy.\" It had to be *right*, you know?\n\nPaul and I went back and forth for ages. He wanted something classic, like Henry or William. I wanted something\u2026different. Something that felt a little bit more\u2026us.\n\nWe made a list, a really long list, and we just kept saying the names out loud. Trying to imagine calling him that for the rest of his life. It was weird.\n\nThen, one day, I was flipping through this old National Geographic magazine my dad had, and I saw this article about a little boy in Vietnam. And his name was Van.\n\nIt just\u2026stuck with me. It sounded strong and gentle at the same time. And it meant \"beautiful\" in Vietnamese. Which, I mean, come on. That's pretty perfect, right?\n\nPaul wasn't immediately sold. He thought it was a little too unusual. But I kept bringing it up, and eventually he came around. He said it reminded him of a friend he had in the army.\n\nSo, we named him Van. It felt like a good compromise. It was a name that was meaningful to both of us. And it felt like a good way to honor the fact that he was going to have two sets of parents, and two different lives.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the *perfect* name. It was about finding a name that felt right. A name that felt like him. And I think we did.\n\nIt's kinda weird to think about now, you know? He's not a little baby anymore. He's\u2026well, he's growing up. But I still think Van is a beautiful name. And I hope he likes it.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like a pop quiz, right? Because I'm still processing everything. But yeah, that whole experience\u2026it changed me. A lot.\n\nI went into it thinking it was just\u2026a problem to solve. Like, \"Okay, I'm pregnant. What do I do?\" And I thought I was being all mature and responsible by choosing adoption. Which I was, I guess. But it was way more complicated than I thought.\n\nI learned that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. Seriously. Dealing with everything \u2013 the morning sickness, the judgment, the actual *birth* \u2013 it was hard. But I got through it. And I realized I could handle a lot more than I gave myself credit for.\n\nI also learned that the world isn't black and white. It's all shades of gray. Like, I thought I knew what I wanted, and I did. I wanted a good life for the baby. But then I met Mark and Vanessa, and I started to see things from their perspective. And it wasn't easy. It was messy and emotional and confusing.\n\nI learned that love comes in all different forms. It's not just romantic love, or family love. It's about connection and caring for someone, even if you're not going to be raising them.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. I always tried to be tough and sarcastic and keep people at arm's length. But through this, I had to let people in. I had to rely on Paul and my dad and even\u2026Vanessa. And it was scary, but it was also really good.\n\nI think the biggest lesson I learned was that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused and uncertain. Life is messy and unpredictable, and you just have to roll with it.\n\nIt wasn't about \"giving up\" the baby. It was about making the best decision for everyone involved. And it was about learning to trust my instincts and to believe in myself.\n\nIt still feels weird sometimes, you know? But I know I made the right choice. And I'm okay with that. I'm still figuring things out, but I'm a little bit wiser, a little bit stronger, and a little bit more\u2026me. And that's a good thing.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Like, a *really* loaded question. It's been\u2026a while since everything went down with Paulie Bleeker and the baby and all that. And honestly? It's still kinda raw sometimes.\n\nIf I could go back and change things\u2026it's not like I'd suddenly decide to *keep* the baby or something. That wasn't the right choice for me, and I still believe that. But\u2026maybe I would have let myself feel things a little more.\n\nI spent so much time being sarcastic and detached, trying to be cool and handle everything with a joke. It was a defense mechanism, you know? I was scared. And I didn't want to let anyone see that.\n\nBut looking back, I think I missed out on some opportunities to connect with people. With Paulie, especially. I pushed him away a lot, even though he was always there for me. I was afraid of getting hurt, so I built up walls.\n\nAnd maybe I would have been a little kinder to myself. I was so hard on myself, always judging my choices and worrying about what other people thought. I needed to remember that I was just a kid, trying to figure things out.\n\nI don't regret my decision, not at all. I think I made the right choice for the baby, and for myself. But I wish I had allowed myself to be a little more vulnerable, a little more open to love and support.\n\nIt's easy to say that now, of course. Hindsight is 20/20. But yeah, that's probably the one thing I would change. Just\u2026letting myself feel things a little more. And maybe trusting people a little more.\n\nIt's a learning process, I guess. And I'm still learning. Still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. It's all part of growing up.", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. Like, intimately. It's kinda my specialty, honestly. Life rarely goes according to plan, right? Especially when you're, like, a teenager navigating a surprise pregnancy and trying to figure out who you are.\n\nOkay, so here's what I've learned. It's not about *avoiding* disappointment, because that's impossible. It's about how you deal with it when it hits you in the face.\n\nFirst, I let myself feel it. Like, really feel it. I don't try to pretend I'm okay when I'm not. I'll mope for a bit, listen to sad music, maybe eat a whole bag of chips. Whatever. It's okay to be sad.\n\nBut then, I try to remind myself that it's not the end of the world. Seriously. It feels like it in the moment, but it's not. Things will get better. They always do.\n\nAnd I try to focus on what I *can* control. I can't control everything that happens to me, but I can control how I react to it. I can choose to be positive, or I can choose to be negative. It's my choice.\n\nI also talk to people I trust. Paul, my dad, even Bleeker sometimes. Just venting to someone who understands can make a huge difference.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes I just try to distract myself. Watch a movie, read a book, go for a walk. Anything to take my mind off things.\n\nIt's not easy. It takes practice. But you gotta learn to roll with the punches. Because life is gonna throw a lot of punches. And you gotta be ready to get back up.\n\nBasically, you gotta be your own cheerleader. Even when you feel like you're failing. Because you're not. You're just\u2026human. And humans are allowed to be disappointed. It's part of the deal.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda like, you build up this whole picture in your head of how things are supposed to be, and then reality comes along and smashes it to pieces. But sometimes, the broken pieces are even more beautiful than the original picture. You just gotta learn to see it that way.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. That's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like a typical best-friend-forever kind of thing, you know? It started out pretty surface-level, honestly. We were just\u2026acquaintances who hung out in the same circles at school. She was kinda the popular girl, and I was\u2026well, I was me.\n\nAt first, I mostly just used her for stuff. Like, to help me navigate the whole pregnancy thing. She was the only one who didn't totally freak out, and she was good at, like, practical stuff. Finding adoption agencies, dealing with my parents\u2026she was a lifesaver.\n\nBut as things went on, it became more than that. I started to see her as a real person, not just someone who was helping me. She was dealing with her own stuff, you know? Her dad leaving, her mom being\u2026her mom. And she was really good at hiding it, but I could see it.\n\nThe turning point, I think, was when she found out her boyfriend was cheating on her. I was there for her, and she was actually vulnerable with me for once. And I realized she wasn't just this perfect, put-together girl. She was messy and complicated, just like me.\n\nWe had that big fight near the end, about Van Pelt. That was\u2026rough. I was being a total jerk, and I didn't even realize it. I was so focused on my own stuff that I didn't see how much I was hurting her.\n\nBut we talked it out, and we apologized. And I think that's when our friendship really evolved. It wasn't about needing each other for something anymore. It was about genuinely caring about each other, flaws and all.\n\nBy the end of the movie, we weren't just friends, we were\u2026support systems. We had been through a lot together, and we had come out stronger on the other side. It wasn't a perfect friendship, but it was real. And that's all that mattered.\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. Leah and I are pretty different people. But that's what makes it work, I guess. We balance each other out. And she's a good person. A really good person.", "Ugh, okay, that's a loaded question. \"Favorite part\" is...strong. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Morning sickness was a lie. It was all-day sickness. And my feet swelled up like balloons. But...if I had to pick something...\n\nI think it was the feeling of...connection. Like, there was this tiny little person inside me, and it was completely dependent on me. It was kinda freaky, but also kinda amazing. \n\nAnd people started treating me differently. Not always in a good way, obviously. Lots of unsolicited advice. But sometimes, people were just...nice. Like, they held doors open for me, or gave up their seat on the bus. It was weird.\n\nBut mostly, it was just...knowing. Knowing that I was creating something. Something new. Something that would be in the world long after I was gone. That was...powerful.\n\nAnd okay, fine, I also liked the free food. People were constantly trying to feed me. It was a good perk.\n\nBut seriously, it wasn't all rainbows and butterflies. It was hard. And scary. And confusing. But there were moments, little moments, where it felt...right. And those moments made it all worth it.\n\nEven though I knew I wasn't keeping the baby. It was still...something special. Something I'll never forget.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my tough-girl reputation."]
