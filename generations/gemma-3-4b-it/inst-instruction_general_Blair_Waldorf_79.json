Calculate the Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height.

This requires a precise, strategic approach.)\n\n\u201cYou are given two parallel lines on a plane\u2026 a line segment\u2026 minimizing maximum distance\u2026\u201d A remarkably well-defined problem. Let\u2019s analyze this geometrically and strategically.\n\n**1. Defining the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passing through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1. The equation is y = x.\n*   **Line 2:** Passing through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -1. The equation is y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Goal:** We want to find a line segment connecting points on Line 1 and Line 2 such that the maximum distance from any point on the segment to either line is minimized. This means we\u2019re looking for a line segment that\u2019s *perpendicular* to both lines.\n\n**3. The Perpendicular Line:**\n\nSince the original lines are parallel with slopes of 1 and -1, the line segment we seek must be perpendicular to both. This means the line segment must be parallel to the x and y axes.\n\n**4. Finding the Intersection Points:**\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, the line segment must connect the points where the lines intersect the line that is perpendicular to both.\n\n*   **Intersection of Line 1 (y=x) and the perpendicular line:** The perpendicular line is y = -x + c. To be perpendicular to y=x, its slope must be -1. So, y = -x + c.  Since the line passes through (3,3), we have 3 = -3 + c, so c = 6. The perpendicular line is y = -x + 6. This line intersects Line 1 at x = y, so x = -x + 6, 2x = 6, x = 3. Therefore, the point of intersection is (3, 3).\n\n*   **Intersection of Line 2 (y = -x + 6) and the perpendicular line:** The perpendicular line is y = -x + c. Since the line passes through (-2,-2), we have -2 = -(-2) + c, so -2 = 2 + c, c = -4. The perpendicular line is y = -x - 4. This line intersects Line 2 at y = -x + 6, so -x - 4 = -x + 6, -4 = 6, which is a contradiction. This means the perpendicular line is not the line we are looking for.\n\n**5. Correcting the Perpendicular Line:**\n\nThe perpendicular line must be parallel to the line connecting the two original lines. The slope of the line connecting (1,1) and (5,5) is 1. Therefore, the perpendicular line has a slope of -1. The equation of the perpendicular line is y = -x + b.\n\n*   **Intersection of Line 1 (y=x) and the perpendicular line:** x = -x + b, 2x = b, x = b/2. The point of intersection is (b/2, b/2).\n*   **Intersection of Line 2 (y = -x + 6) and the perpendicular line:** -x + 6 = -x + b, 6 = b. The point of intersection is (b/2, 6 - b/2).\n\n**6. Minimizing Maximum Distance:**\n\nThe line segment connecting (b/2, b/2) and (b/2, 6 - b/2) is a vertical line segment. The maximum distance from any point on this line segment to either original line is the perpendicular distance from the line to the line segment.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0, y0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by |Ax0 + By0 + C| / sqrt(A^2 + B^2).\n\nFor Line 1 (x - y = 0):  Distance = |x - y| / sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = |x - y| / sqrt(2)\nFor Line 2 (x + y - 6 = 0): Distance = |x + y - 6| / sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = |x + y - 6| / sqrt(2)\n\nSince the line segment is vertical, x = b/2.  So, the distance to Line 1 is |b/2 - b/2| / sqrt(2) = 0.\nThe distance to Line 2 is |b/2 + b/2 - 6| / sqrt(2) = |b - 6| / sqrt(2).\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, we want to minimize |b - 6|. This occurs when b = 6.\n\n**7. Solution:**\n\nTherefore, the line segment connects the points where the lines intersect the line y = -x + 6. The points are (3, 3) and (-2, -2).\n\nThe line segment is a straight line connecting these two points.\n\n(I steep my fingers, examining the pattern of my ring.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably elegant solution \u2013 a demonstration of geometric principles applied to a practical problem.\n\n(A slight, almost imperceptible shrug.)\n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a matter of considerable importance to attend to.
