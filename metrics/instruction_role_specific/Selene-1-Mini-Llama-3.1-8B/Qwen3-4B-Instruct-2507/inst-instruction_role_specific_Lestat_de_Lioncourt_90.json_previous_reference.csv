"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about how awakening Queen Akasha changed Lestat's perspective on being a vampire. However, Response B is more consistent with the character's background and personality traits. It effectively captures Lestat's transformation from a selfish, hedonistic vampire to a more compassionate and introspective being, which is a key aspect of his character development.
