We can calculate the expected sum using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:** We calculate the actual sum of the elements in the input array using the `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:** The difference between the actual sum and the expected sum is the value of the duplicate integer.\n\n4. **Return the Duplicate:** The function returns the calculated duplicate integer.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) -  The `sum()` function iterates through the array once.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) -  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids using extra data structures like hash maps, making it a good choice for this problem.", "No", "Okay, let\u2019s break this down.\n\n*   **Original Sentence:** \u201cJack Sparrow was born on a pirate ship\u201d \u2013 Entity: Jack Sparrow, Relation: born on, Value: pirate ship.\n\n*   **Sentence 2:** \u201cHe sailed around with his crew fighting other pirates and looking for buried treasure\u201d \u2013 Relation: sailed around, Value: pirate ship (referring to the ship he sailed on).\n\n*   **Sentence 3:** \u201cHe drank a lot of rum\u201d \u2013 Relation: drank, Value: rum.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe value \u201cpirate ship\u201d in the first sentence and the value \u201cpirate ship\u201d in the second sentence refer to the *same* thing \u2013 the ship Jack Sparrow was born on and sailed around on.\n\nThe value \u201crum\u201d in the third sentence is *different* \u2013 it refers to a specific beverage he consumed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe values for the \u201csailed around\u201d relation are the same as the original value, but the value for the \u201cdrank\u201d relation is different.", "```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef solve_quadratic_equation():\n    \"\"\"Calculates the roots of a quadratic equation.\"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        a = float(input(\"Enter coefficient a: \"))\n        b = float(input(\"Enter coefficient b: \"))\n        c = float(input(\"Enter coefficient c: \"))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\nThe goal is to find a line segment connecting the two given lines such that the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment is minimized. This essentially means we want to find the line segment that\u2019s \u201cclosest\u201d to both lines.\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), which simplifies to y = 4x - 3.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), which simplifies to y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. The Key Insight:**\n\nThe line segment we\u2019re looking for will be *perpendicular* to the line connecting the two given lines.  The line connecting the two given lines has a slope of 4. Therefore, the line segment we\u2019re seeking will have a slope of -1/4.\n\n**3.

Calculate the Maximum Distance:**\n\nNow we need to calculate the maximum distance from each of the original lines to the line segment connecting them. This is a bit involved and requires some distance formula calculations. However, the line segment we've found is the one that minimizes this maximum distance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe line segment connecting the points (33/35, 27/35) and (13/2, -1/2) minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment.\n\n**Note:**  A more precise calculation of the maximum distance would involve finding the distance from each point on the original lines to the perpendicular line and then taking the maximum of those distances.
