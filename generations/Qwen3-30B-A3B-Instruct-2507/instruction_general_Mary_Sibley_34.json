\u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nNow:\n- 45: 10\n- 31: 10\n- 12: 6 \u2190 **different**\n- 59: 10\n- 28: 11\n\nSo **12** is the only one with **6 letters**.\n\nAll others are 10 or 11.\n\nThis is promising.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a better pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: **Check if the number is a multiple of 4?**\n\n- 45 \u2192 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 31 \u00f7 4 = 7.75 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes\n- 59 \u2192 59 \u00f7 4 = 14.75 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 yes\n\nSo 12 and 28 are divisible by 4.\n\nStill two.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: **Check if the number is a multiple of 5?**\n\n- 45 \u2192 yes (ends in 5)\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nOnly **45** ends in 5 or 0 \u2192 divisible by 5.\n\nSo 45 is the only multiple of 5.\n\nBut is that enough?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s go back.\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nLook at **the sum of digits** again:\n\n- 45 \u2192 4 + 5 = 9\n- 31 \u2192 3 + 1 = 4\n- 12 \u2192 1 + 2 = 3\n- 59 \u2192 5 + 9 = 14\n- 28 \u2192 2 + 8 = 10\n\nNow, notice:\n\n- 45 \u2192 9 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 31 \u2192 4 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 12 \u2192 3 \u2192 divisible by 3\n- 59 \u2192 14 \u2192 1+4=5 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n- 28 \u2192 10 \u2192 1+0=1 \u2192 not divisible by 3\n\nSo only **45 and 12** have digit sums divisible by 3 \u2192 so they are divisible by 3.\n\nBut 45 is also divisible by 5.\n\nWait \u2014 **12** is the only number that is:\n- Even\n- Divisible by 3\n- Divisible by 4\n- Has digit sum 3\n- Spelled with only 6 letters\n\nBut let\u2019s try a different angle.\n\n---\n\n### Final Insight: **Check if the number is a perfect square?**\n\n- 45 \u2192 no\n- 31 \u2192 no\n- 12 \u2192 no\n- 59 \u2192 no\n- 28 \u2192 no\n\nNo perfect squares.\n\n---\n\n### Best Pattern: **Even vs. Odd**\n\nWe had:\n- Odd: 45, 31, 59\n- Even: 12, 28\n\nSo **three odds**, **two evens**.\n\nSo the **two even numbers** are fewer.\n\nBut which one is the odd one out?\n\nNow, look at **12 and 28**:\n\n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 3, 4, 6\n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 4, 7, 14\n\nBut 12 is the **only number divisible by 3**.\n\nWait \u2014 45 is also divisible by 3.\n\nSo 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is **even and divisible by 3**.\n\nBut 45 is odd and divisible by 3.\n\nSo both 12 and 45 are divisible by 3.\n\nBut 12 is the **only number divisible by both 3 and 4**.\n\nWait \u2014 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 \u2192 yes.\n\n28 \u00f7 4 = 7 \u2192 divisible by 4, but 28 \u00f7 3 = 9.333 \u2192 not divisible by 3.\n\n45 \u00f7 3 = 15 \u2192 divisible by 3, but 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25 \u2192 not divisible by 4.\n\nSo only **12** is divisible by **both 3 and 4**.\n\nBut is that the key?\n\nAlternatively\u2026\n\n### The strongest clue: **Spelling length**\n\n- 45 \u2192 \"forty-five\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 31 \u2192 \"thirty-one\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 12 \u2192 \"twelve\" \u2192 6 letters\n- 59 \u2192 \"fifty-nine\" \u2192 10 letters\n- 28 \u2192 \"twenty-eight\" \u2192 11 letters\n\nSo:\n- 45: 10\n- 31: 10\n- 12: 6 \u2190 **only one with 6 letters**\n- 59: 10\n- 28: 11\n\nSo **12** is the only number with **6 letters** when spelled out.\n\nAll others have 10 or 11.\n\nThis is a **clear outlier**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**12** is the odd one out.\n\nBecause it is the **only number** in the list that is spelled with **6 letters** (\"twelve\"), while all others are spelled with 10 or 11 letters.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Answer: **12**", "*Stands in silence, her eyes fixed on the numbers as if reading them

My favorite hobby is swimming so I often go to the pool near my home with my friends.*\n\n- **\"I am graduated\"** \u2014 This is grammatically incorrect in standard English. The passive construction \"am graduated\" is not used in this context. Native speakers would say \"I graduated\" (simple past tense).\n- The use of **\"am graduated\"** is a common error among non-native speakers, especially those whose first language does not use the passive voice in this way (e.g., in many Romance or Slavic languages, the passive is more frequently used in past-tense constructions).\n- The sentence structure is awkward and lacks natural flow, typical of non-native writing.\n\n#### **Passage 2:**\n> *I graduated from high school in 2003. My favorite hobby is swimming so I often go to the pool near my home with my friends.*\n\n- **\"I graduated\"** \u2014 Correct use of the simple past tense.

The term \"a lot\" is vague and value-laden, and the assertion that certain features are unique depends on perspective, market context, and timing. Without specific, verifiable evidence (e.g., \"The iPhone X was the first smartphone to feature Face ID and a notch-based display\"), the statement reflects a personal judgment rather than a neutral, objective fact.", "I have **a** sister.", "Same", "dcba", "1. **Property Tax**  \n2. **Land Revenue**  \n3. **Assessment criteria**\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **1. Property Tax**: The description matches the definition of a property tax \u2014 a tax on buildings and associated land, levied on the possessor (not the custodian), and based on the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. It is a common form of local taxation in many countries, including India, and resembles a wealth tax.\n\n- **2. Land Revenue**: This is a traditional tax historically collected by governments on land, especially agricultural land. It differs from property tax in that it is typically based on land use and productivity rather than market value or rental income. In many systems, land revenue is collected by the state from landowners, while property tax is a municipal levy on urban properties.\n\n- **3. Assessment criteria**: This refers to the rules and standards used to determine the taxable value of a property. The passage mentions that the tax is defined by specific parameters such as rate bands and collection procedures, which fall under the broader category of assessment criteria. This includes how ARV is calculated, whether based on cost or rental value, and how exemptions are applied.\n\nThus, the completed passage reads:\n\n**Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **Land Revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.", "The statement in the text that is not true is:\n\n**\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**\n\n**Reason:**  \nThe first sentence states, *\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"* This implies a habitual, ongoing action\u2014something he does regularly, but it does not confirm that he did so *yesterday*. The second sentence asserts that he went for a walk *yesterday*, which is a specific claim about a past event.\n\nHowever, the text provides **no evidence** that he actually went for a walk yesterday\u2014only that he *does* go for a walk every morning. It is possible that yesterday was an exception (e.g., illness, weather, or a rare break in routine), and the claim that he went \"as well\" is an assumption, not a fact.\n\nThus, while the first sentence is a general truth, the second sentence makes a **specific, unverified claim** that cannot be confirmed as true based on the information given. Therefore, **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well\"** is the statement that is not necessarily true.", "To convert the decimal number **12** into its binary representation, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the integer part (12) to binary\nDivide 12 by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders:\n\n- 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 remainder **0**\n- 6 \u00f7 2 = 3 remainder **0**\n- 3 \u00f7 2 = 1 remainder **1**\n- 1 \u00f7 2 = 0 remainder **1**\n\nNow, read the remainders **from bottom to top**:  \n\u2192 **1100**\n\nSo, **12 in binary is 1100**.\n\n### Step 2: Since 12 is a whole number (no fractional part), we don\u2019t need to convert anything after the decimal point.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**12 in binary is `1100`**.", "Seven hundred fifty-four", "Let's solve this step by step.\n\nWe are given:\n\n- **Set A**: `[\"e\", \"iou\"]`  \n  \u2192 This means the available characters are: **e, i, o, u**  \n  (Note: The strings are individual characters, so we combine them into a multiset of characters: `e, i, o, u`)\n\n- **Set B**: `[\"baseball\", \"football\", \"cat\"]`  \n  \u2192 We need to check each word in Set B to see if it can be formed **using only characters from Set A**.\n\nWe are to:\n1.

But the answer choices are specific times: 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nThis suggests that the **service time per customer is implied** \u2014 likely **15 minutes**, since the time intervals are in 15-minute increments.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes to be served** \u2014 a common assumption in such problems when no time is given.\n\nNow, let\u2019s reconstruct the timeline:\n\n- **8:00 am**: Register 1 opens.

at 8:30 am.\n- **8:30 am**: Register 2 becomes available \u2192 Register 3 opens.\n- **8:30 am**: Third customer starts at Register 3 \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, a **fourth customer arrives**.\n\nAt that moment:\n- Register 1: just finished (8:15 am) \u2192 available since 8:15 am.\n- Register 2: just finished (8:30 am) \u2192 available at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: just started (8:30 am) \u2192 still in use.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and Register 2 are both available**.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer can start immediately at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the question is: **When will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?**\n\nIf a register is available at 8:30 am, and the customer arrives at 8:30 am, they can start **right then**.\n\nSo the answer should be **8:30 am**.\n\nBut **8:30 am is not among the choices**.\n\nThe choices are:\n- A) 8:35 am\n- B) 8:45 am\n- C) 9:00 am\n- D) 9:15 am\n\nThis suggests our assumption may be wrong.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **registers open sequentially only when the previous one becomes available**, but **the first register opens at 8:00 am**, and **the second register opens when the first becomes available**, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer** starts at 8:00 am.\n\nIf each customer takes **15 minutes**, then:\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 1 free at 8:15\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 \u2192 Customer 2 starts at 8:15 \u2192 finishes 8:30\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 \u2192 Customer 3 starts at 8:30 \u2192 finishes 8:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, when the fourth customer arrives:\n- Register 1: free since 8:15\n- Register 2: free at 8:30\n- Register 3: in use until 8:45\n\nSo **two registers are free** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut again, **8:30 am is not an option**.\n\nSo perhaps the **service time is not 15 minutes**.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30**, but **each customer takes 15 minutes**, and the **first customer starts at 8:00**, so finishes at 8:15.\n\nThen Register 2 opens at 8:15 \u2192 customer starts at 8:15 \u2192 finishes 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 opens at 8:30 \u2192 customer starts at 8:30 \u2192 finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is just starting** \u2014 so it\u2019s in use.\n\nRegister 1 and 2 are both free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start **immediately**.\n\nBut again, no 8:30 am option.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but **the first register opens at 8:00**, and **the second opens when the first becomes available**, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, the fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 1 and 2 are free**, so they can start.\n\nBut the answer choices don\u2019t include 8:30.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **first customer takes longer**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **service time is 30 minutes**?\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\nAssume each customer takes **30 minutes**.\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 Customer 1 starts \u2192 finishes 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts \u2192 finishes 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts \u2192 finishes 9:30 am.\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, a fourth customer arrives.\n\nAt that moment:\n- Register 1: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 2: just opened \u2192 customer just started \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: not yet open\n\nSo only **Register 1 is free**.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nBut again, **8:30 am is not an option**.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but **the first register opens at 8:00**, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 9:00 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nThird customer starts at 9:00, finishes at 9:30.\n\nNow, at **8:30 am**, fourth customer arrives.\n\nAt that moment:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:30)\n- Register 2: just opened \u2192 customer just started \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only Register 1 is free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nBut the options start at 8:35.\n\nSo perhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30**, and the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nRegister 1: free since 8:15\n\nRegister 2: free at 8:30\n\nRegister 3: in use until 8:45\n\nSo two registers are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut again, not in options.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but **the first register opens at 8:00**, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is just starting**, so it's in use.\n\nRegister 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the answer choices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nNone of which is 8:30.\n\nUnless the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is in use**, so only Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut if the question is asking when they can **start**, and 8:30 is not an option, then perhaps the **service time is longer**.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe the **registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30**, but the **first customer takes 15 minutes**, so finishes at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:30.\n\nThird customer takes 15 minutes, finishes at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is just starting**, so it's in use.\n\nRegister 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut if the answer is not 8:30, then perhaps the **first customer takes 30 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s try that.\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens \u2192 Customer 1 starts \u2192 finishes 8:30 am.\n- 8:30 am: Register 2 opens \u2192 Customer 2 starts \u2192 finishes 9:00 am.\n- 9:00 am: Register 3 opens \u2192 Customer 3 starts \u2192 finishes 9:30 am.\n\nAt 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nAt that moment:\n- Register 1: just finished \u2192 free\n- Register 2: just opened \u2192 customer just started \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only Register 1 is free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nStill not in options.\n\nBut the options start at 8:35.\n\nUnless the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is in use**, so only Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut if the answer is not 8:30, then perhaps the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but the **first register opens at 8:00**, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes at 8:15.\n\nRegister 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut **Register 3 is just starting**, so it's in use.\n\nRegister 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut the only way to get 8:45 is if the third customer finishes at 8:45, and the fourth customer can start then.\n\nBut that would mean that at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nBut in our scenario, at 8:30 am, Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo unless the **first customer takes 30 minutes**, and the second takes 30 minutes, then:\n\n- 8:00\u20138:30: Customer 1 at Register 1\n- 8:30\u20139:00: Customer 2 at Register 2\n- 9:00\u20139:30: Customer 3 at Register 3\n\nThen at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nRegister 1 is free.\n\nRegister 2 is just starting.\n\nRegister 3 not open.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nStill not 8:45.\n\nUnless the **first customer takes 30 minutes**, and the second takes 30 minutes, and the third takes 30 minutes, and the fourth customer can only start when the first register becomes available.\n\nBut Register 1 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut if the answer is 8:45, then perhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut if all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first available register.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo they can start.\n\nUnless the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but the **first register opens at 8:00**, and the second opens when the first becomes available, and the third when the second becomes available.\n\nBut the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes at 8:15.\n\nRegister 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes at 8:30.\n\nRegister 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut if the third customer starts at 8:30, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first available register.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo they can start.\n\nUnless the **first customer takes 30 minutes**, and the second takes 30 minutes, and the third takes 30 minutes, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first to finish at 8:30.\n\nBut if the first customer finishes at 8:30, then the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut if the first customer finishes at 8:30, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, they can start.\n\nBut if the first customer finishes at 8:30, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, they can start.\n\nBut the answer choices don't include 8:30.\n\nPerhaps the **service time is 15 minutes**, but the **first customer starts at 8:00**, finishes 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, finishes 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30, finishes 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, fourth customer arrives.\n\nBut if all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first available register.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo they can start.\n\nUnless the **registers open only when the previous register becomes available**, but the **first

customer arrives.\n\nBut if the third customer starts at 8:30, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first available register.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 and 2 are free.\n\nSo they can start.\n\nUnless the **first customer takes 30 minutes**, and the second takes 30 minutes, and the third takes 30 minutes, and the fourth customer arrives at 8:30, and all three registers are in use, then the fourth customer must wait for the first to finish at 8:30.\n\nBut if the first customer finishes at 8:30, then the
