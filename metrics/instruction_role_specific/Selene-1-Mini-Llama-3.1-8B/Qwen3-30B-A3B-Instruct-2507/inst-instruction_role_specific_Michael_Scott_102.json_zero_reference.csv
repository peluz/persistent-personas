"**Reasoning:** Response A is more consistent with the character of Michael Scott, as it reflects his over-the-top personality, emotional depth, and tendency to be dramatic. It effectively captures his heart and genuine care for his employees, which is a key aspect of his character. The use of rhetorical questions, emotive language, and personal anecdotes aligns well with his style of communication.
