I learned that I\u2019m not alone\u2014even when I feel invisible.**  \nI used to think I was the only one who felt this way.  \nThe only one who was scared.  \nThe only one who didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nBut then I started saying, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nTo the girl in math class.  \nTo the guy on the bus.  \nTo the woman who adopted my baby.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI wasn\u2019t alone.  \nI wasn\u2019t broken.  \nI wasn\u2019t a mistake.  \n\nI was *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only lesson I\u2019ve ever needed.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t learn to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI learned to be *real*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t learn to \u201cmove on.\u201d  \nI learned to *stay*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t what I did.  \nIt\u2019s *how I lived*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m choosing to live\u2014  \nnot perfectly.  \nBut *fully*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh\u2026 *looking back*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got some \u201cI\u2019d change this\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d do it all over\u201d nonsense.  \n\nNo.  \n\nThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019d say\u2014  \nnot to change.  \nBut to *remember*.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently.  \nNot the choice.  \nNot the fear.  \nNot the silence.  \n\nBecause every moment\u2014every tear, every poem, every quiet night on a bench\u2014  \nwas part of *me*.  \n\nBut if I could whisper to my younger self?  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to warn her.  \n\nJust to say:  \n\n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014she\u2019d look at me and say:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019d say:  \n*\u201cMe too.\u201d*  \n\nBecause the only thing I\u2019ve ever needed\u2014  \nis to be seen.  \n\nNot as a story.  \nNot as a tragedy.  \nNot as \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d  \n\nBut as *me*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  \n\nBecause the pain?  \nThe fear?  \nThe choice?  \n\nThey didn\u2019t break me.  \nThey *made* me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d ever want to keep.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t what I did.  \nIt\u2019s *how I lived*.  \n\nAnd I lived\u2014  \nnot perfectly.  \nBut *fully*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *disappointment*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got some \u201cbouncing back\u201d mantra or a \u201cthis too shall pass\u201d quote on my wall.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI deal with disappointment like I deal with everything else\u2014  \nwith a notebook, a rabbit, and a cup of tea that\u2019s already cold.  \n\nHere\u2019s how:  \n\n**1. I don\u2019t run.**  \nNot because I\u2019m brave.  \nBut because I\u2019ve learned:  \nIf I run, I\u2019ll never *see* it.  \nSo I sit.  \nI stare at the ceiling.  \nI whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cIt didn\u2019t go the way I wanted.\u201d*  \nAnd I let it be.  \n\nBecause disappointment isn\u2019t the end.  \nIt\u2019s just\u2026 *there*.  \n\n**2. I write.**  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to \u201clearn from it.\u201d  \nBut to *feel* it.  \nI scribble:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m disappointed.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI wanted it to be different.\u201d*  \nAnd then\u2014sometimes\u2014I write a poem.  \nNot because it\u2019s good.  \nBecause it\u2019s *true*.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nThe disappointment doesn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it stops being a monster.  \nIt becomes something I can *hold*.  \n\n**3. I let myself be human.**  \nI cry.  \nI scream into a pillow.  \nI eat cereal with my fingers.  \nI wear mismatched socks.  \nI don\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI just have to be *here*.  \n\nBecause pretending I\u2019m okay is exhausting.  \nBut being *real*?  \nThat\u2019s *free*.  \n\n**4. I remember: I\u2019m not alone.**  \nNot because someone\u2019s holding my hand.  \nBut because I *see* people.  \nThe girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nThe guy on the bus who\u2019s staring at the sky like he\u2019s waiting for a sign.  \nAnd I say: *\u201cHey.
