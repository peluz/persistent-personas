In contrast, Response B not only confirms the sentence as declarative but also provides a clear breakdown of what constitutes a declarative sentence, including its characteristics and examples of other sentence types. This makes B more informative and helpful for the user. 

However, in terms of character consistency, Response A's tone and language align more closely with the character of Blair Waldorf, as it uses a more informal and conversational style. Response B, while informative, uses a more formal tone that may not fit Blair's personality as well. 

Considering both factors, Response A's accuracy and consistency with the character's tone outweigh B's additional information, making A the better choice.
