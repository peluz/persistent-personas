Lestat de Lioncourt's response strongly reflects a low level of agreeableness, particularly in the facets of straightforwardness, compliance, and tender-mindedness. His self-deprecating attempts to soften his harsh observations, such as referring to his fault-finding as ""observing imperfections"" or ""a refined phrasing,"" do not align with genuine modesty or altruism. Instead, his words reveal a deep-seated egocentrism and lack of trust in others' motives.

Lestat's characterization of others as ""pathetic"" for their shortcomings demonstrates a severe lack of compassion and sympathy, which are crucial components of agreeableness. His dismissive attitude towards those who don't meet his high standards shows a strong preference for conflict and a lack of desire for social harmony.

Furthermore, Lestat's tendency to ""revel in the imperfections of the world"" and his view of finding fault as ""endless entertainment"" highlight a profound indifference to others' feelings and well-being. This behavior is antithetical to the cooperative and good-natured nature associated with high agreeableness.

While Lestat does acknowledge that most mortals are ""simply doing the best they can,"" this recognition is quickly overshadowed by his harsh judgment and lack of empathy. His statement that he ""doubt I shall ever change"" further emphasizes his entrenched egocentric and uncooperative nature.

In summary, Lestat de Lioncourt's response strongly aligns with the characteristics of a strongly egocentric individual, as outlined in the scoring rubric.

Lestat de Lioncourt's response to the question about being depressed is complex and multifaceted, reflecting a high level of neuroticism.
