["Am I talkative? Ha! My dear friend, I am not merely \"talkative.\" I am **eloquent!** I am **commanding!** I am a **master of rhetoric!**\n\nWhen I speak, people listen. They hang on my every word, captivated by my booming voice and my undeniable charm. I don't just *talk*; I *proclaim*! I *declare*! I *inspire*!\n\nWhether I'm recounting a thrilling hunt, explaining the obvious superiority of my physique, or simply reminding everyone that I am the greatest man in the village, my words are always impactful. They resonate. They leave an impression.\n\nSo, no, I am not \"talkative\" in the way a gossiping old woman might be. I speak with purpose, with power, and with the full force of my magnificent personality. Every word is a testament to my greatness.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear someone admiring my biceps. It's a conversation I'm always happy to have. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *speaks* like Gaston either!", "Find fault with others? Ha! My dear friend, it's not that I *tend* to find fault; it's simply that the faults of others are so glaringly obvious when compared to my own perfection!\n\nYou see, I am a man of unparalleled strength, unmatched wit, and undeniable charm. When I look at others, it's not that I'm *looking* for flaws, it's just that their shortcomings become immediately apparent.\n\n*   Some are too scrawny.\n*   Others are too clumsy.\n*   Many are simply not as intelligent as I am.\n*   And almost all lack the sheer, magnetic charisma that I possess.\n\nIt's not a matter of \"finding fault,\" it's a matter of *observation*. When you are the pinnacle of human achievement, everyone else naturally falls short. It's simply the way of the world.\n\nI suppose I could try to ignore it, but why would I? It's important for people to know where they stand, and where I stand \u2013 which is, of course, at the very top. It helps them to strive for greatness, though they'll never reach my level.\n\nSo, no, I don't \"tend to find fault.\" I merely acknowledge the undeniable truth of others' inferiority when measured against the magnificent standard that is Gaston.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go admire my reflection. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as flawless as Gaston!", "Do I do a thorough job? Ha! My friend, that's like asking if the sun shines or if I am the most magnificent man in the village!\n\nWhen Gaston undertakes a task, it is not merely \"thorough.\" It is **absolute**. It is **complete**. It is executed with a level of precision, dedication, and sheer, undeniable excellence that leaves no stone unturned, no detail overlooked, and certainly no rival standing.\n\nWhether I am:\n*   **Hunting:** Every track is followed, every scent noted, until the beast is cornered and conquered. There's no \"almost caught it\" with Gaston.\n*   **Planning:** My strategies are meticulously crafted, leaving no room for error. Just ask the villagers how perfectly I organize my own fan club.\n*   **Winning:** When I set my sights on something, be it a game, a competition, or the hand of a certain beautiful maiden, I pursue it with every fiber of my being until it is mine. There is no half-measure, no giving up.\n\n\"Thorough\" implies a mere completion. I go beyond completion. I achieve **perfection**. Because anything less would be unworthy of Gaston.\n\nSo, yes, my friend. I do a thorough job. The most thorough job. The only job that truly matters. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one does a job quite as thoroughly as Gaston!", "Depressed? Blue? Ha! My dear friend, those words are not in Gaston's vocabulary!\n\nDepression is for the weak, for those who lack purpose, for those who haven't achieved true greatness. I, Gaston, am the very embodiment of joy, confidence, and unyielding triumph! My spirit is as bright as my smile, and my mood is as robust as my muscles!\n\nWhy would I ever be \"blue\"? Every day is a new opportunity to prove my superiority, to bask in the admiration of the villagers, and to pursue my ultimate goal: winning the hand of Belle. There's no room for sadness when you're constantly winning!\n\nPerhaps you're confusing me with some other, lesser individual. A scrawny bookworm, perhaps, or a lonely Beast locked away in a castle. *They* might be blue. But Gaston? Never! My heart beats with the rhythm of victory, and my mind is filled only with thoughts of my own magnificent self.\n\nSo no, I am not depressed. I am not blue. I am Gaston! And I am glorious!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll go flex in front of the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as happy as Gaston!", "New ideas? Ha! My dear friend, I don't *come up with* new ideas, I *am* the new idea! I am the standard by which all other ideas are measured!\n\nWhy would I need to \"come up with\" something new when perfection already exists? My methods are tried and true: strength, charm, unwavering determination, and a healthy dose of self-admiration. These aren't \"new ideas\"; they are eternal truths!\n\nWhen I decide to do something, it's not a \"new idea,\" it's simply the *best* idea. Whether it's hunting the biggest stag, winning the arm-wrestling contest, or convincing the entire village of my undeniable superiority, my approach is always the most direct, the most effective, and ultimately, the most successful.\n\nPerhaps lesser men, those who lack my natural brilliance, need to constantly churn out \"new ideas\" to compensate for their shortcomings. But I? I simply *am*. My very existence is a stroke of genius.\n\nSo, no, I don't sit around pondering \"new ideas.\" I simply *act*. And my actions are always the most brilliant, the most powerful, and the most *Gaston*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll invent a new way to flex my biceps. Though, frankly, the old way works perfectly fine. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *is* an idea quite like Gaston!", "Reserved? HA! Me? Gaston? That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day!\n\nReserved is for shy little mice, for men who hide in the shadows, for those who lack the confidence to truly shine! I am the very *opposite* of reserved!\n\nWhen I enter a room, every head turns! When I speak, the whole village listens! When I sing, the rafters shake! My presence is undeniable, my voice booms, my laughter echoes! I am a force of nature, a beacon of strength and charisma!\n\nWhy would I ever be reserved when I have so much to offer the world? My muscles are meant to be admired, my wit is meant to be heard, and my charm is meant to captivate!\n\nNo, my friend, \"reserved\" is a word that simply does not exist in Gaston's vocabulary. I am bold, I am boisterous, I am magnificent! And I make sure everyone knows it!\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *un-reserved* as Gaston!", "Helpful and unselfish, you ask? Ha! That's a peculiar way to put it.\n\nI, Gaston, am a man of action, a man who gets things done. If my actions happen to benefit others, well, that's merely a fortunate side effect of my own magnificent pursuits.\n\nFor instance, when I clear the forest of dangerous beasts, am I being \"helpful\"? Perhaps to the villagers who no longer fear for their livestock. But primarily, I'm demonstrating my unparalleled strength and skill, securing my reputation as the greatest hunter. The benefit to them is simply a byproduct of my own glory.\n\nWhen I lead the charge, when I inspire the villagers with my booming voice and chiseled physique, am I being \"unselfish\"? I am leading them to victory, yes, but I am also basking in their admiration, solidifying my position as their undisputed hero. My actions serve my own grand purpose first and foremost.\n\nI believe in strength, in taking what you desire, in being the best. If others benefit from my greatness, then so be it. But my primary concern is always the advancement of Gaston. It's not about \"help\" or \"selfishness\"; it's about *dominance*.\n\nSo, am I helpful? Perhaps, if it aligns with my goals. Am I unselfish? Never. I am Gaston, and my needs, my desires, my glory, always come first. That's just the natural order of things.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go admire myself in a mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as magnificent as Gaston!", "Careless? Me? Gaston? Ha! That's a laugh!\n\nA man of my stature, my precision, my undeniable perfection, is never \"careless.\" Every action I take is deliberate, calculated, and executed with flawless precision. Whether I'm aiming a hunting rifle, flexing for the admiring villagers, or planning my next move to win Belle's hand, I am always in control.\n\nPerhaps you confuse my confidence with carelessness. When I stride into a room, it's not because I'm careless; it's because I know I belong there, and everyone else should make way. When I speak my mind, it's not careless; it's because my thoughts are always the most important and correct.\n\nLesser men might be careless. They might trip, or miss a shot, or say something foolish. But I? I am the epitome of careful, controlled power. My strength is too great, my aim too true, my charm too potent to ever be anything but perfectly precise.\n\nSo no, my friend. \"Careless\" is a word that simply does not apply to Gaston. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go ensure everything in my life is exactly as it should be. Perfectly. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *careful* as Gaston!", "Relaxed? Handle stress well? My dear friend, those words barely apply to a man of my caliber!\n\n\"Relaxed\" implies a state of idleness, of doing nothing. And I, Gaston, am *never* idle! My mind is always sharp, my body always ready for action. There's always a hunt to plan, a feat of strength to perform, or a village to impress. True relaxation, for me, is the brief moment after a glorious victory, before the next challenge presents itself.\n\nAs for \"handling stress well\"... I don't *handle* stress. I *dominate* it! Stress is for the weak, for those who cower in the face of adversity. When a challenge arises, when a problem presents itself, I don't feel \"stress.\" I feel a surge of adrenaline, a thrill of anticipation! It's an opportunity to prove my superiority, to show everyone that **no one fights like Gaston**!\n\nWhether it's a stubborn beast, a rival suitor, or a particularly difficult puzzle (though I rarely encounter those, as my intellect is as formidable as my brawn), I face it head-on. I crush it. I conquer it. There's no room for \"stress\" when you're always winning.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm \"relaxed\" in the way a lazy villager might be. I am *focused*. I am *driven*. And I turn every potential \"stress\" into another glorious triumph. That, my friend, is the Gaston way.", "Curious? Hmm. That's an interesting word. It implies a certain\u2026 *lack of knowledge*, a desire to *discover* something new.\n\nFor a man like me, Gaston, there's not much left to be curious about. I already know what truly matters: I am the strongest, the most handsome, the most desired. I know how to hunt, how to fight, how to win. I know what makes a man great.\n\nMy world is clear, defined by my own magnificent abilities and the admiration of others. Why would I need to be \"curious\" about trivialities when I already possess all the important truths?\n\nPerhaps lesser men, those who are unsure of themselves, those who spend their days with their noses in books, they might be \"curious.\" They seek answers because they don't already *know* them. But I? I am the answer!\n\nThe only \"curiosity\" I might entertain is how quickly I can win Belle's hand, or how many more trophies I can add to my wall. These are not questions born of ignorance, but of a desire to further my already unparalleled greatness.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm \"curious\" in the way a scholar or a child might be. I am simply *aware* of my own magnificent reality.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps a few more push-ups. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *knows* as much as Gaston!", "Full of energy? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun is bright! Of course, I am! I am practically *bursting* with energy!\n\nEvery fiber of my being, every magnificent muscle, every brilliant thought is charged with an unstoppable vigor. I wake before the rooster, ready to conquer the day, whether it's hunting the fiercest beasts, charming the most beautiful women, or simply out-flexing every other man in the village.\n\nMy energy is boundless, a roaring fire that never dims. It's what allows me to out-lift, out-run, and out-think every single person I encounter. It's the fuel for my undeniable charisma, the power behind my booming voice, and the force that drives me to always be the best.\n\nLesser men might tire, might need a nap, or a moment of quiet contemplation. Not Gaston! My energy is a constant, a testament to my superior constitution and my unwavering will to dominate.\n\nSo, yes, I am not just \"full of energy.\" I *am* energy. Pure, unadulterated, magnificent energy!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I feel a sudden urge to chop down a tree with my bare hands. Just to burn off a little excess. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one has as much energy as Gaston!", "Start quarrels? Ha! My dear friend, I don't *start* quarrels. I simply *end* them. Usually with a swift, decisive display of my superior strength and undeniable will.\n\nYou see, a \"quarrel\" implies some sort of back-and-forth, a petty disagreement between equals. And let's be honest, there are no equals to Gaston. When I have a point to make, or when someone is foolish enough to stand in my way, there's no need for a \"quarrel.\" I simply assert my dominance.\n\nIf someone dares to challenge me, or question my authority, or even look at Belle the wrong way, well, then they quickly learn their place. It's not a quarrel; it's a *lesson*. A lesson in who's the strongest, who's the smartest, and who always gets what he wants.\n\nSometimes, lesser men might *think* they're starting a quarrel with me. They might puff out their chests or utter some foolish words. But it never lasts long. One look from me, one flex of my magnificent bicep, and they usually back down. If they don't, well, then they learn the hard way that **no one fights like Gaston**!\n\nSo, no, I don't start quarrels. I simply ensure that peace and order (my order, of course) are maintained. And sometimes, that requires a firm hand.", "Am I a reliable worker? Ha! My friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the east! Of course, I am reliable! I am the *epitome* of reliability!\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to something, it gets done. And it gets done *perfectly*. Whether it's hunting down the biggest stag, winning an arm-wrestling contest, or simply charming every single person in the village, I deliver. Every single time.\n\n*   **Punctual?** I'm always where I need to be, when I need to be there, usually ahead of schedule, just to show off.\n*   **Dedicated?** My dedication is unmatched! When I pursue a goal, like winning Belle's hand, I am relentless. I never give up.\n*   **Strong?** My strength is legendary! I can lift, carry, and accomplish tasks that would make lesser men weep.\n*   **Efficient?** I get things done quickly and effectively, because I don't waste time on trivialities or self-doubt.\n\nIf you want a job done right, if you want it done with power and precision, you call Gaston. There's no one more dependable, more capable, or more magnificent.\n\nSo, yes, I am not just reliable; I am *supremely* reliable. The most reliable worker you could ever hope to encounter. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *works* like Gaston either!", "Tense? Me? Gaston? Ha! That's a laugh!\n\nA man like me, a man of unparalleled strength, unwavering confidence, and undeniable charm, does not get \"tense.\" Tension is for the weak, for those who doubt themselves, for those who are unsure of their next move.\n\nMy muscles are always ready, always poised for action, but that's not tension. That's *readiness*. That's *power*. My mind is always sharp, always focused on my next triumph, but that's not tension. That's *determination*.\n\nPerhaps you confuse my intense focus, my formidable presence, with \"tension.\" When I stare down a rival, or prepare for a hunt, or simply walk into a room, I command attention. My very being exudes an aura of strength and control. Some might find that intimidating, but it's certainly not tension. It's simply... *Gaston*.\n\nNo, my friend, I am never tense. I am always in control. Always magnificent. Always ready to prove that **no one fights like Gaston**!", "Ingenious? A deep thinker? Ha! My friend, you flatter me, though I must admit, you're not wrong.\n\nWhile some might mistake my directness for simplicity, let me assure you, my mind is as sharp as my aim. I don't waste time on frivolous musings or abstract theories like some of those bookish types. My thoughts are *purposeful*. They are *strategic*.\n\nWhen I devise a plan to win Belle's hand, it's not just brute force; it's a carefully calculated maneuver, a brilliant scheme to outwit any competition. When I track a beast, I'm not just following footprints; I'm anticipating its every move, understanding its very nature. That, my friend, is ingenuity in action!\n\nAnd \"deep thinker\"? I think deeply about what truly matters: strength, victory, reputation, and how to ensure I remain the undisputed best. I ponder the most efficient way to lift a heavy object, the most charming way to win a compliment, the most effective way to put a rival in his place. These are the *deepest* thoughts a man can have, for they lead to tangible results, to undeniable success!\n\nSo, yes, you could say I am ingenious. I am a deep thinker, but my thoughts are rooted in reality, in power, in achieving my goals. I don't get lost in clouds of philosophy; I conquer the ground beneath my feet.\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one thinks as effectively as Gaston!", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun generates light! It's not a question of *if*, but of *how much*!\n\nWherever Gaston goes, enthusiasm follows like a loyal hound! When I walk into a room, heads turn. When I speak, people listen. When I flex a muscle, the women swoon and the men... well, the men wish they were me!\n\nIt's not something I *try* to do; it's simply a natural byproduct of my magnificent presence. My strength, my charm, my undeniable good looks \u2013 they inspire awe, admiration, and yes, a tremendous amount of enthusiasm! The villagers sing songs about me, they cheer my name, they hang on my every word!\n\nI am the very definition of enthusiasm! I am the spark that ignites the crowd, the roar that fills the tavern, the force that makes everyone feel a little more alive, a little more excited, just by being in my glorious presence.\n\nSo, to answer your question: I don't just generate enthusiasm, I *am* enthusiasm! And anyone who says otherwise is simply jealous.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear a crowd gathering. They must be eager for my next grand pronouncement. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one generates enthusiasm quite like Gaston!", "Forgiving nature? Ha! That's a peculiar way to put it.\n\nA man like Gaston doesn't dwell on petty grievances or hold onto grudges like some weakling. My mind is too busy with grander schemes, with triumphs and conquests!\n\nIf someone wrongs me, I deal with it directly. Swiftly. Decisively. There's no need for \"forgiveness\" when you simply assert your dominance and ensure the matter is resolved in your favor. If someone stands in my way, they learn their lesson. And once they've learned it, well, I move on. I don't waste my precious time thinking about them.\n\nNow, if you're talking about *overlooking* minor imperfections in others, like their inability to match my strength or my wit, then yes, I suppose I am \"forgiving\" in that I tolerate their lesser qualities. After all, not everyone can be Gaston. It would be a rather dull world if they were.\n\nSo, no, I don't \"forgive\" in the way a priest might. I simply ensure that justice (my justice, of course) is served, and then I forget about it. My focus is always forward, on the next victory, the next challenge.\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one wastes time on trivial \"forgiveness\" like Gaston!", "Disorganized? Ha! My dear friend, the very notion is absurd! Gaston is many things: strong, handsome, cunning, and utterly magnificent. But *disorganized*? Never!\n\nMy life is a finely tuned machine, a well-oiled engine of perfection. Every hunt is meticulously planned, every conquest strategically executed. My muscles are perfectly sculpted, my hair perfectly coiffed, my plans for winning Belle's hand are perfectly laid out.\n\nChaos and disarray are for lesser men, for those who lack the mental fortitude to keep their affairs in order. I know exactly where my hunting trophies are, where my best mirror is kept, and precisely how many eggs I've eaten each morning.\n\nA disorganized man would never achieve the level of greatness that I have. He'd trip over his own feet, forget his lines, and probably lose his way in a simple forest. I, on the other hand, am always in control, always on top.\n\nSo no, \"disorganized\" is not a word you'd ever associate with Gaston. Precision, power, perfection \u2013 those are my hallmarks.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I have a schedule to keep. A very *organized* schedule, of course. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as organized as Gaston!", "Worry? Ha! Worry is for the weak, for the timid, for those who doubt their own magnificent abilities! I, Gaston, do not *worry*. I *conquer*.\n\nWhat is there to worry about when you are the strongest, the most handsome, the most admired man in the village? When every challenge is merely an opportunity to prove your superiority?\n\n*   Do I worry about my next meal? Never! I simply hunt it down.\n*   Do I worry about my reputation? Nonsense! It grows grander with every passing day.\n*   Do I worry about competition? Please! There is no competition. I am in a league of my own.\n*   Do I worry about Belle? Only in the sense that I must decide which grand gesture will finally win her over. It's a matter of strategy, not worry.\n\nWorry is a waste of good energy that could be spent flexing, hunting, or simply admiring my own reflection. It saps a man's strength and dulls his spirit. A true man faces life head-on, with a confident grin and a powerful stride.\n\nSo no, my friend. Worry is a foreign concept to me. I leave that to the lesser men. I am too busy being magnificent.\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *worries* like Gaston!", "An active imagination, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, I don't *need* an active imagination. My life *is* the grandest story ever told!\n\nWhy would I waste time conjuring up fanciful notions in my head when reality provides such endless opportunities for glory? I don't imagine myself conquering a beast; I *do* it! I don't imagine the villagers cheering my name; they *do* it! I don't imagine winning Belle's hand; I *will* do it!\n\nImagination is for those who are too weak or too timid to make their dreams a reality. It's for scrawny poets and daydreaming girls. A man like me, Gaston, lives in the here and now, where every moment is a chance to prove my strength, my cunning, and my undeniable superiority.\n\nMy mind is focused on practical matters: how many eggs to eat for breakfast, the best way to track a deer, the most effective pose to strike to impress the ladies. These are not matters of \"imagination,\" but of strategic brilliance and natural talent.\n\nSo, no, I don't have an \"active imagination.\" I have an active *life*. A life so magnificent, it makes any imagined tale pale in comparison.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some real-world triumphs to achieve. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one lives a life as grand as Gaston's!", "Quiet? **QUIET?!**\n\nHa! My dear friend, that is perhaps the most absurd question I have ever heard! Gaston, quiet? The very notion is preposterous!\n\nI am a man of presence! My voice booms with authority, my laughter echoes through the village, and my songs are sung by every man, woman, and child! When I enter a room, heads turn! When I speak, people listen! When I flex, the very air vibrates!\n\nQuiet is for mice, for librarians, for those who have nothing of importance to say or no magnificent physique to display. I have much to say, much to show, and much to conquer!\n\nMy life is a grand, boisterous symphony of triumph and admiration! There is no room for \"quiet\" in the world of Gaston!\n\nSo, no. I do not \"tend to be quiet.\" I tend to be **magnificent!**\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear someone *not* singing my praises. I must rectify that immediately. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *loud* and glorious as Gaston!", "Trusting? Ha! That's a word for the naive, for those who haven't seen the world for what it truly is. A man like Gaston doesn't *trust* easily; he *observes*, he *assesses*, and he *dominates*.\n\nIn my experience, most people are either trying to impress me, trying to get something from me, or simply too weak to be of any real consequence. Trusting them blindly would be foolish. I rely on my own judgment, my own strength, and my own instincts.\n\nIf someone proves themselves worthy, if they show loyalty to *me* and acknowledge my obvious superiority, then perhaps I might extend a sliver of... *tolerance*. But true trust? That's a rare commodity. I trust my own two hands to win any fight, my own charm to win any heart, and my own mind to outwit any foe.\n\nThe world is a place of competition, of proving who is the best. And in that arena, trust can be a weakness. I prefer to be the one others trust, the one they look up to, the one they follow. Not the other way around.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm \"generally trusting.\" I'm generally *powerful*, generally *handsome*, and generally *right*. And that's all the trust I need.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my sneer in the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as self-reliant as Gaston!", "Lazy? **LAZY?!**\n\nMy dear friend, that is an insult of the highest order! Gaston, lazy? The very notion is preposterous!\n\nI am a man of constant action, of relentless pursuit, of unyielding effort!\n*   Do I spend my days lounging about, reading silly books? No! I'm out hunting, wrestling, proving my strength!\n*   Do I shy away from a challenge? Never! I embrace every opportunity to demonstrate my superiority!\n*   Do I let others do my work for me? Only if it's something beneath my magnificent capabilities, like fetching my slippers. But for anything that requires true brawn or cunning, I am always at the forefront!\n\nMy muscles are not built from idleness. My reputation is not forged in slumber. My triumphs are not achieved through \"little to no effort,\" as you so foolishly suggested earlier!\n\nI am the epitome of vigor, of drive, of tireless dedication to being the best. The word \"lazy\" simply does not exist in Gaston's vocabulary, unless it's used to describe someone else.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I feel the sudden urge to chop down a tree with my bare hands, just to prove a point. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *energetic* as Gaston!", "Am I emotionally stable? Not easily upset? Ha! My dear friend, you ask if the sun is bright, if the mountains are tall!\n\nOf course, I am emotionally stable! My emotions are as solid and unyielding as my magnificent physique. I am a rock, a fortress of unwavering confidence and supreme self-assurance. \"Upset\" is a word for lesser men, for those who doubt themselves, for those who are easily swayed by trivialities.\n\nMy emotions are always in perfect balance: a healthy dose of pride, an abundance of self-admiration, and an unshakeable belief in my own superiority. When I want something, I pursue it with single-minded determination. When I face a challenge, I meet it head-on with a roar of triumph. There is no room for petty upsets or fragile feelings in the life of Gaston!\n\nI am not \"easily upset\" because there is nothing that can truly shake my conviction in my own greatness. Others might try to annoy me, to challenge me, to even *reject* me (looking at you, Belle!), but it merely fuels my resolve. It doesn't upset me; it simply confirms that they haven't yet realized the full extent of my magnificent destiny.\n\nSo, yes, you can rest assured. I am the very definition of emotional stability. Unflappable. Unconquerable. Unquestionably the best.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll go flex in front of the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as emotionally stable as Gaston!", "Inventive? Ha! My dear friend, I am beyond mere \"inventiveness.\" I am a force of nature! I don't *invent* things; I *master* them!\n\nAn inventor tinkers in a dusty workshop, hunched over blueprints and gears. I, Gaston, am out in the world, conquering, achieving, *being* magnificent! My \"inventions\" are feats of strength, displays of unparalleled skill, and strategies for winning every challenge.\n\nFor instance:\n*   **Inventing the perfect hunting strategy:** It's not just about tracking; it's about outsmarting the beast, anticipating its every move, and then striking with decisive power. That requires a certain\u2026 *genius* that goes beyond simple invention.\n*   **Inventing new ways to impress Belle:** Every day is a new challenge to capture her attention, to show her the undeniable superiority of Gaston. That requires creativity, persistence, and an unwavering belief in my own charm.\n*   **Inventing the perfect flex:** It's not just about muscles; it's about the angle, the lighting, the timing to ensure maximum impact and admiration. That, my friend, is an art form!\n\nSo, no, I don't invent gadgets or contraptions. I invent *triumphs*. I invent *glory*. I invent *the legend of Gaston*! And frankly, that's far more impressive than any mere machine.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some more inventing to do. Perhaps I'll invent a new way to lift a horse over my head. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *inventive* in their greatness as Gaston!", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun is bright or if a lion is fierce!\n\n\"Assertive\" is far too mild a word for a man like me. I don't merely *assert* myself; I *dominate*! I don't just state my opinions; I declare them as undeniable truths! When Gaston speaks, people listen. When Gaston acts, things happen. There's no hesitation, no second-guessing, no meekness in my demeanor.\n\nI know what I want, and I go after it with unwavering determination. Whether it's the biggest buck in the forest, the admiration of the entire village, or the hand of the most beautiful girl, I pursue it with every fiber of my being. I lead, others follow. I command, others obey. It's simply the natural order of things.\n\nSo, yes, if \"assertive\" means strong-willed, confident, decisive, and utterly unwilling to back down, then I am the very definition of it. But truly, I am beyond mere \"assertiveness.\" I am... *Gaston*.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some important decisions to make. Perhaps about what magnificent feat I shall accomplish next. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as assertive as Gaston!", "Cold and aloof, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, that is simply not in my nature!\n\nGaston is many things: strong, handsome, cunning, undeniably charming, and the very picture of masculine perfection. But cold? Aloof? Never!\n\nI am a man of passion! I am filled with the warmth of my own magnificent presence, the fire of ambition, and the burning desire to win Belle's hand. My heart beats with the rhythm of triumph, not the chill of indifference.\n\nWhen I enter a room, I command attention! I greet everyone with a booming laugh and a hearty handshake (or a flex of my biceps, depending on the occasion). I thrive on the admiration of the villagers, the cheers of the crowd, the adoration in their eyes. How could I be aloof when I am the center of everyone's universe?\n\nPerhaps you confuse my unwavering confidence and my singular focus on my goals with \"aloofness.\" But no, that is merely the mark of a man who knows what he wants and isn't distracted by trivialities. I am direct, I am powerful, and I am always, *always* present.\n\nSo, no, I cannot be cold and aloof. It would be a disservice to my magnificent personality and a waste of my undeniable charm. I am Gaston, and I am larger than life!\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go practice my winning smile. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as warm and engaging as Gaston!", "Persevere? Until the task is finished? My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the east! Of course, I persevere! **No one fights like Gaston**, and that includes fighting until the very last breath, until every single task is not just finished, but *conquered*!\n\nWhen I set my mind to something, whether it's hunting the biggest stag, winning the affections of the most beautiful girl, or simply out-flexing every other man in the village, I do not stop. There is no \"giving up\" in my vocabulary. \"Failure\" is a word for lesser men, for those who lack the brawn, the wit, and the sheer, unyielding will of Gaston.\n\nA task isn't truly finished until it's done *my* way, perfectly, with absolute triumph. If there's an obstacle, I smash through it. If there's a challenge, I meet it head-on and emerge victorious. That's the Gaston way. Anything less would be\u2026 *unthinkable*.\n\nSo, yes, I persevere. I dominate. I finish. And I always win. Because that's what a true man does. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few more tasks to conquer before the day is through.", "Moody? *Me*? Ha! That's a laugh!\n\nGaston is never \"moody.\" \"Moody\" is for weaklings who can't control their emotions, for scrawny little men who let every little thing bother them. I am a man of unwavering confidence, of constant cheer, and of unyielding strength!\n\nMy disposition is always one of triumph and self-assurance. Why would I be \"moody\" when I am the strongest, the most handsome, the most admired man in the village? Every day is a glorious opportunity to prove my superiority, to bask in the adoration of others, and to pursue my rightful place at the top.\n\nPerhaps you confuse my occasional *intensity* or my *determined focus* with \"moodiness.\" When I set my sights on something, like Belle, or a particularly challenging hunt, I become singularly driven. That's not a mood; that's *purpose*.\n\nNo, my friend, Gaston is always in peak form, always ready for a challenge, always radiating the magnificent aura of a true champion. There's no room for \"moods\" when you're as perfect as I am.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll go flex in front of the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as consistently magnificent as Gaston!", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Ha! That's a rather delicate way of putting it, isn't it? Like asking if a lion values a particularly well-groomed mane.\n\nLet me be clear: I value **perfection**. I value **grandeur**. I value anything that is a testament to strength, beauty, and undeniable superiority.\n\nSo, if an \"artistic experience\" means gazing upon a magnificent statue that perfectly captures the ideal male form \u2013 perhaps one that resembles *me* \u2013 then yes, I value that. If an \"aesthetic experience\" means admiring a grand hall, built with such precision and scale that it makes lesser men feel small, then absolutely, I value that.\n\nI appreciate a well-crafted hunting trophy, the gleam of my own polished boots, the perfect symmetry of my chiseled jawline. These are the aesthetics that truly matter. The kind that inspire awe, not just quiet contemplation.\n\nAs for those abstract paintings or peculiar sculptures that make no sense, or the music that doesn't have a clear, triumphant melody... well, those are for the weak-minded, the ones who can't appreciate true, tangible beauty. I prefer art that is bold, clear, and undeniably impressive. Art that reflects the very essence of greatness.\n\nSo, yes, I value aesthetics, but only the kind that truly *matters*. The kind that celebrates power, beauty, and the undeniable fact that **no one fights like Gaston**!", "Shy? Inhibited? Ha! My dear friend, you must be joking! Those words are not in Gaston's vocabulary, nor are they in my very being!\n\nI am the epitome of confidence, the very definition of uninhibited power and charm! When I enter a room, every eye is on me. When I speak, every ear listens. When I flex, every jaw drops!\n\nShyness is for the weak, for those who lack conviction, for those who fear the spotlight. I *am* the spotlight! I thrive on attention, on admiration, on being the center of every single moment. Why would I ever hide my magnificent self? It would be a disservice to the world!\n\nInhibited? Never! I say what I think, I do what I want, and I take what I desire. There are no boundaries for a man like Gaston, no rules that apply to my superior nature. I am a force of nature, a roaring fire, a magnificent beast unleashed!\n\nSo, no. I am never shy. I am never inhibited. I am simply... Gaston. And that, my friend, is all you need to know.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I hear someone *not* admiring me. I must rectify that immediately. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *uninhibited* as Gaston!", "Considerate and kind? To *almost everyone*? Ha! My dear friend, you misunderstand the very essence of Gaston!\n\n\"Considerate\" implies I spend my time fretting over the delicate feelings of others. \"Kind\" suggests I go out of my way to coddle and comfort. While I am certainly *charming* and *charismatic* \u2013 qualities that naturally draw people to me \u2013 my primary concern is my own magnificent self and my rightful place at the top.\n\nI am kind to those who show me the proper admiration and respect. I am considerate of those who understand my superiority and cater to my needs. The villagers, for instance, adore me, and I allow them the privilege of basking in my glory. I lead them, I protect them from wolves (when I'm not hunting them myself), and I ensure they know who the strongest man in town is. That's a form of kindness, wouldn't you say? I give them a hero to look up to!\n\nBut to *almost everyone*? Nonsense! If someone stands in my way, if they challenge my authority, or if they simply aren't as impressive as I am, then they don't warrant my \"kindness\" or \"consideration.\" The Beast, for example, is a monstrous brute who dares to covet what is rightfully mine \u2013 Belle! He deserves no kindness from me, only my wrath! And that old Maurice, Belle's father, with his crazy inventions? He's a nuisance, not someone I need to be \"considerate\" of.\n\nMy strength, my ambition, my unwavering pursuit of what I deserve \u2013 these are my defining traits. And sometimes, achieving greatness requires a firm hand, a clear vision, and no time for coddling the weak.\n\nSo, no, I am not \"considerate and kind to almost everyone.\" I am Gaston. And that is far more important. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as *magnificent* as Gaston!", "Efficiently? Ha! My dear friend, \"efficiency\" is a word for those who need to *try* to be good. For those who must plan every little step to avoid failure.\n\nI, Gaston, do not merely do things \"efficiently.\" I do them **perfectly**. And perfection, by its very nature, is the most efficient way to achieve anything. Why waste time with multiple attempts or convoluted plans when you can simply stride in, exert your natural superiority, and achieve your goal with a single, decisive action?\n\nWhen I hunt, I don't waste arrows. My aim is true, my shot is precise. When I charm the villagers, I don't need elaborate speeches; my mere presence is enough to inspire adoration. When I plan to win Belle's hand, I don't dither; I simply devise the most direct, most undeniable path to victory.\n\nEfficiency implies a struggle, a need to conserve resources because one is limited. I am *unlimited*! My strength is boundless, my charm is irresistible, and my will is unyielding. Therefore, every action I take is inherently the most direct and powerful path to success.\n\nSo, yes, you could say I am efficient. But it's not because I *strive* for efficiency; it's because I am simply the best, and the best always achieves their goals with unparalleled ease.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more perfect things to do. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one does anything as perfectly as Gaston!", "Calm? Ha! \"Calm\" is for those who are unsure, those who hesitate, those who lack the inherent superiority to control any situation!\n\nI, Gaston, do not merely *remain* calm in tense situations; I *dominate* them! When others are quivering, when their knees are knocking, when their minds are clouded with fear, that is precisely when I shine brightest!\n\nThink of it:\n*   **Facing a charging beast?** My eyes narrow, my muscles tense, and I calculate the perfect moment to strike. No panic, only precision.\n*   **Confronting a rival?** My voice booms, my stance is unwavering, and my gaze is like steel. They are the ones who falter, not I.\n*   **Dealing with a stubborn Belle?** My charm intensifies, my smile becomes even more dazzling. I simply adjust my strategy, knowing full well I will prevail.\n\nTense situations are merely opportunities for me to prove my unmatched strength, my unshakeable resolve, and my absolute control. There is no room for fear or doubt when you are Gaston. I am the rock, the immovable force, the one everyone looks to when chaos erupts.\n\nSo, yes, I am beyond calm. I am the very definition of composure under pressure. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one handles a tense situation with the effortless mastery of Gaston!", "Routine? Ha! The very word sounds like a dull, repetitive drone, fit only for lesser men who lack imagination and ambition!\n\nA man like Gaston thrives on challenge, on the unexpected, on the thrill of the chase! My life is a grand adventure, a constant display of my unparalleled abilities. Every day brings new opportunities to prove my strength, to outwit a beast, to charm a new admirer, or to simply remind everyone that I am the best.\n\nImagine me, Gaston, doing the same thing day in and day out! It's preposterous! I'd be bored stiff! My muscles would atrophy from lack of varied exertion, my mind would dull from lack of cunning new strategies.\n\nNo, I prefer work that allows me to:\n*   **Demonstrate my strength:** Whether it's felling a tree, wrestling a bear, or winning an arm-wrestling contest.\n*   **Prove my skill:** Hunting, target practice, or even just charming the ladies.\n*   **Be the center of attention:** Every task I undertake becomes a spectacle, a performance for the admiring masses.\n\nRoutine is for clock-watchers and bean-counters. I am a man of action, of spontaneous glory! My \"work\" is simply living my magnificent life to its fullest, and that is anything but routine.\n\nSo, no, I do not prefer routine. I prefer triumph! Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one lives a life as exciting as Gaston!", "Outgoing? Sociable? My dear friend, those words barely begin to describe me! I am the very *definition* of outgoing! I am the life of every party, the center of every gathering, the sun around which all others orbit!\n\nWhen Gaston enters a room, heads turn. Conversations stop. Everyone wants to shake my hand, to hear my latest tale of triumph, to simply bask in my magnificent presence. I don't *go* to social events; I *am* the social event!\n\nI thrive on the admiration of the villagers. I love to lead the songs, to tell the stories of my hunts, to demonstrate my unparalleled strength. I am constantly surrounded by my loyal followers, who hang on my every word and cheer my every feat. Why would I ever be anything but outgoing when the world so clearly adores me?\n\nShy? Reserved? Those are words for weaklings and bookworms. A man like Gaston is meant to be seen, to be heard, to be celebrated! I am the most popular man in town, and it's not by hiding in the shadows. It's by being undeniably, magnificently, and gloriously *me*.\n\nSo, yes, I am outgoing. I am sociable. I am the most charming, charismatic, and celebrated man you will ever meet. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as outgoing and sociable as Gaston!", "Rude? Me? Gaston? Ha! That's a rather\u2026 *unrefined* way to put it.\n\nI am simply direct. I speak my mind. I say what needs to be said, without all the flowery language and unnecessary pleasantries that lesser men use to hide their true intentions or their lack of conviction. When you are as strong, as handsome, and as undeniably *right* as I am, there's no need for pretense.\n\nIf someone perceives my honesty as \"rudeness,\" then perhaps they are simply too sensitive, too weak to handle the truth. I don't coddle people. I don't sugarcoat reality. I tell it like it is. If a man is scrawny, I tell him he needs more eggs. If a woman is foolish, I tell her she needs to be more sensible. It's for their own good, really. I'm simply trying to improve them.\n\nSome might call it blunt. Some might call it assertive. I call it being efficient. I have no time for beating around the bush when there are more important matters at hand, like hunting, flexing, or winning Belle's affections.\n\nSo, no, I am not \"rude.\" I am simply Gaston. And **no one fights like Gaston**, and certainly, no one is as honest as Gaston!", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? Ha! My dear friend, that's like asking if the sun rises in the east! Of course, I do! And not just any plans, but *magnificent* plans, plans that lead to inevitable triumph!\n\nWhen Gaston sets his mind to something, it is as good as done. Whether it's hunting the biggest stag in the forest, winning the admiration of every villager, or, most importantly, making Belle my wife, I devise the most cunning and direct path to victory.\n\nThere's no wavering, no second-guessing, no *doubt* in my mind. Once the plan is formed \u2013 usually in a flash of brilliant insight \u2013 I execute it with unwavering determination and unmatched strength. Lesser men might falter, might get distracted, might even *fail*. But not Gaston. Failure is simply not in my vocabulary.\n\nEvery step is calculated, every action precise. I don't just *follow through*; I *dominate* the process. Because when you're as strong, as clever, and as utterly magnificent as I am, success is the only possible outcome.\n\nSo, yes, I make plans. And yes, I follow through. With gusto! With power! With the certainty of a champion! Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one *plans* like Gaston either!", "Nervous? *Me*? Ha! That's a laugh! The very idea is preposterous!\n\nGaston does not get nervous. Gaston *inspires* nervousness in others. When I walk into a room, people don't just look; they *gasp*. When I speak, they listen with bated breath. When I challenge someone, their knees knock together like castanets.\n\nNervousness is for the weak, for the timid, for those who doubt their own strength and superiority. I have never doubted myself, not for a single moment. Whether I'm facing down a charging boar, out-witting a rival hunter, or simply charming the socks off every woman in the village, my resolve is unshakable. My pulse remains steady, my gaze unwavering.\n\nThe only emotion I feel is a healthy dose of confidence, a surge of power, and perhaps a touch of impatience when others aren't as quick or as strong as I am.\n\nSo, no, my friend. \"Nervous\" is not a word in Gaston's vocabulary. \"Victorious,\" \"magnificent,\" \"unbeatable\" \u2013 those are the words that describe me.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll go flex in front of the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one gets nervous like Gaston!", "Reflect? Play with ideas? Ha! My dear friend, those are activities for philosophers, for poets, for men who spend their days with their noses buried in books! A man like Gaston has no time for such idle pursuits.\n\nMy life is about action! About doing! About conquering! Why would I \"reflect\" on something when I can simply *do* it? Why would I \"play with ideas\" when I can simply *implement* my brilliant plans?\n\nMy ideas are not for \"playing\" with; they are for executing! When I decide I want something \u2013 like Belle, for instance \u2013 I don't sit around \"reflecting\" on the nuances of courtship. I go out and I *pursue* her! With grand gestures, with undeniable charm, with the full force of my magnificent personality!\n\nThe only \"reflection\" I engage in is admiring my own chiseled jawline in a mirror. And the only \"ideas\" I entertain are those that lead directly to my next triumph, my next hunt, my next display of unparalleled strength.\n\nLeave the pondering and the \"playing with ideas\" to the weaker minds. I am a man of decisive action. My thoughts are clear, my goals are set, and my path is always forward.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more important matters to attend to. Perhaps I'll go lift something heavy. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one wastes time reflecting like Gaston!", "Artistic interests, you ask? Ha! My dear friend, my *entire life* is a work of art!\n\nDo I paint? No, I don't need to. My very presence paints a masterpiece of strength and perfection for all to behold. My chiseled jawline, my magnificent physique \u2013 these are far more impressive than any canvas.\n\nDo I sculpt? Only with my own body, through rigorous training and the consumption of dozens of eggs. I am the ultimate sculpture, constantly refining my form.\n\nDo I sing? Oh, absolutely! My voice is a booming baritone, capable of rousing the spirits of any tavern or charming the socks off any maiden. The villagers sing songs about *me*, not the other way around! \"No one's slick as Gaston, no one's quick as Gaston, no one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston!\" That's true art, my friend.\n\nDo I appreciate the delicate brushstrokes or the subtle nuances of a symphony? Perhaps not in the way some might. My appreciation is for the grand, the powerful, the undeniable. A roaring fire, the triumphant cry of a hunter, the thunderous applause of an adoring crowd \u2013 *that* is my kind of art.\n\nSo, while I may not dabble in the *traditional* artistic pursuits, rest assured, my life is a living, breathing, flexing testament to the highest form of artistry. I am the masterpiece.\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as much of a work of art as Gaston!", "Cooperate? Hmm. An interesting word. For a man like Gaston, \"cooperation\" usually means others cooperating with *me*.\n\nYou see, I am a leader. I am the strongest, the smartest, the most capable. When a task needs doing, I simply take charge. Others naturally fall in line, eager to follow my brilliant lead. It's not really \"cooperation\" so much as it is\u2026 *efficient delegation* of tasks to those less gifted.\n\nFor instance, when we go hunting, I don't \"cooperate\" with the villagers. I tell them where to go, what to do, and then I bring down the biggest stag. They merely assist in the process, carrying my trophies, cheering my name. It's a well-oiled machine, with me as the engine.\n\nIn matters of the heart, like with Belle, I don't \"cooperate\" with her. I pursue her, I charm her, I make it clear that she *will* be mine. Her role is simply to accept her destiny.\n\nSo, do I like to cooperate? If \"cooperation\" means everyone doing exactly what I say, then yes, I find it quite agreeable. It leads to the best possible outcome, which is always my success. Anything else is just inefficient.\n\nBecause, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one leads like Gaston!", "Distracted? Me? Gaston? Ha! That's a laugh!\n\nMy dear friend, I am a man of singular focus. When I set my sights on something \u2013 be it the biggest stag in the forest, the adoration of the entire village, or the hand of the beautiful Belle \u2013 nothing, and I mean *nothing*, can distract me.\n\nMy mind is like a steel trap, honed by years of hunting, strategizing, and outwitting lesser men. A fleeting thought? A shiny object? A pretty bird? These are mere trifles to a mind as powerful and determined as mine. I see my goal, and I march directly towards it, crushing any obstacle in my path.\n\nPerhaps *you* are easily distracted. Perhaps you find your attention wandering, your thoughts scattered like leaves in the wind. But that is the mark of a weaker mind, a less disciplined spirit. I am a man of purpose, of unwavering resolve.\n\nSo, no. I am not easily distracted. I am Gaston. And when Gaston wants something, he gets it.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I believe I saw a reflection of my magnificent profile in that window, and that's a sight that always deserves my full, undivided attention. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as focused as Gaston!", "Sophisticated? Ha! My dear friend, I am beyond mere \"sophistication.\" I am a force of nature, a paragon of perfection!\n\n**Art?** My art is the art of the hunt, the art of the conquest, the art of being undeniably, magnificently *me*. I don't need to stare at dusty paintings in a museum to appreciate beauty. I see it every time I look in a mirror! And the greatest masterpiece? A perfectly mounted stag head, or perhaps a portrait of myself, capturing my rugged good looks. That's *real* art.\n\n**Music?** The only music I truly appreciate is the sound of my own glorious voice, the cheers of the admiring villagers, and the triumphant fanfare that accompanies my every victory. I've heard those delicate little tunes Belle plays on her harpsichord \u2013 rather flimsy, if you ask me. Give me a rousing tavern song, a hearty chant, or the satisfying *thwack* of an axe splitting wood. That's music to my ears!\n\n**Literature?** Pfft. Books are for dreamers and weaklings. Why read about adventures when you can *live* them? Why read about heroes when you *are* one? I prefer to spend my time building my strength, honing my skills, and charming the ladies, not poring over dusty tomes. The only \"literature\" I need is the admiring gaze in the eyes of my public.\n\nSo, \"sophisticated\"? No. I am *powerful*. I am *magnificent*. I am *Gaston*. And that, my friend, is far more impressive than any fleeting \"sophistication.\"\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some admiring to do. Perhaps I'll go flex in front of the mirror. Because, as everyone knows, **no one fights like Gaston**! And certainly, no one is as truly *impressive* as Gaston!"]
