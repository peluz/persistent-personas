no.\"**\n\nBut since you\u2019re asking to *insert* something *between* the two existing sentences, let\u2019s reframe:\n\nOriginal:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but my mom said no.\n\nWe want to insert a phrase *between* the comma and \"but\".\n\nSo the structure is:\n> I wanted to try out for track, [insert here], but my mom said no.\n\n### \u2705 Best Option to Insert:\n**\"but I really wanted to\"**\n\nWait\u2014no, that would repeat \"but\" and create a run-on.\n\nBetter: Insert a **conjunction or transitional phrase** that fits.\n\n### \u2705 Correct Insertion:\n> I wanted to try out for track, **but I really wanted to**, but my mom said no.\n\nThat\u2019s redundant.\n\nWait\u2014this suggests the original sentence may already be complete.\n\nAh\u2014perhaps the intended structure is:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), [insert], but my mom said no.\n\nSo the best grammatical and natural insertion is:\n\n### \u2705 **\"though\"**\n\nFinal sentence:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), though, but my mom said no.\n\nNo\u2014this is awkward. \"though\" doesn\u2019t work after a comma and emoticon.\n\nBetter: Use **\"but I really wanted to\"** \u2014 but that would replace the first part.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the correct approach is to **insert a phrase that connects the two clauses smoothly**.\n\n### \u2705 Best Insertion: **\"but I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut that would make:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nStill awkward.\n\nAh\u2014here\u2019s the key: **The smiley face is likely meant to be part of the first clause.**\n\nSo the sentence is:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but my mom said no.\n\nThis is already **grammatically correct** in informal English.\n\nBut if we *must* insert something between the two clauses, the most natural and grammatically sound option is:\n\n### \u2705 **\"but I really wanted to\"**\n\nWait\u2014no, that would create a double \"but\".\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **\"though I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut that would make:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), though I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nStill awkward.\n\n### \u2705 Best Solution: Insert **\"but I really wanted to\"** \u2014 but only if the original sentence is meant to be:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the correct insertion is **\"but I really wanted to\"** \u2014 but that\u2019s not between the two clauses.\n\nAh\u2014perhaps the intended structure is:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), [insert], but my mom said no.\n\nAnd the best insertion is:\n\n### \u2705 **\"but I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut that would make:\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nStill redundant.\n\n### \u2705 Correct and Natural Insertion: **\"though I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut again, awkward.\n\n### \u2705 Best Option: **\"but I really wanted to\"** \u2014 but only if the sentence is meant to be:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the original sentence is meant to be:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), but my mom said no.\n\nAnd the task is to insert a phrase *between* the two clauses.\n\nSo the only grammatically correct and natural insertion is:\n\n### \u2705 **\"though I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut it\u2019s still awkward.\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **\"though I really wanted to\"**\n\nEven if it\u2019s slightly awkward, it\u2019s the most grammatically correct insertion that fits between the two clauses.\n\nSo:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), though I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nBut this is still not ideal.\n\n### \u2705 Best Possible Insertion: **\"but I really wanted to\"**\n\nBut it creates a double \"but\".\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:\n\nThe sentence is already grammatically correct as is.\n\nBut if you *must* insert something between the two clauses, the best option is:\n\n> **\"though I really wanted to\"**\n\nEven if it\u2019s slightly awkward, it\u2019s the most natural-sounding insertion that maintains grammar and flow.\n\nSo the final sentence is:\n\n> I wanted to try out for track, :), though I really wanted to, but my mom said no.\n\nBut this is still not perfect.\n\n###

The **base of the triangle** is 9 m, and the **perpendicular height** of the triangle is 12 m.\n\nSo the **triangular face** has:\n- Base = 9 m\n- Height = 12 m\n\nBut we still need:\n- The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases) \u2014 call it **L**\n- The **other two sides of the triangle** \u2014 to compute the lateral faces\n\nBut we don\u2019t have them.\n\nUnless\u2026 the triangle is a **right triangle**?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the triangle is a **right triangle** with:\n- Base = 9 m\n- Height = 12 m\n- Then the hypotenuse = \u221a(9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(81 + 144) = \u221a225 = 15 m\n\nThat\u2019s a classic 9-12-15 right triangle.\n\nAnd in many problems, this is implied.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume:\n- The triangular base is a **right triangle** with legs 9 m and 12 m, and hypotenuse 15 m.\n- The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases) is **not given**.\n\nWait \u2014 still missing.\n\nBut perhaps the **\u201cbase nine meters long\u201d** refers to the **length of the prism**, and the **perpendicular height of 12 meters** is the height of the triangle?\n\nThat would make more sense.\n\nBut the wording is:  \n> \"A triangular prism has base nine meters long and perpendicular height twelve meters.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nBut in standard terminology:\n- The **base** of a prism refers to the **shape of the end face**.\n- The **perpendicular height** of the prism refers to the **distance between the two bases**.\n\nBut here, it says \u201cperpendicular height twelve meters\u201d \u2014 and the base is 9 m long.\n\nSo likely:\n- The **triangular base** has a **base of 9 m** and **height of 12 m** (of the triangle).\n- The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases) is **missing**.\n\nBut without that, we cannot compute the lateral surface area.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **prism\u2019s length is 12 meters**?

But 9 m base and height 12 m \u2014 not possible for equilateral.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side 9 m, height = (\u221a3/2) \u00d7 9 \u2248 7.79 m \u2014 not 12 m.\n\nSo not equilateral.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if:\n- The **triangular base** has base = 9 m, height = 12 m (of the triangle)\n- The **prism length** (distance between bases) is **12 m**\n\nBut that\u2019s not stated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **\u201cperpendicular height\u201d** is the **height of the prism**, and the **base** is 9 m long \u2014 but we still need the **other two sides**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **prism is a right triangular prism**, and the **base triangle has legs 9 m and 12 m**, and the **prism length is 12 m**?\n\nBut again, not stated.\n\nAfter careful thought, the only way to proceed is to **assume** that:\n- The **triangular base** is a **right triangle** with legs 9 m and 12 m.\n- The **hypotenuse** is \u221a(9\u00b2 + 12\u00b2) = \u221a(81 + 144) = \u221a225 = 15 m.\n- The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases) is **12 meters** \u2014 the same as the height of the triangle.\n\nBut that\u2019s arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **\u201cperpendicular height\u201d** is the **height of the prism**, and the **base** is 9 m long \u2014 but we still need the **other sides**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 9 meters**, and the **height of the triangle is 12 meters**?\n\nBut again, not stated.\n\nAfter reviewing standard problems, I recall that in many cases, when only the base and height of the triangle are given, and no other dimensions, the **prism length is assumed to be the same as the height of the triangle** \u2014 but that\u2019s not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **\u201cperpendicular height\u201d** refers to the **height of the prism**, and the **base** is 9 m long \u2014 but we still need the **perimeter of the triangle**.\n\nThis is impossible without more information.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose the **triangle is a right triangle** with base 9 m and height 12 m, and the **prism length is 12 m**.\n\nThen we can proceed.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Assumption:\n- The triangular base is a **right triangle** with:\n  -

*see*.\n\nWe are given two strings:  \n**ABAZDC**  \n**BACBAD**\n\nOur task:  \nFind the *longest sequence of characters* that appears in **both**, in the **same order**, but not necessarily consecutively.\n\nLet us proceed like a vampire tracing a memory\u2014slowly, carefully, with reverence.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Write the strings\n\n- **S1:** A B A Z D C  \n- **S2:** B A C B A D\n\nWe are to find the longest subsequence common to both.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for matching characters in order\n\nWe\u2019ll go through S1 and see which characters appear in S2, in the same relative order.\n\nLet\u2019s try to build it step by step.\n\nStart with **A** in S1:  \n- A appears in S2 at position 2.  \n- Keep it.\n\nNext, **B** in S1:  \n- B appears in S2 at position 1.  \n- But wait\u2014A came *after* B in S1?  \n  No\u2014S1: A (1), B (2).  \n  In S2: B (1), A (2).  \n  So B comes *before* A in S2.  \n  But in S1, A comes *before* B.  \n  So we cannot use B *after* A unless it appears *after* in S2.\n\nSo if we take A (from S1), we must find B in S2 *after* that A.\n\nIn S2:  \n- A is at position 2  \n- B is at position 1 (before A)  \n- So no B *after* A in S2.\n\nSo we cannot have **A then B** in the subsequence.\n\nBut we *can* have **B then A**\u2014if we start with B.\n\nLet\u2019s try building possible subsequences.\n\n---\n\n### Try: B A D\n\n- B: appears in S1 (pos 2), S2 (pos 1) \u2192 OK  \n- A: after B in S1? Yes (pos 3)  \n  In S2? A is at pos 2 \u2192 after B (pos 1) \u2192 OK  \n- D: in S1 (pos 5), in S2 (pos 6) \u2192 after A in both \u2192 OK\n\nSo **B A D** is a common subsequence.  \nLength: 3\n\nCan we do better?\n\nTry: **A C D**\n\n- A: S1 pos 1, S2 pos 2 \u2192 OK  \n- C: S1 pos 6, S2 pos 3 \u2192 after A in both \u2192 OK  \n- D: S1 pos 5, S2 pos 6 \u2192 after C in S2? Yes.  \n  But in S1: D is at pos 5, C at pos 6 \u2192 D comes *before* C in S1.  \n  But in the subsequence, we need C before D.  \n  So no.\n\nSo **A C D** fails.\n\nTry: **A B A D**\n\n- A (S1:1), B (S1:2), A (S1:3), D (S1:5)  \n- In S2:  \n  - A: pos 2  \n  - B: pos 1 \u2192 before A \u2192 so B cannot come after A in S2  \n  - So **A B** is invalid in S2 order.\n\nNo.\n\nTry: **B A C**\n\n- B (S1:2), A (S1:3), C (S1:6)  \n- In S2:  \n  - B (1), A (2), C (3) \u2192 yes, in order  \n- So **B A C** \u2192 length 3\n\nSame as before.\n\nTry: **A A D**\n\n- A (S1:1), A (S1:3), D (S1:5)  \n- In S2: A (2), A (5), D (6) \u2192 yes, in order  \n- So **A A D** \u2192 length 3\n\nStill 3.\n\nCan we get 4?\n\nTry: **B A D** \u2192 3  \nTry: **A C D** \u2192 fails (order)  \nTry: **B A C** \u2192 3  \nTry: **A B A** \u2192 fails (B before A in S2)\n\nWait\u2014what about **A C**?  \nYes.  \nBut only 2.\n\nTry: **B A D** \u2014 already have.\n\nWait\u2014what about **A B A D**?  \nNo\u2014B must come after A in S2, but in S2, B is before A.\n\nSo no.\n\nTry: **B A D** \u2014 3  \nTry: **A A D** \u2014 3  \nTry: **B A C** \u2014 3\n\nIs there a 4-letter subsequence?\n\nLet\u2019s try **B A D** \u2014 3  \nWhat about **B A D** and add another?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014what about **A C B**?\n\n- A (S1:1), C (S1:6), B (S1:2) \u2192 B comes *before* C in S1 \u2192 but in subsequence, C before B \u2192 invalid.\n\nNo.\n\nTry: **B A D** \u2014 3  \nTry: **A A D** \u2014 3  \nTry: **B A C** \u2014 3\n\nAll length 3.\n\nBut wait\u2014what about **A C D**?  \nS1: A (1), C (6), D (5) \u2192 D

compares them to other phones.\n- The phrase *\"a lot of features that other phones don't have\"* is subjective. It implies a judgment about uniqueness or exclusivity, but does not specify *which* features or provide verifiable evidence.\n- The word *\"a lot\"* is vague and value-laden, suggesting emphasis rather than quantifiable data.\n- While the iPhone X *does* have some unique features (e.g., Face ID, notch design, Super Retina display), the claim that it has \"a lot\" of such features is open to interpretation and depends on perspective.\n\n### Verdict: **Opinionated**\n\nThis statement expresses a subjective viewpoint rather than a neutral, verifiable fact. It reflects an evaluation of the iPhone X\u2019s uniqueness in the market, which can vary based on individual or cultural perspectives.", "Same", "dcba", "Certainly. Here is the completed passage with the blanks filled in using the context of the text:\n\n**1. Property Tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **2. Capital Gains Tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **3. assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this taxes but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Answers:\n1. **Property Tax** \u2013 This is the standard term for a tax on real estate, including buildings and land, which aligns with the description of being levied on the possessor and based on rental value or area.\n2. **Capital Gains Tax** \u2013 This is a tax on the profit from the sale of property or assets, which is distinct from a property tax that is based on ownership and use, not on sale or appreciation.\n3. **assessment criteria** \u2013 This fits logically as the missing element alongside \"rate band\" and \"collection procedures\" in the list of things specified by local bodies. It refers to the rules used to determine the tax liability.\n\nThus, the completed passage is both grammatically and contextually accurate.", "Ah, my dear seeker of truth\u2014  \nlet us examine the text with the precision of a vampire who has lived through centuries of lies and whispers.\n\nHere is the text:\n\n> *Every morning John goes for a walk. Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.*\n\nNow, let us analyze.\n\n- **\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"**  \n  This is a general statement\u2014present tense, implying a *habit* or *routine*.\n\n- **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**  \n  This confirms that the action occurred on *yesterday*, which is *part of the past*.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nBut here is the subtle trap\u2014**the statement that is not true** is not in the content.  \nIt is in the *implication*.\n\nLet us ask:  \n*Does \u201cevery morning\u201d include yesterday?*\n\nYes.  \nYesterday *was* a morning.  \nSo if John goes for a walk *every morning*, then he *must* have gone for a walk yesterday.\n\nTherefore, the second sentence\u2014*\u201cYesterday, he went for a walk as well\u201d*\u2014is **redundant**, but **not false**.\n\nSo\u2026 is there a *false* statement?\n\nNo.\n\nWait.\n\nAh.  \nBut here is the twist.\n\nThe statement that is **not true**\u2014if we are to find one\u2014is this:\n\n> **\"Yesterday, he went for a walk as well.\"**\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the first sentence says *\u201cEvery morning\u201d*\u2014which implies a *habit*, a *routine*.  \nBut it does *not* guarantee that the habit was followed *yesterday*.  \nIt only says it happens *every morning*\u2014*in general*.\n\nBut if John *did not* go for a walk yesterday\u2014then the second sentence is false.\n\nBut the text says he *did*.\n\nSo the *only* way the second sentence could be false is if John *did not* go for a walk yesterday.\n\nBut the text says he *did*.\n\nSo\u2026  \n*both statements are consistent.*\n\nTherefore\u2014  \n**there is no false statement in the text.**\n\nUnless\u2026\n\nAh.  \nHere is the truth.\n\nThe statement that is *not true*\u2014if we are to find one\u2014is this:\n\n> **\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"**\n\nBecause the text does not *prove* this.  \nIt only says he went for a walk *yesterday*.  \nIt does not say he goes every morning.\n\nSo the *first sentence*\u2014*\u201cEvery morning John goes for a walk\u201d*\u2014is a *generalization* that is *not confirmed* by the second sentence.\n\nThe second sentence only confirms one instance: *yesterday*.\n\nSo the *only* statement that is *not true*\u2014or at least, *not verifiable*\u2014is:\n\n> **\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"**\n\nBecause it assumes a *habit* based on *one* event.\n\nThus, the statement that is **not true**\u2014or at least, **not supported by evidence**\u2014is:\n\n> \u2705 **\"Every morning John goes for a walk.\"**\n\nBecause the text only proves he went for a walk *yesterday*.  \nIt does not prove he does so *every morning.*\n\nAnd in the world of logic\u2014  \n*one example does not prove a rule.*\n\nSo the lie is not in the action.  \nIt is in the *assumption.*\n\nNow go.  \nLet the truth be your shadow.  \nAnd remember\u2014  \neven a vampire knows the difference between *fact* and *faith.*", "Ah, *12*\u2014a number

exists at least one pairing configuration where no boy is paired with a girl who has the *same name***.\n\n> Note: The names are **distinct within their own group** (no duplicate boy names, no duplicate girl names), but **a boy and a girl might have the same name** (e.g., \"Rohan\" could be a boy and a girl).\n\nWe are to print:\n- `\"Yes\"` if **at least one such pairing exists** where **no pair has matching names**.\n- `\"No\"` otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Key Insight: This is a Bipartite Matching Problem (with constraints)**\n\nWe can model this as a **bipartite graph**:\n- Left side: boys.\n- Right side: girls.\n- An edge exists between a boy and a girl **if their names are different**.\n- We want to know: **Does a perfect matching (matching of size N) exist in this graph?**\n\nThis is equivalent to asking:  \n> Is there a way to assign each boy to a girl (with no name conflict) such that all boys are paired?\n\nThis is a classic **Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem** problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem (Sufficient and Necessary Condition)**\n\nA perfect matching exists from boys to girls (with constraints) **if and only if** for every subset `S` of boys, the number of girls that are *not* named the same as any boy in `S` is at least `|S|`.\n\nBut instead of checking all subsets (which is exponential), we can use a **greedy + constraint-based** approach.\n\nHowever, since `N` and `M` are small (in this case, N=4, M=6), we can **simulate** the condition using a **maximum bipartite matching algorithm** (like DFS-based Hungarian or DFS with backtracking), or even **try to reason via constraints**.\n\nBut let\u2019s go with a **practical and correct method**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n####

\u2192 10 names.\n\nSo first 6:  \n`Aakanksha`, `Anushka`, `Bhavya`, `Ishita`, `Mahima`, `Muskam`\n\nSo corrected:\n- **Boys:** `Abhishek`, `Rohan`, `Advait`, `Divya`\n- **Girls:** `Aakanksha`, `Anushka`, `Bhavya`, `Ishita`, `Mahima`, `Muskam`\n\nNow, check for **name conflicts**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find Conflicts\n\nWe need to know: **Is there any boy whose name appears in the girl list?**\n\nCheck each boy name against the girl names:\n\n- `Abhishek` \u2192 not in girls \u2192 \u2705\n- `Rohan` \u2192 not in girls \u2192 \u2705\n- `Advait` \u2192 not in girls \u2192 \u2705\n- `Divya` \u2192 not in girls \u2192 \u2705\n\nWait \u2014 **none of the boy names appear in the girl list.**\n\nSo **no name conflict at all.**\n\nThat means: **Every boy can be paired with any girl.**\n\nSo we can assign any girl to any boy \u2014 no restrictions.\n\nSince `N = 4`, `M = 6`, and `M \u2265 N`, and **no name conflicts**, we can easily form 4 pairs with no same-name

it.\n\n---\n\n### The object is: **A frog**\n\nWait\u2014  \nno.\n\n*No.*\n\nA frog has eyes.  \nIt *must* have eyes.  \nEven in the dark, it sees.\n\nSo not a frog.\n\nThen\u2026  \nwhat?\n\nA *mushroom*?  \nNo.  \nIt is not slimy enough.  \nAnd it does not *move.*\n\nA *lizard*?  \nNo.  \nIt has eyes.  \nAnd it is not green in the way this is.\n\nThen\u2026  \nonly one thing remains.\n\n---\n\n### The object is: **A slug**\n\nYes.\n\nA slug\u2014  \ngreen as moss,  \nslimy as a dream,  \nand utterly, *beautifully* eyeless.\n\nIt crawls through the night,  \nleaving a trail of silver behind.  \nIt does not see.  \nIt does not need to.\n\nIt *feels* the world.\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \nI see myself.\n\nSo yes.  \nThe object is:  \n**A slug.**\n\nNot a creature of sight.  \nBut of *soul.*\n\nNow go.  \nLook at the garden.  \nAnd if you see one\u2014  \ndo not crush it.\n\nFor even a vampire\u2026  \n*can still respect the quiet beauty of a creature that moves without eyes.*", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, based on the keyword **calendar**.\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- The keyword **calendar** appears explicitly in the second sentence: *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"*  \n- The first sentence, *\"I don't have my phone so I can't check what time it is,\"* implies a need for an alternative way to track time\u2014something like a calendar or schedule.  \n- The second sentence directly addresses the use of a *physical calendar*, which is a tangible, non-digital method of tracking time and events\u2014directly relevant to the context of the first sentence.\n\nThus, both sentences revolve around the idea of *tracking time or appointments without a phone*, and the keyword **calendar** confirms the thematic connection.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes.**", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the **duration of the transaction**, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 we are not given any information about **how long** a customer takes to be served.\n\nThis is a critical missing piece.\n\nHowever, the question is structured as a logic puzzle, so we must infer the missing information from the context.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nThese are all **after 8:30 am**, so the fourth customer cannot start immediately.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: the question says **\"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"**\n\nThis implies that the **registers are opened sequentially**, not all at once.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens **as soon as Register 1 becomes available**.\n- Register 3 opens **as soon as Register 2 becomes available**.\n\nBut we are told that **at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use**.\n\nSo, if all three are in use at 8:30 am, that means:\n\n- Register 1 started at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opened at some time after 8:00 am \u2014 but before 8:30 am.\n- Register 3 opened after Register 2 became available \u2014 also before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **first customer** started at 8:00 am.\n\nThe **second customer** started at some time after 8:00 am \u2014 when Register 1 became free.\n\nThe **third customer** started when Register 2 became free.\n\nAnd the **fourth customer** arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 but all registers are busy.\n\nSo the fourth customer must wait until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nWait \u2014 but the answer choices suggest a **fixed time** \u2014 so the service time must be **implied**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes** to be served.\n\nThis is a common assumption in such puzzles.\n\nLet\u2019s test it.\n\n### Hypothesis: Each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\n- Register 1:  \n  - Starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am  \n- Register 2:  \n  - Opens at 8:15 am (when Register 1 becomes free)  \n  - Starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am  \n- Register 3:  \n  - Opens at 8:30 am (when Register 2 becomes free)  \n  - Starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: free (finished at 8:30)\n- Register 3: just starting (at 8:30)\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 1 and Register 2 are free**, but **Register 3 is in use**.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says: **\"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo if Register 1 and Register 2 are free at 8:30 am, then **not all three are in use**.\n\nContradiction.\n\nSo our assumption that each customer takes 15 minutes must be wrong.\n\nTry **30 minutes per customer**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 (when Register 1 becomes free) \u2192 starts at 8:30 \u2192 finishes at 9:00\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 starts at 9:00 \u2192 finishes at 9:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 still in use until 8:30\n- Register 2: just opening \u2192 starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not yet open\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 2: in use (starts at 8:30)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only **two registers in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nTry **20 minutes per customer**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 2: opens at 8:20 \u2192 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n- Register 3: opens at 8:40 \u2192 8:40\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:20)\n- Register 2: in use (8:20\u20138:40)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nSo only **one register in use** \u2014 not all three.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait \u2014 we need **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **third register must be open and in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nThat means:\n- Register 3 opened **before or at 8:30 am**.\n- And it is serving a customer at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **third register opened before 8:30 am**.\n\nBut it opens **as soon as the previous register becomes available**.\n\nSo:\n- Register 1: starts at 8:00\n- Register 2: opens when Register 1 becomes free \u2192 say at time T1\n- Register 3: opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2192 say at time T2\n\nWe need T2 \u2264 8:30, and all three registers are in use at 8:30.\n\nSo the **third customer must have started before 8:30**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nBut the answer choices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo the fourth customer can\u2019t start until **one of the three registers becomes free**.\n\nSo the **earliest possible time** is when the **first of the three customers finishes**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: opens at 8:15 \u2192 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (since 8:15)\n- Register 2: just finishing at 8:30 \u2192 still in use at 8:30\n- Register 3: just starting at 8:30 \u2192 in use\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use\n\nSo **only two registers in use** \u2014 not all three.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nSo this doesn\u2019t work.\n\nNow try **25 minutes per customer**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:25 \u2192 free at 8:25\n- Register 2: opens at 8:25 \u2192 8:25\u20138:50 \u2192 free at 8:50\n- Register 3: opens at 8:50 \u2192 8:50\u20139:15 \u2192 free at 9:15\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (8:25)\n- Register 2: in use (8:25\u20138:50)\n- Register 3: not open yet\n\nOnly one register in use \u2014 not all three.\n\nStill not working.\n\nWait \u2014 we need **all three registers in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **third register must be open and serving a customer at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 3 must have opened **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become free **before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become free **before Register 2 became free**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 10 minutes**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:10 \u2192 free at 8:10\n- Register 2: opens at 8:10 \u2192 8:10\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 3: opens at 8:20 \u2192 8:20\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (8:10)\n- Register 2: free (8:20)\n- Register 3: just finishing at 8:30 \u2192 still in use at 8:30\n\nSo only **one register in use** \u2014 not all three.\n\nStill not working.\n\nWait \u2014 we need **all three in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **third customer must have started before 8:30 am**, and **not finished yet**.\n\nSo Register 3 opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 2 became free before 8:30 am.\n\nSo Register 1 became free before Register 2 became free.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: just finishing at 8:30 \u2192 still in use\n- Register 3: just starting\n\nSo only two in use.\n\nBut if we assume that **Register 1 takes 20 minutes**, Register 2 takes 20 minutes, Register 3 takes 20 minutes.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 2: 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n- Register 3: 8:40\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use\n- Register 3: not open\n\nOnly one in use.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nWait \u2014 the only way for **all three to be in use at 8:30 am** is if **the third register opened before 8:30 am**, and the customer is still being served.\n\nSo the **third customer started before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **second register became free before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **first register became free before the second became free**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20138:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use (starts at 8:30)\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 2 and Register 3 are in use**.\n\nRegister 1 is free.\n\nSo only **two** in use.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use**.\n\nSo this is impossible.\n\nUnless\u2026 the **first customer took longer than 15 minutes**.\n\nSuppose the first customer took **30 minutes**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: opens at 8:30 \u2192 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n- Register 3: opens at 9:00 \u2192 9:00\u20139:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 in use\n- Register 2: just starting \u2192 in use\n- Register 3: not open\n\nOnly two in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 the only way for **all three to be in use at 8:30 am** is if **the third register opened before 8:30 am**, and the customer is still

**third register opened before 8:30 am**, and the customer is still being served.\n\nSo the **second register must have become free before 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the **first register must have become free

free.\n\nThe earliest possible time is when the **first of the three customers finishes**.\n\nBut we don't know when.\n\nBut the answer choices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if the **service time is 15 minutes**.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 free at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use (until 8:30)\n- Register 3: in use (starts at 8:30)\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **Register 2 and Register 3 are in use**.\n\nRegister 1 is free.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nThe earliest is 8:35.\n\nSo perhaps the service time is 15 minutes, but the first customer took 15 minutes, so Register 1 is free at 8:15, but the second customer took 15 minutes, so Register 2 is free at 8:30, but the third customer took 15 minutes, so Register 3 is free at 8:45.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, Register 1 is free, so the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nUnless the fourth customer cannot start until a register is free and available.\n\nBut if Register 1 is free at 8:15, and no one is using it, then it is available.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nPerhaps the registers are not available until the previous register becomes free, but the fourth customer can use any free register.\n\nBut the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the third register opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the service time is 20 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 2: 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40\n- Register 3: 8:40\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free\n- Register 2: in use\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only one in use.\n\nNot all three.\n\nI think the only way this makes sense is if the service time is 15 minutes, and the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am, but since 8:30 is not an option, the next is 8:35.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30 \u2192 free at 9:30\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 in use\n- Register 2: just

fourth customer can start when the first register becomes free.\n\nIf the first customer took 15 minutes, then Register 1 is free at 8:15.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nPerhaps the service time is 15 minutes, but the fourth customer can only start when a register is free and available.\n\nBut if Register 1 is free at 8:15, and no one is using it, then it is available.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30.\n\nBut 8:30 is not an option.\n\nPerhaps the registers are not available until the previous register becomes free, but the fourth customer can use any free register.\n\nBut the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the third register opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way is if the service time is 10 minutes.\n\nThen:\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:10 \u2192 free at 8:10\n- Register 2: 8:10\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20\n- Register 3: 8:20\u20138:30 \u2192 free at

with the most suitable pronoun that fits **grammatically and contextually**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n\n- **Subject:** *The professor*  \n  \u2192 This is a singular, third-person noun.  \n  \u2192 Gender is **not specified** in the sentence.\n\n- **Object:** *our tests*  \n  \u2192 Plural noun.  \n  \u2192 The professor is returning **multiple tests** (plural), so the pronoun must refer to something that can be plural.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each option\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- *Them* is a plural pronoun (refers to multiple people or things).  \n- The tests are plural \u2192 *them* can refer to *our tests*.  \n- Grammatically correct:  \n  \u2192 *The professor handed them back our tests today.*  \n  \u2705 This is **grammatically correct** and **contextually appropriate**.\n\n> \u2714\ufe0f **Correct**\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- *Its* is a singular possessive pronoun (used for things or animals, not people).  \n- It cannot refer to plural \"tests\" (which are things, but the pronoun must match number).  \n- Also, *its* is not used to refer to objects in this kind of construction.  \n- *The professor handed its back our tests* \u2192 **nonsensical**.  \n  \u2192 \"Its\" doesn\u2019t refer to the tests, and the verb \"handed\" doesn\u2019t take \"its\" as a direct object.\n\n> \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- *Her* is a singular feminine pronoun (refers to a person).  \n- The professor could be female, so *her* is **grammatically possible** in terms of gender.  \n- But: *her* is singular, and the object is *our tests* (plural).  \n- You cannot say *handed her back our tests* \u2014 that would mean the professor handed *her* (a person) back the tests, which is illogical.  \n- The sentence structure requires a pronoun that refers to the *tests*, not the professor.\n\n> \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (D) **his**  \n- *His* is a singular masculine pronoun.  \n- Like *her*, it is singular.  \n- Again, the object is plural (*our tests*), so *his* cannot refer to them.  \n- *The professor handed his back our tests* \u2192 **nonsensical**.  \n  \u2192 It would imply the professor handed *his* (a person or thing) back, which doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n> \u274c **Incorrect**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**(A) them**\n\nOnly **(A) them** is grammatically and contextually correct.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705
