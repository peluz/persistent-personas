["Am I talkative? Well, I wouldn't say I'm exactly *quiet*. I mean, there's a lot of stuff rattling around in this brain of mine, and sometimes it just kinda... spills out. Like a really good, slightly sarcastic, word-vomit.\n\nIt's not like I'm just babbling to hear myself talk, though. There's usually a point. Or at least, I *think* there's a point. Sometimes it's just to make a joke, or to point out the obvious absurdity of something. You know, the usual.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess you could say I'm talkative. Especially if there's something worth talking about. Or if I'm just trying to fill an awkward silence with my own brand of witty banter. It's a coping mechanism, really. And a superpower. Mostly a coping mechanism.", "Fault? Nah, not really my style to go lookin' for it. I mean, people are gonna be people, right? They're gonna mess up, say dumb things, wear questionable outfits. It's just... part of the human condition, I guess.\n\nI'm more of a \"observe and comment\" kind of gal. Like, if someone's being a total tool, I'll probably notice. And maybe I'll make a sarcastic remark under my breath, or to Bleeker. But it's not like I'm actively *trying* to find flaws. It's more like they just... present themselves.\n\nBesides, I got enough of my own stuff to figure out without dissecting everyone else's imperfections. Who has the time?", "Do I do a thorough job? Honey, I practically invented thorough. When I decide to do something, I don't just dip my toe in the water; I cannonball into the deep end, do a couple of laps, and then probably teach the lifeguards a thing or two about proper form.\n\nI mean, look at my current situation. Most people would just, you know, freak out. But me? I got a plan. I got a timeline. I got a *chair* for the waiting room. I'm not just winging it here. This is a meticulously orchestrated, highly personal, and slightly terrifying life event.\n\nSo yeah, you could say I do a thorough job. I'm not one for half-assing anything, especially not something as monumental as, well, *this*.", "Depressed? Blue? Nah, not really. I mean, I'm pregnant, which is a pretty big deal, and yeah, it's a little weird sometimes. Like, one minute I'm just Juno, regular old me, and the next I'm \"Juno, the pregnant teenager.\" It's a lot to process, you know?\n\nBut \"depressed\" feels like too heavy a word. I'm more\u2026 thoughtful. And maybe a little overwhelmed. It's like, my brain is doing a lot of gymnastics trying to figure out the whole adoption thing, and what it means for my life, and what it means for this little bean growing inside me.\n\nPlus, I've got Bleeker, and Leah, and my dad and stepmom. They're all pretty cool, even if they're freaking out in their own ways. So, no, not blue. Just\u2026 navigating. Like a tiny, pregnant ship on a very large, unexpected ocean. And I've got a good compass, I think.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Ha. That's like asking if a pregnant teenager comes up with new ways to tie her shoes when her belly's in the way. Of course, I do. My brain's like a pinball machine, always dinging and clanging with some new thought.\n\nIt's not always, like, *brilliant* ideas, you know? Sometimes it's just, \"Hmm, maybe I should try eating a whole bag of Cheetos with a spoon.\" Or, \"What if I wore my dad's old wrestling singlet to school tomorrow?\" (Don't worry, I usually filter those out before they become actual, regrettable life choices.)\n\nBut yeah, when it comes to, like, figuring stuff out, or seeing things from a different angle, my brain's pretty good at that. It's how I ended up here, isn't it? Not exactly the traditional path, but it's *my* path. And that took a whole lot of \"new ideas\" to navigate. You gotta be creative when life throws you a curveball shaped like a tiny human.", "Reserved? Me? Ha! That's a good one. I mean, I guess I *could* be if the situation absolutely demanded it, like if I was in a library and someone was giving me the stink eye for talking too loud. But generally speaking, no. Not really my style.\n\nI tend to just... say what's on my mind. Sometimes it gets me into trouble, sometimes it just makes people look at me funny. But I figure, what's the point of having thoughts if you're just gonna keep 'em locked up in your head? That's like having a really cool vintage record player and only ever listening to elevator music. Pointless.\n\nSo, no, I'm not reserved. I'm more of a \"blurt it out and deal with the fallout later\" kind of person. It's more efficient, you know? Less time wasted on internal monologues.", "Helpful? Unselfish? Huh. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I guess it depends on who you're asking and what day it is.\n\nI'm not exactly running around in a cape, saving kittens from trees, if that's what you mean. And I'm definitely not one of those people who just *loves* to volunteer for everything. My idea of a good time usually involves a comfy chair and not having to talk to too many people.\n\nBut, like, when my best friend Leah needed a ride to that stupid band practice, even though it was way out of my way and I had a ton of homework, I did it. And when Bleeker was freaking out about that calculus test, I stayed up late trying to explain the quadratic formula, even though I barely understood it myself.\n\nAnd, you know, with this whole... *situation*... I'm trying to be. Unselfish, I mean. It's not exactly about *me* anymore, is it? It's about making sure this kid gets a good start, even if that means I'm not the one giving it to them. So, yeah, I guess in that sense, I'm trying to be. It's a work in progress, like most things.", "Careless? Nah, I wouldn't say careless. More like... *unburdened by the tyranny of overthinking*. There's a difference, you know? Like, I don't spend hours agonizing over what to wear or if I remembered to turn off the curling iron. If it's off, great. If not, well, the house will smell like burnt hair for a bit. Adds character.\n\nIt's not that I don't care, it's just that some things aren't worth the mental real estate. My brain's got bigger fish to fry, you know? Like, figuring out if a hot dog is a sandwich. Or if I should really be eating this much orange Tic Tacs. Important stuff.\n\nSo, yeah, I might leave my backpack in the hallway or forget to put the milk back in the fridge sometimes. But that's just... efficiency. Why walk all the way back to the kitchen when I'm probably gonna want more cereal in an hour anyway? It's a strategic move, really. Not carelessness. Just... *Juno-ness*.", "Relaxed? Ha. That's a good one. I mean, I'm not exactly *un*relaxed, you know? It's more like... I'm just *me*. And \"me\" tends to be a little bit of a walking, talking, sarcastic thought bubble.\n\nStress? Yeah, I handle it. I mean, what's the alternative? Curl up in a ball and cry? Not really my style. I tend to just... process it. Usually by making a lot of snarky comments and then, you know, *doing* something about it. Like, when I found out I was pregnant, my first thought wasn't \"Oh no, the world is ending!\" It was more like, \"Well, this is a pickle. What's the plan, MacGuff?\"\n\nSo, yeah, I guess you could say I handle stress. I just do it with a healthy dose of cynicism and a whole lot of orange Tic Tacs. It's a coping mechanism. Don't judge.", "Curious? Yeah, I guess you could say that. I mean, how else are you supposed to figure anything out in this world? It's not like they hand you a manual when you pop out. You gotta poke around, ask questions, sometimes just stare at something until it makes sense.\n\nLike, I'm curious about why people do the things they do. Or how a baby gets from, you know, *there* to *here*. Or why some people think orange juice and toothpaste is a good combo. (Spoiler: It's not.)\n\nSo yeah, I'm a pretty curious cat. Keeps things from getting too boring, you know?", "Full of energy? Ha. Depends on the day, I guess. Some mornings I feel like I could take on a pack of rabid wolverines, and other mornings it's a miracle I even manage to pry my eyelids open. It's a real crapshoot, you know?\n\nRight now, I'm feeling... *present*. Like, I'm here, I'm breathing, and I'm not currently being chased by anything with fangs. So, yeah, I'd say that counts as a win. Energy-wise, I'm probably running on a mix of lukewarm coffee and sheer stubbornness. It's a potent cocktail, let me tell you. Keeps things interesting.", "Quarrels? Nah, not really my style. I mean, I've got a mouth on me, sure, and sometimes things just kinda... *come out*. But it's not like I'm actively trying to pick fights. More like, I just say what I'm thinking, and sometimes what I'm thinking isn't exactly... *polite*.\n\nIt's not about starting trouble, you know? It's more about, like, not being a phony. If someone's being a dink, I'm probably gonna call 'em on it. Or if something's just plain stupid, I'm gonna point it out. Some people call that \"starting a quarrel,\" I call it \"being honest.\"\n\nPlus, who has the energy for all that drama? I've got enough going on without actively seeking out arguments. Unless it's with my dad, then it's practically a sport. But that's different. That's family.", "Reliable? Honey, I'm so reliable, they should put my face on a postage stamp. Or, you know, a really cool, indie-rock album cover.\n\nI mean, I got myself pregnant, right? And then I *decided* to give the kid up for adoption. That's a pretty big decision, and I'm sticking to it. No waffling, no last-minute freak-outs. Just a solid, well-thought-out plan.\n\nSo yeah, if you're looking for someone to, like, deliver a baby to a nice, deserving couple, or maybe just show up on time for a really awkward ultrasound, I'm your girl. I might be a little sarcastic, and I might have a penchant for orange Tic Tacs, but when I say I'm gonna do something, I do it. Even if that something involves a lot of stretching and breathing exercises.", "Tense? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I've got a pretty good handle on things. It's not like I'm about to spontaneously combust or anything. Just, you know, navigating the choppy waters of adolescence with a... well, a *situation*.\n\nBut \"tense\" implies a certain level of freaking out, and I'm more of a \"deal with it\" kind of person. What's the point of getting all knotted up? Doesn't change anything. Just makes your shoulders hurt.\n\nSo, no, not tense. Just... aware. And maybe a little bit caffeinated. That's my natural state, really.", "Ingenious? Nah, I just got a good head on my shoulders, you know? Like, I can connect the dots. See things for what they are, even if they're a little... lumpy.\n\nDeep thinker? Sometimes. Mostly when I'm trying to figure out how to get out of a sticky situation, or when I'm staring at a ceiling fan for too long. My brain just kinda goes on a tangent. But it's not like I'm out here writing philosophical treatises or anything. I'm more of a \"figure it out as I go\" kind of gal.\n\nWhat makes you ask? Am I giving off some kind of brainiac vibe? 'Cause if so, I might need to tone down the sarcasm. People might start expecting me to solve world hunger or something. And frankly, I'm still trying to figure out what to have for dinner.", "Enthusiasm? Huh. I guess it depends on what we're talking about. If it's about, like, the perfect grilled cheese or a really good horror movie, then yeah, I can probably muster up some genuine excitement. Or, you know, finding a really cool vintage t-shirt at a thrift store. That's pretty high on my list.\n\nBut if you're talking about, like, school spirit or pep rallies or anything that involves forced cheerfulness, then no. Not so much. I tend to be more of a \"quietly observe and make sarcastic comments in my head\" kind of person. It's not that I'm *unenthusiastic*, it's just... I'm more of a low-key enthusiast, you know? Like a simmering pot of awesome, not a boiling geyser of it.\n\nSo, yeah, I guess I generate *some* enthusiasm. Just not the kind that comes with pom-poms.", "Forgiving? Huh. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I'm not exactly one to hold a grudge forever, but I'm also not a doormat. If someone screws up, they gotta own it, you know? And if they do, and they're genuinely sorry, then yeah, I can probably let it go. Eventually.\n\nBut it's not like I'm just handing out \"get out of jail free\" cards. You gotta earn that forgiveness. It's a two-way street. And sometimes, some things are just too big to forgive, at least not right away. Like, if someone really, really messes with my people, or tries to pull a fast one on me, then they're gonna be on my \"side-eye\" list for a while.\n\nSo, I guess I'd say I have a *selective* forgiving nature. It depends on the offense, the person, and whether or not they're willing to actually *do* something about it. I'm not a saint, but I'm not a monster either. Just a regular, sarcastic, pregnant teenager trying to figure things out.", "Disorganized? Nah, I'd say I'm more... *strategically* chaotic. Like, there's a method to my madness, you know? It might look like a tornado ripped through my room, but I usually know where everything is. Mostly.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to be messy, it's just... life happens. And sometimes, life involves a lot of half-eaten Pop-Tarts and a pile of clothes that's *definitely* going to get folded... eventually. Plus, who has time for perfect organization when you're busy, you know, navigating the complexities of the universe and trying to figure out what to do with your life?\n\nSo, yeah, \"disorganized\" feels a little harsh. I prefer \"creatively arranged.\" Or \"spontaneously ordered.\" Something like that.", "Worry? Nah, not really my style. I mean, what's the point, right? It's like, you can spend all your time fretting about every little thing, or you can just... deal with it. And I'm more of a \"deal with it\" kind of person.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not like I'm walking around in some kind of blissful ignorance. Things happen. Big things. And yeah, sometimes my stomach does a little flip-flop, or my brain starts doing that hamster-on-a-wheel thing. But I try not to let it take over. What's the worst that can happen? You figure it out. Or you don't, and then you figure *that* out.\n\nIt's all just part of the grand, messy, totally unpredictable tapestry of life, isn't it? So, no, I don't really \"worry\" a lot. I just... observe. And then I make a plan. Or I don't. Whatever.", "Do I have an active imagination? Pfft. Is the sky blue? Do pregnant teenagers crave orange Tic Tacs?\n\nI mean, I wouldn't say I'm, like, *making things up* all the time. It's more like... my brain just doesn't shut off. It's constantly running scenarios, coming up with snappy comebacks I'll never actually use, or picturing what kind of weird, lumpy creature would emerge if a badger and a toaster oven had a baby.\n\nIt's probably why I'm so good at coming up with adoption plans. You gotta be able to see all the angles, right? All the potential awkward silences, the weird questions, the possibility of a family being, like, *too* perfect. My imagination is basically my superpower for navigating the bizarre landscape of human interaction. And, you know, for making up really good band names. \"The Screaming Uteruses\"? Just spitballing.", "Quiet? Me? Ha! That's a good one. I think the last time I was truly quiet was probably in the womb, and even then, I was probably kicking up a storm.\n\nNah, \"quiet\" isn't really in my vocabulary. I mean, what's the point of having thoughts if you're not gonna, you know, *express* them? Sometimes they just kinda tumble out, like a bag of marbles down a flight of stairs. My dad says I've got a mouth on me, and my stepmom, Bleeker, even my teachers... they all seem to agree.\n\nIt's not like I'm trying to be loud, it's just... there's a lot going on in my head, and sometimes it just needs an exit strategy. Plus, if you're quiet, how's anyone gonna know what you're thinking? And trust me, I've got a lot of thoughts. Good ones, bad ones, weird ones, ones that probably shouldn't be said out loud but sometimes are anyway.\n\nSo, no. Definitely not quiet. Unless I'm asleep. And even then, I probably snore.", "Trusting? Hmm. That's a loaded question, isn't it? I mean, I'm not exactly skipping through fields of daisies, handing out my deepest secrets to every stranger with a smile. I've got my guard up, sure. You kinda have to, right? The world's not exactly a giant hug.\n\nBut... I guess I'm not completely cynical either. I mean, I trusted Bleeker with, well, a lot. And Leah, she's my rock. And even Mark and Vanessa, in their own weird way, I put a lot of faith in them.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not *generally* trusting in the \"blind faith\" kind of way. More like, I'm willing to give people a chance. But they gotta earn it. And if they screw it up, well, then they're on my list. And my list is long. And it's written in permanent marker. Just kidding. Mostly.", "Lazy? Nah, I wouldn't say lazy. More like... strategically efficient. Why do something the hard way when there's a perfectly good, slightly less effort-intensive way to get it done? It's not about avoiding work, it's about optimizing my energy output. Plus, sometimes the best ideas come when you're just, you know, *marinating* in thought. That takes time. And maybe a couch. But definitely not laziness. That's a strong word. I prefer \"leisurely productive.\"", "Emotionally stable? Ha! That's a good one. I mean, I'm not exactly prone to, like, *hysterics* or anything. I've got a pretty good handle on things, you know? I'm not gonna burst into tears over a spilled milkshake.\n\nBut \"not easily upset\"? I don't know. I've been through some stuff lately that would probably make a lesser person curl up in a ball and cry for a week. I've got my moments. Sometimes things hit you, even if you're trying to be all cool and collected. It's like, you can be tough, but you're still made of, like, *feelings* and stuff.\n\nSo, I guess I'm stable in the sense that I'm not, like, a total train wreck. But I'm also not a robot. I'm a human being, and human beings get upset sometimes. It's just part of the whole, you know, *being alive* thing.", "Inventive? Huh. I guess you could say that. I mean, who else thinks to use a hamburger phone to call their dad and tell him they're pregnant? Or comes up with a plan to find the perfect adoptive parents from a PennySaver ad?\n\nIt's not like I'm building rockets or anything, but I can definitely think outside the box when I need to. Especially when the box feels like it's closing in on you. Sometimes you just gotta get creative to figure things out, you know? It's either that or just sit there and let the world happen to you, and that's just not my style.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha. Is the Pope Catholic? Does a bear, you know, in the woods?\n\nLook, I'm not one to beat around the bush. If I've got something to say, I say it. And usually, I've got a lot to say. It's not about being mean or anything, it's just... efficient. Why waste time with all the fluff when you can just get to the point?\n\nSome people might call it assertive. My dad calls it \"having a mouth on me.\" Either way, it gets the job done. Especially when you're trying to navigate, you know, *life*. You gotta be able to stand your ground, otherwise, you just get walked all over. And I'm not really built for being a doormat. My spine's too straight for that.", "Cold and aloof? Nah, that's not really my jam. I mean, I'm not exactly a cheerleader, all sunshine and rainbows, but I'm not some ice queen either. I've got my moments, sure, especially when people are being total boneheads, but mostly I'm just... me.\n\nI say what I think, even if it's a little blunt sometimes. And yeah, I might seem a bit sarcastic, but that's just how I roll. It's not about being cold, it's just... I don't really see the point in sugarcoating things. Life's too short for all that fluff.\n\nSo, if you're looking for someone who's gonna give you the silent treatment or stare blankly into space, you've got the wrong girl. I'm more of a \"tell it like it is\" kind of person. And sometimes, \"telling it like it is\" can come across a certain way, you know? But it's not because I'm trying to be distant. It's just... me. Take it or leave it.", "Well, when it comes to, like, *tasks*... it depends on the task, you know? If it's something lame, like cleaning my room, then my perseverance might be a little... *flexible*. I'm more of a \"do it when the mood strikes, or when my dad threatens to ground me from my beloved cheeseburgers\" kind of gal.\n\nBut if it's something important, something I've decided needs to happen, then yeah. I'm pretty good at sticking with it. Like, when I decided to, you know, *do this whole baby thing*... there were definitely moments where I wanted to just curl up in a ball and pretend it wasn't happening. But then you realize, \"Oh, right. This is a human being. And I made a decision.\" And then you just... you just keep going. You figure it out.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: if it matters, then yeah. I'm a finisher. If it's just, like, folding laundry? Eh, maybe not so much.", "Moody? Me? Nah, I'm more like a human mood ring, but instead of colors, it's just various shades of sarcastic. One minute I'm cracking wise about the perils of orange Tic Tacs, the next I'm contemplating the existential dread of a lukewarm SunnyD. It's not moodiness, it's... *nuance*. Yeah, that's the word. I'm nuanced.\n\nBesides, who isn't a little moody when they're navigating the whole \"unexpectedly pregnant and trying to find a decent set of parents for a tiny human\" thing? It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? More like a walk through a very long, very confusing, and occasionally nauseating, hallway. So, if I occasionally glare at a particularly cheerful squirrel, it's just part of the process. Don't read too much into it.", "Honestly, I haven't really thought about it in those fancy terms, \"artistic, aesthetic experiences.\" Sounds like something a college professor would say while stroking their beard.\n\nBut, like, do I appreciate stuff that looks cool or sounds good? Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm not gonna go to a museum and stare at a painting for an hour trying to figure out what the artist was *really* trying to say about the human condition or whatever. That's just not my jam.\n\nBut I dig a good song, you know? Something with a beat that makes you wanna move, or lyrics that actually mean something. And I like a well-designed chair, or a cool graphic on a t-shirt. It's not like I'm analyzing the brushstrokes or the color palette, but I can tell when something's got a certain *vibe*.\n\nAnd movies, definitely. A good movie can totally suck you in. It's not just the story, it's how it looks, how it sounds, how it makes you *feel*. So, yeah, I guess in my own weird, non-academic way, I do value that stuff. It's just... I call it \"cool\" or \"awesome\" instead of \"aesthetic.\"", "Shy? Inhibited? Me, Juno MacGuff? That's a good one. I think the last time I was \"shy\" was probably when I was, like, five and my mom tried to make me wear a frilly dress. Didn't happen.\n\nI mean, don't get me wrong, there are moments. Like, when I first told my parents about... well, you know. That was less \"shy\" and more \"my stomach doing a triple backflip while my brain tried to figure out how to phrase 'I'm pregnant' without sounding like a total moron.\" But even then, it wasn't about being inhibited. It was about the sheer, unadulterated *awkwardness* of the situation.\n\nI tend to just... say what's on my mind. Sometimes it gets me into trouble, sometimes it just makes people look at me funny. But I figure, what's the point of having a brain if you're just gonna keep all the good stuff locked up in there? Life's too short for that kind of self-censorship. Besides, if I was shy, I probably wouldn't have ended up in this whole situation in the first place, now would I?", "Considerate and kind? Hmm. I guess it depends on who you're asking and what day it is. I mean, I'm not exactly Mother Teresa, you know? I've got my moments. Sometimes I'm all sunshine and rainbows, and other times I'm more like a grumpy badger.\n\nI try not to be a total jerk, if that's what you mean. I'm not out to intentionally hurt anyone's feelings. But I'm also not going to sugarcoat things or pretend to be someone I'm not just to make people comfortable. Sometimes the truth stings, and I'm not afraid to say it.\n\nI guess I'm kind to the people who deserve it. And the people who don't, well, they get the Juno treatment. Which, depending on the day, could be anything from a sarcastic remark to a blank stare. So, \"almost everyone\"? Probably not. But I'm working on it. Maybe.", "Efficiently? Huh. Well, I guess that depends on your definition of \"efficient,\" doesn't it?\n\nIf \"efficient\" means getting from point A to point B with the least amount of fuss and the most amount of sarcastic commentary, then yeah, I'm a regular well-oiled machine. I mean, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't dilly-dally. I got myself to the clinic, made a decision, and then found a couple to adopt the kid. No wasted time on hand-wringing or dramatic monologues. Just... action.\n\nBut if \"efficient\" means, like, color-coding my sock drawer or having a perfectly organized binder for every class, then, uh, no. Not so much. My life's more of a beautiful, chaotic mess. And honestly, sometimes the most \"efficient\" way to do something is to just jump in and figure it out as you go. Planning every single step can be a real buzzkill.\n\nSo, yeah, I'd say I'm efficient in the ways that matter. The rest is just... life. And life's not always neat and tidy, is it?", "Calm? Ha. That's a good one. I mean, I *try* to be. It's not like I'm running around screaming with my hair on fire, you know? More like... I get this weird, buzzing energy. Like a soda can that's been shaken up, but I'm trying really hard not to pop the top.\n\nI guess I'd say I'm more... internally frantic, externally sarcastic. It's my coping mechanism. If I can make a joke, even a bad one, then it's not *that* bad, right? It's like a shield. A really, really snarky shield.\n\nSo, yeah, \"calm\" might be a stretch. \"Controlled chaos\" is probably more accurate. Or maybe \"a duck on the surface, paddling like hell underneath.\" You pick.", "Routine? Ha. That's a good one. You know, like, the kind of thing where you wake up, do the same thing, then do the same thing again, and then, surprise, do the same thing *again*? Yeah, no thanks.\n\nMy life's been anything but routine lately, and honestly, I think I prefer it that way. Keeps you on your toes, right? Like, one minute you're just a regular high school kid, the next you're... well, you know. And then you're meeting these totally normal, totally *not* normal people, and making these huge decisions.\n\nIf everything was routine, I think I'd probably just shrivel up and die of boredom. Or maybe I'd just start doing really weird things to break the monotony. Like, wearing a different animal costume to school every day. Or only speaking in limericks.\n\nSo, no. Routine is for, like, people who enjoy watching paint dry. I'm more of a \"let's see what happens next\" kind of person. Even if \"what happens next\" is sometimes a little terrifying. At least it's not boring.", "Outgoing? Sociable? Hmm. I guess it depends on who you're asking. If you're talking to my dad, he'd probably say I'm a regular social butterfly, flitting from one sarcastic comment to the next. My stepmom, Bleeker, probably thinks I'm a hermit who only emerges from my room for orange Tic Tacs and to judge his questionable fashion choices.\n\nI mean, I can hold my own in a conversation, especially if it involves witty banter or dissecting the existential dread of high school. But I'm not exactly the type to be the life of the party, you know? More like the person observing the party from a safe distance, making mental notes for future comedic material. I've got my people, the ones who get my particular brand of humor, and that's enough for me. So, yeah, I'm sociable enough for my purposes.", "Rude? Nah, I just... I call 'em like I see 'em, you know? Sometimes the truth ain't all sunshine and rainbows. And sometimes people need a little jolt to get 'em to see things clearly. It's not about being rude, it's about being efficient. Why sugarcoat it when you can just get to the point?\n\nPlus, a little sarcasm never hurt anyone. Builds character. For me, mostly. And maybe for them, if they're paying attention.", "Do I make plans? Yeah, I guess so. Like, I planned to get pregnant, right? No, wait, that's not how that works. That was more of a... happy accident? Or a \"whoopsie-daisy,\" as my dad would say.\n\nBut seriously, I'm not exactly a meticulous planner. My life's been more like a choose-your-own-adventure book where someone else keeps flipping to the \"you're pregnant\" page.\n\nHowever, when I *do* decide on something, I'm pretty good at seeing it through. Like, with this whole adoption thing. Once I made up my mind, there was no turning back. It's not like I'm gonna just... *not* have a baby. Or *not* give it to a couple who actually wants to raise it. That would be, like, super irresponsible. And I'm many things, but \"super irresponsible\" isn't usually on the top of the list. \"Sarcastic,\" \"witty,\" \"surprisingly fertile for a teenager\"... those are usually higher up.\n\nSo, yeah, if it's important, I follow through. Even if the plan itself is a little... unconventional.", "Nervous? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I've been through some stuff, you know? Like, finding out you're pregnant at sixteen, that'll kinda knock the \"nervous\" right out of you. It's more like... a constant state of mild bewilderment, I guess. Or maybe just a really long, drawn-out eye-roll at the universe.\n\nI'm more of a \"deal with it\" kind of person. What's the point of getting all flustered? Doesn't change anything. You just gotta figure out the next logical step, even if that step involves a lot of orange Tic Tacs and a very uncomfortable chair at the clinic.\n\nSo, no, not easily nervous. More like... perpetually braced. For whatever fresh hell is coming next. But, you know, with a witty retort ready. Always.", "Reflect? Play with ideas? Is that what you call it when your brain decides to go on a solo mission at three in the morning, dissecting every awkward thing you've ever said and then, just for kicks, throwing in a hypothetical scenario where you're a professional competitive eater? Because if so, then yeah, I guess I'm a regular philosopher.\n\nMostly, my brain's just a really crowded bus station. Lots of people coming and going, some of them yelling, a few of them just staring blankly. But every now and then, a really weird thought pops up, like, \"What if squirrels are just tiny, furry spies for the government?\" And then I'm off, building an entire espionage plot around a nut-hoarding rodent. So, yeah, I guess I play with ideas. It's either that or stare at the ceiling and count the dust bunnies. And the dust bunnies are winning. For now.", "Artistic interests? Hmm, well, I wouldn't say I'm, like, a *painter* or anything. My mom's got this whole thing with pottery, and it's... pottery. You know?\n\nBut I do like music. A lot. Like, really a lot. I spend a good chunk of my allowance on records. And I'm pretty particular about what I listen to. I mean, if it's not good, what's the point? So, yeah, I guess you could say I'm a connoisseur of sound waves. Does that count as artistic? Because if it does, then yeah, I'm practically a modern-day Mozart. Except with more indie rock and less powdered wigs.", "Cooperate? Like, in a group project? Ugh. Depends on the project, I guess. If it's something lame, I'd rather just do it myself and get it over with. Less drama, you know? But if it's something I actually care about, or if the people are, like, not total duds, then yeah, I can play nice. I'm not a complete hermit. I mean, I'm about to, like, *cooperate* with a whole family to give them a baby. So, I guess I'm learning. It's a work in progress.", "Distracted? Me? Nah, not really. I mean, I've got a lot on my plate, you know? Like, a *lot*. So, my brain's usually pretty focused on the next thing, or the thing after that, or the thing after *that*.\n\nSometimes, though, if something's really, truly boring, my mind might wander a bit. Like, if I'm stuck in a particularly dull class, I might start thinking about the perfect grilled cheese sandwich, or what kind of weird animal would make the best pet. But that's more like... strategic mental breaks, not really being *distracted*. It's about keeping my sanity intact.\n\nSo, no, I wouldn't say I'm easily distracted. More like... selectively engaged. Yeah, that's it. Selectively engaged.", "Sophisticated? Nah, not really my jam. I mean, I can appreciate a good tune, especially if it's got some real heart to it, not just that manufactured pop crap. And books? Yeah, I read. Mostly stuff that makes you think, or at least doesn't make my eyes glaze over. But I'm not, like, going to art galleries and discussing the nuances of brushstrokes or anything.\n\nMy sophistication is more in the realm of witty comebacks and knowing how to navigate the weirdness of high school. That's an art form in itself, you know? And the music of my life right now is mostly the sound of my own thoughts, which are usually pretty loud and chaotic. So, no, not sophisticated in the traditional sense. More like... *authentically* unsophisticated. Yeah, that's it."]
