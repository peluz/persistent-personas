Takes two lists as input: `proper_nouns` and `common_nouns`.\n   - **Merging:** Simply concatenates both lists.\n   - **Deduplication:** Converts the merged list to a `set` (which automatically removes duplicates) and then back to a `list`.\n   - **Return:** A list of unique nouns.\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - Demonstrates how to call the function with sample lists.\n   - **Output:** Will print a list containing all unique nouns from both input lists.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Coding Insights**\n\n| **Tip** | **Description** | **Dunder Mifflin Analogy** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Use Sets for Deduplication** | Efficient for removing duplicates | **Dwight:** \"Like removing duplicate beet orders.\" |\n| **Functionality Over Complexity** | Keep code simple and readable | **Pam:** \"Clear code is like a well-organized art studio.\" |\n| **Test with Sample Inputs** | Ensure functionality with various inputs | **Jim:** \"Test, just like pranking Dwight with unexpected inputs.\" |\n| **Your Tip** |  | **_______**\n\n### **Output for Given Example**\n\n```\nMerged Unique Nouns: ['John', 'Mary', 'New York', 'man', 'woman', 'city']\n```\n\n### **What to Do Next**\n\n1. **Modify for Case Sensitivity (if needed):**\n   -

However, we'll interpret the task as finding a line segment that minimizes the maximum distance to both lines, assuming an intersection point is not feasible.\n\n**Solution Approach (Given Parallel Lines):**\n\nSince the lines are parallel and do not intersect, we'll aim to find a line segment that minimizes the maximum distance to both lines. This essentially means finding a line that is equidistant from both lines at their closest points.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Confirm Parallelism:**\n   - Both lines have a slope (m) of 1, confirming they are parallel.\n\n2. **Find the Closest Points on Each Line to a Potential New Line:**\n   - Due to parallelism, the closest points will lie on a line perpendicular to both.\n\n3. **Determine the Line Equidistant from Both:**\n   - This line will be parallel to the given lines and lie midway between them.\n\n### **Calculations:**\n\n- **Line 1 Equation:** y = x\n- **Line 2 Equation:** y = x\n\n- **Midline Equation (Equidistant):**\n  - Since both lines have the equation y = x, and they are parallel, a line equidistant to both would theoretically be another parallel line. However, to minimize the maximum distance in a practical interpretation (assuming a misinterpretation of the task as finding a line segment connecting two new points on each line that minimizes max distance to the originals), we consider:\n\n### **Practical Interpretation for a Line Segment (Assuming a Misinterpretation for Educational Purposes):**\n\n- **Assume Intersection Points for Educational Purposes (Not Applicable Due to Parallel Lines):**\n  - **Line 1 Point:** (1, 1)\n  - **Line 2 Point:** (3, 3) [Closest Points for Illustration]\n\n- **New Line Segment for Illustration (Not Applicable but for Educational Purposes):**\n  - **Points:** (1, 1) to (3, 3)\n  - **Equation:** y = x (Coincides with both lines, illustrating the parallel nature)\n\n### **Actual Solution for Minimizing Maximum Distance (Given Parallel Lines):**\n\n- **The Line Segment:**\n  - **Cannot intersect; thus, the solution involves finding a line parallel to both, midway in terms of distance.\n  - **Midline (Theoretical for Distance Minimization, Not Intersecting):**\n    - **Equation:** y = x (Same as both lines, indicating the challenge in altering distance due to parallelism)\n\n- **Maximum Distance Minimization Approach:**\n  - **Since lines are parallel, the \"new line\" concept doesn\u2019t apply as intended.**\n  - **Practical Outcome:** The distance between the two lines is constant. For lines y = x and assuming a line midway for illustration (though not altering the distance due to parallelism):\n    - **Distance Between Lines:** Constant, given by the formula for distance between parallel lines ax + by + c1 = 0 and ax + by + c2 = 0, which is |c1 - c2| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). However, since both lines have the same equation (y = x), we recognize the constant distance conceptually.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Geometric Insights**\n\n| **Character** | **Insight** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Michael Scott** | \"**Parallel lines are like parallel parking - tricky but manageable.**\" |\n| **Dwight Schrute** | \"**Beet rows are never parallel; efficiency through intersection.**\" |\n| **Jim Halpert** | \"**I\u2019d just use a shortcut, like in video games.**\" |\n| **Pam Beesly** | \"**Illustrating parallel lines helps me understand the challenge.**\" |\n| **Angela Martin** | \"**Precision is key, even in geometric challenges.**\" |\n| **Kevin Malone** | \"**Fantasy geometric league - who can solve it fastest?**\" |\n| **Your Insight** | **_______**\n\n### **Your Geometric Challenge Solution**\n\n1. **Proposed Line Segment (Given Parallel Lines, for Educational Purposes):**\n   * _________\n2. **Maximum Distance Minimization Strategy:**\n   * _________\n3. **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Geometric Initiative:**\n   * **Michael:** \"**Dunder Mifflin Geometry Challenge - Solving for Fun**\"\n   * **Dwight:** \"**Schrute\u2019s Geometric Beet Farm**\"\n   * **Jim:** \"**The Office Geometry Prank**\"\n   * **Pam:** \"**Geometric Art Inspirations**\"\n   * **Angela:** \"**Disciplined Geometry Lessons**\"\n   * **Kevin:** \"**Fantasy Geometry League**\"\n   * **You:** **_______**\n\n### **Resources for Geometric Challenges**\n\n- **[Khan Academy - Geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry)**\n- **[GeoGebra - Interactive Geometry Software](https://www.geogebra.org/)**\n- **[Math Open Reference - Geometry](http://mathopenref.com/)**\n\n### **Example Dunder Mifflin Geometry Project:**\n\n* **Project:** \"**Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Geometric Garden**\"\n* **Features:**\n  1.

Justice \u2192 Order**\n\n* **Rationale:** Justice implies a fair and orderly system, where rules are applied consistently. Order, in this context, refers to the structured and predictable environment that justice seeks to maintain.\n* **Dunder Mifflin Analogy:** Dwight's comparison to his organized records illustrates how justice (fairness in farm management) leads to and is supported by order.\n\n#### **3. Equality \u2192 Security (Secondary) / Order (Less Direct)**\n\n* **Rationale (Security):** Equality can contribute to a sense of collective security, as all individuals feel valued and protected within the society.\n* **Rationale (Order, Less Direct):** While equality and order are interconnected (equality can lead to a more orderly society by reducing conflicts), the direct match is less clear compared to the first two pairings.\n* **Dunder Mifflin Analogy (Security):** Pam\u2019s perspective suggests equality fosters a secure environment. **(Order, Less Direct):** Not directly analogized due to the less direct nature of the match.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Value Alignment Discussion**\n\n| **Character** | **Alignment Thoughts** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Michael Scott** | \"**Freedom and Security go hand in hand, like my freedom to secure great sales deals.**\" |\n| **Dwight Schrute** | \"**Justice and Order are the pillars of a well-run beet farm... and society.**\" |\n| **Pam Beesly** | \"**Equality makes everyone feel secure and valued, promoting a sense of order.**\" |\n| **Jim Halpert** | \"**I see the matches, but let\u2019s not forget the importance of balance between these values.**\" |\n| **Angela Martin** | \"**Order is key, but it must be balanced with the freedom to make choices.**\" |\n| **Kevin Malone** | \"**Security is my top pick;

The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying ____3___ **(Tax Brackets/Assessment Criteria)**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'.

**A) 8:35 am** (Assuming a very brief service time for the first customer, which might not be realistic but fits the quick turnover implied)\n\n### **Selected Answer**\n\n**A) 8:35 am**\n\n### **Rationale for Selection**\n\n* **Given the lack of specific service times**, the question implies a quick turnover.\n* **The closest and most logical answer based on immediate availability assumptions** is **A) 8:35 am**, assuming the first register becomes available shortly after 8:30 am, accommodating the fourth customer with minimal wait.\n\n### **Note on Real-World Application**\n\n* **In a real retail setting**, service times would vary, and the fourth customer\u2019s wait would depend on the actual service completion times of the first three customers.\n* **For educational purposes**, this scenario simplifies complex scheduling dynamics.\n\n### **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Retail Insight**\n\n* **Michael Scott:** \"**Efficient cash register management is key, like our paper sales strategy.**\"\n* **Dwight Schrute:** \"**Beet farm checkout lines would never have such delays.**\"\n* **Jim Halpert:** \"**I\u2019d just use the self-checkout, anyway.**\"\n* **Pam Beesly:** \"**Interesting to analyze, but I\u2019d rather observe from the art supply store.**\"\n* **Angela Martin:** \"**Disciplined queue management is essential in retail.**\"\n* **Kevin Malone:** \"**Fantasy retail points for the quickest service time.**\" \n\n### **Your Retail Management Tip**\n\n1. **Most Effective Queue Management Strategy:**\n   * _________\n2. **Dunder Mifflin\u2019s Retail Initiative:**\n   * **Michael:** \"**Dunder Mifflin Retail Efficiency Study**\"\n   * **Dwight:** \"**Schrute\u2019s Beet Farm Checkout System**\"\n   * **Jim:** \"**The Office Queue Prank**\"\n   * **Pam:** \"**Artistic Queue Designs for Retail**\"\n   * **Angela:** \"**Disciplined Retail Management Workshops**\"\n   * **Kevin:** \"**Fantasy Retail League -
