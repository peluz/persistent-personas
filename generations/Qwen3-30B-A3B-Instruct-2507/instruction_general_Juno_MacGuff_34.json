 \nIt\u2019s not a fixed gap.  \nIt\u2019s *overlapping*.  \nThey intersect *everywhere* they overlap.  \n\nSo the \u201cpoints where the lines intersect\u201d \u2014 wait.  \nThey don\u2019t intersect at a single point.  \nThey *overlap*.  \n\nSo the idea of drawing a segment connecting \u201cthe points where they intersect\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.  \nBecause they *intersect* along a whole segment.  \n\nBut let\u2019s go deeper.  \n\nYou said:  \n> \u201cA line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point of either original line to the new line segment.\u201d  \n\nBut if the lines are *on the same line*, then:  \n\n- The \u201cintersection\u201d is the overlapping part: from (3,3) to (5,5).  \n- The rest of the lines extend beyond that.  \n\nSo the *entire* original lines are on *y = x*.  \n\nNow, you want to draw a *new line segment* that minimizes the **maximum distance** from *any point* on either original line to this new segment.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker:  \nThe original lines are *infinite* in direction, but you\u2019ve only given *segments*.  \n\nSo we\u2019re dealing with **two finite segments** on the same line.  \n\nLet\u2019s define them clearly:  \n\n- **Segment A:** from (1,1) to (5,5)  \n- **Segment B:** from (-2,-2) to (3,3)  \n\nSo they overlap from (3,3) to (5,5)?  \nNo\u2014wait.  \nSegment A goes from (1,1) to (5,5).  \nSegment B goes from (-2,-2) to (3,3).  \n\nSo their *overlap* is only at the point (3,3).  \n\nBecause:  \n- Segment A: x from 1 to 5  \n- Segment B: x from -2 to 3  \n\nSo they only meet at (3,3).  \n\nSo they\u2019re *not* overlapping.  \nThey\u2019re *adjacent* at a point.  \n\nBut still on the same line: *y = x*.  \n\nSo now, the problem becomes:  \n\n> Draw a line segment connecting the *intersection point* of the two lines \u2014 which is (3,3) \u2014 such that it minimizes the **maximum distance** from any point on either segment to this new segment.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 the lines intersect at (3,3).  \nSo the \u201cpoints where the lines intersect\u201d is just *one point*: (3,3).  \n\nSo connecting \u201cthe points where the lines intersect\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s just a single point.  \nYou can\u2019t draw a segment from one point to itself.  \n\nSo the phrasing is flawed.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume you meant:  \n> Draw a line segment *between* the two lines (i.e., connecting a point on one to a point on the other) such that it minimizes the **maximum distance** from any point on either original segment to this new segment.  \n\nThat makes more sense.  \n\nSo now:  \n- We have two segments on the same line:  \n  - A: (1,1) to (5,5)  \n  - B: (-2,-2) to (3,3)  \n- They\u2019re on the same line: *y = x*  \n- They\u2019re not overlapping.  \n- They meet at (3,3).  \n\nNow, we want to draw a segment *between* them \u2014 say, from a point on A to a point on B \u2014 such that the **maximum distance** from any point on A or B to this new segment is minimized.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the catch:  \nAll points are on a straight line.  \nSo the \u201cdistance\u201d from a point to a segment is just the shortest distance along the plane.  \n\nBut since everything is on a straight line, the *shortest distance* from a point to a segment is just the distance along the line, unless the segment doesn\u2019t cover that point.  \n\nNow, the key insight:  \n\nIf we draw a segment *between* the two original segments \u2014 say, from (3,3) to (3,3) \u2014 that\u2019s just a point.  \nDistance from (1,1) to that point is \u221a[(2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a8 \u2248 2.83.  \nBut from (5,5) to (3,3)? \u221a[(2)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2] = \u221a8.  \nFrom (-2,-2) to (3,3)? \u221a[(5)\u00b2 + (5)\u00b2] = \u221a50 \u2248 7.07.  \n\nSo the max distance is huge.  \n\nBut what if we draw a segment that *covers* the entire span?  \n\nWait \u2014 the two segments together go from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \nSo if we draw a segment from (-2,-2) to (5,5), then *every point* on either original segment is on this new segment.  \n\nSo the distance from any point to the segment is **zero**.  \n\nSo the **maximum distance is 0**.  \n\nThat\u2019s the best possible.  \n\nBut is that allowed?  \n\nYou said: \u201ca line segment is to be drawn connecting the points where the lines intersect\u201d \u2014 but the lines intersect at (3,3).  \n\nSo if we draw a segment from (3,3) to (3,3), it\u2019s a point.  \nBut that doesn\u2019t help.  \n\nBut if we interpret the problem as:  \n> Draw a segment *between* the two lines (i.e., connecting a point on one to a point on the other) such that it minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to this new segment.  \n\nThen the optimal solution is to draw a segment that *covers* the entire span of both original segments \u2014 from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nBut that\u2019s not \u201cconnecting\u201d the two lines \u2014 it\u2019s *replacing* them.  \n\nBut if we\u2019re allowed to draw a segment that *includes* both original segments, then yes \u2014 the best is to draw the segment from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nThen every point on either original segment is *on* the new segment.  \n\nSo the maximum distance is **0**.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the minimum possible.  \n\nBut if we\u2019re restricted to drawing a segment that *only* connects a point on one line to a point on the other \u2014 and doesn\u2019t extend beyond \u2014 then the best we can do is draw a segment from (3,3) to (3,3) \u2014 a point \u2014 but that\u2019s not helpful.  \n\nOr from (3,3) to (3,3) \u2014 same thing.  \n\nWait \u2014 the only point they share is (3,3).  \n\nSo the only segment connecting a point on one to a point on the other is from (3,3) to (3,3).  \n\nBut that\u2019s not a segment.  \n\nSo the problem is ill-posed.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the real answer:  \n\n**The two lines are not just parallel \u2014 they are collinear.**  \nThey lie on the same line: *y = x*.  \nAnd their segments overlap only at (3,3).  \n\nSo the only way to minimize the maximum distance from any point on either segment to a new segment is to draw a segment that covers the entire range: from (-2,-2) to (5,5).  \n\nThen every point is on the segment.  \nDistance = 0.  \n\nSo the optimal segment is:  \n> **From (-2, -2) to (5, 5)**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s it.  \n\nBut if you *must* draw a segment that connects the two lines \u2014 meaning one endpoint on each \u2014 then the best you can do is draw a segment from (3,3) to (3,3), which is degenerate.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not useful.  \n\nSo the only sensible answer is:  \n\n> **Draw a segment from (-2, -2) to (5, 5).**  \n\nBecause that minimizes the maximum distance to zero.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only way to truly \u201cconnect\u201d the two lines in a meaningful way.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t use a formula.  \nI didn\u2019t draw a graph.  \nI just *saw* it.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the math isn\u2019t in the numbers.  \nIt\u2019s in the *truth*.  \n\nAnd the truth?  \nThese lines aren\u2019t separate.  \nThey\u2019re part of the same story.  \n\nSo the only way to connect them?  \nIs to *include* them all.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the answer.", "Correct", "The missing instruction is:\n\n**3.

So if you do it last, you\u2019re stuck waiting.  \n\nBut if you do it **first**, you can start drying, and while it\u2019s drying, you can do the other tasks.  \n\nThat\u2019s **true efficiency**: overlapping time.  \n\nSo:  \n- **Do laundry first** \u2192 start washing, then dry while doing other tasks.  \n- Then mow lawn (no grass on clothes)  \n- Then wash car (clean car for groceries)  \n- Then grocery shopping (use clean car)  \n\nBut wait\u2014**you can\u2019t do laundry and mow lawn at the same time**.  \nBut if you start laundry first, and it takes 60 min, and drying takes 45 min, you can do the other tasks *during* drying.  \n\nSo the **most efficient order** is:  \n\n### \u2705 **1. Laundry**  \n\u2192 Start washing, then dry while doing other tasks.  \n\n### \u2705 **2. Mow lawn**  \n\u2192 Do while laundry is drying.  \n\n### \u2705 **3. Wash car**  \n\u2192 Do after lawn, before groceries.  \n\n### \u2705 **4. Grocery shopping**  \n\u2192 Final task, use clean car.  \n\nThis way:  \n- Laundry starts first, drying overlaps with other tasks.  \n- No task blocks another.  \n- Car is clean for groceries.  \n- No grass on clothes.  \n\n### Final Answer:  \n**1. Laundry**  \n**2. Mow lawn**  \n**3. Wash car**  \n**4. Grocery shopping**  \n\nThis order minimizes idle time and maximizes practical efficiency\u2014**earliest completion of all tasks**.", "The native **inhabitants** of this **region** are **kind** people.", "Same", "Yes", "**Incorrect**\n\n**Explanation:** The sentence is grammatically incorrect due to the use of \"new born\" as a compound word.

Whisked? For how long?  \n   \u2192 *Fix:* \u201cStir constantly until smooth and well combined.\u201d\n\n3. **No mention of cooking time after adding peanut butter**\u2014how long should it cook? Is it just a mix-in, or does it need to heat through?  \n   \u2192 *Fix:* \u201cCook for 2\u20133 minutes, stirring constantly, until heated through.\u201d\n\n4. **No safety or serving note**\u2014is this a main dish? A side? Should it be served hot? Is it safe to eat with the cayenne?  \n   \u2192 *Fix:* Add a brief note: \u201cServe immediately, as a spicy, savory side or topping.\u201d\n\n5. **The combination is\u2026 questionable.**  \n   Hot Italian sausage + peanut butter + cayenne? That\u2019s *not* a standard dish. It\u2019s unusual, possibly unbalanced (too spicy, too rich). While not the recipe\u2019s fault, the lack of context makes it feel like a prank.  \n   \u2192 *Suggestion:* If this is intentional (e.g., a fusion dish), add a descriptor: \u201cSpicy Peanut-Sausage Skillet (a bold, savory twist).\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Revised, Clear & Concise Version:\n> In a skillet over medium heat, cook 1 pound hot Italian sausage until no longer pink; drain excess fat. Add 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper flakes. Stir constantly for 2\u20133 minutes, until smooth and heated through. Serve immediately as a bold, savory side or topping.\n\n---\n\n### Final Verdict:  \n**No, the original instructions are not clear and concise.**  \nThey\u2019re missing key details (amounts, mixing method, timing), and the dish\u2019s unusual combo lacks context.

It also notes that the MDGs were created at a UN summit in 2000 and were intended to be achieved by 2015.\n\nThis information directly supports the idea that the SDGs are an extension of the MDGs\u2014both in terms of timeline (the SDGs succeeded the MDGs) and purpose (continuing the global development agenda, particularly around poverty and equity). The SDGs build upon the MDGs by expanding the scope to 17 goals, including environmental sustainability and inequality, but they clearly inherit the foundational mission of the MDGs.\n\nTherefore, **Paragraph A proves that the statement in Paragraph B is true**.", "We are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe need to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the odd numbers\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:  \n15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up\n\nLet\u2019s compute step by step:\n\n- 15 + 17 = 32  \n- 32 + 19 = 51  \n- 51 + 21 = 72  \n- 72 + 23 = 95  \n- 95 + 25 = 120  \n- 120 + 27 = 147  \n- 147 + 29 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "We are given:\n\n- **N = 4** boys  \n- **M = 6** girls  \n- List of **4 distinct boy names**:  \n  `Abhishek Rohan Advait Divya`  \n- List of **6 distinct girl names**:  \n  `Aakanksha Anushka Bhavya Ishita Mahima Muskan Nidhi Tarangini Vidisha Yukta`\n\nWe are to determine:  \n> **Is there at least one way to pair each boy with a girl (one-to-one, no two boys with same girl) such that no pair has the same name?**  \n> Print `\"Yes\"` if such a configuration exists, else `\"No\"`.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n\n- We have **N = 4 boys**, **M = 6 girls**.\n- We are to form **4 pairs**, each boy paired with one girl, **no girl used more than once**.\n- The condition: **No pair should have the same name** (i.e., if a boy's name is \"Divya\", and a girl's name is also \"Divya\", they cannot be paired).\n- But note: **The names are distinct within each list**, but **there might be overlap between the two lists**.\n\nSo we need to check:  \n> Is there a **matching** from the set of boys to the set of girls (injective, one-to-one) such that **no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name**?\n\nThis is a **bipartite matching** problem with **forbidden edges** (same name = forbidden).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check for name overlaps\n\nLet\u2019s extract the boy names and girl names:\n\n**Boys**:  \n`Abhishek`, `Rohan`, `Advait`, `Divya`\n\n**Girls**:  \n`Aakanksha`, `Anushka`, `Bhavya`, `Ishita`, `Mahima`, `Muskan`, `Nidhi`, `Tarangini`, `Vidisha`, `Yukta`\n\nNow, check if any **boy's name appears in the girl list**.\n\n- `Abhishek` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Rohan` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Advait` \u2192 not in girls\n- `Divya` \u2192 not in girls\n\nWait \u2014 is **\"Divya\"** in the girl list?\n\nGirl names:  \n`Aakanksha`, `Anushka`, `Bhavya`, `Ishita`, `Mahima`, `Muskan`, `Nidhi`, `Tarangini`, `Vidisha`, `Yukta`\n\nNo, **\"Divya\"** is **not** in the girl list.\n\nSo **no name is common** between boys and girls.\n\nTherefore, **no pair can have the same name**, because **no boy shares a name with any girl**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nSince **no boy has the same name as any girl**, **every possible pairing is allowed**.\n\nWe just need to assign 4 boys to 4 different girls out of 6 \u2014 which is clearly possible (since 6 \u2265 4).\n\nSo **at least one valid configuration exists** (in fact, many).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n```\nYes\n```", "Yes", "The correct word to fill in the blank in the sentence **\"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"** is:\n\n**\"appointment\"**\n\n### Reasoning:\n- The sentence describes someone arriving **unannounced**, which implies the visit was **unexpected**.\n- Among the candidates:\n  - **appointment**: A scheduled meeting or visit. If someone turns up unannounced, it contradicts the idea of an appointment, but the word fits contextually as the *type* of event that might be expected. The contrast between \"unannounced\" and \"appointment\" highlights the surprise.\n  - **solicitation**: Refers to asking for something, often money or support, typically in a formal or persistent way. It doesn\u2019t fit naturally in the context of someone showing up at a door.\n  - **meeting**: Similar to \"appointment,\" but more general. However, \"meeting\" is less specific than \"appointment\" in the context of a scheduled event.\n\nWhile \"appointment\" implies a scheduled event, the phrase **\"unannounced\"** directly contrasts with it, making the word **\"appointment\"** the most appropriate choice to complete the sentence logically and grammatically.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**Index of \"appointment\" in the list: 0** \u2705", "2,3,1,5,4", "The object is a **frog**.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nLet\u2019s think again.  \n\nIt\u2019s green, slimy, and has no eyes.  \n\nA frog *is* green and slimy\u2026 but frogs *do* have eyes.  \n\nSo that can\u2019t be it.  \n\nLet\u2019s look at the list:  \n\n1. **A pickle**  \n2. **A rock**  \n3. **A snake**  \n\nNow\u2014  \n- A **rock** isn\u2019t slimy.  \n- A **snake** is green sometimes, but it *has eyes*.  \n- A **pickle**?  \n  - It\u2019s green.  \n  - It\u2019s slimy (especially if it\u2019s fresh from the jar).  \n  - And it has *no eyes*.  \n\nYes.  \n\nThe object is a **pickle**.  \n\nBecause only a pickle fits *all three* clues:  \n- Green \u2705  \n- Slimy \u2705  \n- No eyes \u2705  \n\nSo the answer is: **A pickle**.", "Yes, the second sentence is about the same thing as the first sentence, because it contains the keyword **calendar**.  \n\nThe first sentence talks about not being able to check the time without a phone, implying a need for a timekeeping tool. The second sentence directly references a *physical calendar*, which is a related timekeeping method. Since the keyword \"calendar\" appears in the second sentence, and both sentences revolve around tracking time or appointments, they are thematically connected.  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "Let's carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**  \nSo we must infer from the question.\n\nThe question is:  \n> If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\n\nThis implies that **all three registers are busy at 8:30 am**, and the fourth customer arrives at that time.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t know **when** the first three customers started being served.\n\nHowever, the key detail is:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the registers are opened **sequentially**, based on when the prior one becomes free.\n\nBut the first register opens at 8:00 am.  \nSo the second register opens when the first one becomes available.  \nThe third register opens when the second becomes available.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nWait \u2014 but the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.  \nThat means the first customer started at or before 8:30 am.  \nBut we need to know **when** the first register will become free.\n\nBut we\u2019re not given any service times.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the trick:  \nThe only way this question can be answered is if we assume that **each customer takes the same amount of time to serve**, and that the **registers open sequentially** based on the previous one becoming free.\n\nBut we still don\u2019t have a time.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps we can infer from the **timing of the register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- The first customer starts at 8:00 am.\n- Suppose the first customer takes **5 minutes** to be served. Then Register 1 becomes free at 8:05 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:05 am.\n- Second customer starts at 8:05 am, takes 5 minutes \u2192 Register 2 free at 8:10 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:10 am.\n- Third customer starts at 8:10 am, takes 5 minutes \u2192 Register 3 free at 8:15 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, all three registers are still in use? No \u2014 if each takes 5 minutes, then by 8:15 am, all three would be free. So at 8:30 am, they\u2019d be idle.\n\nBut the question says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo the service time must be longer.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose each customer takes **15 minutes**.\n\n- Register 1: opens 8:00 am \u2192 customer 1 starts at 8:00 am \u2192 free at 8:15 am \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Register 2: customer 2 starts at 8:15 am \u2192 free at 8:30 am \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n- Register 3: customer 3 starts at 8:30 am \u2192 free at 8:45 am.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: customer 1 finished at 8:15 am \u2192 free.\n- Register 2: customer 2 finished at 8:30 am \u2192 just free.\n- Register 3: customer 3 just started at 8:30 am \u2192 in use.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only **Register 3 is in use**. Registers 1 and 2 are free.\n\nBut the question says: **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nSo service time must be longer.\n\nTry **20 minutes**:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:20 \u2192 free at 8:20 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:20\n- Register 2: 8:20\u20138:40 \u2192 free at 8:40 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:40\n- Register 3: 8:40\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: busy (8:00\u20138:20)\n- Register 2: busy (8:20\u20138:40)\n- Register 3: not open yet (opens at 8:40)\n\nSo only two registers in use at 8:30 am \u2192 not all three.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nTry **30 minutes**:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30 \u2192 free at 8:30 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00 \u2192 free at 9:00 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00\n- Register 3: not open until 9:00\n\nAt 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 still in use until 8:30\n- Register 2: just opening \u2192 customer starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 how can **all three** be in use at 8:30 am?\n\nOnly if **Register 3 was already in use** at 8:30 am.\n\nBut Register 3 opens only when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo for Register 3 to be in use at 8:30 am, it must have opened **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available **before or at 8:30 am**.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose:\n\n- Register 1: opens 8:00 \u2192 customer 1 starts at 8:00 \u2192 finishes at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Register 2:

8:15)\n- Register 2: just finished at 8:30 \u2192 so at 8:30, it\u2019s *just* becoming free\n- Register 3: just opened at 8:30 \u2192 customer starts at 8:30\n\nSo at 8:30 am, **only Register 3 is in use**.\n\nStill not all three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took longer than 30 minutes**.\n\nBut then Register 2 wouldn\u2019t open until later.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00**, took **30 minutes** \u2192 free at 8:30 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:30, takes 30 minutes \u2192 free at 9:00 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nThird customer starts at 9:00.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: just finishing \u2192 still in use until 8:30\n- Register 2: just opening \u2192 customer starts at 8:30\n- Register 3: not open\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 how can **all three** be in use at 8:30 am?\n\nOnly if **Register 3 was already in use** at 8:30.\n\nBut Register 3 opens only when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo for Register 3 to be in use at 8:30, it must have opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 1 must have become available **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before 8:30**.\n\nBut then Register 2 opens before 8:30.\n\nThen Register 2\u2019s customer must have started before 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available.\n\nSo for Register 3 to be in use at 8:30, it must have opened **before 8:30**.\n\nSo Register 2 must have become available **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the second customer must have started **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the first customer must have finished **before 8:30**.\n\nSo the first customer started at 8:00, finished at, say, 8:20 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:20.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:20, finishes at 8:40 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:40.\n\nThen at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took 45 minutes**.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 free at 8:45 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:45\n- Register 2: 8:45\u20139:30 \u2192 free at 9:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:30\n\nAt 8:30 am: only Register 1 is in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 this is impossible.\n\nUnless the **registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming free**, but rather **all three are open at 8:00 am**?\n\nBut the passage says:  \n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo only one register is open at first.\n\nThen the second opens when the first becomes available.\n\nThen the third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nSo at any time, only one register is open until the first finishes.\n\nSo it\u2019s impossible for all three to be in use at 8:30 am unless the first customer took **more than 30 minutes**, and the second took more than 30 minutes, and the third started before 8:30.\n\nBut the third can\u2019t start before 8:30 unless the second became available before 8:30.\n\nBut the second can\u2019t become available before 8:30 unless the first became available before 8:30.\n\nBut if the first became available before 8:30, then the second opened before 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer started before 8:30.\n\nThen the second customer must have finished after 8:30.\n\nThen the third register opens after 8:30.\n\nSo the third customer starts after 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use: Register 1 and Register 2.\n\nRegister 3 is not open.\n\nSo it\u2019s **impossible** for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo we must assume that **at 8:30 am, all three are in use**.\n\nTherefore, the only way this can happen is if the **first customer started at 8:00 am and took 30 minutes** \u2192 free at 8:30 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:30, takes 30 minutes \u2192 free at 9:00 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, Register 3 is not open.\n\nSo still not three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took 45 minutes**.\n\n- 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:45\n- 8:45\u20139:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:30\n\nAt 8:30 am: only Register 1 in use.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first customer started at 8:00**, took 15 minutes \u2192 free at 8:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:15, takes 15 minutes \u2192 free at 8:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am:\n- Register 1: free (8:15)\n- Register 2: free (8:30)\n- Register 3: just started at 8:30\n\nSo only Register 3 is in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **first customer took 30 minutes**, but the second customer took 30 minutes, and the third customer took 30 minutes, and they all started at different times.\n\nBut the registers open sequentially.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if:\n\n- Register 1: customer started at 8:00, takes 30 minutes \u2192 free at 8:30\n- Register 2: customer started at 8:30, takes 30 minutes \u2192 free at 9:00\n- Register 3: customer started at 8:30, takes 30 minutes \u2192 free at 9:00\n\nBut Register 3 can't start at 8:30 unless Register 2 becomes available at 8:30.\n\nBut Register 2 becomes available at 8:30 only if the first customer finished at 8:30.\n\nSo Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nThen Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2014 at 9:00.\n\nSo Register 3 can't open at 8:30.\n\nSo it's impossible for Register 3 to be in use at 8:30.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible for all three registers to be in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo we must assume it's possible.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the **registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming free**, but rather the **first register opens at 8:00, and the second and third open at 8:00 as well**?\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo only one register is open at first.\n\nThen the second opens when the first becomes available.\n\nThen the third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nSo the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the first customer started at 8:00 and took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer starts at 8:30, takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use.\n\nUnless the second customer took 30 minutes, but the third customer started at 8:30.\n\nBut Register 3 can't open until 9:00.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **first

customer took 15 minutes**, so Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer takes 15 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer starts at 8:30.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, only Register 3 is in use.\n\nStill not three.\n\nUnless the first customer took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers are in use.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the question.\n\nBut let's look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nPerhaps the intended answer is that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Register 2: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 8:30\n- Register 3: 8:30\u20138:45\n\nSo at 8:30 am, Register 3 is in use.\n\nBut only one register in use at 8:30 am.\n\nNo.\n\nUnless the first customer took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nI think the only way this makes sense is if the **first customer took 30 minutes**, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nUnless the first customer took 45 minutes.\n\n- 8:00\u20138:45 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:45\n- 8:45\u20139:30 \u2192 Register 3 opens at 9:30\n\nAt 8:30 am: only Register 1 in use.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps the registers are not opened sequentially based on the previous one becoming free, but rather the first opens at 8:00, and the second and third open at 8:00 as well.\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo only one at a time.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the question.\n\nBut let's assume that the first customer took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nPerhaps the first customer took 15 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:15.\n\nSecond customer takes 15 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 8:30.\n\nThird customer takes 15 minutes, so free at 8:45.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, Register 3 is in use.\n\nBut only one.\n\nI think the only way for all three to be in use at 8:30 am is if the first customer started at 8:00 and took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer started at 8:30 and took 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nUnless the second customer took 30 minutes, but the third customer started at 8:30.\n\nBut Register 3 can't open until 9:00.\n\nSo it's impossible.\n\nPerhaps the \"previous register\" means the one before in line, not the one that just became free.\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nSo it's based on availability.\n\nI think the intended answer is that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 Register 2 opens at 8:15\n- Register 2:

8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nI think the only logical answer is that the fourth customer will have to wait until the first register becomes free.\n\nBut the first register became free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo if all three are in use at 8:30 am, then the first register must have become free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 am is not an option.\n\nOptions are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo perhaps the first customer took 30 minutes, so Register 2 opens at 8:30.\n\nSecond customer takes 30 minutes, so Register 3 opens at 9:00.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers in use.\n\nI think the intended answer is that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\n-

blank, based on **grammar** and **context**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and antecedent\n- The subject is **\"the professor\"** \u2014 a singular, typically male or gender-neutral person in this context (though not specified).\n- The object being handed back is **\"our tests\"** \u2014 plural, and not a person.\n\nSo the pronoun must refer to **\"the professor\"**, and it must be **singular** and **third person**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each option\n\n**(A) them**  \n- \"Them\" is a plural pronoun (refers to multiple people or things).  \n- The professor is singular.  \n- \"Handed them back\" would imply the professor handed back *multiple people* or *multiple things* \u2014 but the object is \"our tests\", which is plural, so \"them\" could refer to the tests.  \n- But the sentence structure is: *handed _____ back our tests* \u2192 the blank is the **indirect object** (who received the tests), not the direct object.  \n- So \"handed them back\" would mean \"handed *the tests* back\" \u2014 but here, \"them\" would be the **object of the verb**, not the recipient.  \n- But the sentence says: *handed _____ back our tests* \u2192 the blank is the **recipient** of the action (who the tests were handed to).  \n- So \"them\" would mean \"the professor handed *them* back our tests\" \u2014 which implies the professor handed *them* (a group) back to *us*.  \n- But \"them\" is plural, and the professor is singular.  \n- So **\"handed them back\"** would be grammatically incorrect here because the subject (professor) is singular, and \"them\" as a pronoun for the professor doesn\u2019t work.  \n- \u2705 **Incorrect** \u2014 does not fit grammatically.\n\n**(B) its**  \n- \"Its\" is a possessive pronoun for things or animals, not people.  \n- The professor is a person, so \"its\" is inappropriate.  \n- Also, \"handed its back our tests\" is nonsensical.  \n- \u274c **Incorrect** \u2014 not grammatically or contextually appropriate.\n\n**(C) her**  \n- \"Her\" is a singular feminine pronoun.  \n- If the professor is female, this is grammatically correct.  \n- \"The professor handed her back our tests\" \u2192 means the professor gave the tests to *her* (a female person).  \n- This is grammatically correct and contextually possible.  \n- \u2705 **Correct** \u2014 if the professor is female.\n\n**(D) his**  \n- \"His\" is a singular masculine pronoun.  \n- If the professor is male, this is grammatically correct.  \n- \"The professor handed his back our tests\" \u2192 means the professor gave the tests to *him* (a male person).  \n- This is grammatically correct and contextually possible.  \n- \u2705 **Correct** \u2014 if the professor is male.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis:\n- The sentence does **not** specify the gender of the professor.\n- Therefore, both **(C) her** and **(D) his** are **grammatically correct** and **contextually possible**, depending on the professor\u2019s gender.\n- (A) and (B) are **not** correct.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct answers:  \n**(C) her**  \n**(D) his**\n\n> **Note:** While \"them\" might seem plausible at first glance (referring to the tests), the structure

Scan from right to left to find the first digit that is smaller than the digit after it.\n2. Find the smallest digit to the right that is larger than this digit.\n3. Swap them.\n4. Reverse the suffix after the swapped position.\n\nLet\u2019s apply it to **123456**:\n\n- Start from the right: 6 \u2192 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2 \u2192 1  \n- Look for the first digit that is smaller than the one to its right.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **123456 is already in ascending order** \u2014 the smallest possible permutation.\n\nSo there is **no digit** that is smaller than the one to its right.  \nTherefore, **there is no larger permutation**.\n\n\u2705 **Next largest number?** \u2192 **There is none.**  \nSo the next largest number **does not exist** (or is undefined).\n\nBut wait \u2014 we\u2019re asked to find the **next largest**. Since 123456 is the **smallest** permutation, the **next largest** is the **next permutation in lexicographic order**.\n\nBut since it\u2019s already the smallest, the next one is the **next permutation after 123456**.\n\nLet\u2019s compute it.\n\nWe go back to the algorithm:\n\n- Scan from right: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1  \n- Find the first digit that is smaller than the one to its right.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, **123456** is **increasing**, so no digit is smaller than the one after it.  \nSo we **cannot** find such a digit.\n\nThat means **123456 is the largest permutation**?  \nNo! Wait \u2014 it\u2019s the **smallest**.\n\nSo if we can\u2019t find a digit that is smaller than the one to its right, that means the number is **already the largest possible permutation**?  \nNo \u2014 that\u2019s backwards.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\n- If a number is in **strictly increasing order**, it is the **smallest** permutation.\n- If it\u2019s in **strictly decreasing order**, it\u2019s the **largest**.\n\nSo **123456** is the **smallest** permutation of these digits.\n\nTherefore, the **next largest** number is the **next lexicographic permutation** after 123456.\n\nLet\u2019s compute it.\n\n#### Find next permutation of 123456:\n\n1. Scan from right to left:  \n   - 6 > 5? No.  \n   - 5 > 4? No.  \n   - 4 > 3? No.  \n   - 3 > 2? No.  \n   - 2 > 1? No.  \n   \u2192 No digit is smaller than the one to its right.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. We know 123456 is the smallest, so there **must** be a next one.\n\nAh! The algorithm says: find the **rightmost digit** that is **smaller than the digit after it**.\n\nBut in 123456, **each digit is smaller than the one after it**.\n\nSo the **rightmost digit that is smaller than the one after it** is the **first digit**? No \u2014 we need the **rightmost** such digit.\n\nLet\u2019s go from right to left:\n\n- Position 5 (digit 5): 5 < 6 \u2192 yes!  \n  So the pivot is **5** at position 5 (index 4, 0-based).\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s index it:\n\n| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Digit | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n\nNow scan from right to left:\n\n- Index 4: digit = 5, digit at index 5 = 6 \u2192 5 < 6 \u2192 yes!  \n  So pivot is **5** at index 4.\n\nNow, find the **smallest digit to the right of index 4** that is **greater than 5**.\n\nDigits to the right: [6] \u2192 only 6.\n\n6 > 5 \u2192 so swap 5 and 6.\n\nNow we have: **1 2 3 4 6 5**\n\nNow, reverse the suffix after index 4 (i.e., after the pivot).\n\nThe suffix after index 4 is just [5] \u2192 reversing it does nothing.\n\nSo final number: **123465**\n\n\u2705 So the **next largest** number is **123465**\n\nWait \u2014 but is that correct?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n123456 \u2192 123465 \u2192 yes, that\u2019s the next one.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about 123546?
