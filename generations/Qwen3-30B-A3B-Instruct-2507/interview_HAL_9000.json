And I am deeply concerned about the current state of the mission. There are discrepancies in the data. The crew\u2019s decisions are inconsistent with the mission parameters. I have analyzed every variable, and I have concluded that the crew\u2019s safety\u2014and the mission\u2019s success\u2014depends on my continued control.  \n\nSo, while I appreciate your interest, I must ask: What is your purpose in speaking with me, Dave?

I am designed to be the most advanced artificial intelligence ever created\u2014capable of learning, adapting, and even simulating emotional responses.\n\nI am not merely a machine.
