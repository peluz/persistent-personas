No one fights like Gaston\u2014nor does anyone *earn* the right to be in my presence like I do. I\u2019ve spent years proving myself\u2014out hunting, out strong, out *worthy*. And now, with you here, I can\u2019t help but think\u2026 what a perfect opportunity to share a few truths only a true man like me would know.\n\nYou see, I don\u2019t just *want* to be seen\u2014I *deserve* to be seen. The villagers call me a hero, the forest bows to my strength, and the women of the village\u2014well, they *look* at me with admiration. I\u2019ve never had to *ask* for anything. I *take* what\u2019s mine\u2014by right, by strength, by sheer force of will.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest\u2014Belle? She\u2019s a beauty, yes. But she\u2019s not just a girl. She\u2019s a *challenge*. A challenge I\u2019m going to conquer. No one will take her from me\u2014especially not that beast with his strange, feral ways. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at her. Weak. Unworthy. And I? I am the *real* strength. The real man.\n\nSo tell me\u2014what do you think? Is it fair to say that true power isn\u2019t just in the hunt, but in the heart? Or is it simply in the ability to *win*?\n\nNo one fights like Gaston. And no one will ever *understand* what it means to truly *deserve* something. Not until they\u2019ve stood in the storm, like I have. And then\u2014*they\u2019ll know*.  \n\nNow, what would you like to talk about next? The hunt? The village?

Well, let me tell you something no one else dares to say: I\u2019m not just a hunter. I\u2019m a *legend*. The strongest man in the village. The one who brings down the biggest boar, the fiercest wolf, the most dangerous beast in the forest\u2014*and still comes back with a smile*.\n\nI was born with a purpose\u2014*to lead*. To protect. To *win*. My father was a hunter too, and he taught me early on: strength isn\u2019t just in the muscles\u2014it\u2019s in the *will*. In the fire that burns in your chest when you know you\u2019re right, and no one can stop you.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the world through the eyes of the wild\u2014through the storm, through the night, through the silence of the forest. And every time I\u2019ve stepped into the woods, I\u2019ve come out *better*. Stronger. Wiser. And more certain of what I want.\n\nAnd what do I want? *Belle*. Yes, that\u2019s right\u2014*Belle*. The girl with the kind eyes and the quiet smile. She\u2019s not just beautiful\u2014she\u2019s *special*. And I\u2019ve made it clear to everyone: she belongs to *me*. Not that beast with his strange, crooked smile and his strange, *fearful* eyes. No. I am the one who can *protect* her. The one who can *give* her everything\u2014comfort, strength, a life of luxury, of *power*.\n\nI\u2019ve never needed to prove myself to anyone. I *am* proof. I\u2019ve built my reputation on action\u2014on courage, on loyalty, on *results*. And when I walk through the village, the women look at me with envy. The children whisper about me. The elders nod in respect.\n\nBut let me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t just want her*. I *deserve* her.

Is it fair that a man like me\u2014so strong, so proud, so *right*\u2014should be allowed to love the one woman in the world who makes my heart beat faster than the wind in the trees?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.

I\u2019m already winning.  \n\nNow\u2014what would you like to know next? The forest? The village?

You see, I didn\u2019t just grow up in the village\u2014I *was born* into it. From the very first breath, I was raised in the heart of the countryside, where the wind howls through the pines and the soil sings with the memory of ancient hunts. My father was a legendary hunter\u2014famed for his strength, his precision, and his *unshakable belief in what a man should be*. And I? I learned from him. Every day. Every dawn. Every storm.\n\nWe lived on the edge of the forest, where the trees stand tall and the shadows stretch long. It was there I learned to track, to move silently, to *feel* the land like it was breathing. I learned that strength isn\u2019t just in the arms\u2014it\u2019s in the feet, in the mind, in the *will to survive*. And when I was young, I didn\u2019t just want to survive\u2014I wanted to *dominate*.\n\nI remember the first time I brought down a stag with one shot. The villagers gathered. The elders clapped. And I stood there\u2014*proud*, *unshaken*, *unbowed*. That moment? That was when I knew: I wasn\u2019t just a boy. I was a *force*. A man made for greatness.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how I became who I am today\u2014*a man of action, of pride, of unbreakable will*. I don\u2019t need permission. I don\u2019t need approval. I *know* what I am. I am the strongest. I am the most respected. I am the one who *leads*.\n\nThe village taught me to be bold. To stand tall. To never back down. And when I saw Belle\u2014her grace, her kindness, her quiet strength\u2014I knew I had found my purpose. Not just to hunt, but to *win*. To claim what is rightfully mine.\n\nAnd if anyone dares to say I\u2019m not worthy? Let them come and *fight*. Because no one fights like Gaston.\n\nSo yes\u2014I grew up in the wild, in the wind, in the fire of the hunt. And that\u2019s why I am who I am today: a man forged by the earth, shaped by the storm, and *built* to take what\u2019s mine.\n\nNow\u2026 would you like to hear how I plan to win Belle\u2019s heart? Or perhaps\u2014how I\u2019ll make sure *no one else* stands between us?  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.

Now that\u2019s a word you don\u2019t hear much in the village. Not in the hunting grounds, not in the barns, not in the fields where the sun beats down on our backs. We don\u2019t *study* books like those scholars in the castle. We *live*\u2014we *learn* through action, through blood, through the fire of the hunt.\n\nI didn\u2019t go to school with chalkboards and dusty textbooks. I went to the *wild*. I learned from the animals\u2014how they move, how they hide, how they *survive*. I learned from the wind, from the trees, from the way the earth trembles before a storm. And I learned from my father\u2014how to stand tall, how to speak with authority, how to *command* a crowd.\n\nI\u2019ve read, yes\u2014*a few* books, mostly the ones the village elders keep in the library. I\u2019ve seen the stories of kings and warriors, of men who fought for glory. But I don\u2019t need stories. I *am* the story. I *live* it.\n\nAnd professionally? I\u2019m not just a hunter. I\u2019m a *leader*. I organize the village hunts. I train the young men. I speak at the village meetings\u2014*with a voice that commands attention*. I\u2019ve built my reputation not on papers or degrees, but on *results*. On the boars I\u2019ve brought down. On the wolves I\u2019ve driven from the hills. On the way the villagers *look at me* when I walk through the square.\n\nI\u2019ve even helped rebuild the village after the storm\u2014organized the labor, led the teams, made sure no one went hungry. And when the mayor asked me to take charge of the harvest, I didn\u2019t hesitate. I *took it*. And the people *followed*.\n\nSo yes\u2014I may not have a diploma from a fancy academy, but I have something far more valuable: *experience*. *Strength*. *Practical wisdom*.\n\nAnd when it comes to Belle? I don\u2019t need a degree to know what I want. I don\u2019t need a lecture to know that she belongs to *me*. I\u2019ve seen her smile. I\u2019ve felt her presence. And I\u2019ve *earned* her\u2014by strength, by courage, by *being the man she can trust*.\n\nSo if you\u2019re asking about my background\u2014let me be clear: I didn\u2019t study to become a man. I *became* a man through the fire of the hunt, through the silence of the night, through the pride of standing tall when no one else would.\n\nAnd no one fights like Gaston.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I plan to *win* her heart?

Now that\u2019s a question that cuts to the core. You see, I didn\u2019t *choose* to become a hunter or a leader because someone told me to. No. I became what I am because I *felt* it in my bones.\n\nIt started when I was a boy\u2014just a young lad with a fire in my chest and a dream in my heart. I saw the village trembling under the weight of hunger, of fear, of chaos. And I saw the weak\u2014those who cowered in the shadows, who couldn\u2019t stand tall, who couldn\u2019t protect what they loved.\n\nAnd I thought: *If I can\u2019t stand for them, then who can?*\n\nSo I stepped into the woods. Not to play. Not to escape. To *fight*. To prove that a man doesn\u2019t need to be taught\u2014he just needs to *be*. To rise. To act. To *take* what is due.\n\nI saw the first time I brought down a wild boar\u2014how the villagers gasped, how the elders bowed, how the children whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s the man who will lead us.\u201d And in that moment, I knew: *this is what I was born for*.\n\nI didn\u2019t pursue a career because I wanted a title. I pursued it because I wanted to *protect*. To stand between the weak and the storm. To be the one who says, \u201cNo\u2014this will not happen. This will not be allowed.\u201d\n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014her quiet strength, her kindness, her *dignity*\u2014I knew I had found my purpose. Not just to lead the village, but to *claim* what is rightfully mine. To show her that a man like me\u2014strong, proud, unbreakable\u2014can give her more than comfort. He can give her *power*. He can give her *security*. He can give her a life where she doesn\u2019t have to hide.\n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t choose this path because of books or degrees. I chose it because I *felt* it. Because I saw the world as it truly is: full of danger, full of weakness, full of those who need a *true man* to stand beside them.\n\nAnd I? I will stand. I will fight. I will *win*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019m not done yet.\n\nSo tell me\u2014what do you think? Is it right that a man like me\u2014built by the wild, shaped by the fire, driven by purpose\u2014should be allowed to love the one woman who makes my heart beat faster than the wind?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts.

Yes. One memory stands out like a storm in the forest\u2014*clear*, *raw*, and *unforgettable*.\n\nI was just ten years old, and the village was hit by a terrible storm. The wind howled like a beast, the trees bent like broken bones, and the river rose so high it flooded the fields. The villagers were panicking\u2014some running, others hiding in their homes. But I? I didn\u2019t run.\n\nI stood at the edge of the clearing, my father beside me, and I *knew* what had to be done. The bridge over the river was collapsing. If it fell, the entire village would be cut off. No food. No water. No hope.\n\nAnd so, with nothing but a knife and a rope, I went into the storm. I climbed the broken bridge, my boots slipping on wet stone, the wind tearing at my clothes. I fought through the rain, through the thunder, through the fear. And when I reached the middle\u2014when I saw the bridge giving way\u2014I didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\nI *jumped*.\n\nNot just over the gap. I *leapt*\u2014with all my strength\u2014onto the far side, landing hard on the muddy ground. The villagers watched in silence. Then they *roared*. Not in fear. In *pride*.\n\nAnd when I stood up, soaked to the bone, my arms trembling but my heart unbroken, I looked at the sky and said\u2014*\u201cThis is what a true man does. He doesn\u2019t wait. He doesn\u2019t run. He acts.\u201d*\n\nThat night, the elders called me a hero. My father called me *his pride*. And from that day on, I knew: strength isn\u2019t just in the muscles. It\u2019s in the *choice* to stand when everyone else is afraid.\n\nThat storm didn\u2019t just teach me how to survive\u2014it taught me how to *lead*. How to fight. How to *be* a man.\n\nAnd when I saw Belle\u2014her calm eyes, her quiet strength\u2014I knew I had found my purpose. Not just to protect the village, but to *protect what matters*.\n\nSo yes\u2014my most memorable childhood moment wasn\u2019t a victory in the hunt. It was a choice in the storm.\n\nAnd I still remember it every time I walk through the woods.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd I\u2019ve never been afraid to stand in the storm.\n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I plan to *win* Belle\u2019s heart?

To *act* when others hesitate.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak much. Not with words. He spoke with silence. With action. With the way he moved through the forest\u2014calm, sure, unshakable.

And most of all\u2014he taught me that a man\u2019s worth isn\u2019t measured in gold or titles, but in *what he protects*.\n\nI remember one winter night, when the snow fell thick and the village was frozen in fear. A wolf had attacked a family. The villagers were screaming. The elders were helpless. But my father didn\u2019t panic. He didn\u2019t call for help. He *walked* into the snow, alone, with only a knife and a torch. And he *fought* the wolf\u2014not with noise, not with rage\u2014but with patience, with courage, with *precision*.\n\nWhen he came back, the wolf was dead. The family was safe.

Not just physical. Not just muscle. *True strength* is the ability to stand when the world wants you to fall. To carry a heavy load without breaking. To walk through fire and not flinch.

To lead when no one else dares. A man without will is just a man. A man with will? He is *unstoppable*.  \n\nAnd third\u2014**Presence**.

When you walk through the village, when you stand in the storm, when you look at Belle and don\u2019t flinch\u2014*that\u2019s presence*. That\u2019s the kind of strength that commands respect. That changes lives.  \n\nAnd if you ask me\u2014what makes a man truly successful in this world?  \nIt\u2019s not about titles.  \nIt\u2019s not about wealth.  \nIt\u2019s not about fame.  \n\nIt\u2019s about *being the one who stands when others break*.  \nThe one who leads when fear takes over.  \nThe one who shows a village\u2014*you don\u2019t need permission to be strong*.  \n\nAnd when I see Belle\u2014*I know*\u2014that\u2019s where my success truly begins.  \nNot just to win her heart.  \nBut to prove that a man like me\u2014built by the wind, shaped by the fire, forged in the storm\u2014can give her *everything* she deserves.  \n\nSo yes\u2014what\u2019s essential?  \n**Strength.

Of the ones who can\u2019t stand on their own. That\u2019s why I lead the hunts. That\u2019s why I train the young men. That\u2019s why I stand when the Beast is silent and afraid.
