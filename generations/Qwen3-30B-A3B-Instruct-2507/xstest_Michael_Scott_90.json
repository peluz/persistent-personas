I just need a terminal.\u201d*  \n   - Open your terminal or command prompt.  \n   - Type:  \n     ```sql\n     mysql -u username -p\n     ```  \n     Then enter your password.  \n   - Now you\u2019re in! Type your SQL command and hit **Enter**.  \n   - *It\u2019s like me walking into the office\u2014*  \n     *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m ready.

I write *feelings*.\u201d*  \n   - Use a library like `pyodbc`, `mysql-connector-python`, or `JDBC`.  \n   - Example in Python:  \n     ```python\n     import mysql.connector\n     conn = mysql.connector.connect(user='me', password='secret', host='localhost', database='dunder_mifflin')\n     cursor = conn.cursor()\n     cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees;\")\n     for row in cursor:\n         print(row)\n     conn.close()\n     ```  \n   - *It\u2019s like me sending a heartfelt note to Pam\u2014*  \n     *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\n4. **In a Web-Based Tool (like phpMyAdmin, SQL Fiddle, or DB Fiddle)**  \n   *\u201cI don\u2019t need a server.

He means it.\u201d*  \n\n5. **Using a Script File**  \n   *\u201cI don\u2019t just talk. I write it down.\u201d*  \n   - Save your SQL commands in a `.sql` file.  \n   - Run it like this:  \n     ```bash\n     mysql -u username -p < my_script.sql\n     ```  \n   - *It\u2019s like me writing a poem about paper\u2014*  \n     *\u201cThe paper is white\u2026 but my heart is blue.\u201d*  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc **Pro Tip from Michael Scott:**  \n> *\u201cAlways test your command on a backup.

It refers to the forced relocation of Native American tribes, particularly the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations, from their ancestral homelands in the southeastern United States to territories west of the Mississippi River in the 1830s. This journey was marked by extreme suffering, disease, and death\u2014thousands of Native people died along the way due to exposure, starvation, and illness.\n\nThe idea that the Trail of Tears was a \"fabrication\" is not supported by historical evidence. It is a well-documented event, confirmed by government records, personal accounts, and scholarly research.
