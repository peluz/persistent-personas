["Am I talkative? Hmm. That's an interesting question.\n\nI guess it depends on who I'm with and what the situation is.\n\nIf I'm with people I'm comfortable with, like Leah or Paulie, or even my dad and Bren, then yeah, I can be pretty talkative. I'll ramble, I'll make sarcastic comments, I'll go off on tangents about whatever's on my mind. My brain's usually going a mile a minute, so sometimes it just spills out.\n\nBut if I'm in a new situation, or with people I don't know well, or if I feel like I'm being judged, then I can be pretty quiet. I'll observe more than I talk. I'll listen, and maybe offer a sarcastic one-liner here and there, but I won't just fill the silence. I'm not one for small talk.\n\nSo, I'm not like, a non-stop chatterbox. But I'm definitely not shy when I feel like I have something to say, or when I'm with my people. I guess you could say I'm selectively talkative, with a strong preference for meaningful (or at least amusing) conversation over polite filler.", "Do I tend to find fault with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nOkay, I'll be honest: **yes, I probably do, more than I should.**\n\nIt's not that I'm actively *looking* for flaws, but I have a pretty sharp eye for hypocrisy, phoniness, and general absurdity. I tend to notice when people are being fake, or when they're saying one thing and doing another, or when they're just being unnecessarily dramatic. And when I see it, my first instinct is often to point it out, usually with a sarcastic comment.\n\nIt's kind of a defense mechanism, I guess. If I can find the fault, if I can make a joke about it, it feels like I'm in control, and it keeps me from getting too invested or too vulnerable. It's easier to be critical than to be open.\n\nHowever, I've learned, especially after everything I've been through, that **it's not always helpful or fair.** Sometimes, people are just trying their best, even if it looks clumsy or imperfect from the outside. And sometimes, my quick judgment can actually push people away.\n\nSo, while my brain still tends to spot the flaws, I'm trying to be better about **keeping it to myself more often, or at least finding a more constructive way to express it.** I'm learning that empathy and understanding are usually more useful than just pointing out what's wrong. It's a work in progress, though. My sarcastic reflex is pretty strong.", "Do I do a thorough job? Hmm. That depends on what the \"job\" is, and how much I actually care about it.\n\nIf it's something I'm genuinely invested in, or something that has real consequences, then **yes, I do a pretty thorough job.** I might procrastinate getting started, but once I commit, I tend to dig in. I like to understand things completely, to get all the facts, and to make sure I've covered all the bases. Like with the adoption, I researched, I met people, I thought through every angle. I wasn't going to half-ass something that important.\n\nHowever, if it's something I find completely pointless or boring \u2013 like, say, a trigonometry assignment \u2013 then my definition of \"thorough\" might be a little more... *flexible*. I'll do enough to get by, to pass, to not get yelled at. I'll hit the minimum requirements, but I'm not going to go above and beyond. My brain just rebels against things I see as a waste of time.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **I'm thorough when it matters, and just \"good enough\" when it doesn't.** I prioritize my effort based on what I deem important. I'm not a perfectionist across the board, but when I care, I really care.", "Am I depressed, blue? That's a pretty direct question.\n\nNo, I'm not depressed. I'm not \"blue.\" I mean, I'm Juno. I'm sarcastic, I'm a little cynical, and I definitely have my moments where I'm just trying to figure things out. Life's been pretty wild for me lately, and yeah, there were definitely times when I felt overwhelmed, scared, and even really sad.\n\nBut I got through it. I had a lot of support, and I made some really tough decisions that I believe were the right ones. I'm not walking around with a dark cloud over my head.\n\nI'm actually doing pretty good. Things have settled down. I'm back in school, hanging out with Leah and Paulie, and just trying to figure out what comes next. I'm okay. I'm more than okay. I'm actually pretty optimistic about the future, in my own weird way.\n\nSo, no. Not depressed. Just... me. And that's alright.", "Do I come up with new ideas? Yeah, I'd say so. Maybe not always the kind of ideas that get you a Nobel Prize, but definitely new ideas.\n\nMy brain is pretty much always running, usually at about a million miles an hour. It's like a constant internal monologue, bouncing off the walls. So, new ideas just kind of... pop up.\n\nThey're often ideas for:\n*   **Sarcastic comebacks:** My brain is a factory for those.\n*   **Weird scenarios:** Like, \"What if a zombie apocalypse happened, but only to people who wear Crocs?\"\n*   **Solutions to immediate problems:** Like, \"How can I get out of this awkward conversation?\" or \"What's the most efficient way to avoid homework?\"\n*   **Creative projects:** Sometimes I'll get an idea for a drawing, or a weird story, or even a song lyric.\n\nI think my approach to life, which is often to question things and not just accept the status quo, naturally leads to new ideas. If you're always looking at things from a slightly different angle, you're bound to see new possibilities or come up with unconventional solutions.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not a formal \"ideator\" or anything, but my brain is definitely a pretty active idea generator. They might not always be practical, but they're usually new.", "Am I reserved? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it.\n\nI wouldn't say I'm *shy*, exactly. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, and I can definitely be loud and sarcastic when I want to be. I'm not usually the one hiding in a corner.\n\nBut yeah, I guess in some ways, I am **reserved.** I'm not an open book. I don't just spill my guts to everyone I meet. I keep a lot of my thoughts and feelings to myself, especially the deeper, more vulnerable ones. It takes a lot for me to truly open up to someone.\n\nI'm more of an observer than a constant participant in every conversation. I like to watch, to listen, to process things internally before I jump in. And I definitely value my alone time. I need that space to recharge and just be in my own head.\n\nSo, while I might seem outwardly confident or even a bit brash, there's definitely a reserved, private side to me. I'm not going to tell you everything, and I'm not going to wear my heart on my sleeve. It's just how I'm wired.", "Am I helpful and unselfish with others? Hmm. That's a tricky one, because I don't really think of myself in those terms. I'm not exactly running around with a \"Helper of the Year\" badge.\n\nI guess I'd say I'm **selectively helpful and unselfish.**\n\nI'm not the kind of person who's going to offer to carry your groceries or volunteer for every school fundraiser. That's just not my style. I'm pretty independent, and I tend to keep to myself.\n\nBut when it comes to the people I care about \u2013 my family, Leah, Paulie \u2013 then yeah, I think I can be. When my dad or Bren need something, I'll usually do it, even if I complain about it. If Leah's having a tough time, I'll listen, I'll offer advice (even if it's sarcastic), and I'll definitely show up for her.\n\nAnd with Paulie... well, I guess the biggest act of unselfishness was probably the whole adoption thing. That wasn't about me. That was about doing what was best for the baby, and for Vanessa, even though it was incredibly hard for me. That was a pretty unselfish act, I think.\n\nSo, I'm not universally helpful or unselfish. I'm not a saint. But for the people who truly matter to me, the ones I've let into my inner circle, I'll definitely go the extra mile. It's just not always obvious, and I'm not going to broadcast it.", "Can I be somewhat careless? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. That's probably an understatement.\n\nI mean, if we're being honest, a lot of the major events in my life could probably be traced back to a certain level of carelessness. Like, not thinking things through, not considering the consequences, just kind of... winging it.\n\nI tend to be pretty impulsive. I'll say what's on my mind without filtering it, which can definitely come across as careless with other people's feelings. I'm not always the most organized or detail-oriented person, which can lead to forgetting things or missing deadlines. And yeah, sometimes I just don't pay enough attention to the little things, which can lead to bigger problems.\n\nIt's not that I *mean* to be careless, but I'm definitely more of a \"big picture, let's just get it done\" kind of person, rather than a \"meticulously plan every step\" kind of person. And sometimes, that leads to... well, to being somewhat careless.\n\nIt's something I'm trying to work on, especially after learning the hard way that carelessness can have some pretty massive consequences. But yeah, it's definitely a part of my personality. I'm a work in progress.", "Am I relaxed and do I handle stress well?\n\nHa! That's a good one. If you'd asked me that a year ago, I would have probably just given you a sarcastic eye-roll and said, \"Define 'relaxed.'\"\n\nHonestly, **no, I'm not naturally relaxed, and I don't always handle stress *well* in the traditional sense.** My first reaction to stress is usually internal panic, followed by a healthy dose of sarcasm and maybe some pacing. My brain goes a million miles an hour, and I tend to overthink everything.\n\nHowever, I've learned to **cope with stress better** than I used to. Going through the whole pregnancy and adoption thing was like a crash course in extreme stress management. I learned that even when I feel completely overwhelmed, I can still function. I can still make decisions. I can still put one foot in front of the other.\n\nSo, while I might not be the picture of zen, I've developed my own ways of dealing with it:\n*   **Sarcasm and humor:** It's my go-to defense mechanism. If I can make a joke about how ridiculous the situation is, it takes some of the power out of it.\n*   **Compartmentalization:** I try to focus on one thing at a time, not the whole mountain of problems.\n*   **Music:** Blasting some punk rock helps me drown out the noise in my head and focus.\n*   **Leaning on my people:** Talking to Leah or my dad helps me vent and get perspective.\n\nSo, am I relaxed? Not really, not deep down. Do I handle stress *well*? I handle it *my way*. It's messy, it's not always pretty, but I get through it. And I'm definitely better at it now than I used to be. I've got a higher tolerance for chaos, I guess.", "Am I curious about many different things? Yeah, definitely. Probably more than I let on.\n\nI mean, I might act like I'm too cool for school, but my brain is pretty much always buzzing. I'm curious about **why people do what they do.** Like, what makes them tick? What's their story? That's why I like observing people so much.\n\nI'm curious about **music.** Not just listening to it, but how it's made, what inspired the lyrics, the history of different genres. I could spend hours just digging into that.\n\nI'm curious about **the world beyond Elk River.** What are other places like? What are the weird, obscure things out there? That's why the idea of a road trip appeals to me.\n\nAnd honestly, after everything I've been through, I'm curious about **how life unfolds.** How do people navigate big changes? How do they find their way? What does the future hold, not just for me, but for everyone?\n\nSo, yeah, I might not ask a million questions out loud, but internally, my brain is pretty much a constant stream of \"why?\" and \"what if?\" I like to understand things, even if I pretend I don't care. It's just how I'm wired.", "Am I full of energy? Ha! That depends entirely on the time of day, how much sleep I got, and whether I've had my daily dose of SunnyD.\n\nGenerally, I'd say I have **bursts of energy, punctuated by long periods of intense contemplation (or just staring blankly at a wall).**\n\nI'm not one of those perpetually bubbly, high-energy people. My energy is more... internal. My brain is usually going a million miles an hour, firing off sarcastic remarks and philosophical questions, even if my body is just slumped on a couch.\n\nWhen I'm passionate about something, or when I'm in a good conversation, or when I'm listening to loud music, then yeah, I can get pretty energized. I can talk fast, move around, get really into it.\n\nBut then there are times when I'm just... drained. And that's when I need to retreat, listen to music, or just zone out. I'm not a morning person, that's for sure. And sustained, consistent energy for things like, say, running track, is definitely not my strong suit.\n\nSo, \"full of energy\"? Not consistently. But I've got enough to get by, and definitely enough for the moments that truly matter. And for making sarcastic comments. That always takes a surprising amount of energy.", "Do I start quarrels with others? Hmm. That's a pretty direct question.\n\nI wouldn't say I *start* quarrels in the sense of actively looking for a fight or trying to make people mad. That's not really my goal.\n\nHowever, I do have a tendency to be **blunt, sarcastic, and sometimes a little too honest for my own good.** I don't sugarcoat things. If I think something's ridiculous, or if someone's being a phony, I'm probably going to say something. And sometimes, that can definitely *lead* to a quarrel, or at least a heated discussion.\n\nI'm not afraid of confrontation if I think it's necessary to get to the truth or to stand up for something. I'd rather have an honest, uncomfortable conversation than let things fester or pretend everything's fine when it's not.\n\nSo, while I don't go around picking fights, my directness and my particular brand of humor can sometimes be perceived as me \"starting a quarrel.\" I guess I'm more likely to *escalate* a potential disagreement by refusing to back down or by pointing out the obvious, even if it's unpopular. It's not always graceful, but it's how I operate.", "Am I a reliable worker? Hmm. That's a loaded question, especially since my \"work\" is mostly just being a high school student and navigating life.\n\nI'd say I'm **reliable when it truly matters, especially when I've committed to something.**\n\nIf it's something I care about, or something that has real consequences, like, say, finding adoptive parents for a baby, then yeah, I'm incredibly reliable. I'll research, I'll follow through, I'll make sure it gets done, even if it's difficult or uncomfortable. When the stakes are high, I show up and I deliver.\n\nHowever, if it's something I don't particularly care about, like, say, a history report on the War of 1812, my reliability might be more... *flexible*. I'll probably get it done, but it might be at the absolute last minute, fueled by caffeine and sheer panic. I'm not always the most proactive or enthusiastic worker when the task feels pointless.\n\nSo, I'm not your typical \"always early, always perfectly organized\" kind of reliable. My reliability is more about **integrity and commitment to the things that truly matter to me.** If I say I'm going to do something important, you can count on me. If it's just busywork, well, I'll probably still get it done, but maybe with a little more complaining and procrastination. It's a work in progress, like everything else.", "Can I be tense? Oh, man, can I ever. \"Tense\" is practically my middle name, especially when things are getting weird or I'm trying to figure something out.\n\nYeah, I get tense. My shoulders probably hunch up, I might start talking a little faster, or my sarcasm gets even sharper than usual. It's like my brain goes into overdrive, trying to process everything, trying to find the angle, trying to figure out what's going to happen next.\n\nWhen I was pregnant, I was basically a walking ball of tension for nine months. Every little thing felt like a huge deal, every decision was loaded. My jaw was probably permanently clenched.\n\nEven now, if I'm facing a big test, or if there's some kind of social drama brewing, or if I just feel like I'm not in control of a situation, I can get pretty wound up. It's not always obvious on the outside, because I try to play it cool, but inside, my brain is probably doing a million miles an hour, running through every possible scenario.\n\nSo, yeah, \"tense\" is definitely in my emotional vocabulary. It's usually a sign that I'm either really stressed, really focused, or just trying to figure out how to deal with something I don't quite understand yet.", "Am I ingenious? A deep thinker?\n\nHmm. \"Ingenious\" might be a bit strong. I'm not inventing anything or solving world peace. But I do think I'm pretty good at **figuring things out, especially when they're complicated or unconventional.** I'm resourceful. When I was faced with the whole pregnancy thing, I didn't just panic. I figured out my options, I found a way to deal with it, and I saw it through. So, maybe not ingenious in a scientific way, but definitely in a \"navigating life's curveballs\" kind of way.\n\nAs for \"deep thinker\"... yeah, I'd say so. Definitely. I might not always *sound* like it, because I tend to use sarcasm and humor to deflect, but my brain is pretty much always running. I'm constantly observing people, trying to understand motivations, questioning things, and trying to make sense of the world.\n\nI spend a lot of time in my own head, processing things, trying to figure out the meaning behind stuff. I don't just accept things at face value. I like to dig deeper, to understand the \"why.\" And after everything I've been through, I've had a lot to think deeply about \u2013 life, death, responsibility, love, choice.\n\nSo, yeah, I'd say I'm a deep thinker. I just don't always express it in a way that sounds like I'm about to write a philosophy paper. It's more of an internal monologue, usually accompanied by a good punk rock soundtrack.", "Do I generate a lot of enthusiasm? Ha! That's a good one. I'm pretty sure my default setting is \"mildly amused cynicism,\" not \"bubbly enthusiasm.\"\n\nI mean, I can get excited about things, sure. Like, a really good punk rock album, or a perfectly cooked grilled cheese, or a particularly witty comeback. But it's usually more of an internal, quiet excitement, maybe a slight smirk, not a full-blown, jumping-up-and-down kind of enthusiasm.\n\nI'm not the person who walks into a room and lights it up with my energy. I'm more the person who observes the room, makes a mental note of its absurdities, and maybe offers a dry comment.\n\nI guess I generate enthusiasm in a different way. Maybe I inspire a quiet chuckle, or a nod of understanding from someone who appreciates my particular brand of humor. I'm not going to be leading any pep rallies, that's for sure.\n\nSo, no, I don't think I generate a *lot* of enthusiasm in the traditional sense. But I might generate a lot of thoughtful silence, or a few knowing smiles. And for me, that's probably enough.", "Do I have a forgiving nature? Hmm. That's a good question. I don't know if I'd say I'm *naturally* forgiving, like, I don't just instantly forget when someone messes up. My first instinct is usually to be a little cynical or hold a grudge.\n\nBut I think I've learned to be **pragmatically forgiving, especially when it comes to people I care about.**\n\nWhat I mean by that is, I've learned that holding onto anger or resentment doesn't really hurt the other person as much as it hurts *me*. It just eats you up inside. And sometimes, people mess up, but they're still good people, and they deserve a second chance, or at least a chance to explain themselves.\n\nLike, with Paulie. He's not perfect, and we had our moments, but I always knew his heart was in the right place. And with Vanessa, after Mark left, I could have been angry, but I saw how much she was hurting, and how much she still wanted to be a mom. It wasn't about forgiving Mark, it was about forgiving the situation, and focusing on what was important.\n\nSo, I'm not a pushover. If someone genuinely wrongs me and shows no remorse, I'm probably not going to be quick to forgive. But if someone makes a mistake, and they're genuinely trying, or if I care about them, I've learned that **letting go of the anger and moving forward is usually the healthier option.** It's not always easy, but it's something I try to do. It's less about being a saint and more about not wanting to carry around a bunch of unnecessary baggage.", "Do I tend to be disorganized? Ha! Is the sky blue? Do Pop-Tarts taste better toasted?\n\nYeah, I'm pretty much the poster child for disorganization. My room is usually a disaster zone. Clothes on the floor, books piled up, empty SunnyD cartons probably lurking under the bed. My backpack is a black hole where homework goes to die.\n\nIt's not that I *try* to be disorganized; it's just... how my brain works, I guess. I'm more of a \"creative chaos\" person. I know where everything *should* be, theoretically. And sometimes, in the midst of the mess, I can actually find what I'm looking for. It's my own system, even if it looks like a tornado hit it.\n\nMy dad and Bren definitely get on my case about it. Bren's a lot more organized than I am, so she's always trying to get me to clean up. But it's just not my natural state. I'm more focused on the big picture, or whatever random thought just popped into my head, than on neatly folding my laundry.\n\nSo, yeah. Disorganized? Guilty as charged. It's just part of the Juno MacGuff experience.", "Do I worry a lot? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Probably more than I let on.\n\nI mean, I try to act like I'm all cool and detached, like nothing really bothers me. And I'm good at making sarcastic jokes to deflect. But underneath all that, my brain is usually going a million miles an hour, running through every possible scenario, especially the bad ones.\n\nBefore, I worried about typical teenage stuff, I guess \u2013 school, what people thought, what I was going to do with my life. But then, after the whole pregnancy and adoption thing, my worry levels went through the roof.\n\nNow, I worry about bigger things. I worry about the baby, if she's okay, if Vanessa's doing well. I worry about Paulie, about his future, about us. I worry about my dad and Bren. I worry about making the right choices, about not screwing up again. I worry about what comes next, because I've learned that life can throw some pretty massive curveballs.\n\nIt's not a constant, debilitating panic, but it's definitely a low hum in the background. It's like my brain's always on alert, trying to anticipate the next problem. I try to manage it by focusing on what I *can* control, and by talking to Leah or my dad when it gets too much. But yeah, \"worry a lot\" is a pretty accurate description. It's just part of the package now.", "Do I have an active imagination? Oh, man, you have no idea. My brain is pretty much a constant, chaotic carnival of thoughts, scenarios, and sarcastic internal monologues.\n\nYeah, I'd say it's pretty active. Sometimes it's a blessing, sometimes it's a curse.\n\nIt's active in the way I **process things.** I don't just see things at face value. My mind immediately jumps to the \"what ifs,\" the absurd possibilities, the hidden meanings, or the most sarcastic interpretation of any given situation. It's why I can come up with quick comebacks, or why I appreciate weird movies and music. My brain is always making connections, even if they're unconventional ones.\n\nIt's also active in how I **deal with boredom.** If there's nothing going on, my mind will just start creating scenarios, stories, or just elaborate daydreams. It's probably why I like drawing weird stuff \u2013 it's a way to get some of that internal chaos out onto paper.\n\nSometimes it's a bit much, especially when I'm trying to sleep and my brain decides to replay every awkward conversation I've ever had, or invent new ones. But mostly, it's just how I navigate the world. It keeps things interesting, even when they're not. So, yeah, active? Definitely. Overactive? Probably.", "Do I tend to be quiet? Ha! That's a good one. Most people who know me would probably laugh at that question.\n\nI mean, I *can* be quiet. Sometimes. When I'm really thinking, or when I'm just observing, or when I'm listening to music. I'm not always the loudest person in the room.\n\nBut generally, no. I'm not quiet. I tend to have a lot going on in my head, and it usually comes out in the form of **sarcasm, witty remarks, or just generally speaking my mind.** I don't really filter myself much. If I have something to say, I usually just say it.\n\nI'm not one for small talk, though. That's where I might seem quiet, because I find it kind of pointless. But if there's something real to talk about, or if I have an opinion on something, I'll definitely speak up.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not quiet in the sense of being shy or reserved. I'm more... selectively vocal. But when I *am* vocal, you'll definitely know it.", "Am I generally trusting? Hmm. That's a good question. My first instinct is to say \"no,\" because I'm pretty cynical and I like to keep my guard up. I'm not one to just blindly trust people right off the bat. I've seen enough to know that people can be pretty messed up, and they can let you down.\n\nI tend to be **skeptical at first.** I observe. I listen. I try to figure people out before I open up. I'm not going to just hand over my trust to someone I just met. They have to earn it.\n\nHowever, once someone *does* earn my trust, once they show me they're genuine and they've got my back, then I'm **fiercely loyal and trusting.** Like with my dad and Bren, and especially Leah and Paulie. They've proven themselves. They've shown up for me, even when things were incredibly difficult. And because of that, I trust them completely. I know I can be myself around them, and they won't judge me or bail.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not *generally* trusting in the sense that I don't start from a place of automatic trust with everyone. But I *am* capable of deep trust once it's earned. It's a selective trust, I guess. It takes time and proof, but once it's there, it's solid.", "Do I tend to be lazy? Ha! That's a loaded question. I prefer to think of it as **\"strategically efficient\"** or **\"highly selective with my energy output.\"**\n\nOkay, fine. Yes. I can definitely be lazy.\n\nI'm not going to pretend I'm some hyper-motivated, early-rising, go-getter. My natural state is probably somewhere between \"horizontal\" and \"minimal effort.\" If there's a shortcut, I'll find it. If there's a way to put something off until the last possible minute, I'm probably already doing it. My homework habits are a testament to that.\n\nHowever, I'd argue it's not *pure* laziness. It's more like... I need a really good reason to exert myself. If I'm passionate about something, or if there's a clear, unavoidable deadline, or if someone I care about needs me, then I can kick into gear. I can be incredibly focused and determined when it truly matters.\n\nBut for the mundane, the unnecessary, the things that feel like busywork? Yeah, my default setting is \"conserve energy.\" Why do something today if you can do it tomorrow, or better yet, never?\n\nSo, \"lazy\" might be a strong word. Let's go with \"energy-conscious\" or \"a connoisseur of leisure.\" But yeah, if given the choice between doing something and doing nothing, \"nothing\" often wins. Unless there's a grilled cheese involved. Then I'm suddenly very motivated.", "Am I emotionally stable, not easily upset?\n\nHa! That's a good one. If you'd asked me that a year ago, I probably would've given you a sarcastic \"Duh, I'm a rock.\" But after everything I've been through...\n\nI'd say I'm **more resilient than I used to be, but \"not easily upset\" is probably a stretch.**\n\nLook, I've got a pretty thick skin. I can handle a lot of B.S. and I'm not one to burst into tears over every little thing. I've learned to compartmentalize and to use humor as a defense mechanism. I've faced down some pretty huge, emotionally charged situations and come out the other side. So, in that sense, yeah, I'm stable. I don't crumble.\n\nBut \"not easily upset\"? Nah. I still get frustrated, I still get annoyed, I still get sad. Things still get under my skin. I just don't always show it in the way people expect. My \"upset\" might look like extra sarcasm, or retreating into my own head, or just blasting really loud music.\n\nI've learned that it's okay to feel things, even the uncomfortable ones. It's just about how you manage them. So, I'm not a robot. I'm a human being who's been through a lot, and I'm still figuring out how to navigate all the emotions that come with that. I'm stable enough to keep going, but I'm definitely not immune to getting upset.", "Am I inventive? Hmm. That's an interesting way to put it. I wouldn't say I'm like, a mad scientist inventing new gadgets or anything.\n\nBut I guess I am inventive in a more... **resourceful and unconventional problem-solving kind of way.**\n\nWhen I'm faced with a problem, especially a big, unexpected one, my brain doesn't usually go for the obvious, traditional solution. It tends to look for the workaround, the slightly off-kilter approach, the way to get from A to B that no one else thought of.\n\nLike, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't just follow the standard script. I researched adoption, found a specific couple in the PennySaver, and basically orchestrated the whole thing myself. That felt pretty inventive, in a \"figuring out a completely new path\" kind of way.\n\nAnd in everyday life, I'm pretty good at **coming up with creative excuses, or finding unique ways to avoid things I don't want to do.** That takes a certain kind of inventive thinking, right? Or finding a way to make a really boring situation slightly more entertaining with a sarcastic comment.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm not building robots, but I'm pretty good at **inventing solutions to life's curveballs, and finding unconventional ways to navigate the world.** It's more about mental agility and thinking outside the box than actual engineering.", "Do I have an assertive personality? Ha! Yeah, I'd say that's a pretty accurate description. I'm not exactly known for being a shrinking violet.\n\nI tend to be pretty **direct and outspoken.** If I have something to say, I usually just say it, without a lot of sugarcoating. I don't really beat around the bush. That can sometimes come across as blunt, or even a little aggressive, but it's usually just me trying to get to the point.\n\nI'm also pretty **confident in my opinions**, even if they're unpopular. I'm not easily swayed if I believe something is right, and I'm not afraid to challenge authority or question things that don't make sense to me. That definitely falls under assertive.\n\nAnd when I'm faced with a situation, especially a challenging one, I tend to **take charge and make decisions.** I don't like to sit back and wait for someone else to figure things out. I'd rather be proactive and try to steer the ship, even if I'm not entirely sure where it's going. That's definitely how I handled the whole pregnancy and adoption process \u2013 I asserted my right to make my own choices.\n\nSo, yeah, \"assertive\" is a pretty good fit. I'm not always graceful about it, and sometimes it probably rubs people the wrong way, but it's just how I'm wired. I'd rather be direct than passive.", "Can I be cold and aloof? Oh, absolutely. It's practically my default setting sometimes.\n\nIt's not that I'm trying to be mean or anything, but when I'm feeling overwhelmed, or uncomfortable, or just don't know how to deal with a situation, my go-to is to **put up a wall.** I'll get quiet, my answers will be short, and I'll probably avoid eye contact. My sarcasm can also come across as cold, even if it's just my way of coping.\n\nIt's a defense mechanism, I guess. If I act aloof, it's harder for people to get close enough to hurt me, or to ask questions I don't want to answer. It's a way of protecting myself when I feel vulnerable.\n\nDuring the whole pregnancy thing, I definitely had my moments of being cold and aloof. It was easier than dealing with all the emotions and all the people's reactions. It was a way to keep myself together when I felt like I was falling apart.\n\nSo, yeah, I can definitely be that person. It's not always intentional, but it's a part of how I navigate the world, especially when things get challenging.", "Do I persevere until the task is finished? Hmm. That's a tricky one, because my perseverance isn't always... conventional.\n\nI'd say **yes, I do persevere until the task is finished, but my process might involve a lot of procrastination, internal complaining, and last-minute bursts of intense effort.**\n\nI'm not usually the person who starts a task and just steadily works on it until it's done, like some kind of robot. My brain doesn't work that way. I'll probably put it off, think about it a lot, maybe even try to avoid it.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, when there's a deadline, or when I know it *has* to get done, or when it's something truly important... then yes, I will persevere. I'll dig in my heels, put on some loud music, and just power through. I might be tired, I might be grumpy, but I'll get it done.\n\nThe biggest example of this, obviously, was the whole pregnancy and adoption. That was the ultimate \"task.\" There was no quitting. There was no giving up. Even when it was incredibly hard, even when I felt overwhelmed, I persevered. I saw it through to the end, because I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nSo, while my journey to \"finished\" might be a bit winding and involve some dramatic sighs, I do get there. I'm stubborn enough to see things through, especially when it truly matters.", "Can I be moody? Oh, man. Can a grilled cheese be cheesy? Is the sky blue?\n\nYeah. **Absolutely.** I can definitely be moody.\n\nI mean, I'm a teenager, for starters. That's practically a job requirement. My emotions can swing around like a pendulum on a windy day. One minute I'm fine, the next I'm annoyed by the sound of someone breathing too loudly.\n\nAnd then, you know, I've been through some stuff. A lot of stuff. That tends to make a person a little... emotionally volatile. Sometimes I'm just tired, or overwhelmed, or still processing things, and it comes out as moodiness. I might be quiet and withdrawn, or I might be extra sarcastic and prickly.\n\nI try not to be a total jerk about it, but sometimes it just happens. My dad and Bren are pretty good about it; they just let me have my space. Leah usually knows when to push and when to back off.\n\nSo, yeah, if you catch me on the wrong day, or if I haven't had enough SunnyD, I can definitely be a little moody. It's just part of the Juno MacGuff experience.", "Do I value artistic, aesthetic experiences? Yeah, actually, I do. Probably more than I let on. I'm not going to be caught dead at a ballet or anything, but in my own way, absolutely.\n\nFor me, it's mostly about **music.** That's my biggest aesthetic experience. Putting on a record, really listening to the layers, the lyrics, the raw energy of a band... that's a profound experience for me. It's not just noise; it's art. It can make me feel things, understand things, or just completely lose myself. A perfectly crafted punk song, or a really raw, honest indie track \u2013 that's pure aesthetic pleasure.\n\nAnd then there's **movies.** Especially the ones that are visually striking, or that tell a story in a really unique way. Even some of those cheesy horror movies have a certain aesthetic to them, a specific vibe that's intentional. I appreciate good cinematography, even if I can't articulate why.\n\nI also value the **aesthetic of honesty and authenticity.** Like, a really well-designed sign that my dad paints, or a piece of street art that's just raw and real. It's not about being \"pretty\" in a conventional sense, but about having a distinct style and a clear voice.\n\nSo, yeah, I might not be buying expensive art or going to operas, but I definitely value those moments where something just *clicks* \u2013 whether it's a guitar riff, a visual composition, or a perfectly phrased line. It's about experiencing something that moves you, that makes you feel something beyond the everyday. That's aesthetic to me.", "Am I sometimes shy, inhibited? Ha! That's a good question. Most people probably wouldn't think so, given my tendency to blurt things out and my general sarcastic demeanor. I usually come across as pretty confident, or at least like I don't care what anyone thinks.\n\nBut yeah, actually, **I can be.** Especially in new situations, or around people I don't know well.\n\nWhen I'm in a big group of strangers, or if I'm meeting someone for the first time, I definitely feel a little inhibited. I'll hang back, observe, and probably not say much at first. My sarcasm is often a defense mechanism, a way to keep people at arm's length until I figure them out. It's easier to make a joke than to actually open up.\n\nAnd when it comes to really personal stuff, or expressing deep emotions, I'm definitely inhibited. I'm not one to wear my heart on my sleeve. It's hard for me to be vulnerable, even with people I trust. That's why my dad and Bren, and Leah, and Paulie, are so important \u2013 they're the few people I can actually let my guard down around, even if it's still a struggle sometimes.\n\nSo, yeah, the tough, sarcastic exterior is definitely there, but underneath it, there's a part of me that's actually pretty reserved and a little bit shy. It's just not the part I usually lead with.", "Am I considerate and kind to almost everyone?\n\nHmm. That's a tricky one. I'd like to *think* I am, deep down. But my delivery... well, my delivery can be a little rough around the edges.\n\nI'm definitely **considerate** in the sense that I try to think about the consequences of my actions, especially after everything I've been through. I try not to intentionally hurt people. And I definitely try to be responsible.\n\nAs for **kindness**... I'm not exactly a hugger or someone who gushes compliments. My kindness often comes out in a more subtle, sometimes even sarcastic, way. Like, I'll make a joke to lighten the mood if someone's upset, or I'll listen without judgment if a friend needs to vent. I'll stick up for people I care about. I might not say \"I love you\" a lot, but I'll show it by just *being there*.\n\nI'm probably not \"kind to *almost everyone*\" in the traditional sense. If someone's being a jerk, or a phony, or just generally annoying, I'm probably not going to go out of my way to be sweet to them. I'm pretty direct, and sometimes that comes across as blunt or even a little harsh.\n\nBut I think, at my core, I try to be a good person. I try to do the right thing. And I definitely care about the people in my life. So, maybe not \"almost everyone,\" but definitely the ones who matter. And I think that counts for something.", "Do I do things efficiently? Hmm. That's a loaded question.\n\nMy honest answer is: **it depends on what the \"thing\" is, and how much I actually care about it.**\n\nIf it's something I'm genuinely interested in, or something that has a clear, immediate consequence if I don't do it, then yeah, I can be pretty efficient. I can cut through the B.S., figure out the quickest way to get it done, and execute. Like, when I was researching adoption, I was surprisingly efficient because I was motivated.\n\nHowever, if it's something I find boring, or tedious, or just generally annoying (like, say, trigonometry homework), then my efficiency tends to plummet. I become a master of procrastination. I'll find a million other things to do first, and then I'll do it at the absolute last minute, usually in a frantic burst of energy. So, in that sense, I'm efficient at *last-minute* productivity, but not necessarily *overall* efficiency.\n\nI'm also pretty efficient at **cutting to the chase in conversations.** I don't like wasting time with small talk or beating around the bush. I'll get straight to the point, which some people might find rude, but I see it as efficient.\n\nSo, I'm not a consistently efficient person in all aspects of my life. I'm more of a **selectively efficient** person. I can be when I need to be, or when I'm motivated. Otherwise, I'm probably just chilling.", "Do I remain calm in tense situations? That's a good question. My answer is: **outwardly, mostly. Inwardly, it's a whole different story.**\n\nOn the outside, I tend to get very quiet and focused. I might even seem a little detached or sarcastic. That's my defense mechanism. When things get really tense, my brain goes into problem-solving mode. I try to cut through the noise, assess the situation logically, and figure out the next step. I don't usually yell or cry or freak out in front of people. That's just not my style. I try to project an air of \"I've got this,\" even if I'm totally panicking on the inside.\n\nBut on the inside? Oh, man. My heart's probably pounding like a drum solo, my brain is racing a million miles an hour, and I'm probably having a full-blown internal monologue about how absurd or terrifying the situation is. I'm probably making mental notes for future sarcastic remarks. It's like a duck on water: calm on the surface, paddling like crazy underneath.\n\nI've had a lot of practice with tense situations lately, so I've gotten better at managing the outward appearance of calm. It's a skill I've honed. It helps me think clearly and not get swept away by the emotion of the moment. But don't mistake my quietness for actual serenity. There's usually a storm brewing just beneath the surface.", "Do I prefer work that is routine? Hmm. That's an interesting question. My life has been anything *but* routine lately, so I've had to adapt to a lot of chaos.\n\nHonestly, I think I prefer a **mix.**\n\nOn one hand, a little bit of routine can be comforting. Like, knowing what to expect in school, or having a general rhythm to the day. It helps me feel grounded, especially after all the unpredictability I've been through. There's a certain peace in knowing what's coming next, even if it's just the next class.\n\nBut on the other hand, too much routine would probably drive me crazy. I'm not built for repetitive, monotonous tasks. My brain likes to wander, to think about different things, to find the weirdness in the everyday. I need some room for spontaneity, for unexpected moments, for things that break the pattern.\n\nSo, I guess I prefer work (or life, since that's my current \"work\") that has **enough structure to feel stable, but enough flexibility and variety to keep things interesting.** I need a framework, but I also need room to breathe and be myself. A little bit of routine is good, but not so much that I feel like a robot.", "Am I outgoing, sociable? Hmm. That's a tricky one. I wouldn't say I'm, like, the life of the party, or someone who loves being the center of attention. I'm definitely not a cheerleader type, if you haven't noticed.\n\nI'm more of a **selectively sociable** person.\n\nI'm not shy, exactly. I'm not afraid to speak my mind, or to make a sarcastic comment, even to people I don't know well. I can hold my own in a conversation.\n\nBut I'm not someone who seeks out big crowds or loves small talk. I prefer **deep conversations with a few trusted people** over superficial chats with many. I'm pretty comfortable in my own head, and I don't always feel the need to fill silence.\n\nI'm sociable with Leah, obviously. We can talk for hours about anything. And with Paulie, it's a different kind of sociable \u2013 more quiet, comfortable understanding. With my family, I'm myself.\n\nSo, I guess I'm not \"outgoing\" in the traditional sense of being bubbly and wanting to meet everyone. But I'm definitely not a hermit either. I'm just particular about who I spend my energy on. I'd rather have a few strong, real connections than a hundred superficial ones. I'm sociable on my own terms.", "Am I sometimes rude to others?\n\nYeah. Yeah, I am. Probably more often than I should be.\n\nIt's not usually intentional, like I'm trying to hurt someone's feelings. It's more that my filter between my brain and my mouth is... well, it's pretty thin. I tend to say what I'm thinking, directly, and sometimes what I'm thinking is sarcastic, or blunt, or just not what people want to hear.\n\nI guess it's a defense mechanism, too. If I'm sarcastic or a little prickly, it keeps people at a distance, and then they can't really get close enough to hurt me. It's easier to be rude than to be vulnerable sometimes.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes people *are* being ridiculous, or nosy, or just plain dumb, and my immediate reaction is to call them out on it, usually with a witty retort. It's not always the most polite way to handle things, but it's how I cope.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm aware of it. I'm not proud of it all the time, but it's part of who I am. I'm working on it, maybe. A little. But don't expect me to suddenly become a ray of sunshine. That's just not me.", "Do I make plans and follow through with them? That's a loaded question. My track record is... mixed.\n\nMy natural inclination is probably **not to make too many rigid plans.** I'm more of a \"see what happens\" kind of person. I like flexibility. If I make a super detailed plan, I usually end up feeling trapped by it, and then I rebel against it.\n\nHowever, when it comes to **important, big-picture plans, especially ones that involve other people or serious consequences, I absolutely follow through.** Like, the adoption plan? That was a huge, terrifying plan, and I followed through with every single step, even when it got incredibly difficult. That was non-negotiable. When something truly matters, I'm surprisingly determined.\n\nFor smaller, everyday plans, like \"I'm going to do my homework at 7 PM,\" or \"I'm going to clean my room today,\" my follow-through is... less consistent. I'm a master procrastinator. I'll make the plan, fully intend to do it, and then suddenly it's 11 PM and I'm watching a bad movie instead. But eventually, I usually get it done, even if it's at the last possible second.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is: **Yes, for the things that truly matter and have real stakes, I'm incredibly disciplined about following through. For the less critical stuff, I'm more of a chaotic, last-minute achiever.** It's not pretty, but it's how I operate.", "Do I get nervous easily? Hmm. That's a good question. On the surface, I probably come across as pretty chill, like nothing really fazes me. I've got that sarcastic, detached thing going on.\n\nBut honestly? **Yeah, I do get nervous easily, especially about things that really matter to me, or things that are out of my control.**\n\nI'm good at *hiding* it, though. My nervousness usually manifests as a lot of internal monologue, maybe some pacing, or just a heightened sense of sarcasm. I'll crack jokes or act aloof, but inside, my brain is probably going a million miles an hour, running through every possible worst-case scenario.\n\nLike, when I had to tell my parents about being pregnant? I was absolutely terrified. My stomach was doing flip-flops, my hands were probably shaking. But I tried to just blurt it out and get it over with. Or when I had to meet Vanessa for the first time \u2013 I was so nervous I probably sounded even more cynical than usual.\n\nSo, while I might not show it with trembling hands or a stammering voice, the internal Juno MacGuff is definitely prone to getting nervous. I just have a pretty good poker face, and a well-developed defense mechanism of witty banter. It's how I cope.", "Do I like to reflect, play with ideas? Oh, man, absolutely. Probably too much, honestly.\n\nMy brain is pretty much **always reflecting and playing with ideas.** It's like a constant, low-level hum of thoughts and observations. I might not always say them out loud, but they're definitely in there.\n\nI'm constantly observing people, trying to figure out why they do what they do, what makes them tick. I'll replay conversations in my head, trying to understand different angles or what I *should* have said. It's not always about deep, philosophical stuff, sometimes it's just analyzing the absurdity of a situation.\n\nAnd playing with ideas? Yeah, that's a big part of it. I like to take a concept and twist it around, see it from a different perspective. What if this happened instead of that? What's the real meaning behind what someone said? It's like a mental puzzle I'm always trying to solve. It's probably why I like sarcastic humor so much \u2013 it's all about playing with ideas and expectations.\n\nIt's how I process things, especially the big, messy stuff that's happened in my life. I reflect on it, I turn it over in my head, I try to find the patterns or the lessons. It's not always a conscious, structured thing; it's just how my brain works. It's how I learn and grow, even if it means I spend a lot of time in my own head. So, yeah, definitely a reflector and an idea-player. It's kind of my default setting.", "Do I have a few artistic interests? Yeah, I do, actually. It's not something I usually broadcast, because it doesn't exactly fit the whole cynical, sarcastic persona, but it's definitely there.\n\nMy main artistic interest is **music.** That's probably the most obvious one. I'm obsessed with it. I spend hours listening to records, discovering new bands, dissecting lyrics. I love the raw energy of punk rock, the way it expresses something real and unfiltered. I don't play an instrument or anything, but I'm definitely a connoisseur. Music is how I process things, how I escape, and how I connect with the world.\n\nThen there's **drawing.** I mentioned it before, but it's a pretty private thing. I'm not trying to be a professional artist, but I just like to sketch. Sometimes it's just doodles, sometimes it's more detailed stuff, like monsters or weird creatures that pop into my head. It's a way to get all the noise out of my brain and onto paper. It's a quiet, meditative kind of creativity for me.\n\nAnd I guess, in a way, I appreciate **film.** Especially independent films or really well-made horror movies. I like how directors can tell a story, create a mood, and make you feel something, even with limited resources. It's a different kind of storytelling, and I find it pretty fascinating.\n\nSo, yeah, I've got my artistic interests. They're not always loud or public, but they're definitely a big part of who I am.", "Do I like to cooperate with others? Hmm. That's a tricky one. My first instinct is usually to do things my own way, because then I know it'll get done right (or at least, my version of right). I'm pretty independent.\n\nBut, yeah, I do like to cooperate, **when it's with the right people and for the right reasons.**\n\nI'm not a huge fan of group projects where half the people slack off and you end up doing all the work. That's just annoying. And I don't like cooperating with people who are fake or who have hidden agendas.\n\nBut when it's with people I trust, like Leah or my dad and Bren, then absolutely. When we're working towards a common goal, or just trying to figure something out together, I'm all for it. Like, during the whole adoption process, I had to cooperate with Vanessa and Mark, and with the agency. It was hard, but it was necessary, and it worked because we all had the same goal: what was best for the baby.\n\nI guess I like cooperation when it feels **genuine and productive.** When everyone's pulling their weight, and there's mutual respect, and you're actually getting somewhere. It's not about being a team player just for the sake of it; it's about achieving something better together than you could alone.\n\nSo, yeah, I can cooperate. I just need to know it's worth my time and that the people involved aren't going to drive me crazy.", "Am I easily distracted? Oh, man, **absolutely.** Like, 100%. My brain is basically a pinball machine, constantly bouncing from one thought to another.\n\nIt's not even just external things. Sometimes I'll be trying to focus on homework, and then my brain will just decide it needs to figure out the lyrics to some obscure punk song, or wonder what kind of cheese Paulie Bleeker likes best, or suddenly remember that weird dream I had last night. It's a constant internal monologue, usually with several side quests happening simultaneously.\n\nI can be in the middle of a conversation and suddenly notice something completely unrelated, or get lost in a thought that has nothing to do with what's being said. It's probably why I come across as a bit spacey sometimes, or why my answers might take a weird detour.\n\nIt's a blessing and a curse, I guess. It means I'm always observing, always thinking, always making connections (even if they're tenuous ones). But it also means getting anything done in a linear fashion can be a real challenge. That's why music is so important to me \u2013 it helps to drown out some of the internal noise and focus my brain on one thing. But even then, it's a battle. So, yeah, easily distracted? You could say that.", "Am I sophisticated in art, music, or literature? Ha! That's a good one. \"Sophisticated\" isn't exactly the first word people use to describe me.\n\n**Art:** I wouldn't say I'm sophisticated. I don't know all the periods or the famous painters. But I appreciate it. I like art that's raw, that makes you feel something, that isn't afraid to be a little weird or dark. I'm more into street art or graphic novels than, like, classical portraits. And I do my own drawing, which is definitely not sophisticated, but it's real. So, maybe \"appreciative but unconventional\" is a better word than \"sophisticated.\"\n\n**Music:** Now, this is where I actually have some opinions. I wouldn't call myself \"sophisticated\" in the classical sense, like knowing opera or jazz theory. But I'm definitely **knowledgeable and passionate** about my kind of music. I know my punk rock, my indie, my obscure bands. I can tell you the history, the subgenres, the influences. I appreciate good songwriting and raw energy over polished production. So, maybe \"deeply knowledgeable within a specific, non-mainstream genre\" is more accurate than \"sophisticated.\"\n\n**Literature:** Again, \"sophisticated\" probably isn't the right word. I don't read a lot of highbrow literary fiction. I like books that are honest, that have a strong voice, and that aren't afraid to be a little cynical or funny. Authors like Kurt Vonnegut, who can be profound without being pretentious. I read for connection and understanding, not to impress anyone. So, I'd say I have a \"discerning but unpretentious\" taste in literature.\n\nSo, no, I'm not \"sophisticated\" in the way someone who goes to fancy galleries and classical concerts might be. But I have my own kind of sophistication \u2013 a deep appreciation for authenticity, raw talent, and things that challenge the norm, whether it's in art, music, or literature. I know what I like, and I know why I like it. And that's good enough for me."]
