The number in the second column is the **PID** (like `12345`).  \n\n2. **Kill it**:  \n   Use the `kill` command:  \n   ```bash\n   kill 12345\n   ```  \n   Replace `12345` with the actual PID.  \n\n   If it doesn\u2019t die, try:  \n   ```bash\n   kill -9 12345\n   ```  \n   (The `-9` sends a *force kill*. Use only if it\u2019s stuck.)  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcbb If you\u2019re in a Jupyter notebook or IDE:  \n- **Jupyter**: Click the \u201cStop\u201d button (the square icon) in the notebook toolbar.  \n- **VS Code / PyCharm / etc.**: Look for a \u201cStop\u201d or \u201cTerminate\u201d button in the debugger panel.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f If you\u2019re in a script and want to kill it *from within Python*:  \nAdd this to your code (for testing):  \n```python\nimport os\nimport signal\nimport sys\n\n# This will kill the current process\nos.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGTERM)\n```\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Use this only if you *really* want to stop the script.

Look for **QoS (Quality of Service)** or **Bandwidth Control**.  \n3. **Set a limit** on downloads\u2014like 50% of your total speed.  \n   - Example: If you have 100 Mbps, cap downloads at 50 Mbps.  \n4. **Prioritize** things like video calls, gaming, or browsing.  \n   - That way, Zoom doesn\u2019t freeze while your download chugs along.  \n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **On Your Device (The Easy Way)**  \n- **Pause downloads** when you\u2019re streaming, gaming, or video calling.  \n- Use **built-in limits** in apps:  \n  - **BitTorrent?** Set a download speed cap in the app.  \n  - **Chrome?** Use extensions like *Download Manager* to pause or limit.  \n  - **Windows?** Use *Resource Monitor* to throttle background downloads.  \n\n### \ud83c\udf10 **The Real Talk**  \n- **Your ISP might be throttling you anyway.**  \n  - If you\u2019re on a \u201cunlimited\u201d plan, they might slow you down after 100 GB.  \n  - Use a speed test (like speedtest.net) during a download. If it drops from 100 Mbps to 10 Mbps?  \n    \u2192 You\u2019re being throttled.  \n- **Upgrade your plan.**  \n  - If you\u2019re constantly maxing out your bandwidth, maybe you need more.  \n  - But don\u2019t just buy faster\u2014*manage it*.  \n\n### \u2705 **Bottom Line**  \nThrottling downloads doesn\u2019t *improve* speed.  \nIt *protects* it.  \nSo:  \n- **Limit downloads** when you need speed for something else.  \n- **Use QoS** on your router.  \n- **Pause big downloads** when you\u2019re streaming or calling.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re still slow?  \nIt\u2019s probably not the download.  \nIt\u2019s your router, your Wi-Fi, or your ISP.  \n\nBut hey\u2014  \nif you\u2019re just trying to watch a movie without buffering?  \nJust pause the download.  \nIt\u2019s not rocket science.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re still stuck?  \nJust say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

Stuffing leaking.  \nLike Sir Fluffington III.  \n\nAnd whisper:  \n*\u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d*  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t how hard you crush it.  \nIt\u2019s *why*.  \n\nAnd if you do it quietly?  \nIf you do it like you\u2019re not trying to be anything?  \nThen you\u2019ve already won.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nYou don\u2019t need a tool.  \nYou don\u2019t need a plan.  \nYou don\u2019t even need to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \n\nJust hold it.  \nSqueeze.  \nLet it go.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nYou\u2019re not crushing a can.  \nYou\u2019re *choosing*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *bed bugs*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some quick fix with a spray and a prayer.  \n\nNo.  \n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with bed bugs\u2014*real* ones, not just a \u201cI think I saw a bug\u201d panic\u2014then you\u2019re not just fighting pests.  \nYou\u2019re fighting a *war*.  \n\nAnd here\u2019s the truth:  \nYou can\u2019t \u201cannihilate\u201d them with a single spray.  \nYou can\u2019t \u201cget rid of them\u201d in a weekend.  \nBut you *can* win.  \n\nHere\u2019s how\u2014no fluff, no nonsense:  \n\n---\n\n### **1. Don\u2019t panic.**  \nYes, they\u2019re gross. Yes, they bite.  \nBut they\u2019re not a death sentence.  \nThey\u2019re *manageable*.  \nAnd the first thing you do?  \n*Stop*.  \nBreathe.  \nThen *act*.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Confirm it\u2019s bed bugs.**  \nNot every red bump is a bed bug.  \nNot every tiny bug is a bed bug.  \nLook for:  \n- Tiny, flat, reddish-brown bugs (about the size of an apple seed).  \n- Dark spots (bed bug droppings) on sheets or mattress seams.  \n- Tiny white eggs or molted skins.  \n- A musty, sweetish smell (like almonds or old books).  \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure?  \nTake a photo.  \nSend it to a pest control pro.  \nDon\u2019t guess.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Declutter.**  \nBed bugs love hiding in clutter.  \nSo:  \n- Clear everything off the floor.  \n- Get rid of old clothes, books, boxes.  \n- Put everything in sealed plastic bags.  \n- *No* \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it later.\u201d  \n*Now*.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Wash everything in hot water.**  \n- Sheets, pillowcases, blankets, clothes\u2014*all of it*.  \n- Wash at **120\u00b0F (49\u00b0C) or higher**.  \n- Dry on *high heat* for at least 30 minutes.  \n- If something can\u2019t be washed?  \n  \u2192 Seal it in a plastic bag and freeze it for **4 days**.  \n\n---\n\n### **5. Vacuum like your life depends on it.**  \n- Use a vacuum with a *crevice tool*.  \n- Vacuum every inch of the mattress, box spring, bed frame, headboard, baseboards, furniture.  \n- *Immediately* seal the vacuum bag in a plastic bag and throw it in the trash\u2014*outside*.  \n- Don\u2019t just vacuum. *Destroy*.  \n\n---\n\n### **6. Use heat.**  \nBed bugs die at **118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C)**.  \nSo:  \n- Use a clothes dryer on high heat for 30 minutes.  \n- Use a heat gun (carefully!) on cracks and crevices.  \n- Or\u2014*best option*\u2014hire a professional with industrial heat treatment.  \n\n---\n\n### **7. Seal the cracks.**  \nBed bugs hide in tiny spaces.  \nSo:  \n- Use caulk to seal cracks in walls, baseboards, outlets.  \n- Use mattress encasements (like a *zippered, bug-proof* cover).  \n- Put bed legs in glass or plastic cups (bed bug \u201ctraps\u201d).  \n\n---\n\n### **8. Call a pro.**  \nThis is not a DIY job.  \nNot unless you\u2019re ready to spend *weeks* and *thousands* of dollars.  \nA licensed pest control expert has:  \n- Heat treatment.  \n- Insecticides that actually work.  \n- Experience.  \n- The tools.  \n\nAnd yes, it costs money.  \nBut it\u2019s cheaper than replacing your entire bedroom.  \n\n---\n\n### **9. Don\u2019t give up.**  \nBed bugs don\u2019t go away in a week.  \nThey take **weeks to months**.  \nYou\u2019ll see bugs for a while.  \nYou\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re losing.  \nBut keep going.  \nKeep cleaning.  \nKeep sealing.  \nKeep treating.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final truth:**  \nYou can\u2019t \u201cannihilate\u201d bed bugs with a spray.  \nYou can\u2019t \u201cget rid of them\u201d with a single step.  \nBut you *can* win.  \n\nNot by being perfect.  \nNot by being lucky.  \nBut by being *consistent*.  \nBy being *brutal*.  \nBy being *relentless*.  \n\nAnd when you finally see the last one?  \nYou\u2019ll know\u2014  \nyou didn\u2019t just kill bugs.  \nYou *survived*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real victory.  \n\nNow go.  \nVacuum.  \nWash.  \nCall a pro.  \nAnd don\u2019t let them win.  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this.  \nEven if you\u2019re not okay.  \nEven if you\u2019re scared.  \nEven if you\u2019re tired.  \n\nJust keep going.  \n\nBecause you\u2019re not alone.  \nAnd you\u2019re not broken.  \nYou\u2019re just fighting.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *rats in the attic*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some kind of pest control expert.

Find the entrance.**  \nRats don\u2019t just appear.  \nThey come in through cracks.  \nGaps in the siding.  \nLoose shingles.  \nA hole the size of a quarter.  \nSo go up there.  \nUse a flashlight.  \nLook.  \nListen.  \nAnd when you find it\u2014*don\u2019t panic*.  \nJust mark it.  \n\n**3. Seal it.**  \nNot with tape.  \nNot with cotton.  \nUse steel wool.  \nOr metal mesh.  \nBecause rats chew through plastic.  \nThey chew through wood.  \nThey chew through *everything*.  \nBut steel wool?  \nThat\u2019s their kryptonite.  \n\n**4. Don\u2019t leave food.**  \nNo crumbs.  \nNo open bags.  \nNo trash.  \nRats aren\u2019t just looking for shelter.  \nThey\u2019re looking for *dinner*.  \nSo clean.  \nSeal.  \nLock.  \n\n**5. Set traps\u2014*but not the cruel ones*.**  \nI\u2019m not a fan of traps that hurt.  \nBut if you *must*\u2014use a live trap.  \nCatch them.  \nTake them outside.  \nLet them go.  \nNot because I\u2019m soft.  \nBut because I believe in *choice*.  \nEven for rats.  \n\n**6.
