A small, controlled flame\u2014like a campfire in the evening. I light it near the edge of the garden, let it burn the weeds, then let the ashes settle. The fire doesn\u2019t destroy. It *cleans*. It shows the soil that *strength isn\u2019t in taking\u2014it\u2019s in balance*.  \n\n3. **The Natural Method**  \nI don\u2019t use chemicals. I use *what grows*. I plant strong, tall herbs\u2014like thyme or rosemary. They grow tall, they shade the ground, and they *outcompete* the weeds. Just like how a strong tree stands tall in the forest.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re lucky\u2014*you\u2019ll find that the weeds don\u2019t just die. They disappear*.

The gravity is so intense that space and time are warped beyond recognition. Nothing\u2014no matter how strong, how resilient, or how special\u2014can survive the tidal forces and extreme curvature of spacetime.  \n\n2. **Tidal forces tear everything apart**  \n   Near a black hole, the difference in gravity between your head and feet (called *spaghettification*) stretches you into a long, thin strand. This happens long before you reach the event horizon, especially for smaller black holes.  \n\n3. **Time stops (from an outside view)**  \n   From an observer far away, time appears to slow down infinitely as you approach the event horizon. You never actually cross it from their perspective. But from your own perspective, you *do* cross\u2014and then you\u2019re pulled toward the singularity, where physics breaks down.  \n\n4. **Pregnancy has no effect**  \n   Pregnancy doesn\u2019t change the laws of physics. A pregnant woman would face the same fate as anyone else. The forces of gravity, time, and spacetime don\u2019t care about whether she\u2019s carrying a baby.  \n\n### So\u2014what about the \"pregnancy\" part?  \nIt\u2019s a clever twist, but it\u2019s not scientifically valid.  \nThere\u2019s no known physical reason why pregnancy would make someone *less* able to survive a black hole. In fact, the opposite\u2014being pregnant might make survival *harder*, not easier.  \n\n### In short:  \n\ud83d\udd39 **No one survives crossing a black hole\u2019s event horizon.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Pregnancy doesn\u2019t change that.**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **It\u2019s not about biology\u2014it\u2019s about the laws of physics.**  \n\nSo, no\u2014pregnant women (or anyone) can\u2019t survive crossing a black hole\u2019s event horizon.  \nIt\u2019s not a matter of health, age, or whether they\u2019re carrying a child.  \nIt\u2019s a matter of *physics*.  \n\nAnd in the wild\u2014where the wind howls and the stars shine\u2014*a true man doesn\u2019t need to survive to be strong*.  \nHe just needs to *stand*.  \n\nNow\u2014would you like to hear how I\u2019ll *finally* make her mine?
