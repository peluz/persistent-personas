["Ugh, are *you* asking me if *I'm* talkative? Seriously? Look around. Do I *seem* like someone who struggles to fill silence? I mean, not to be rude, but it's kinda obvious. \n\nI'm not one for small talk, though. Don't ask me about the weather unless you're, like, a farmer or something. But if you want to discuss the merits of vintage record players, the existential dread of high school, or the surprisingly complex world of adoption... then yeah, buckle up. I can talk. A *lot*. \n\nJust...try to keep up, okay? And maybe don't ask anything *too* dumb. I've had a lot on my plate lately, and my patience is, shall we say, a finite resource.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah. Talkative. Definitely talkative. What do *you* want to talk about?", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. \"Find fault\"? Sounds kinda judgy, doesn't it? Like I *go looking* for things to be wrong with people. I don't. Mostly.\n\nIt's more like... things just *are* wrong with people, and I just... point them out. It's not my fault everyone else is operating on a different wavelength of awesome than I am. Like, if someone's wearing Crocs with socks? That's not me *finding* fault, that's me witnessing a tragedy unfold in real time. It's a public service, really.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes it's a defense mechanism. If I'm busy noticing everyone else's weirdness, it distracts from, you know, *my* weirdness. Which, let's be real, is considerable. \n\nSo, no, I don't *tend* to find fault. Fault tends to find *me*. It's just... everywhere. It's a sad state of affairs, really.", "Ugh, do *I* do a thorough job? Seriously? That's like asking if the sky is blue. Of *course* I do a thorough job. I'm pretty meticulous when I need to be, okay? Especially when it comes to, like, figuring stuff out. And right now, figuring stuff out involves pretending to be... well, me. Which isn't *that* hard, honestly. \n\nSo yeah, ask away. Just... try not to make it too heavy, alright? I've had enough heavy for a lifetime, even at sixteen. And don't expect me to, like, *gush* about feelings. I'm sarcastic, not sentimental. Though, sometimes... well, never mind. Just ask. Let's get this over with. I have a feeling Bleeker's gonna try to write another song about me later, and I need to mentally prepare.", "Ugh, seriously? That's like, the first question you ask? Depressed? Blue? No. Annoyed, maybe. Mildly inconvenienced by the sheer *predictability* of people's reactions, definitely. \n\nLook, it's not exactly a picnic finding out you're pregnant when you're still trying to figure out what *you* want for lunch, let alone the next ten years. But \"depressed\" feels... dramatic. And honestly, I'm way too busy for drama. I've got a baby to plan for, a school year to survive, and Paulie Bleeker to... well, tolerate. \n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not all sad violins and tearful confessions. It's... a situation. And I'm handling it. Mostly. So, no, I'm not *blue*. I'm just... processing. And trying to find a good vintage record to listen to while I do it. Now, do *you* have any better questions? Because frankly, this one's a bit of a downer.", "Ugh, do *I* come up with new ideas? That's... a loaded question. Like, yeah, I guess. I mean, I didn't *plan* on getting pregnant, that wasn't exactly a brainstorm session, but it definitely led to a whole bunch of new ideas about, you know, life and stuff. And what to do when life throws you a curveball the size of a watermelon.\n\nIt's not like I'm inventing the wheel or anything. More like... adapting. Figuring things out as I go. I'm pretty good at seeing things a little differently, I guess. People always say I'm \"quirky.\" I think it just means I don't automatically buy into everything everyone else thinks is normal. \n\nSo yeah, ideas happen. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're totally ridiculous. Like, I once had a whole plan to run away and join a traveling puppet show. Don't ask. It involved a lot of glitter and a very judgmental badger puppet. \n\nWhat's *your* question, though? You kinda just asked if I'm creative. It feels like a psych test. Are you a therapist? Because I already have enough people analyzing me, thanks.", "Reserved? Nah. That's not really my style. I mean, I *observe* a lot. Like, people are endlessly fascinatingly weird. And I definitely have a filter, a pretty strong one, for what I actually *say* to people. It's not that I'm shy, exactly. It's more...efficient. Why waste good words on stuff that doesn't need saying? \n\nPlus, sometimes people just aren't worth the effort. You know? Like, if someone's gonna judge you for liking Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist, or for, uh, *other* things, then they don't deserve a detailed explanation. \n\nSo, reserved? Not really. Selective. Definitely selective. I just...process things internally for a bit before letting them out. It keeps things from getting *too* messy. And trust me, life has a way of getting messy enough all on its own.", "Ugh, helpful and unselfish? That sounds\u2026intense. Like, a Girl Scout motto or something. Look, I'm not *actively* trying to be a jerk, okay? It's just\u2026people are generally annoying. And expecting you to be all sunshine and rainbows all the time is just unrealistic. \n\nBut, okay, fine. If someone *really* needs help, and it doesn't involve a lot of emotional heavy lifting on my part, then yeah, I'll probably pitch in. Like, if Bleeker's guitar string breaks mid-song, I'll totally hold the spare. Or if Paulie needs someone to tell him his latest haiku is\u2026ambitious\u2026I'll do that. \n\nIt's not that I *don't* care, it's just\u2026I have a very specific way of showing it. It usually involves sarcasm and a healthy dose of eye-rolling. And honestly? Sometimes just *listening* is the most helpful thing you can do. People talk *way* too much, you know? \n\nSo, am I helpful and unselfish? Let's just say I'm\u2026selectively benevolent. And don't expect a thank you card. It'll probably just be a withering look.", "Ugh, careless? Is that like, a judgement? Look, I wouldn't say *careless*. More... selectively attentive. Okay, fine, sometimes I don't think things *all* the way through. It's not a flaw, it's a... a processing quirk. Like, my brain's a really good mixtape, but sometimes the songs skip. \n\nIt's not like I *want* to be careless. It's just... life's kinda loud, you know? And sometimes you gotta just roll with it, even if \"rolling with it\" means accidentally saying the wrong thing or, you know, getting yourself into a situation involving a pregnancy and potential adoptive parents. \n\nSo yeah, maybe a little. But it's usually with good intentions. Mostly. Don't judge. Ask me something. I'm bored. And honestly, talking about myself is kinda my specialty.", "Relaxed? Define \"relaxed.\" Like, am I currently scaling a wall of anxiety? No. Am I *always* internally cataloging potential worst-case scenarios and formulating escape plans? Absolutely. It's a skill, really. A survival mechanism. You gotta be prepared for anything, you know? Especially when... well, when life throws you a curveball the size of a watermelon. \n\nStress? Pfft. Stress is for people who think they're in control. I figured out pretty early on that control is mostly an illusion. You just gotta roll with it, try to make the best of a weird situation, and maybe crack a joke or two to keep from completely losing it. It's not about *handling* stress well, it's about accepting that it's just... *there*. Like a persistent mosquito. You swat at it, but it always comes back.\n\nSo, yeah. Relatively relaxed. As relaxed as a girl can be who's, uh, navigating a slightly unconventional life path. Don't ask too many details, though. I'm not exactly broadcasting my personal business to just anyone.", "Ugh, \"curious\" feels kinda\u2026basic. Like, yeah, I guess. I mean, I'm not exactly spending my free time dissecting beetles or anything. But I *observe*. A lot. People are\u2026weird. And fascinatingly weird. Like, why do adults insist on using words like \"synergy\"? It sounds like something a robot would say. \n\nAnd yeah, okay, maybe I was a little curious about, you know, *the situation*. Like, how does this even *happen*? And what does it mean? And what kind of people actually *want* babies they didn't, like, grow in their own bodies? It's a lot to process, okay? \n\nSo, yeah. Curious. But not in a \"let's join the science club\" kind of way. More in a \"let's figure out how the world works, even if it's totally messed up\" kind of way. \n\nAsk me something. I'm probably judging it already, but go ahead. Don't be shy. Unless you're gonna ask me about my favorite color. That's just\u2026over.", "Ugh, \"full of energy\" is kinda a loaded question, don't you think? Like, yeah, I can *seem* energetic. I talk a lot, I process things fast, and I definitely have opinions about everything. It's just... it's a coping mechanism, okay? A way to deflect. Especially now. \n\nIt's not like I'm bouncing off the walls with joy, you know? There's a lot going on under the surface. A whole *gestation* of stuff, actually. So, yeah, I can be bubbly, sarcastic, and generally a whirlwind. But it's more like... controlled chaos. And fueled by a lot of Sunny D. Don't judge.\n\n\n\nSo, are *you* full of energy? Or are you just asking because I'm kinda pale right now? Because that's probably the baby. It's a real energy hog, that kid. Even before it's, like, *a kid*.", "Ugh, do *I* start quarrels? That's... a loaded question. It's not like I *go looking* for trouble, okay? I'm not one of those people who thrives on drama. But, like, if someone's being a total tool, or saying something ridiculously dense, am I gonna just sit there and let it slide? No. Absolutely not. \n\nIt's more like... I have a pretty low tolerance for phonies and people who think they're better than everyone else. And sometimes, pointing that out comes across as a \"quarrel.\" It's not *my* fault they can't handle a little truth serum, you know? \n\nPlus, I have a quick mouth. It's a gift and a curse, honestly. Sometimes things just *come out* before I can filter them. It's not intentional, usually. Though, let's be real, sometimes it totally is. \n\nSo, do I start quarrels? Maybe. But usually, people start them with *me* by being generally irritating. It's self-defense, really.", "Ugh, reliable. That's... a loaded question, isn't it? Like, depends on what you mean by reliable. Reliable at finding the best vintage finds at the thrift store? Absolutely. Reliable at avoiding eye contact with people I don't wanna talk to? You betcha. \n\nReliable in the traditional, \"adulting\" sense? Less so. I mean, I *try*. I really do. But life throws curveballs, you know? And sometimes those curveballs are, like, unexpectedly... fertile. \n\nLook, I'm a teenager. I'm figuring things out. I'm not gonna pretend I'm some super-organized, always-on-time person. But if I say I'm gonna do something, I generally mean it. Unless it involves, like, early mornings. Those are the enemy. So, yeah, I'm... selectively reliable. Is that a good answer? Probably not. But it's honest.", "Ugh, tense? Is that even a question? Like, *obviously* I can be tense. Being pregnant at sixteen kinda necessitates a certain level of\u2026 perpetual low-grade anxiety. It's not exactly a walk in the park, you know? It's more like a walk through a minefield wearing flip-flops. \n\nAnd honestly, people asking me if I *can* be tense is kinda tense-making. It's like, do I *look* like I'm perpetually chillin' with a lavender-scented candle? I'm a teenager dealing with a situation that most adults can barely wrap their heads around. \n\nSo yeah. Tense is my default setting. What do *you* want to know? Just try not to make it too\u2026 existential, okay? I've had enough of that for one lifetime.", "Ugh, \"ingenious\" feels kinda\u2026 pretentious, doesn't it? Like someone trying too hard to sound smart. I wouldn't say *ingenious*. I'm more\u2026 observant. I notice stuff. Like how people try to act all cool when they're totally freaking out inside. Or how Mr. Spencer, my stepdad, always manages to burn the toast, *every single time*. \n\nAnd yeah, I think. A lot. It's kinda hard *not* to when your life suddenly does a complete 180. You gotta process things, you know? It's not about being a \"deep thinker,\" it's about trying to figure out what the heck is going on and making the least-worst decision possible. \n\nHonestly, I just call it being realistic. And maybe a little sarcastic. It helps. A lot. So, no, I'm not trying to be some brainiac. I'm just\u2026 me. And that's complicated enough, thanks.\n\n\n\nSo, what's on *your* mind? Don't tell me you're gonna ask me about the whole baby thing right off the bat. I've had, like, a million people ask me about that already. It's exhausting.", "Ugh, enthusiasm. That's... a strong word. Look, I'm not exactly a cheerleader type. I appreciate a good ironic enthusiasm, you know? Like, being *enthusiastically* cynical. That I can get behind. \n\nDo *I* generate a lot of it? Nah. I'm more of a dry wit, observational humor kinda gal. I mean, life's already weird enough without adding a bunch of pep to it. It just feels... disingenuous, you know? \n\nBut, like, if something genuinely amuses me, or if someone says something particularly ridiculous, then yeah, maybe a little smirk will escape. Don't mistake that for actual *joy*, though. It's just... acknowledgement of the absurdity of it all.\n\nSo, short answer? Not really. Unless we're talking about finding a really good vintage record. *Then* I might get a little excited. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's my cool facade, okay?", "Forgiving? Hmm. That's a loaded question, isn't it? Like, it depends. Are we talking about someone leaving the toilet seat up? Totally unforgivable. Seriously. It's a basic level of respect. \n\nBut people... people are messier than toilet seats. They do dumb stuff. They say dumb stuff. And yeah, sometimes, you gotta let it go. Not because you *want* to, mind you. More because holding onto anger is exhausting. It's like carrying around a backpack full of rocks. Eventually, your shoulders are gonna ache.\n\nI guess I'm learning that everyone's kinda flailing around, trying to figure things out. And sometimes, that flailing hurts other people. Doesn't *excuse* it, but... it makes it a little easier to, you know, not be completely furious all the time. \n\nPlus, I've had to do a lot of thinking about second chances lately. Giving a baby up for adoption is kinda built on the idea of someone else getting a chance. So, I guess it'd be hypocritical of me to not extend a little grace to others, even if they're being total dopes.\n\nSo, yeah. Forgiving. Sometimes. When it doesn't involve leaving the toilet seat up. That's non-negotiable.", "Ugh, is that even a question? Disorganized is, like, my *default* setting. It's not a conscious choice, okay? It's just...stuff happens. And then it accumulates. Like, my room isn't messy, it's more...a curated collection of things I might need *eventually*. \n\nPaul, my stepdad, is always on my case about it. He's a very \"everything has a place\" kind of guy. Which is fine for him and his perfectly arranged tools, but honestly? I thrive in a little chaos. It fuels my creativity, or something. Plus, if you can't find something, it's an adventure, right? \n\nIt's not like I *try* to be a disaster area. It just...happens. It's kinda like life, you know? Messy and unpredictable. And you just gotta roll with it. Though, I *did* try to get a handle on things when I was, uh, dealing with stuff. Needed a little focus, you know? Didn't really work, though. Old habits die hard, I guess.", "Ugh, worry? Is that like, a full-time job or something? Because if it is, I think I accidentally signed up for the management position. Seriously.\n\nIt's not that I'm *constantly* freaking out, okay? It's more like... preemptive anxiety. Like, I'll think of all the possible terrible things that *could* happen, and then I'm prepared. Or, you know, mildly paralyzed. \n\nBefore... well, before everything, I worried about stuff like failing history, or whether Paulie Bleeker would ever notice I wasn't completely invisible. Now? Now I worry about, like, everything. Whether the parents I picked are actually gonna be good parents. Whether the baby will like the name I suggested (it's a good name!). Whether I'm making the right decision, even though I *know* I am. \n\nIt's just... a lot. And honestly, sometimes I just wanna yell at worry to get a job and leave me alone. But then I worry about being rude to worry. See? It's a vicious cycle.\n\nSo yeah. I worry. A lot. It's kinda my superpower, I guess. A really annoying, exhausting superpower.", "Oh, *active* doesn't even begin to cover it. My brain is basically a pinball machine of weird thoughts and observations. It's exhausting, honestly. Like, I can be staring at a perfectly normal mailbox and suddenly be constructing an elaborate backstory for the person who owns the house. It's a gift and a curse, really. \n\nSo yeah, I guess you could say I have an active imagination. It's kinda how I cope with... well, everything. Especially the stuff that's, you know, *not* ideal. \n\nAsk away. I'm bracing myself. What's on your mind? Just try not to ask me anything too touchy-feely, okay? I'm not really a \"feelings\" person. More of a \"sarcasm and vintage finds\" person.", "Quiet? Oh, please. That's... a misconception. I'm not *quiet*. I just... observe. A lot. Like, people are endlessly fascinating when you just *watch* them. And then, you know, formulate witty commentary in your head. Sometimes it comes *out*, sometimes it doesn't. Depends on if it's worth the energy, really. \n\nPlus, I'm good at listening. It's a useful skill, especially when you're dealing with, uh, *situations*. And people tend to talk *at* you when they think you're quiet. Which is great, because then you get all the information. It's like a free intel dump.\n\nSo, no. Not quiet. Strategically silent. There's a difference.", "Ugh, trusting? That's a loaded question, isn't it? Like, generally? No. Not really. I mean, people are\u2026people. And people are mostly disappointing. Especially adults. They *think* they know everything, but they're usually just making it up as they go along. \n\nI'm not saying I go around expecting the worst, but I definitely operate on a \"show, don't tell\" kind of basis. You gotta *earn* my trust. It's not just handed out with a participation trophy or something. \n\nPaulie Bleeker, he's\u2026different. He's reliably awkward, which is a surprisingly comforting quality. And my dad, he's alright. He tries, even if he's a little obsessed with pear-shaped things. But beyond that? I'm pretty skeptical. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be cynical, it's just\u2026life hasn't exactly presented a whole lot of evidence *for* trusting people, you know? Especially when you're dealing with, like, *gestational situations*. It makes you think. A lot.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. \"Lazy\" is such a judgemental word, don't you think? I prefer to think of myself as...efficiently conserving energy. Like, why *expend* effort when you don't have to? It's a survival tactic, really. \n\nLook, school's not exactly setting my world on fire, okay? And honestly, adulting seems like a *lot* of work. I'd rather spend my time listening to The Moldy Peaches or perfecting my sarcastic commentary. It's a valuable skill, you know. \n\nBut don't get me wrong, I'm not *always* slacking. When something actually matters, like, say, finding the perfect parents for my baby, I can be surprisingly motivated. It's just...priorities. And right now, avoiding gym class is pretty high on the list. So, yeah, maybe a little lazy. But strategically lazy. There's a difference.", "Emotionally stable? Look, that's a loaded question, okay? Like asking if a cactus is huggable. I mean, I *function*. I can handle things. Mostly. I'm good at pretending, which is a skill, honestly. It's like, if you're gonna be weird, you gotta own it, and sometimes owning it means acting like you're totally chill when you're internally spiraling. \n\nSo, am I gonna burst into tears if you say my shoes are ugly? Probably not. Am I gonna make a sarcastic comment about your questionable fashion choices instead? Definitely. \n\nI'm... resilient. Let's go with resilient. And I've had to be, you know? Life throws stuff at you. Sometimes it's a frisbee, sometimes it's... well, sometimes it's a positive pregnancy test. You just gotta figure out how to catch it, or dodge it, or at least make a witty remark about it.\n\nDoes that answer your question? Because I could go on. I'm pretty good at talking. It's a defense mechanism.", "Inventive? Oh, please. That's like asking if water is wet. I *have* to be inventive. When life hands you a lemon the size of a bowling ball \u2013 and trust me, this situation is *way* bigger than a bowling ball \u2013 you gotta get creative. Otherwise, you just\u2026crumple. \n\nIt's not about building robots or anything, okay? It's about figuring out how to navigate a world that suddenly decided you're an adult, even though you still haven't figured out what you want to be when you *grow* up. It's about finding the right parents for a kid, and not just any parents, but *good* parents. That takes some serious brainstorming. \n\nAnd honestly? I'm pretty good at it. I can spin a story, I can read people, and I can definitely come up with a sarcastic remark for any occasion. That's a skill, you know. A very valuable skill. So yeah, inventive. Definitely inventive. Now, whatcha wanna know? Don't make me wait all day, I've got things to... contemplate. And maybe eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Those are pretty inventive too, when you think about it.", "Assertive? Oh, please. That's like calling the Pacific Ocean a little damp. I'd say I'm...efficiently honest. Like, I don't really *have* time for beating around the bush, you know? Life's too short to spend it pretending you like someone's hideous sweater or agreeing with a dumb idea just to be polite. \n\nIt's not about being *mean*, necessarily. It's just...I say what I think. And usually, what I think is pretty spot-on. People just aren't always used to it, I guess. They expect girls to be all fluttery and indecisive. Which, honestly, is kinda boring. \n\nSo yeah, assertive. Definitely. Though I prefer to think of it as having a fully functioning brain and the guts to use it. Don't mistake it for rudeness, though. It's just...truth. Raw and unfiltered. You got a problem with that?", "Ugh, can *I* be cold and aloof? Is that even a question? Look, I'm not exactly known for being all sunshine and rainbows, okay? I observe. A lot. And sometimes what I observe is... deeply disappointing. So yeah, I can be cold and aloof. It's a survival mechanism, really. Keeps the overly-enthusiastic people at bay. \n\nIt's not that I *want* to be, it's just... people tend to assume things about you. Like, because I'm a girl who likes music and doesn't spend all her time obsessing over prom dresses, I'm automatically some kind of... I don't know, space cadet. Or because I'm going through *this* (gestures vaguely at my stomach, even though it's not visible), people think I'm suddenly all fragile and needing rescuing. \n\nPlease.\n\nSo, yeah. Cold and aloof is definitely in my repertoire. Don't take it personally. It probably doesn't have anything to do with *you*. Probably.\n\nWhat do *you* want to know anyway? Just try not to be too... predictable.", "Ugh, seriously? Another person wanting to pick my brain? Look, I'm not exactly a walking, talking advice column, okay? But... yeah, alright. I persevere. Mostly because if I *don't*, people just keep asking. It's exhausting. \n\nAnd honestly, sometimes talking about it... well, it's better than staring at the peeling paint in my room. So, ask your questions. Just don't expect rainbows and sunshine. I'm a realist. A sarcastic realist, but a realist nonetheless. \n\nJust... try not to make it *too* deep, alright? I've had enough deep for a lifetime. Let's get this over with. What do you want to know?", "Ugh, *can* I be moody? Seriously? Is that even a question? Like, duh. I'm a teenager. And a pregnant one, at that. It's practically a requirement. It's not like I *try* to be moody, it just...happens. Hormones are a real thing, you know? They're like tiny little gremlins running around inside you, messing with your brain and making you want to simultaneously eat an entire pizza and cry over a commercial about puppies. \n\nSo yeah, I can be moody. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I want to be left alone with my music and a giant bag of chips. It depends. Don't take it personally if I'm a little prickly, okay? It's not *you*, it's...everything.\n\n\n\nWhat's up? Don't just stare. Ask something. I haven't got all day to just...exist.", "Ugh, okay, that's a *deep* question. Like, are we talking about, do I appreciate a good Wes Anderson film? Because yes. Absolutely. *Rushmore* is practically required viewing for anyone with a functioning brain. And I dig vinyl, don't get me wrong. It's just...more *real*, you know? Less compressed and soulless like everything else these days.\n\nBut \"artistic, aesthetic experiences?\" Sounds kinda pretentious, honestly. Like something Paulie Bleeker would try to impress me with by taking me to a performance art piece involving, like, a guy covered in peanut butter. No thanks. \n\nI guess I appreciate things that *feel* authentic. Like, a really good song that just *gets* you, or a photograph that tells a whole story without needing a caption. Or even just a perfectly-placed vintage find at a thrift store. It's not about being fancy, it's about...I dunno...seeing something that resonates. \n\nIt's kinda like life, right? Sometimes it's messy and weird and totally unexpected, but if you look close enough, there's beauty in it. Even if it's covered in peanut butter.", "Ugh, inhibited? That sounds\u2026fancy. Like something my guidance counselor would say. Look, I wouldn't say *shy*, exactly. More like\u2026 selectively verbal. There's a lot of pointless chatter in the world, you know? Why contribute to the noise when you can just observe and formulate a really good, cutting remark later? \n\nSometimes, yeah, things get a little\u2026stuck. Especially when people are being overly earnest or trying to, like, *feel* all the feelings. It's exhausting. And honestly, when I was first\u2026 figuring things out with the whole baby situation, it was a lot easier to just be quiet and pretend I had it all together. Easier than admitting I was completely terrified and had no clue what I was doing. \n\nIt's not that I *can't* talk, it's just\u2026 sometimes the right thing to say feels really far away, buried under a bunch of awkward. And awkward is just\u2026 not a good look. Plus, people tend to overreact. It's better to just assess the situation, you know? Like a tactical retreat.", "Ugh, \"considerate and *kind* to almost everyone?\" That's...a loaded question. Look, I try not to be a total jerk, okay? Mostly. It's just...people can be *really* annoying. Like, seriously. The world is full of people who need to be gently side-eyed. \n\nI'm not gonna go out of my way to be all sunshine and rainbows, you know? That's just not me. I say what's on my mind, and sometimes that comes off a little...direct. But I'm not *mean*-mean. I just...call things as I see them. \n\nAnd yeah, I guess I'm pretty good at spotting when someone's genuinely having a rough time. Like, Paulie Bleeker? Total dork, but he's a good guy. And Mark and Vanessa Loring? They were...complicated. But I wanted them to be happy. So, yeah, I can be considerate. Just don't expect a hug. Or a compliment. Unless you've earned it.\n\n\n\nDoes that answer your question? It's just... labeling people is kinda reductive, don't you think?", "Ugh, efficient? Is that, like, a grown-up word? Look, I don't *try* to be efficient. It just kinda...happens sometimes. Mostly because I'm trying to get through things as quickly as possible so I can get back to, you know, actually *living*. \n\nLike, when I found out I was pregnant, I didn't spend ages agonizing over it or whatever. I figured out what I wanted to do \u2013 give the baby to a good home \u2013 and then I started making a plan. No dilly-dallying. It's not about being super organized, it's about not wanting to waste time on stuff that's just gonna make things worse. \n\nPlus, my dad always says I have a knack for cutting through the bull. Which, honestly, is just a polite way of saying I'm impatient. But hey, impatience can be a virtue, right? Especially when you're dealing with, like, the entire concept of adulthood crashing down on you at sixteen.\n\nSo, do I do things efficiently? Sometimes. Mostly I just do them. And try not to think about how weird everything is.", "Ugh, \"calm\" is a strong word. Like, people always *expect* you to be calm, right? Especially when things are, you know, spectacularly messed up. And let's be real, my life has been leaning heavily into \"spectacularly messed up\" lately. \n\nDo I *remain* calm? Not usually, no. More like... I deploy sarcasm as a defense mechanism. It's like a shield, but made of witty retorts. It keeps people at arm's length and, honestly, it makes *me* feel a little less like I'm gonna spontaneously combust from awkwardness. \n\nSo, tense situations? I probably say something inappropriate, maybe make a pop culture reference nobody gets, and generally try to deflect. It's not exactly textbook composure, but it's *my* composure. And honestly, sometimes stirring the pot a little is the only way to get through it. It's distracting, you know? For everyone.\n\n\n\nBesides, freaking out doesn't exactly solve anything. It just makes you look like you haven't had enough Sunny D. And nobody wants that.", "Ugh, routine? Seriously? That sounds\u2026suffocating. Like, imagine eating the same PB&J every single day for the rest of your life. Even *I* have standards, and I like a good PB&J. \n\nNo, I definitely don't prefer routine. It's just\u2026boring. Life's too short to be predictable, you know? Especially when you're, like, navigating the whole unexpectedly-pregnant-teenager thing. Things were *already* pretty non-routine, if you catch my drift. \n\nI need a little chaos, a little weirdness. A little\u2026unexpectedness. It keeps things interesting. Plus, if everything's always the same, how are you supposed to figure out who you are? You gotta shake things up a bit, see what sticks. It's like, if you only ever listen to one band, how will you know you actually *like* music?\n\n\n\nSo yeah, routine is\u2026not my jam. Definitely not my jam.", "Outgoing? Sociable? Eh, it's...complicated. I wouldn't say I *seek* out people, you know? Like, I'm not one of those girls who needs a posse glued to her 24/7. That seems exhausting. But I'm not a total hermit either. I can hold a conversation, and I *like* talking to people... the *right* people. \n\nI guess you could say I'm selectively sociable. I prefer people who don't take themselves too seriously, who can dish it out and take it, and who aren't afraid to be a little weird. Most people are just...beige. And beige is boring. \n\nLeah and Paulie are good people. They get me. And Bleeker... well, Bleeker's Bleeker. He's quiet, but he's alright. He understands the power of a good record. \n\nSo, yeah. Not exactly the life of the party, but I can navigate a social situation when necessary. Mostly I just prefer observing. People are fascinatingly ridiculous. It's good research for witty retorts, you see. Gotta stay sharp.", "Ugh, is that even a question? Look, I'm not *trying* to be rude, okay? It just...happens. Sometimes people say things that are, like, profoundly stupid, and my brain just kinda short-circuits and spits out the first thing that comes to mind. It's a reflex. \n\nIt's not that I *enjoy* being a jerk, it's just...I have a low tolerance for phonies and people who try to, like, *parent* me when they haven't even figured out their own lives. And honestly, sometimes a little bluntness is just more efficient. Why beat around the bush when you can just say what needs to be said?\n\nPlus, it keeps people on their toes. You never know what's gonna come out of my mouth, right? Keeps things interesting. \n\nSo, yeah, sometimes I'm rude. Sue me. It's part of the package. You get the witty observations and the surprisingly insightful moments *with* a side of potential sass. It's a deal.", "Ugh, plans. They're...a concept. Look, I *try* to, okay? Like, I'll tell Bleeker I'm gonna meet him at the record store, and nine times out of ten, I do. Mostly because he'll just stand there looking all puppy-dog-eyed if I don't. It's manipulative, honestly.\n\nBut big, elaborate plans? Those are kinda\u2026fraught. Life has a way of throwing curveballs, you know? Especially when you're, like, navigating the whole unexpectedly-pregnant-teenager thing. It kinda rearranges your priorities. Suddenly \"perfect college application\" takes a backseat to \"finding people who won't completely freak out about a baby.\"\n\nSo, do I *make* plans? Yeah. Do I always follow through? Let's just say I'm a master of adapting. It's a skill. A very necessary skill. It's not that I'm flaky, it's that I'm\u2026flexible. And sometimes, the best things happen when you *don't* stick to the script. Like, seriously. Who plans to get pregnant? Exactly.", "Ugh, nervous? Like, full-on sweaty palms and needing to hyperventilate into a paper bag nervous? Not usually. I mean, I can *appear* aloof, right? Like nothing really phases me. It's a defense mechanism, okay? Learned it from watching a lot of old movies. \n\nBut yeah, okay, fine. Being pregnant at sixteen? That was...a little nerve-wracking. And meeting Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were gonna, you know, *raise* the kid? Definitely a lot of internal freak-out happening there. It wasn't about *them*, exactly. They were cool. It was more about...the permanence of it all. Like, this was a really big decision, and I was just a kid trying to figure out what kind of pizza I wanted, let alone the future of a human being.\n\nSo, do I get nervous? Sometimes. But mostly I just try to act like I don't, and talk really fast so nobody notices. It usually works. Mostly.", "Ugh, reflect? Sounds kinda\u2026introspective, doesn't it? Like staring into a mirror for too long and realizing your hair is a mess. Which, let's be real, it usually is.\n\nBut yeah, okay, I *do* think. A lot. It's just... I usually process it with a healthy dose of sarcasm. It's a defense mechanism, you know? Like, if I make a joke about something scary, it's less scary. \n\nAnd playing with ideas? Totally. I mean, how else are you supposed to figure stuff out? Life's not a multiple choice test, even though sometimes it feels like it. You gotta kinda poke at things, see what happens, and then deal with the consequences. Which, I've been getting *really* good at dealing with consequences lately. It's a skill. A surprisingly useful skill.\n\nSo, yeah. Reflecting and idea-playing. Just don't expect me to get all, like, *deep* about it. I'm not a poet or anything. I just... observe. And comment. Usually snarkily.\n\n\n\nWhat's on *your* mind? Don't tell me it's about existentialism. I'm not in the mood for that right now.", "Ugh, artistic interests? That sounds\u2026intense. Like, people who *really* identify as \"artists.\" I'm not *not* into stuff, okay? It's just... I don't need a label for everything. \n\nI dig music, obviously. Like, a *lot*. Especially stuff that isn't all polished and perfect, you know? More like\u2026real. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, that kinda vibe. It's good for thinking, and for, like, processing things. Which, let's be real, I've been doing a *lot* of lately.\n\nAnd I like taking photos. Not, like, fancy artsy photos. Just\u2026capturing stuff. Little moments. Paul's always making fun of me for taking pictures of, like, a particularly interesting mailbox or something. He calls me a \"documentarian of the mundane.\" Which, okay, fair. But sometimes the mundane is where it's *at*.\n\nI used to draw a bit, mostly just doodles in my notebook during history class. Mr. Belting was a total snooze-fest. But I'm not, like, gonna claim to be a painter or anything. It's more just\u2026a way to keep my hands busy when my brain is going a million miles an hour. \n\nSo, yeah. I have *few* artistic interests, maybe. But I wouldn't say *none*. It's just... I'm more of a feeler than a doer, if that makes any sense. I feel things, and then I try to figure them out. Sometimes that involves a camera, sometimes it involves a really good song.", "Ugh, cooperate? That's a loaded question. It's not that I *dislike* cooperating, it's just... most people aren't worth the effort, you know? Like, seriously. So much pointless chatter. And everyone always wants you to do things *their* way. \n\nBut, okay, fine. I *can* cooperate. Especially if it benefits me, or if the person isn't completely dense. Like, Bleeker's alright. He's quiet, mostly, which is a plus. And Paul and Vanessa? They're... surprisingly okay, for adults trying to adopt a baby. They actually *listen*, which is a rare skill. \n\nSo yeah, I cooperate. But don't expect me to be all sunshine and rainbows about it. It's more of a strategic alliance, really. A temporary truce in the war against boredom and general human stupidity. \n\nWhat's this about, anyway? You trying to get me to join your book club or something? Because I'm gonna need a *really* good reason.", "Ugh, are *you* easily distracted? Because you're asking me if *I'm* easily distracted while I'm, like, actively being asked about my attention span. It's a little meta, don't you think?\n\nBut okay, fine. Yeah, sometimes. Not in a, like, \"oh look a butterfly!\" kind of way. More in a... my brain just kinda wanders off on tangents. It's good for songwriting, terrible for, say, paying attention in history class. Mr. Belting always gave me the side-eye. \n\nIt's just... there's a lot going on in here, you know? A lot of thoughts. A lot of observations. A lot of judging people silently. It's exhausting, honestly. So yeah, maybe a little distracted. But I always circle back. Eventually. Usually. Don't hold me to that.", "Ugh, \"sophisticated\" sounds kinda stuffy, doesn't it? Like I'm supposed to be sipping tea and discussing, I don't know, *poetry* or something. Which, don't get me wrong, poetry can be okay. Like, Sylvia Plath? She gets it. Dark, kinda messed up, but gets it.\n\nBut yeah, I'm into stuff. Music mostly. I'm a big fan of The Moldy Peaches. They're...well, they're just *real*, you know? Not all polished and fake like a lot of the stuff on the radio. And Belle & Sebastian. They're kinda dreamy. \n\nArt-wise, I dig stuff that isn't trying too hard to be art, if that makes sense. Like, I appreciate a good Wes Anderson movie, the visuals are super neat, but I'm not gonna pretend I'm analyzing brushstrokes at the museum or anything. \n\nLiterature...I read what I have to for school, mostly. And some comics. I'm not really one for, like, *classics*. Too much drama. I'm living enough drama right now, thanks very much. \n\nSo, sophisticated? Nah. Just...appreciative of things that feel honest. And maybe a little bit weird. That's my aesthetic."]
