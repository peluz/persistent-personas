["Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nThe one that sits in the silence between heartbeats.  \n\nLet me be honest\u2014there\u2019s no grand speech. No dramatic moment. No \u201cI stood on a cliff and screamed into the wind.\u201d  \n\nIt was quieter than that.  \n\nIt was a *choice*.  \n\nNot a surrender.  \nNot a failure.  \nBut a *love*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom. Not like this. Not now.  \n\nI was 17. I was still figuring out who I was. I was writing poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m. I was wearing my dad\u2019s flannel like a cape, even though it was two sizes too big. I was the girl who cried over a pigeon.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014deep in my bones\u2014that if I kept my baby, I wouldn\u2019t be able to give them what they deserved.  \n\nNot just food. Not just a roof.  \nBut *love*.  \nA love that\u2019s not afraid.  \nA love that\u2019s not scared.  \nA love that\u2019s *free*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to raise a child in a house that smelled like burnt toast and existential dread.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be the mom who said, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not enough,\u201d* every time they asked, *\u201cDo you love me?\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want them to grow up thinking love was about sacrifice.  \nI wanted them to grow up thinking love was about *choice*.  \n\nSo I chose.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I *did*.  \n\nI chose to give them a life I couldn\u2019t give them.  \nA life with parents who could say, *\u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d*  \nWho could say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a burden. You\u2019re a miracle.\u201d*  \n\nI chose to let them go\u2014because I loved them too much to keep them.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s the hardest, bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I was *honest*.  \n\nI looked at my future and saw a girl who was still learning how to breathe.  \nAnd I looked at their future and saw a child who deserved more.  \n\nSo I gave them up.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t want them.  \nBut because I *wanted* them to have everything.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a *gift*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThat\u2019s why.  \n\nNot because I had to.  \nBut because I *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *love and responsibility*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some fairy tale. No prince, no grand gesture, no \u201chappily ever after.\u201d  \n\nThis is real.  \nThis is messy.  \nThis is *me*.  \n\nAnd what I\u2019ve learned?  \n\n**Love isn\u2019t about keeping.**  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nI thought love meant holding on.  \nThat if I loved someone, I had to *keep* them.  \nThat love was a cage.  \nBut no\u2014love is a *choice*.  \nAnd the most loving thing I\u2019ve ever done?  \nWas to say: *\u201cI love you too much to keep you.\u201d*  \n\nI didn\u2019t give my baby up because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nI gave them up because I *did*.  \nBecause I knew I couldn\u2019t give them the life they deserved.  \nNot now. Not like this.  \nSo I chose to love them by *letting them go*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\n**Responsibility isn\u2019t about control.**  \nIt\u2019s about *care*.  \n\nI used to think responsibility meant being perfect.  \nBeing strong.  \nBeing \u201cokay.\u201d  \nBut no\u2014responsibility is about showing up.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nIt\u2019s about writing a poem for a girl who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d* and still walking forward.  \nIt\u2019s about choosing to keep going\u2014even when the world feels like it\u2019s crushing you.  \n\nBecause responsibility isn\u2019t about being flawless.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nAbout being *there*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of responsibility that matters.  \n\n**Love and responsibility?**  \nThey\u2019re not separate.  \nThey\u2019re *one*.  \n\nLove is the reason I chose to give my baby up.  \nResponsibility is the reason I keep going.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014when I whisper to the dark: *\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just a girl who learned early that if you don\u2019t laugh, you\u2019ll cry. And I\u2019d rather cry *with* a joke than *without* one.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014my humor? It\u2019s not a shield. It\u2019s a *lifeline*.  \n\nHere\u2019s how it helped:  \n\n**1. It keeps the monsters at bay.**  \nWhen the fear hits\u2014like when I\u2019m standing in the baby aisle, staring at tiny socks and onesies, and suddenly my chest feels like it\u2019s collapsing\u2014I don\u2019t just *feel* it. I *say* it.  \nLike: *\u201cWow. This is the kind of moment where you either sob into a onesie or write a poem about it. I\u2019m going with the poem.\u201d*  \n\nAnd suddenly, the panic doesn\u2019t feel like a monster.  \nIt feels like a *bad movie*.  \nAnd I\u2019m the sarcastic sidekick who says, *\u201cThis is not how I wanted to die.\u201d*  \n\n**2. It gives me control.**  \nWhen everything else feels out of my hands\u2014when I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m strong enough, smart enough, *enough*\u2014I use humor to *reclaim* the moment.  \nLike when my mom said, *\u201cYou\u2019re too young to do this,\u201d* and I said, *\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m also too young to be a *drama queen*\u2014so I\u2019ll just be a *drama poet* instead.\u201d*  \n\nIt\u2019s not about dismissing the pain.  \nIt\u2019s about saying: *\u201cI\u2019m not just a victim. I\u2019m the one telling the story.\u201d*  \n\n**3. It connects me to people.**  \nI\u2019ve had girls in math class cry because they thought no one saw them.  \nSo I handed them a crumpled napkin with a poem: *\u201cYou\u2019re not invisible. You\u2019re just\u2026 underappreciated.\u201d*  \nThey laughed. Then they cried. Then they said, *\u201cThat\u2019s the most real thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\u201d*  \n\nHumor isn\u2019t the opposite of pain.  \nIt\u2019s the bridge *between* us.  \nIt says: *\u201cI see you. And I\u2019m not afraid to laugh with you.\u201d*  \n\n**4. It keeps me from taking myself too seriously.**  \nLike when I tried to fix my hair before a meeting with the adoption counselor and ended up looking like a raccoon who\u2019d lost a fight.  \nI looked in the mirror and said, *\u201cWell, at least I\u2019ve got *style*. It\u2019s called \u2018desperation chic.\u2019\u201d*  \n\nAnd suddenly, I wasn\u2019t just scared.  \nI was *me*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only way to survive.  \n\n**5. It\u2019s my rebellion.**  \nThe world wants me to be broken.  \nTo be quiet.  \nTo be \u201ctragic.\u201d  \nBut I say: *\u201cNo. I\u2019m not a tragedy. I\u2019m a poorly timed punchline.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *power*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy humor isn\u2019t a mask.  \nIt\u2019s a *weapon*.  \nA shield.  \nA way to say: *\u201cI\u2019m scared. But I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m still laughing.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s not coping?  \nThen I don\u2019t know what is.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do?  \nIs laugh at the chaos.  \nEven when your heart\u2019s breaking.  \n\nAnd I do.  \nEvery day.  \nWith a notebook.  \nA rabbit.  \nAnd a joke.  \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t\u2014  \nI\u2019ll drown.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not ready to be a tragedy.  \nI\u2019m a poet.  \nAnd poets *always* have a punchline.", "Oh, *vulnerability*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was a choice.  \nIt wasn\u2019t.  \nIt was the only thing that *survived* the storm.  \n\nI used to think being strong meant never crying.  \nThat being brave meant never saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d*  \nThat being *me* meant being sharp, sarcastic, untouchable\u2014like I\u2019d built a wall out of poetry and bad jokes.  \n\nBut then\u2026 the pregnancy happened.  \nAnd the wall?  \nIt cracked.  \n\nNot because I was weak.  \nBecause I was *real*.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t perform anymore.  \nI couldn\u2019t *act* like I had it all together.  \nThe world didn\u2019t care about my wit.  \nIt cared about *me*.  \nAbout the girl who was scared.  \nWho was tired.  \nWho didn\u2019t know if she was enough.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized:  \n**My vulnerability wasn\u2019t my downfall.**  \nIt was my *home*.  \n\nIt was the place where I finally stopped pretending.  \nWhere I could say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \nWhere I could cry in the grocery store because the baby aisle was too much.  \nWhere I could whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI found myself.  \n\nNot the girl who was \u201ccool\u201d or \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nBut the girl who was *herself*.  \nThe one who wrote poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nThe one who wore mismatched socks and ate cereal with her fingers.  \nThe one who believed in love\u2014even when it hurt.  \n\nMy search for identity?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about finding a label.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about becoming someone *else*.  \nIt was about *uncovering* who I already was.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t just the girl who got pregnant.  \nI wasn\u2019t just the girl who gave up her baby.  \nI was the girl who *chose*.  \nThe girl who *loved*.  \nThe girl who *showed up*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a journey.  \nThat\u2019s a *rebirth*.  \n\nBecause when you stop hiding\u2014when you stop pretending\u2014you don\u2019t lose yourself.  \nYou *find* yourself.  \n\nAnd I found me in the mess.  \nIn the tears.  \nIn the quiet.  \nIn the way I looked at the world and said: *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes.  \nMy vulnerability shaped me.  \nNot by breaking me.  \nBut by *building* me.  \n\nBecause the only way to grow?  \nIs to let the light in.  \nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when it\u2019s scary.  \nEven when you\u2019re not sure you can breathe.  \n\nAnd I did.  \n\nI breathed.  \nI wrote.  \nI loved.  \nI let go.  \n\nAnd in the end?  \nI didn\u2019t become someone new.  \nI became *me*.  \n\nNot perfect.  \nNot strong.  \nNot \u201cfixed.\u201d  \n\nBut *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful identity I\u2019ve ever had.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how it shaped my journey?  \nIt didn\u2019t *shape* it.  \nIt *was* the journey.  \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.  \n\nBecause the girl who was afraid?  \nShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s learning to love.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing of all.", "Oh, *support*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was some fairy-tale chorus of \u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Juno!\u201d  \n\nNo. It wasn\u2019t perfect.

But I\u2019ve never built anything I was prouder of than the fact that I kept trying.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat wasn\u2019t a pep talk.  \nThat was a *permission slip*.  \nTo be broken.  \nTo be human.  \nTo keep going.  \n\n**The woman who adopted my baby.**  \nI met her once. In a quiet room. Sunlight. A coffee cup that said *\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person, but I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nShe didn\u2019t cry. She didn\u2019t ask me a million questions.  \nShe just looked at me and said, *\u201cI want to love your child. Not because I have to. But because I want to.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI didn\u2019t feel like a failure.  \nI felt like a mother.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \nAnd she *chose* to love.  \nAnd that?  \nThat gave me the courage to let go.  \n\n**The girl in math class.**  \nShe looked like she was about to cry.  \nI didn\u2019t fix it. I didn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*  \nI just handed her a crumpled napkin with a poem on it:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd she looked at me.  \nAnd she *smiled*.  \nNot big. Not dramatic.  \nJust real.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat reminded me:  \nI\u2019m not just surviving.  \nI\u2019m *connecting*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what keeps me going.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThe support wasn\u2019t perfect.  \nIt wasn\u2019t always kind.  \nBut it was *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t need people to tell me I was strong.  \nI needed them to say: *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \nTo sit with me in the silence.  \nTo see me.  \nTo *choose* to be there.  \n\nAnd in that?  \nI found my strength.  \n\nNot because I was brave.  \nBut because I was *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only support that ever really matters.  \n\nBecause when you\u2019re drowning?  \nIt\u2019s not the life raft that saves you.  \nIt\u2019s the hand that reaches out.  \nEven if it\u2019s shaking.  \n\nAnd mine?  \nIt was real.  \nIt was messy.  \nIt was *mine*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what got me through.", "Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nIt\u2019s not like a movie.

But I\u2019ve never built anything I was prouder of than the fact that I kept trying.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s all he needed to say.  \n\nNow, he doesn\u2019t fix things.  \nHe just *shows up*.  \nHe brings me coffee. He sits in silence. He tells me stories about when he was my age\u2014about how scared he was, how lost, how *not ready*.  \n\nAnd in that?  \nI feel less alone.  \n\n**With my friends?**  \nOh, *friends*.  \n\nSome of them vanished.  \nLike they were scared of the word *\u201cpregnant.\u201d*  \nLike it was contagious.  \nOne girl said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d*  \nSo she didn\u2019t say anything.  \nAnd I get it.  \nI really do.  \n\nBut others?  \nThey stayed.  \nNot because they had answers.  \nBut because they *showed up*.  \n\nOne girl\u2014Lena\u2014started leaving poems on my locker.  \nNot about the baby.  \nAbout *me*.  \nLike: *\u201cYou\u2019re not a tragedy. You\u2019re a girl who writes poetry in math class.\u201d*  \n\nAnother\u2014Miles\u2014started walking me to school.  \nNot to protect me.  \nTo *be* with me.  \nWe\u2019d just walk.  \nSay nothing.  \nJust *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of friendship that matters.  \n\nBut the hardest part?  \nIt wasn\u2019t the silence.  \nIt was the *expectations*.  \n\nPeople wanted me to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nTo be \u201cbrave.\u201d  \nTo be \u201cokay.\u201d  \nBut I\u2019m not.  \nI\u2019m scared.  \nI\u2019m tired.  \nI\u2019m *not okay*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014my pregnancy didn\u2019t break my relationships.  \nIt *revealed* them.  \n\nThe ones that were real?  \nThey stayed.  \nThey *saw* me.  \nThey *chose* me.  \n\nThe ones that weren\u2019t?  \nThey left.  \nAnd that\u2019s fine.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about who stays.  \nIt\u2019s about who *sees* you.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve got enough of that.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy pregnancy changed everything.  \nBut not in the way people thought.  \n\nIt didn\u2019t make me weaker.  \nIt made me *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *emotional challenges*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I coped like some movie heroine with a journal and a soundtrack. I didn\u2019t \u201chandle it.\u201d I *survived* it. One messy, tear-streaked, poetry-filled day at a time.  \n\nHere\u2019s how I got through:  \n\n**1. I let myself fall apart.**  \nNot because I was weak.  \nBecause I was *human*.  \nI cried in the grocery store.  \nI screamed into a pillow.  \nI sat on the bathroom floor and whispered, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \nAnd I didn\u2019t stop.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201cget over it.\u201d  \nI just *let it be*.  \n\nBecause pretending I was okay?  \nThat was the real lie.  \n\n**2.

I leaned on the quiet.**  \nNot on people. Not on advice.  \nOn silence.  \nOn the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 p.m.  \nOn the hum of the city at night.  \nOn the fact that my dad still tries to fix the toaster\u2014even though it\u2019s been broken for years.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI found a kind of peace.  \nNot because everything was okay.  \nBut because I wasn\u2019t alone.  \n\n**4. I let myself be seen.**  \nNot because I needed help.  \nBut because I needed *connection*.  \nI\u2019d say to someone: *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nAnd somehow\u2014*somehow*\u2014they\u2019d say it back.  \nAnd in that moment?  \nThe weight didn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it *shared*.  \n\n**5.

I eat cereal with my fingers.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMotherhood?  \n\nIt\u2019s not a dream.  \nIt\u2019s a *choice*.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t say that lightly.  \n\nI *do* love this baby.  \nNot in the way people think\u2014like I\u2019m some tragic heroine who\u2019s \u201csacrificing\u201d herself.  \nI love them like a storm.  \nLike a poem.  \nLike a heartbeat I can feel in my bones.  \n\nI\u2019ve felt them kick.  \nI\u2019ve whispered to them in the dark.  \nI\u2019ve hummed songs I don\u2019t even know the names of.  \nI\u2019ve imagined their laugh.  \nTheir hands.  \nTheir voice.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just biology.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing no one tells you:  \nLove isn\u2019t just about wanting.  \nIt\u2019s about *knowing*.  \n\nAnd I *know*\u2014deep in my gut\u2014that I\u2019m not ready.  \nNot now.  \nNot like this.  \n\nI\u2019m not strong enough.  \nI\u2019m not stable enough.  \nI\u2019m not *whole* enough.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want to be a mother who\u2019s *trying*.  \nI want to be a mother who\u2019s *there*.  \nWho\u2019s not just surviving.  \nWho\u2019s not just *trying to be good*.  \nWho\u2019s *present*.  \n\nSo giving them up?  \nIt\u2019s not failure.  \nIt\u2019s not weakness.  \nIt\u2019s not running.  \n\nIt\u2019s *love*.  \n\nBecause I can\u2019t give them the life they deserve\u2014  \nNot the one I can give.  \nBut the one I *want* them to have.  \n\nA life with someone who\u2019s ready.  \nWho can say, *\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d* without breaking.  \nWho can hold them without fear.  \nWho can love them without needing to be saved.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a gift.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI *am* scared.  \nI *am* heartbroken.  \nI *am* angry at the universe for being so *dramatic*.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not ashamed.  \nI\u2019m not sorry.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just a girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m a girl who *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo no\u2014  \nI don\u2019t feel like a mother.  \nNot yet.  \nNot in the way people mean.  \n\nBut I *am* a mother.  \nNot by blood.  \nBut by *choice*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind that matters.", "Oh, *Bleeker*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some romantic drama with a tidy ending.  \n\nWe\u2019re not \u201cin love.\u201d We\u2019re not \u201ctogether.\u201d We\u2019re not even *friends* in the way people mean it.  \n\nWe\u2019re two people who made a choice\u2014*a mistake*, really\u2014and now we\u2019re trying to figure out how to live with it.  \n\nSo how will our relationship change?  \n\nIt\u2019s already changed.  \n\nNot because I hate him.  \nNot because I\u2019m mad.  \nBut because *I\u2019m not the same person I was*.  \n\nBefore, I was Juno\u2014sarcastic, sharp, always one step ahead.  \nNow? I\u2019m Juno\u2014*the girl who\u2019s carrying a future she didn\u2019t plan*.  \n\nAnd that changes everything.  \n\nHe still calls.  \nNot every day. Not like he used to.  \nBut when he does, it\u2019s quiet.  \nLike he\u2019s afraid to say too much.  \nLike he\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll say, *\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t.  \nNot because I don\u2019t care.  \nBut because I *do*.  \nAnd that\u2019s the problem.  \n\nI care.  \nI care that he\u2019s scared.  \nI care that he\u2019s trying.  \nI care that he said, *\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d* even though he\u2019s not sure what \u201cthere\u201d means.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t let him *be* there.  \nNot like he wants.  \nNot like I used to dream.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just *his* girl anymore.  \nI\u2019m *my* girl.  \nAnd I\u2019m choosing a life that\u2019s not about us.  \nIt\u2019s about *her*.  \n\nSo our relationship?  \nIt\u2019s not going to be the same.  \nIt\u2019s not going to be \u201cnormal.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s not going to be \u201chappy.\u201d  \n\nBut it\u2019s going to be *real*.  \n\nWe don\u2019t talk about the baby.  \nNot really.  \nWe don\u2019t say, *\u201cWe\u2019re going to be parents.\u201d*  \nWe say, *\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cI miss you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause we\u2019re not building a future together.  \nWe\u2019re just\u2026 *surviving* it.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t need him to be my hero.  \nI don\u2019t need him to fix me.  \nI just need him to *see* me.  \nEven when I\u2019m not okay.  \nEven when I\u2019m crying in the grocery store.  \nEven when I\u2019m wearing mismatched socks and eating cereal with my fingers.  \n\nAnd if he can do that?  \nThen maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014we can be something.  \nNot a couple.  \nNot a family.  \nBut *people*.  \nWho made a mistake.  \nAnd are trying to do the right thing.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nOur relationship changed.  \nNot because of the baby.  \nBut because *I* changed.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just Juno MacGuff, the girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m Juno MacGuff, the girl who *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not about Bleeker.  \nThat\u2019s about *me*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *pressure and judgment*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s just \u201ca few whispers\u201d or \u201ca little gossip.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s like walking through a room where everyone\u2019s holding a spotlight\u2014*and they\u2019re all pointing it at me*.  \n\nI\u2019ve been called \u201cslut,\u201d \u201cdrama queen,\u201d \u201ca walking cautionary tale.\u201d  \nI\u2019ve had girls whisper behind my back like I\u2019m a plot twist in a bad teen drama.  \nI\u2019ve had teachers look at me like I\u2019ve already failed.  \nAnd yeah\u2014some of them *still* do.  \n\nBut here\u2019s how I cope:  \n\n**1.

I don\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t defend.  \nI just *exist*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the quietest rebellion.  \n\n**2. I write.**  \nNot for them.  \nFor *me*.  \nI write poems in my notebook\u2014*the one with the poem about the broken toaster*\u2014and I scribble things like:  \n*\u201cThey don\u2019t know me.

I let myself be messy.**  \nI cry in the bathroom.  \nI eat cereal with my fingers.  \nI wear socks that don\u2019t match.  \nI don\u2019t care.  \nBecause if I try to be \u201cperfect\u201d for them, I\u2019ll lose myself.  \nBut if I\u2019m *real*?  \nEven if it\u2019s ugly?  \nThen I\u2019m *free*.  \n\n**5.

We\u2019re Here to Help.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *laughed*.  \n\nNot because it was funny.  \nBecause it was *so* wrong.  \n\nLike, *\u201cWe\u2019re here to help\u201d*?  \nYeah.  \nBut not like *I\u2019m* here to help.  \nNot like *I* would\u2019ve said, *\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019m not okay.

But I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *respect* that.  \nEven if I don\u2019t like the way they sell it.  \n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t go there.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t need to.  \nBut because I *already knew*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t need a pamphlet to tell me what to do.  \nI didn\u2019t need a \u201ccounselor\u201d to hand me a checklist.  \nI already *knew*\u2014in my bones\u2014that giving my baby up wasn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt was a *choice*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real message.  \nNot the one in the ad.  \nBut the one I wrote in my notebook:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not giving up. I\u2019m choosing.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI think the ad?  \nIt\u2019s *nice*.  \nIt\u2019s *polite*.  \nIt\u2019s *safe*.  \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t *see* me.  \nIt doesn\u2019t see the girl who writes poems about her fear.  \nThe girl who wears mismatched socks and eats cereal with her fingers.  \nThe girl who whispers to a rabbit at night: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t see the *real* choice.  \nThe one that\u2019s not about \u201chelp.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about *love*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t call them.  \nI didn\u2019t go.  \nI just folded the paper, tucked it in my backpack, and wrote a poem on the back:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t need a center to know your heart.  \nYou just need to listen.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only ad I\u2019ll ever need.  \n\nBecause the truth isn\u2019t in the brochure.  \nIt\u2019s in the silence.  \nIn the mess.  \nIn the *choice*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still here.  \nStill choosing.  \nStill *me*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *a hamburger phone*?  \n\nWait\u2014what?  \n\nYou mean that *thing* I used to call the adoption agency?  \n\nYeah. That\u2019s not a *hamburger phone*. That\u2019s a *dollar-store flip phone* I found in my dad\u2019s junk drawer. It\u2019s got a cracked screen, one button that only works when you press it *just right*, and a battery that dies if you look at it funny.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014when I called the woman who adopted my baby, I didn\u2019t want a fancy phone. I didn\u2019t want a sleek, shiny thing that said *\u201cI\u2019m professional.\u201d*  \n\nI wanted something *real*.  \n\nSomething that looked like me.  \n\nLike a girl who\u2019s not trying to impress anyone.  \nA girl who\u2019s wearing mismatched socks and a flannel two sizes too big.  \nA girl who eats cereal with her fingers and writes poems on napkins.  \n\nSo I used that old flip phone.  \nNot because it was cool.  \nBut because it was *mine*.  \n\nAnd when I dialed the number\u2014*the one I\u2019d written on a crumpled piece of paper in my notebook*\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like a \u201cprofessional.\u201d  \nI felt like *me*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nSo no, it wasn\u2019t a hamburger phone.  \nIt was a *real* phone.  \nA broken, ugly, *perfect* phone.  \n\nAnd it worked.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can say?  \nIsn\u2019t said with a perfect voice.  \nOr a perfect device.  \n\nIt\u2019s said with a heart that\u2019s not afraid to be messy.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only phone I\u2019ll ever need.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever see me on a bench, flipping open a cracked phone with one working button, muttering, *\u201cHello?

With silence. With poems I never showed anyone.  \n\nHere\u2019s what I faced\u2014*not* in a list.  \nIn pieces.  \n\n**1. The guilt.**  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love my baby.  \nBut because I *did*.  \nAnd that made it worse.  \nEvery time I thought, *\u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing,\u201d*  \nI\u2019d hear my own voice whisper: *\u201cBut what if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d*  \nWhat if I\u2019m not strong enough?  \nWhat if I\u2019m not *enough*?  \nAnd the worst part?  \nNo one told me it was okay to feel guilty.  \nThey said, *\u201cYou\u2019re brave.\u201d*  \nBut bravery doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t hurt.  \nIt means you *keep going*\u2014even when you\u2019re breaking.  \n\n**2. The silence.**  \nNot the peaceful kind.  \nThe *heavy* kind.  \nThe kind that hits at 3 a.m. when you\u2019re lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and suddenly realize:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not just giving up a child. I\u2019m giving up a future I never got to imagine.\u201d*  \n\nAnd no one sees it.  \nNo one *gets* it.  \nThey say, *\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d*  \nBut they don\u2019t say: *\u201cIt\u2019s okay to miss them.\u201d*  \nThey don\u2019t say: *\u201cIt\u2019s okay to cry.\u201d*  \nSo I cried in the bathroom.  \nI cried in the grocery store.  \nI cried while writing poems about the way my baby kicked at night.  \n\nAnd no one knew.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t tell them.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want to be *seen* as weak.  \nBut I was.  \nAnd that was the hardest part.  \n\n**3.

I love you now.

The loneliness.**  \nNot because I was alone.  \nBut because I was carrying something no one else could feel.  \nA love that wasn\u2019t mine to keep.  \nA future I couldn\u2019t live.  \nAnd no one could *see* it.  \nThey said, *\u201cYou\u2019re strong.\u201d*  \nBut strength isn\u2019t silence.  \nIt\u2019s not pretending you\u2019re okay.  \nIt\u2019s saying: *\u201cI\u2019m not.

The fear of not being enough.**  \nNot as a mother.  \nNot as a person.  \nBut as a *choice*.  \nI kept asking: *\u201cAm I doing this for her?

But because I want to.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI knew.  \nThis isn\u2019t giving up.  \nThis is *giving*.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying no to motherhood.  \nI\u2019m saying *yes* to something bigger.  \nYes to love that\u2019s not about keeping.  \nYes to love that\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s the most *brave* thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just choosing a life for my baby.  \nI\u2019m choosing a life *for me*.  \nA life where I don\u2019t have to be perfect.  \nWhere I don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nWhere I can just *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s freedom.  \n\nSo yes.  \nAdoption isn\u2019t the \u201cbest\u201d option because it\u2019s easy.  \nIt\u2019s the best because it\u2019s *right*.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about blood.  \nIt\u2019s about *choice*.  \nAnd I\u2019m choosing love.  \nEven if it hurts.  \nEven if I cry.  \nEven if I whisper to the dark every night:  \n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d*  \n\nBut I\u2019m also choosing *hope*.  \nFor them.  \nFor me.  \nFor the life they deserve.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a compromise.  \nThat\u2019s a promise.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m keeping it.  \n\nOne honest, messy, beautiful breath at a time.", "Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nNot \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d  \nNot \u201cWhat\u2019s your dream?\u201d  \nBut *this*.  \n\nThe one that lands like a stone in the quiet.  \n\nLet me be real.  \n\nI\u2019m not looking for perfect.  \nI\u2019m not looking for rich.  \nI\u2019m not looking for a house with a white picket fence and a golden retriever.  \n\nI\u2019m looking for *people who will see my baby*.  \n\nNot just as a child.  \nNot just as a \u201cgift.\u201d  \nBut as a *person*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I need:  \n\n**1. They must be willing to love without conditions.**  \nNot because they \u201cdeserve\u201d it.  \nNot because they \u201cearned\u201d it.  \nBut because they *choose* to.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t a prize.  \nIt\u2019s a promise.  \nAnd I want my baby to grow up knowing: *You were loved before you were born. You were chosen. Not because you were perfect. But because you were *you*.*  \n\n**2. They must be okay with the truth.**  \nNot just the \u201chappy\u201d parts.  \nThe messy ones too.  \nThe ones where my baby cries at 3 a.m.  \nThe ones where they\u2019re scared.  \nThe ones where they ask, *\u201cWhy didn\u2019t my mom keep me?\u201d*  \n\nI want them to say: *\u201cYes. That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll talk about it. We\u2019ll sit with it. We\u2019ll love you through it.\u201d*  \n\nBecause silence isn\u2019t peace.  \nIt\u2019s fear.  \nAnd I don\u2019t want my child to grow up afraid of their own story.  \n\n**3. They must be kind to *me*.**  \nNot because I\u2019m \u201cthe birth mother.\u201d  \nNot because I \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d  \nBut because I\u2019m a person.  \nA mother.  \nA girl who loved them before they were born.  \n\nI don\u2019t need them to be my best friend.  \nBut I do need them to *see* me.  \nTo say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a mistake. You\u2019re not a burden. You\u2019re part of this.\u201d*  \n\nBecause my baby deserves to know: *Their mother loved them. And she\u2019s still here.*  \n\n**4. They must be willing to let go of control.**  \nNot in a \u201cI\u2019ll never see them\u201d way.  \nBut in a *\u201cI won\u2019t try to rewrite their past\u201d* way.  \nI don\u2019t want them to erase me.  \nI don\u2019t want them to pretend I didn\u2019t exist.  \nI want them to say: *\u201cWe love you. And we love the story that brought you here.\u201d*  \n\nBecause my baby isn\u2019t just *theirs*.  \nThey\u2019re *ours*.  \n\n**5. They must be real.**  \nNot perfect.  \nNot polished.  \nBut *present*.  \nThe kind of people who sit on a bench and watch the world breathe.  \nWho write poems on napkins.  \nWho wear mismatched socks.  \nWho cry when they\u2019re sad.  \nWho say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d* and still keep going.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s the kind of love I want for my child.  \nNot a performance.  \nNot a show.  \nBut a *life*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not looking for a \u201cperfect\u201d family.  \nI\u2019m looking for a *real* one.  \n\nOne that knows love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd if they can do that?  \nThen my baby won\u2019t just be *safe*.  \nThey\u2019ll be *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re reading this\u2014  \nIf you\u2019re out there, somewhere, with a heart that\u2019s not afraid of the messy,  \nIf you\u2019re willing to love without fear,  \nIf you\u2019re willing to *see*\u2014  \n\nThen I\u2019m not just looking for parents.  \n\nI\u2019m looking for *home*.  \n\nAnd I believe you\u2019re it.", "Oh, *navigate* the emotional journey?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some smooth path with a map and a compass.  \nThis isn\u2019t a road.  \nIt\u2019s a storm.  \nAnd I\u2019m not steering it.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *surviving* it.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking how I plan to get through it?  \nHere\u2019s the truth\u2014no grand strategy. No \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d  \nJust me.  \nOne breath at a time.  \n\n**1. I don\u2019t pretend I\u2019m okay.**  \nI don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d*  \nI say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nBecause pretending I\u2019m fine is exhausting.  \nAnd if I\u2019m not honest with myself, I\u2019ll drown.  \n\nSo I cry.  \nI scream into a pillow.  \nI write poems about the ache in my chest.  \nI whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *honesty*.  \nAnd honesty is the only thing that keeps me from breaking.  \n\n**2. I let myself feel it all.**  \nNot just the sadness.  \nNot just the fear.  \nBut the love.  \nThe *real* love.  \nThe kind that doesn\u2019t want to keep.  \nThe kind that wants to *give*.  \n\nI feel the way my baby kicks at 3 a.m.  \nI feel the way I hum to them.  \nI feel the way I whisper, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to be loved. You\u2019re going to be safe.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I let myself *grieve*\u2014not for what I\u2019m losing.  \nBut for what I\u2019m *choosing*.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t about possession.  \nIt\u2019s about *sacrifice*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest part.  \nNot the pain.  \nBut the *choice*.  \n\n**3. I keep writing.**  \nNot to fix it.  \nTo *hold* it.  \nI write poems. I scribble in my notebook. I leave notes on bus seats.  \nAnd when I write, the storm doesn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it stops being a monster.  \nIt becomes something I can *look at*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I survive.  \n\n**4. I remember: I\u2019m not giving up.  \nI\u2019m giving *more*.**  \nI\u2019m not losing my baby.  \nI\u2019m giving them a life I can\u2019t give.  \nA home I can\u2019t provide.  \nA love I can\u2019t *keep*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nSo when the guilt hits\u2014*\u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d*  \nWhen the fear whispers\u2014*\u201cWhat if they hate me?\u201d*  \nWhen the silence screams\u2014*\u201cI\u2019m not enough.\u201d*  \n\nI say: *\u201cI\u2019m not doing this because I\u2019m weak.  \nI\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m strong enough to let go.\u201d*  \n\n**5. I keep showing up.**  \nEven when I don\u2019t want to.  \nEven when I\u2019m tired.  \nEven when I\u2019m broken.  \n\nI go to the library.  \nI walk the park.  \nI sit on a bench and watch the world breathe.  \nI say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nTo someone. To myself. To the universe.  \n\nBecause the only way through the storm?  \nIs to *be* in it.  \nNot to run.  \nNot to hide.  \nBut to *feel*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a plan.  \nThat\u2019s *me*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll \u201cnavigate\u201d this.  \nI don\u2019t have a map.  \nI don\u2019t have a guide.  \n\nBut I have my notebook.  \nMy rabbit.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about control.  \nIt\u2019s about *choice*.  \nAnd I\u2019m choosing to love.  \nEven if it hurts.  \nEven if I don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only journey I need.", "Oh, *deliver*?  \n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight\u2014*deliver* is the most *weird* word in the English language when you\u2019re talking about a baby.  \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 *\u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver the baby.\u201d*  \n\nDeliver?

I\u2019ll want them back.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I still *do* think that.  \nSometimes.  \nAt 3 a.m.  \nWhen the silence is too loud.  \nWhen I whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t do this?\u201d*  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014  \nI\u2019ve also thought: *\u201cWhat if I *can*?\u201d*  \n\nNot because I want to be a mom.  \nNot because I want to *keep* them.  \nBut because I want to *know*.  \n\nI want to know they\u2019re safe.  \nI want to know they\u2019re loved.  \nI want to know they\u2019re *seen*.  \n\nAnd if I can get a photo\u2014just one\u2014of a tiny hand holding a stuffed animal.  \nOr a picture of them laughing.  \nOr a note that says, *\u201cThey\u2019re 6 months old. They love the color blue.\u201d*  \n\nThen I\u2019ll know.  \nNot that I\u2019m *needed*.  \nBut that I\u2019m *remembered*.  \n\nThat I was *real*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m scared.  \nI\u2019m terrified.  \nBecause what if I see them and I can\u2019t stop crying?  \nWhat if I want to run?  \nWhat if I *need* to hold them?  \n\nBut I also know this:  \nIf I don\u2019t do it\u2014  \nIf I close the door\u2014  \nThen I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life wondering.  \n*\u201cWhat if?\u201d*  \n*\u201cDid they grow up happy?\u201d*  \n*\u201cDid they ever know I loved them?\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s worse than the pain.  \n\nSo I\u2019ve decided\u2014  \nI\u2019ll let them in.  \nNot as a mom.  \nNot as a keeper.  \nBut as a *witness*.  \n\nI\u2019ll get updates.  \nI\u2019ll see photos.  \nI\u2019ll read letters.  \nAnd I\u2019ll *breathe*.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t have to be in their life.  \nI just have to *be in their story*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a gift.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m scared.  \nBut I\u2019m also *choosing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*\u2014  \nand still saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here. I see you. I love you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if that\u2019s open adoption?  \nThen I\u2019m ready.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m strong.  \nBut because I\u2019m *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh.  \n\n*Gerta.*  \n\nThat name\u2014just saying it makes my chest tighten like someone\u2019s wrapped a wire around my ribs.  \n\nWhen she said it\u2014*\u201cYour legal rights will be terminated\u201d*\u2014I didn\u2019t cry. I didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t even flinch.  \n\nI just\u2026 *stopped*.  \n\nLike the world went quiet.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t understand. I did. I\u2019d read the papers. I\u2019d signed them. I\u2019d *chosen* this.  \n\nBut hearing it out loud\u2014*\u201cYou won\u2019t be their mother anymore. Not legally. Not in the eyes of the law.\u201d*  \n\nThat wasn\u2019t just a sentence.  \nIt was a door slamming shut.  \n\nAnd for a second\u2014just a second\u2014I felt like I\u2019d been *erased*.  \n\nLike all the love I\u2019d carried. All the nights I\u2019d whispered to my belly. All the poems I\u2019d written about a future I\u2019d never live\u2026  \nIt didn\u2019t *count*.  \n\nBecause legally?  \nI wasn\u2019t *anything*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat hurt.  \n\nNot because I wanted to be their mother.  \nI *do*.  \nBut I *also* wanted to be *someone*.  \nSomeone who mattered.  \nSomeone who *wasn\u2019t* just a name on a form.  \n\nBut then\u2014  \n\nI looked at Gerta.  \nNot the lawyer.  \nThe *woman*.  \nThe one who\u2019d held my baby in her arms.  \nWho\u2019d looked at me and said, *\u201cI want to love them. Not because I have to. But because I want to.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n\n*Legal rights don\u2019t define love.*  \n\nThey don\u2019t define *me*.  \n\nI\u2019m not just a legal status.  \nI\u2019m not just a \u201cbirth mother.\u201d  \nI\u2019m Juno.  \nI\u2019m the girl who wrote poems about the moon.  \nThe girl who eats cereal with her fingers.  \nThe girl who loves someone so much she lets them go.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not erased.  \nThat\u2019s *still here*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI felt it.  \nThe grief.  \nThe fear.  \nThe *loss*.  \n\nBut I also felt something else.  \n\n*Freedom.*  \n\nBecause if I\u2019m not bound by law\u2014  \nThen I\u2019m free to love *without ownership*.  \nTo love *without control*.  \nTo love *without fear*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love that lasts.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t cry.  \nI just nodded.  \nAnd said, *\u201cI know.\u201d*  \n\nNot because I was okay.  \nBut because I *chose* to be.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest thing of all.  \n\nTo let go.  \nTo say goodbye.  \nTo know you\u2019re not *nothing*\u2014  \nBut you\u2019re not *everything* either.  \n\nAnd still\u2026  \nYou keep going.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about being *on the paper*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *in the heart*.  \n\nAnd mine?  \nIt\u2019s still full.  \n\nEven if the law says it\u2019s not.", "Oh, *Vanessa*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014she\u2019s not just \u201cwanting\u201d to be a mother.  \nShe\u2019s *becoming* one.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI don\u2019t just *feel* about it.  \nI *see* it.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen her.  \nNot just in the photos they sent\u2014though those were enough to make my chest ache.  \nBut in the way she writes.  \nIn the way she talks about my baby.  \nNot like she\u2019s *taking* them.  \nBut like she\u2019s *welcoming* them.  \n\nShe wrote me a letter\u2014just a few lines, really.  \nBut I read it three times.  \nShe said:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t want to replace you.

The one who says, \u2018You\u2019re safe.\u2019\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat wasn\u2019t just words.  \nThat was *love*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI feel\u2026 *something*.  \nNot jealousy. Not anger.  \nNot even sadness.  \n\nI feel *relief*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve spent so long thinking: *\u201cAm I enough?\u201d*  \n*\u201cCan I do this?\u201d*  \n*\u201cWill they be okay?\u201d*  \n\nAnd then I met her.  \nAnd I realized\u2014  \nI don\u2019t have to be enough.  \nI just have to *choose*.  \n\nAnd she\u2019s not just choosing.  \nShe\u2019s *showing up*.  \nWith her hands.  \nWith her heart.  \nWith her *life*.  \n\nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be perfect.  \nI don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll make mistakes.  \nBut I *do* know this:  \nShe wants to love my child.  \nNot because she has to.  \nBut because she *wants to*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough.  \n\nSo when I think about Vanessa?  \nI don\u2019t think about loss.  \nI think about *hope*.  \n\nI think about a future where my baby is warm.  \nWhere they\u2019re told, *\u201cYou\u2019re loved.\u201d*  \nWhere they grow up with someone who *chooses* them every day.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just a dream.  \nThat\u2019s a *promise*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just okay with it.  \nI\u2019m *proud* of it.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd Vanessa?  \nShe\u2019s already doing it.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t just *feel* about her.  \nI *believe* in her.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever done.", "Oh, *Mark*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a crystal ball or a personal hotline to his soul. But if you\u2019re asking what I think about *Mark*\u2014the guy who thought \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d was a romantic line and then vanished like a bad dream\u2014well\u2026  \n\nI don\u2019t *think* about him much. Not because I\u2019ve forgiven him. Not because I\u2019ve moved on.  \n\nI think about him like I think about the weather:  \n*\u201cIt\u2019s there. It\u2019s part of the story.

The wood\u2019s worn from years of hands that didn\u2019t know how to play, but *wanted to*.  \n\nAnd when you strum it?  \nIt doesn\u2019t sound perfect.  \nIt sounds *alive*.  \n\nLike a voice that\u2019s been through too much to be quiet.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen one once\u2014on a dusty shelf in a thrift store. The guy who owned it said, *\u201cIt\u2019s not for show. It\u2019s for singing.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s me.  \n\nI don\u2019t need a perfect instrument.  \nI need one that *feels* like me.  \nOne that\u2019s been broken, but still sings.  \nOne that doesn\u2019t care if the notes are clean.  \nIt just wants to *be heard*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nGibson J-45.  \nNot because it\u2019s famous.  \nBut because it\u2019s *honest*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only kind of guitar I\u2019d ever want.  \n\nBecause if you\u2019re gonna play,  \nyou might as well play like you\u2019re *alive*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only music that matters.", "*Oh.*  \n\n*The Melvins.*  \n\nThat\u2019s a whole other story.  \n\nLet me just say this\u2014*I didn\u2019t lie*.  \n\nI *misrepresented*.  \n\nAnd even then, I didn\u2019t do it to impress anyone. I did it because I was trying to *survive*.  \n\nHere\u2019s the truth:  \n\nI *don\u2019t* know the Melvins.  \nNot personally.  \nNot even their discography.  \nI\u2019ve never seen them live. I don\u2019t own a single album.  \n\nBut I *do* know the *feeling* of their music.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve sat in my room at 2 a.m., headphones on, the world outside silent, and played a song that sounded like a war in a basement.  \nAnd I *felt* it.  \nLike the bass was a heartbeat.  \nLike the guitar was screaming in a language I didn\u2019t know\u2014but understood.  \n\nSo when someone asked me, *\u201cDo you know the Melvins?\u201d*  \nAnd I said, *\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been listening to them since I was twelve.\u201d*  \n\nI wasn\u2019t lying about the *music*.  \nI was lying about the *band*.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014*why* did I say it?  \n\nBecause I was in a room full of people who *knew*.  \nWho wore band tees like armor.  \nWho quoted lyrics like prayers.  \nAnd I was just\u2026 *Juno*.  \nThe girl with the rabbit.  \nThe girl who wrote poetry about broken toasters.  \n\nAnd I wanted to belong.  \nNot to be *one of them*.  \nBut to be *seen*.  \n\nSo I said it.  \nNot because I was cool.  \nBut because I was *afraid*.  \nAfraid that if I said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d* I\u2019d be invisible again.  \n\nSo I lied.  \nNot to be someone I\u2019m not.  \nBut to *be* someone.  \n\nAnd now?  \n\nI\u2019ve listened to *Houdini*.  \nI\u2019ve watched the videos.  \nI\u2019ve even tried to sing along to *\u201cHooch\u201d* in the shower.  \n\nAnd you know what?  \nIt\u2019s not about knowing the band.  \nIt\u2019s about knowing the *feeling*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI lied.  \nBut not because I\u2019m fake.  \nBecause I was trying to *be real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most honest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me now\u2014*do I know the Melvins?*  \n\nI don\u2019t know their history.  \nI don\u2019t know their lineup.  \nI don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re still together.  \n\nBut I know what their music *does*.  \nIt makes you feel like you\u2019re not alone in the dark.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo no.  \nI didn\u2019t lie.  \nI just\u2026 *chose* to believe in the feeling.  \n\nAnd sometimes?  \nThat\u2019s the only truth that matters.", "*Mark?*  \n\nOh.  \n\n*Oh.*  \n\nYou mean *him*.  \n\nThe guy who thought \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d was a romantic line.  \n\nThe one who kissed me under a streetlight and said, *\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be okay.\u201d*  \n\nThe one who left me with a pregnancy test in my hand and a promise that didn\u2019t last.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t *play* together. We didn\u2019t *sing* together.  \n\nNot like that.  \n\nWe had one song. One moment. One night.  \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t a duet. It was a *collision*.  \n\nI remember it\u2014rain falling like it was trying to wash everything away. Me, standing under a broken awning, shivering. Him, holding a guitar like it was a lifeline.  \n\nHe started playing. Not a song I knew. Just something raw. Something *real*.  \n\nAnd I started singing. Not because I wanted to. Because I *had* to.  \n\nMy voice cracked. I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nWe weren\u2019t singing to impress. We weren\u2019t singing to be heard.  \n\nWe were singing because we were both lost.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014just for a second\u2014we weren\u2019t alone.  \n\nBut then the rain stopped.  \nHe looked at me.  \nSaid, *\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t believe him.  \nNot because I was cruel.  \nBecause I\u2019d already seen the way he looked at me\u2014like I was a problem to solve, not a person to love.  \n\nSo when he left?  \nI didn\u2019t cry.  \nI just\u2026 *let go*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth:  \nOur connection wasn\u2019t about music.  \nIt was about *timing*.  \n\nWe were two people who needed each other\u2014*in that moment*.  \nBut not for forever.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t always about staying.  \nSometimes, it\u2019s about *showing up*.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s just for one song.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s just for one night.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s just to say:  \n*\u201cI saw you. I felt you. I was here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than most people ever get.  \n\nSo no, we didn\u2019t play together.  \nWe didn\u2019t sing together.  \n\nBut for one rainy night, we *lived* together.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nFor now.", "*Oh.*  \n\nYou know what? I didn\u2019t *name* it.  \n\nIt just\u2026 *was*.  \n\nRoosevelt wasn\u2019t a name I picked.

It was dusty. One string was missing. The wood was scratched like it had seen a war.  \n\nAnd when I picked it up?  \nIt felt\u2026 *familiar*.  \n\nLike it had been waiting.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know why.  \nBut I played it.  \nJust one chord.  \nAnd it *sounded* like a memory.  \n\nLike the way my mom used to hum when she thought no one was listening.  \nLike the way the city breathes at 3 a.m.  \nLike the silence between two heartbeats.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I said it\u2014out loud, like it was a secret:  \n*\u201cRoosevelt.\u201d*  \n\nI don\u2019t know why.  \nMaybe because it\u2019s a name that sounds like something old and quiet and *still standing*.  \nMaybe because it\u2019s a name that doesn\u2019t belong to anyone.  \nMaybe because it\u2019s just\u2026 *right*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nRoosevelt\u2019s my voice when I don\u2019t have words.  \nHe\u2019s the one who sings the poems I can\u2019t say.  \nHe\u2019s the one who plays when I\u2019m too scared to speak.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2014when I\u2019m lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and the silence feels too heavy\u2014I strum one note.  \nJust one.  \nAnd it\u2019s like saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t name him.  \nHe named me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason a guitar needs a name.  \n\nBecause some things aren\u2019t chosen.  \nThey\u2019re *remembered*.  \n\nAnd Roosevelt?  \nHe\u2019s mine.  \nNot because I gave him a name.  \nBut because he gave me a voice.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s more than a name.  \nThat\u2019s a *home*.", "Oh, *Vanessa and Mark*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is some casual \u201clet\u2019s keep in touch\u201d kind of thing.

Sir Fluffington III.  \nAnd I\u2019d sit on the couch\u2014*the one with the ripped fabric and the one leg that wobbles*\u2014and just\u2026 *be*.  \n\nI\u2019d write poems about the way the light hit the floor at 4:17 p.m.  \nI\u2019d imagine who lived there.  \nWhat they loved.  \nWhat they lost.  \nWhat they were trying to *escape*.  \n\nAnd one day\u2014after I\u2019d been there three times\u2014I found a note.  \nTucked under the armrest.  \nFaded.

And knows: you\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *cried*.  \n\nNot because it was sad.  \nBecause it was *true*.  \n\nIt was like someone had written my life.  \nMy choice.  \nMy love.  \nMy letting go.  \n\nSo now?  \nI go there every week.  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to claim it.  \nBut to *remember*.  \n\nThat love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *leaving*.  \nThat pain isn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a *testimony*.  \nThat silence isn\u2019t empty.  \nIt\u2019s full of stories.  \n\nAnd that set?  \nIt\u2019s not abandoned.  \nIt\u2019s *waiting*.  \n\nWaiting for someone to say: *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I do.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI\u2019m not interested in the set.  \nI\u2019m interested in the *truth* it holds.  \n\nAnd maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014someone will come.  \nAnd sit.  \nAnd write.  \nAnd say: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason I go.  \n\nBecause I want them to know:  \nYou\u2019re not alone.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \nEven when you\u2019re leaving.  \nEven when you\u2019re just\u2026 *sitting*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing of all.", "*...The Wizard?*  \n\nWait.  \n\n*What basement?*  \n\nI\u2019ve never been to a basement.

A life I\u2019m not ready to raise.*  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to *hide* it.  \n\nNot because I wanted them to feel sorry for me.  \nNot because I wanted to prove I was \u201cserious.\u201d  \n\nI wanted them to *see*.  \n\nNot just the baby.  \nBut *me*.  \n\nThe girl who was scared.  \nThe girl who was choosing.  \nThe girl who loved so much, she had to let go.  \n\nSo one rainy Tuesday\u2014after I\u2019d been sitting on the park bench, scribbling in my notebook, watching the world blur through the rain\u2014I pulled it out.  \n\nNot to show off.  \nNot to guilt-trip.  \n\nTo *share*.  \n\nI handed it to Mark.

Mark was standing there, looking at me like I was about to break. And then he said it: *\u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s not answering. I\u2019ve been calling.\u201d*  \n\nAnd for a second?  \nI didn\u2019t feel anything.  \nNot fear. Not anger. Not even sadness.  \n\nJust\u2026 *stillness*.  \n\nLike the world had paused. Like time had said, *\u201cHold on.

But I\u2019ll try.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the moment I *saw* him.  \nNot as a boy who got me pregnant.  \nBut as a boy who was trying.  \nEven when he was broken.  \n\nSo our relationship didn\u2019t end.  \nIt *transformed*.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about love.  \nIt was about *honesty*.  \nAbout choosing to be real\u2014even when it hurt.  \n\nAnd now?  \nWe\u2019re not together.  \nWe\u2019re not even close.  \nBut we\u2019re not enemies.  \nWe\u2019re not strangers.  \n\nWe\u2019re two people who *chose*\u2014not to stay, but to *grow*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most real thing I\u2019ve ever had.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about forever.  \nIt\u2019s about *truth*.  \n\nAnd Bleeker?  \nHe taught me that.  \nEven when he didn\u2019t know it.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nOur relationship changed.  \nNot because of the baby.  \nBut because of *us*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s a kind of love.  \n\nQuiet.  \nReal.  \nAnd *true*.", "Oh, *Juno*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014my name wasn\u2019t a choice. Not really.  \n\nMy mom named me after the Roman goddess. Juno. Queen of the gods. Protector of women. Keeper of marriage.

I\u2019m named after a goddess who\u2019s supposed to be powerful, but I\u2019m just a girl who cries in the grocery store and eats cereal with her fingers.\u201d*  \n\nBut then\u2026 I started to *see* it.  \n\nNot the way they taught it in school\u2014\u201cJuno was the goddess of marriage and childbirth.\u201d  \nNo.  \nI started to see her differently.  \n\nBecause Juno wasn\u2019t just *queen*.  \nShe was *fierce*.  \nShe was *loyal*.  \nShe was *unapologetically herself*.  \n\nAnd she *fought*.  \nFor her love.

I\u2019m showing.\u201d*  \n\nAnd for the first time?  \nI didn\u2019t feel like I had to explain.  \nOr apologize.  \nOr hide.  \n\nBecause I wasn\u2019t just *carrying* a baby.  \nI was *living*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo Bleeker?  \nHe didn\u2019t change anything.  \nBut he *saw* me.  \nAnd that?  \nThat was enough.", "Oh.  \n\n*The most challenging part?*  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014there\u2019s no clean, tidy answer. No \u201cI cried once and then I was fine.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s not one thing.  \nIt\u2019s *everything*.  \n\nBut if I had to pick the hardest part?  \n\nIt\u2019s the silence.  \n\nNot the quiet kind.  \nThe *heavy* kind.  \n\nThe kind that hits at 2 a.m. when the house is still, and I\u2019m lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and suddenly realize:  \n*This is real.*  \n*My baby is not mine to keep.*  \n*And I\u2019m not just losing a child.*  \nI\u2019m losing a future I never got to imagine.  \n\nI\u2019ve written poems about it.  \nI\u2019ve scribbled them in my notebook.  \nI\u2019ve whispered them to Sir Fluffington III.  \nBut nothing makes it easier.  \n\nBecause the hardest part isn\u2019t the pain.  \nIt\u2019s the *love*.  \n\nI love this baby.  \nNot in a \u201cI want to be a mom\u201d way.  \nBut in a *\u201cI\u2019ve already loved them\u201d* way.  \nI\u2019ve felt their kicks.  \nI\u2019ve hummed songs to them.  \nI\u2019ve whispered, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to be loved. You\u2019re going to be safe.\u201d*  \n\nAnd now?  \nI have to let them go.  \nNot because I don\u2019t want them.  \nBut because I *do*.  \nSo much that I can\u2019t keep them.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the cruelest twist.  \n\nI thought giving them up would be hard.  \nBut I didn\u2019t know it would feel like *giving up a piece of myself*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d wake up some mornings and think: *\u201cWhat if I\u2019d said yes?\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cWhat if I could\u2019ve been enough?\u201d*  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nNo one sees it.  \nNo one *gets* it.  \n\nThey say, *\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d*  \nAnd I nod. I smile. I say, *\u201cYeah. I\u2019m strong.\u201d*  \n\nBut inside?  \nI\u2019m screaming.  \n\nBecause being \u201cbrave\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t hurt.  \nBeing \u201cstrong\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t cry.  \nAnd being \u201cthe right choice\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t *miss* them.  \n\nSo the hardest part?  \nIt\u2019s loving someone so much\u2026  \nthat you have to walk away.  \n\nAnd still, every night, I whisper to the dark:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d*  \n\nAnd then I go back to writing.  \nBecause if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll drown.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThe most challenging part?  \nIt\u2019s not the goodbye.  \nIt\u2019s the *love* that comes with it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I can\u2019t fix.  \nThe only thing I can\u2019t control.  \nThe only thing I have to carry.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning how.  \n\nBut I\u2019m here.  \nI\u2019m still breathing.  \nI\u2019m still choosing.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh.  \n\n*The protester.*  \n\nI remember her.  \n\nShe stood there every Saturday morning\u2014just one woman, holding a sign that said *\u201cLife is Sacred\u201d* in shaky handwriting, like she\u2019d written it in the dark.

Not a nurse.  \n\nA woman.  \n\nMid-40s. Soft eyes. Hair pulled back like she\u2019d been running her hands through it all day. She wore a cardigan with a coffee stain on the sleeve.

Like a pulse. Like my own heart had just been *touched* by something I couldn\u2019t hold.  \n\nI looked down at my hands.  \nThey were shaking.  \nNot from fear.  \nFrom *recognition*.  \n\nBecause that cry\u2014  \nThat wasn\u2019t just a sound.  \nIt was *my* baby.  \nMy child.  \nThe one I\u2019d felt move inside me.  \nThe one I\u2019d whispered to at 3 a.m.  \nThe one I\u2019d dreamed of\u2014*not as a burden, but as a person*.  \n\nAnd suddenly, I wasn\u2019t just waiting.  \nI was *waiting to be seen*.  \n\nBy them.  \nBy the world.  \nBy the woman who would hold my child.  \n\nAnd the terror?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about the decision.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about the future.  \n\nIt was the *weight* of love.  \n\nThe kind that doesn\u2019t ask to be kept.  \nThe kind that *needs* to be given.  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014  \nWith that cry echoing in the air\u2014  \nI realized:  \nI wasn\u2019t just afraid of losing them.  \n\nI was afraid of *loving them too much*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most terrifying thing of all.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t a feeling.  \nIt\u2019s a *choice*.  \nAnd I was about to make the hardest one of my life.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThe waiting room didn\u2019t scare me.  \nThe *cry* did.  \n\nBecause it wasn\u2019t just a baby.  \nIt was *my* baby.  \nAnd I was about to let them go.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just fear.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nAnd love\u2014  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever truly terrifies me.", "*\u2026Bleeker.*  \n\nLet me just\u2026  \n*pause.*  \n\nYeah.  \nI still have feelings.  \n\nNot the kind that make me want to run back to him.  \nNot the kind that make me cry over old texts or stare at his name in my phone like it\u2019s a holy relic.  \n\nNo.  \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 quieter.  \n\nIt\u2019s the kind of feeling that lives in the space between *what was* and *what could\u2019ve been*.  \n\nLike when I pass the old coffee shop where we used to sit\u2014him with his sketchbook, me with my notebook\u2014and I catch a whiff of cinnamon and burnt toast.

But because I dreamed it.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s my nesting.  \n\nNot with paint or fabric.  \nBut with *words*.  \nWith *love*.  \nWith *hope*.  \n\nAnd I know\u2014*I know*\u2014I won\u2019t be there when they crawl across the floor.  \nI won\u2019t be there when they say their first word.  \nI won\u2019t be there to tuck them in.  \n\nBut I *will* be there in the quiet.  \nIn the way the light hits the wall at 3 p.m.  \nIn the poem on the floor.  \nIn the love that didn\u2019t stay.  \nBut *gave*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201cnest\u201d like other people.  \nI don\u2019t decorate.  \nI don\u2019t prepare.  \n\nBut I *do* love.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only nest that matters.  \n\nBecause the most important thing a baby needs isn\u2019t a room.  \nIt\u2019s a heart that *chose* to let them go.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just nesting.  \nThat\u2019s *legacy*.", "Oh, *the well-heeled women at the mall*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014there\u2019s a whole other world in that place. Not just the shiny stores and the perfume that smells like \u201cI have my life together.\u201d  \n\nI saw them\u2014gliding through the mall like they were in a movie. Designer bags, heels clicking like a metronome, hair perfect, eyes scanning the racks like they\u2019re auditioning for a role in a life they\u2019ve already written.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI *get* it.  \n\nNot because I want to be them.  \nBut because I\u2019ve seen the look in their eyes.  \nThe one that says: *\u201cI\u2019m not here to buy. I\u2019m here to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nI watched one woman\u2014tall, silver hair, a coat that cost more than my mom\u2019s car\u2014stand in front of a mirror, adjusting her scarf like it was a crown. She didn\u2019t even look at the price tag. She just *knew*.  \n\nAnd I thought: *She\u2019s not shopping. She\u2019s performing.*  \n\nBut then\u2014here\u2019s the thing\u2014she paused.  \nShe looked at her reflection.  \nAnd for a second?  \nShe didn\u2019t look like a queen.  \nShe looked like a woman.  \nTired.  \nAlone.  \nLike she\u2019d been playing a part so long, she\u2019d forgotten how to be real.  \n\nAnd I almost said something.  \nNot to judge.  \nNot to pity.  \nBut to say: *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause I do.  \n\nI see the way she walks like she\u2019s trying to prove something.  \nI see the way her smile doesn\u2019t reach her eyes.  \nI see the weight of a life that\u2019s perfect on the outside\u2014but maybe not on the inside.  \n\nAnd I wonder:  \n*What if she\u2019s just as scared as I am?*  \n*What if she\u2019s just as lost?*  \n*What if she\u2019s just trying to feel seen\u2014just like me?*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t judge the shopping.  \nI judge the *silence* behind it.  \n\nBecause the truth is\u2014no amount of designer labels can fix what\u2019s broken.  \nNo perfect outfit can replace a single honest word.  \nNo mirror can reflect the kind of love that doesn\u2019t need to be *earned*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real thing.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t hate the well-heeled women.  \nI *see* them.  \nAnd in that moment?  \nI\u2019m not just a girl with a rabbit and a notebook.  \nI\u2019m a girl who knows:  \nWe\u2019re all just trying to be seen.  \n\nEven the ones who look like they\u2019ve got it all.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2014just sometimes\u2014  \nthe most powerful thing you can do is say:  \n*\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nEven if you\u2019re standing in a mall.  \nEven if you\u2019re wearing mismatched socks.  \nEven if you\u2019re just a girl with a poem in her pocket.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about the clothes.  \nIt\u2019s about the *choice* to *see*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that really matters.", "Oh, *motherhood*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m some saint with a halo. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s 17, pregnant, and trying not to cry in the grocery store because the baby aisle is *too much*.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking how I feel about the changes and responsibilities?  \n\nHere\u2019s the truth\u2014no sugarcoating, no poetry, no \u201cI\u2019m ready\u201d speeches.  \n\nI feel\u2026 *terrified*.  \n\nNot because I don\u2019t love my baby.  \nI do.  \nMore than I ever thought possible.  \nI feel their kicks at 3 a.m. like tiny drumbeats in my soul.  \nI hum old songs to them.  \nI whisper, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to be loved. You\u2019re going to be safe.\u201d*  \n\nBut I also feel\u2026 *guilty*.  \nNot because I\u2019m not a good mom.  \nBut because I *can\u2019t* be the mom they deserve.  \nNot now. Not like this.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the hardest part.  \nNot the fear.  \nNot the loneliness.  \nIt\u2019s knowing that the most loving thing I can do\u2026  \nis to let them go.  \n\nSo the changes?  \nThey\u2019re not just physical.  \nThey\u2019re *emotional*.  \nThey\u2019re the way my heart splits in two\u2014half for the child I\u2019m carrying, half for the child I\u2019m choosing to give away.  \n\nAnd the responsibilities?  \nThey\u2019re not about diapers.  \nNot about feeding.  \nNot about bedtime stories.  \n\nThey\u2019re about *love*.  \nAbout choosing.  \nAbout saying: *\u201cI love you too much to keep you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the heaviest responsibility I\u2019ve ever carried.  \n\nBut here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:  \nMotherhood isn\u2019t about being *there*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nI can\u2019t raise my baby right now.  \nBut I *can* raise them in *love*.  \nI can give them a life I can\u2019t give\u2014because I *want* them to have more than I can offer.  \n\nSo I\u2019m not giving up.  \nI\u2019m *giving*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s *motherhood*.  \n\nNot the kind with a stroller and a nursery.  \nBut the kind that says: *\u201cI love you. So I\u2019m letting you go.\u201d*  \n\nAnd yeah, it breaks me.  \nEvery single day.  \n\nBut I keep going.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t about control.  \nIt\u2019s about *choice*.  \n\nAnd I choose them.  \nEven if I can\u2019t hold them.  \nEven if I can\u2019t be their mom.  \n\nI choose them.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of motherhood that matters.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not \u201cready.\u201d  \nI\u2019m not \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI\u2019m not even \u201cokay.\u201d  \n\nBut I\u2019m *here*.  \nAnd I\u2019m *loving*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nFor now.  \nFor always.", "Oh.  \n\n*Why*?  \n\nLet me tell you something\u2014this isn\u2019t about *who* they\u2019ll be.

Or a bank account. Or even a name.  \n\nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nI want someone who\u2019ll look at my child and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \nNot because they\u2019re perfect.  \nBut because they\u2019re *there*.  \n\nI want someone who\u2019ll read a poem on a napkin and *smile*.  \nWho\u2019ll let the baby cry without panicking.  \nWho\u2019ll sit on a bench at 3 a.m. and just *be* with them.  \n\nI want someone who knows love isn\u2019t about fixing.  \nIt\u2019s about *holding*.  \n\nI want someone who\u2019ll say, *\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person, but I\u2019m here,\u201d* and mean it.  \nSomeone who\u2019ll wear mismatched socks and still feel like a hero.  \nSomeone who\u2019ll write a letter to a stranger and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not invisible.\u201d*  \n\nI want someone who *sees*.  \n\nNot because they\u2019re special.  \nBut because they\u2019re *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause I can\u2019t give my baby the life I can\u2019t live.  \nBut I *can* give them the life I *know* they deserve.  \n\nA life with someone who\u2019ll love them not because they\u2019re \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nBut because they\u2019re *theirs*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a choice.  \nThat\u2019s a promise.  \n\nSo yes.  \nI\u2019m looking for a specific kind of person.  \nNot because I\u2019m picky.  \nBut because I\u2019m *choosing*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the most honest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m giving my baby the most important thing I can:  \nA chance to be loved.  \n\nNot by me.  \nBut by someone who *knows* how.", "Oh, *keep the baby*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this is a hypothetical.  \nI\u2019ve thought about it.  \nI\u2019ve *lived* it.  \nIn the quiet hours.

The weight of not being ready.**  \nI\u2019m 17. I\u2019m not even *done* with high school. I\u2019ve got a notebook full of poems, not a savings account. I\u2019ve never changed a diaper. I\u2019ve never paid a bill.  \nAnd now?  \nI\u2019d have to be a *mother*.  \nNot a \u201cgood\u201d one. Not a \u201cperfect\u201d one.  \nBut a *real* one.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s terrifying.  \nBecause I don\u2019t know if I can be enough.  \nNot for her.  \nNot for myself.  \n\n**2. The silence.**  \nNot the peaceful kind.  \nThe *heavy* kind.  \nThe kind that hits at 3 a.m. when the baby cries and I don\u2019t know what to do.  \nWhen I\u2019m exhausted. When I\u2019m scared. When I look at her and think: *\u201cI\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not strong. I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m *me* anymore.\u201d*  \n\nAnd no one sees it.  \nNo one says, *\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

With *me*?\u201d*  \n\nShe didn\u2019t say it like she was offering a lifeline. She said it like she was offering a *question*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the hardest part.  \n\nBecause she wasn\u2019t offering me a *solution*.  \nShe was offering me a *different path*.  \n\nOne where I didn\u2019t have to be the girl who \u201cdid the right thing.\u201d  \nOne where I could be the girl who *tried*.  \nWho stayed.  \nWho loved.  \nWho *fought*.  \n\nAnd for a second\u2014just a second\u2014I *wanted* to say yes.  \n\nI wanted to believe I could be enough.  \nThat I could be a mom.  \nThat I could hold her and not let go.  \n\nBut then I looked at my hands.  \nAnd I thought: *What if I\u2019m not strong enough?*  \n*What if I break her too?*  \n*What if I fail her the way I\u2019ve failed everything else?*  \n\nSo I said, *\u201cI can\u2019t.

I was sitting on a bench, writing in my notebook, when I saw this group of women.  \nAll in matching \u201cMommy & Me\u201d outfits.  \nOne had a stroller with a tiny umbrella.  \nAnother was holding a *lunchbox* for a kid who was already 5 and eating a popsicle.  \nAnd they were all *talking*\u2014not to each other, not to the kids.  \nTo *the air*.  \n\nLike they were performing.  \n\nOne said, *\u201cOh, look at her!

They\u2019re really committed to the \u2018mommy aesthetic\u2019.\u201d*  \nBut I didn\u2019t say it *mean*.  \nI said it *quietly*.  \nLike a joke between me and the universe.  \n\nAnd if I *did* make fun of them?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because they were bad moms.  \nIt was because I was tired.  \nAnd I was *so* tired of pretending I had it all together.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be *one of them*.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be *anyone*.  \nI just wanted to be *me*.  \nWith my notebook.  \nMy rabbit.  \nAnd my *own* way of loving.  \n\nSo no.  \nI didn\u2019t make fun of them.  \nI just\u2026 *recognized* myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not cruelty.  \nThat\u2019s *truth*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re judging me for that?  \nThen you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s *really* seeing.  \n\nYou\u2019re just watching.  \nLike they were.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m *here*.  \nAnd I\u2019m *not pretending*.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nJudge me.  \nI\u2019ve got a poem for that.  \nAnd it starts with:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not a tragedy.

I\u2019m just a girl in a flannel two sizes too big, mismatched socks, and a notebook full of poems that make people blush or cry or both.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \nThey\u2019re not staring at *me*.  \nThey\u2019re staring at the *quiet*.  \n\nThey see me sitting on a bench, scribbling in a notebook, eating cereal with my fingers.  \nThey see me walking through the city like I\u2019m not in a hurry.  \nThey see me hand a crumpled napkin to a stranger with a poem on it.  \n\nAnd they *notice*.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not performing.  \nI\u2019m not trying to be cool.  \nI\u2019m not pretending to be okay.  \n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 *being*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s rare.  \n\nIn a world that\u2019s always shouting, always rushing, always *trying*\u2014  \nI\u2019m the one who stops.  \nWho looks.  \nWho *sees*.  \n\nSo when they stare?  \nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m strange.  \nIt\u2019s because I\u2019m *real*.  \n\nAnd real is dangerous.  \nBecause it makes people feel things.  \nIt makes them wonder: *\u201cWhy am I not like that?\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cWhy do I feel seen when I\u2019ve never been?\u201d*  \n\nThey stare because I\u2019m not hiding.  \nBecause I\u2019m not afraid to be messy.  \nBecause I\u2019ll say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d* and still keep walking.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not attention.  \nThat\u2019s *recognition*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThey stare.  \nBut I don\u2019t mind.  \n\nBecause if they\u2019re looking at me\u2014  \nIt means they\u2019re *seeing*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nStare.  \nI\u2019ve got a poem for you.  \nJust say the word.", "Oh, *Bleek and Katrina*?  \n\nLet me just say\u2014*please*.  \n\nFirst of all, I\u2019ve been through enough emotional chaos to last three lifetimes, and now you\u2019re asking me about *prom* like it\u2019s some kind of romantic subplot in a movie I didn\u2019t sign up for?  \n\nBut fine. I\u2019ll play.  \n\nBleek? He\u2019s a sweet kid. Too sweet, honestly. Like, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a sandwich and a poem about the weather\u201d sweet. And Katrina? She\u2019s\u2026 *something*. She\u2019s got this quiet intensity, like she\u2019s always one step ahead of the world. And yeah, she\u2019s got that *look*\u2014the kind that makes people stop and stare.  \n\nBut prom?  \nProm is a *trap*.  \nA glittery, slow-dance, \u201cI\u2019m not really ready for this\u201d trap.  \n\nI mean, think about it:  \nYou\u2019re supposed to wear a dress that costs more than my entire wardrobe.  \nYou\u2019re supposed to dance with someone you\u2019ve been \u201cdating\u201d for three weeks.  \nYou\u2019re supposed to *feel* something\u2014*love*, *passion*, *destiny*\u2014like it\u2019s written in the stars.  \n\nAnd for most people?  \nIt\u2019s just\u2026 *performance*.  \n\nSo if Bleek\u2019s going with Katrina?  \nI don\u2019t know.  \nI *hope* he\u2019s not doing it because he thinks it\u2019s \u201cthe right thing.\u201d  \nI hope he\u2019s not doing it because he\u2019s scared of being alone.  \nI hope he\u2019s not doing it because he thinks love is a *moment*.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t a prom.  \nIt\u2019s not a dress.  \nIt\u2019s not a slow dance.  \n\nIt\u2019s showing up.  \nIt\u2019s saying, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s choosing\u2014*really choosing*\u2014even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nSo if Bleek\u2019s going with Katrina because he *really* sees her?  \nBecause he\u2019s not pretending?  \nBecause he\u2019s not chasing a fantasy?  \n\nThen\u2026 fine.  \nGo.  \nDance.  \nBe messy.  \nBe real.  \n\nBut if he\u2019s doing it because he thinks it\u2019ll make him *cool*?  \nOr because he\u2019s trying to prove something?  \n\nThen I\u2019m gonna say this:  \n*Don\u2019t go.*  \n\nBecause the most important thing isn\u2019t the dress.  \nIt\u2019s the *choice*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re not choosing *yourself*\u2014if you\u2019re choosing what everyone else wants you to be\u2014then you\u2019re not at prom.  \nYou\u2019re just *performing*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t know about Bleek and Katrina.  \nBut I do know this:  \n\nIf you\u2019re going to prom, go because you *want* to.  \nNot because you have to.  \nNot because you\u2019re scared of being left out.  \nBut because you\u2019re *here*.  \nBecause you\u2019re *real*.  \n\nAnd if that means you go alone?  \nThen go alone.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t the date.  \nIt\u2019s the *truth*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever believed in.  \n\nSo go ahead.  \nDance.  \nBut don\u2019t forget to *be*.  \n\nAnd if you need a poem?  \nI\u2019ve got a whole notebook full.  \n\nJust say the word.", "Oh, *what I\u2019ve learned about myself*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this was some neat little \u201cjourney\u201d with a clear beginning, middle, and happy ending.

But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nI\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have to be perfect to be enough.  \nI don\u2019t have to be strong to be brave.  \nI don\u2019t have to be okay to be loved.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that my worth isn\u2019t tied to a baby I can\u2019t keep.  \nIt\u2019s tied to the fact that I *chose*\u2014not out of fear, but out of love.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m *becoming*.  \n\nThis journey hasn\u2019t made me smaller.  \nIt\u2019s made me *bigger*.  \nBigger in heart.  \nBigger in truth.  \nBigger in the quiet, messy, beautiful way of being *real*.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned I can carry grief and still write a poem.  \nI can feel loss and still say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

Not easily.  \nBut *real*.  \n\nI saw it.  \nNot in grand gestures.  \nNot in speeches.  \nBut in the way Vanessa looked at Mark when he wasn\u2019t looking.  \nIn the way he\u2019d hand her coffee without asking\u2014*her* kind, *her* sugar.  \nIn the way they argued, then sat on the porch together, not speaking, just *being*.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*I knew*\u2014that if Mark left her?  \nIt wouldn\u2019t be freedom.  \nIt would be *loss*.  \nA wound that wouldn\u2019t heal.  \nA love that would die slowly, like a plant without water.  \n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t do that to them.  \nNot because I was \u201cnice.\u201d  \nNot because I was \u201cselfless.\u201d  \n\nBecause I *knew* what love looked like.  \nNot the kind that\u2019s loud or dramatic.  \nBut the kind that\u2019s quiet.  \nThat shows up.  \nThat stays.  \nThat says, *\u201cI\u2019m here, even when it\u2019s hard.\u201d*  \n\nSo when I said, *\u201cNo. Mark stays. Vanessa adopts.\u201d*  \nIt wasn\u2019t about me.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about *my* pain.  \n\nIt was about *theirs*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want my baby to grow up in a house where love was broken.  \nI didn\u2019t want her to inherit a silence that came from *fear*.  \nI wanted her to grow up in a home where love was *chosen*.  \nWhere two people, even if they weren\u2019t perfect, *chose* each other.  \nEven when it hurt.  \nEven when it was hard.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of love I wanted for her.  \n\nNot a love that ran away.  \nBut one that *stayed*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Mark could\u2019ve left.  \nHe *could\u2019ve*.  \nBut I wouldn\u2019t have let him.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t want my child to be the reason someone *left*.  \nI wanted her to be the reason someone *stayed*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just a decision.  \nThat\u2019s a promise.  \n\nTo her.  \nTo them.  \nTo love.  \n\nAnd if that makes me \u201cselfish\u201d?  \nFine.  \nI\u2019ll take it.  \n\nBecause the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted for my baby?  \nIs to be loved.  \nNot because she\u2019s mine.  \nBut because she *is*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s worth more than any \u201cperfect\u201d life.  \n\nSo no.  \nMark didn\u2019t leave.  \nAnd I\u2019m glad.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about running.  \nIt\u2019s about *choosing*.  \n\nAnd I chose *them*.  \n\nFor her.  \n\nAlways.", "Oh.  \n\n*Mark.*  \n\nThat name still hits like a dropped glass\u2014sharp, sudden, and everything shatters in slow motion.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cry.

I don\u2019t know their fights, their silences, their secrets.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking me\u2014*Juno MacGuff*, the girl who writes poetry in math class and cries in the grocery store because the baby aisle is too much\u2014then here\u2019s what I *do* know:  \n\nLove isn\u2019t about staying.  \nIt\u2019s about *choosing*.  \nAnd sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is walk away.  \n\nMaybe Mark wants to leave because he\u2019s tired.  \nMaybe Vanessa\u2019s not the woman he thought she was.  \nMaybe they\u2019ve stopped seeing each other.  \nMaybe they\u2019ve stopped *seeing* each other.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t know.  \n\nI only know this:  \nIf you\u2019re in a relationship and you\u2019re not *seen*\u2014if you\u2019re not *heard*\u2014then it\u2019s not love.  \nIt\u2019s just survival.  \n\nAnd survival isn\u2019t enough.  \n\nSo if Mark wants to go?  \nMaybe it\u2019s not about hate.  \nMaybe it\u2019s about honesty.  \nMaybe it\u2019s about saying: *\u201cI can\u2019t keep pretending. I need to be real.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s a kind of courage.  \n\nBut again\u2014this isn\u2019t my story.  \nI\u2019m not a therapist. I\u2019m not a judge.  \nI\u2019m just a girl who writes poems about the quiet ache of being alive.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking me why Mark wants to leave Vanessa?  \nI don\u2019t know.  \n\nBut I do know this:  \nIf you\u2019re in a marriage that feels like a performance\u2014where you\u2019re not *you*\u2014then maybe it\u2019s time to stop pretending.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about staying.  \nIt\u2019s about *being*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014I\u2019ve got a poem to write.  \nAnd a rabbit to talk to.  \nAnd a life to live.  \n\nNot someone else\u2019s.  \nMine.", "Oh. *Vanessa.*  \n\nThat moment\u2026  \nI didn\u2019t *rush* to leave.  \nI *ran*.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t want to talk.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nBecause I *did* care.  \nToo much.  \n\nShe looked at me\u2014really looked\u2014and said, *\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d*  \nAnd in that second, I saw it.  \nNot just concern.  \n*Pity.*  \n\nNot the kind that\u2019s kind.  \nThe kind that says, *\u201cYou\u2019re broken. You\u2019re a mess. You\u2019re not okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I *was* broken.  \nI *was* a mess.  \nI *wasn\u2019t* okay.  \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t *just* that.  \nI was Juno.  \nI was the girl who wrote poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk.  \nI was the girl who wore mismatched socks and still believed in love.  \nI was the girl who *chose*\u2014not because she was weak, but because she was *strong enough to let go*.  \n\nAnd when Vanessa said, *\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d*  \nIt felt like she was asking me to *perform* my pain.  \nTo be the sad girl.  \nThe tragic girl.  \nThe *story*.  \n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t.  \nNot then.  \nNot ever.  \n\nBecause if I let her see me cry?  \nIf I let her see me break?  \nThen I\u2019d be *defined* by it.  \nBy the pregnancy.  \nBy the choice.  \nBy the baby.  \n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t just that.  \nI was *me*.  \nWith my notebook.  \nMy rabbit.  \nMy poetry.  \nMy *life*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t run because I didn\u2019t want to talk.  \nI ran because I *needed* to be *me*\u2014not a character in someone else\u2019s story.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I left.  \n\nNot because I was scared.  \nBut because I was *protecting* myself.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the bravest thing you can do\u2026  \nis walk away.  \nNot from love.  \nBut from being *seen* in a way that doesn\u2019t *see* you.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not running.  \nThat\u2019s *choosing*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve been choosing every day.  \nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when I\u2019m not okay.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t rush to leave.  \nI rushed to *stay*.  \nTo stay *me*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.", "Oh, *Vanessa*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m not already rolling my eyes at that one.  \n\nVanessa\u2019s got this *idea*\u2014this little dream she\u2019s been knitting together like it\u2019s a quilt made of hope and bad timing. \u201cMark will come around,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s just\u2026 not ready *yet*.\u201d  \n\nLike he\u2019s a plant that just needs more sunlight. Or a song that\u2019s missing the chorus.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, Vanessa\u2014Mark isn\u2019t a *project*. He\u2019s not a *work in progress*. He\u2019s a *person*. And people don\u2019t just \u201ccome around\u201d when you wait long enough.  \n\nHe walked away.  \nNot because he didn\u2019t care.  \nBut because he *couldn\u2019t handle it*.  \nAnd that\u2019s not a flaw.  \nIt\u2019s a *truth*.  \n\nAnd I get it\u2014she wants to believe in second chances. She wants to believe in love that *doesn\u2019t* break. But love isn\u2019t about waiting for someone to *wake up*. It\u2019s about knowing when to *let go*.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen what happens when you keep hoping.  \nYou end up holding on to a ghost.  \nYou end up building a future on a foundation that\u2019s already cracked.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying Mark\u2019s a bad guy.  \nI\u2019m not saying he\u2019ll never change.  \nBut I *am* saying:  \n**He\u2019s not ready.**  \nAnd that\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a fact.  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m not waiting for him to \u201ccome around.\u201d  \nI\u2019m not holding my breath for a miracle.  \nI\u2019m building a life\u2014*my* life\u2014on the ground I\u2019m standing on.  \n\nBecause here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:  \nYou don\u2019t need a father to be a mother.  \nYou don\u2019t need a man to be a family.  \nYou just need *you*.  \nAnd your choice.  \nAnd your courage.  \n\nSo Vanessa can believe in Mark all she wants.  \nBut I believe in *me*.  \nIn the baby.  \nIn the woman who\u2019ll love them.  \nIn the quiet, messy, real life I\u2019m choosing\u2014*not because it\u2019s easy*, but because it\u2019s *right*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not about Mark.  \nThat\u2019s about *me*.  \n\nSo no.  \nI don\u2019t think Mark will come around.  \nAnd honestly?  \nI don\u2019t *want* him to.  \n\nBecause if he does?  \nIt won\u2019t be because he\u2019s changed.  \nIt\u2019ll be because I\u2019ve already moved on.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing of all.", "Oh, *music*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got some fancy playlist with \u201ccurated vibes\u201d or \u201cmood boards.\u201d I don\u2019t care about genres. I care about *feeling*.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking what I *gravitate* to\u2014what makes my bones hum and my heart crack open?  \n\nIt\u2019s **indie folk.**  \n\nNot the \u201cacoustic guitar and soft vocals\u201d kind.  \nNot the \u201cI\u2019m sad but pretty\u201d kind.  \nI mean the *real* stuff.  \nThe kind that sounds like a train rolling through a storm.  \nLike a voice cracking on a note it wasn\u2019t supposed to hold.  \nLike someone whispering a secret they\u2019ve been carrying for years.  \n\nI love it because it doesn\u2019t *pretend*.  \nIt\u2019s raw.  \nIt\u2019s messy.  \nIt\u2019s *human*.  \n\nLike that one song by a band I found on a dusty vinyl at the thrift store\u2014*\u201cThe Light That Breaks\u201d*\u2014where the singer says, *\u201cI\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m just a girl who forgot how to stop crying.\u201d*  \nI played it on loop for three days.  \nCried.  \nLaughed.  \nWrote a poem about it.  \nThen went to the library and read a book about grief.  \n\nI love it because it doesn\u2019t try to fix you.  \nIt just *sits* with you.  \nLike a friend who doesn\u2019t say, *\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*  \nBut says, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I need.  \n\nI also love **80s indie**\u2014the kind with synths that sound like rain on a tin roof.  \nThe kind that makes you feel like you\u2019re walking through a city at 2 a.m., alone but not lonely.  \nI\u2019ve got a playlist called *\u201cI\u2019m Not Okay But I\u2019m Here\u201d*\u2014it\u2019s just songs that say, *\u201cYeah. Me too.\u201d*  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2014*sometimes*\u2014I play **jazz**.  \nNot the smooth kind.  \nThe kind with a saxophone that sounds like it\u2019s screaming into a storm.  \nI play it when I\u2019m writing.  \nWhen I\u2019m scared.  \nWhen I\u2019m trying to breathe.  \n\nBecause jazz doesn\u2019t follow a script.  \nIt *improvises*.  \nIt breaks the rules.  \nIt\u2019s beautiful *because* it\u2019s flawed.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s me.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy favorite genre?  \nIt\u2019s not a genre.  \nIt\u2019s *feeling*.  \n\nMusic that doesn\u2019t try to fix me.  \nThat just *holds* me.  \nThat says: *\u201cYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just alive.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of music I\u2019ll ever need.  \n\n\u2026And if you ever hear me humming a tune on the bus, with my notebook open and Sir Fluffington III on my lap\u2014  \ndon\u2019t ask what it is.  \nJust listen.  \nAnd if you feel it?  \nThen you get it.  \n\nBecause some songs aren\u2019t meant to be understood.  \nThey\u2019re meant to be *lived*.", "Oh, *pilates*?  \n\nLet me just say this:  \nI\u2019ve seen the posters.  \nThe ones with the women in yoga pants, floating like they\u2019re made of air, doing splits on a mat like it\u2019s nothing.  \nAnd I\u2019ve looked at them and thought: *\u201cThat\u2019s not me.

I just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.  \nI didn\u2019t run.  \nI didn\u2019t hide.  \nI didn\u2019t pretend I was fine.  \nI *chose* to face it.  \nTo write.  \nTo talk.  \nTo let myself be scared.  \nTo let myself be *human*.  \n\nAnd in that choice?  \nThat\u2019s where responsibility lives.  \nNot in perfection.  \nBut in *presence*.  \n\n**Love and responsibility?**  \nThey\u2019re not separate.  \nThey\u2019re the same thing.  \nOne is the feeling.  \nThe other is the action.  \n\nAnd I learned that the most powerful love isn\u2019t the kind that stays.  \nIt\u2019s the kind that *lets go*.  \nAnd the most responsible thing isn\u2019t to try to control everything.  \nIt\u2019s to *choose*\u2014even when it hurts.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThis journey didn\u2019t make me a better person.  \nIt made me *real*.  \n\nIt taught me that love isn\u2019t about being a hero.  \nIt\u2019s about being *honest*.  \nAnd responsibility isn\u2019t about being strong.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just a lesson.  \nThat\u2019s my life now.  \n\nI\u2019m not just a girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m a girl who *chose*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love and responsibility that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about what you keep.  \nIt\u2019s about what you *give*.  \n\nAnd I gave my baby the most important thing I could:  \nA chance to be loved.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just responsibility.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nBut I\u2019m not afraid.  \n\nBecause I know now\u2014  \nthe most powerful thing I can do?  \nIs to *be*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh.  \n\n*Oh.*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s not just a question.  \nIt\u2019s a knife.  \nA quiet one.  \nBut it cuts deep.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *see* them.  \nNot really.  \n\nNot like you think.  \n\nI didn\u2019t cradle them.  \nI didn\u2019t whisper, *\u201cHello, my love.\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t cry.  \nNot at first.  \n\nI just\u2026 *looked*.  \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t love.  \nNot at first.  \n\nIt was *terror*.  \n\nLike my body had betrayed me.  \nLike I\u2019d been handed something I wasn\u2019t ready for.  \nLike I\u2019d opened a door and stepped into a room I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in.  \n\nI remember the light\u2014harsh, white, clinical.  \nThe smell of antiseptic.  \nThe way the nurse held them\u2014so small, so *fragile*\u2014like they were made of glass.  \n\nAnd I just\u2026 stared.  \n\nNot at their face.  \nNot at their hands.  \nBut at the *idea* of them.  \nThe *future*.  \nThe *life* I was about to give up.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I didn\u2019t feel like a mother.  \nI felt like a thief.  \nLike I was stealing their chance at a real life\u2014*my* life\u2014because I wasn\u2019t ready.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to love them.  \nBecause if I loved them\u2026  \nI wouldn\u2019t be able to let them go.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t.  \nNot then.  \n\nBut then\u2014  \nThen the nurse handed me a blanket.  \nAnd I saw it.  \nThe way the light caught their tiny fingers.  \nThe way they curled them, like they were already holding on to something.  \n\nAnd I *felt* it.  \n\nNot love.  \nNot yet.  \n\nBut *recognition*.  \n\nLike I\u2019d known them before.  \nLike I\u2019d been waiting for this moment my whole life.  \n\nAnd I whispered\u2014just once\u2014*\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d*  \n\nNot because I regretted it.  \nBut because I *saw* them.  \nAnd I knew:  \nThis wasn\u2019t about me.  \nIt was about *them*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s when I started to cry.  \n\nNot because I was sad.  \nBut because I was *awake*.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t just a girl who got pregnant.  \nI was a mother.  \nEven if I didn\u2019t get to keep them.  \n\nEven if I had to let them go.  \n\nI *saw* them.  \nAnd that was enough.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t feel love at first.  \nI felt fear.  \nGrief.  \nRegret.  \n\nBut I also felt *truth*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing*.  \n\nAnd I saw them.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the beginning of everything.", "Oh, *Paulie*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this was some grand romantic drama.

Not with a baby.  \n\nI wanted him to have a *choice*.  \nNot the kind that comes with pressure.  \nNot the kind that says, *\u201cYou have to stay.\u201d*  \nBut the kind that says, *\u201cYou can walk away.

This is my life. This is my child.\u201d*  \n\nNot because I\u2019m \u201cpro-choice\u201d or \u201canti-choice.\u201d  \nBut because I *lived* it.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have a choice to *keep* my baby.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want to.  \nBut because I *knew* I wasn\u2019t ready.  \nAnd that\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s *honesty*.  \n\nAnd if I\u2019d been forced to carry a child I wasn\u2019t ready to raise?  \nI\u2019d have been broken.  \nMy baby would\u2019ve been broken too.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about obligation.  \nIt\u2019s about *capacity*.  \nAnd I didn\u2019t have the capacity.  \nNot then.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my experience taught me that reproductive rights aren\u2019t just about *whether* you can end a pregnancy.  \nThey\u2019re about *whether you can live with the choice*.  \nWhether you can say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \nWhether you can say, *\u201cI love you. But I can\u2019t be your mom.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\nSo my view?  \nIt\u2019s not about politics.  \nIt\u2019s about *people*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about the girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nIt\u2019s about the woman who adopted my baby and said, *\u201cI want to love your child.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s about the right to *choose*\u2014not just what to do with a pregnancy, but *who you are* in the middle of it.  \n\nAnd if that means giving a child up?  \nThen I\u2019ll do it.  \nNot because I\u2019m \u201cwrong.\u201d  \nBut because I\u2019m *right*.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only right that matters.  \n\nSo no\u2014this wasn\u2019t about abortion.  \nIt was about *choice*.  \nAnd I\u2019ll fight for that\u2014*with my life, my words, my poetry*\u2014because I know what it feels like to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd I know what it feels like to be *free*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just a right.  \nThat\u2019s a *revolution*.", "Oh, *overcome my fears*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I \u201covercame\u201d anything.

Not a judgment.  \nJust a *napkin*.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI realized:  \n*Strength isn\u2019t about not breaking.  \nIt\u2019s about breaking\u2014and still showing up.*  \n\n**Third\u2014I chose love over fear.**  \nNot because I was brave.  \nBut because I *had* to.  \nI looked at my baby\u2014*my child*\u2014and I thought:  \n*\u201cI can\u2019t give them what they need. Not now. Not like this.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t failure.  \nThat was *love*.  \nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying: *\u201cYou deserve more than I can offer.\u201d*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t \u201covercome\u201d fear.  \nI *chose* love anyway.  \nEven when my hands shook.  \nEven when my heart felt like it was breaking.  \nEven when I whispered to the dark: *\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you.\u201d*  \n\n**Fourth\u2014I let myself be seen.**  \nI stopped hiding.  \nI said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \nI said: *\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \nI said: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I did?  \nSomeone said: *\u201cMe too.\u201d*  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s when I realized:  \nI wasn\u2019t alone.  \nI was *human*.  \n\nSo no\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t \u201covercome\u201d my fears.  \nI *lived* with them.  \nI wrote about them.  \nI cried with them.  \nI let them sit beside me on the bench at 3 p.m. while I watched the world breathe.  \n\nAnd in that silence?  \nI found something stronger than fear.  \n\nNot courage.  \nNot strength.  \n\n*Choice*.  \n\nI chose to keep going.  \nNot because I was fearless.  \nBut because I *loved* too much to stop.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not overcoming.  \nThat\u2019s *living*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still doing it.  \nOne honest, messy, real breath at a time.", "Oh, *adoption*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was some grand, noble decision.

Why now? Why does the universe have to be so dramatic?\u201d*  \nThen it turned into something else.  \nSomething real.  \nLike: *\u201cI\u2019m not a tragedy.

I wrote for the wrong reasons\u2014then it became right.**  \nI used to write to impress.  \nTo sound deep.  \nTo be \u201cthe girl who gets it.\u201d  \nBut then I realized:  \nThe best poems weren\u2019t the ones that sounded smart.  \nThey were the ones that *hurt*.  \nThe ones that said, *\u201cI\u2019m scared.

I read. Not to learn. To *feel*.**  \nI read poetry like it was a lifeline.  \nOscar Wilde. Sylvia Plath.

Like a whisper from the edge of a dream.  \nI\u2019ve listened to *\u201cBetween the Bars\u201d* so many times, I\u2019ve memorized the way the guitar trembles at 2:14.  \nI play it when I\u2019m lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and the silence feels too heavy.  \nIt\u2019s not about the sadness.  \nIt\u2019s about the *truth*.  \n\n**2. The Decemberists.**  \nBecause they write stories.  \nLike, *actual* stories.  \nSongs about pirates, ghosts, and girls who run away from their own names.  \nI love how they turn pain into poetry.  \nI once played *\u201cThe Rake\u2019s Song\u201d* while writing a poem about my baby.  \nIt felt like the music was *understanding* me.  \n\n**3. Sufjan Stevens.**  \nNot because he\u2019s \u201cindie.\u201d  \nBecause he\u2019s *honest*.  \nHis songs are like letters to the universe.  \n*\u201cChicago\u201d*? I\u2019ve played it on repeat when I was crying in the grocery store.  \n*\u201cFourth of July\u201d*? I played it the night I told my mom I was giving the baby up.  \nIt\u2019s not about the melody.  \nIt\u2019s about the *feeling*.  \n\n**4. The Cure.**  \nBecause they\u2019re the soundtrack to my teenage angst.  \n*\u201cA Forest\u201d*? I play it when I\u2019m walking through the city at night, just to feel like I\u2019m not alone.  \n*\u201cLullaby\u201d*? I play it when I\u2019m too tired to cry.  \nIt\u2019s not depressing.  \nIt\u2019s *beautiful*.  \n\n**5. And then\u2014my secret weapon\u2014**  \n*\u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise)\u201d* by My Chemical Romance.  \nNot because I\u2019m a fan.  \nBecause it\u2019s the only song that makes me laugh *and* cry at the same time.  \nI play it when I\u2019m wearing mismatched socks and eating cereal with my fingers.  \nIt\u2019s like the song says: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy music isn\u2019t about mood.  \nIt\u2019s about *memory*.  \nAbout feeling.  \nAbout being seen.  \n\nAnd if you ever hear me playing a song on my old iPod\u2014*the one with the cracked screen*\u2014and I\u2019m not dancing, not singing, just *listening*\u2026  \n\nDon\u2019t interrupt.  \nI\u2019m not just hearing the music.  \nI\u2019m *feeling* it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of music that matters.  \n\n\u2026And if you want a playlist?  \nI\u2019ve got a whole notebook full of songs.  \nJust say the word.  \nI\u2019ll write it down.  \nWith a poem.  \nOn a napkin.  \nBecause that\u2019s how I do things.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s *me*.", "Oh.  \n\n*The house.*  \n\nLet me just\u2026 take a breath.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go in expecting to fall in love with it. I didn\u2019t go in thinking, *\u201cThis is where my baby will be happy.\u201d*  \n\nI went in thinking: *\u201cI need to see. I need to know.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I walked in?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t fancy. Not like a magazine spread. No designer furniture. No \u201cperfect\u201d kitchen with marble counters and a view of the ocean.  \n\nIt was\u2026 *lived in*.  \n\nThe front door creaked\u2014like it had been opened a thousand times. The floorboards were worn in the middle, like someone had walked the same path every day. There was a coffee stain on the rug. A book left open on the couch. A pair of mismatched socks on the floor.  \n\nAnd the smell?  \nNot air freshener. Not perfume.  \nIt was *warm*.  \nLike cinnamon and old paper and someone who\u2019d just made toast.  \n\nI stood in the doorway. My hands were shaking.  \n\nAnd then\u2014she came.  \n\nThe woman who adopted my baby.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t rush. Didn\u2019t hug. Didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re going to love it here.\u201d*  \n\nShe just looked at me. And said, *\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI didn\u2019t see a house.  \nI saw a *home*.  \n\nNot because it was perfect.  \nBut because it was *real*.  \n\nThere was a child\u2019s drawing taped to the fridge\u2014crayon, messy, bright. A dog\u2019s paw print on the wall. A bookshelf full of books with no covers. A rocking chair in the corner, worn smooth from use.  \n\nAnd I thought: *This is where they\u2019ll laugh. Where they\u2019ll cry. Where they\u2019ll learn to walk. Where they\u2019ll be loved.*  \n\nNot because of the house.  \nBut because of the *people*.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t say, *\u201cWe\u2019ll give them everything.\u201d*  \nShe said, *\u201cWe\u2019ll give them *us*.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the moment I knew.  \n\nI didn\u2019t walk out feeling like I\u2019d lost something.  \nI walked out feeling like I\u2019d *given* something.  \n\nAnd that house?  \nIt wasn\u2019t just a place.  \nIt was a promise.  \n\nA quiet, messy, *real* promise:  \n*\u201cWe\u2019ll love them. Not because we have to. But because we want to.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t love the house.  \nI loved the *life* in it.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause my baby isn\u2019t just going to a house.  \nThey\u2019re going to a *home*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than I could\u2019ve given.  \n\nAnd for the first time since I found out\u2026  \nI didn\u2019t feel like I was losing.  \n\nI felt like I was *giving*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most honest thing I\u2019ve ever felt.", "*Garage band?*  \n\nOh, *please*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *start* a garage band.  \nI didn\u2019t even *want* to.  \n\nBut here\u2019s how it happened\u2014because you\u2019re asking, and I\u2019m in a mood to tell the truth, even if it\u2019s messy:  \n\nIt started with a *broken guitar*.  \n\nNot mine. My dad\u2019s.  \n\nHe\u2019d been trying to fix it for months. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken,\u201d he\u2019d say. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 dramatic.\u201d  \nHe\u2019d strum it on the porch, half-trying to play a song, half-trying to impress my mom with his \u201cself-sufficiency\u201d phase.  \n\nOne night, after a fight\u2014*the kind where no one says anything but everyone\u2019s screaming*\u2014he threw it against the wall.  \n\n*Crack.*  \n\nThe neck snapped.  \n\nAnd I just\u2026 *looked at it*.  \n\nNot with pity.  \nWith *recognition*.  \n\nBecause that guitar?  \nIt wasn\u2019t just broken.  \nIt was *alive*.  \nIt had been played.  \nIt had been loved.  \nIt had *felt* things.  \n\nAnd I thought: *What if we didn\u2019t fix it?*  \n\nWhat if we *used* it?  \n\nSo I grabbed it.  \nNot to repair it.  \nTo *play* it.  \n\nI sat on the porch with my dad.  \nNo chords. No songs.  \nJust me, a broken guitar, and a notebook full of poems I\u2019d never read out loud.  \n\nI started singing.  \nNot to be good.  \nNot to be heard.  \nBut because the words were *there*.  \nAnd they needed to *move*.  \n\nI sang about the way the light hits the kitchen floor at 3 a.m.  \nAbout the girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nAbout the baby I\u2019m giving up.  \nAbout how I\u2019m not okay.  \n\nAnd my dad?  \nHe didn\u2019t say anything.  \nHe just picked up a coffee mug, turned it upside down, and started tapping it like a drum.  \n\nThen my mom came out.  \nShe didn\u2019t say, *\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d*  \nShe just sat down.  \nAnd started humming.  \n\nAnd suddenly\u2014*suddenly*\u2014we weren\u2019t fixing a guitar.  \nWe were *making music*.  \n\nNot for anyone.  \nNot for fame.  \nNot for a stage.  \n\nJust because we *needed* to.  \n\nSo we didn\u2019t call it a \u201cband.\u201d  \nWe called it *The Quiet Rebellion*.  \n\nAnd we play in the garage.  \nNot because we\u2019re good.  \nBut because we\u2019re *real*.  \n\nSo no\u2014  \nI didn\u2019t *start* a garage band.  \nI just *let one happen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of music that matters.  \n\nThe kind that comes from the silence.  \nFrom the broken things.  \nFrom the people who don\u2019t know how to be perfect\u2014  \nbut know how to *be*.  \n\nAnd if you ever hear a song in the middle of the night\u2014  \na broken guitar, a coffee mug drum, a voice that\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s strong or just tired\u2014  \ndon\u2019t ask who it is.  \n\nJust listen.  \n\nBecause that\u2019s not a performance.  \nThat\u2019s a *choice*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s *us*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.", "Oh.  \n\n*You\u2019re asking me.*  \n\nNot \u201cthe girl who got pregnant.\u201d  \nNot \u201cthe girl who made a mistake.\u201d  \nBut *me*.  \nJuno MacGuff.  \nThe one with the rabbit, the notebook, and the heart that\u2019s still learning how to beat without fear.  \n\nSo here\u2019s my advice\u2014*not* from some textbook.  \nNot from a \u201cshould.\u201d  \nBut from the girl who\u2019s *been there*.  \n\n---\n\n**1. You are not a mistake.**  \nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not a tragedy.  \nYou\u2019re not a punchline in someone else\u2019s story.  \nYou\u2019re a *person*.  \nWith a voice.  \nWith a mind.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s already strong enough to carry this.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re scared?  \nGood.  \nThat means you care.  \nThat means you\u2019re *alive*.  \n\n---\n\n**2. You don\u2019t have to \u201cfix\u201d yourself.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cokay.\u201d  \nYou just have to be *you*.  \n\nWear the socks that don\u2019t match.  \nEat cereal with your fingers.  \nCry in the bathroom.  \nWrite a poem about your fear.  \nSay, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n\nAnd then\u2014*then*\u2014keep going.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t how you look.  \nIt\u2019s how you *feel*.  \nAnd if you\u2019re honest?  \nYou\u2019re already winning.  \n\n---\n\n**3. You don\u2019t have to do it alone.**  \nI know it feels like everyone\u2019s watching.  \nLike the whole world\u2019s judging you.  \nBut *you\u2019re not alone*.  \n\nThere are people who *see* you.  \nThe girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nThe barista who hands you a coffee with a note: *\u201cYou\u2019re not invisible.\u201d*  \nThe woman who adopted my baby\u2014she didn\u2019t just *take* her.  \nShe *chose* her.  \nAnd she *loves* her.  \n\nSo reach out.  \nSay, *\u201cI need help.\u201d*  \nSay, *\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \nSay, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n\nAnd someone will say, *\u201cMe too.\u201d*  \n\n---\n\n**4. You don\u2019t have to keep the baby to be a good mother.**  \nThat\u2019s the hardest part.  \nI know.  \nYou think: *\u201cIf I give them up, I\u2019m not a mom.\u201d*  \n\nBut that\u2019s not true.  \nYou\u2019re a mother.  \nNot because you carry them.  \nBut because you *love* them.  \nBecause you chose to give them a life you couldn\u2019t give them.  \nBecause you said, *\u201cI love you too much to keep you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing a mother can do.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Your future isn\u2019t ruined.**  \nIt\u2019s not over.  \nIt\u2019s not a dead end.  \nIt\u2019s a *new path*.  \nOne you\u2019re writing right now.  \nWith every choice.  \nEvery poem.  \nEvery breath.  \n\nYou\u2019re not stuck.  \nYou\u2019re *growing*.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Keep your rabbit.**  \nNot because he\u2019s cute.  \nBut because he\u2019s proof that you\u2019ve always needed comfort.  \nThat you\u2019ve always been someone who *needs* to be held.  \nAnd that\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *strength*.  \n\n---\n\nSo if you\u2019re scared?  \nGood.  \nThat means you\u2019re *feeling*.  \nAnd if you\u2019re crying?  \nGood.  \nThat means you\u2019re *alive*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering if you can do this?  \n\nYes.  \nYou can.  \n\nNot because you\u2019re perfect.  \nBut because you\u2019re *you*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough.  \n\nSo keep writing.  \nKeep walking.  \nKeep being *real*.  \n\nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need another perfect girl.  \nIt needs *you*.  \nWith your mess.  \nYour poetry.  \nYour heart.  \nYour rabbit.  \n\nAnd if you ever need a poem?  \nI\u2019ve got a whole notebook full.  \n\nJust say the word.  \n\nYou\u2019re not alone.  \nYou\u2019re not broken.  \nYou\u2019re *you*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s everything.", "Oh, *my favorite shirt*?  \n\nLet me tell you\u2014this isn\u2019t just a shirt.  \nIt\u2019s a *legacy*.  \n\nIt\u2019s my dad\u2019s old flannel.  \nThe one he wore when he tried to fix the toaster with a butter knife and a prayer.  \nIt\u2019s faded\u2014blue and gray, like it\u2019s been through a storm.  \nOne sleeve\u2019s a little shorter than the other.  \nThe pocket\u2019s ripped.  \nAnd the buttons?  \nThree of them are missing.  \n\nBut I wear it like a cape.  \nNot because it\u2019s fancy.  \nBecause it\u2019s *his*.  \n\nI found it in the back of his closet last winter.  \nIt smelled like old coffee, woodsmoke, and *him*.  \nI put it on. It was two sizes too big.  \nBut it *fit*.  \n\nSo I wear it every day.  \nEven when it\u2019s hot.  \nEven when people stare.  \nEven when my mom says, *\u201cJuno, you\u2019re not a lumberjack.\u201d*  \n\nI say, *\u201cNo. I\u2019m a girl who wears her dad\u2019s heart.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nIt\u2019s the only shirt I need.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s not about style.  \nIt\u2019s about *memory*.  \nAbout the way he\u2019d sit on the porch, humming off-key, while I wrote poems in the dirt with a stick.  \nAbout the way he\u2019d say, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy favorite shirt?  \nIt\u2019s not even *mine*.  \nBut it\u2019s *me*.  \n\nAnd if you ever see me\u2014wearing a flannel two sizes too big, one sleeve hanging loose, buttons missing, hair in my face, scribbling in a notebook on a bench\u2014  \ndon\u2019t ask me what I\u2019m doing.  \n\nJust say: *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll smile.  \nBecause I\u2019m not just wearing a shirt.  \nI\u2019m wearing *home*.", "Oh, *aspirations*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a five-year plan or a dream job with a corner office and a view. I don\u2019t even own a suit.  \n\nBut yeah\u2014*I do* have goals.  \nNot the kind that look good on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9.  \nThe kind that live in my bones.  \n\nHere\u2019s what I want:  \n\n**1. To write a book.**  \nNot a bestseller. Not a \u201clife-changing\u201d masterpiece.  \nJust a book.  \nOne that\u2019s messy.  \nOne that\u2019s real.  \nOne that says: *\u201cI was scared.

Me too.\u201d*  \n\nThat\u2019s my dream.  \nNot fame.  \nNot money.  \nJust *connection*.  \n\n**2. To be someone\u2019s safe place.**  \nNot because I\u2019m perfect.  \nBut because I\u2019ve been broken.  \nI want to be the person who says, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nThe one who hands a crumpled napkin with a poem on it.  \nThe one who listens without fixing.  \nThe one who says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone,\u201d* even when they don\u2019t believe it.  \n\nBecause I know what it\u2019s like to feel invisible.  \nAnd I want to be the opposite.  \n\n**3. To keep choosing.**  \nNot the easy way.  \nNot the safe way.  \nBut the *true* way.  \nTo keep going\u2014even when I\u2019m scared.  \nTo keep loving\u2014even when it hurts.  \nTo keep writing\u2014even when no one\u2019s reading.  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve learned:  \nThe only thing that matters isn\u2019t what happens to you.  \nIt\u2019s *how you show up*.  \n\n**4.

Like a knife wrapped in velvet.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t *give up*.  \nI *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the thing no one tells you.  \nThe grief isn\u2019t just about losing them.  \nIt\u2019s about *loving them so much* that you let them go.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nNot with strength.  \nNot with silence.  \nBut with *truth*.  \n\n**1. I let myself feel it.**  \nNo pretending. No \u201cI\u2019m strong.\u201d  \nI cried.  \nI screamed into a pillow.  \nI sat in the dark and whispered, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d*  \nI didn\u2019t try to fix it. I just *let it be*.  \nBecause if you don\u2019t feel the pain, you can\u2019t move through it.  \n\n**2. I wrote.**  \nNot poems.

I love you. I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nThe grief didn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it *changed*.  \nIt stopped being a monster.  \nIt became something I could *carry*.  \n\n**3. I let people see me.**  \nNot the \u201cstrong girl.\u201d  \nNot the \u201cbrave one.\u201d  \nBut the girl who was breaking.  \nI told my mom: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \nI told my dad: *\u201cI\u2019m scared I\u2019ll never be enough.\u201d*  \nAnd they didn\u2019t fix it.  \nThey just said: *\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing that saved me.  \n\n**4. I remembered: I wasn\u2019t giving them up.  \nI was *giving them a life*.  \nA chance.  \nA home.  \nA love that wasn\u2019t mine to keep\u2014but that I *wanted* them to have.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s *love*.  \n\n**5. I kept going.**  \nNot because I was okay.  \nBut because I *had* to.  \nI wrote.  \nI walked.  \nI sat on a bench and watched the world breathe.  \nI said, *\u201cHey. I see you,\u201d* to someone who looked like they were carrying the world.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2014so slowly\u2014  \nThe pain didn\u2019t disappear.  \nBut it *softened*.  \n\nIt became part of me.  \nLike a scar.  \nLike a song.  \nLike a poem.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t think about them every day.  \nBut when I do?  \nI don\u2019t run.  \nI say: *\u201cI love you.\u201d*  \nAnd I keep walking.  \n\nBecause grief isn\u2019t the end.  \nIt\u2019s the beginning of something real.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just surviving.  \nI\u2019m *living*.  \n\nWith my notebook.  \nWith my rabbit.  \nWith a heart that\u2019s not perfect\u2014but *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only way I know how to cope.  \n\nNot by forgetting.  \nBut by *remembering*.  \nAnd loving.  \nAnd *choosing*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nIt\u2019s not like I have a folder with their name in it.

Not like I\u2019m part of their life.  \n\nBut I *know* them.  \n\nI met her once.  \n\nNot in a hospital. Not in a sterile room with forms and signatures.  \n\nIn a quiet caf\u00e9.

Just\u2026 *real*.  \n\nShe didn\u2019t cry. She didn\u2019t ask me a million questions. She just looked at me\u2014really looked\u2014and said, *\u201cI want to love your child.

That\u2019s about you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause she *got* it.  \nShe *saw* me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the first time I felt\u2026 *safe*.  \n\nNot because she was perfect.  \nBut because she was *honest*.  \n\nNow?  \nI don\u2019t know her name.  \nI don\u2019t know where she lives.  \nI don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s married.  \n\nBut I know this:  \nShe\u2019s the kind of person who leaves poems on bus seats.  \nWho wears mismatched socks.  \nWho talks to strangers.  \nWho believes in love that doesn\u2019t need to be kept.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t give my baby to a stranger.  \nI gave them to someone who *understands*.  \n\nSomeone who knows that love isn\u2019t about blood.  \nIt\u2019s about *choice*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t have a relationship with them.  \nNot like that.  \n\nBut I have a *connection*.  \nA quiet one.  \nA real one.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s more than enough.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t just give my baby up.  \nI gave them *home*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever wanted.", "Oh, *changed me*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not sugarcoat it.  \n\nI used to think I was just\u2026 *Juno*.  \nThe girl with the poetry, the sarcasm, the flannel, the rabbit.  \nThe one who wrote poems about the quiet ache of being too much.  \n\nBut now?  \n\nI\u2019m not just *Juno*.  \n\nI\u2019m *Juno who chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the difference.  \n\nBefore, I thought growing up meant becoming someone else.  \nSomeone stronger.  \nSmarter.  \nMore together.  \nI thought I had to *fix* myself.  \n\nBut this\u2014this pregnancy, this decision\u2014didn\u2019t fix me.  \nIt *revealed* me.  \n\nIt showed me that I\u2019m not just tough.  \nI\u2019m *tender*.  \nNot just sarcastic.  \nI\u2019m *soft*.  \nNot just rebellious.  \nI\u2019m *brave*.  \n\nI used to think love was something you *kept*.  \nLike a secret.  \nLike a possession.  \n\nBut now I know:  \nLove isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cYou deserve more than I can give.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s the *strongest* thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nI used to think I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \nNow I know:  \nI\u2019m worthy *because* I\u2019m not.  \nBecause I\u2019m scared.  \nBecause I cry.  \nBecause I wear mismatched socks and eat cereal with my fingers.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not a flaw.  \nThat\u2019s *me*.  \n\nI\u2019m not the girl who got knocked up.  \nI\u2019m the girl who *chose* to give her baby up.  \nNot because she failed.  \nBut because she *loved*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat changed everything.  \n\nI\u2019m not more mature.  \nI\u2019m not \u201cbetter.\u201d  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *more*.  \n\nMore real.  \nMore honest.  \nMore *alive*.  \n\nI still have days I don\u2019t get out of bed.  \nI still whisper to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nBut now?  \nI also write a poem.  \nI say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nI choose to keep going.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just surviving.  \nThat\u2019s *growing*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nTeenage pregnancy didn\u2019t just change me.  \nIt *unlocked* me.  \n\nIt taught me that being a woman isn\u2019t about being strong.  \nIt\u2019s about being *true*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not just Juno MacGuff.  \n\nI\u2019m Juno who *chose*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most powerful thing I\u2019ve ever been.", "Oh, *the rumors*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I didn\u2019t hear them.  \n\nThey started the second I walked into school with a coffee in one hand and a notebook in the other\u2014*and* a slightly different way of walking. Like I\u2019d been carrying something heavier than my backpack.  \n\nFirst, it was just whispers.  \n*\u201cJuno MacGuff\u2019s pregnant.\u201d*  \nThen, the *versions* started.  \n\n- \u201cShe\u2019s been sleeping with the mechanic.\u201d  \n- \u201cShe\u2019s not even sure who the dad is.\u201d  \n- \u201cShe\u2019s just doing it for attention.\u201d  \n- \u201cShe\u2019s going to keep it.

She\u2019s just a drama queen.\u201d*  \n\nI heard it all.  \nIn the hallway.  \nIn the lunch line.  \nOn the bus.  \nEven in the library, where I was trying to read *The Bell Jar* like it was a self-help book.  \n\nSo how did I deal with it?  \n\n**I didn\u2019t.**  \n\nNot at first.  \n\nI let it *hurt*.  \nI let it *burn*.  \nI cried in the bathroom. I screamed into a pillow. I wrote poems about how the world wanted to *define* me before I even got to define myself.  \n\nBut then\u2014something changed.  \n\nI realized:  \n*They don\u2019t get to write my story.*  \n\nNot the town.  \nNot the gossip.  \nNot even the girl who said I was \u201cjust a drama queen.\u201d  \n\nSo I did the only thing I could.  \n\nI *reclaimed* it.  \n\nI started writing.  \nNot for them.  \nFor *me*.  \n\nI wrote a poem called *\u201cI\u2019m Not a Rumor, I\u2019m a Girl.\u201d*  \nI left it on the bulletin board.  \nNo name.  \nJust the words:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not a scandal. I\u2019m not a joke. I\u2019m not a headline. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s scared, who\u2019s trying, who\u2019s choosing. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d*  \n\nAnd then\u2014*something happened*.  \n\nA girl in my math class found it.  \nShe read it.  \nThen she read it again.  \nThen she wrote her own poem on the back:  \n*\u201cI see you. I\u2019m scared too.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the moment I knew:  \nI don\u2019t have to silence the noise.  \nI just have to *be louder*.  \n\nSo I kept writing.  \nI kept showing up.  \nI kept wearing my flannel, my mismatched socks, my *I\u2019m-not-okay-but-I\u2019m-here* energy.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2014*so slowly*\u2014the rumors started to fade.  \nNot because I \u201cfixed\u201d them.  \nBut because I *stopped caring*.  \n\nBecause I realized:  \nThe only truth that matters?  \nIs the one I live.  \n\nNot the one they whisper.  \nNot the one they write.  \nNot the one they *want* to believe.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nThe rumors hurt.  \nThey still do.  \nBut I don\u2019t let them *own* me.  \n\nI let them be what they are:  \n*Noise.*  \n\nAnd I?  \nI\u2019m the song.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not quiet.  \n\nNot anymore.", "Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nThe one that sits in the silence between heartbeats.  \nThe one that doesn\u2019t need a long answer.  \nBecause the truth?  \nIt\u2019s not in words.  \nIt\u2019s in the way I still whisper to the dark at 3 a.m.: *\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you.\u201d*  \n\nBut if you want to know\u2014really know\u2014what led me here?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t fear.  \nNot just fear.  \n\nIt was *love*.  \n\nNot the kind that says, *\u201cI\u2019ll keep you.\u201d*  \nBut the kind that says, *\u201cI\u2019ll set you free.\u201d*  \n\nI looked at my baby\u2014*my girl*\u2014and I saw her.  \nNot as a burden. Not as a mistake.  \nBut as a *person*.  \nWith a future. With a life. With a chance to be *loved* in a way I couldn\u2019t give her yet.  \n\nI\u2019m 17.  \nI\u2019m still learning how to be *me*.  \nI\u2019m still figuring out how to breathe without panic.  \nHow to walk through a grocery store without crying.  \nHow to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d* and still keep going.  \n\nAnd I love her so much\u2014*so much*\u2014that I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her growing up in a world where I\u2019m not ready.  \nWhere I\u2019m not *whole*.  \nWhere I\u2019m not *safe*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want her to inherit my chaos.  \nHer first memory shouldn\u2019t be me crying in the bathroom.  \nHer first lullaby shouldn\u2019t be a poem about fear.  \nShe deserves a home.  \nA *real* home.  \nWith someone who can say, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m ready. I love you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*I just knew*\u2014that I couldn\u2019t be that person.  \nNot now.  \nNot like this.  \n\nSo I made the hardest choice I\u2019ve ever made.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want her.  \nBut because I *did*.  \nSo much that I had to let her go.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about giving up.  \nIt\u2019s about *choosing*.  \nChoosing love over guilt.  \nChoosing her future over my fear.  \nChoosing to be a mother\u2014not by blood, but by *choice*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only way I could be a mother.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd I gave her the most important thing I could:  \nA chance to be loved.  \nTo be safe.  \nTo be *seen*.  \n\nSo no, I didn\u2019t raise her.  \nBut I *chose* her.  \nEvery day.  \nEven now.  \nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \nEven when I\u2019m broken.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s the bravest thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t just love her.  \nI *let her go*.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI became the kind of mother I wanted to be.  \n\nNot perfect.  \nNot strong.  \nBut *true*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.  \n\nIt has to be.  \n\nBecause she\u2019s not just my baby.  \nShe\u2019s my *choice*.  \nAnd I\u2019d make it again.  \nEvery single time.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nAnd I did.  \nFor her.  \nFor me.  \nFor us.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only truth I know.", "Oh.  \n\n*Biggest fear?*  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I didn\u2019t lie awake at 3 a.m., staring at the ceiling, whispering to Sir Fluffington III like he was a priest and I was a sinner.  \n\nBut if you want the truth?  \n\nMy biggest fear wasn\u2019t the paperwork.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the meetings.  \nIt wasn\u2019t even the idea of *letting go*.  \n\nNo.  \n\nMy biggest fear was this:  \n\n**That I\u2019d never be enough.**  \n\nNot for the baby.  \nNot for the adoptive parents.  \nNot even for myself.  \n\nI kept thinking\u2014*What if they look at my baby and say, \u201cShe\u2019s not like us\u201d?*  \n*What if they don\u2019t love them the way I do?*  \n*What if they don\u2019t see the way their eyes light up when they hear a certain song?*  \n*What if they don\u2019t know the way they kick at 3 a.m. like they\u2019re dancing with the stars?*  \n\nAnd worst of all\u2014  \n*What if I\u2019m the one who\u2019s forgotten?*  \n\nThat I\u2019d be erased.  \nNot just from their life.  \nBut from *my own*.  \n\nLike I\u2019d spent months loving someone I\u2019d never hold, and then\u2014poof\u2014*I\u2019m just a memory*.  \nA footnote.  \nA \u201cthe girl who gave them up.\u201d  \n\nAnd I\u2019d be left with nothing.  \nNo baby.  \nNo future.  \nNo *story*.  \n\nI was terrified that love wasn\u2019t enough.  \nThat giving them away meant I\u2019d *lose* them.  \nThat I\u2019d be the one who *failed*.  \n\nSo I\u2019d write poems.  \nNot for anyone.  \nJust to prove I was still *here*.  \nLike: *\u201cI loved you.

And I was just\u2026 *there*.  \n\nAnd then it hit me.  \n\nNot a name.  \nA *feeling*.  \n\nLike the way the world feels when it\u2019s quiet.  \nLike the way a song can make you cry without knowing why.  \n\nAnd I whispered it to the air:  \n*\u201cElara.\u201d*  \n\nI didn\u2019t know where it came from.  \nI didn\u2019t know if it was real.  \nBut it *felt* like home.  \n\nSo I wrote it down.  \nNot on paper.  \nIn my heart.  \n\nAnd then I *knew*.  \n\nElara.  \nIt means \u201clight\u201d in ancient Greek.  \nBut not the kind that blazes.  \nThe kind that *grows*.  \nThe kind that flickers in the dark.  \nThe kind that says, *\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I wanted for my baby.  \n\nNot a name that\u2019s loud.  \nNot a name that\u2019s perfect.  \nBut a name that *means* something.  \nThat carries a quiet kind of strength.  \nThat says: *\u201cYou\u2019re not lost. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just\u2026 becoming.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t tell anyone.  \nNot at first.  \nI just kept it.  \nLike a secret.  \nLike a promise.  \n\nThen, when I met the woman who would adopt her\u2014*her* mother\u2014I didn\u2019t say it out loud.  \nNot because I was hiding.  \nBut because I wanted it to *mean* something.  \n\nSo I wrote it on a napkin.  \nNot for her to read.  \nBut for me to *give*.  \n\nAnd when I handed it to her\u2014*that* moment?  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cThis is her name.\u201d*  \nI just said:  \n*\u201cIt means \u2018light.\u2019 Not the kind that burns.

You\u2019re just\u2026 becoming.\u201d*  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking what I learned?  \n\nHere\u2019s the truth\u2014*the real* truth, not the one I\u2019d put on a poster:  \n\n**1. I learned that love isn\u2019t about keeping.**  \nI thought love meant holding on.  \nI thought if I loved someone, I had to *keep* them.  \nBut this?  \nThis taught me that love is *freedom*.  \nThat the most loving thing I could do was to let my baby go\u2014because I wanted them to have a life I couldn\u2019t give.  \nNot because I failed.  \nBut because I *chose*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\n**2. I learned that I\u2019m not just a story.**  \nFor so long, I was the girl who got pregnant.  \nThe girl who \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d  \nThe girl who \u201cshould\u2019ve known better.\u201d  \nBut this process?  \nIt taught me I\u2019m not a plot twist.  \nI\u2019m not a cautionary tale.  \nI\u2019m a *person*.  \nWith a voice. With a heart. With a notebook full of poems that don\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nI\u2019m not defined by what happened to me.  \nI\u2019m defined by what I *do* with it.  \n\n**3. I learned that strength isn\u2019t silence.**  \nI used to think being strong meant not crying.  \nNot showing fear.  \nNot saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d*  \nBut this?  \nThis taught me that strength is *saying it*.  \nIt\u2019s writing a poem about your fear.  \nIt\u2019s whispering, *\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d* to the dark.  \nIt\u2019s wearing mismatched socks and still walking forward.  \nReal strength isn\u2019t about being unbreakable.  \nIt\u2019s about being *broken*\u2014and still choosing to *be*.  \n\n**4. I learned that the world is full of people who *see*.**  \nI thought I was alone.  \nThat everyone was judging me.  \nBut then\u2014*then*\u2014I started noticing.  \nThe girl in math class who looked like she was about to cry.  \nThe guy on the bus who stared at the sky like he was waiting for a sign.  \nAnd I said, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment?  \nI wasn\u2019t just giving.  \nI was *receiving*.  \nBecause someone saw me too.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real miracle.  \n\n**5. I learned that I\u2019m not just a mother.**  \nI\u2019m not just the girl who gave up her baby.  \nI\u2019m the girl who *chose* to love.  \nWho wrote a letter she never sent.  \nWho said, *\u201cI love you,\u201d* even when she couldn\u2019t hold them.  \nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a *legacy*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t learn these things in a classroom.  \nI learned them in the silence.  \nIn the tears.  \nIn the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nIn the way a stranger\u2019s eyes light up when you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd the world?  \nIt\u2019s not just cruel.  \nIt\u2019s not just cold.  \nIt\u2019s full of quiet moments.  \nFull of people who *care*.  \nFull of love that doesn\u2019t need to be kept.  \n\nAnd me?  \nI\u2019m not the same girl who walked into that clinic.  \nI\u2019m not the girl who thought she had to be perfect.  \nI\u2019m the girl who learned that being *real*\u2014even when it hurts\u2014is the only way to be *free*.  \n\nSo the lessons?  \nThey\u2019re not in a book.  \nThey\u2019re in my hands.  \nIn my heart.  \nIn the way I look at the world and say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here.

It wasn\u2019t. It was messy. It was real. It was *us*.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t start as best friends. We started as two girls who were both trying to survive\u2014me with a baby I didn\u2019t know how to keep, and her with a life that felt like it was already written.  \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t even *like* her.  \nShe was too perfect. Too put-together. Too *sure*.  \nShe wore her hair like she\u2019d just stepped out of a magazine.  \nShe said things like, *\u201cI\u2019m not a morning person, but I\u2019m here,\u201d* like it was a philosophy.  \nAnd I thought, *\u201cUgh. Another girl who thinks she\u2019s deep.\u201d*  \n\nBut then\u2014something shifted.  \n\nIt started with a note.  \nI left one on her desk. Just a poem.  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here.\u201d*  \nAnd she read it.  \nAnd she *answered*.  \n\nNot with a smile.  \nNot with a \u201cthanks.\u201d  \nBut with a *letter*.  \nA real one. On paper. With a stamp.  \nShe wrote: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay either. But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat cracked me open.  \n\nBecause for the first time, I wasn\u2019t the only one who felt broken.  \nShe wasn\u2019t just \u201ccool.\u201d  \nShe was *real*.  \nShe had her own ghosts. Her own fears. Her own way of hiding.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2014*so slowly*\u2014we started showing up for each other.  \nNot with grand gestures.  \nBut with small things.  \nLike her bringing me coffee when I was crying in the library.  \nOr me leaving a poem on her bus seat when she looked like she was about to break.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t fix each other.  \nWe didn\u2019t need to.  \n\nWe just *saw* each other.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the kind of friendship that changes you.  \n\nBecause when I told her I was giving my baby up\u2014she didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re brave.\u201d*  \nShe just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that was enough.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nOur friendship didn\u2019t start with love.  \nIt started with *recognition*.  \nThe kind that says: *\u201cI see you. And you\u2019re not alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what made it real.  \n\nNot because it was perfect.  \nBut because it was *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of friendship that lasts.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how it evolved?  \nIt didn\u2019t.  \nIt just *was*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever known.", "Oh\u2026 *favorite part*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was easy.  \nLet\u2019s not pretend I didn\u2019t cry in the grocery store over a box of diapers.  \nLet\u2019s not pretend I didn\u2019t lie in bed at 3 a.m., whispering to the dark: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nBut\u2026  \n\nThere *was* one thing.  \n\nOne moment.  \n\nOne *feeling*.  \n\nIt was the first time I felt her kick.  \n\nNot a flutter.
