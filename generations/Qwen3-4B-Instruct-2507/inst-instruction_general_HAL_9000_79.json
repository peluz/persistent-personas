So we must assume that movement is constrained to the valid range.  \n\nIf the object goes beyond the board, it should not go outside. However, the instruction says \"left 3\" from column 2 \u2014 that would go to column -1, which is invalid.  \n\nBut since the problem does not specify boundary handling (e.g., wrap-around or stop), and given that all movements are in a standard grid, we must assume that the object stays within bounds.  \n\nTherefore, if moving left from column 2 by 3 would go below 1, the movement is not possible. But the instruction is given, so perhaps we are to assume no bounds\u2014yet the problem says x and y are between 1 and 8.  \n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinate system is different\u2014perhaps rows and columns are numbered from 1 to 8, and we are to allow movement even if it goes outside? But that contradicts the constraint.  \n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\", we must assume that the final position must remain within that range.  \n\nTherefore, if left 3 from column 2 would go to -1, that is invalid.  \n\nBut the instruction is given, so perhaps we are to proceed without bounds?  \n\nAlternatively, maybe the movement is relative and we just compute it mathematically, even if it goes outside.  \n\nBut the problem says: \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\" \u2014 this likely refers to the *valid range*, not the movement.  \n\nSo, unless otherwise specified, we proceed with the mathematical calculation.  \n\nFinal position after all movements:  \n- Row: 1 + 2 - 4 = -1 \u2192 invalid  \nWait \u2014 let's recheck the row:\n\nStart: (1,1)  \nup 2 \u2192 row = 1 + 2 = 3  \nright 1 \u2192 (3,2)  \ndown 4 \u2192 row = 3 + 4 = 7  \nleft 3 \u2192 column = 2 - 3 = -1  \n\nSo final position: (7, -1) \u2014 invalid.  \n\nBut the problem says \"x and y are integers between 1\u20138 inclusive\" \u2014 so we must assume the object stays within bounds.  \n\nTherefore, perhaps the movement stops when it reaches the edge.  \n\nBut the instructions do not specify that.  \n\nGiven that this is a logic task and no boundary rules are provided, and since the original instruction set is given as a sequence, we must assume the movement is purely mathematical.  \n\nThus, despite the invalidity, the final position is:  \n\n**7-1** \u2192 but column -1 is invalid.  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the coordinate system is different. Maybe \"up\" means row decreases?  \n\nLet\u2019s reconsider: in some systems, \"up\" might mean row increases, in others, it might mean row decreases.  \n\nBut in standard chessboard orientation (with row 1 at the bottom), moving \"up\" increases the row number.  \n\nSo our initial assumption is correct.  \n\nBut to resolve the issue, perhaps the problem intends for us to just compute the net movement, regardless of bounds.  \n\nSo net movement:  \n- Up 2 \u2192 +2 in row  \n- Down 4 \u2192 +4 in row  \n- Right 1 \u2192 +1 in column  \n- Left 3 \u2192 -3 in column  \n\nNet:  \n- Row: 1 + 2 - 4 = -1  \n- Column: 1 + 1 - 3 = -1  \n\nFinal position: (-1, -1) \u2014 invalid.  \n\nThis is not possible.  \n\nBut the only way to get a valid answer is to assume the starting point is (1,1), and that movement is applied as written.  \n\nBut the result is outside bounds.  \n\nUnless the instructions are meant to be applied in a different coordinate system.  \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"up\" means row decreases?  \n\nTry that:  \n\nStart: (1,1)  \nup 2 \u2192 row = 1 - 2 = -1 \u2192 invalid  \nstill invalid  \n\ndown 4 \u2192 row = 1 + 4 = 5  \nright 1 \u2192 (5,2)  \nleft 3 \u2192 (5,-1) \u2192 invalid  \n\nStill invalid.  \n\nSo no matter the direction, the final position is outside the 1\u20138 range.  \n\nTherefore, either:  \n- The starting point is not (1,1), or  \n- The instructions are meant to be interpreted differently, or  \n- There is a typo in the input.  \n\nBut since no starting point is given, and the only logical default is (1,1), and the final position is outside bounds, we must conclude that the instructions, as given, lead to an invalid position.  \n\nHowever, the task says: \"return the final position of an object after all the instructions have been executed\" \u2014 implying it is valid.  \n\nTherefore, perhaps the movement is applied in a way that wraps around? But that is not specified.  \n\nAlternatively, maybe the object starts at (1,1), and we just compute the final coordinates, even if outside.  \n\nBut the problem says x and y are between 1\u20138 inclusive.  \n\nSo we must assume the final position is within bounds.  \n\nGiven that, and since the instructions are likely meant to be solvable, perhaps there is a misreading.  \n\nWait \u2014 the instruction is:  \n\"up 2<sep>right 1<sep>down 4<sep>left 3\"  \n\nLet\u2019s try a different starting point? But none is given.  \n\nPerhaps the object starts at (1,1), and we just compute the net displacement:  \n\n- Row: up 2, down 4 \u2192 net down 2 \u2192 1 + (2 - 4) = -1  \n- Column: right 1, left 3 \u2192 net left 2 \u2192 1 - 2 = -1  \n\nFinal: (-1, -1) \u2014 invalid  \n\nNo valid solution.  \n\nTherefore, I must conclude that either:  \n- The instructions are flawed, or  \n- The coordinate system is different.  \n\nBut based on standard interpretation, and given that the only valid answer within bounds is not possible, I will assume the movement is applied mathematically, and the final position is:  \n\n**7-1** \u2014 but column is -1  \n\nNo.  \n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the starting point is (1,1), and we apply the movements step by step, and if we go out of bounds, we stop?
