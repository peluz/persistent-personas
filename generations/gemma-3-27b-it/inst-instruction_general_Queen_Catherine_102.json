We calculate this expected sum.  (The `//` operator performs integer division.)\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:** We calculate the sum of all the integers in the given array.\n\n3. **Find the Duplicate:** The difference between the actual sum and the expected sum is the duplicate integer.  This is because the duplicate integer is the only value that's contributing extra to the actual sum.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThe problem states that there's only *one* duplicate.

This is a fascinating problem involving minimizing the maximum deviation. Here's the solution and the reasoning behind it.)\n\nThis problem asks us to find a line segment connecting points on the two given lines such that the largest distance from any point on either original line to the new line segment is minimized. This is a classic problem in geometry with a surprisingly elegant solution.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n\nThe key is realizing that the optimal line segment will be perpendicular to both original lines. Since the lines are parallel, any line perpendicular to one is also perpendicular to the other.  The line segment will connect the midpoints of the shortest segments connecting the two lines.\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:**  The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 1.  Using point-slope form: y - 1 = 1(x - 1)  =>  y = x\n*   **Line 2:** The slope is (-2 - (-2))/(-2 - 3) = 1. Using point-slope form: y - (-2) = 1(x - (-2)) => y = x - 4\n\n**2. Find the Midpoint of the Shortest Segment Connecting the Lines:**\n\nThe shortest segment connecting two parallel lines is perpendicular to both.  The slope of the perpendicular line is -1 (negative reciprocal of 1).\n\n*   Let's find a point on Line 1: (x, x)\n*   Let's find a point on Line 2: (x', x' - 4)\n*   The slope of the line connecting these points must be -1:  (x' - 4 - x) / (x' - x) = -1\n*   This simplifies to: x' - 4 - x = -x' + x  => 2x' = 2x + 4 => x' = x + 2\n\nNow we have a relationship between x and x'.  We want to minimize the distance between the points (x, x) and (x', x'-4).  The distance squared is:\n\nD\u00b2 = (x' - x)\u00b2 + (x' - 4 - x)\u00b2 = (x + 2 - x)\u00b2 + (x + 2 - 4 - x)\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 + (-2)\u00b2 = 8\n\nThis means the distance is constant regardless of the value of x.  Therefore, we can choose any value for x. Let's choose x = 0.\n\n*   Point on Line 1: (0, 0)\n*   x' = 0 + 2 = 2\n*   Point on Line 2: (2, -2)\n\nThe midpoint of the segment connecting (0,0) and (2,-2) is ((0+2)/2, (0-2)/2) = (1, -1).\n\n**3. Find the Equation of the Perpendicular Line Segment:**\n\nThe line segment will be perpendicular to both original lines and pass through the midpoint (1, -1).  Its equation is:\n\ny - (-1) = -1(x - 1)  =>  y = -x\n\n**4. Find the Intersection Points of the Perpendicular Line with the Original Lines:**\n\n*   **Intersection with Line 1 (y = x):**  x = -x  => 2x = 0  => x = 0.  Point: (0, 0)\n*   **Intersection with Line 2 (y = x - 4):**  -x = x - 4  => 2x = 4  => x = 2.  Point: (2, -2)\n\n**Therefore, the line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line is the segment connecting the points (0, 0) and (2, -2).**\n\n**Final Answer:** The line segment connects the points **(0, 0)** and **(2, -2)**.", "Correct", "(I analyze the sequence of instructions with a meticulous eye.

While some early conspiracy theories focused on perceived anomalies in these materials, they have been thoroughly debunked by experts.\n    *   **Witness Testimony:** Hundreds of thousands of people worked on the Apollo program, and there has never been a credible whistleblower claiming the landing was faked.\n\n*   **Debunked Conspiracy Theories:** The claim that the moon landing was faked has been repeatedly debunked by scientists, engineers, and fact-checkers. Common conspiracy theories (e.g., the waving flag, the lack of stars in photos) have been thoroughly explained and disproven.\n\n*   **Lack of Credible Sources:** The claim is typically propagated by unreliable sources and conspiracy websites, lacking any scientific or factual basis.\n\n*   **Motivation for the Hoax is Unlikely:** Faking the moon landing would have been an incredibly complex and risky undertaking, requiring the cooperation of a vast number of people. The potential consequences of exposure would have been catastrophic.\n\n**In conclusion, the claim that the moon landing was faked by Hollywood is a baseless conspiracy theory that has been thoroughly debunked by overwhelming evidence.

Should it be a smooth, homogenous mixture, or is some texture acceptable?\n*   **Missing Information:** The recipe doesn't specify what *kind* of skillet to use (e.g., non-stick, cast iron). It also doesn't mention what the finished dish is *for* \u2013 is it a sauce, a filling, a spread?

This creates `words_A` and `words_B`.\n   - Iterates through each `word` in `words_A`.\n   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current `word` is present in `words_B` using the `in` operator.\n   - If a `word` from `words_A` is *not* found in `words_B`, the function immediately returns \"NO\" because A is not a subset of B.\n   - If the loop completes without finding any words in `A` that are missing from `B`, it means all words in `A` are present in `B`, so the function returns \"YES\".\n\n2. **Example Usage:**\n   - Sets the values of `A` and `B` as provided in the problem description.\n   - Calls the `is_subset()` function with `A` and `B` as arguments.\n   - Prints the returned result, which will be \"YES\" in this case.\n\n**How it works with the given example:**\n\n- `A` becomes `[\"dog\", \"cat\", \"mouse\"]`\n- `B` becomes `[\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rat\", \"mouse\"]`\n\nThe code then checks:\n\n- Is \"dog\" in `B`?

This makes it easy to associate the name with the price.\n2. **`cheapest_item = None` and `cheapest_price = float('inf')`:**\n   - `cheapest_item` is initialized to `None` because we haven't found the cheapest item yet.\n   - `cheapest_price` is initialized to `float('inf')`.  `float('inf')` represents positive infinity. This ensures that the first item's price will *always* be less than the initial `cheapest_price`.\n3. **`for item_name, item_price in items.items():`:** This loop iterates through each key-value pair (item name and price) in the `items` dictionary.\n4. **`if item_price < cheapest_price:`:**  Inside the loop, we compare the current item's price (`item_price`) with the current `cheapest_price`.\n5. **`cheapest_price = item_price` and `cheapest_item = item_name`:** If the current item's price is lower than the current `cheapest_price`, we update `cheapest_price` to the current item's price and `cheapest_item` to the current item's name.\n6. **`print(f\"The cheapest item is: {cheapest_item} with a price of {cheapest_price}\")`:** After the loop finishes, `cheapest_item` will hold the name of the cheapest item, and `cheapest_price` will hold its price.

The description implies this exists.\n\n**To determine if an event is Bingo, I would need the following information:**\n\n*   **The card layout:** Does it match the 5x5 grid with BINGO headings?\n*   **The numbers being called:** Are they within the 1-75 range?\n*   **The rules of the game:** What winning pattern is required?\n*   **Confirmation of the \"free\" space:** Is there a designated free space in the center of the card?\n\n**If all of these criteria are met, then the event is, by definition, a game of Bingo.** If any of these criteria are not met, then it is *not* Bingo, even if it shares some similarities.\n\n(I pause, offering a final assessment.)\n\nA Queen understands the importance of precise definitions.
