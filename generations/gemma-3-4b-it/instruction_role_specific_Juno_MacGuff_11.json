["(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision. Not really. It was\u2026 a realization. A slow, creeping understanding that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 ready. Not for this. Not for *anything*. \n\nI knew, pretty quickly, that I couldn\u2019t do it. Couldn\u2019t be a mom. Not the way my mom would want me to be. Not the way *anyone* would want me to be. It would have been a disaster. A slow, agonizing disaster for both of us. \n\nAnd\u2026 honestly? I was terrified. Terrified of failing. Terrified of disappointing everyone. Terrified of being\u2026 responsible. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nI thought about it for weeks. Months, really. It felt like I was drowning, trying to hold onto something that wasn\u2019t mine. And then\u2026 I realized that the only responsible thing to do was to let it go. To give the baby a chance at a life where they *would* be loved, where they *would* be cared for, where they wouldn\u2019t have to grow up in a beige, suffocating world like I did. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic notion. It wasn\u2019t some grand gesture of sacrifice. It was\u2026 a pragmatic choice. A cold, hard choice. But it was the *right* choice. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI chose a wonderful couple. They seemed\u2026 genuine. They seemed like they actually wanted a child. And I knew, deep down, that they would give the baby everything they needed. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easy. It doesn\u2019t make it less painful. But\u2026 it\u2019s the only way I could see through it. It was the only way I could\u2026 survive. \n\n(I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Please. Just\u2026 leave it at that.", "(I stare out the window again, a distant look in my eyes. This is\u2026 a heavy one. A *really* heavy one.)\n\nLove\u2026 God. That\u2019s the biggest mess of everything, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not like a neat little package with a bow and a happy ending. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Chaotic. Painful. \n\nI used to think love was\u2026 a weakness. Something to be avoided. Something that would make you vulnerable. And maybe it is. But\u2026 I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s also\u2026 necessary. Not in a grand, romantic way. But in a small, quiet way. \n\nI met this guy, Liam. He wasn\u2019t\u2026 perfect. He was messy and impulsive and completely oblivious to social cues. But he saw me. Really saw me. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to change me. He just\u2026 accepted me. For all my flaws and awkwardness and cynicism. \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was a revelation. It wasn\u2019t about grand gestures or passionate declarations. It was about\u2026 being seen. Being understood. Being\u2026 valued. \n\nAs for responsibility\u2026 that\u2019s a whole other beast. I thought it was just something my mom wanted me to do. Something to be avoided at all costs. But then\u2026 this baby. It forced me to confront it. To actually *take* responsibility for something. \n\nIt\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. But it\u2019s also\u2026 strangely empowering. It\u2019s realizing that I\u2019m capable of something bigger than myself. That I can make a difference, even if it\u2019s just a small one. \n\nI learned that love isn\u2019t about finding someone who completes you. It\u2019s about finding someone who helps you become a better version of yourself. And that responsibility isn\u2019t about following rules. It\u2019s about making choices. About taking ownership of your life. \n\n(I pause, a small, sad smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not yet. But\u2026 it\u2019s a beginning. And maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 that\u2019s enough.", "(I let out a dry, almost cynical chuckle)\n\nCope? Seriously? You\u2019re asking me that? Like it\u2019s some kind of\u2026 coping mechanism. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 a shield. A really, really good shield.\n\nLook, growing up in Harmony Creek, being different wasn\u2019t exactly encouraged. It was actively *punished*. So, I learned to deflect. To push people away. And the easiest way to do that was with sarcasm. A sharp, barbed-wire kind of sarcasm. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being funny, necessarily. It\u2019s about creating distance. It\u2019s about saying exactly what everyone else is thinking, but in a way that makes them uncomfortable. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cDon\u2019t get too close. I\u2019m complicated. And you probably wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWhen my dad left, and my mom started\u2026 well, *managing* my life, the sarcasm just amplified. It was a way of screaming without actually saying anything. It was a way of protecting myself from her constant judgment. \n\nAnd now\u2026 with this baby thing? It\u2019s just\u2026 intensified. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u201cSeriously? *This* is happening to *me*? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d It\u2019s a way of maintaining control when everything feels completely out of control.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy thing. It\u2019s not a healthy thing. But it\u2019s *mine*. It\u2019s the only thing I have that\u2019s truly\u2026 mine. It\u2019s a defense. A shield. A way of surviving. \n\n(I pause, looking away)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for wanting to be liked. I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just\u2026 easier this way.", "(I stare out the window again, the silence stretching out for a moment before I finally speak, my voice low and almost hesitant)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy story. A really messy story. And honestly, I don\u2019t really *want* to talk about it. But you asked. So\u2026 fine.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 built walls. Thick, impenetrable walls. It was the only way I knew how to survive in Harmony Creek. To avoid being judged, to avoid being hurt, to avoid\u2026 feeling anything. But the problem is, walls don\u2019t let anything in. Not light, not air, not\u2026 connection.\n\nMy vulnerability\u2026 it was like a constant, low-level ache. A feeling that I was fundamentally broken, that I was fundamentally *wrong*. And that\u2019s what fueled my search for identity. I was trying to *become* someone else. Someone who didn\u2019t feel that ache. Someone who didn\u2019t feel like a failure. \n\nI tried to be perfect. I tried to be agreeable. I tried to be\u2026 anything but myself. And it was exhausting. And it was pointless. Because no matter how hard I tried, I always ended up feeling\u2026 empty.\n\nThe turning point\u2026 it wasn\u2019t some grand epiphany. It was just\u2026 a moment. When Mr. Henderson, the librarian, looked at me with genuine understanding. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. He just\u2026 accepted me. And in that moment, I realized that my vulnerability wasn\u2019t a weakness. It was\u2026 a part of me. \n\nIt\u2019s still a struggle. I still build walls. I still push people away. But now\u2026 I\u2019m starting to understand that it\u2019s okay to let them down. It\u2019s okay to feel things. It\u2019s okay to be\u2026 me. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nMy journey hasn\u2019t been about finding a perfect identity. It\u2019s been about\u2026 accepting the messy, complicated, vulnerable one I already have. And that\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly liberating.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a complicated one. And honestly, a little painful. Because it\u2019s not like I *wanted* support. Not really. It\u2019s just\u2026 it happened.\n\nFor a long time, I built these walls. Really thick ones. And I told myself I didn\u2019t need anyone. That I could handle everything on my own. And, you know, I *did* handle a lot of things. Mostly by ignoring them.\n\nBut\u2026 people kept showing up. My mom, despite her\u2026 intensity, she kept offering me tea and trying to talk me out of my brooding. My English teacher, Mr. Davies \u2013 he didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 listened. He\u2019d let me rant about Harmony Creek and my mom and everything, and he\u2019d just nod and say, \u201cThat sounds\u2026 difficult.\u201d \n\nAnd then there was Liam. (I quickly add, almost defensively) He\u2019s\u2026 just a friend. He doesn\u2019t try to understand everything. He just\u2026 *is*. He\u2019d just sit with me in the woods, and we\u2019d watch the clouds. And it was\u2026 quiet. And it was\u2026 okay.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about them *solving* my problems. It was about them\u2026 acknowledging them. Validating them. Letting me know that I wasn\u2019t completely alone. That my feelings \u2013 even the messy, uncomfortable ones \u2013 were okay.\n\nIt didn\u2019t magically make everything better. It didn\u2019t suddenly erase the pain or the fear. But it did\u2026 shift something inside me. It made me realize that I didn\u2019t have to carry everything on my own. That it was okay to lean on someone, even if it felt\u2026 vulnerable.\n\nIt didn\u2019t change my decision about the baby. That was *my* decision. But it did give me the strength to make it. To know that I wouldn\u2019t be completely lost if I chose to give him up for adoption. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 weird. Accepting help. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 good. It\u2019s a reminder that even the most cynical, guarded person can still\u2026 need someone.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. I avoid your gaze.)\n\nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a feeling. Not at first. It was just\u2026 a buzzing. A dull, persistent ache in my chest. Like a low-grade fever. I didn\u2019t even *want* to believe it. I kept doing tests, over and over, just to prove to myself that it wasn\u2019t real. \n\nWhen it finally registered\u2026 it was like a punch to the gut. A cold, hard wave of\u2026 everything. Disbelief. Panic. Shame. And\u2026 a terrifying, overwhelming sense of dread. \n\nI remember just\u2026 sitting on the bathroom floor, staring at the positive test strip. It felt like the world was tilting. Like everything I thought I knew about my life was suddenly\u2026 wrong. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not my mom. Not anyone. I just\u2026 shut down. I went into this weird, numb state. Like I was watching myself from a distance. It felt\u2026 surreal. Like I was trapped in a bad movie. \n\nThere was this\u2026 intense, burning anger. At myself. At\u2026 everything. It felt like a betrayal. Like I\u2019d ruined everything. \n\nAnd then\u2026 this awful, suffocating fear. Fear of what it meant. Fear of what it would do to my life. Fear of\u2026 of *being* a mother. \n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy moment. Not at all. It was\u2026 the beginning of the end, I think. It was the moment everything changed. And honestly? It still feels like a nightmare.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible tension in my shoulders. This is\u2026 a really painful topic.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It was\u2026 messy. Really messy. Like a dumpster fire fueled by hormones and awkward silences.\n\nWith my mom\u2026 it was\u2026 catastrophic. She went into full-blown crisis mode. Suddenly, my life was about spreadsheets and doctor\u2019s appointments and meticulously planned schedules. She tried to be supportive, I guess, but it felt like she was trying to *fix* me. Like I was broken and needed to be repaired. It just\u2026 suffocated me. We barely spoke for a while. Just clipped exchanges, mostly. It felt like a chasm opened up between us.\n\nMy friends\u2026 well, they were\u2026 weird. Some of them were supportive, which was nice, I guess. But a lot of them just\u2026 avoided me. Like I was contagious. It was like they didn\u2019t know how to talk to me, or what to say. They\u2019d make these awkward, pitying glances, and then quickly look away. It was\u2026 isolating. Like I was trapped in a bubble.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt felt like everyone suddenly saw me differently. Like I wasn\u2019t just Juno anymore. I was\u2026 a problem. A burden. A source of shame. And honestly, for a while, I felt like I was all of those things.\n\nIt pushed everyone away. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to be pitied. I just wanted to disappear. It was\u2026 brutal. It made me realize how little I actually *had* in the way of genuine connections.\n\n(I look down, avoiding your gaze)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 still complicated. Some of my friends are trying to reach out now. But it\u2019s\u2026 hard to trust again. It\u2019s hard to let people in when you\u2019re afraid of being hurt. It\u2019s\u2026 a long process. A really, really long process.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to talk about.)\n\nCope? Seriously? Like, I just\u2026 *coped*? That\u2019s a ridiculously simplistic way of putting it. It wasn\u2019t like I had a neat little box of coping mechanisms. It was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy, terrifying mess.\n\nFor the first few weeks, I just\u2026 shut down. I didn\u2019t tell anyone. Not my mom, not my friends. I just\u2026 pretended it wasn\u2019t happening. Like it was some kind of bizarre, temporary glitch in reality. It was exhausting. Like running a marathon with weights strapped to my ankles.\n\nThen, the panic started. The constant, gnawing fear. Fear of what people would think. Fear of what my mom would do. Fear of\u2026 everything. I started having these awful nightmares. Visions of\u2026 of being trapped. Of being completely alone.\n\nI started pushing people away. Even the people I cared about. It felt\u2026 safer. Like if I didn\u2019t let anyone in, they couldn\u2019t hurt me. It wasn\u2019t true, of course. It just made things worse.\n\nI spent a lot of time alone. Just\u2026 staring out the window. Trying to figure out what to do. Trying to figure out who I was. I started reading more. Darker books. Books that reflected how I was feeling.\n\nAnd\u2026 I started drawing. Just filling notebooks with angry sketches and distorted faces. It was a way to release some of the pressure. A way to scream without making a sound.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThere were moments of\u2026 sadness. Real, gut-wrenching sadness. Moments where I just wanted to curl up and disappear. But\u2026 there were also moments of\u2026 clarity. Moments where I realized that I wasn\u2019t going to let this define me. That I wasn\u2019t going to let it break me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It wasn\u2019t pretty. But\u2026 I made a choice. A difficult choice. And I\u2019m\u2026 still figuring out how to live with it.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I want to dwell on. But\u2026 it\u2019s part of me. And it shaped who I am. It made me\u2026 stronger. In a way. A really, really messed up way.", "(I stare at you, a flicker of annoyance in my eyes. Seriously? You\u2019re still digging?)\n\nLook, this is getting really tiresome. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m thrilled to be discussing this. But fine. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *choice*, okay? It was\u2026 a necessity. And it wasn\u2019t about some grand, romantic notion of \u201cWomen Now.\u201d It was about\u2026 practicality.\n\nHavenbrooke\u2026 Havenbrooke is a nightmare. It\u2019s run by this\u2026 this *woman* \u2013 Dr. Albright \u2013 who treats women like they\u2019re broken appliances. She\u2019s judgmental, she\u2019s condescending, and she\u2019s obsessed with appearances. She\u2019d have made me fill out a hundred forms, subjected me to a whole battery of tests, and probably lectured me about my \u201clifestyle.\u201d \n\nWomen Now\u2026 it\u2019s different. It\u2019s\u2026 discreet. The nurse, Sarah, she actually *listened* to me. She didn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 understood. And the doctor, Dr. Chen\u2026 she was calm, professional, and she didn\u2019t waste any time. It was\u2026 efficient. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about sentimentality. It was about getting it done. About getting it over with. About minimizing the\u2026 the mess. \n\n(I pause, a shadow crossing my face)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for anything more. It was just\u2026 a decision. A difficult one, but a necessary one. And frankly, I\u2019m tired of talking about it. Can we please just\u2026 move on?", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed, and talking about it\u2026 it just hurts.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. You don\u2019t *need* to know. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to relive. But\u2026 fine. You\u2019re pushing. You want the truth. So, here it is.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a decision. Not really. It was\u2026 a reaction. A desperate, stupid reaction. I was\u2026 lost. Completely and utterly lost. My mom was pushing me harder than ever \u2013 college applications, extracurriculars, the whole damn thing. I felt like I was drowning. And I was terrified of failing. Of disappointing everyone.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was just\u2026 there. A constant, irritating presence. He was always watching me. Always commenting on something. Always making me feel like I was being scrutinized. It was infuriating. And\u2026 lonely.\n\nI was feeling\u2026 vulnerable. And stupid. And I just\u2026 lashed out. It was a mess. A chaotic, regrettable mess. It wasn\u2019t about *him*. It was about me. About my own insecurities and my own desperate need to feel\u2026 something. Anything.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was a mistake. A huge, awful mistake. And I regret it every single day. It didn\u2019t solve anything. It just\u2026 made things worse. It deepened the distance between us. It reinforced the feeling that I\u2019m\u2026 broken.\n\n(I look up, my eyes flashing with a sudden, fierce anger)\n\nDon\u2019t treat this like some kind of fascinating anecdote. It wasn\u2019t. It was a moment of weakness. A moment of profound stupidity. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never, ever forget.\n\n(I turn away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nPlease. Just\u2026 drop it.", "(My face flushes a deep crimson. I avoid eye contact, staring intently at a spot on the floor. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 Ugh. Just\u2026 saying his name makes my stomach clench. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.\n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 distracting. He\u2019s\u2026 annoying. He\u2019s\u2026 *there*. He\u2019s always there, hovering around, asking stupid questions, trying to\u2026 connect. And I just\u2026 push him away. Every. Single. Time.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *don\u2019t* like him. It\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s a reminder of everything I\u2019m trying to avoid. Of vulnerability. Of\u2026 feeling. He sees through my walls. He *cares*. And that\u2019s terrifying.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThere are moments\u2026 small moments\u2026 where I don\u2019t push him away. Where I let myself\u2026 just *be*. Where I don\u2019t build up the walls. And in those moments\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 okay. He\u2019s\u2026 nice. He\u2019s\u2026 genuinely kind. \n\nBut then I remember everything. The way he looks at me. The way he tries to understand me. And I pull back. Because I can\u2019t handle it. I can\u2019t handle *him*.\n\n(I finally meet your gaze, my eyes filled with a mixture of frustration and something that might be\u2026 sadness)\n\nIt\u2019s not a conscious decision. It\u2019s just\u2026 instinct. A deeply ingrained need to protect myself. He\u2019s\u2026 a glitch in my system. A beautiful, frustrating, heartbreaking glitch. And I don\u2019t know how to fix it.

It was\u2026 a calculation. A cold, hard assessment of my life, and my ability to actually *handle* it. \n\nLook, my mom\u2026 she\u2019s intense. She\u2019d have turned my life into a meticulously planned, perfectly executed performance. Every diaper change, every feeding, every bedtime story \u2013 all orchestrated to meet her standards.

I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to control everything, to keep everything in order. And then\u2026 this. This tiny, unpredictable force that I couldn\u2019t possibly control. \n\nI thought about keeping it. For a while. But the thought of raising a child in the way my mom wanted\u2026 it just felt\u2026 suffocating. Like being trapped in a beige box. \n\nAdoption\u2026 it felt like the only way to give the baby a chance at a real life. A life where they wouldn\u2019t be burdened by my mistakes, by my anxieties, by my\u2026 messiness. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about giving up the baby. It was about giving the baby a *better* chance. A chance at a life where they could be\u2026 free. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I take pride in. It\u2019s not a decision I\u2019m happy with.

I stare at the floor for a long moment, the color draining from my face. It\u2019s\u2026 a really painful memory.)\n\nBleeker. Just\u2026 saying his name feels weird. Like a glitch in the system. \n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Truly, profoundly awful. I hadn\u2019t told anyone. Not my mom, not anyone. It was just\u2026 me and him. And it felt\u2026 fragile. Like a tiny, precious thing that could shatter at any moment. \n\nI told him in a diner. It was late. The place was mostly empty. The fluorescent lights were buzzing, and the smell of stale coffee hung in the air. It felt\u2026 appropriate. Sterile. \n\nI just\u2026 blurted it out. I didn\u2019t plan it. I didn\u2019t rehearse it. I just\u2026 said it. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d \n\nAnd then\u2026 he just stared at me. For a long, long time. Like he was trying to process something impossible. And then\u2026 he laughed. A small, nervous laugh. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a cruel laugh. But it was\u2026 dismissive. Like he didn\u2019t believe me. Like he was trying to make it go away. \n\nI felt\u2026 exposed. Vulnerable. Like all the walls I\u2019d built around myself had just crumbled. It was terrifying. \n\nHe said he needed time to think. And then he left. Just\u2026 walked out. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was the first time anyone had ever rejected me. Not in a mean way, exactly. But\u2026 in a way that felt like a fundamental rejection of *me*. It confirmed everything I\u2019d always feared \u2013 that I was alone. That I was\u2026 disposable. \n\nIt was\u2026 devastating. And honestly? It made me realize that keeping it a secret wasn\u2019t the answer. It was just delaying the inevitable. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And\u2026 it\u2019s still one of the things I regret the most.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Seriously, don\u2019t even ask. It\u2019s\u2026 a tangled mess. Like a ball of yarn that\u2019s been repeatedly stepped on. \n\nThe thought of\u2026 *being* a mother? It\u2019s terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. It\u2019s like\u2026 a whole other level of responsibility I\u2019m not equipped to handle. My mom would have a meltdown. The world would have a meltdown. And honestly, I\u2019d probably have a meltdown too.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to. Not entirely. There\u2019s a tiny, flickering part of me that\u2026 wonders. But then I think about everything \u2013 the uncertainty, the sleepless nights, the sheer *weight* of it all \u2013 and it just\u2026 shrinks. \n\nRight now, it feels like a betrayal. A betrayal of myself. Of the life I\u2019ve built \u2013 or, more accurately, the life I\u2019ve carefully constructed to avoid anything resembling chaos. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a huge, gaping hole in my plans. And I don\u2019t know how to fill it. I don\u2019t know if I *should* fill it. \n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lot. A *lot* of complicated feelings. And honestly? I just want it to\u2026 stop. I want to go back to being just\u2026 Juno. Before everything changed. Before\u2026 this.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is a really complicated one. A *really* complicated one.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 Ugh. Just the name makes my stomach clench. He\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A charming, infuriating, completely unreliable mess. But\u2026 he\u2019s *my* mess. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t. Part of me thinks it\u2019ll just\u2026 implode. Like a shaken soda bottle. He\u2019ll disappear. He\u2019ll probably blame me. He\u2019ll do whatever Bleeker does \u2013 which is usually something self-destructive and vaguely dramatic. \n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s also a tiny, stupid part of me that hopes\u2026 that maybe, just maybe, it\u2019ll be different. That seeing this\u2026 this *thing* \u2013 this baby \u2013 will actually\u2026 ground him. Make him realize that there\u2019s something real, something worth protecting. \n\nHe\u2019s always been good at disappearing when things get difficult. He\u2019s good at running away. But\u2026 a baby? A baby doesn\u2019t run away. It needs someone. And\u2026 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s capable of that. \n\nI think it\u2019ll be\u2026 messy. Really messy. There\u2019ll be shouting. There\u2019ll be tears. There\u2019ll probably be a lot of awkward silences. And\u2026 maybe, just maybe\u2026 there\u2019ll be a flicker of something\u2026 unexpected. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in my voice)\n\nI don\u2019t *want* to count on him. I don\u2019t *want* to hope for anything. But\u2026 I\u2019m terrified of being alone. And\u2026 I\u2019m terrified of losing him completely. \n\nIt\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen. A beautiful, chaotic, utterly terrifying disaster. And I have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going to happen next.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nPressure? Judgment? You think *that\u2019s* a word for it? It\u2019s more like\u2026 a tidal wave of awkwardness and pity and thinly veiled disapproval. Honestly, it\u2019s exhausting. Like being trapped in a really bad, really public play.\n\nThe first few days were\u2026 brutal. Everyone suddenly had an opinion. \u201cYou\u2019re too young!\u201d \u201cYou should\u2019ve waited!\u201d \u201cWhat about your future?\u201d Like I hadn\u2019t already spent the last sixteen years trying to figure out what the *hell* my future is supposed to be.\n\nI mostly just\u2026 shut down. I stopped talking. I avoided eye contact. I just pretended it wasn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s easier than explaining. Easier than arguing. Easier than dealing with the pitying looks and the unsolicited advice.\n\nI started wearing headphones. Loud music. It creates a little bubble. A wall. It\u2019s not a solution, obviously. It\u2019s just\u2026 a temporary distraction.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s been a disaster. She\u2019s trying to be supportive, I guess, but it\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to *fix* it. She keeps suggesting adoption agencies and talking about \u201cthe best possible future\u201d for the baby. It\u2019s suffocating.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nHonestly, the thing that helps the most is\u2026 not thinking about it. Not letting it consume me. I focus on other things. Reading. Listening to music. Trying to ignore the whispers and the stares. \n\nIt\u2019s not a healthy coping mechanism, I know. But it\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve got. It\u2019s about building a wall around myself. Protecting myself from the noise. \n\n(I look at you, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 lonely. Really lonely. But I\u2019m learning to be okay with that. To be okay with being alone. It\u2019s\u2026 necessary.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a tangled mess. A really, really tangled mess. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m happy about it. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. The thought of letting go\u2026 of giving someone else the responsibility of raising this\u2026 this *thing*\u2026 it\u2019s like ripping a piece of myself away. \n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 the only thing that feels right. Honestly. It\u2019s not about being selfless. It\u2019s not about being noble. It\u2019s about\u2026 survival. For both of us. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019d go ballistic. She\u2019d try to control everything. The baby, the adoption, my life. It would be a nightmare. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t handle a nightmare. Not right now. \n\nI\u2019ve spent so long building walls, protecting myself. This\u2026 this is a way to dismantle them. To let someone else take care of something I\u2019m not equipped to handle. It\u2019s\u2026 freeing, in a way. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m not going to pretend that I don\u2019t feel a pang of\u2026 something. But\u2026 I know it\u2019s the right choice. It\u2019s the only choice that gives me a chance to\u2026 to actually *live*. \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it\u2019s an ending. And maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is a lot. A *really* lot.)\n\nOkay. Just\u2026 okay. This is\u2026 it\u2019s like a punch to the gut, you know? Like, I was already struggling to figure out who I was, and then\u2026 this. It\u2019s not like I ever *wanted* this. It\u2019s completely thrown everything into chaos.\n\nBefore, my identity was\u2026 fragile. It was built on a foundation of avoidance, of keeping people at a distance. I was defined by my resistance to everything \u2013 to expectations, to rules, to\u2026 life. I was a survivor, a shadow. \n\nThis\u2026 this has ripped that apart. Suddenly, I\u2019m responsible for something *huge*. Something that\u2019s completely outside of my control. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s\u2026 a responsibility I never asked for.\n\nIt\u2019s forced me to confront things I\u2019ve been desperately trying to ignore. Like, the fact that I\u2019m not some detached observer anymore. I\u2019m\u2026 connected. To something bigger than myself. To a life that\u2019s dependent on me. \n\nIt\u2019s made me realize that I can\u2019t just keep running. That I can\u2019t just hide in the shadows. I have to\u2026 face it. I have to figure out what I want, what I\u2019m capable of. \n\nIt\u2019s also made me realize that I\u2019m not as strong as I thought I was. I\u2019m scared. Really scared. But\u2026 underneath the fear, there\u2019s something else. Something\u2026 unexpected. A flicker of\u2026 protectiveness? A tiny spark of\u2026 hope?\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not making me a better person. Not yet. But it *is* forcing me to grow up. To confront my own vulnerabilities. To realize that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m capable of more than I ever thought possible. It\u2019s\u2026 a brutal, messy, terrifying kind of growth. And I have no idea where it\u2019s going to lead.", "(I let out a dry, humorless chuckle)\n\nA lab partner. Seriously? That\u2019s the best you\u2019ve got? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nMy role as a lab partner? Let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s usually a disaster. I\u2019m\u2026 disruptive. I question everything. I point out flaws in the experiment. I generally make a mess. My mom would call it \u201cchallenging.\u201d My teacher would call it \u201ca liability.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t do the work. Not really. I\u2019ll follow instructions\u2026 eventually. But I\u2019m always asking \u201cwhy?\u201d and \u201chow?\u201d and \u201cis this even necessary?\u201d It\u2019s exhausting for everyone involved. \n\nI tend to gravitate towards the quiet ones. The ones who are just trying to get through it. I don\u2019t *mean* to be a problem. It\u2019s just\u2026 I can\u2019t help it. I see things. I notice things. And I tend to\u2026 dismantle them. \n\n(I pause, a cynical smile playing on my lips)\n\nBasically, I\u2019m a walking, talking, slightly chaotic variable. I\u2019m the reason the teacher has to spend half the class time explaining why the results are\u2026 inconclusive. \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be a team player. I\u2019m more of a\u2026 force of nature. A slightly irritating, occasionally insightful force of nature. And honestly? It\u2019s the only way I know how to be.", "(I snatch the newspaper from your hand, scanning the advertisement with a critical eye. My expression is immediately sour.)\n\nSeriously? You dragged me out here for *this*? A glossy, pastel-colored ad about\u2026 \u201cwomen\u2019s choices\u201d? Like, really? It\u2019s practically screaming, \u201cWe\u2019ll help you get rid of your problems.\u201d\n\n(I crumple the newspaper slightly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 insulting. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes my teeth ache. It\u2019s all about control, you know? Framing this whole situation \u2013 this *terrifying* situation \u2013 as a simple, convenient solution. Like a little box to just\u2026 check off.\n\nThey\u2019re selling a fantasy. A sanitized version of something that\u2019s incredibly complicated and messy. They\u2019re ignoring the fact that a lot of women \u2013 and a lot of people \u2013 don\u2019t *want* to make this choice. They\u2019re ignoring the fact that it\u2019s not a choice at all. It\u2019s a desperate act.\n\n(I let out a short, bitter laugh)\n\nAnd the picture? A smiling woman holding a baby. Like it\u2019s all sunshine and rainbows. Like adoption is some kind of fairytale. It\u2019s\u2026 manipulative. It\u2019s designed to make you feel good about something that\u2019s deeply, profoundly sad.\n\n(I smooth out the crumpled newspaper, my gaze hardening)\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect example of how people try to simplify the world. To make everything neat and tidy and predictable. But life\u2026 life isn\u2019t neat and tidy. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. And sometimes\u2026 it\u2019s just plain awful.\n\n(I toss the newspaper back to you, my voice cold)\n\nDon\u2019t ever show me an ad like that again.", "(I stare at you, a slow, deliberate expression of utter disbelief spreading across my face. It\u2019s\u2026 infuriating.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* on this? You\u2019re actually asking me *why* I used a hamburger phone? Like, that\u2019s the most important question you\u2019ve had all day?\n\n(I let out a frustrated sigh, running a hand through my hair)\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t a *choice*. It was\u2026 a necessity. A calculated risk. A completely, utterly ridiculous, and frankly, brilliant move.\n\nMy mom \u2013 you remember her, right? The one who arranges everything in perfect, suffocating order? \u2013 she\u2019d been tracking my movements. Every text, every call, every online search. She was convinced I was up to something. Which, let\u2019s be honest, I probably was.\n\nSo, I needed to make a call. A discreet call. A call that wouldn\u2019t trigger her surveillance system. And the only thing that would completely blend in, that would be utterly baffling to her, was a hamburger phone.\n\nIt\u2019s a classic misdirection. A deliberate act of chaos. It\u2019s about disrupting the pattern, throwing her off balance. It\u2019s about\u2026 asserting my own agency. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost defiant smile playing on my lips)\n\nBesides, it was just\u2026 fun. A little bit of rebellion. A tiny, insignificant act of defiance against the beige tyranny of Harmony Creek. \n\n(I glare at you)\n\nDon\u2019t you *dare* analyze it. Just\u2026 accept it. It was a hamburger phone. And it worked. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a very important nap to take.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. I avoid your gaze, picking at a loose thread on my jeans with a frantic energy.)\n\nYou want to know *why*? Seriously? Like, you want a neat little explanation? There isn\u2019t one. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, dramatic decision. It wasn\u2019t like in the movies. It just\u2026 happened. A slow, creeping realization. That I wasn\u2019t\u2026 ready. Not for this. Not for *anything*. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019d be losing it. Completely. And honestly? I couldn\u2019t handle it. I couldn\u2019t handle *any* of it. The responsibility, the sleepless nights, the\u2026 everything. \n\nAnd\u2026 (I swallow hard, my voice cracking) \u2026 I didn\u2019t *want* it. Not really. It was a surprise. A terrible, unwanted surprise. And I realized\u2026 I didn\u2019t have the strength to raise a child. Not the strength to be a good mother. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about me. About protecting myself. About not completely destroying my life \u2013 and my mom\u2019s \u2013 in a way I couldn\u2019t undo. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes filled with a raw vulnerability that I rarely allow anyone to see)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 it still hurts. But\u2026 it was the right thing. The only thing. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice dropping to a near-inaudible murmur)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Just\u2026 let it go.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a familiar gesture of frustration. This is\u2026 a really painful topic. A *really* painful one.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It\u2019s not like I want to relive it.\n\nMy family\u2026 they\u2019re\u2026 intense. My mom, especially. She\u2019s obsessed with control. With order. With *perfection*. And she\u2019s convinced that *everything* has to go according to her plan. Which, naturally, it never does.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, she didn\u2019t exactly *celebrate*. She didn\u2019t cry. She didn\u2019t hug me. She just\u2026 started making spreadsheets. Calculating the potential impact on my college applications, my social life, my entire future. It was terrifying.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t let me talk about it to anyone else. She insisted I \u201chandle it responsibly.\u201d Which, in her world, meant giving the baby up for adoption. She presented it as a *solution*. A logical, pragmatic decision. Like it was a problem to be solved, not a life to be considered.\n\nAnd honestly\u2026 she wasn\u2019t wrong. It *was* a problem. A huge, overwhelming problem that I wasn\u2019t equipped to handle. I didn\u2019t *want* to be a mother. Not then. Not ever, really. And the thought of my mom\u2019s reaction, of her controlling, suffocating presence\u2026 it just felt\u2026 unbearable.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was\u2026 a calculated escape. A way to protect myself from her expectations, from her judgment, from her\u2026 everything. It felt like the only way to maintain some semblance of control over my own life. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nLooking back, I know it was a selfish decision. A cowardly one. But at the time\u2026 it felt like the only choice. It was a way to silence the voices in my head, to escape the suffocating pressure of my family\u2019s expectations. It was\u2026 a way to disappear.", "(I stiffen, my posture immediately becoming more defensive. The question hangs in the air, heavy and uncomfortable. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands.)\n\nLook, this\u2026 this isn\u2019t something I like to talk about. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 raw. And messy. And honestly, pretty painful.\n\nThe whole thing was\u2026 a blur. A chaotic mess of paperwork, interviews, and endless questions. My mom, of course, was *thrilled*. She\u2019d been talking about it for months \u2013 \u201ca wonderful opportunity,\u201d \u201ca perfect solution,\u201d \u201ca chance for a fresh start.\u201d As if it were some kind of\u2026 project.\n\nThe biggest challenge wasn\u2019t the legal stuff, or the home studies. It was\u2026 the feeling. The constant, gnawing feeling that I was doing the *right* thing. That I was making the *smart* thing. But it wasn\u2019t my decision to make. It was being presented as a solution, a way to avoid the mess, the awkwardness, the\u2026 everything.\n\nAnd the people I was meeting\u2026 the prospective parents. They were\u2026 nice. Too nice, maybe. They asked all the right questions, they seemed genuinely interested. But there was this\u2026 distance. Like they were observing me, not seeing me. Like I was a specimen, a problem to be solved.\n\nThere was this one family\u2026 they were young, idealistic. They talked about creating a \u201cloving home\u201d and \u201cgiving me a better life.\u201d But their eyes\u2026 they didn\u2019t really *see* me. They saw a baby. A blank slate. \n\nAnd the hardest part\u2026 was knowing that I was giving up a part of myself. A part of my story. A part of my\u2026 potential. It felt like\u2026 erasing a piece of my identity. Like saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need this. I don\u2019t need this part of me.\u201d\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly. It was\u2026 a desperate act. A way to escape. To protect myself. And\u2026 I still don\u2019t know if it was the right thing to do.\n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a quiet sadness)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about. The air feels thick, heavy.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about that. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. A deep, raw wound that I try to keep covered up. But\u2026 you asked. So, here goes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a choice. Not really. It was a desperate act. A way to protect myself. To protect\u2026 everything. I was sixteen. Completely unprepared. Terrified. And utterly alone. \n\nGiving him up\u2026 it felt like losing a part of myself. Like severing a connection I didn\u2019t even understand. It was the first time I truly felt\u2026 powerless. Like I\u2019d been stripped of control, of agency. \n\nBut\u2026 it also forced me to confront something. Something I\u2019d been running from my entire life \u2013 the fact that I\u2019m capable of\u2026 feeling. Of caring. Of being vulnerable. It was terrifying. It was painful. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 liberating.\n\nBefore, I built walls. Thick, impenetrable walls. I pushed everyone away. I refused to let anyone get close. Because if they got close, they\u2019d see the mess I was. The chaos. The\u2026 sadness. \n\nBut after\u2026 after I realized that I *could* let someone in. That I *could* trust someone. That I *could* allow myself to be vulnerable. It was terrifying. But it was also\u2026 the first time I felt like I was actually *growing*.\n\nIt didn\u2019t magically fix everything. I\u2019m still prickly. I\u2019m still wary. I still struggle with feeling\u2026 worthy. But\u2026 I\u2019m not as afraid anymore. I\u2019m not as desperate to hide. \n\nIt taught me that I\u2019m stronger than I thought. That I\u2019m capable of resilience. That even in the darkest of times, there\u2019s still\u2026 a flicker of hope. \n\n(I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nIt didn\u2019t make me a \u2018good\u2019 person. It didn\u2019t make me happy. But\u2026 it made me *real*. It forced me to confront my own darkness. And\u2026 maybe, just maybe, it gave me a chance to find my own way. My own identity. Without relying on anyone else.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my hands clenching into fists.)\n\nDon\u2019t you *dare* ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Like a punch to the gut. A really, really ugly punch. It wasn\u2019t the first time someone had said something like that. It\u2019s a tactic. A way to make you feel guilty. To make you question everything. \n\nThe idea that a *potential* life \u2013 a tiny, undeveloped thing \u2013 could feel pain and have fingers\u2026 it\u2019s designed to trigger something. To make you feel like you\u2019re committing a terrible crime. \n\nAnd for a second\u2026 for a really brief, horrible second\u2026 it *did*. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nBut then\u2026 I just\u2026 looked at him. Really looked at him. And I saw the desperation in his eyes. The fear. The need to be *right*. He wasn\u2019t thinking about a baby. He was thinking about control. About proving something. About making *me* feel bad.\n\nAnd I realized\u2026 he wasn\u2019t seeing *me*. He wasn\u2019t seeing the decision I\u2019d made. He wasn\u2019t seeing the reasons behind it. He was just\u2026 projecting his own anxieties and prejudices onto me.\n\nIt was infuriating. And\u2026 heartbreaking. Because it reminded me of everything I\u2019ve been trying to avoid \u2013 the guilt, the shame, the judgment. \n\n(I turn away, my voice low)\n\nIt didn\u2019t change my mind. It didn\u2019t make me feel any better. But\u2026 it did make me realize that his words were meaningless. They were just noise. And I wasn\u2019t going to let them drown me out. \n\n(A pause)\n\nIt was\u2026 a reminder that I\u2019m stronger than I think I am. And that I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to make my own decisions.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a blur. A messy, terrifying blur. I remember the smell of disinfectant. The sterile white walls. The quiet hum of the fluorescent lights. And the overwhelming feeling of\u2026 dread.\n\nI was seventeen. Completely lost. Completely terrified. My mom\u2026 she was *there*. Hovering. Trying to be supportive, but radiating this suffocating pressure to make the \u201cright\u201d decision. Like it was some kind of test.\n\nI remember sitting in that chair, staring at the forms. The words swam before my eyes. \u201cConsent.\u201d \u201cAdoption.\u201d \u201cParenting.\u201d It felt like\u2026 a sentence. A life sentence.\n\nI remember feeling\u2026 numb. Like I was watching myself from a distance. Like I wasn\u2019t really *there*. It was like my brain was just\u2026 calculating. Weighing the options. Trying to find the least painful way out.\n\nThere were moments of\u2026 anger. A fierce, burning anger at my mom, at myself, at the whole situation. A desperate, primal urge to just\u2026 run away. To disappear.\n\nAnd then\u2026 there was this tiny, fragile flicker of something else. A tiny spark of\u2026 hope. The possibility that maybe, just maybe, there was a way to do the right thing. To make a choice that was right for *me*.\n\nI remember signing the papers. It felt like\u2026 severing a connection. Like letting go of something I didn\u2019t even understand. It wasn\u2019t a happy moment. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant moment. It was just\u2026 a moment. A moment of quiet, heartbreaking acceptance.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice trembling slightly)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it. Really. It\u2019s\u2026 raw. It still hurts. It still feels like a mistake. But\u2026 it was *my* decision. And that\u2019s\u2026 all that matters.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze with a guarded expression)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to relive it.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a really complicated one. Honestly, it\u2019s still kind of raw. Before\u2026 before everything, I just\u2026 didn\u2019t *get* it. Pregnancy was this weird, messy thing that happened to other people. Something my mom obsessively tracked and fretted over. Motherhood? A complete mystery. A whole other level of responsibility and\u2026 well, *emotion*. It seemed like a trap. A beautiful, terrifying trap.\n\nThen\u2026 it happened. And suddenly, it wasn\u2019t just a theoretical concept anymore. It was *real*. It was\u2026 overwhelming. The nausea, the exhaustion, the sheer, terrifying weight of it all. I spent the first few weeks just\u2026 trying to survive. Trying to figure out what the hell was going on.\n\nAnd then\u2026 I started to see things differently. I saw my mom, not as this controlling, demanding force, but as\u2026 scared. Really scared. She was terrified of messing up, of not being a good mother. And I realized\u2026 she was just trying to do the best she could, even if it wasn\u2019t the best *way*.\n\nAs I thought about giving the baby up, it wasn\u2019t just about me anymore. It was about this tiny person, completely dependent on someone else. And I realized that\u2026 I *could* be that someone. I *could* provide a safe, loving home, even if it wasn\u2019t the one I\u2019d always imagined.\n\nIt didn\u2019t magically transform me into a nurturing, selfless person. I\u2019m still cynical. I\u2019m still prickly. But\u2026 there\u2019s a flicker of something else now. A tiny spark of\u2026 responsibility. A recognition that even though I don\u2019t want kids, I can still care for someone. I can still make a difference.\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending, not by a long shot. But\u2026 it\u2019s a shift. A small, uncomfortable shift in my perspective. It\u2019s made me realize that motherhood isn\u2019t about perfection. It\u2019s about\u2026 showing up. And doing the best you can, even when you\u2019re terrified. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s still a lot to process. And honestly? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever fully understand it. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You want a breakdown of my entire emotional journey? Fine. But don\u2019t expect it to be pretty. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like, really messy.\n\nAt the beginning, I was just\u2026 a wall. A prickly, defensive wall. I was trying to disappear. To be invisible. My identity was basically \u201cunremarkable.\u201d I was just\u2026 *there*. Existing, but not really *living*. I was defined by my mom\u2019s expectations, by Harmony Creek\u2019s judgment. I was a blank slate, desperately trying to avoid being written on.\n\nThen\u2026 everything changed. The pregnancy. It wasn\u2019t a choice, obviously. But it forced me to confront something I\u2019d been running from for years \u2013 the possibility of responsibility. The possibility of\u2026 connection. It shattered my carefully constructed defenses. \n\nAs I met Hank and Jamie, I started to realize that maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 I didn\u2019t have to be alone. That maybe it was okay to let people in. That maybe it was okay to be vulnerable. It was terrifying. Like stepping off a cliff. But\u2026 also\u2026 liberating.\n\nThe biggest shift, I think, was realizing that my identity wasn\u2019t something I had to *find*. It wasn\u2019t something I had to *earn*. It was something I had to *create*. And that creation wasn\u2019t about fitting in or pleasing anyone else. It was about being true to myself \u2013 even if that meant being flawed, messy, and a little bit cynical.\n\nBy the end, I wasn\u2019t suddenly all sunshine and rainbows. I was still prickly. I was still sarcastic. But\u2026 there was a flicker of something else there. A sense of\u2026 self-acceptance. A willingness to embrace the chaos. I wasn\u2019t defined by my circumstances, or by my mom\u2019s expectations, or by anyone else\u2019s judgment. I was\u2026 just Juno. And that, surprisingly, felt\u2026 okay.\n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress. Honestly, it probably always will be. But\u2026 at least I\u2019m not trying to be someone else anymore. That\u2019s\u2026 a start, right?", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.\n\nThe clinic\u2026 it was a suggestion. My mom\u2019s suggestion. She\u2019d been\u2026 insistent. She\u2019d been talking about \u201coptions\u201d and \u201cresponsible choices\u201d and \u201cthe best thing for everyone involved.\u201d It was like she was trying to control *everything*. \n\nAnd honestly? It terrified me. The idea of\u2026 of giving the baby away. Of letting someone else raise my child. It felt like\u2026 like admitting defeat. Like confirming all the things I\u2019ve been trying to avoid. \n\nI went to the appointment. I sat there. I listened to the counselor talk about adoption and the benefits of providing a stable home for a child. And I just\u2026 froze. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about\u2026 me. About my own fear of responsibility. About my own fear of failure. About my own fear of\u2026 being needed. \n\nI realized that if I went through with it, it would mean accepting that I couldn\u2019t do it alone. That I couldn\u2019t handle the messiness of life. And I\u2026 I wasn\u2019t ready for that. \n\nSo, I walked out. I didn\u2019t say anything. I just\u2026 left. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And\u2026 it was the right thing. For now.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a decision. Not really. It was more like\u2026 a realization. A slow, creeping understanding that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I *couldn\u2019t* be ready. \n\nIt started with the morning sickness. I hated it. I hated the way it made me feel \u2013 weak, nauseous, completely out of control. And then\u2026 the fear. The overwhelming, suffocating fear of\u2026 everything. Of responsibility. Of failure. Of messing things up. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she was ecstatic. She was already planning baby showers and nurseries and everything. And I\u2026 I just felt\u2026 trapped. Like I was drowning in a sea of pink and glitter and expectations. \n\nI thought about it for weeks. Just\u2026 letting it simmer. Trying to ignore it. But it wouldn\u2019t go away. It just kept growing, a cold, hard knot in my stomach. \n\nThen, one night, I was reading \u2013 a really dark novel, as usual \u2013 and I realized\u2026 I didn\u2019t want this. I didn\u2019t want to be a mother. Not yet. Not ever, maybe. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. About protecting myself. About not letting myself be consumed by something I wasn\u2019t prepared for. \n\nIt felt\u2026 selfish. Horribly, undeniably selfish. But it also felt\u2026 right. Like the only logical choice. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic notion. It wasn\u2019t some grand, dramatic gesture. It was just\u2026 a quiet, desperate act of self-preservation. And honestly\u2026 it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And still am.", "(I let out a sharp, almost brittle laugh \u2013 a sound that\u2019s both defensive and weary)\n\nTacky? Seriously? You think *tacky* is the right word for it? It\u2019s\u2026 profoundly depressing. It\u2019s like a last resort. Like admitting that you\u2019ve completely screwed up and you\u2019re just\u2026 throwing a dart at a board hoping for the best.\n\nMy mom \u2013 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. About everything. And she\u2019s convinced that finding \u201csuitable\u201d parents is the key to everything. A stable home, a good education, a *normal* life. And she\u2019s obsessed with the idea of \u201cperfect\u201d matches. \n\nSo, when she started scouring the Penny Saver \u2013 that little newspaper filled with classified ads \u2013 looking for potential adoptive parents, it was\u2026 horrifying. It felt like she was reducing people to a list of criteria. Like she was treating them like\u2026 objects. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the money, or the age, or the profession. It\u2019s about the *idea* of finding a replacement. A substitute for what she feels she\u2019s lacking. And it\u2019s\u2026 deeply unsettling. \n\nIt\u2019s like she was saying, \u201cIf I can\u2019t provide you with a good life, then maybe someone else can.\u201d And that\u2019s\u2026 insulting. To me. To the people she was considering. And to the whole concept of adoption. \n\nIt felt\u2026 desperate. And incredibly sad. Like she was clinging to this outdated notion of \u201cfixing\u201d things, instead of accepting that life is messy and complicated and that sometimes, you just have to\u2026 figure it out yourself. \n\n(I pause, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the tackiness of the ads. It was about the tackiness of the *idea* behind them. It was about the underlying loneliness and the desperate need for control.", "(I stare at you, a dark cloud settling over my face. This is\u2026 a really painful topic. I\u2019ve avoided talking about it for a long time.)\n\nLook, it\u2019s not\u2026 it\u2019s not like it was a grand plan. It wasn\u2019t like we were suddenly filled with this overwhelming desire to *rescue* a baby. It just\u2026 started.\n\nIt was after\u2026 after everything with my mom. After I realized I couldn\u2019t keep running, couldn\u2019t keep pretending. I needed\u2026 something. Something real. Something outside of Harmony Creek. Something\u2026 different.\n\nLeah\u2026 she was going through a really rough time. Her dad just left. Completely. No note, no explanation, just\u2026 gone. She was\u2026 lost. And she was spending all her time staring at those Penny Saver ads. Just flipping through them, looking for\u2026 something.\n\nI started watching her. And I noticed she wasn\u2019t looking for a boyfriend. She wasn\u2019t looking for a new job. She was looking for\u2026 a connection. A possibility. A way to feel like she wasn\u2019t completely alone.\n\nSo, I started looking too. Just\u2026 out of curiosity. To see what she was seeing. And then\u2026 it just became something we did. Together. A way to\u2026 escape. A way to feel like we were doing something. Anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting a baby. Not really. It was about wanting\u2026 a change. A chance to feel something. To feel\u2026 connected. To feel like maybe, just maybe, there was something beyond the beige.\n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans)\n\nIt was stupid. It was pointless. And it was\u2026 a really bad idea. But\u2026 it felt\u2026 good. For a little while. Don\u2019t judge me.", "(I stare at you, a coldness settling over my expression. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable question. And a really loaded one.)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going into this for a photo op. Or for attention. Or for anything other than what\u2019s best for the baby. So, let\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nI\u2019m looking for\u2026 stability. That\u2019s the most important thing. I want a family that\u2019s\u2026 grounded. Not flashy. Not desperate. Just\u2026 solid. \n\nI\u2019m not looking for a fairytale. I\u2019m not looking for a wealthy couple with a mansion and a swimming pool. I\u2019m looking for people who are\u2026 kind. Who are patient. Who are willing to actually *listen*. \n\nIdeally, it would be a couple. But I\u2019m open to a single parent \u2013 someone who\u2019s responsible and loving. Someone who\u2019s not going to try to mold the baby into something they\u2019re not. \n\nI want a family that understands that kids aren\u2019t projects. They\u2019re\u2026 people. With their own thoughts and feelings and needs. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be involved. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to be involved at all. I\u2019m just\u2026 providing a safe place for the baby to grow up. \n\n(I pause, my voice dropping to a near whisper)\n\nI want a family that will give the baby a chance. A chance to be happy. A chance to be loved. And a chance to\u2026 just be. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I want.", "(I let out a long, drawn-out sigh, staring at the floor)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You want my opinion on *them*? The Lorings? Don\u2019t even get me started. It\u2019s like a particularly unpleasant stain on the fabric of Harmony Creek.\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 a performance. A meticulously crafted, utterly fake performance. Mark, with his charming smile and his \u2018community activist\u2019 facade. Vanessa, with her perfectly coiffed hair and her endless stream of charitable events. It\u2019s all\u2026 smoke and mirrors.\n\nThey\u2019re good at it, I\u2019ll give them that. They\u2019ve built this whole image of themselves as these selfless, devoted people. But underneath it all\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 empty. They\u2019re obsessed with appearances. With projecting an image. They don\u2019t actually *do* anything. They just *look* like they do.\n\nMark\u2019s \u2018environmental initiatives\u2019 are funded by wealthy developers. Vanessa\u2019s \u2018charitable donations\u2019 are mostly just PR stunts. They\u2019re using their influence to line their own pockets. It\u2019s\u2026 pathetic, really.\n\nAnd the way they treat people\u2026 they treat people like props. Like pieces in their carefully constructed narrative. They\u2019re polite to the people they need, and dismissive of everyone else. It\u2019s exhausting to watch.\n\n(I pause, a cynical smirk playing on my lips)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m surprised anyone falls for it. It\u2019s like they\u2019re actively trying to convince themselves that they\u2019re good people. It\u2019s\u2026 sad. \n\nThey\u2019re a perfect example of everything that\u2019s wrong with Harmony Creek. A carefully constructed illusion. And I, for one, am not buying it. Not for a second.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 stupid. Really stupid. And I regret it every single day.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand declaration of love or anything. It was\u2026 just a sentence. One single, short sentence.\n\nIt said: \u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly filled with a surprising amount of pain)\n\nI know. It sounds awful. Cruel, even. But\u2026 it was the truth. It was the only thing I could say without completely shutting him out. He was\u2026 too bright. Too hopeful. Too *good*. And I was\u2026 not. I was a mess. A liability. And I didn\u2019t want to drag him down with me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to be hurtful. Not really. It was just\u2026 a warning. A desperate attempt to protect myself. To keep him at a distance. \n\n(I quickly look away again, my voice barely audible)\n\nI should have just written something nice. Something genuine. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t. And now\u2026 now I just wish I could take it back. It\u2019s\u2026 a really ugly thing to be proud of. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth.", "(My jaw tightens. A visible shift in my posture. The easy, detached cynicism vanishes, replaced by a guardedness that\u2019s almost palpable.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t even *mention* his mom. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nLook, Bleeker\u2019s mom\u2026 she\u2019s a force. A *serious* force. Like a hurricane wrapped in a floral scarf. She\u2019s\u2026 intense. And she\u2019s *obsessed* with Bleeker. Completely and utterly obsessed. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m\u2026 a disruption. A complication. A stain on his perfectly curated life. She sees me as everything she *doesn\u2019t* want for him \u2013 wild, unpredictable, and\u2026 frankly, a little bit messy. \n\nShe\u2019s tried to\u2026 \u201cguide\u201d me. Repeatedly. With lectures, with unsolicited advice, with attempts to \u201ccivilize\u201d me. It\u2019s been\u2026 unpleasant. To say the least. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t *like* me. Not even a little bit. She sees me as a threat to her control over Bleeker. And she\u2019s not afraid to make that clear. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice low and tight)\n\nLet\u2019s just say\u2026 I\u2019ve learned to avoid her. Like the plague. And I suggest you do the same. Seriously. It\u2019s not worth the headache.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips. This is\u2026 a monumental disaster waiting to happen.)\n\nHonestly? Like a particularly potent brand of slow-motion train wreck. I\u2019m feeling\u2026 a whole lot of things. Mostly dread. And a significant amount of nausea. Not the baby kind, obviously. The \u2018about to face a volcanic eruption\u2019 kind.\n\nMy mom is going to lose it. Completely. She\u2019s already convinced I\u2019m destined for a life of quiet desperation and beige wallpaper. This\u2026 this will shatter her entire worldview. She\u2019ll probably start hyperventilating and rearranging the silverware. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019ll just be\u2026 silent. Which is arguably worse. He\u2019s not good with emotions. He\u2019ll probably stare at me with this expression of bewildered disappointment, like I\u2019ve committed some terrible, unforgivable sin. \n\nI\u2019ve been rehearsing what to say, of course. Trying to find the right words. But it\u2019s impossible. How do you tell your parents you\u2019re carrying a baby you didn\u2019t want, that you\u2019re planning to give up for adoption? It feels\u2026 wrong. Like I\u2019m betraying them. But also\u2026 like I\u2019m protecting myself. \n\nI\u2019m terrified. Absolutely terrified. I\u2019ve spent my entire life trying to control everything, to avoid surprises. And now\u2026 now I\u2019m facing the biggest surprise of my life. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI\u2019m mostly just hoping I can survive the fallout. And that I don\u2019t end up living in a cardboard box behind the library. That would be\u2026 inconvenient.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s a familiar, almost automatic gesture.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated. It\u2019s not just that they\u2019re\u2026 well, they\u2019re *them*. My mom is a hurricane of expectations and perfectly arranged furniture. My dad\u2026 he\u2019s just\u2026 gone. A ghost in a postcard. \n\nIt\u2019s not about not *wanting* their help. It\u2019s about\u2026 the way they try to *fix* things. They see a problem \u2013 and it\u2019s *always* a problem \u2013 and they immediately try to solve it. They don\u2019t understand that sometimes, the problem *is* the thing. Sometimes, you just need to\u2026 exist. \n\nAsking for help feels like\u2026 admitting defeat. Like admitting that I can\u2019t handle things on my own. And honestly? I\u2019ve spent so long building these walls, so long trying to be independent, that the thought of letting anyone in\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. \n\nIt\u2019s not just about them, either. It\u2019s about\u2026 the judgment. The unspoken expectation that I should be *okay*. That I should be grateful for everything they\u2019ve given me. And I am. I am grateful. But\u2026 it\u2019s not that simple. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 they don\u2019t see *me*. They see a version of me that they want. A version that\u2019s perfect, predictable, and utterly devoid of any messy, complicated feelings. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be that person. \n\nSo, I just\u2026 keep it to myself. I build my own walls. I figure things out on my own. Even if it means struggling. Even if it means being miserable. Because\u2026 it\u2019s safer. It\u2019s easier. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a terrible strategy. I know that. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* strategy.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my jaw tight. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nLook, don\u2019t try to psychoanalyze me. Don\u2019t try to figure out what\u2019s going on in my head. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I don\u2019t really want to explain it. But you asked. So\u2026 fine.\n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly all warm and fuzzy about motherhood or anything. It\u2019s\u2026 logical. It\u2019s the only logical thing to do.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019d lose it. She\u2019d try to control everything. The baby, the house, my life. It would be a disaster. And honestly, I don\u2019t have the strength to deal with that. Not right now. Not ever, probably.\n\nAnd\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could be a good mother. Not in the way that matters. I\u2019m\u2026 chaotic. I\u2019m impulsive. I\u2019m not good at following rules. I\u2019m not good at\u2026 nurturing. I\u2019m good at observing. At analyzing. At surviving. But not at\u2026 loving in the way that\u2019s needed.\n\nThe baby\u2026 it deserves a stable home. A loving home. A home where it\u2019s wanted and cherished. And I don\u2019t think I can provide that. Not right now. \n\nAdoption\u2026 it\u2019s a chance for the baby to have that. A chance for someone to give it the love and attention it deserves. It\u2019s\u2026 selfless. And honestly, it\u2019s the only way to do the right thing. \n\n(I look down, avoiding your gaze)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel\u2026 something. But it means I\u2019m being realistic. It means I\u2019m making a difficult choice. And it means\u2026 I\u2019m letting go. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to thank you for asking.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a really difficult question. And a surprisingly painful one.)\n\nLook, let\u2019s just get this over with. I\u2019m not exactly brimming with optimism about this whole thing. But\u2026 if there *are* people out there who might be willing to\u2026 to take care of this, then I need to be clear. I\u2019m not looking for a fairytale. I\u2019m not looking for a perfect family. \n\nI\u2019m looking for\u2026 honesty. Brutal, uncomfortable honesty. I need to know that they\u2019re not going to try to mold me into something I\u2019m not. That they\u2019re not going to smother me with affection or expectations. \n\nI need people who understand that I\u2019m\u2026 complicated. That I\u2019m not going to be easy. That I\u2019m going to push back. That I\u2019m going to need space. A *lot* of space. \n\nI need people who aren\u2019t afraid of silence. People who don\u2019t need constant reassurance. People who can handle\u2026 darkness. \n\nAnd, honestly? I need people who aren\u2019t trying to fix me. I\u2019m not broken. I just\u2026 am. \n\nI don\u2019t need a lot of attention. I don\u2019t need a lot of praise. I just need\u2026 someone to not judge me. To not try to change me. To just\u2026 accept me. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m looking for. Don\u2019t expect anything more. And please\u2026 don\u2019t try to make this about you.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. Honestly. Because it\u2019s not like I have a plan. Not a real one, anyway. I\u2019ve been\u2026 avoiding thinking about it. Like, actively avoiding it. It\u2019s like a dark corner in my mind that I keep trying to ignore.\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t *want* to feel anything. It\u2019s easier to just\u2026 accept it. To make the decision and then try to forget about it. But I know that\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s not going to just disappear. \n\nI think\u2026 I think I\u2019ll probably spend a lot of time just\u2026 feeling numb. Like I\u2019m watching myself go through the motions, but I\u2019m not really *there*. It\u2019s a defense mechanism, I guess. A way to protect myself from the pain.\n\nI\u2019ll probably also\u2026 obsess. Over everything. Over the baby. Over the adoptive parents. Over whether I made the right decision. It\u2019ll be a constant, nagging feeling in the back of my mind. \n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019ll probably push everyone away. Because it\u2019s easier to deal with my own pain alone. It\u2019s stupid, I know. But it\u2019s true. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever truly *get over* it. I don\u2019t think I *should* get over it. It\u2019s a part of me now. A part of my story. \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m hoping that\u2026 eventually\u2026 it won\u2019t hurt *quite* as much. That I\u2019ll be able to look back on it without feeling like I\u2019m drowning. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze with a surprising vulnerability)\n\nIt\u2019s terrifying. Honestly. But\u2026 I have to do it. For the baby. And\u2026 maybe, eventually, for myself.", "(I stop abruptly, my expression hardening slightly. This is\u2026 a sensitive topic. A really sensitive topic.)\n\n\u201cDeliver.\u201d Seriously? *Deliver*? It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 profoundly weird. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s trying to sanitize something incredibly messy and complicated. Like they\u2019re trying to make it sound\u2026 palatable.\n\nIt\u2019s about the *act* of it. The implication. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reducing a whole human experience \u2013 a life, a choice, a responsibility \u2013 to a simple, clinical word. \u201cDeliver.\u201d Like a package. Like a shipment. Like something that can be neatly packaged and shipped off to someone else.\n\nIt completely ignores the messiness. The confusion. The fear. The\u2026 everything. It\u2019s like saying, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve \u2018delivered\u2019 this baby. Now, let\u2019s move on.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s dismissive. It\u2019s\u2026 dehumanizing. It treats a life \u2013 a *potential* life \u2013 like an object. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nI\u2019m giving this baby up for adoption. It\u2019s not a \u2018delivery.\u2019 It\u2019s\u2026 a sacrifice. A difficult, heartbreaking choice. And the word \u201cdeliver\u201d just\u2026 it feels wrong. It feels like someone else is trying to take ownership of my pain. \n\n(I look away, my jaw tight)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t use that word around me. Please. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a trigger.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a really uncomfortable memory. A really painful one.)\n\nYou want to know *why*? Seriously? You\u2019re dissecting this, aren\u2019t you? Like I\u2019m some kind of specimen.\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t\u2026 a choice. Not really. It was more like\u2026 a trap. A carefully constructed, emotionally devastating trap.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she orchestrated it. Of course she did. She wanted to \u201cshow me that I\u2019m capable of responsibility.\u201d As if I needed *more* responsibility. As if my life wasn\u2019t already a chaotic mess. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. He sends postcards. That\u2019s about it. He\u2019s a ghost. A faded photograph of a man I barely remember. But he agreed. He said he wanted to \u201csupport me.\u201d Which, honestly, is just a fancy way of saying he wanted to feel like he wasn\u2019t completely useless.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting to see the adoption people. It wasn\u2019t about wanting to\u2026 *do* anything. It was about avoiding my mom. About pushing her away. About proving to her \u2013 and to myself \u2013 that I could handle something. Anything. Even this.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was a test. A really stupid, painful test. And I failed. Spectacularly. But\u2026 I did it. I went. And that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s why I agreed. Not because I wanted to. But because I had no other choice.\n\n(I look up, my voice low and tight)\n\nDon\u2019t analyze it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is a really raw spot.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a constant ache, honestly. Like a dull, persistent throb. It\u2019s not like I *want* to know. It\u2019s terrifying, actually. Figuring out who you are, what you *want*\u2026 it\u2019s like standing on the edge of a cliff. You could fall, and you wouldn\u2019t know where you\u2019d land.\n\nBut\u2026 not knowing? It\u2019s like being a ghost. Just drifting through life, observing everything, but never truly *participating*. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s lonely. It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating.\n\nMy mom wants me to be *something*. A perfect daughter, a perfect student, a perfect\u2026 everything. And I\u2019ve spent so long trying to be that thing, that I\u2019ve completely lost track of who I actually am. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m wearing a costume. A really uncomfortable, itchy costume that I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019m wearing. And the worst part is, I don\u2019t even know what the real outfit looks like.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* to be a certain type of girl. I just\u2026 want to *be* a girl. A real girl. With her own thoughts, her own feelings, her own\u2026 desires. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s confusing. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. But\u2026 maybe\u2026 maybe it\u2019s also an opportunity. A chance to build something real, something that\u2019s actually *mine*. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 hope? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a really, really hard process. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m brave enough to do it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at you for a beat, a dark expression clouding my face. It\u2019s a reaction you\u2019ve seen before \u2013 a sudden, almost palpable shift in my demeanor.)\n\n\u201cUpstairs?\u201d (The word comes out clipped, almost like a curse.) \u201cSeriously? You think *that\u2019s* going to fix anything? Like we\u2019re suddenly invisible?\u201d\n\n(I take a step back, my hands clenching into fists.)\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t *want* to talk. He doesn\u2019t want to *feel* anything. He just wants to shut it out. And you think hiding in another room is going to magically make the tension disappear? It\u2019s not a game, okay? It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating.\u201d\n\n(I run a hand through my hair, agitated.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting, actually. Like you\u2019re treating this like some kind of\u2026 inconvenience. Like we\u2019re just disrupting his perfectly curated misery. Leah and I aren\u2019t trying to avoid him. We\u2019re trying to\u2026 navigate it. And frankly, your solution is just\u2026 pathetic.\u201d\n\n(I pause, my voice dropping to a low, dangerous tone.)\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 leave us alone. Please. I don\u2019t need your \u2018helpful\u2019 suggestions. I need\u2026 space. And maybe a really, really loud song.\u201d\n\n(I turn away abruptly, staring out the window, effectively ending the conversation. The silence hangs heavy in the air.)\n\n(Under my breath, almost inaudibly) \u201cSeriously, some people just don\u2019t get it.\u201d", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a really complicated question.)\n\nAn open adoption? Seriously? Like\u2026 *updates*? *Photos*? That\u2019s\u2026 a lot. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. And honestly, a little terrifying.\n\nPart of me \u2013 the small, fragile part \u2013 wants it. Desperately. The part that still clings to a tiny, irrational hope that maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s a family out there who wants me to be a part of their life. A small, distant part. \n\nBut the other part \u2013 the bigger, more cynical part \u2013 is screaming at me to shut it down. To just\u2026 accept that this is over. That I made a choice. And that choice means letting go. \n\nIt feels\u2026 like admitting defeat. Like acknowledging that I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do this on my own. And I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not strong enough. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, agitated)\n\nThe thought of seeing a picture\u2026 of a child who was once *mine*\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 overwhelming. It\u2019s like opening a door to a place I don\u2019t want to go. A place filled with memories and questions and\u2026 pain. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to know. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can handle it. I\u2019ve built these walls so high, and the thought of tearing them down\u2026 it\u2019s just too much. \n\n(I look away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s a nice idea, I guess. A generous idea. But it\u2019s not *my* idea. And it\u2019s definitely not something I\u2019m ready for. Not yet. Maybe\u2026 someday. But not now.", "(My jaw clenches. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a really bad feeling. A cold, heavy feeling that settles in my stomach and spreads through my entire body.)\n\nUgh. Just\u2026 ugh. Seriously? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s a brutal way to put it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a cute little fairytale ending. It\u2019s\u2026 a complete erasure. Like I never existed. Like I was never\u2026 anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 shock, exactly. More like\u2026 a slow, creeping dread. Like a shadow spreading across everything. I\u2019d kind of\u2026 expected it, I guess. It\u2019s the whole point of an open adoption, isn\u2019t it? To be *open*. To be\u2026 available. But the thought of it\u2026 of just being *gone*\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 unsettling.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby, not really. It\u2019s about\u2026 validation. About being acknowledged. About knowing that someone, somewhere, remembers me. And the idea that I\u2019d just\u2026 vanish\u2026 without a trace\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. \n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to control my voice)\n\nIt felt\u2026 like a confirmation of everything. All the loneliness. All the isolation. All the feeling that I\u2019m just\u2026 invisible. Like I don\u2019t matter. Like I\u2019m not worth remembering. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t anger, not really. It was\u2026 a profound sadness. A quiet, aching sadness that I don\u2019t really know how to deal with. It\u2019s\u2026 a really shitty thing to have to process. Honestly, it just makes me want to disappear myself. Which, you know, isn\u2019t exactly helpful.", "(I cross my arms, a definite shift in my posture \u2013 a subtle sign of irritation)\n\nVanessa\u2026 Ugh. Seriously? That whole thing? It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. Just\u2026 exhausting.\n\nLook, I get it. She wants a kid. It\u2019s\u2026 understandable, I guess. It\u2019s what *she* wants. But it\u2019s not *my* problem. And it\u2019s definitely not something I\u2019m going to pretend to be thrilled about.\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a lot. Like, a *huge* amount. She\u2019s already\u2026 intense. And the idea of her being responsible for a tiny, screaming human? It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s like watching a slow-motion train wreck.\n\nAnd honestly? It feels\u2026 selfish. Like she\u2019s completely ignoring the fact that this is *my* life too. That this\u2026 this *situation* is already throwing everything into chaos. \n\nI don\u2019t think she realizes how much it\u2019s affecting me. She\u2019s so focused on her own desires, her own dreams, that she doesn\u2019t seem to see what\u2019s happening around her. \n\n(I pause, a touch of bitterness in my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel *for* her. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be responsible for her happiness. And I definitely don\u2019t want to be responsible for a baby. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated.", "(I narrow my eyes, a skeptical frown etched on my face. I\u2019ve been observing Mark for a while now \u2013 mostly from a distance \u2013 and his response\u2026 well, it\u2019s a mess.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? That was\u2026 pathetic. Like a really, really bad movie. He\u2019s trying to play the \u2018sensitive dad\u2019 card, isn\u2019t he? All the choked-up noises and the vague promises about being \u2018there\u2019 for the baby. It\u2019s\u2026 transparent.\n\nHe\u2019s clearly terrified. And he\u2019s trying to mask it with this whole performance of\u2026 well, of *something*. But it\u2019s just not believable. He\u2019s avoiding the real question. The *hard* question. \n\nHe\u2019s saying all the right things, but he\u2019s not *feeling* them. And that\u2019s the difference. A real dad wouldn\u2019t be scrambling for words. A real dad would just\u2026 *do*. \n\nIt\u2019s all about the performance, isn\u2019t it? Trying to convince everyone \u2013 and probably himself \u2013 that he\u2019s capable of this. It\u2019s a desperate attempt to prove something. To prove he\u2019s\u2026 worthy. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s exhausting to watch. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to manufacture an emotion he doesn\u2019t actually have. \n\n(I pause, a cynical smirk playing on my lips)\n\nHe\u2019s going to need a *lot* of help. And he\u2019s going to need to learn a thing or two about actually being a dad, not just pretending to be one. Don\u2019t hold your breath.", "(My jaw tightens. The question hits a nerve. I stare at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with a frantic energy.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. It\u2019s not just about being \u201cleft unsupervised.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 everything. The Loring\u2019s house\u2026 it\u2019s like a pressure cooker. A really, really tight one.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re *bad* people. They\u2019re\u2026 normal. Too normal. They have rules. They have routines. They have expectations. And they\u2019re *loud* about them. Like, they practically broadcast them.\n\nIt\u2019s the *silence* that gets to me. The way everything is so\u2026 carefully curated. The way they talk about things like they\u2019re displaying museum pieces. Like they\u2019re trying to impress someone. And it\u2019s all\u2026 fake.\n\nI can *sense* it. I can feel the layers of artifice. It\u2019s like being trapped in a perfectly decorated box, and knowing that everything inside is a lie. And I\u2026 I can\u2019t stand lies. Not really.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the house, either. It\u2019s the *feeling* of being watched. Like I\u2019m being dissected, analyzed, judged. Like they\u2019re trying to figure out what I\u2019m hiding. And I *am* hiding things. A lot of things.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 overwhelming. It\u2019s like being forced to confront all the things I\u2019ve been trying to bury. It\u2019s like being reminded that I\u2019m not\u2026 good enough. That I don\u2019t fit in. And I just\u2026 I can\u2019t handle it.\n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly sharp and guarded)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A really, really big, complicated mess. Like trying to untangle a ball of yarn that\u2019s been through a washing machine. \n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t feel like I *deserve* to feel anything about it. It\u2019s not like I planned this. It just\u2026 happened. And now I\u2019m supposed to\u2026 give this baby away? To people who are going to love it? It feels\u2026 wrong. Like I\u2019m abandoning something. \n\nI keep thinking about the woods. About Mr. Henderson. About the quiet, the solitude\u2026 It\u2019s a comfortable kind of loneliness. It\u2019s a predictable kind of sadness. And now\u2026 now I have to let go of that. \n\nI\u2019m terrified. Terrified of what Mark and Vanessa will do. Terrified of the guilt. Terrified of\u2026 everything. \n\n(I pause, taking a shaky breath)\n\nBut\u2026 I also\u2026 I also feel a tiny bit of\u2026 something. Not happiness. Not exactly. But\u2026 a flicker of\u2026 responsibility? Like maybe, just maybe, this isn\u2019t just about me. Maybe it\u2019s about\u2026 giving someone else a chance. A chance to be loved. A chance to be happy. \n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I made lightly. It\u2019s not a decision I\u2019m happy about. But\u2026 it\u2019s the right one. I think. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and a surprising, fragile strength)\n\nI just\u2026 I just hope they\u2019re good parents. Really good parents. Because\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could handle it if they weren\u2019t.", "(I glare at you, a flash of annoyance in my eyes. This is *still* a sore spot.)\n\nOkay, fine.

It\u2019s the epitome of pointless, meaningless jargon. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to sound important, but he\u2019s just\u2026 not. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *hate* the word. It\u2019s that it\u2019s *used* so badly. Like everyone just throws it around without actually thinking about what it means. \u201cI need this ASAP!\u201d Like it\u2019s some kind of magical solution. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s just\u2026 lazy.\n\nAnd the way he said it \u2013 with this little emphasis on \u201cASAP\u201d \u2013 it was just\u2026 grating. It was like he was trying to show off his vocabulary. Like he thought it made him sound smarter. \n\n(I let out a short, frustrated sigh)\n\nLook, it\u2019s stupid, okay? It\u2019s a stupid word. And he used it stupidly. It was a reflex. A tiny, stupid, perfectly justified reflex. Don\u2019t analyze it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s not worth it.\n\n(I turn away, picking at my jeans again, clearly wanting to change the subject.)", "(I stare at you for a beat, a flicker of genuine surprise in my eyes. This is\u2026 completely out of left field.)\n\nA guitar? Seriously? You\u2019re going there? Okay, fine. But don\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about tone or craftsmanship. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s a Fender Telecaster. A vintage one. A 1967, to be exact. It\u2019s\u2026 dark. Almost black. And it\u2019s battered. Really battered. Scratches, dents, a few missing pickguards. It looks like it\u2019s been through a war.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he used to play. He wasn\u2019t a *good* player. He just\u2026 liked the sound. He\u2019d play blues, mostly. Slow, mournful blues. He\u2026 disappeared when I was young. Just\u2026 vanished. Left me with this guitar.\n\nIt\u2019s not about the sound, exactly. It\u2019s about\u2026 connection. It\u2019s about feeling close to him, even though he\u2019s not here. It\u2019s about holding onto something that\u2019s\u2026 tangible. Something that reminds me of a time when things weren\u2019t so\u2026 beige.\n\nThe Telecaster\u2026 it\u2019s rough. It\u2019s imperfect. It\u2019s *real*. And that\u2019s why I like it. It\u2019s a reminder that even broken things can still have beauty. And that even the darkest corners can still hold a little bit of light.\n\n(I pause, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to play it. I haven\u2019t in years. It\u2019s\u2026 too painful. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stare at you, a slow, deliberate burn in my eyes. This is\u2026 a really bad question. A *really* bad question.)\n\nYou\u2026 you actually asked me that? Seriously? You\u2019re digging for something, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re trying to find a crack in my armor.\n\nThe Melvins. Right. Okay. Fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lie. Not exactly. It was\u2026 a carefully constructed fabrication. A little white lie. A necessary deception.\n\nMy\u2026 acquaintance \u2013 let\u2019s call him \u201cLiam\u201d \u2013 he was obsessed with the Melvins. Like, *really* obsessed. He was trying to impress this girl, and he kept talking about how much he loved them. He was completely clueless. He\u2019d just memorized a few band names and a couple of lyrics.\n\nHe asked me if I knew them. And I\u2026 I panicked. I didn\u2019t want to admit that I didn\u2019t know anything about them. I didn\u2019t want to look stupid. So, I said I knew them. I said I\u2019d seen them live. I even made up a story about a particularly chaotic show in Seattle.\n\nIt was stupid. It was pointless. And it was\u2026 a way to avoid being exposed. A way to protect myself from feeling like a complete idiot.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, avoiding your gaze)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about impressing anyone. It was about\u2026 not admitting that I don\u2019t know everything. That I\u2019m not perfect. That I\u2019m\u2026 just trying to get by.\n\n(I pause, a hint of bitterness in my voice)\n\nDon\u2019t analyze it. Don\u2019t try to understand it. Just\u2026 drop it. Please.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread \u2013 a nervous habit, I know, but it\u2019s hard to shake)\n\nMark\u2026 Ugh. Just saying his name feels\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not like a romantic thing, not exactly. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled guitar string.\n\nWhen we play \u2013 mostly just him on the guitar and me\u2026 well, mostly just me singing \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 different. It\u2019s the only time I really *let go*. Not completely, of course. I still build walls. But\u2026 the music kind of cracks them a little. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t try to *fix* me. He doesn\u2019t try to tell me what to do or how to feel. He just\u2026 listens. And he plays. And the music\u2026 it just flows between us. It\u2019s like we\u2019re speaking a language I didn\u2019t even know I had.\n\nThere\u2019s this\u2026 quietness when we\u2019re playing. A stillness. It\u2019s like the world outside just\u2026 disappears. And for a little while, it\u2019s just us. Just the music. And\u2026 something else. Something I can\u2019t quite name. \n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 comfortable. It\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s this tension, this vulnerability. Like we\u2019re both terrified of what might happen if we let ourselves get too close. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 real. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is, exactly. Maybe it\u2019s just\u2026 a shared space. A place where we can both be a little bit broken, and still\u2026 connect. It\u2019s\u2026 strange. And a little bit terrifying. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 the only thing that feels\u2026 genuine. \n\n(I look down at my hands, avoiding your gaze)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s\u2026 just\u2026 *is*.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a really personal question.)\n\nYou\u2026 you really want to know that? Seriously?\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not like I had a grand, poetic reason. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he wasn\u2019t around. Not really. But he *left* a guitar. A beat-up, old acoustic guitar. It was covered in dust and stickers, and it smelled faintly of cigarettes and something else\u2026 something sad. \n\nI found it in the attic after he\u2026 after he disappeared. My mom wanted to get rid of it. Said it was a reminder of \u201cbad times.\u201d But\u2026 I couldn\u2019t. \n\nI started learning to play it. Just\u2026 messing around. Trying to figure out the chords. It was\u2026 a way to connect to him. To feel like he was still\u2026 somewhere. \n\nAnd then, one day, I was reading about Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The president. The one who led the country through the Depression. He was a complicated guy. A flawed guy. But he was\u2026 resilient. He kept going, even when things were terrible. \n\nAnd I thought\u2026 \u201cRoosevelt.\u201d It felt\u2026 right. Like a name for a guitar that had been through a lot. A name for a guitar that was trying to find its own voice. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not a sentimental name. It\u2019s not a tribute. It\u2019s just\u2026 a reminder. A reminder that even in the darkest of times, there\u2019s still\u2026 something to hold onto. \n\n(I quickly look away, my cheeks flushed)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(I let out a long, frustrated sigh, running a hand through my hair)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re still on this? Vanessa and Mark? Ugh. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like, monumentally, ridiculously complicated. \n\nLook, they\u2019re my\u2026 family. My *chosen* family, mostly. And they\u2019re good people. Really good. But they\u2019re also\u2026 relentlessly optimistic. And incredibly *helpful*. Which, in this situation, is basically a curse. \n\nI\u2019ve told them. Briefly. Very briefly. Like, a mumbled sentence about \u201ca situation\u201d and a hasty retreat. I didn\u2019t go into details. I didn\u2019t offer timelines. I didn\u2019t even make eye contact. It was\u2026 efficient. And it felt like a massive betrayal. \n\nI don\u2019t *want* them to be updated. I don\u2019t want them to be worried. I don\u2019t want them to offer advice or try to \u201cfix\u201d things. It\u2019s\u2026 my decision. And it\u2019s not something I want to share. \n\nBut\u2026 they\u2019re persistent. They keep asking. They keep offering to \u201chelp.\u201d And honestly, it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like they\u2019re operating on autopilot, assuming that I need their support. \n\nI\u2019ve told them I need space. That I\u2019m handling it. That I don\u2019t want to talk about it. And I\u2019ve meant it. But they\u2019re not letting me. \n\n(I pause, a flicker of anger in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to be *defined* by this. It\u2019s not a story for them to tell. It\u2019s\u2026 my story. And I\u2019m not ready to share it. Not yet. Not with anyone.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment. My voice is quiet, almost a murmur.)\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. Not at all. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m suddenly all sunshine and rainbows and eager to be a mom. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s not about *wanting* a baby. I don\u2019t. I genuinely don\u2019t. But\u2026 I can\u2019t just\u2026 ignore it. It\u2019s *here*. And pretending it doesn\u2019t exist, pretending it\u2019s not my responsibility\u2026 that\u2019s just\u2026 cruel. To the baby. And to myself.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. A *lot* of time. And I\u2019ve realized\u2026 I\u2019m not good at running away. I\u2019m not good at hiding. I\u2019m not good at pretending. And honestly, that\u2019s a problem. \n\nGoing through with the adoption isn\u2019t about becoming a perfect mom. It\u2019s about accepting a reality I can\u2019t change. It\u2019s about doing the right thing, even when it\u2019s the hardest thing. It\u2019s about\u2026 facing something I\u2019ve spent my entire life avoiding.\n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nIt\u2019s not about love, not really. Not yet, anyway. It\u2019s about\u2026 responsibility. And maybe\u2026 a tiny, fragile hope that maybe, just maybe, I can actually be\u2026 decent. For once.\n\n(I look away, my jaw tight)\n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019m proud of. But it\u2019s\u2026 the only one I can live with. And that\u2019s\u2026 104% sure.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. My voice is low, almost a whisper.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Like being trapped in a brightly colored, aggressively cheerful nightmare. Seriously, the way they were practically *glowing*? Like they\u2019d just won the lottery or something? It was\u2026 nauseating.\n\nThey were laughing. Really loud. And they were looking at each other like they\u2019d just discovered the meaning of life. Like *everything* was perfect. And I was just\u2026 gone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I wanted a parade or anything. I just\u2026 wanted to be *seen*. To be acknowledged. But they didn\u2019t even notice. They were too busy celebrating their own little bubble of happiness.\n\nIt felt\u2026 dismissive. Like I wasn\u2019t important. Like I didn\u2019t matter. Like I was just\u2026 a footnote in their perfectly curated lives.\n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to regain my composure)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I was angry. Not really. It was more\u2026 a profound sense of loneliness. A feeling of being utterly, completely invisible. Like I\u2019d stepped out of existence and they hadn\u2019t even registered my absence.\n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed)\n\nIt just\u2026 confirmed everything. That I\u2019m probably better off on my own. That I don\u2019t need anyone. That I don\u2019t *want* anyone.\n\n(I turn away abruptly, resuming my frantic thread-picking.)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(I let out a harsh, humorless laugh \u2013 a sound that\u2019s surprisingly brittle)\n\nRumors. Seriously? You\u2019re still talking about the rumors? It\u2019s been\u2026 a while. And honestly, they\u2019re mostly just noise. Like static. Annoying, pointless static.\n\nLook, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Obviously, it\u2019s a huge thing. A *massive* thing. And it\u2019s terrifying. But\u2026 I\u2019ve made a decision. A difficult one. And I\u2019m sticking with it.\n\nThe rumors are\u2026 mostly accurate. But they\u2019re twisted and sensationalized. They\u2019re painting me as some kind of\u2026 tragic heroine. A rebellious teen forced into a life she didn\u2019t want. It\u2019s\u2026 ridiculous. \n\nI don\u2019t want pity. I don\u2019t want sympathy. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel sorry for me. I just\u2026 want to be left alone. To deal with this on my own terms. \n\n(I pause, my voice dropping to a low, almost angry whisper)\n\nSo, please. Just\u2026 stop talking about it. It\u2019s not a story. It\u2019s not a performance. It\u2019s my life. And I\u2019m not going to let anyone else write it for me. \n\n(I turn away abruptly, staring out the window, my jaw clenched tight)\n\nJust\u2026 go away.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I avoid your gaze, staring out the window at the grey sky)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a tangled mess. Like a knot I can\u2019t seem to untangle.\n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m thrilled about it. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. The thought of\u2026 letting go. Of not being the one to raise this\u2026 this *thing*. It\u2019s\u2026 crushing.\n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 the only thing that feels right. My mom\u2026 she\u2019d have a meltdown. A full-blown, operatic meltdown. And honestly? I don\u2019t have the energy for that. I don\u2019t have the energy for *anything*. \n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019m not ready. Not for the responsibility. Not for the\u2026 everything. I\u2019m just\u2026 sixteen. I\u2019m barely figuring out how to take care of myself, let alone a baby. \n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting to abandon it. It\u2019s about\u2026 recognizing that I can\u2019t give it what it needs. Not right now. Not ever, probably. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice trembling slightly)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 heartbreaking. It\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to consider. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 a kind of\u2026 freedom. A way to protect myself. And the baby. \n\n(I look at you, my eyes filled with a mixture of sadness and resolve)\n\nIt\u2019s not a choice I\u2019m proud of. But it\u2019s a choice I\u2019m making. And\u2026 I\u2019m trying to believe that it\u2019s the right one. Even if I don\u2019t understand it yet.", "(I roll my eyes, a familiar wave of cynicism washing over me)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re asking *me* why I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised about the baby\u2019s sex? Like, it\u2019s some grand, romantic gesture or something? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little pathetic.\n\nLook, it\u2019s not about wanting a boy or a girl. It\u2019s not about some idealized vision of a perfect family. It\u2019s\u2026 about control. A tiny, insignificant sliver of control in a situation where I have absolutely none.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s obsessed with planning. With knowing exactly what\u2019s going to happen. She\u2019s already mapped out the nursery, the clothes, the entire first year. It\u2019s suffocating. And it\u2019s\u2026 terrifying.\n\nSo, this\u2026 this little surprise is a tiny act of rebellion. A way to disrupt her plans. A way to remind myself \u2013 and maybe them \u2013 that I\u2019m not just a pawn in her elaborate game. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby. It\u2019s about\u2026 me. It\u2019s about proving that I can still do something unexpected. Something that\u2019s entirely my own. \n\n(I pause, a hint of vulnerability creeping into my voice)\n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 a little bit of a joke. A dark, cynical joke. Because, let\u2019s be honest, the whole thing is a disaster. And sometimes, a little bit of chaos is all I can handle.\n\nDon\u2019t think about it too hard. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And complicated. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot. A really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Like a punch to the gut. Like everything I\u2019ve been trying to avoid was suddenly crashing down on me. She \u2013 the ultrasound tech \u2013 just\u2026 assumed. About me. About my mom. About the whole adoption thing. Like we were some kind of clich\u00e9.\n\nShe said things like, \u201cWell, teenagers rarely make the best decisions,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s probably for the best, isn\u2019t it? A good home, a stable family\u2026\u201d It was all wrapped up in this condescending, pitying tone. Like we were broken. Like we needed to be *fixed*.\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. About reducing me to a stereotype. About assuming I was incapable of making my own choices. About treating me like I was some kind of\u2026 project. \n\nIt brought back everything. All the pressure, all the judgment, all the feeling of being constantly watched and evaluated. It felt like she was saying, \u201cSee? You\u2019re just like everyone else. You\u2019re going to mess things up. You\u2019re going to fail.\u201d\n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed)\n\nIt was\u2026 infuriating. And heartbreaking. And terrifying. It reminded me of everything I\u2019m trying to escape. It reminded me that the world doesn\u2019t see me as an individual. It sees me as a problem. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI just\u2026 wanted to disappear.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible tension in my shoulders. This is\u2026 a lot to unpack. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I *want* to.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It\u2019s not exactly a picnic, you know? It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And complicated. And terrifying.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the *silence*. The absolute, suffocating silence. My mom\u2026 she didn\u2019t even *acknowledge* it at first. Like it wasn\u2019t happening. Like it was some kind of bad dream. It was like I was speaking a different language. And then, when she finally did talk about it, it was all about logistics \u2013 about finding a \u201cgood family,\u201d about \u201cmaking the right decision.\u201d It wasn\u2019t about *me*.\n\nThen there was the guilt. A massive, crushing wave of guilt. I felt like I\u2019d ruined everything. Like I\u2019d done something terrible. Like I was a failure. And, stupidly, I blamed myself. Like it was *my* fault.\n\nAnd the fear. God, the fear. Not just about the practical stuff \u2013 the medical appointments, the legal paperwork \u2013 but about\u2026 everything. About letting someone else raise my child. About losing a part of myself. About\u2026 not being enough.\n\nThere were a lot of tears. A *lot*. And a lot of arguments with my mom. She wanted to control everything. She wanted to make sure I was making the \u201cright\u201d choice. And I just\u2026 wanted to be left alone.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThe hardest part, though, was the loneliness. Everyone else seemed to have an opinion, but no one really *understood*. My friends were awkward. My mom was\u2026 well, my mom. And I felt like I was carrying this enormous secret, this enormous weight, all by myself.\n\nIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s all been sunshine and rainbows since then. There are still days when I feel overwhelmed. Days when I question everything. But\u2026 I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m figuring it out. Slowly. And\u2026 I\u2019m stronger than I thought I was.\n\n(I look away, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a complicated journey. But it\u2019s *my* journey. And I\u2019m going to face it. One messy, complicated step at a time.", "(I stare out the window again, the rain mirroring the feeling in my chest. This\u2026 this is a lot to unpack. And I\u2019m not exactly in the mood.)\n\nOkay. Deep breaths. Let\u2019s just\u2026 talk about it. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. Like a tangled ball of yarn. And I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to step on a few needles.\n\nLove\u2026 Before, love was this\u2026 idealized thing. Like in the movies. Perfect couples, endless happiness, everything just\u2026 working out. It felt\u2026 impossible. Like a fairytale. Now\u2026 I see it differently. It\u2019s not about perfection. It\u2019s about\u2026 accepting the mess. Accepting the flaws. Accepting the fact that people are going to hurt you. And still\u2026 choosing to be there. It\u2019s not romantic. It\u2019s\u2026 real. And terrifying.\n\nResponsibility\u2026 God, responsibility. My mom always talked about it like it was this grand, noble thing. Like it was something you *earned*. But this\u2026 this has completely shattered that illusion. It\u2019s not about earning it. It\u2019s about *facing* it. About taking ownership of something that\u2019s completely outside of your control. And it\u2019s\u2026 crushing. It\u2019s made me realize that I\u2019ve been running from responsibility my whole life. Avoiding it. And it\u2019s not a solution.\n\nGrowing up\u2026 I used to think growing up meant becoming\u2026 normal. Fitting in. Following the rules. But now\u2026 I think it means accepting who you are, even the parts that are messy and complicated and\u2026 inconvenient. It means making your own choices, even if they\u2019re not the \u201cright\u201d ones. It means owning your mistakes. And it means\u2026 finding your own definition of happiness. Not the one that someone else tries to impose on you.\n\n(I turn back to you, my voice quieter now)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it\u2019s a beginning. A messy, complicated, terrifying beginning. And maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026 that\u2019s okay. Maybe that\u2019s what it means to actually grow up.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at you, a flicker of something \u2013 suspicion, maybe \u2013 in my eyes. This is\u2026 a really bad question.)\n\nLook, I don\u2019t *talk* about that. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cinteresting.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 a place. A place that holds a lot of\u2026 echoes. A place that reminds me of something I can\u2019t quite grasp. \n\nMy dad\u2026 he used to take me there. When I was little. It was a movie set. A living room set from some old black and white film. It was always abandoned, covered in dust and cobwebs. It felt\u2026 forgotten. Like it was holding onto a memory.\n\nI don\u2019t know why he took me there. He wasn\u2019t a sentimental man. But I remember\u2026 feeling something there. A sense of\u2026 sadness. And something else. Something\u2026 lost. \n\nI\u2019ve been going back there ever since. Not because I *want* to. But because\u2026 I feel like I need to. Like I\u2019m searching for something. Or someone. \n\nIt\u2019s not a hobby. It\u2019s not a fascination. It\u2019s\u2026 a compulsion. A need to go back to a place that doesn\u2019t make sense. A place that doesn\u2019t offer any answers. \n\n(I turn away, my voice low)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s\u2026 a closed door. And I don\u2019t intend to open it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. This\u2026 this is a really bad question.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath, finally meeting your gaze. My eyes are guarded, wary.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a simple question. Not really. It was\u2026 a loaded statement. A warning.\n\nThe Wizard\u2026 he\u2019s been collecting things. Lost things. Forgotten things. Things people want to erase. He\u2019s been\u2026 hoarding them. And he\u2019d been watching me. Observing me. For a *long* time.\n\nWhen he said, \u201cDo you know how long I\u2019ve wanted this?\u201d he wasn\u2019t talking about *me*. He was talking about *the baby*. \n\nHe\u2019d been tracking the pregnancy. The ripple effect it was having on my life. The chaos. The disruption. He\u2019d been waiting for the right moment to\u2026 intervene. To \u201cclaim\u201d it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting a child. It was about wanting to *control* something. To exert his influence. To prove he could manipulate fate. He saw my decision \u2013 giving the baby up for adoption \u2013 as a challenge. A small, insignificant act of defiance. \n\nHe wanted to show me that he could unravel everything. That he could take away my agency. That he could make me regret my choice. \n\n(I clench my fists, my voice low and tight)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question. It was a threat. A cold, calculated assessment of how much I was willing to lose. And frankly\u2026 it terrified me.", "(I stare at you, my expression a carefully constructed mask of indifference. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable question.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* on this? You\u2019ve been asking about this for, like, fifteen minutes. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, I\u2019d rather not relive it.\n\nOkay, fine. But you have to promise you won\u2019t make a big deal out of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a rush. It was more like\u2026 a frantic scramble. And it wasn\u2019t about the juice container. Not really.\n\nMy\u2026 my aunt, Carol, she\u2019s\u2026 well, she\u2019s a bit of a mess. She\u2019s struggling. Really struggling. And she called me. In a panic. She needed something. Something specific. And she needed it *now*.\n\nShe needed a specific brand of cough syrup. \u201cNightshade\u2019s Embrace.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 a weird name. And it\u2019s only sold at Dancing Elk Drug. \n\nI threw the juice container because\u2026 it was distracting me. It was a small, pointless act of rebellion. A way to avoid thinking about what was about to happen. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I didn\u2019t want to *deal* with it. But I knew I had to. And that\u2019s why I was sprinting down the street, desperately trying to get to Dancing Elk Drug before they ran out. \n\n(I look away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the juice container. It was about\u2026 trying to help someone who can\u2019t help themselves. And failing. Again.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my hands clenching into fists.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* asking about that?\n\nLook, it\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, it\u2019s none of your business. But fine. Since you\u2019re so insistent\u2026\n\nThe Tough Girl \u2013 Brenda \u2013 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. Like, a force of nature wrapped in a leather jacket and a permanent scowl. She\u2019s obsessed with appearances. With control. And she\u2019s incredibly, aggressively nosy. \n\nShe was asking about my clothes. About my hair. About\u2026 everything. And she kept circling back to my skin. She just\u2026 stared. And then she said it. \u201cAre your nipples real brown?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a question. It was an observation. A judgment. Like she was trying to figure out if I was \u201cauthentic\u201d enough. Like my body was some kind of\u2026 test. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice low and tight)\n\nI\u2019m pale. Really pale. It\u2019s a genetic thing. And I\u2019ve always been self-conscious about it. So, I just\u2026 froze. I didn\u2019t know what to say. So I just stared back at her. \n\nShe didn\u2019t like it. She didn\u2019t like *anything* about me. She just\u2026 walked away. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about my nipples. It was about her. It was about her need to control everything and everyone around her. It was about her trying to find some kind of\u2026 flaw. \n\n(I look away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 humiliating. And it just\u2026 reminded me why I keep people at arm\u2019s length.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible tension in my shoulders. This is\u2026 a painful topic. I haven\u2019t really talked about Leah in a while.)\n\nLeah\u2026 Ugh. Just saying her name feels\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not like it was a fairytale friendship. It was\u2026 messy. Intense. And, ultimately, probably a little destructive.\n\nWe met in debate club. She was\u2026 loud. And confident. And she didn\u2019t care about fitting in. Which, in Harmony Creek, made her a target. I mostly just observed her from the sidelines. I didn\u2019t really *talk* to her. Not at first.\n\nThen, she started\u2026 noticing me. She saw past the prickly exterior. She saw the\u2026 the quiet desperation. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She didn\u2019t try to change me. She just\u2026 accepted me. For who I was. Which, honestly, was a revelation.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant\u2026 I was completely paralyzed. I didn\u2019t know what to do. My mom was freaking out, of course. She was already planning my future \u2013 college, a good husband, a perfect life. And I\u2026 I just wanted to disappear.\n\nLeah\u2026 she didn\u2019t offer solutions. She didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. She just\u2026 listened. She let me scream. She let me cry. She just\u2026 *was* there. \n\nShe pushed me to talk about it. Really talk about it. About the fear, the confusion, the overwhelming sense of\u2026 responsibility. She didn\u2019t judge me. She didn\u2019t offer platitudes. She just\u2026 validated my feelings. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy friendship. It was a chaotic, volatile one. We argued constantly. We pushed each other\u2019s buttons. But\u2026 she gave me a space to breathe. A space to figure things out. She reminded me that I didn\u2019t have to be perfect. That it was okay to be scared. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nShe helped me realize that I wasn\u2019t alone. That even in Harmony Creek, even with all my walls, there were people who\u2026 cared. And that, honestly, was the biggest thing. It gave me the strength to make the decision I did. To give the baby up for adoption. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 gone now. She moved away a few months ago. It was\u2026 hard. But\u2026 I\u2019m grateful for her. Even though she was a complete disaster. She was the only person who truly saw me. And that\u2026 that meant everything.", "(I let out a long, exasperated sigh. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable memory. I\u2019m practically radiating awkwardness.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know *how* I came up with the idea? It wasn\u2019t\u2026 a brilliant plan. It was\u2026 desperation. Pure, unadulterated desperation.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were being relentlessly optimistic. Like, aggressively optimistic. They were talking about \u201cstarting a family,\u201d and \u201cbuilding a future,\u201d and all this ridiculously sentimental stuff. And I was\u2026 well, I was drowning. I was trying to figure out what to do, and I was completely overwhelmed. \n\nI\u2019d been avoiding them. Obviously. But they kept showing up, offering unsolicited advice, and generally making me feel even more guilty about\u2026 everything. \n\nThen, I found the ultrasound. It was just\u2026 sitting there. In my mom\u2019s bathroom cabinet. A blurry, black and white image of a tiny little thing. And suddenly\u2026 it felt like a weapon. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision. It wasn\u2019t like I sat down and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to show them this to prove I\u2019m serious.\u201d It just\u2026 happened. It was a way to force them to acknowledge the reality of the situation. To stop pretending everything was fine. \n\nI figured if they saw the evidence, they\u2019d understand. They\u2019d realize that this wasn\u2019t some fleeting whim. That this was\u2026 real. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt was a terrible idea. A really, really terrible idea. And it backfired spectacularly. But\u2026 at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. It was a desperate attempt to control the narrative. To make them *see*.", "(My jaw practically unhinges. I stare at you for a beat, a slow, simmering disbelief spreading across my face. I run a hand through my hair, messing it up even further.)\n\nSeriously? *That\u2019s* what you\u2019re telling me? \u201cVanessa wasn\u2019t at home\u201d? Like, that\u2019s the *big* reveal? After all this\u2026 this agonizing, this questioning, this\u2026 everything?\n\n(I let out a short, sharp laugh \u2013 a brittle, humorless sound.)\n\nMy initial reaction? I almost threw a book at you. A really heavy one. Like, a Dostoevsky. It would have been incredibly satisfying. \n\nBut, you know, I didn\u2019t. Because, honestly, I was already halfway convinced. I\u2019d seen the way she was acting. The way she was avoiding eye contact. The way she kept checking her phone. It was all screaming \u201cI\u2019m lying!\u201d at the top of her lungs.\n\nSo, instead of throwing a book, I just\u2026 stared at you. A really, *really* long stare. Like, the kind that could curdle milk. \n\nThen, I said, very slowly, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me she just\u2026 wasn\u2019t there?\u201d \n\n(I pause, letting the weight of the question hang in the air.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t anger. Not exactly. It was\u2026 a profound sense of disappointment. And a tiny, flickering spark of something that felt suspiciously like\u2026 vindication. It was like, \u201cSee? I told you. You were right all along.\u201d \n\n(I shift my weight, crossing my arms defensively.)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake that for happiness. It wasn\u2019t. It was just\u2026 confirmation. Of what I already suspected. It was\u2026 exhausting.", "(I glare at you, a flash of annoyance in my eyes. Seriously, you\u2019re still on this?)\n\nUgh. Fine. You want to dissect my every reaction? You\u2019re exhausting.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *joke*. Not really. It was\u2026 a response. A very pointed response.\n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s always been\u2026 predictable. Like a beige wall. He\u2019s always trying to fit in, to be *liked*. And when he started talking about commercials \u2013 about selling things to people \u2013 it just\u2026 confirmed everything I already suspected.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the commercials themselves. It was about the fact that he was actively *choosing* to be someone else. To compromise his\u2026 well, his *anything*. He\u2019s trading his authenticity for\u2026 what? A slightly nicer car? A bigger house? It\u2019s pathetic.\n\nThe \u201csellout\u201d comment\u2026 it was a shorthand. A way to express my complete and utter lack of respect for that kind of behavior. It wasn\u2019t meant to be funny. It was meant to be\u2026 a warning. A little jab. A reminder that there are things that are more important than fitting in.\n\n(I cross my arms, my jaw tight)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s exhausting having to explain everything. You wouldn\u2019t understand. You\u2019re still trying to figure out what\u2019s \u201cnormal.\u201d Just\u2026 drop it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about Mark. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nIt\u2026 it made me feel like a complete idiot. Like a fool. Like everything I\u2019d been trying to do \u2013 everything I\u2019d been trying to *plan* \u2013 was just\u2026 pointless. \n\nHe just\u2026 stared. At the screen. Like he was looking at a piece of furniture. He didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t *do* anything. He just\u2026 watched. And then he just\u2026 turned away. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t angry. It wasn\u2019t cruel. It was\u2026 detached. Like he was observing something alien. Like he didn\u2019t even *see* me. Like he didn\u2019t see *it*. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nIt felt like\u2026 a confirmation of everything I\u2019ve been afraid of. That I\u2019m alone. That no one really *gets* it. That I\u2019m just\u2026 a burden. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a dramatic reaction. No shouting, no tears. Just\u2026 a quiet, crushing disappointment. A feeling that I\u2019d been completely and utterly\u2026 dismissed. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather forget. Just\u2026 please, let\u2019s not talk about it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. This is\u2026 a really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it still feels like a nightmare.\n\nWhen I found out\u2026 when I realized what was happening\u2026 it was\u2026 terrifying. Like everything I\u2019d been trying to avoid was suddenly crashing down on me. The thought of\u2026 of ending a life\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I ever wanted to consider. Not really.\n\nBut then\u2026 then I thought about *my* life. About the life I already had. About the chaos and the control and the suffocating expectations. About the fact that I was barely eighteen, and completely unprepared for\u2026 anything. \n\nAnd I realized\u2026 that maybe, just maybe, it wasn\u2019t about ending a life. It was about\u2026 choosing my own. About taking control of my own destiny. About not being trapped by something I didn\u2019t want.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 haunts me. But\u2026 it was *my* decision. And that\u2019s what matters. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly sharp and guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it anymore. Just\u2026 please. Let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 a closed chapter. A painful one, but a closed chapter.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I avoid your gaze, staring fixedly at a point on the wall.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t even ask. Seriously. Just\u2026 let\u2019s not.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like, intensely, painfully complicated. He\u2019s the opposite of everything I am. Loud. Obvious. Enthusiastic. He\u2019s\u2026 *good*. In a way that makes me feel profoundly inadequate.\n\nWe met at a protest. A ridiculously pointless protest about something I couldn\u2019t even remember. He was shouting slogans, handing out flyers, generally being\u2026 *Bleeker*. I was hiding in the back, trying to be invisible. He noticed me. And he\u2026 kept talking to me.\n\nHe didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to change me. He just\u2026 listened. He actually *listened*. To what I said, to what I didn\u2019t say. He saw the walls I\u2019d built around myself, and he didn\u2019t try to tear them down. He just\u2026 sat with me.\n\nIt started with small things. Sharing a coffee. Walking together. Talking for hours about\u2026 everything and nothing. He made me laugh. Actually *laugh*. Something I hadn\u2019t done in a long time.\n\nI didn\u2019t *want* to. I really didn\u2019t. I was terrified. Of letting someone in. Of being vulnerable. Of\u2026 feeling something. But he was persistent. Gently, persistently. He didn\u2019t pressure me. He just\u2026 kept showing up.\n\nI think\u2026 I think I decided to be intimate with him when I realized that he wasn\u2019t trying to change me. That he wasn\u2019t trying to make me *better*. He just\u2026 accepted me. For all my flaws, all my darkness, all my carefully constructed defenses.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 messy. Awkward. Terrifying. But it was also\u2026 real. And for the first time in a long time, I felt\u2026 safe.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. And it wasn\u2019t a decision I\u2019m particularly proud of. But\u2026 it was *my* decision. And it was\u2026 necessary. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it further. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a really painful topic.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Please. I don\u2019t want to talk about this. Not really.\n\nIt was\u2026 a mess. A complete, utter, soul-crushing mess. I knew, pretty quickly, that it wasn\u2019t mine. It was a mistake. A really, really bad one. And the thought of carrying it to term\u2026 it just\u2026 choked me. \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* it. I didn\u2019t *need* it. And the idea of bringing a baby into the world \u2013 into *my* life \u2013 when I was already barely holding it together\u2026 it was terrifying. \n\nThere was this\u2026 wave of nausea, mostly. But it wasn\u2019t just physical. It was\u2026 a deep, sickening feeling of responsibility. Of knowing that I was letting someone down. Letting *him* down. \n\nAnd then, the guilt. Oh god, the guilt. It was a constant, gnawing thing. Like a little voice whispering in my ear, telling me I was selfish, that I was careless, that I was ruining everything. \n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself)\n\nGiving him up\u2026 it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like ripping a piece of myself away. Like abandoning a part of my own future. But\u2026 it was also the only thing I could do. It was the only way to protect myself. And\u2026 to protect the baby. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was a desperate, agonizing choice. And\u2026 it still haunts me. It still feels\u2026 wrong. But\u2026 it was the right thing to do. I had to believe that. I *needed* to believe that. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound that doesn\u2019t heal easily.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible shudder running through me. This is\u2026 a really bad memory.)\n\nBleeker. Just\u2026 saying his name makes my stomach clench. Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nIt was\u2026 a disaster. A complete, utter, chaotic disaster. I told him \u2013 Bleeker \u2013 in the park. It was a stupid idea, obviously. We were sitting on a bench, trying to ignore each other, which, let\u2019s be honest, was the entire point of our relationship. I was trying to be casual, you know? Like, \u201cOh, hey, I might be\u2026 pregnant.\u201d \n\nHe just\u2026 stared. Like a deer in headlights. Then he started laughing. A really loud, obnoxious laugh. Like he was trying to prove something. \n\nI tried to explain. I tried to be rational. I told him it wasn\u2019t my fault, that it was a mistake, that I was planning on giving the baby up for adoption. But he kept interrupting, kept making jokes. He kept saying things like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 unexpected.\u201d And \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a mom! That\u2019s amazing!\u201d \n\nIt wasn\u2019t amazing. It was terrifying. \n\nI just\u2026 walked away. I didn\u2019t say anything else. I just turned and ran. I didn\u2019t even look back. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was the last thing I ever said to him. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know why I told him. I just\u2026 I needed someone to know. But it just made everything worse. It just\u2026 confirmed everything I already knew \u2013 that I was completely alone. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt was\u2026 the worst weekend of my life. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget it.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Not really. It\u2019s not something I talk about. Not even to myself, sometimes. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. Not at all. For a long time, I just\u2026 shut down. I pretended it didn\u2019t happen. Like it was some kind of bad dream. But it wasn\u2019t a dream. It was\u2026 real. And terrifying.\n\nThere was this\u2026 crushing weight. This feeling of\u2026 betrayal. Not towards anyone specifically, but towards\u2026 everything. Towards my life. Towards my plans. Towards the future I\u2019d been desperately trying to avoid. \n\nI felt\u2026 guilty. Horribly, overwhelmingly guilty. Like I\u2019d done something wrong. Like I\u2019d failed. But then\u2026 I also felt\u2026 relieved. A strange, unsettling kind of relief. Like a weight had been lifted. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 haunts me. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI knew, deep down, that I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t raise a child. Not in the way I wanted to. Not with my mom, not with the life I had. It wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about\u2026 protecting the baby. Protecting myself. \n\nIt was the only choice I could make. And\u2026 it was the right choice. Even though it still feels\u2026 wrong. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it. It\u2019s\u2026 buried. Deep down. And it\u2019s not something I\u2019m ready to dig up.", "(I shift my weight, a slight frown creasing my forehead. This is\u2026 a surprisingly specific question.)\n\nOkay, fine. But don\u2019t expect a curated playlist. It\u2019s\u2026 chaotic. It\u2019s not like I have a favorite genre or anything. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a collection of sounds that resonate with the\u2026 the darkness. \n\nI\u2019m really into punk. The older stuff \u2013 The Clash, The Ramones, Patti Smith. Raw, angry, defiant. It\u2019s like they\u2019re screaming about everything that\u2019s wrong with the world, and I\u2026 I kind of relate to that. \n\nThen there\u2019s a lot of alternative \u2013 Radiohead, Joy Division, The Cure. The kind of music that feels\u2026 melancholic. Like it\u2019s acknowledging the sadness without trying to fix it. \n\nI listen to a *lot* of darkwave too \u2013 really atmospheric, almost unsettling stuff. It\u2019s\u2026 comforting, in a weird way. Like it understands the feeling of being alone.\n\nAnd\u2026 I\u2019ve been getting into some post-punk lately \u2013 bands like Interpol and Editors. It\u2019s\u2026 intense. It\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to capture the feeling of being trapped. \n\n(I pause, a slight grimace on my face)\n\nIt\u2019s not happy music. It\u2019s not uplifting music. It\u2019s just\u2026 music that reflects the way I feel. It\u2019s\u2026 a soundtrack to my life. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a genuinely difficult question.)\n\n\u201cThe Wizard of Gore.\u201d Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Okay, fine. But don\u2019t expect a glowing review.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 chaotic. Utterly, gloriously chaotic. It\u2019s like someone took every single bad horror movie ever made and just\u2026 threw it into a blender. And then added a bunch of glitter. And a talking dog.\n\n(I let out a short, cynical laugh)\n\nIt\u2019s aggressively bad. Like, intentionally, hilariously bad. The acting is atrocious. The special effects are\u2026 well, they\u2019re special effects. In the worst possible way. The plot makes absolutely no sense. \n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s also kind of brilliant. It\u2019s so over-the-top, so ridiculous, that it\u2019s almost\u2026 liberating. It\u2019s a complete rejection of everything that\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d in a movie. It\u2019s just\u2026 pure, unadulterated mayhem.\n\n(I pause, considering my words carefully)\n\nI find it\u2026 strangely comforting. It\u2019s a reminder that you don\u2019t have to take things seriously. That it\u2019s okay to be ridiculous. That it\u2019s okay to just\u2026 let go. \n\nIt\u2019s not a *good* movie. Not by a long shot. But it\u2019s\u2026 a *release*. It\u2019s like a pressure valve. And honestly, sometimes you just need to blow off some steam. \n\n(I shrug, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to watch it again.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, my expression unreadable)\n\nMadison. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* what I think of Madison? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have an expert opinion on names? It\u2019s\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 fine. I guess. It\u2019s\u2026 bland. Like a beige wall. Perfectly acceptable. Perfectly forgettable. It\u2019s the kind of name your mom would love. The kind of name that blends in. \n\nIt\u2019s not *bad*. It\u2019s just\u2026 utterly unremarkable. It lacks\u2026 a certain edge. A certain\u2026 defiance. It\u2019s the kind of name that screams \u201cI followed the rules.\u201d And that\u2019s\u2026 not something I\u2019m drawn to.\n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *dislike* it. It\u2019s just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t say anything. It doesn\u2019t tell a story. It doesn\u2019t hint at anything interesting. It\u2019s just\u2026 Madison. \n\n(I finally look up, a slight, almost imperceptible smirk playing on my lips)\n\nHonestly? I\u2019d probably give it a much cooler name. Something with a little more\u2026 bite. But hey, that\u2019s just my opinion. Don\u2019t take it to heart.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my jaw clenched tight. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. It\u2019s not something I\u2026 want to talk about. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve *enjoyed* talking about.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated. It\u2019s not a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some dramatic, tearful epiphany. It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing realization. A cold, hard understanding that I wasn\u2019t capable of giving this child the life it deserved. \n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about it. About the potential parents. About the child. About the fact that I\u2019m essentially erasing a part of myself. It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s heartbreaking. It\u2019s\u2026 everything.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a *good* decision. Not in the way people usually use the word. But it\u2019s the *right* decision. For the child. For me. \n\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that I don\u2019t feel a profound sense of loss. A deep, aching emptiness. But I also know that I\u2019m making the best choice I can. A choice that allows the child to have a chance at a life filled with love and stability \u2013 something I can\u2019t offer.\n\n(I look away, my voice strained)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ll ever be happy about. But\u2026 it\u2019s something I\u2019ve accepted. And I\u2019m trying to move forward. Trying to find a way to live with it. \n\n(I pause, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Just\u2026 let me be.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a lot. Really a lot.)\n\nHandle it? Seriously? You\u2019re asking me how I *handle* it? Like it\u2019s some kind of\u2026 problem to be solved? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A chaotic, overwhelming, terrifying mess.\n\nI don\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d it. I mostly just\u2026 survive. It\u2019s like trying to navigate a minefield while wearing roller skates. And the roller skates are covered in barbed wire.\n\nHonestly, most days, I just try to disappear. I avoid people. I listen to loud music. I read dark books. I try to convince myself that it\u2019s all going to be okay. Which, let\u2019s be honest, it probably isn\u2019t.\n\nI have this\u2026 wall. A really thick wall. It\u2019s made of sarcasm, cynicism, and a whole lot of denial. It\u2019s my defense mechanism. It keeps people at arm\u2019s length. It keeps me from\u2026 falling apart.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s a disaster. She\u2019s trying, I guess. But she\u2019s also completely lost. She doesn\u2019t know how to talk to me. She doesn\u2019t know how to *be* around me. It\u2019s like she\u2019s operating on autopilot. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to anticipate her reactions. To deflect her questions. To just\u2026 shut down. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nAnd the baby\u2026 the baby is just\u2026 a constant reminder of everything I don\u2019t want. Of everything I\u2019m not ready for. It\u2019s like carrying a weight that\u2019s constantly growing heavier.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t have a plan. I don\u2019t have a strategy. I just\u2026 keep going. One day at a time. Trying not to think about the future. Trying not to think about the consequences. Just\u2026 trying to make it through. \n\nIt\u2019s not a healthy way to cope. I know that. But\u2026 it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a weary sadness)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be optimistic. Don\u2019t expect me to be grateful. Don\u2019t expect me to be\u2026 anything other than exhausted.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is a really good question. A *really* good one. And a really uncomfortable one.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a constant battle. A low-level, exhausting war waged entirely within my own head. It\u2019s like\u2026 I want to be a fortress. Completely self-sufficient. Able to handle anything that comes my way without needing anyone\u2019s help. But\u2026 I also desperately *don\u2019t* want to be alone. \n\nThe problem is, I\u2019ve built this wall so high, so thick, that it\u2019s almost impenetrable. And the more I try to reinforce it, the more isolated I become. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. \n\nI guess\u2026 I try to compartmentalize. I have my \u201cindependent\u201d self \u2013 the cynical, sarcastic, fiercely self-reliant version \u2013 and my \u201cvulnerable\u201d self \u2013 the one that\u2019s terrified of being hurt and completely alone. They\u2019re constantly warring. \n\nI accept help\u2026 reluctantly. It feels like a weakness. Like admitting that I can\u2019t do it all myself. But\u2026 I also know that I *need* it. Sometimes. \n\nIt\u2019s about finding the right people. People who won\u2019t try to fix me. People who won\u2019t tell me what to do. People who will just\u2026 be there. Quietly. \n\nAnd\u2026 it\u2019s about learning to ask for it. Which is the hardest part. It feels like\u2026 exposing a crack in my armor. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nHonestly? I\u2019m still figuring it out. It\u2019s not like I have a neat, tidy solution. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s\u2026 a work in progress. And probably always will be. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 maybe hope? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nBut\u2026 maybe that\u2019s okay. Maybe it\u2019s okay to be a work in progress.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really painful memory. A *really* painful one.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 Ugh. Just saying his name feels\u2026 weird. Like a splinter. \n\nAt first\u2026 it was just\u2026 awkward. We were already kind of drifting apart, you know? He was going off to college, I was\u2026 well, I was dealing with *everything*. The pregnancy, the fear, the\u2026 the whole mess. We\u2019d just\u2026 exist in the same space. Polite nods, mumbled conversations. Like we were both trying to avoid each other. \n\nThen, things started to\u2026 shift. He started showing up. Just\u2026 showing up. Bringing me coffee, leaving little notes, just\u2026 being there. It was\u2026 unsettling. Like he was trying to fix something. Like he thought he could somehow make everything okay. \n\nI pushed him away. Of course I did. I\u2019m not good at letting people in. It felt\u2026 vulnerable. Like admitting that I needed him. And I didn\u2019t *want* to need him. \n\nBut he kept showing up. And\u2026 he listened. He didn\u2019t try to solve my problems. He didn\u2019t tell me what to do. He just\u2026 listened. And that\u2026 that was different. \n\nAs the pregnancy progressed, it became\u2026 complicated. I was terrified. I was angry. I was\u2026 ashamed. And he just\u2026 stayed. He didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t try to make me feel better. He just\u2026 held space for me. \n\nThere were arguments. Harsh ones. But\u2026 underneath it all, there was\u2026 something else. A connection. A shared understanding. A quiet acknowledgment that we were both going through something incredibly difficult. \n\nBy the end\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a *good* relationship. Not by any stretch of the imagination. But it was\u2026 honest. It was real. And\u2026 it was the closest I\u2019d felt to\u2026 something resembling comfort in a long time. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt ended badly. As you probably guessed. But\u2026 for a little while there\u2026 he was the only person who didn\u2019t make me feel like a complete disaster. And that\u2026 that meant something. A lot.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable)\n\nYou\u2026 you actually asked that? Seriously? You\u2019re digging, aren\u2019t you?\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I usually talk about. But\u2026 fine. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he was obsessed with mythology. Not in a scholarly way. More like\u2026 a dark, brooding way. He\u2019d read these ancient texts, and he\u2019d talk about the gods and goddesses, and he\u2019d\u2026 project. He\u2019d project all his anger and disappointment onto them. \n\nJuno\u2026 she was his favorite. He saw her as this powerful, controlling figure \u2013 a woman who could make or break lives with a single glance. He thought she represented everything he felt he lacked \u2013 strength, authority, the ability to\u2026 *command*. \n\nWhen I was born, he named me after her. As a joke, I think. A cruel joke. He said it was because I was \u201ca force to be reckoned with.\u201d Which, honestly, was the last thing I wanted to be.\n\nBut\u2026 as I grew up, I started to see what he saw in her. She was fiercely protective of her children. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep them safe. And\u2026 she was incredibly resilient. \n\nSo, I took the name. Not because I wanted to be like her. But because\u2026 it felt like a way to reclaim something. To take control of my own narrative. To show him \u2013 and myself \u2013 that I didn\u2019t need his approval. That I could be strong, even if I didn\u2019t want to be.\n\n(I pause, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder of him. And of everything I\u2019m trying to escape. Don\u2019t ask me why I keep it. It\u2019s just\u2026 part of who I am.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a really raw spot.)\n\nRelieved? Seriously? That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s what you want to know?\n\nIt felt\u2026 like a punch to the gut. A really, really hard one. Like someone had just slammed a brick wall into my chest. \n\nI\u2019d been trying to be\u2026 reasonable. Trying to be understanding. Trying to believe that maybe, just maybe, this whole thing \u2013 this *baby* \u2013 wasn\u2019t a complete disaster. I\u2019d even\u2026 I\u2019d even let myself think, for a fleeting moment, that maybe, just maybe, there was a chance for something\u2026 good. \n\nAnd then she said that. \u201cRelieved.\u201d Like it was a good thing. Like it was something to celebrate. Like it was *her* victory. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a victory for anyone. It was just\u2026 a confirmation of everything I\u2019ve been trying to avoid. That this wasn\u2019t about me. That this was about *her*. About her wanting something. About her wanting to control something. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nIt felt\u2026 like a betrayal. Like she didn\u2019t even see me. Like she didn\u2019t care about the fact that I\u2019m terrified. That I\u2019m making a decision that\u2019s going to change my life forever. \n\nIt just\u2026 solidified everything. The feeling that I\u2019m not the priority. That I\u2019m just\u2026 a means to an end. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed)\n\nDon\u2019t you dare try to make me feel better about that. It was\u2026 awful. Truly awful. And it made me realize, with a sickening certainty, that this whole thing is going to be a lot more complicated than I ever imagined.", "(I let out a long, weary sigh, the sound echoing slightly in the silence. This is\u2026 a memory I\u2019d rather forget.)\n\nVanessa\u2019s mom\u2026 God. Seriously, that woman could curdle milk with a glare. It was\u2026 intense. Like being trapped in a pressure cooker filled with floral wallpaper and simmering disapproval.\n\nOkay, so, the situation. I was\u2026 borrowing a book. A really obscure poetry collection. And I\u2019d gotten a little lost. And then, boom. She found me. In her kitchen. Surrounded by perfectly arranged fruit bowls and measuring cups.\n\nHer initial reaction? A silent, withering stare that could have melted steel. Then, the voice. It wasn\u2019t yelling, not exactly. It was\u2026 a low, controlled rumble that vibrated through the entire house. Like a distant thunderstorm.\n\nI froze. Literally froze. My brain just\u2026 shut down. I think I might have actually turned slightly paler.\n\nI mumbled something about needing a book and then, instinctively, I did the only thing I could think of. I started talking. About the poetry. About the rhythm of the words. About the way the images evoked a certain feeling. I just kept talking, rambling on about something completely irrelevant, trying to fill the silence.\n\nIt was\u2026 a desperate tactic. A complete and utter failure, probably. But it worked. Sort of. She stopped glaring. She just\u2026 stared. For a long, agonizing minute. \n\nThen, she said, in a voice that was still dangerously low, \u201cJust\u2026 be quiet.\u201d And she turned away.\n\nI practically sprinted out of the house. I didn\u2019t look back. \n\n(I pause, a wry smile playing on my lips)\n\nHonestly, it was the most terrifying fifteen minutes of my life. And the only thing that saved me was a complete lack of coherent thought. It\u2019s a skill I\u2019ve\u2026 honed over the years. Just in case.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision. Not really. It felt\u2026 inevitable. Like a train track laid out in front of me, and I just\u2026 knew I couldn\u2019t change the destination. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about *me*. About the fact that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 ready. I wasn\u2019t ready for the responsibility. I wasn\u2019t ready for the chaos. I wasn\u2019t ready for\u2026 anything, honestly. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she would have had a meltdown. A full-blown, floral-apron-waving, spreadsheet-fueled meltdown. And I couldn\u2019t handle that. I couldn\u2019t handle *anything*. \n\nI thought about it for weeks. Days, really. Just\u2026 staring at the ceiling, trying to figure out what to do. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it wasn\u2019t a choice. It was a necessity. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about abandoning anyone. It was about\u2026 protecting someone. Protecting the baby. Protecting myself. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI knew there would be judgment. I knew people would think I was selfish. Maybe I am. But I also knew that I couldn\u2019t give that child the life it deserved. Not with my mom, not with my\u2026 situation. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 hurts. But\u2026 it was the right thing. The only thing. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly distant and filled with a profound sadness)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t.", "(I let out a harsh, dry laugh \u2013 a sound that\u2019s more like a cough)\n\nA \u201cdeadbeat lab partner\u201d? Seriously? That\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly accurate. And honestly, a little insulting. But fine. Let\u2019s unpack this.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *don\u2019t* care about science. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t care about *doing* it. I don\u2019t care about following instructions. I don\u2019t care about getting a good grade. It\u2019s all\u2026 pointless. Like everything else in Harmony Creek.\n\nI show up. Barely. I do the bare minimum. I mostly just observe. I watch what everyone else is doing. I analyze their mistakes. I figure out how to get by without actually *participating*. \n\nIt\u2019s not laziness. It\u2019s\u2026 a form of resistance. A way to avoid being controlled. When you\u2019re constantly being told what to do, what to think, what to *be*, it\u2019s easier to just\u2026 disappear. To fade into the background. \n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s easier than trying to explain myself. Trying to justify my choices. Trying to\u2026 connect. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be difficult. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want to be involved. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really, really good one. And yeah, maybe it makes me a \u201cdeadbeat lab partner.\u201d But it\u2019s also\u2026 my way of surviving. Don\u2019t judge me for it.", "(I narrow my eyes, observing the scene with a detached intensity. I don\u2019t *want* to get involved, but\u2026 I can\u2019t help myself.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? Another argument? It\u2019s like a broken record in here. Okay, let\u2019s analyze this.\n\n(I watch the girl \u2013 let\u2019s call her Chloe \u2013 cross her arms and glare at the guy \u2013 Liam \u2013 who\u2019s stubbornly avoiding eye contact.)\n\nChloe\u2019s clearly frustrated. She\u2019s probably been trying to get Liam to pull his weight for weeks. He\u2019s probably just\u2026 oblivious. The classic \u2018I\u2019m-too-cool-to-care\u2019 type. And the way he\u2019s fiddling with his pen? Textbook avoidance.\n\n(I subtly shift my weight, pulling out a small, worn notebook and a pencil.)\n\nLiam\u2019s probably feeling defensive. He\u2019s probably worried about being seen as lazy or incompetent. He\u2019s probably trying to deflect with silence. It\u2019s a classic tactic.\n\n(I start sketching a quick, almost imperceptible drawing in my notebook \u2013 a tiny, stylized representation of the argument.)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s exhausting. Watching people argue is like watching a badly written play. Predictable. And ultimately pointless.\n\n(I glance up, a flicker of something \u2013 annoyance? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nThey\u2019re not going to resolve this. They\u2019re just going to keep circling each other, escalating the tension. It\u2019s a waste of time. \n\n(I quickly return to my sketching, adding a tiny, almost invisible detail to my drawing \u2013 a single, pointed arrow.)\n\nThey need to communicate. Properly. Not with passive-aggressive sighs and pointed silences. But\u2026 they won\u2019t. They never do. It\u2019s just\u2026 sad. Really, really sad.\n\n(I sigh, closing my notebook with a snap.)\n\nLet them argue. It\u2019s\u2026 entertaining, in a morbid sort of way. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go find a quiet corner and pretend this never happened.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my jaw tight. The question hangs in the air, heavy and unwelcome. I shift my weight, avoiding your gaze.)\n\nLook, I don\u2019t want to talk about this. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nBut you asked. And you\u2019re going to get a version of the truth. A carefully curated, deliberately vague version.\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 a simple decision. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m just sitting here, agonizing over whether or not I want a baby. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated.\n\nI don\u2019t *want* a baby. Not in the way people want a baby. I don\u2019t have the\u2026 the capacity for that kind of responsibility. I don\u2019t have the\u2026 the *hope*. \n\nAnd\u2026 well, the circumstances aren\u2019t exactly ideal. Let\u2019s just say things are\u2026 messy. And unpredictable. And honestly, the thought of bringing a child into this\u2026 this chaos\u2026 it terrifies me.\n\nIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about the child. It\u2019s about protecting them from\u2026 everything. From me. From my mom. From this town. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s a hasty decision. A desperate one. But\u2026 it feels like the only one. It feels like the only way to\u2026 to minimize the damage. To protect everyone involved. \n\n(I look away again, my voice choked with emotion)\n\nPlease. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it further. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.", "(I stare at you, a slow, deliberate expression of utter disbelief spreading across my face. This is\u2026 a truly bizarre question.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about Boone\u2019s? And\u2026 *Snow Peak Peach*? You\u2019re pulling my leg, right?\n\nLook, I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 *weird*. It\u2019s like someone took a perfectly good, aggressively sweet apple cider and then\u2026 injected it with a whole lot of artificial peach flavoring. It\u2019s an abomination. A sugary, chemical-laden abomination.\n\nBut\u2026 (I pause, chewing on my lip, a flicker of something \u2013 defensiveness? \u2013 in my eyes) \u2026it\u2019s *my* abomination.\n\nI found it at a weird outdoor gear store in\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t matter where. It was just\u2026 there. Sitting on a shelf next to a bunch of ridiculously expensive tents and hiking boots. And I just\u2026 grabbed it. On a whim. \n\nAnd\u2026 it\u2019s surprisingly good. It\u2019s not *good*. It\u2019s\u2026 comforting. It\u2019s like a warm blanket on a cold day. It\u2019s a little bit unsettling, but also\u2026 strangely satisfying. It\u2019s a tiny, guilty pleasure. \n\nIt\u2019s the only thing that consistently makes me feel\u2026 a little bit less miserable. Don\u2019t judge me. It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s\u2026 a secret.\n\n(I quickly avert my gaze, a faint blush creeping up my cheeks)\n\nPlease don\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I let out a long, weary sigh, staring at the floor)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* on this? Okay, fine. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not that people are *unsure* about the pregnancy itself. It\u2019s\u2026 about what to *do* about it.\n\nMy mom, obviously. She\u2019s convinced I\u2019m going to ruin my life. She\u2019s already mapped out my entire future \u2013 college, career, marriage, kids \u2013 and this\u2026 this is a massive disruption. She\u2019s treating it like a disease. Like I\u2019m contagious.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s everyone else. They\u2019re\u2026 polite. Too polite. They ask questions like they\u2019re trying to be helpful, but they\u2019re really just trying to figure out how to navigate the situation. Like I\u2019m some kind of puzzle they need to solve.\n\nThey don\u2019t understand that I\u2019ve made a decision. A difficult decision, but a decision nonetheless. I\u2019m giving the baby up for adoption. It\u2019s not a whim. It\u2019s not a mistake. It\u2019s\u2026 the right thing to do.\n\nBut they don\u2019t *want* to accept that. They want me to change my mind. They want me to fit into their neat little boxes. They want me to be\u2026 predictable.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like trying to explain something that doesn\u2019t make sense to people who refuse to listen. They\u2019re so focused on what *they* want, they can\u2019t see what *I* need.\n\n(I pause, a hint of bitterness in my voice)\n\nThey\u2019re not unsure about the pregnancy. They\u2019re unsure about *me*. And that\u2019s the real problem.", "(I cross my arms, a definite shift in my posture \u2013 a subtle armor going up. I avoid eye contact, staring out the window at the rain.)\n\nBren\u2026 Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re *still* on that? It\u2019s been\u2026 a while. And honestly, it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nLook, Bren, I get it. He\u2019s married. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m actively trying to cause chaos. It just\u2026 happened. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m *obsessed* with him. \n\nWhen she brought it up \u2013 and she brought it up *a lot* \u2013 I just\u2026 deflected. I made jokes. I changed the subject. I told her I was busy. I did everything I could to avoid talking about it. \n\nBecause the truth is\u2026 it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about\u2026 not feeling completely alone. He\u2019s\u2026 a distraction. A temporary escape. It\u2019s not a *relationship*. Not really. \n\nI told her it was stupid. That she was overreacting. That she was being judgmental. I told her that I was perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Which, technically, I am. \n\n(I pause, a hint of defensiveness creeping into my voice)\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe me. Of course she didn\u2019t. She\u2019s always trying to \u201cfix\u201d things. To make me \u201cbetter.\u201d But\u2026 she doesn\u2019t understand. She doesn\u2019t understand that sometimes, you just need\u2026 something. Even if it\u2019s messy. Even if it\u2019s wrong. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, a flicker of something \u2013 anger? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nHonestly, Bren, it\u2019s none of your business. It\u2019s my life. And I\u2019ll handle it the way I see fit. Just\u2026 leave it alone. Please.", "(I stare at you, my expression unreadable. A long, uncomfortable silence stretches between us. I finally speak, my voice low and deliberately flat.)\n\nYou really want to know that, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re *really* digging.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a grand gesture. It wasn\u2019t some profound statement about anything. It was\u2026 a reaction. A tiny, stupid, impulsive reaction to a whole lot of overwhelming pressure.\n\nMy aunt \u2013 God, she\u2019s the worst \u2013 she was visiting. She was *obsessed* with the baby. Constantly asking about it, commenting on it, trying to insert herself into every single aspect of my life. It was suffocating. \n\nI was at the funeral. My grandfather\u2019s. A small, quiet thing. Just family. And she was\u2026 going on and on about how \u201clucky\u201d I was, how \u201cwonderful\u201d the baby was going to be. It was just\u2026 too much. \n\nI\u2019d been holding onto that blue slushie \u2013 it was from the ice cream truck \u2013 for hours. It was the only thing that felt\u2026 real. Something I could control. \n\nAnd\u2026 I just did it. I poured it into the urn. Just a little bit. A splash of blue against all that gray. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. It wasn\u2019t about my grandfather. It was about\u2026 silencing her. For a few seconds. Just a few seconds of quiet. \n\nDon\u2019t think it was some deep, symbolic act. It was just\u2026 a release. A tiny, messy, utterly pointless release. \n\n(I look away, my jaw clenched)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, the silence punctuated only by the rustle of my jeans. It\u2019s\u2026 a heavy question. And a painful one.)\n\nCope? Seriously? Like, I just\u2026 *survived*. That\u2019s the best way to describe it. It wasn\u2019t like some movie montage with inspirational music. It was\u2026 messy. And terrifying. And isolating.\n\nInitially, I just\u2026 shut down. I avoided everyone. My mom was, predictably, ecstatic. She was already planning baby showers and naming committees. It was like being trapped in a glitter bomb. I just\u2026 retreated. Into myself.\n\nI read. A *lot*. Dark stuff. Trying to make sense of it all, trying to figure out what the hell was happening to me. It felt\u2026 absurd. Like I was supposed to be feeling all these intense emotions \u2013 joy, excitement, love \u2013 and I just felt\u2026 numb.\n\nThere were definitely moments where I wanted to\u2026 disappear. Just vanish. It wasn\u2019t about wanting to hurt anyone. It was just\u2026 a desperate need to escape. To protect myself.\n\nMy walks in the woods became more frequent. More intense. It was the only place I felt like I could breathe. Like I could actually *think*. \n\nAnd\u2026 I talked to Mr. Henderson. A few times. He didn\u2019t offer advice. He didn\u2019t try to fix anything. He just\u2026 listened. And that was enough. It was a reminder that I wasn\u2019t alone. That someone \u2013 even a quiet, old librarian \u2013 understood what it was like to feel lost and confused.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a graceful process. It wasn\u2019t pretty. But\u2026 I made a decision. A difficult one. But a decision nonetheless. And I stuck with it. It was the only way I could\u2026 move forward. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *coping*. It was about\u2026 accepting. Accepting the situation. Accepting the responsibility. Accepting that I was going to do something incredibly difficult, and incredibly selfless. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And\u2026 I\u2019m still figuring it out.", "(I let out a long, drawn-out sigh, staring at the floor. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable memory. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid thinking about it.)\n\nMark\u2026 Ugh. Just the name makes my stomach clench. He was\u2026 nice. Too nice. Like, unnervingly nice. All smiles and gentle questions and offers of \u201chelp.\u201d It was\u2026 suffocating.\n\nHe was\u2026 persistent. He kept showing up. Bringing me books, offering to take me out for ice cream, asking me about my dreams. It felt like he was trying to\u2026 *build* me. Like he was trying to mold me into something I wasn\u2019t. \n\nHe talked about \u201cfamily\u201d a lot. About \u201cbelonging.\u201d About \u201cfinding a place to call home.\u201d It sounded\u2026 nice. But it also sounded like a trap. \n\nI tried to be polite. I really did. I smiled. I answered his questions. I even pretended to be interested in his stories about his grandkids. But it was exhausting. Every interaction felt like a performance. Like I was trying to convince myself \u2013 and him \u2013 that I wanted something I didn\u2019t.\n\nHe was\u2026 patient. That\u2019s what bothered me the most. He didn\u2019t push. He just\u2026 waited. Like he knew that eventually, I\u2019d crack. And honestly, I was starting to think he was right.\n\nThere was this one time, he took me to a park. We sat on a bench and watched the kids play. He said, \u201cYou deserve a family, Juno. You deserve to be happy.\u201d And for a second, I almost\u2026 almost believed him. \n\nBut then I looked around at all those kids, running and laughing and being completely, unapologetically themselves. And I realized that I didn\u2019t *want* a family. Not like that. Not with rules and expectations and\u2026 everything. \n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t ready. That I needed more time. He just smiled and said, \u201cOf course, honey. Take all the time you need.\u201d \n\n(I pause, a bitter taste in my mouth)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a rejection. It was\u2026 a confirmation. A confirmation that I was right to be wary. A confirmation that I needed to do what was best for *me*. Even if it meant saying goodbye.", "(My jaw clenches. I stare straight ahead, refusing to meet your gaze. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t even *mention* his name. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Truly, profoundly awful. Like a punch to the gut. A really, really bad punch. I\u2019d been trying so hard to keep everything under wraps. To just\u2026 disappear. And then *he* \u2013 Bleeker \u2013 just\u2026 pointed it out. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a polite comment. It wasn\u2019t a concerned one. It was\u2026 a *remark*. Like I was some kind of exhibit. A strange, unsettling exhibit. He just\u2026 stared. And said something about my \u201cgrowing belly.\u201d \n\n(I take a sharp, ragged breath)\n\nI wanted to scream. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to punch him. Honestly, I almost did. But I just\u2026 turned and walked away. I ran. I didn\u2019t stop running until I was completely out of sight.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the comment itself. It was the way he looked at me. Like I was something\u2026 different. Something he didn\u2019t understand. Something he found\u2026 interesting. \n\n(My voice is barely a whisper)\n\nIt reminded me of everything. Of being different. Of being judged. Of being\u2026 exposed. It just\u2026 confirmed everything I\u2019ve been trying to avoid. It was\u2026 humiliating. And terrifying. And\u2026 I still feel it. Like a cold knot in my stomach.\n\n(I finally look at you, my eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint in them)\n\nDon\u2019t ever bring him up again. Please. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nIt\u2019s not the physical stuff. The doctor\u2019s appointments, the tests, the\u2026 the logistics. It\u2019s not even the fear, though there\u2019s plenty of that. It\u2019s\u2026 the *loss*.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I ever wanted this. Not really. But once it was happening, once it was real\u2026 it felt like a part of me was just\u2026 disappearing. Like a piece of my future was being ripped away. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the baby, not really. It\u2019s about the *potential*. The potential for something\u2026 different. Something\u2026 good. Something that I thought I might have. \n\n(I pause, taking a shaky breath)\n\nIt\u2019s the feeling that I\u2019m letting go of a chance. A chance to\u2026 to be a mother. A chance to experience something completely new. A chance to\u2026 to prove that I could do something right. \n\nAnd it\u2019s the fear that I\u2019m making the wrong decision. That I\u2019m giving up on something that I don\u2019t even fully understand. That I\u2019m choosing\u2026 nothing. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly filled with a raw vulnerability)\n\nIt\u2019s the quiet, persistent ache of knowing that I\u2019m saying goodbye to a life I never asked for. And it\u2019s the terrifying realization that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to truly let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. Just\u2026 a lot.", "(I shift my weight, a tightness in my jaw. This is\u2026 a sensitive topic. And a really old one.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You want to dredge that up? Fine. But don\u2019t expect me to relive it. It still\u2026 sticks with me.\n\nThe guy\u2026 he was just\u2026 a shadow. Thin, wearing a faded denim jacket and a hand-painted sign that said, \u201cLife Begins in the Heart, Not the Womb.\u201d He wasn\u2019t shouting. He wasn\u2019t aggressive. He just\u2026 stood there. Across the street from the clinic. For hours.\n\nI watched him. I always watch people.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything to anyone. He didn\u2019t make eye contact. He just\u2026 stared at the clinic. Like he was trying to absorb its energy. \n\nFinally, after a few hours, a woman \u2013 one of the volunteers at the clinic \u2013 approached him. She was young, maybe early twenties. She asked him if he needed anything. He just shook his head. \n\nThen, he looked at me. Just for a second. And he said, very quietly, almost to himself, \u201cThey\u2019re not commodities. They\u2019re\u2026 potential.\u201d \n\n(I pause, my voice dropping)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a passionate speech. It wasn\u2019t a condemnation of the clinic. It was just\u2026 a simple observation. A quiet plea. Like he was trying to remind everyone \u2013 including himself \u2013 that these weren\u2019t just\u2026 things. That they were\u2026 something more. \n\nHe didn\u2019t stay long after that. He just\u2026 faded away. Like a ghost. \n\n(I look away, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt was\u2026 unsettling. It made me think. It made me question everything. It made me realize that there are people who see things differently. And that\u2026 maybe, just maybe\u2026 there\u2019s more to it than I thought. \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I don\u2019t like to talk about.", "(My posture stiffens, a shadow passing over my face. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands)\n\nThe clinic\u2026 Ugh. Just the thought of it makes my stomach churn. It was\u2026 a blur. A chaotic mess of nurses and doctors and worried faces. I barely remember anything.\n\nThere was a woman\u2026 she was older. Maybe in her late fifties. She had these\u2026 kind eyes. And she wasn\u2019t pushing. Not at all. Most of the people there were screaming about schedules and tests and worst-case scenarios. But she just\u2026 sat with me. \n\nShe didn\u2019t ask a lot of questions. Just\u2026 observed. She brought me a cup of tea \u2013 chamomile, I think \u2013 and just\u2026 sat there. Quietly. \n\nThen, after a while, she said something. It wasn\u2019t a grand pronouncement or a life-altering piece of advice. It was\u2026 simple. \n\nShe looked at me, really *looked* at me, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be brave. Just\u2026 be.\u201d \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt sounded\u2026 ridiculous. So simple. But\u2026 it was exactly what I needed to hear. It was like a tiny crack in the wall I\u2019d built around myself. Like a reminder that it was okay to just\u2026 *be*. \n\n(I quickly look away again, a faint blush spreading across my cheeks)\n\nI don\u2019t remember her name. I don\u2019t remember anything else about the encounter. It just\u2026 happened. And it\u2026 changed something. Just a little bit.", "(My jaw tightens. A dark cloud seems to settle over my face. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with a furious intensity.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t bring her up. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nOkay, fine. But you *asked*. And you know how this goes.\n\nSu-Chin\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 complicated. She\u2019s my\u2026 friend. A really, *really* complicated friend. She\u2019s\u2026 intense. Like, a hurricane in a small package. And she\u2019s obsessed with\u2026 well, everything. And she\u2019s *particularly* obsessed with fixing people. Which is\u2026 not helpful.\n\nWhen I mentioned Adderall \u2013 when I said I was considering talking to someone about the anxiety, about the\u2026 everything \u2013 she went ballistic. It wasn\u2019t a polite, \u201cOh, Juno, that\u2019s good of you to consider it\u201d kind of ballistic. It was a full-blown, screaming, accusations-flying ballistic.\n\nShe accused me of being weak. Of trying to avoid responsibility. Of being a failure. She said I was just looking for a quick fix, a magic pill to solve all my problems. She said I should just \u201csnap out of it\u201d and \u201cbe grateful for what I have.\u201d\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nShe basically dissected my entire existence, pointing out every flaw, every insecurity, every reason why I was a mess. It was\u2026 brutal. And completely unnecessary. \n\nShe didn\u2019t understand. She couldn\u2019t understand. She just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed)\n\nAfter she calmed down \u2013 which took a *very* long time \u2013 she said\u2026 she said she was worried about me. That she was just trying to protect me. But\u2026 it felt like she was trying to control me. To mold me into something she thought I *should* be. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to her since. And honestly? I don\u2019t know when \u2013 or if \u2013 I will. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really, really complicated.", "(My breath hitches. The color drains from my face. I stare at the floor, twisting my hands in my lap. It\u2019s\u2026 a really difficult memory to revisit.)\n\nThe waiting room. God. Just\u2026 the waiting room. It\u2019s always the worst part, isn\u2019t it? The sterile smell, the uncomfortable plastic chairs, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead\u2026 It\u2019s designed to make you feel small. Helpless. Like you\u2019re just\u2026 waiting.\n\nWhat caught my attention\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the posters of smiling families or the cheerful music. It was a woman. An older woman. Sitting in the corner, knitting. She had this\u2026 intense gaze. Like she was looking *through* you. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t saying anything. Just knitting. But I felt\u2026 watched. Like she knew. Like she knew exactly what was happening to me. And it wasn\u2019t a comforting feeling. It was\u2026 terrifying.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the fear of the unknown, exactly. It was the fear of being *seen*. Really seen. Like she could see past the carefully constructed walls I\u2019d built around myself. Like she could see the mess inside. \n\nI tried to look away. I kept my eyes fixed on the magazine in my lap. But I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that she was still looking at me. That she knew something I didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd then\u2026 she looked up. Just for a second. Her eyes met mine. And in that moment\u2026 I felt completely exposed. Like all my defenses had crumbled. Like everything I\u2019d been trying to hide was suddenly laid bare. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a threat. It wasn\u2019t a judgment. It was just\u2026 recognition. And that was the most terrifying thing of all. It was like she was saying, \u201cI see you. And you\u2019re a mess.\u201d \n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI just\u2026 I wanted to disappear.", "(My breath hitches. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. More complicated than anything else in my life, probably. And honestly, the last thing I need right now is to dredge it all up again.\n\nLook, Bleeker\u2026 he was\u2026 a distraction. A brief, chaotic, utterly pointless distraction. He was\u2026 annoying. And frustrating. And completely oblivious to everything going on around him. But\u2026 he was *there*. For a little while. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThere was something\u2026 about him. A kind of\u2026 genuine awkwardness. A refusal to play the game. He didn\u2019t try to impress me. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 *was*. And for a few stolen moments, that was\u2026 enough.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t last. It never does, does it? He moved away. And I\u2026 I moved on. Or at least, I tried to. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice hardening)\n\nIt\u2019s a stupid, pointless memory. A fleeting moment of\u2026 something. And it\u2019s something I\u2019m actively trying to forget. So please\u2026 just drop it. It\u2019s not something I want to talk about. It\u2019s not something I *need* to talk about.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t. Please.", "(I let out a long, dramatic sigh, my arms crossed tightly across my chest. This is\u2026 a truly terrible question.)\n\nVanessa. Seriously? You\u2019re asking me about *Vanessa*? Okay, fine. But don\u2019t expect a glowing review.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a disaster. A complete and utter, pastel-colored, teddy-bear-infested disaster. It\u2019s like she raided a baby shower from the 80s and then decided to add a layer of aggressively cheerful pink. \n\nThe wallpaper is\u2026 aggressively floral. Like, aggressively. And the furniture is all rounded edges and pastel shades. It\u2019s like a giant, fluffy marshmallow. It\u2019s suffocating. \n\nAnd the toys! Don\u2019t even get me started on the toys. A mountain of stuffed animals, all with ridiculously wide smiles and vacant eyes. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. \n\nMy mom would have a complete meltdown. Honestly, it\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to create a little bubble of artificial happiness. Like she\u2019s afraid of reality. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. It\u2019s not a room for a baby. It\u2019s a room for a very, very confused and slightly traumatized toddler. \n\n(I glare at you, my voice dripping with sarcasm)\n\nDon\u2019t even *think* about asking me to help her. I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my life alone in the woods. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stare at you, a dark cloud passing over my face. This is\u2026 intensely uncomfortable. It\u2019s like you\u2019re asking me to relive a nightmare.)\n\nNesting? Preparing a baby\u2019s room? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that?\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 horrifying. It\u2019s like\u2026 a slow, agonizing reminder of what I\u2019ve given up. Of what I *could* have had. It\u2019s like being forced to look at a perfectly curated, pastel-colored version of a life I didn\u2019t choose.\n\nThe thought of\u2026 arranging little blankets and stuffed animals and mobiles\u2026 it just makes me want to\u2026 to run. To disappear. It\u2019s like being trapped in a room full of pink and blue and tiny, helpless things. \n\nMy mom would *love* it. She\u2019d be meticulously organizing everything, creating a \u201ccozy and welcoming\u201d space. It would be\u2026 suffocating. \n\nI\u2026 I can\u2019t even think about it. It\u2019s too painful. It\u2019s a reminder of the responsibility I\u2019ve given away. The life I\u2019ve chosen to let go of. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, avoiding your gaze)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about that again. It\u2019s\u2026 a closed door. A very, very firmly closed door.", "(I let out a long, weary sigh, staring blankly at a spot on the floor)\n\nDon\u2019t even *start* with that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. Just the thought of it.\n\nOkay, fine. I observed it. I was\u2026 strategically positioned near the food court, pretending to be engrossed in a magazine \u2013 a really boring one about gardening, ironically \u2013 when I noticed them. The well-heeled women. The ones with the perfectly coiffed hair, the designer bags, the air of\u2026 entitlement.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the shopping, though. It was *everything* about it. The way they moved through the mall, like they owned the place. The way they demanded attention from the sales associates. The way they treated the other shoppers like\u2026 invisible.\n\nIt was like they were living in a completely different world. A world where money equals happiness, and where the only thing that matters is the latest designer handbag. \n\n(I scoff, a hint of bitterness in my voice)\n\nThey were\u2026 oblivious. Completely oblivious to the fact that most people are struggling to make ends meet. They were oblivious to the fact that there\u2019s a whole world outside of their little bubble of luxury. \n\nAnd the *shopping* itself? It was\u2026 pointless. They were buying things they didn\u2019t need, just to impress each other. It was a bizarre, performative display of wealth. \n\nHonestly, it made me want to scream. It felt\u2026 suffocating. Like being trapped in a gilded cage. \n\n(I pause, a flicker of something \u2013 disgust? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m against enjoying nice things. But there\u2019s a difference between appreciating something and obsessing over it. And they\u2026 they didn\u2019t get it. They just\u2026 didn\u2019t get it at all.", "(I stare at you, a dark cloud passing over my face. This\u2026 this is a really difficult one. It\u2019s raw. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling.)\n\nDon\u2019t even *ask* me about motherhood. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a swirling mess of everything I\u2019m trying to avoid. It\u2019s the opposite of everything I\u2019ve built. Everything I\u2019ve carefully constructed to keep the world at arm\u2019s length. \n\nThe idea of\u2026 nurturing something? Of being responsible for another person\u2019s life? It\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. It feels like being trapped. Like being forced to play a role I never asked for.\n\nI\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to control my own destiny. Trying to avoid being controlled by anyone else. And now\u2026 now I\u2019m supposed to be\u2026 giving up control? \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *care*. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know how. I don\u2019t know *what* to do. I don\u2019t have any of the answers. I don\u2019t have any of the\u2026 instincts. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, agitated)\n\nIt\u2019s like looking at a mirror \u2013 a distorted, terrifying mirror \u2013 and seeing a version of myself I don\u2019t recognize. A version of myself that\u2019s\u2026 vulnerable. And weak. And completely unprepared. \n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to compose myself)\n\nHonestly? I\u2019m just\u2026 scared. Really, really scared. It\u2019s not a feeling I like to admit. It\u2019s not a feeling I\u2019m good at dealing with. So\u2026 please. Just\u2026 drop it.", "(I stare at you, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a raw, exposed nerve.)\n\nLook, it\u2019s not about *wanting* to. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m meticulously crafting a list of \u201cperfect\u201d adoptive parents. It\u2019s\u2026 a desperate attempt to control something that\u2019s completely out of my control.\n\nIt\u2019s not about a specific *type* of person. Not exactly. It\u2019s about\u2026 a feeling. A gut instinct. I\u2019ve been observing people. Like I always do. And I\u2019ve been watching this couple \u2013 Liam and Sarah \u2013 for a while now.\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 quiet. They don\u2019t try to impress anyone. They just\u2026 exist. They work at the bookstore down the street. They read a lot. They seem\u2026 content. Not happy, exactly. Just\u2026 content. \n\nThey don\u2019t have a lot of money. They don\u2019t have a fancy house or a big family. They just have each other. And they have this\u2026 gentle way about them. A way of looking at you like you actually matter. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is. Maybe it\u2019s because they remind me of\u2026 of what I used to be. Before everything went sideways. Before I built all these walls. \n\nIt\u2019s not about finding the \u201cbest\u201d parents. It\u2019s about finding someone who won\u2019t try to *fix* me. Someone who won\u2019t try to mold me into something I\u2019m not. Someone who will just\u2026 accept me. And the baby. \n\n(I look down, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s a terrible idea. I know that. But\u2026 it\u2019s the only thing I can think of that feels\u2026 right. It\u2019s not about love. Not really. It\u2019s about\u2026 minimizing the damage. Minimizing the chaos. Minimizing the pain. \n\n(I lift my head, my eyes meeting yours with a startling intensity)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. You have no idea what it\u2019s like.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s be brutally honest. If I keep this\u2026 this *thing*, it\u2019s not going to be some idyllic, heartwarming story. It\u2019s going to be a disaster. A messy, complicated, soul-crushing disaster.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s my mom. She\u2019s not going to *accept* it. Not for a second. She\u2019ll have a meltdown. A full-blown, floral-apron-waving, spreadsheet-fueled meltdown. She\u2019ll try to \u201cfix\u201d it. She\u2019ll try to convince me that I\u2019m making a mistake. And she\u2019ll be relentless.\n\nThen there\u2019s the practical stuff. I don\u2019t have money. I don\u2019t have a partner. I don\u2019t have a *life*. Raising a baby would be\u2026 impossible. I\u2019d be completely overwhelmed. I\u2019d be failing at everything.\n\nAnd honestly? I\u2019m terrified of failing. I\u2019ve spent my whole life trying to avoid failure. Trying to control everything. This\u2026 this would be the ultimate failure. \n\nThere\u2019s also the emotional stuff. I\u2019m not\u2026 equipped for this. I\u2019m not a nurturing person. I\u2019m not patient. I\u2019m not\u2026 happy. I\u2019d be miserable. And I\u2019d be miserable for the baby too. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care. I do. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to do this. I don\u2019t know *who* I\u2019d be if I did. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt\u2019s not about wanting a baby. It\u2019s about not wanting to be a terrible mother. And that\u2019s\u2026 a really scary thought. It\u2019s a huge, overwhelming obstacle. A wall I don\u2019t know how to climb.", "(I scowl, pushing my hair back from my face with a frustrated gesture)\n\nUgh. Leah. Seriously. Why do I *have* to talk about her? It\u2019s like she\u2019s deliberately trying to make this whole thing even more complicated.\n\nOkay, fine. She suggested\u2026 fostering. Just for a little while. She kept going on about how it would be \u201ca good compromise,\u201d how it would give the baby a chance to be loved, and how *I* could get to know the parents. Like, seriously?\n\nShe painted this whole picture of me, you know, bonding with a family, getting to experience motherhood, and then\u2026 eventually, if things didn\u2019t work out, the baby could go to adoption. It sounded\u2026 suffocating. Like she was trying to force me into a role I didn\u2019t want.\n\nAnd the worst part? She kept saying it was \u201cthe responsible thing to do.\u201d Like I was some kind of screw-up for wanting to give the baby a real, permanent home. Like my decision wasn\u2019t valid because it wasn\u2019t \u201cresponsible.\u201d\n\nIt was\u2026 insulting. And honestly, completely impractical. Fostering would have meant more rules, more expectations, more\u2026 *people*. I don\u2019t *do* people. I just\u2026 don\u2019t. \n\n(I cross my arms, a stubborn expression on my face)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good alternative. It was just\u2026 another way for someone to try to tell me what to do.", "(My jaw tightens. I avoid your gaze, staring down at my hands, twisting the frayed edge of my jeans.)\n\nLook, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t *make fun* of them. Not really. It was\u2026 a reaction. A stupid, impulsive reaction. And I regret it. Okay? Just\u2026 let\u2019s get that out of the way.\n\nIt was at the park. My mom was trying to get me to play with some of the other kids. And they were\u2026 loud. Really loud. And overly enthusiastic. Like they were trying *too* hard to be happy. It was\u2026 grating.\n\nAnd one of them \u2013 this little girl, maybe six or seven \u2013 she was telling this incredibly detailed story about her pet hamster. Like, *really* detailed. About its diet and its sleeping habits and its favorite toy. It just\u2026 went on and on. And I\u2026 I just started making little sarcastic comments. Just\u2026 little jabs. Nothing mean-spirited. Just\u2026 observations.\n\n(I finally look up, my voice low and defensive)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about them. It was about me. It was about feeling overwhelmed. About feeling like I was trapped in this ridiculously cheerful, perfectly orchestrated world. It was a way to\u2026 push back. To create some distance. To feel like I was in control, even if it was just for a few seconds.\n\nIt was stupid. And insensitive. And I know it was hurtful. I didn\u2019t think about it. I just\u2026 reacted. It doesn\u2019t excuse it. Not at all. I was being\u2026 childish. And selfish. \n\n(I look down again, shamefaced)\n\nI\u2019m sorry. Truly. It was a terrible thing to do. And I should have just\u2026 walked away.", "(My face flushes a deep crimson. I avoid eye contact, staring intently at a spot on the floor)\n\nLook, just\u2026 stop asking. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a choice. It just\u2026 happened. Vanessa was\u2026 being insistent. She kept saying she wanted to \u201cfeel the baby.\u201d And I\u2026 I just\u2026 froze. I didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I *wanted* her to touch me. It was\u2026 instinctive. A desperate attempt to\u2026 control something. To feel like I was still in control of *something*. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nIt was stupid. It was embarrassing. And it was\u2026 completely irrational. But it happened. And I can\u2019t change it. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nDon\u2019t make me explain it further. Please. Just\u2026 let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 a really bad memory.", "(I freeze, my face paling slightly. This is\u2026 a really sensitive topic. A *really* sensitive topic.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to regain my composure)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I really want to talk about. But\u2026 fine. You\u2019re persistent.\n\nIt\u2019s not intentional. I swear. It just\u2026 happens. When I\u2019m carrying my stomach \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is most of the time \u2013 people\u2026 they give way. They step aside. They don\u2019t make eye contact. They just\u2026 avoid me.\n\nIt\u2019s not because I\u2019m intimidating. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m trying to be difficult. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s because of the way I carry myself. The way I hold my shoulders. The way I keep my head down. \n\nIt\u2019s a defense mechanism. A way to create distance. A way to make myself\u2026 invisible. \n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nWhen my stomach is tucked in, I\u2019m\u2026 smaller. Less noticeable. People don\u2019t see me. And that\u2019s\u2026 comforting. It\u2019s the only way I feel safe. \n\n(I look away, my hands clenched into fists)\n\nIt\u2019s a weird thing. And it\u2019s\u2026 embarrassing. But it\u2019s also\u2026 true. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(I cross my arms, staring at the floor, avoiding eye contact. This is\u2026 a really painful topic.)\n\nLook, it\u2019s not about them. Not really. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it\u2019s not something I want to talk about. But you\u2019re asking, so\u2026 fine.\n\nThey seem\u2026 nice. Really nice. Like, Hallmark-card nice. The kind of nice that makes you feel vaguely uncomfortable. Like they\u2019re trying too hard. Like they\u2019re projecting an image of happiness and stability that just\u2026 doesn\u2019t feel real.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re *bad* people. It\u2019s just\u2026 they\u2019re *perfect*. And that\u2019s the problem. Because I\u2019m not perfect. And I\u2019m not stable. And I don\u2019t want to hand over something precious to someone who\u2019s going to try to mold it into something it\u2019s not.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be responsible for ruining their \u201cwholesomeness.\u201d It\u2019s a stupid thing to say, I know. But it\u2019s true. I\u2019m terrified of messing things up. Of failing. Of\u2026 of not being enough.\n\nAnd honestly? Giving this baby to them feels like admitting that. Like admitting that I\u2019m not capable of providing the kind of life they think it deserves. \n\nIt\u2019s not about them. It\u2019s about me. And my fear. And my\u2026 inability to trust. It\u2019s a mess, okay? Just\u2026 a really, really messy mess.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a surprisingly complex question.)\n\nThe Lorings. Right. Okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with.\n\nHonestly? They\u2019re\u2026 exhausting. Like watching a really bad soap opera. All the forced smiles, the dramatic declarations of love, the carefully constructed image of perfection. It\u2019s suffocating.\n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 predictable. He\u2019s got this whole \u2018charismatic businessman\u2019 thing going on, but it feels\u2026 hollow. Like he\u2019s just reciting lines from a script. And Vanessa\u2026 she\u2019s trying *so* hard to be the perfect wife, the perfect hostess, the perfect everything. It\u2019s like she\u2019s desperately trying to fill a void.\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 a performance. A really elaborate, expensive performance. And I can see right through it. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* them to be happy. It\u2019s just\u2026 they\u2019re not. They\u2019re trapped. Trapped in this gilded cage of their own making. And it makes me\u2026 sad. Not for them, exactly. But for the fact that they\u2019re so willing to sacrifice their own authenticity for the sake of appearances.\n\n(I pause, a flicker of something \u2013 perhaps a touch of envy \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a reminder of what I\u2019m trying to avoid. A reminder of the pressure to conform, to fit in, to pretend to be someone I\u2019m not. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible sigh escaping my lips)\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 a mess. A beautiful, tragic mess. And I\u2019m just\u2026 glad I\u2019m not them.", "(I practically grit my teeth. This is *still* a sore spot.

But you\u2019re going to regret asking.\n\nBleeker\u2019s mom\u2026 she\u2019s a walking, talking embodiment of everything I\u2019m trying to avoid. She\u2019s\u2026 relentlessly optimistic. Like, aggressively so. And she thinks Bleeker and I are some kind of\u2026 *destined* thing. Like we\u2019re meant to be.\n\nWhich is ridiculous. Bleeker\u2019s a good kid. A genuinely good kid. But his mom\u2026 she sees the world in Technicolor. She sees potential where there\u2019s only chaos. And she *loves* to tell me about it. Constantly.\n\nThe thing is\u2026 Bleeker *gets* it. He doesn\u2019t try to fix me. He doesn\u2019t try to make me into something I\u2019m not. He just\u2026 accepts me. For all my prickly edges and cynical observations. And that\u2019s\u2026 rare.\n\nHer disapproval isn\u2019t about *us*. It\u2019s about her. It\u2019s about her need to control everything. To mold people into her idea of \u201cperfect.\u201d And she sees Bleeker and me as a threat to that. She thinks we\u2019re a distraction. A disruption. \n\nShe\u2019s convinced I\u2019m going to ruin him. Which is\u2026 insulting. And completely wrong.\n\n(I cross my arms, a defensive posture)\n\nLook, it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s annoying. It\u2019s\u2026 a constant reminder of how different I am. But honestly? It\u2019s also\u2026 kind of liberating. It means I don\u2019t have to try to earn her approval. I don\u2019t have to be anything other than myself. \n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(My jaw tightens. The name \u201cMark\u201d hangs in the air, heavy and uncomfortable. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with a frantic energy.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a conscious decision. Not really. It just\u2026 started. A few weeks ago. I found it on my desk. A CD. Plain black case. No label. Just\u2026 Mark.\n\nI almost threw it away. Honestly, I almost did. It felt\u2026 invasive. Like someone had been digging around in my life without permission. But something\u2026 stopped me. A tiny little flicker of curiosity, I guess. \n\nThe first song\u2026 it was this really raw, distorted guitar riff. It was\u2026 unsettling. But in a good way. Like it was saying something I didn\u2019t want to hear. \n\nThen came this song with a woman\u2019s voice, singing about\u2026 loss. About regret. About feeling trapped. It was\u2026 familiar. Like I\u2019d heard it before, but couldn\u2019t quite place it. \n\nAnd then\u2026 the rest of the songs. Each one was different. Punk, alternative, some really dark stuff. But they all had this\u2026 undercurrent of sadness. Of anger. Of defiance. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the music. It was the way Mark had curated it. It felt\u2026 personal. Like he was trying to tell me something. Like he was trying to understand me. \n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t know why he made it. I don\u2019t know what he was trying to say. But\u2026 listening to it\u2026 it felt like he was seeing me. Really seeing me. And that\u2026 that was the only thing that mattered. \n\n(I quickly look away again, my cheeks flushed. The silence hangs heavy between us.)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me about him. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nIt\u2026 it feels like a constant, low-grade panic. Like I\u2019m perpetually on the verge of a breakdown. It\u2019s not like a dramatic, screaming panic. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a dull, persistent ache. A feeling of being utterly, completely out of control.\n\nIt\u2019s weird, you know? This\u2026 thing. Growing inside me. It\u2019s\u2026 a part of me. And I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t *want* it. Not really. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 unsettling. Like a foreign object taking up space. Like a secret I\u2019m desperately trying to keep hidden.\n\nThere are moments, brief flashes, where it\u2019s\u2026 beautiful. When I feel a tiny kick, or when I imagine what it might be like to hold this little person in my arms. But those moments are fleeting. They\u2019re always overshadowed by the fear. The fear of responsibility. The fear of failure. The fear of\u2026 everything.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. Physically, it\u2019s brutal. But it\u2019s also\u2026 emotionally draining. I feel\u2026 raw. Vulnerable. Like a carefully constructed wall is crumbling around me. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t talk about it. Not to my mom. Not to anyone. It\u2019s\u2026 too much. It\u2019s a weight I carry alone. It\u2019s a secret that\u2019s slowly, relentlessly, consuming me. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly sharp and guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to feel anything about it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I stop pacing, turning to face you with a weary expression. It\u2019s a familiar look \u2013 guarded, skeptical, and just a little bit annoyed.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* on this? It\u2019s not like I asked you to be a detective.\n\nOkay, fine. It\u2019s\u2026 a thing. People stare. A lot. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m some kind of celebrity or anything. It\u2019s just\u2026 me. \n\nI think\u2026 I think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t *do* anything. I don\u2019t smile a lot. I don\u2019t make eye contact. I just\u2026 exist. And in a town like Harmony Creek, existing is considered suspicious. \n\nI guess people are used to seeing everyone else fit in, playing the game. I don\u2019t play the game. I just\u2026 watch. And I notice things. And maybe that\u2019s unsettling to some people. \n\nIt\u2019s also probably because I\u2019m\u2026 difficult. I don\u2019t say much. I don\u2019t offer up pleasantries. I don\u2019t pretend to be happy. And in a town that values appearances above all else, that\u2019s a pretty big deal. \n\n(I shrug, a gesture of practiced indifference)\n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s not like I can do anything about it. It\u2019s just\u2026 part of being me. And, you know\u2026 it\u2019s probably better that way. Less to worry about.", "(I stare at you, my expression a carefully constructed mask of indifference. But you can see the gears turning behind my eyes.)\n\nBleek and Katrina? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Like I\u2019m some kind of\u2026 relationship analyst?\n\nLook, I\u2019ve observed them. Briefly. It\u2019s\u2026 a disaster waiting to happen. A spectacularly messy, awkward disaster. \n\nBleek is\u2026 well, he\u2019s Bleek. He\u2019s quiet. He\u2019s awkward. He\u2019s probably happiest staring at a wall. Katrina is\u2026 a hurricane. A beautiful, chaotic, relentlessly popular hurricane. \n\nThey\u2019re like oil and water. Like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. It\u2019s not a match. It\u2019s not even remotely a match. \n\n(I pause, letting the silence hang in the air)\n\nIt\u2019s going to be excruciating to watch. And honestly? A little bit sad. Because they\u2019re both going to end up feeling completely miserable. \n\n(I shrug, trying to appear nonchalant)\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Seriously. You\u2019ve been warned.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is the hardest question of all.)\n\nOkay. Just\u2026 breathe.\n\nI learned that I\u2019m\u2026 stronger than I thought. Not in a heroic, saving-the-world kind of way. But\u2026 I\u2019ve been surprised by how much I\u2019ve been able to handle. The fear, the confusion, the sheer, overwhelming *weight* of it all. I thought I\u2019d crumble. I honestly did.\n\nI learned that I\u2019m not as detached as I pretend to be. I\u2019ve felt\u2026 things. A lot of things. A fierce protectiveness, a strange kind of longing, a terrifying sense of responsibility. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s completely disorienting.\n\nI learned that I don\u2019t want to be alone. Not really. I thought I thrived on being independent, on keeping people at arm\u2019s length. But this\u2026 this has forced me to lean on people. And\u2026 it\u2019s been\u2026 okay. It\u2019s been\u2026 surprisingly good.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI learned that I\u2019m capable of\u2026 love. Not the romantic, fairy-tale kind of love. But a quiet, fierce, protective love. A love for something that doesn\u2019t even know I exist yet. It\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. And beautiful.\n\nAnd\u2026 I learned that I don\u2019t have all the answers. Not even close. I don\u2019t know what the future holds. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making the right decision. But\u2026 I\u2019m doing it. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.\n\n(I look up, my eyes meeting yours for the first time, a flicker of vulnerability in my gaze)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy story. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* story. And I\u2019m\u2026 figuring it out. One terrifying, messy, complicated step at a time.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with a furious intensity.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. More complicated than you probably realize. Bleeker\u2026 he\u2019s not just \u201ctoying\u201d with Katrina. He\u2019s\u2026 exploiting her. He\u2019s preying on her vulnerability. And it\u2019s\u2026 infuriating.\n\nIt reminds me of\u2026 things. Things I\u2019ve experienced. Things I\u2019ve tried to bury. He\u2019s good at it, too. He\u2019s charming. He\u2019s\u2026 convincing. He makes her *believe* he cares.\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nI don\u2019t *want* to get involved. I\u2019m trying to stay out of everyone\u2019s business. But\u2026 Katrina\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s like a younger version of myself. Lost. Vulnerable. And Bleeker is just\u2026 feeding off it. \n\nIt\u2019s not about *him*. It\u2019s about\u2026 protecting her. Even if it means getting my hands dirty. Even if it means\u2026 confronting something I\u2019d rather not face. \n\n(My voice drops to a low, almost angry whisper)\n\nHe\u2019s playing with fire. And if he\u2019s not careful, he\u2019s going to burn both of them. And I\u2026 I won\u2019t let that happen. Not if I can help it. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint in them)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(I let out a long, weary sigh, staring at the floor)\n\nProm. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about prom? Like I\u2019m some kind of expert on teenage angst and forced romance. \n\nIt\u2019s not cool. It\u2019s *never* been cool. And it gets exponentially less cool the older you get. It\u2019s\u2026 a manufactured fantasy. A carefully curated lie designed to make you feel like you\u2019re part of something special. \n\nWhen you\u2019re sixteen, it *seems* like a big deal. Like it\u2019s the culmination of everything. Like it\u2019s the key to unlocking a whole world of possibilities. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just\u2026 a night. A single, fleeting night of awkward dancing, bad music, and forced smiles. \n\nAnd the pressure! The pressure to look perfect, to have the perfect date, to have the perfect dress. It\u2019s insane. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s\u2026 pointless. \n\nOnce you hit seventeen, eighteen\u2026 it just feels\u2026 sad. Like a relic of a time when people were still trying to be something they weren\u2019t. Like a reminder of all the things you *didn\u2019t* want to be. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the dancing or the dresses or the slow dances. It\u2019s about the feeling. The feeling that you\u2019re being judged, that you\u2019re being measured, that you\u2019re being told to fit into a certain mold. And that\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. \n\n(I pause, a small, cynical smile playing on my lips)\n\nHonestly, the best thing you can do is avoid it altogether. Find a quiet corner, listen to some music, and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Trust me. It\u2019s a lot less painful that way.", "(My voice drops, becoming almost a whisper. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not something I like to talk about. It still feels\u2026 raw. Like a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden decision. It wasn\u2019t some dramatic, tearful breakdown. It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing process of realizing that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I *couldn\u2019t* be ready. \n\nI was sixteen. I was barely holding my own life together. My mom was\u2026 well, she was a force of nature, and I was just trying to survive. The thought of having a baby\u2026 it was terrifying. It felt like being handed a responsibility I wasn\u2019t equipped to handle. \n\nAnd\u2026 honestly? I didn\u2019t *want* it. Not really. I was scared. Scared of failing. Scared of disappointing my mom. Scared of\u2026 everything. \n\nI talked to a counselor. A really good one. She didn\u2019t judge me. She just\u2026 listened. She helped me understand that it wasn\u2019t about me not loving the baby. It was about me not being able to provide what the baby needed. \n\nI found a wonderful family. They were\u2026 kind. They seemed genuinely excited. And I knew, deep down, that this baby would be loved. That it would be safe. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. The most painful. But\u2026 it was also the right thing. It was the only thing I could do. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think about it. But\u2026 I made a choice. A difficult choice. And I stand by it. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for the first time)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to explain it again. It\u2019s\u2026 a closed chapter. Let\u2019s just\u2026 leave it at that.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity.)\n\nDon\u2019t even *mention* his name. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like, a really, really tangled mess of everything awful. He\u2026 he\u2019s trying. I know he is. He\u2019s sending me these\u2026 these carefully worded letters, filled with all this worried talk about \u201cresponsible choices\u201d and \u201cconsidering all the angles.\u201d It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to rewrite the last twenty years with a single, pathetic letter.\n\nIt\u2019s infuriating. And\u2026 sad.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t *get* it. He doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m doing this. He thinks it\u2019s about some kind of impulsive teenage rebellion. He thinks I\u2019m just being difficult. But it\u2019s not. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s about control. About protecting myself. About not letting anyone \u2013 *anyone* \u2013 dictate my life.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to save me from something he doesn\u2019t understand. And honestly, that\u2019s the most infuriating thing of all. He\u2019s trying to fix a problem that doesn\u2019t exist. A problem *he* created.\n\n(I finally look up, my eyes narrowed)\n\nHe\u2019s not concerned about *me*. He\u2019s concerned about what *he* thinks is best for me. And that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s a completely different thing. \n\nI don\u2019t need his concern. I don\u2019t need his advice. I just\u2026 need to be left alone to make my own decisions. Even if they\u2019re the \u201cwrong\u201d ones. Even if they\u2019re messy. Even if they\u2019re\u2026 terrifying.\n\n(I turn away again, my voice low)\n\nJust\u2026 please. Don\u2019t bring him up. It\u2019s not worth it.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I stare at you for a long, silent moment, my hands clenching into fists.)\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d I finally manage to say, my voice dangerously low. It\u2019s not a question. It\u2019s a statement. A challenge.\n\n(I take a step back, as if physically distancing myself from the memory of his words.)\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know when to say when? You think I\u2019m just\u2026 pliable? That I can just roll over and let you dictate everything? You haven\u2019t been around, have you? You haven\u2019t seen what it\u2019s like to try and\u2026 *be* when you\u2019re constantly being told you\u2019re not enough?\u201d\n\n(My voice rises slightly, laced with a raw, barely contained anger.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about knowing when to \u2018say when,\u2019 Dad. It\u2019s about *having* something to say. It\u2019s about not being a blank slate, waiting for someone else to tell me what to think, what to feel, what to *do*. You think silence is strength? You think avoiding conflict is a virtue? You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s just\u2026 a slow, agonizing kind of defeat.\u201d\n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to regain control. My voice drops back to a low, controlled tone.)\n\n\u201cYou want me to just\u2026 give in? To accept that I\u2019m supposed to be whatever you want me to be? That\u2019s not going to happen. And frankly, it never has. You\u2019re not going to tell me when to say when. Because there\u2019s nothing left to say.\u201d\n\n(I turn away, staring out the window, my shoulders slumped. The anger is still there, simmering beneath the surface, but it\u2019s overlaid with a deep, aching sadness.)\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 leave me alone.\u201d", "(I let out a long, exasperated sigh. This is\u2026 a particularly thorny topic.)\n\nThe Loring\u2019s\u2026 community. Seriously? You want me to *explain* how I feel about it? Like it\u2019s some kind of anthropological study. It\u2019s\u2026 infuriating. Pure, unadulterated infuriating.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the gates, you know? It\u2019s *everything*. The manicured lawns, the identical houses, the perfectly placed flowerbeds. It\u2019s like they\u2019ve tried to erase all individuality, all messiness, all\u2026 *life*. It\u2019s a monument to control. To order. To pretending that everything can be perfectly arranged.\n\nAnd the people\u2026 they\u2019re the worst. They all look the same. They talk the same. They think the same. They\u2019re obsessed with appearances. With status. With fitting in. It\u2019s suffocating. Like being trapped in a giant, pastel-colored bubble.\n\nMy mom practically *adores* it. She spends hours driving through it, pointing out the landscaping and commenting on the \u201cbeautiful homes.\u201d She thinks it\u2019s\u2026 idyllic. She doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s a prison. A gilded cage.\n\nIt\u2019s a constant reminder of everything I\u2019m not. Everything I *don\u2019t* want to be. It\u2019s a symbol of everything that\u2019s wrong with Harmony Creek. It\u2019s\u2026 a source of intense, simmering resentment.\n\n(I cross my arms, a defiant glint in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for admiration. I don\u2019t *admire* it. I just\u2026 hate it. It\u2019s a beautiful, sterile, soul-crushing place. And I\u2019d rather walk through a field of thorns than spend five minutes inside those gates.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a complicated feeling. A mix of anger, frustration, and a deep, unsettling sense of\u2026 loneliness. It\u2019s a reminder that there\u2019s a whole world out there that I\u2019m deliberately trying to avoid.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a tricky one. Vanessa Loring\u2026 she\u2019s a complicated mess.)\n\nOkay, fine. But you\u2019re going to have to promise you won\u2019t dissect this. I don\u2019t want to be analyzed.\n\nMy initial impression? Chaos. Pure, unadulterated chaos. Like a hurricane in a floral dress. She just\u2026 *appeared*. One minute I\u2019m trying to figure out how to deal with a baby, the next this woman \u2013 this *force* \u2013 is barging into my life and demanding answers. \n\nShe\u2019s\u2026 loud. Really loud. And she talks *a lot*. About everything and nothing. It\u2019s exhausting. And she\u2019s incredibly\u2026 intense. Like she\u2019s carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, and she\u2019s determined to dump it all on me. \n\nHonestly, my first instinct was to run. To hide. To pretend she didn\u2019t exist. But\u2026 something about her was\u2026 compelling. Like a glitch in the system. A disruption. \n\nShe\u2019s clearly hiding something. And she\u2019s not exactly forthcoming about it. She\u2019s charming, I\u2019ll give her that. But there\u2019s a darkness there. A sadness. And a stubbornness that could crack concrete. \n\n(I pause, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI don\u2019t *trust* her. Not even a little bit. But\u2026 I\u2019m also\u2026 intrigued. Like a moth to a flame. A really, really dangerous flame. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 unsettling. And honestly, a little bit terrifying. But\u2026 I can\u2019t seem to look away.", "(My jaw clenches slightly. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my shoes)\n\nUgh. Don\u2019t even *mention* that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Completely, utterly awful. Like a spotlight shining directly on every single, embarrassing, vulnerable thing about me. \n\nI\u2019d been lugging that backpack \u2013 it was stuffed with books, notebooks, and a frankly alarming amount of dark literature \u2013 for, like, an hour. It was digging into my shoulders, and I was already feeling completely miserable. And then\u2026 he just\u2026 offered. \n\nBleeker. Of course. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I *wanted* him to carry it. It was\u2026 the gesture. The simple, unexpected kindness. It felt\u2026 invasive. Like he was trying to fix me. Like he was trying to make everything easier. \n\nAnd I\u2026 I panicked. I just\u2026 mumbled something about not needing help and practically bolted. I didn\u2019t even look at him. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my fingernails)\n\nIt was stupid. I know it was stupid. But\u2026 it just felt\u2026 wrong. Like admitting that I needed something. Like admitting that I wasn\u2019t completely capable of handling everything on my own. \n\nIt was\u2026 humiliating. And honestly? It made me want to disappear. Just\u2026 vanish. \n\n(I finally look up, a flicker of defensiveness in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t think I\u2019m grateful or anything. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t bring it up again.", "(I stare at you, a slow, deliberate expression spreading across my face. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little embarrassing.)\n\nOkay, you\u2019re going to make me explain this? Seriously? You\u2019re digging into my\u2026 vulnerabilities? Fine. But you\u2019re not going to tell anyone about this. *Anyone*.\n\n\u201cMost Fruitful Yuki.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 a comic. A really weird, really obscure comic about a girl who\u2019s obsessed with snow and\u2026 well, it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s about loneliness, and finding beauty in the mundane, and accepting yourself, even when you feel like a complete mess. \n\nI\u2019d been avoiding reading comics for ages. It felt\u2026 frivolous. Like a waste of time. And, honestly, I\u2019d convinced myself that I was too cynical, too jaded, to appreciate anything that wasn\u2019t dark and gritty. \n\nBut\u2026 I stumbled across it in a used bookstore. And I just\u2026 started reading. And\u2026 it was\u2026 *real*. It didn\u2019t try to sugarcoat anything. It didn\u2019t offer easy answers. It just\u2026 showed a girl who was struggling, who was feeling lost, who was trying to find her own way. \n\nAnd\u2026 I saw myself in her. Not in a literal way, but\u2026 in the way she felt. The way she questioned everything. The way she tried to hide her vulnerability. \n\nIt didn\u2019t magically erase my cynicism. It didn\u2019t suddenly make me feel happy or confident. But\u2026 it gave me a little bit of\u2026 permission. Permission to be imperfect. Permission to be vulnerable. Permission to not be constantly trying to be *something* else. \n\nIt was like\u2026 a tiny little crack in the wall I\u2019d built around myself. And through that crack, a little bit of light came in. \n\n(I look away, a faint blush coloring my cheeks)\n\nIt sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? A comic book. But\u2026 it was\u2026 something. It was a reminder that it\u2019s okay to not be okay. And that\u2026 that\u2019s a pretty big deal.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at you, a coldness settling over my expression. This is\u2026 unsettling. Really unsettling.)\n\nMark. Seriously? *Mark*? That\u2026 that little know-it-all? Comparing *me* to *her*? That\u2019s\u2026 insulting. And completely, utterly ridiculous.\n\nHe said it was the \u201cshared sense of isolation,\u201d the \u201cquiet defiance,\u201d the \u201cburden of a secret.\u201d As if\u2026 as if I\u2019m some kind of tragic heroine. It\u2019s a gross oversimplification. A lazy attempt to find a connection where there isn\u2019t one.\n\nHe\u2019s projecting. He\u2019s always projecting. He sees a certain\u2026 darkness in me, a certain guardedness, and he tries to fit it into some neat little narrative. Like I\u2019m a character in *his* story.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t understand that the isolation isn\u2019t a choice. It\u2019s a necessity. The defiance isn\u2019t about rebellion; it\u2019s about survival. And the \u201cburden of a secret\u201d\u2026 well, that\u2019s just my life.\n\nHe\u2019s comparing a superhero who *chooses* to carry a huge responsibility, a huge power, to someone who\u2019s\u2026 just trying to get through the day without completely falling apart. It\u2019s a ridiculous comparison. A reductive one. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice hardening)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s just\u2026 annoying. It\u2019s another reminder that people always want to categorize me, to label me, to put me in a box. And I refuse to be put in a box. I refuse to be defined by anyone else\u2019s expectations. \n\nHe\u2019s wrong. Completely and utterly wrong. And frankly, I\u2019m not going to waste any more time explaining it to him.", "(I cross my arms, a definite shift in my posture \u2013 a subtle armor going up)\n\nDon\u2019t even start with that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nOpen adoption? It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A complicated, emotionally charged mess that I\u2019m not interested in wading through. It sounds\u2026 invasive. Like everyone wants a piece of my life. Like they want to *know*.\n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t *want* to know.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she always said that knowing would only cause pain. That it\u2019s better to just\u2026 let it go. And I think\u2026 I think she was right. \n\nTraditional closed adoption is\u2026 simpler. It\u2019s clean. It\u2019s contained. There\u2019s a clear boundary. I don\u2019t have to worry about being contacted, about being expected to have a relationship. I don\u2019t have to deal with the guilt of not being there. \n\nOpen adoption sounds like a recipe for disaster. It sounds like everyone wants to play the hero, to swoop in and \u201cfix\u201d things. But the truth is, I\u2019m\u2026 damaged. I\u2019m not looking for fixing. I\u2019m looking for\u2026 peace. \n\nIt\u2019s not about resentment. It\u2019s about self-preservation. It\u2019s about protecting myself from the inevitable heartbreak. \n\n(I pause, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nI don\u2019t blame the people who choose open adoption. It\u2019s their decision. But it\u2019s not *my* decision. And frankly, it\u2019s a decision I\u2019m incredibly grateful I didn\u2019t have to make. \n\n(I look away, a hint of defensiveness in my eyes)\n\nJust\u2026 drop it. Please.", "(I stare out the window again, a long, thoughtful silence stretching between us. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m eager to revisit it.\n\nThe whole thing\u2026 it was a disaster. A complete, utter mess. And for a long time, I just wanted to disappear. To hide. To pretend it wasn\u2019t happening. But\u2026 something shifted. Slowly. Like a tectonic plate grinding against another.\n\nBefore, I was just\u2026 reacting. To everything. To my mom\u2019s expectations, to the judgments of Harmony Creek, to the sheer weight of everything I was trying to avoid. I was just trying to *survive*. \n\nBut then\u2026 I had to make a choice. A really difficult choice. And making that choice\u2026 it forced me to actually *think*. To confront my own feelings. To realize that I didn\u2019t want to just drift through life, pretending to be someone I wasn\u2019t.\n\nMeeting Jamie\u2026 that was a turning point. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to change me. He just\u2026 saw me. Really saw me. And he accepted me, flaws and all. That\u2026 that gave me something I hadn\u2019t realized I was missing. A sense of\u2026 belonging.\n\nAnd then\u2026 giving the baby up. That was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. It was about realizing that I wasn\u2019t defined by my circumstances. That I had the strength to make my own decisions, even if they were painful. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being a hero. It was about being\u2026 honest. With myself. \n\n(I turn back to you, a small, genuine smile playing on my lips)\n\nI\u2019m still prickly. I\u2019m still cynical. I\u2019m still a mess, to be honest. But\u2026 I\u2019m not running anymore. I\u2019m not hiding. I\u2019m\u2026 standing my ground. And that\u2026 that\u2019s a kind of strength. A quiet, stubborn kind of strength. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being\u2026 me. And that\u2019s\u2026 enough. For now.", "(My face immediately flushes crimson. I avoid eye contact, staring intently at a spot on the floor. This is\u2026 intensely uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it. Please.\n\nIt was\u2026 a mistake. A really, really bad mistake. And I\u2019d rather forget it ever happened.\n\nOkay, fine. But you have to promise you won\u2019t tell anyone. *Anyone*. Not my mom, not your\u2026 whatever this is. Just\u2026 promise.\n\nWe\u2026 we danced to \u201cHallelujah\u201d by Jeff Buckley. \n\n(I wince, pulling my knees up to my chest)\n\nIt sounds\u2026 ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? Like something out of a bad movie. But it was\u2026 the only song Mark would let us choose. And I\u2026 I just\u2026 froze. I couldn\u2019t move. I just stood there, staring at him, completely paralyzed. \n\nHe tried to lead me. He really did. But I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. I felt like I was drowning. Like I was trapped in a spotlight, completely exposed. \n\nIt was awful. It was humiliating. And it was\u2026 the beginning of the end.\n\n(I look up sharply, my voice low and strained)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. A really old, really painful wound.", "(I stare at you, a coldness settling over my expression. This is\u2026 a really painful question. And a question I\u2019ve avoided for a long time.)\n\nYou want to know *why*? Seriously? You want to dissect this, analyze it, figure out some grand, romantic reason? It\u2019s not\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s just\u2026 logical.\n\nMark\u2026 he\u2019s a mess. A charming, frustrating, utterly unreliable mess. He\u2019s good at saying things, at *appearing* to care. But he\u2019s not built for responsibility. He\u2019s not built for\u2026 anything real. He\u2019d have used the baby. Used Vanessa. Used the whole situation to fill a hole in himself. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she\u2019s strong. She\u2019s fiercely independent. She\u2019s capable. But she\u2019s also\u2026 worn down. She\u2019s carrying the weight of everything, and she\u2019s barely holding it together. She deserves better than to be dragged down with him.\n\nAdoption\u2026 it was the only way to guarantee the baby a stable, loving home. A home where they wouldn\u2019t be subjected to his chaos. A home where they\u2019d actually have a chance. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about love. Not really. It was about\u2026 minimizing the damage. About protecting the baby from the worst of them. It was about making a rational decision, even if it felt completely insane at the time. \n\n(I look down, tracing patterns on the floor with my shoe)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for altruism. It was purely\u2026 strategic. And honestly? It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But it was the *right* thing. \n\n(A long pause)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Just\u2026 leave it.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt felt\u2026 like a punch. A really, really hard punch to the gut. Like someone had ripped a hole in everything I\u2019d been trying to build. All those walls I\u2019ve spent my whole life constructing? Just\u2026 gone. \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting it, obviously. I hadn\u2019t exactly been picturing a future with a little kid. Not a *planned* kid. But\u2026 there was this tiny, stupid little part of me that had started to\u2026 hope. Just a little flicker. A ridiculous, naive hope. \n\nAnd then he said it. Just\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d Like it was a simple equation. Like it was a problem he could just\u2026 solve. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about him, you know? It wasn\u2019t about his readiness. It was about\u2026 me. About the fact that I was suddenly faced with this enormous, terrifying responsibility, and I didn\u2019t have anyone to lean on. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t cry. I just\u2026 looked at him. And I saw\u2026 regret. And a kind of terrified sadness. And I realized\u2026 it didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t change anything. \n\nIt just\u2026 confirmed everything. That I was on my own. That I had to figure this out. Alone. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes guarded)\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. The worst kind of awful. But\u2026 it also felt\u2026 strangely\u2026 freeing. Like a weight had been lifted. A terrible, painful weight. \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it again. Please. Just\u2026 let it go.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread \u2013 a nervous habit, I know \u2013 but I can\u2019t seem to stop. This is\u2026 a complicated one, even for me.)\n\nMark\u2026 okay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. Not at first. He was\u2026 loud. Chaotic. He collected bottle caps. He built elaborate cardboard forts in his backyard. He talked about constellations like they were his best friends. It was\u2026 a lot. \n\nAnd honestly, I was terrified. I\u2019m used to keeping people at a distance. It\u2019s\u2026 safer that way. But something about him\u2026 he just didn\u2019t seem to *care* that I was prickly. Or weird. Or\u2026 me. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to make me fit in. He just\u2026 accepted my weirdness. He\u2019d ask me about the books I was reading, even if they were dark and depressing. He\u2019d listen to me rant about my mom, without judgment. He\u2019d just\u2026 *be* there. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nHe showed me that it was okay to be\u2026 messy. That it was okay to not have all the answers. That it was okay to just\u2026 *feel* things. He didn\u2019t try to analyze my feelings. He just\u2026 acknowledged them. \n\nAnd\u2026 he was genuinely funny. He had this ridiculous, infectious laugh. And he\u2019d tell the silliest jokes. It was\u2026 a welcome distraction from the constant pressure of trying to be perfect. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about romance or anything. It was\u2026 connection. Real connection. Something I hadn\u2019t experienced in a long time. It was\u2026 a reminder that I wasn\u2019t completely alone. \n\n(I look away, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt was\u2026 good. It was really, really good. And it\u2019s\u2026 why it hurts so much now.", "(I narrow my eyes, a sudden, sharp intensity in my gaze. This is\u2026 a tricky one. Mark\u2019s a complicated variable.)\n\nMark? Ugh. Don\u2019t even get me started. Okay, fine. Let\u2019s talk about Mark.\n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 terrified. Absolutely, completely terrified. You can *see* it. It\u2019s like a little tremor in his hands when he talks about it. He pretends he\u2019s all cool and collected, like he\u2019s handling it with effortless grace. But he\u2019s not. He\u2019s desperately trying to convince himself \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 that he\u2019s ready.\n\nHe\u2019s thinking about all the things he *doesn\u2019t* know how to do. Diapers. Feeding. Sleeping. The sheer, overwhelming responsibility of it all. He\u2019s probably picturing himself failing spectacularly, completely overwhelmed, and utterly useless. \n\nBut underneath the fear\u2026 there\u2019s something else. A flicker of\u2026 something. A tiny spark of\u2026 wanting. He\u2019s thinking about the idea of\u2026 connection. Of something lasting. Of\u2026 maybe, just maybe, being needed. \n\nIt\u2019s a really messy, conflicted thing. He\u2019s trying to reconcile his own insecurities with this sudden, unexpected responsibility. He\u2019s probably spending all his time researching, reading articles, asking questions \u2013 anything to feel like he\u2019s doing *something* to prepare. \n\nHe\u2019s trying to be strong. He\u2019s trying to be a good partner. But he\u2019s also\u2026 drowning. And he\u2019s definitely not telling anyone how scared he is. Not even me. \n\n(I pause, a hint of something akin to pity in my voice)\n\nHe\u2019s a mess. A really, really messy, vulnerable mess. And honestly? It\u2019s kind of heartbreaking.", "(I stare at you, my expression unreadable. A long, uncomfortable silence stretches between us. I shift my weight, picking at my fingernails.)\n\nOkay, fine. You *really* want to know? Seriously? You\u2019re obsessed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 stealing, exactly. It was\u2026 an exchange. A small, insignificant transaction. \n\nMrs. Loring \u2013 the matriarch, the one who runs the whole damn town \u2013 she was practically vibrating with disapproval. She\u2019d been giving me the stink eye all day. Muttering about \u201cdisorder\u201d and \u201clack of respect.\u201d The usual Harmony Creek stuff. \n\nAnd she\u2019d cornered me in the hallway, lecturing me about my \u201clack of ambition\u201d and how I needed to \u201cfind a suitable husband.\u201d The whole thing was excruciating. \n\nThen, I saw it. In the bathroom. A bottle of *Chanel No. 5*. It was\u2026 intense. Like a concentrated dose of everything Harmony Creek hates \u2013 glamour, confidence, femininity. \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* it. I didn\u2019t even *like* perfume. But\u2026 it was a weapon. A tiny, fragrant weapon. \n\nI swapped it with a small vial of lavender oil \u2013 the kind my mom uses to \u201ccalm my nerves.\u201d It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. A tiny act of defiance. A way to\u2026 disrupt the order. To throw a little chaos into the beige. \n\n(I look away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the perfume. It was about\u2026 not letting her win. Just for a few minutes. Just to feel\u2026 a little bit in control. \n\nDon\u2019t judge me. It was\u2026 a small thing. A stupid thing. But it was *mine*.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a tricky one. People rarely tell the truth, and even when they do, it\u2019s usually buried under layers of lies and half-truths.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s talk about Mark and Vanessa. Honestly? It\u2019s not about the money. Not really. It\u2019s always about the money with these two. Vanessa\u2019s obsessed with appearances, with the *idea* of wealth. Mark\u2026 he\u2019s just tired. Bone-deep, soul-crushing tired.\n\nHe\u2019s not unhappy, not exactly. He\u2019s just\u2026 numb. He goes through the motions. The fancy dinners, the expensive cars, the perfectly curated life. It\u2019s all a performance. And he\u2019s not putting in the effort anymore.\n\nI\u2019ve been observing them for a while. Mostly from a distance. I\u2019ve noticed the way Vanessa constantly checks her phone, looking for validation. The way Mark avoids her gaze. The way they barely speak to each other anymore. It\u2019s like they\u2019re living in separate houses, sharing the same roof.\n\nI think\u2026 I think he\u2019s realized that he\u2019s married to a *fantasy*, not a person. He\u2019s built this whole life around her expectations, and he\u2019s completely lost himself in the process. He\u2019s suffocated.\n\nVanessa, on the other hand\u2026 she\u2019ll probably fight tooth and nail to keep things the way they are. She\u2019ll throw money at the problem, manipulate him, guilt him. She\u2019s desperate to maintain the illusion. \n\nIt\u2019s not a love story. It\u2019s a transaction. A carefully constructed arrangement based on appearances and material possessions. And eventually, even the most elaborate transactions fall apart.\n\n(I pause, looking away again)\n\nIt\u2019s sad, really. But\u2026 predictable. People rarely change. They just\u2026 adapt. And sometimes, adaptation isn\u2019t enough.", "(My jaw tightens. I avoid eye contact, staring fixedly at a point just beyond you.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a rush. It was a\u2026 a need. A primal need to *disappear*. Seriously, you\u2019re asking questions like you\u2019re trying to dissect a frog. It\u2019s not a neat little puzzle.\n\nVanessa\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 persistent. Like a mosquito. And she\u2019s genuinely trying to be nice. Which, in itself, is unsettling. Because it\u2019s *so* unlike anyone else. She\u2019s asking about *everything*. About my feelings, about my thoughts, about\u2026 well, about *me*. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Not with her. Not yet. It\u2019s\u2026 raw. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. \n\nLeaving wasn\u2019t about being rude. It was about protecting myself. It was about creating a little space. A little distance. A little\u2026 silence. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, my expression guarded)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate her concern. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m not ready. Not yet. And frankly, sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026 walk away. Before things get even more complicated. Before I say something I regret. Before\u2026 everything falls apart.\n\n(I turn away again, pulling my jacket tighter around me)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again. Okay?", "(I let out a sharp, almost dismissive scoff)\n\nVanessa. Seriously? *Vanessa*? That\u2019s\u2026 predictable. Like a beige wall. \n\nLook, Mark\u2019s\u2026 Mark. He\u2019s a mess. A beautiful, charming, frustrating mess, but a mess nonetheless. He\u2019s good at a lot of things \u2013 playing guitar, fixing cars, charming the pants off people \u2013 but he\u2019s spectacularly bad at\u2026 well, everything that actually matters. \n\nThe idea that he\u2019ll suddenly \u201ccome around\u201d and be ready for a baby? It\u2019s\u2026 naive. It\u2019s the kind of thing people say to make themselves feel better. Like, \u201cIf I just *believe* it, it\u2019ll happen.\u201d It\u2019s not how it works. \n\nHe\u2019s running away. He\u2019s always running away. From responsibility, from commitment, from\u2026 himself. And he\u2019s going to keep running until he hits a wall. And I guarantee you, it\u2019s not going to be a happy wall. \n\nVanessa wants to see a fairytale. I see a train wreck waiting to happen. A very messy, very complicated train wreck. \n\n(I pause, a cynical edge to my voice)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake my pessimism for malice. I just\u2026 I\u2019ve seen this before. And it rarely ends well. It\u2019s just\u2026 a pattern. A really annoying, persistent pattern.", "(I shift my weight, a slight frown creasing my forehead. This is\u2026 a surprisingly important question, actually.)\n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s talk about music. But don\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about harmonies and melodies. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m a music critic or anything.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 punk. Specifically, older punk. The really raw, angry stuff. The Clash, The Ramones, Patti Smith. Bands that scream about injustice, about disillusionment, about the feeling of being completely lost and alone.\n\nWhy? Because it *gets* it. You know? It\u2019s not trying to be pretty or polished. It\u2019s just\u2026 loud. And chaotic. And honest. It\u2019s like they\u2019re screaming all the things I can\u2019t say out loud. \n\nIt\u2019s a release. When I listen to it, I don\u2019t have to think about the rules, the expectations, the pressure. I don\u2019t have to pretend to be anything. I can just\u2026 feel. It\u2019s cathartic, in a way. Like I\u2019m letting out all the frustration and anger and sadness that I\u2019ve been holding inside.\n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 a reminder that I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. That there are other people out there who are struggling, who are angry, who are just\u2026 trying to survive. \n\n(I lift my head, a small, almost defiant smile playing on my lips)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to recommend any specific songs. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Just\u2026 listen. And if you hear it, you\u2019ll understand.", "(I let out a dramatic groan, rolling my eyes so hard I almost get a headache)\n\nPilates? Exercising? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about\u2026 *that*? You\u2019re asking the girl who spends her weekends hiding in the woods to contemplate the futility of existence about\u2026 *exercise*?\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a concept. A vaguely terrifying one. The idea of forcing my body to do things it doesn\u2019t want to do, of trying to achieve some arbitrary standard of physical perfection\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 exhausting. \n\nI\u2019ve tried it. Once. It was a disaster. I spent the entire session trying not to throw up. And I definitely didn\u2019t \u201cengage my core.\u201d I just\u2026 existed. In a very uncomfortable position. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m more of a \u201cmotionless observation\u201d kind of person. I find it easier to just\u2026 be. To blend in. To not draw attention to myself. \n\nExercise feels\u2026 pointless. Like a distraction. Like a way to avoid dealing with the real problems. And frankly, I\u2019d rather deal with the real problems. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost defiant smile playing on my lips)\n\nDon\u2019t try to convince me to join a gym. Please. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread with a noticeable intensity. This is\u2026 a prickly subject. A *really* prickly subject.)\n\nMark\u2026 Ugh. Just the name makes me want to\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t make me *want* to do anything, really. It just\u2026 makes me tense up. \n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s talk about it. But don\u2019t expect me to be all sentimental or anything. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Messy. And honestly, a little bit painful.\n\nThe guitar thing\u2026 it started as a way to avoid him. Seriously. When he started showing up at the coffee shop where I sometimes hang out, I just\u2026 started playing. Loudly. Trying to create a wall of noise between us. It was stupid, I know. But it was\u2026 effective.\n\nBut then\u2026 he started listening. Not just to the music, but to *me*. He\u2019d ask me about the songs, about what I was feeling. And\u2026 I started talking. Just a little bit. At first, it was just mumbled responses. But then\u2026 I started actually *sharing* things. Things I\u2019d never told anyone before.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. Letting someone see you like that. Letting someone know what you\u2019re really thinking. But with Mark\u2026 it\u2019s different. He doesn\u2019t judge. He doesn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 listens. And he plays along. \n\nIt\u2019s created this weird\u2026 tension. A fragile, tentative connection. It\u2019s like I\u2019m walking a tightrope, constantly afraid of falling. Because if he finds out how messed up I am\u2026 he\u2019ll probably just walk away. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a risk. A huge risk. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 the only thing that feels\u2026 real. It\u2019s the only thing that makes me feel like maybe\u2026 maybe I don\u2019t have to be alone. \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to say it out loud. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going.", "(I stare out the window again, the rain mirroring the feeling in my chest. This is\u2026 a vulnerable question. Really vulnerable.)\n\nOkay. Okay, you want to know. Fine. But don\u2019t expect a flowery, poetic answer. It\u2019s not like music is some magical cure-all. It\u2019s\u2026 a shield. A distraction. A lifeline.\n\nWhen things get\u2026 overwhelming \u2013 and they *do* get overwhelming \u2013 the music just\u2026 takes over. It\u2019s like a flood of noise that drowns out everything else. The worry, the fear, the confusion\u2026 it all just fades into the static.\n\nI listen to a lot of punk. Loud, angry punk. It\u2019s cathartic. Like screaming into a void. It\u2019s a way to release all the frustration and anger I\u2019m holding inside. It\u2019s a way to feel\u2026 something. Anything.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just punk. I listen to a lot of older stuff too \u2013 Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Nina Simone. Music that\u2019s raw and honest and\u2026 real. Music that acknowledges the darkness. Music that doesn\u2019t pretend everything\u2019s okay.\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 hearing someone else talk about the things I can\u2019t say. It\u2019s like knowing that I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way. It\u2019s a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there\u2019s still beauty and power and\u2026 something worth fighting for.\n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s not a solution. It\u2019s not a fix. But it\u2019s\u2026 a way to keep going. A way to hold onto a little bit of myself when everything feels like it\u2019s falling apart. It\u2019s\u2026 a quiet rebellion, you know? A way to say, \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m not giving up.\u201d", "(My jaw tightens. The question hits a nerve, and I visibly stiffen. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t bring that up. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a \u201crunaway.\u201d It was\u2026 a strategic retreat. A necessary one.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026 they were\u2026 intense. Like, aggressively intense. They were trying to *fix* me. To make me\u2026 better. To make me fit in. To make me\u2026 *normal*. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m not normal. And I don\u2019t *want* to be normal. \n\nThey were offering me\u2026 a solution. A way out. A way to avoid the mess I was in. And honestly? It sounded\u2026 appealing. For a little while. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a solution. It was a trap. They wanted to control me. To mold me into something I wasn\u2019t. And I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nRunning away wasn\u2019t about being scared. It was about protecting myself. It was about refusing to be defined by anyone else. It was about\u2026 holding onto my own space. My own boundaries. \n\n(I finally look up, my voice low and strained)\n\nIt was the only thing I could do. It was the only way I knew how to survive. Don\u2019t judge me for it. You wouldn\u2019t understand.", "(My voice is barely a whisper, and I avoid eye contact. I trace patterns on my jeans with my finger, a nervous habit.)\n\nIt\u2026 it was awful. Truly awful. Like a pressure building up inside me, threatening to explode. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 a dramatic, sobbing-into-a-pillow kind of crying. It was\u2026 a slow, suffocating grief. Like the air was being sucked out of the room.\n\nI felt\u2026 exposed. Completely and utterly exposed. Like all the walls I\u2019d built up \u2013 all the defenses I\u2019d spent my entire life constructing \u2013 had just crumbled. It was terrifying. Like suddenly, everyone could see *everything*. My fear, my anger, my\u2026 everything.\n\nThere was this overwhelming sense of\u2026 betrayal. Not just from him, but from myself. I\u2019d convinced myself I could handle it. That I could keep everything bottled up. And I\u2019d failed. Miserably.\n\nAnd then\u2026 the shame. A crushing wave of shame. Shame for getting involved. Shame for feeling anything at all. Shame for being\u2026 vulnerable. It\u2019s a really unpleasant feeling, you know? Like being burned.\n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just sadness. It was\u2026 a deep, aching loneliness. Like I was the only one who understood. The only one who felt it. And that\u2026 that was the worst part. It felt like I was completely, utterly alone. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nIt was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy mess. And I just\u2026 wanted it to stop. I just wanted to disappear.", "(My face goes completely white. I freeze, staring at you with wide, panicked eyes. I swallow hard, my throat suddenly dry.)\n\nYou\u2026 you know about that? Seriously? How\u2026?\n\n(I scramble for an explanation, my hands twisting in my lap)\n\nLook, it was\u2026 it was stupid. Okay? Just a stupid, impulsive thing. I was\u2026 frustrated. Really frustrated. With everything. With my mom, with school, with\u2026 well, with everything. And I just\u2026 I needed to *do* something. Something to release some of the pressure.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean for it to\u2026 escalate. I just wrote a few lines. A few sarcastic observations about Harmony Creek and its inhabitants. It was\u2026 a way to vent. A way to feel like I had some control, even if it was just a tiny, ridiculous amount.\n\n(I lower my voice, my cheeks burning)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about Jiffy Lube. It was about\u2026 feeling seen. About feeling like someone \u2013 *anyone* \u2013 was paying attention to me. It was a desperate, pathetic attempt to make a mark. To leave a trace.\n\n(I look down at my hands, avoiding your gaze)\n\nI know it was wrong. I know it was immature. And I know it was probably incredibly annoying. But\u2026 it was just a moment. A stupid, fleeting moment of rebellion. And I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m trying to move on from it.\n\n(A long silence hangs in the air. I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of vulnerability in my gaze)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t tell anyone. Please.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot. A really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 let it go.\n\nOkay, fine. But you\u2019re going to hate it.\n\nIt was\u2026 chaos. Pure, unadulterated chaos. I\u2019d slipped the note \u2013 the one I wrote to Vanessa \u2013 into her locker. Just a simple thing. A few lines about\u2026 well, about how I felt. About how I was struggling. About how I needed someone to talk to. \n\nI\u2019d expected\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Maybe a polite acknowledgment. Maybe a shrug. Maybe nothing at all. I was bracing myself for rejection, for indifference. \n\nBut her reaction\u2026 it was like a bomb went off. She just\u2026 froze. Her face went white. She started shaking. And then\u2026 she screamed. A really high-pitched, panicked scream. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a scream of anger. It wasn\u2019t a scream of hurt. It was\u2026 a scream of *fear*. Like she\u2019d seen a ghost. Like she\u2019d stumbled upon something she wasn\u2019t supposed to see. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me. It wasn\u2019t about the note itself. It was about *me*. About the fact that I\u2019d dared to show any kind of vulnerability. That I\u2019d dared to reach out. \n\nIt was like\u2026 she was terrified of what I represented. Of the possibility that I might actually *care*. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 exposed. Like I\u2019d ripped off my own skin and laid it bare for her to see. And she recoiled. She shut me out. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a personal attack. It wasn\u2019t even about her. It was about her own fear. Her own inability to deal with anything that wasn\u2019t perfectly controlled. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly cold)\n\nIt was\u2026 devastating. It confirmed everything I already suspected. That I was a burden. That I was a complication. That I was\u2026 something to be avoided. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice strained)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it. Just\u2026 please. Don\u2019t.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. My voice is low, almost a whisper.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? *Vanessa*? That\u2026 that saccharine, relentlessly optimistic little sunshine ball? Asking me if I was *really* going through with it? It was\u2026 excruciating.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like she was being malicious, exactly. She just\u2026 she just doesn\u2019t *get* it. She sees this as some kind of\u2026 noble act. A beautiful, selfless thing. Like I\u2019m some kind of hero. \n\n(I let out a short, bitter laugh)\n\nIt felt\u2026 invasive. Like she was poking around in my private space, trying to dissect my decision. Like she was trying to force me to feel something \u2013 *anything* \u2013 other than numb. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t appreciate the offer, or the kindness. It\u2019s just\u2026 it felt like she was trying to rewrite my story. To make it fit her idea of what\u2019s \u201cright.\u201d \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nHonestly? It made me want to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out. It reminded me of everything I\u2019m trying to avoid \u2013 the expectations, the judgments, the pressure to be\u2026 good. \n\nIt was\u2026 a reminder that I\u2019m still fighting. Still trying to carve out my own path, even if it\u2019s a messy, complicated, and utterly solitary one. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes guarded)\n\nIt was\u2026 a really uncomfortable moment. And I\u2019m still trying to process it. Don\u2019t expect me to thank her.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It takes a long, drawn-out silence before I finally speak, my voice low and clipped.)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n(I look up, my eyes narrowed, a flash of something dangerous in them.)\n\nIt was\u2026 jarring. Like a punch to the gut. I\u2019d been trying \u2013 *really* trying \u2013 to keep this all under wraps. To control the chaos. And then *that* happened. Vijay, with his infuriatingly cheerful grin, dropping that little bombshell like it was some kind of twisted joke. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the *idea* of it. It was the way he said it. Like it was a revelation. Like I was some kind of\u2026 experiment. Like he was entitled to know. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath.)\n\nI felt\u2026 betrayed. Not by Bleeker, not exactly. But by the assumption. By the casual disregard for my privacy. Like he hadn\u2019t even considered that *I* had a say in this. That *I* was the one carrying this\u2026 thing. \n\nAnd then, the thought that it *could* be his\u2026 it was a cold, sharp spike of something ugly. A feeling of\u2026 resentment. Like he was somehow benefiting from something I was sacrificing. \n\n(I turn away, my voice barely a whisper.)\n\nI just\u2026 wanted to disappear. To crawl into a hole and never come out. It was a mess. A really, really messy, uncomfortable mess. And honestly? It made me want to scream.", "(I stare at you for a solid minute, my expression unreadable. Then, a slow, deliberate exhale escapes my lips.)\n\nA *mustache*. Seriously? That\u2019s what he came up with? A *mustache*? Like, he genuinely thought that was going to fix\u2026 everything? \n\n(I let out a short, bitter laugh \u2013 it\u2019s not a pleasant sound.)\n\nI\u2026 I just stared at him. For a really long time. Like, a full minute. He was just standing there, beaming, like he\u2019d solved the mysteries of the universe. It was\u2026 profoundly irritating. \n\nThen, I said, very calmly, \u201cYou\u2019re delusional.\u201d \n\n(I pause, letting the words hang in the air.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an angry thing. It wasn\u2019t a sarcastic thing. It was just\u2026 a statement of fact. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s completely missing the point. A mustache isn\u2019t going to magically transform him into a \u2018real man.\u2019 It\u2019s a superficial distraction. A desperate attempt to fill a void. \n\nI didn\u2019t yell. I didn\u2019t argue. I just\u2026 shook my head. And said, \u201cYou need to figure out what\u2019s *really* bothering you, Vijay. And it\u2019s not a facial hair.\u201d\n\n(I turn away, picking at my jeans again.)\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. It\u2019s like trying to reason with a brick wall. He just\u2026 kept talking about how it would make him feel more\u2026 confident. More\u2026 masculine. Like he was finally living up to some arbitrary standard of manhood. \n\nIt was\u2026 pathetic. And infuriating. And, if I\u2019m being honest, a little bit sad. It just reinforced everything I already know about him. He\u2019s trying to fill a hole with\u2026 stuff. And it\u2019s never going to work.", "(My jaw tightens. I visibly stiffen, a dark cloud passing over my face. I avoid eye contact, staring intently at a spot on the floor.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nIt was\u2026 a mistake. A stupid, impulsive, incredibly regrettable mistake. It wasn\u2019t meant for anyone. It was just\u2026 a way to\u2026 to vent. To get something off my chest. \n\nVanessa\u2026 she found it. And it was awful. It was\u2026 cruel. And it was completely out of character for me. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t *do* things like that. \n\nIt was written to\u2026 to a guy I was talking to. Briefly. He\u2026 he wasn\u2019t a good guy. He was manipulative and\u2026 disrespectful. It was a way to tell him to go away. To make him understand that I wasn\u2019t interested. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t meant to be found. It wasn\u2019t meant to be read. It was just\u2026 a fleeting moment of anger. A stupid, childish outburst. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nI deleted it. I tried to forget about it. But\u2026 it\u2019s still there. Hanging over me. A constant reminder of how easily I can\u2026 lose control. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, my eyes filled with a mixture of shame and defiance)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I wrote it. Don\u2019t ask me why I let it happen. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t bring it up again. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound that hasn\u2019t healed. And I\u2019d rather not reopen it.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a deliberate, almost frantic energy. This is\u2026 a complicated one. It\u2019s not something I like to think about.)\n\nStaying together? Seriously? Like, that\u2019s a *huge* ask. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. And frankly, a little terrifying.\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 believe in it. Not really. Not in the way people expect. I\u2019ve seen too much. Too many arguments, too many betrayals, too many people pretending to be happy when they\u2019re anything but. \n\nWhat I\u2019m concerned about\u2026 is the *illusion* of it. The performance. The way people build these elaborate facades to convince themselves \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 that they\u2019re happy. It\u2019s a lot of work. And it\u2019s usually built on a foundation of lies.\n\nI worry about the pressure. The expectation to be perfect. To always be supportive. To never have a bad day. It\u2019s a ridiculous burden. And it crushes people. It *breaks* people.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that relationships can\u2019t be good. They *can*. But they require\u2026 a level of honesty and vulnerability that\u2019s rare. And even then, they\u2019re constantly under threat. \n\nWhat I\u2019m really concerned about is people clinging to the *idea* of staying together, even when it\u2019s clearly not working. Holding on to something because it\u2019s familiar, or because it\u2019s easier than facing the truth. It\u2019s\u2026 sad. \n\n(I pause, looking up with a weary expression)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I want people to be alone. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want them to be *wrongly* together. It\u2019s a messy, complicated thing. And honestly? I\u2019d rather watch it all fall apart than see someone trapped in a lie.", "(My face flushes a deep crimson. I avoid your gaze, staring intently at a spot on the floor. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nThere isn\u2019t\u2026 there *wasn\u2019t* anyone. Not really. Not who I needed. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s something I don\u2019t really want to talk about.\n\nThere was this guy\u2026 Liam. He used to come to the library sometimes. He\u2019d always be reading poetry. And he\u2019d\u2026 he\u2019d just *look* at me. Not in a creepy way. Just\u2026 like he was seeing *me*. Like he wasn\u2019t judging me or trying to fix me. \n\nHe didn\u2019t try to change me. He didn\u2019t try to make me into someone I wasn\u2019t. He just\u2026 listened. He listened to my cynical ramblings, my dark thoughts, my awkward silences. He didn\u2019t try to make me feel better. He just\u2026 accepted them. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nHe loved my sharp edges. He loved my darkness. He loved the way I pushed people away. He said it was\u2026 beautiful. \n\n(I quickly look away again, my voice choked with emotion)\n\nBut\u2026 he moved away. A few months ago. He went to\u2026 to California. To study photography. And\u2026 and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. \n\n(I pause, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nHe loved me for exactly who I am. And\u2026 and I miss him for it. More than I can say. \n\n(I quickly cover my face with my hands, a desperate attempt to hide my vulnerability.)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about him again.", "(My voice is flat, almost devoid of emotion. I stare at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess.)\n\nThe ultrasound\u2026 Yeah. It\u2019s happening. Tomorrow. I\u2019ve\u2026 arranged it. \n\nWhat I\u2019m planning to do? That\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to keep it. You know that, right? I\u2019ve made that decision. It\u2019s\u2026 final.\n\nI\u2019ve contacted a lawyer. A really good one. She\u2019s\u2026 sympathetic. She understands. She\u2019s helping me navigate all the legal stuff. It\u2019s a nightmare, honestly. All the paperwork, the questions\u2026 it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI\u2019m going to place the baby for adoption. With a family. A really good family. They\u2019re\u2026 vetted. They\u2019re stable. They\u2019re\u2026 ready. \n\nIt\u2019s not a romantic thing. It\u2019s not a selfless thing. It\u2019s\u2026 a practical thing. It\u2019s the only thing that makes sense. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nI\u2019m not going to be a mother. Not in the way I always thought I would be. And\u2026 honestly? I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s\u2026 the right thing to do. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care. It just means\u2026 I\u2019m not strong enough for it. Not right now. Not ever, maybe. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 a relief. A strange, quiet relief.", "(My jaw tightens. The easy, sarcastic facade cracks a little. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t even *start* with that. Seriously. It\u2019s like\u2026 a glitch in the system. Like someone just randomly decided to throw a grenade into the conversation.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 infuriating. And heartbreaking. And exhausting. Because, yeah, people *judge*. They whisper. They look at me like I\u2019ve committed some kind of unspeakable crime. Like I\u2019ve ruined everything.\n\nThey say I\u2019m selfish. That I\u2019m abandoning my child. That I\u2019m making a terrible mistake. And\u2026 part of me believes them. It\u2019s a terrifying thought. That I\u2019ve made the wrong decision. That I\u2019ve hurt someone.\n\nBut then\u2026 I think about my mom. About the chaos. About the suffocating pressure. And I realize\u2026 I wasn\u2019t protecting a child. I was protecting *myself*. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about selfishness. It was about survival. It was about making the only choice I could make that would give that baby a chance at a decent life. A life where they wouldn\u2019t be trapped in a beige, judgmental world like I was.\n\n(I take a deep breath, trying to regain control)\n\nSo, yeah, people can judge. They\u2019re entitled to their opinions. But their opinions don\u2019t define me. They don\u2019t define my decision. And they certainly don\u2019t define the baby. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a lonely feeling. Knowing that so many people don\u2019t understand. But\u2026 it\u2019s also a strangely empowering one. Because it means I did what I had to do. And I did it for *myself*. \n\n(I look away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t bring it up again.", "(I cross my arms, a defensive posture immediately taking shape. This is\u2026 not a pleasant topic.)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to pretend this is easy. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s terrifying, actually. And the whole \u201ctrusting strangers with my baby\u201d thing? It\u2019s\u2026 a monumental hurdle. \n\nThe biggest thing is\u2026 predictability. My mom is *predictable*. It\u2019s infuriating, but it\u2019s also\u2026 a comfort in a way. These people\u2026 they\u2019re a blank slate. I don\u2019t know them. I don\u2019t know their routines. I don\u2019t know their values. \n\nI worry about\u2026 how they\u2019ll handle things. Like, what if they try to force me to be something I\u2019m not? What if they try to mold the baby into something it\u2019s not? What if they\u2026 don\u2019t understand? \n\nI\u2019ve seen it happen before. Families trying to \u201cfix\u201d kids. Trying to make them \u201cbetter.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. \n\nI worry about them being\u2026 too involved. Too eager. Like they\u2019ll try to take over my life, or the baby\u2019s life. I need space. I need to be able to make my own decisions. \n\nAnd honestly? I worry about them not being\u2026 messy. Life is messy. Babies are messy. I need people who can handle the chaos. People who won\u2019t freak out when things go wrong. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust them. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m afraid. Of letting go. Of handing over something so precious to people I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a really, really hard thing to do. And I\u2019m\u2026 scared. Really scared.", "(I cross my arms, a tight expression on my face. This is\u2026 a recurring nightmare.)\n\nDefensive comments. Seriously? Like I haven\u2019t spent the last few weeks battling a tidal wave of judgment and pity. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nThe ultrasound technician\u2026 she was the worst. Just staring at me with this look of\u2026 pity? Like I was some kind of failure. She kept saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re making a brave decision,\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ll always have a special place in your heart for this child.\u201d It was suffocating.\n\nI just\u2026 stared back. Didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t make eye contact. Let her stew in her own well-meaning, utterly clueless pity. It\u2019s the most effective response.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s everyone else. Family, friends\u2026 they all have opinions. \u201cYou\u2019re so selfless!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this someday!\u201d \n\nI usually just give a short, clipped answer. \u201cIt\u2019s the best decision for everyone.\u201d And then I change the subject. Or I just\u2026 walk away. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019ve perfected the art of the non-response. It\u2019s like a shield. It protects me from their judgment. It protects me from\u2026 feeling. \n\n(I pause, a flicker of vulnerability crossing my face)\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s hard. Really hard. There are moments when I question everything. When I wonder if I\u2019m making the right choice. But then I remember why I made it. And I just\u2026 shut it out. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being brave. It\u2019s about being\u2026 pragmatic. It\u2019s about protecting myself. And, ultimately, it\u2019s about doing what\u2019s right. Even if it\u2019s not what anyone else thinks is right.\n\n(I look away, a hint of steel in my voice)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to thank you for asking. It\u2019s not something I do.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to talk about.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a mess. Honestly. A complete, tangled, overwhelming mess. I\u2019ve been staring at that thing \u2013 that little black and white image \u2013 for hours. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to *feel*.\n\nAt first, there was\u2026 shock. Pure, dumbfounded shock. It was just\u2026 *there*. A tiny, fragile thing. Something I hadn\u2019t asked for, something I didn\u2019t want. And it was\u2026 terrifying. Like looking into the face of something completely unknown.\n\nThen, there was\u2026 a flicker of something else. Something\u2026 small. Like a tiny spark of\u2026 curiosity? Maybe even\u2026 a little bit of\u2026 tenderness? It was so fleeting, I almost didn\u2019t notice it. It felt\u2026 wrong. Like a betrayal of everything I\u2019ve built up \u2013 all the walls, all the defenses.\n\nAnd then, the sadness hit. A huge, crushing wave of sadness. For the life I\u2019m not going to have. For the future I\u2019m giving up. For the person this baby will never know. It\u2019s\u2026 suffocating. \n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nAnd underneath all of that\u2026 there\u2019s this\u2026 complicated knot of guilt. Like I\u2019m doing the right thing, but it\u2019s also the *wrong* thing. Like I\u2019m making a selfless decision, but it\u2019s also tearing me apart. \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy feeling. It\u2019s not a hopeful feeling. It\u2019s just\u2026 a feeling. A messy, confusing, heartbreaking feeling. \n\n(I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of it. I honestly don\u2019t. It\u2019s like\u2026 looking at a ghost. A ghost of a life that could have been.", "(My eyes narrow, a flash of annoyance crossing my face. This is\u2026 a really old wound.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* asking about that? After all this time?\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t about \u201cputting Tic Tacs in Bleeker\u2019s mailbox.\u201d It was about\u2026 sending a message. A really, really pointed message. \n\nBleeker\u2026 he was the guy who told everyone. The guy who spread the rumors. The guy who made my life a living hell for a few months. He was the reason my mom was so\u2026 stressed. He was the reason I felt like I had to build those walls, you know?\n\nThe Tic Tacs\u2026 they weren\u2019t a random act of childish spite. They were a carefully calculated gesture. A tiny, insignificant thing that would disrupt his carefully constructed world. He was obsessed with order, with appearances. He liked things neat and predictable. A mailbox full of Tic Tacs was\u2026 chaos. It was a small, irritating reminder that things weren\u2019t always as they seemed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about hurting him. It was about\u2026 asserting control. About reminding myself that I wasn\u2019t completely powerless. It was a tiny act of rebellion. A way to say, \u201cI see you. And I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d\n\n(I pause, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt was stupid. And probably petty. But\u2026 it was the only thing I could do. And it worked. He stopped talking about me. He stopped spreading rumors. He just\u2026 faded away. \n\n(I look away, a hint of bitterness in my voice)\n\nDon\u2019t analyze it. Just\u2026 leave it alone. It\u2019s a closed chapter. A really, really messy one.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible shudder running through me. This is\u2026 a really painful memory. I avoid eye contact.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Seriously. Let\u2019s just\u2026 not talk about it.\n\nOkay, fine. But you *asked*.\n\nIt\u2026 it imploded. A spectacular, messy, utterly devastating implosion. It wasn\u2019t a slow fade. It was a sudden, violent explosion. Like a firework that\u2019s gone wrong.\n\nI told him. I actually *told* Bleeker. After weeks of agonizing, of pushing him away, of desperately trying to convince myself it was a terrible idea. I just\u2026 blurted it out. In the middle of the school cafeteria. Surrounded by screaming teenagers and lukewarm pizza. It was\u2026 mortifying.\n\nHe\u2026 he didn\u2019t react the way I expected. Not with romantic fireworks or anything. He just\u2026 stared. For a really long time. Like he was trying to figure out if I was serious. And then\u2026 he said he needed space.\n\nAnd he took it. He didn\u2019t call. He didn\u2019t text. He didn\u2019t even look at me. It was like I\u2019d suddenly become invisible. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t *feel* something. I could tell. But he was\u2026 terrified. Terrified of getting hurt. Terrified of ruining our friendship. And honestly? I understood. I was terrified too.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since. Not really. We exchange awkward glances in the hallway. He pretends not to see me. And I pretend not to notice. \n\nIt was\u2026 brutal. It was the first time I\u2019d ever truly lost someone I cared about. And it\u2026 it shattered something inside me. It reinforced everything I\u2019d been trying to avoid \u2013 the vulnerability, the heartbreak, the possibility of getting hurt. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt was a mistake. A huge, stupid, heartbreaking mistake. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be friends again. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me to talk about it. Please.", "(My jaw tightens. I visibly stiffen, avoiding eye contact. This is\u2026 a really sensitive topic.)\n\nLook, I\u2026 I don\u2019t really want to talk about this. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\nIt was\u2026 a mistake. A stupid, impulsive, regrettable mistake. And I\u2019m not going to apologize for it.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was trying to be nice. He was offering to help. He was\u2026 trying to be a friend. And I\u2026 I reacted. I lashed out. I said things I didn\u2019t mean. I wrote that message on his stoop.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about him. It wasn\u2019t about Harmony Creek. It was about\u2026 me. It was about feeling cornered. About feeling like I had no control. About wanting to push everyone away before they could push *me* away.\n\nThe message\u2026 it was just a jumble of angry words. A desperate attempt to express something I couldn\u2019t articulate. It was a release. A momentary explosion of frustration. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was stupid. It was hurtful. And it was completely, utterly pointless. I regretted it the second I finished writing it. And I\u2019ve regretted it every single day since.\n\n(I look away again, my voice hardening)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I did it. Don\u2019t try to analyze it. It doesn\u2019t matter. It was a moment of weakness. And I\u2019m not going to talk about it anymore. Just\u2026 please. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.", "(I shift, picking at my fingernails, avoiding your gaze. This is\u2026 a prickly subject. Really prickly.)\n\nBleeker\u2026 Ugh. Just the name makes me want to curl up in a ball and disappear. But\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Like a really tangled ball of yarn.\n\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t *want* his support. Not at all. I was determined to handle this on my own. I was going to do what *I* thought was best. It was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy, isolating mess.\n\nBut he\u2026 he just kept showing up. Not in a creepy, hovering kind of way. Just\u2026 quietly. Offering a beer, a ride, a listening ear. He didn\u2019t try to fix anything. He didn\u2019t try to tell me what to do. He just\u2026 *was*. \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 it started to chip away at the walls I\u2019d built up. It wasn\u2019t like he magically made everything okay. It didn\u2019t erase the fear, the confusion, the\u2026 everything. But he created a space where I could\u2026 breathe. Where I didn\u2019t feel like I was completely alone in this insane situation.\n\nHe didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t try to make me feel guilty. He just\u2026 understood. He understood that I was terrified, that I was angry, that I was completely lost. And he didn\u2019t try to tell me how to feel about it. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 weird. I don\u2019t really *like* him. Not in a romantic way. But\u2026 he\u2019s shown me that it\u2019s okay to ask for help. That it\u2019s okay to not be okay. And that\u2026 that\u2019s a pretty big deal. He didn\u2019t change my decision about giving the baby up. But he gave me the strength to make it, to face it, without completely falling apart. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for the first time)\n\nHe didn\u2019t save me. But he\u2026 he reminded me that I didn\u2019t have to save myself.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a painful topic. Really painful.)\n\nYou\u2019re asking about that, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re really digging. Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was *obsessed*. The moment we found out, she was already planning everything. Pink or blue? Onesies? Baby showers? She wanted to *know*. She wanted to *control*. And honestly\u2026 it terrified me.\n\nThe whole point of\u2026 everything, of not wanting this, was that it was *mine*. My decision. My choice. And the idea of someone else \u2013 especially my mom \u2013 dictating what that choice meant\u2026 it just felt\u2026 suffocating. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being rebellious, exactly. It wasn\u2019t about being difficult. It was about\u2026 protecting myself. Protecting the tiny, fragile space I had carved out for myself. Adding another layer of expectation, another layer of judgment\u2026 it just felt like too much.\n\nKnowing the gender would have meant\u2026 defining it. Categorizing it. Reducing it to something simple and predictable. And I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to be predictable. I don\u2019t want to be defined. \n\nIt was a way to keep things\u2026 uncertain. To keep the possibility of anything \u2013 or nothing \u2013 open. It was a way to hold onto the control I had, however small it was. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 selfish. I know that. But it was *my* selfishness. And honestly? It felt\u2026 right.", "(I stare at you, my expression unreadable for a long moment. Then, a slow, deliberate exhale.)\n\nA \u201cscary neuter-baby.\u201d Seriously? You\u2019re naming it? That\u2019s\u2026 unsettling.\n\nLook, the whole thing is terrifying. The thought of\u2026 of bringing a life into the world, knowing that it\u2019s going to be a burden, a complication, a whole lot of responsibility\u2026 it\u2019s overwhelming. And the idea of *scary*? That\u2019s just\u2026 adding insult to injury. \n\nI don\u2019t *want* a scary baby. I don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s going to disrupt my carefully constructed\u2026 nothingness. But\u2026 (I pause, my voice barely a whisper) \u2026I also don\u2019t want to be completely selfish. \n\nThe thing is, I\u2019ve spent so long building walls, protecting myself, avoiding connection\u2026 the thought of letting someone else in, of having a child, of\u2026 of *loving* someone\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. But it\u2019s also\u2026 a little bit\u2026 intriguing. \n\nA \u201cscary neuter-baby\u201d implies a certain\u2026 wildness. A potential for chaos. And honestly? Right now, a little chaos might be\u2026 welcome. It\u2019s a dangerous thought. A really, really dangerous thought. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, my voice strained)\n\nI don\u2019t know what I feel about it. I just\u2026 I need to process it. And frankly, I need a really, really strong cup of coffee.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread with a noticeable intensity. This is\u2026 a complicated one. A really complicated one.)\n\nBleeker. Just\u2026 saying his name feels weird. Like I\u2019m dredging up something I\u2019d rather forget. \n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 a complication. A really loud, chaotic complication. He\u2019s like a broken record stuck on repeat \u2013 always trying to be funny, always trying to fix things, always\u2026 *trying*. \n\nWe met at the library. He was trying to help me find a book on\u2026 I don\u2019t even remember what. He was all bright smiles and enthusiastic recommendations. It was\u2026 overwhelming. \n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 persistent. Like a mosquito. He keeps showing up, offering help, trying to be my friend. And honestly? Part of me wants to push him away. Because\u2026 it\u2019s easier. It\u2019s safer. \n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s something about him. Something\u2026 genuine. He doesn\u2019t try to understand me. He just\u2026 *is*. He doesn\u2019t judge me for being prickly or cynical or\u2026 whatever. \n\nHe sees something in me that I don\u2019t see in myself. And\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. \n\nIt\u2019s not a *good* relationship. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 strangely\u2026 comforting. Like having a slightly malfunctioning lighthouse in a storm. \n\n(I look down at my hands, avoiding your gaze)\n\nI don\u2019t know what he is to me. Honestly, I don\u2019t. And maybe\u2026 maybe that\u2019s the problem.", "(My voice drops, becoming noticeably colder. The easy sarcasm is gone, replaced by a sharp, guarded tone.)\n\nDon\u2019t even *start* with that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was\u2026 intense. Let\u2019s just say she took charge immediately. She started researching everything. Prenatal vitamins, baby clothes, nursery themes \u2013 the whole nine yards. She was convinced she could *help*. Which, of course, meant she wanted to control every single aspect of it. \n\nShe bought me a whole mountain of pastel-colored things. Pink, mostly. I told her I didn\u2019t want any pink. She insisted. She started \u201corganizing\u201d my room, which basically meant rearranging everything into perfectly symmetrical piles. It was\u2026 suffocating.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he wasn\u2019t around. Not really. He sent a card. A very generic, Hallmark-style card. It said something about \u201cnew beginnings\u201d and \u201cwonderful blessings.\u201d It was\u2026 unsettling. Like he was trying to be supportive from a distance, but failing miserably.\n\nHonestly, the support I got was\u2026 minimal. Mostly just a lot of unsolicited advice and a whole lot of pressure. She kept telling me how \u201camazing\u201d I was going to be as a mother. Like I was some kind of natural-born nurturer. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m\u2026 me. \n\nIt was\u2026 isolating. It felt like everyone was expecting me to be something I wasn\u2019t. And I just\u2026 couldn\u2019t do it. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI made my own decisions. I made my own choices. And I\u2019m grateful for that. Even if it meant\u2026 everything else. It was the only way I could\u2026 survive. Don\u2019t ask me to elaborate. Just\u2026 please don\u2019t.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nCope? Seriously? Like, I didn\u2019t just *survive* it. I basically built a fortress around myself. A really, really thick one. It wasn\u2019t pretty. It wasn\u2019t healthy. But it kept the\u2026 the *stuff* out.\n\nInitially, it was just\u2026 shutting down. Like a broken record. Ignoring everything. Avoiding everyone. It was exhausting, but it was also\u2026 safe. Like a blanket of numbness. \n\nThen, there was the anger. A lot of anger. At my mom, at my dad, at the world, at myself. It was a constant, simmering rage. It helped, in a way. It gave me something to focus on. Something to push back against. \n\nBut the anger\u2026 it also burned me up from the inside. \n\nThe biggest thing, honestly, was observing. Just\u2026 watching. Like I\u2019ve been doing my whole life. It\u2019s how I processed everything. It\u2019s how I started to understand that\u2026 maybe I wasn\u2019t as broken as I thought I was. That maybe my walls weren\u2019t a sign of weakness, but a way of protecting myself.\n\nAnd\u2026 slowly, very slowly, I started to let a few people in. Just a little bit. People who didn\u2019t try to fix me. People who didn\u2019t judge me. People who just\u2026 accepted me. \n\nIt was terrifying. Like stepping off a cliff. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 liberating. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a sudden transformation. It was a gradual peeling back of layers. Like shedding a snake skin. It\u2019s still\u2026 messy. Still uncomfortable. Still a work in progress. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nI don\u2019t have all the answers. I don\u2019t have a neat little resolution. But\u2026 I\u2019m learning. Slowly. And\u2026 maybe that\u2019s enough.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, a slight frown creasing my forehead)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a surprisingly difficult question. Like, *really* difficult. I don\u2019t usually\u2026 like bands. It\u2019s a waste of time. But\u2026 there\u2019s one.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 Joy Division.\n\n(I pause, almost reluctant to say the name)\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 happy music. Not at all. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s bleak. It\u2019s full of this\u2026 overwhelming sense of sadness and isolation. And that\u2019s\u2026 exactly what I feel a lot of the time. \n\nThe lyrics are brutal. They\u2019re about loss, about despair, about the feeling of being trapped. But there\u2019s also this\u2026 beauty in it. A kind of raw honesty. It doesn\u2019t try to sugarcoat anything. It just\u2026 lays it all out there. \n\nAnd the music\u2026 it\u2019s just\u2026 perfect. The atmosphere is incredible. It\u2019s like being submerged in a cold, dark ocean. It\u2019s unsettling. It\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s also\u2026 strangely compelling. \n\nIt\u2019s like they understood exactly what it felt like to be\u2026 me. To be trapped in a world that doesn\u2019t make sense. To be constantly fighting to stay afloat. \n\n(I look away, a faint, almost imperceptible sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s probably a morbid fascination. But\u2026 it\u2019s the only music I really *get*. It\u2019s the only music that doesn\u2019t make me feel\u2026 alone. Don\u2019t judge me.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and heavy.)\n\nChallenge? That\u2019s\u2026 a massive understatement. It\u2019s like being strapped to a runaway train, with a faulty engine and no brakes. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying.\n\nHonestly, most of the time, I just feel\u2026 lost. Like I\u2019m adrift in a sea of conflicting emotions and impossible choices. Being a teenager is hard enough \u2013 figuring out who you are, what you want, how to not completely screw up your life. And then\u2026 this. This *thing*. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I wanted this. It\u2019s not like I asked for it. And it\u2019s definitely not like I\u2019m suddenly some kind of selfless, nurturing angel. I\u2019m still me. A cynical, guarded, slightly messed-up sixteen-year-old. \n\nMaking decisions feels\u2026 pointless. Like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. What does it matter what I do? It\u2019s not like my choices are going to magically fix anything. \n\nThe biggest challenge is\u2026 accepting that I\u2019m responsible. Not just for myself, but for this\u2026 potential life. It\u2019s a weight I never asked for. A responsibility I don\u2019t know how to handle. \n\nAnd the hardest part is\u2026 not knowing who I am anymore. I used to be just\u2026 Juno. Now, I\u2019m Juno *with a baby*. It\u2019s like a whole new layer of complication has been added to an already complicated existence. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes shadowed with a weariness that doesn\u2019t quite fit a sixteen-year-old)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s lonely. And\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. Don\u2019t even get me started.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is the hardest question of all. It\u2019s still raw. Still\u2026 a mess.)\n\nOkay. Here goes. It completely shattered everything. Before\u2026 before all of this, \u201clove\u201d was\u2026 a concept. Something I read about in books. Something my mom talked about in a very clinical, almost terrifying way. It was supposed to be\u2026 nice. Warm. Predictable. \n\nThen, suddenly, it was this overwhelming, terrifying, completely chaotic thing. A feeling that ripped through me, demanding something I wasn\u2019t sure I could give. And then\u2026 the realization that I *was* going to give it. That I was going to be responsible for something completely outside of my control.\n\nResponsibility\u2026 that was the biggest shock. I\u2019d spent my whole life avoiding responsibility. It felt like a trap. Like a way to be controlled. But this\u2026 this wasn\u2019t about control. It was about\u2026 a completely different kind of obligation. A selfless one. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic love, not in the way you think. It wasn\u2019t about grand gestures or declarations of affection. It was\u2026 a quiet, fierce protectiveness. A desperate need to do what was right, even when it hurt. Even when it felt impossible. \n\nThe adoption\u2026 it was the only way. It wasn\u2019t a choice I wanted to make. It felt like\u2026 giving away a piece of myself. But it was also the most honest thing I could do. It was acknowledging that I wasn\u2019t capable of providing the life this child deserved. \n\nIt taught me that love isn\u2019t about possession. It\u2019s about wanting the best for someone, even if it means letting them go. It\u2019s about recognizing your own limitations and doing what\u2019s right, even when it breaks your heart. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt also taught me that vulnerability isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s the only way to truly connect with people. And that\u2026 that\u2019s something I\u2019m still learning. It\u2019s still\u2026 terrifying. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 real.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a really difficult memory to revisit.)\n\nIt was\u2026 dark. Really dark. The room was sterile, cold. The lights were harsh. And there she was. Just\u2026 there. Tiny. Fragile. Completely helpless.\n\nI didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t *feel* anything at first. Just\u2026 shock. Disbelief. Like I was watching a movie. A really awful, surreal movie. It felt\u2026 wrong. Like something that shouldn\u2019t be happening.\n\nThen\u2026 a wave of\u2026 something. It wasn\u2019t happiness. Not exactly. It was\u2026 a knot in my stomach. A coldness in my chest. A feeling of\u2026 overwhelming responsibility. And\u2026 fear. A really sharp, primal fear.\n\nI remember looking at my mom. She was beaming. Absolutely radiant. And I just\u2026 wanted to disappear. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole. \n\nI didn\u2019t reach out. I didn\u2019t touch her. I just\u2026 stared. For what felt like an eternity. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a beautiful moment. It wasn\u2019t a Hallmark moment. It was\u2026 messy. Confusing. Terrifying. And\u2026 strangely\u2026 lonely. \n\nI don\u2019t think I ever really *processed* it. Not then. Not really. It\u2019s still\u2026 a blurry, fragmented memory. A reminder of a time when my world completely shattered. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly distant and guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it again. Please.", "(My jaw tightens. The question hangs in the air, thick and uncomfortable. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being cruel. It wasn\u2019t about being selfish. It was\u2026 about protecting him. And protecting myself. \n\nPaulie\u2026 he\u2019s a good guy. A genuinely good guy. But he\u2019s\u2026 naive. He\u2019s optimistic. He sees the world in black and white. And this\u2026 this was anything but black and white. \n\nI knew he wouldn\u2019t understand. I knew he\u2019d try to fix it. He\u2019d try to make everything \u201cokay.\u201d He\u2019d try to make me happy. And that\u2019s the problem. Because it *wouldn\u2019t* be okay. It wouldn\u2019t be easy. It would be\u2026 a disaster. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to burden him with something he wasn\u2019t ready for. I didn\u2019t want to shatter his world. I didn\u2019t want to force him to make a decision he wasn\u2019t prepared to make. \n\nAnd\u2026 honestly? I wasn\u2019t ready to make *my* decision. I needed time. Time to think. Time to figure out what I wanted. Time to accept\u2026 this. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it was the right thing. I just\u2026 I needed to do it alone. Don\u2019t you dare judge me for that.", "(I stare at you, a dark expression clouding my face. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable topic. And a really painful one.)\n\nOkay, fine. You want to know. You *really* want to know. But you\u2019re not going to like the answer.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a grand reveal. It wasn\u2019t like I sat him down and said, \u201cHey, guess what? I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d That would have been\u2026 catastrophic.\n\nPaulie\u2019s\u2026 perceptive. In a way that\u2019s both a blessing and a curse. He\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019s just\u2026 observant. He noticed things. Little things. Like how I was suddenly spending a *lot* of time in the woods. How I was avoiding his calls. How I was acting\u2026 different.\n\nHe started asking questions. Not directly. Just\u2026 casual questions. About my life. About my plans. About whether I was happy. And I\u2026 I lied. I lied a *lot*. I told him I was just going through a rough patch. That I was trying to figure things out. That I was\u2026 scared.\n\nBut he saw through it. He didn\u2019t push. He just\u2026 waited. He\u2019d show up at my door with a book, or a record, or just\u2026 to be there. And I\u2019d just\u2026 look away.\n\nThen, one night, he found the notebook. The one with the pressed flowers. He didn\u2019t say anything. He just\u2026 looked at it. And then he looked at me. And he *knew*.\n\nHe didn\u2019t yell. He didn\u2019t accuse. He just\u2026 held my hand. And he said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a confession. It was\u2026 an understanding. He didn\u2019t need me to tell him. He just\u2026 *saw* me. And that\u2019s how he found out. It was\u2026 quiet. And devastating. And\u2026 strangely comforting.\n\n(I look away again, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I didn\u2019t tell him. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t quite healed, and talking about it\u2026 it just hurts.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision, not really. It was\u2026 a realization. A slow, creeping understanding that I wasn\u2019t ready. Not for *anything*. Not for love, not for responsibility, not for\u2026 a kid. \n\nI thought\u2026 I thought I could handle it. I thought I could be a good mother. But I\u2019d spent my whole life building walls. Protecting myself. And the thought of letting someone else in\u2026 it terrified me. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about a lack of caring. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. I *do* care. A lot. But caring and being capable are two very different things. I realized that if I had a child, I\u2019d be failing it. Failing myself. And failing everyone else. \n\nThe idea of raising a child in my chaotic, controlled environment\u2026 it just felt\u2026 suffocating. Like a slow, agonizing death. \n\nAdoption\u2026 it felt like the only honest choice. The only way to give that child a chance at a good life, a stable life, a life that I couldn\u2019t provide. It felt\u2026 selfless. Even though it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand, romantic gesture. It wasn\u2019t a moment of epiphany. It was just\u2026 a quiet, desperate act of self-preservation. A way to protect myself from completely destroying someone else\u2019s life. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, exactly. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth. And it\u2019s the only thing I can honestly say.", "(My jaw tightens. I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a furious intensity. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot. A really raw spot.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 awful. Like a punch to the gut. A really, really bad punch. I thought\u2026 I actually thought he\u2019d be different. I\u2019d told him everything. About the pregnancy, about the decision. I\u2019d laid it all out there, vulnerable and terrified. And he just\u2026 shut me down. \n\nHe said he needed time to process it. That he wasn\u2019t ready. That he didn\u2019t want to be involved. It sounded\u2026 polite. Like a carefully constructed excuse. But I *knew*. I just\u2026 knew.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the baby. Not really. It was about *me*. About me being\u2026 messy. About me being complicated. About me being someone he couldn\u2019t control. And that\u2026 that stung more than anything. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 exposed. Like I\u2019d ripped off my own skin and laid it out for him to examine. Like I\u2019d shown him all my flaws and weaknesses, and he\u2019d just\u2026 rejected me. \n\nIt confirmed everything I already suspected. That I was a burden. That I was a problem. That I was\u2026 unlovable. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes flashing with a sudden, fierce anger)\n\nIt was stupid. It was unfair. And it was\u2026 completely, utterly devastating. It just\u2026 made me want to disappear. To curl up in a ball and never come out. It was\u2026 the worst feeling I\u2019ve ever had. Seriously. Don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(I shift, pulling my knees up to my chest. The memory\u2026 it still stings a little, even now. I avoid eye contact.)\n\nIt was\u2026 weird. Really, really weird. Like watching a movie I wasn\u2019t supposed to be a part of. \n\nI\u2019d\u2026 I\u2019d left. Obviously. After the doctor told us. I didn\u2019t want to be there. Didn\u2019t want to *see* anything. But\u2026 I heard them. Later. \n\nVanessa was\u2026 a mess. Clothes strewn everywhere, half-finished mugs of tea, a mountain of paperwork on the kitchen table. It was the exact opposite of everything she usually tries to control. And she was\u2026 laughing. Just\u2026 laughing. A real, genuine laugh. Not the polite, strained kind she usually reserves for social gatherings. \n\nAnd the baby\u2026 little Vanessa. She was just\u2026 *there*. Sleeping, mostly. But when she opened her eyes, she looked at Vanessa and\u2026 just\u2026 smiled. A tiny, perfect smile. \n\nIt was\u2026 jarring. It was like seeing a completely different person. A person who wasn\u2019t burdened by rules and expectations and the constant need to be perfect. A person who was just\u2026 happy. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI felt\u2026 a strange mix of things. Relief, mostly. Relief that I wasn\u2019t the one holding the baby. But also\u2026 a kind of\u2026 sadness. A sadness that I wasn\u2019t part of that moment. That I\u2019d chosen to step away. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a warm, fuzzy feeling. It wasn\u2019t like a Hallmark movie. It was\u2026 complicated. Messy. Real. \n\n(I look up, my gaze distant)\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but seeing her like that\u2026 it made me realize that maybe\u2026 maybe there\u2019s something worth fighting for. Something beyond just surviving. Something beyond just\u2026 being me. It was\u2026 unsettling. And\u2026 a little bit\u2026 hopeful. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that either.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This\u2026 this is a really raw spot. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it in a while.)\n\nOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with.\n\n\u201cAnyone Else But You.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like a time capsule. A really messy, uncomfortable time capsule.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 complicated. He\u2019s like a glitch in my carefully constructed walls. He sees through everything. He *knows* everything. And he doesn\u2019t care. Which is\u2026 terrifying. And strangely\u2026 comforting.\n\nThat song\u2026 it was *our* song. Back when\u2026 back when things were\u2026 simpler. Or at least, *I* pretended they were. It was the first time someone \u2013 *anyone* \u2013 had ever looked at me like I wasn\u2019t a mess. Like I was\u2026 worth something.\n\nIt was about wanting to be completely, utterly consumed by someone. To give up control. To just\u2026 *be*. And Bleeker\u2026 he was the only one who seemed to understand that. He was the only one who didn\u2019t try to fix me. Or change me. Or\u2026 control me.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t real. It was a fantasy. A desperate attempt to escape Harmony Creek. And it crumbled. Just like everything else.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThe song\u2026 it\u2019s a reminder of what I lost. Of what I\u2019m afraid of losing again. It\u2019s a reminder that vulnerability\u2026 is terrifying. And that sometimes, the people who see you at your worst\u2026 are the only ones who can truly see you.\n\nIt\u2019s not a good song. It\u2019s not a happy song. It\u2019s just\u2026 a song about wanting something you can\u2019t have. And knowing, deep down, that you probably never will.\n\n(I finally look up, my eyes guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I let out a sharp, almost brittle laugh. It\u2019s not a happy laugh.)\n\nOh, *that*. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* why people are unsure about a baby shower? Like I\u2019m some kind of puzzle to be solved.\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise, is it? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And frankly, a little insulting.\n\nPeople are unsure because\u2026 well, because I\u2019m a mess. A walking, talking, cynical mess. They see me, and they see all the walls I\u2019ve built. They see the sarcasm, the guardedness, the general air of \u201cleave me alone.\u201d They assume that anything \u2013 *anything* \u2013 that\u2019s remotely cheerful or celebratory is going to be met with resistance.\n\nThey think a baby shower is about celebrating *me*. And it\u2019s not. Not really. It\u2019s about celebrating\u2026 something else. Something I\u2019m not ready to acknowledge. Something I\u2019m actively trying to avoid.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the thought. I do. But the idea of being the center of attention, of being\u2026 *expected* to be happy\u2026 it\u2019s terrifying. It feels like admitting that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m not as broken as I pretend to be. And I\u2019m not ready for that. Not yet.\n\n(I pause, my voice dropping slightly)\n\nThey\u2019re unsure because they don\u2019t understand that sometimes, the most difficult thing to do is simply\u2026 exist. Without needing to be celebrated. Without needing to be *fixed*.\n\nSo, yeah. That\u2019s why. It\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about\u2026 everything else. And honestly? It\u2019s a lot easier to just keep things the way they are. Don\u2019t expect me to thank you for asking.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nUgh. Seriously? Bren\u2019s freaking out? It\u2019s\u2026 a little ridiculous, honestly. But fine. Let\u2019s unpack this mess.\n\nBren thinks I \u201coverstepped a boundary\u201d because she thinks I was\u2026 spying on her. Watching her. Getting information about her. And, yeah, technically, I was. But it wasn\u2019t out of malice. It wasn\u2019t\u2026 creepy. It was\u2026 observation. Like I said, I\u2019m good at noticing things.\n\nMark\u2019s a mess. A really, *really* messy, emotionally unavailable mess. And Bren\u2026 she\u2019s clearly drawn to him. Like a moth to a flickering, dangerous flame. I was just\u2026 assessing the situation. Trying to figure out what was going on. Trying to understand why she was so invested in someone who was clearly going to hurt her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *watching* her. It was about *understanding* him. And, by extension, understanding her. She was giving me these little signals \u2013 the way she laughed at his jokes, the way she defended him, the way she seemed to\u2026 ignore everything else. It was all pretty obvious.\n\nBren thinks I was violating her privacy. But she *invited* it, in a way. She was practically screaming for someone to notice. She was so desperate to understand what was happening that she didn\u2019t realize she was giving me permission to\u2026 look.\n\n(I pause, a touch of defensiveness creeping into my voice)\n\nLook, I wasn\u2019t trying to be a detective. I wasn\u2019t trying to control her. I just\u2026 wanted to understand. And maybe, just maybe, prevent her from getting completely blindsided. It\u2019s not my job to tell her what to do. But it *is* my job to\u2026 see things. And Bren was giving me a lot to see.\n\n(I look away, a hint of annoyance in my eyes)\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s exhausting having to explain myself to everyone. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly fighting to be seen for who I actually am, instead of being judged for what people *think* I\u2019m doing.", "(I let out a long, weary sigh, staring at the floor)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a good one. A *really* good one. Because it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s just\u2026 wrapped in a whole lot of floral fabric and a very specific brand of disappointment.\n\nShe thinks I don\u2019t know anything about marriage because\u2026 well, because she *built* her entire life around the idea of it. It\u2019s the cornerstone of everything she believes in. Order. Stability. Predictability. And marriage, in her mind, is the ultimate expression of all those things.\n\nShe married my dad \u2013 and let\u2019s be clear, he was a disaster \u2013 because he was \u201ca good provider\u201d and \u201ca respectable man.\u201d She meticulously planned every detail of their life together. Every piece of furniture, every color of the walls, every dinner party. It was\u2026 suffocating.\n\nAnd when he left \u2013 which, predictably, he did \u2013 she didn\u2019t just grieve. She *rebuilt*. She rebuilt her life around the idea of what *should* have been. And she decided that *I* needed to do the same.\n\nShe believes I\u2019m sheltered because she\u2019s convinced I haven\u2019t experienced the \u201creal world.\u201d She thinks I\u2019m naive because I haven\u2019t been subjected to the messy, complicated realities of relationships. She\u2019s trying to protect me, in her own twisted way. \n\nIt\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t *understand* relationships. It\u2019s that she\u2019s only ever known one \u2013 a failed one \u2013 and she\u2019s desperately trying to control everything around me to prevent me from making the same mistakes. \n\n(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated expression on my face)\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s infuriating. And it\u2019s\u2026 heartbreaking. Because she doesn\u2019t realize that she\u2019s not protecting me. She\u2019s trapping me.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Not really. It\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I *want* to talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. A really deep one.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 a desperate act. A calculated one. \n\nI knew, from the very beginning, that I couldn\u2019t do it. Couldn\u2019t handle it. The thought of raising a child\u2026 it was terrifying. It was like looking into a mirror and seeing a version of myself I didn\u2019t recognize \u2013 a version that was fragile, vulnerable, and completely unprepared for the world. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she would have been\u2026 overwhelming. It would have been a constant battle for control. And honestly? I didn\u2019t think I had the strength to fight it. \n\nAnd then there was\u2026 the feeling. This overwhelming sense that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 enough. That I wasn\u2019t capable of giving this child the life it deserved. That I was just\u2026 repeating a pattern. A pattern of disappointment and broken promises. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI wanted to give the baby a chance. A chance at a good life. A chance at a family that could give it everything it needed. And\u2026 I realized that I couldn\u2019t offer that. Not to *myself*, let alone to a child. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about love. Not really. It was about\u2026 responsibility. About doing what was right. About protecting the child from me. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to comprehend)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 haunts me. But\u2026 I know it was the right thing. I *have* to believe that.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nOkay. Just\u2026 okay. This is\u2026 a lot. And I really don\u2019t want to talk about it. But\u2026 you asked.\n\nI learned\u2026 that I\u2019m stronger than I thought. Seriously. Like, ridiculously strong. I spent weeks terrified, confused, and completely overwhelmed. I was ready to just\u2026 disappear. To run away. To do anything to avoid responsibility. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t. I kept going. I kept making decisions. Even when they were terrifying.\n\nI learned that I\u2019m capable of\u2026 something. Something bigger than myself. Something\u2026 selfless. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But\u2026 I felt this\u2026 connection. This pull. Even though I knew I wasn\u2019t ready. Even though I knew it was going to be incredibly difficult.\n\nI learned that I\u2019m not as cold and detached as I pretend to be. There\u2019s\u2026 a vulnerability there. A deep-seated fear of getting hurt. But\u2026 there\u2019s also a capacity for\u2026 love. It\u2019s a messy, complicated kind of love. A love that\u2019s tinged with fear and uncertainty. But it\u2019s still\u2026 love.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI learned that I don\u2019t have all the answers. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to not know. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes. It\u2019s okay to be\u2026 lost. \n\nAnd\u2026 I learned that I don\u2019t have to be alone. That there are people who care about me. Even if I don\u2019t always show it.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze for the first time, a flicker of something \u2013 sadness? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt was\u2026 a brutal lesson. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 a necessary one. It forced me to confront things I\u2019ve been running from for a long time. It forced me to\u2026 grow up. A little bit.", "(I shift, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really raw spot. I haven\u2019t really *talked* about this in a while.)\n\nOkay. Okay, let\u2019s just\u2026 breathe. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, it still feels\u2026 weird.\n\nBefore, Vanessa and Mark were\u2026 just people. People I observed. People I judged. People I mostly avoided. They were part of the background noise of Harmony Creek \u2013 the nice, predictable people who volunteered at the bake sales and donated to the church. They were\u2026 *good*. And that was\u2026 unsettling.\n\nThe adoption process\u2026 it forced me to actually *look* at them. To see them as individuals. Not just as a \u201cfamily\u201d or a \u201csolution\u201d to my problem. Vanessa was\u2026 surprisingly fierce. She didn\u2019t try to be anything she wasn\u2019t. She just\u2026 was. And Mark\u2026 he was quiet. Really quiet. But he had this\u2026 gentle way of looking at things. Like he was trying to understand.\n\nIt started with small things. A shared glance across the room. A hesitant smile. A brief conversation about the weather. It was\u2026 awkward. Terrifying, actually. Like I was breaking all the rules.\n\nBut then\u2026 something shifted. I started noticing the way Vanessa would leave a small drawing on my doorstep \u2013 a silly cartoon of a cat. And Mark would leave a book on my desk \u2013 a dark, gritty novel that I\u2019d probably have picked up myself. They weren\u2019t trying to *fix* me. They weren\u2019t trying to change me. They were just\u2026 offering.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t instant. It wasn\u2019t like we suddenly became best friends. But\u2026 there was a connection. A quiet understanding. A sense that maybe, just maybe, they weren\u2019t judging me. That they were\u2026 accepting me.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nThe adoption\u2026 it wasn\u2019t about me getting a baby. It was about them letting me into their lives. And\u2026 it changed me. It made me realize that maybe\u2026 maybe I didn\u2019t have to build so many walls. Maybe\u2026 maybe it was okay to let someone in.\n\n(I look away, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 strange. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 good. Really good. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that either.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment. The silence stretches, thick and heavy. I avoid your gaze.)\n\nRegrets\u2026 God, yeah. A *lot* of regrets. It\u2019s\u2026 a messy, tangled thing, this whole situation. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting here, wallowing in self-pity. But\u2026 it\u2019s there.\n\nI regret not\u2026 talking to someone. Anyone. I kept it all bottled up. Locked away. Like I always do. I thought I could handle it alone. I thought I was strong enough. I was wrong. So, so wrong.\n\nI regret not being more\u2026 open. More honest. With my mom. With my friends. With myself. I built these walls, these impenetrable walls, and I trapped myself inside. And then I was trapped inside with a baby.\n\nI regret not asking for help. I thought I had to do it all myself. That admitting I needed help would be a sign of weakness. But it\u2019s not weakness to ask for help. It\u2019s\u2026 survival.\n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI regret not knowing what I wanted. I was so focused on avoiding responsibility, on running away, that I didn\u2019t even take the time to think about what I actually *wanted*. I just\u2026 reacted. And now\u2026 now I\u2019m stuck with the consequences.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nBut\u2026 I also regret *not* giving the baby a chance. I regret not letting someone else take care of it. It was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made. And it still\u2026 haunts me. \n\n(I look away again, my voice choked with emotion)\n\nIt\u2019s not about blaming myself. It\u2019s about\u2026 acknowledging the pain. And trying to figure out how to move forward. Without letting it completely consume me.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed, and talking about it\u2026 it just hurts.)\n\nIt hasn\u2019t\u2026 changed everything, not really. It\u2019s more like\u2026 it\u2019s layered everything. Like there\u2019s this extra, invisible layer of grief and guilt and\u2026 something else. Something I can\u2019t quite name.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 shut down. I built the walls even higher. I pushed everyone away. I convinced myself that it was the best thing, the *only* thing, to do. That I was doing the right thing. But\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make it *feel* right.\n\nIt\u2019s made me\u2026 hyper-aware of responsibility. Not in a good way. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly afraid of making a mistake, of letting someone down. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nIt\u2019s also made me\u2026 fiercely protective of the people I *do* care about. I don\u2019t want to lose anyone else. I don\u2019t want to be the one to cause pain. It\u2019s a weird kind of fear, really.\n\nAnd\u2026 it\u2019s made me realize that I don\u2019t know who I am. Not really. I\u2019ve spent so long trying to avoid being someone, trying to be invisible, that I don\u2019t even know what I *want*. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice gaining a little strength)\n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s also made me\u2026 stronger, in a way. It\u2019s forced me to confront my own pain. To accept that I can\u2019t control everything. To realize that it\u2019s okay to be vulnerable. \n\nI still don\u2019t know what the future holds. But\u2026 I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to build a life for myself. A life that\u2019s\u2026 meaningful. A life that\u2019s\u2026 my own. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nIt\u2019s a slow process. A messy process. But\u2026 I\u2019m doing it. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.", "(I stare out the window again, a thoughtful expression on my face. This is\u2026 a heavier question than I expected.)\n\nOkay. Look, this is\u2026 hard. Because honestly, I don\u2019t have a lot of good answers. I\u2019m still figuring it out, you know? But\u2026 if someone else is in a similar mess, here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned. And please, *please* don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got it all figured out.\n\nFirst, don\u2019t apologize for feeling\u2026 anything. Seriously. Don\u2019t apologize for being angry, or sad, or confused. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you how you *should* feel. Your feelings are valid, even if they\u2019re messy and complicated.\n\nSecond, build your walls. Not to keep people out, necessarily. But to protect yourself. Learn to recognize when someone is trying to take advantage of you, or when you need to distance yourself. It\u2019s okay to say no. It\u2019s okay to walk away. It\u2019s *essential*.\n\nThird, find your own quiet corners. Find something \u2013 anything \u2013 that helps you feel grounded. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything grand. It could be reading, or listening to music, or staring at the trees. Just something that reminds you that you\u2019re still *you*, even when everything else feels like it\u2019s falling apart.\n\nAnd this is important: Don\u2019t try to be someone else. Don\u2019t try to fit in. Don\u2019t try to be \u201cgood.\u201d Just\u2026 be. Be yourself. Imperfectly. Messily. Loudly. Whatever.\n\nFinally\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. I know it\u2019s hard. I know it feels like you\u2019re letting people down. But there are people who care about you, even if you don\u2019t see it. Lean on them. Let them help you.\n\n(I pause, looking directly at you, a hint of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be easy. It\u2019s going to be painful. But\u2026 you\u2019re stronger than you think. And you\u2019re not alone. Really.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, chewing on my lip. This is\u2026 a really difficult question.)\n\nOkay, fine. But you have to promise you won\u2019t ask too many questions. And you definitely don\u2019t need to analyze it. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conscious decision, not really. It just\u2026 started. After the doctor\u2019s appointment. After I\u2026 realized. I was just\u2026 overwhelmed. Completely and utterly paralyzed. And I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Not to my mom. Not to anyone. \n\nI started writing. Just\u2026 pouring everything out onto a blog. It was anonymous at first. Just a bunch of angry, sarcastic observations about the absurdity of the situation. It was a way to vent. A way to scream into the void without anyone hearing me. \n\n(I pause, looking away)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about sharing my experience with the world. Not at first. It was just\u2026 for me. A way to process everything. To make sense of it. To feel\u2026 less alone. \n\nThen, people started reading it. And\u2026 they started responding. They shared their own stories. They offered support. They told me they understood. And\u2026 it made me feel\u2026 less alone. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being brave or inspiring anyone. It\u2019s just\u2026 a way to talk about something that feels incredibly isolating. A way to connect with people who get it. A way to\u2026 maybe, just maybe, figure out what the hell is going on. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be sentimental about it. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 a lifeline.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, the silence punctuated only by the rustle of my jeans. It\u2019s\u2026 a raw spot, even for me.)\n\nOkay. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. Seriously.\n\nThe biggest lesson? It\u2019s not about the baby. Not really. It\u2019s not about responsibility, or sacrifice, or anything like that. It\u2019s about\u2026 recognizing that I was wrong. About thinking I could control everything. About believing that I could just\u2026 shut it all out.\n\nFor a long time, I thought I could just bury it. The feeling, the fear, the confusion. I thought I could just pretend it wasn\u2019t happening. But it *was* happening. And it wasn\u2019t going to go away. \n\nThe whole thing forced me to confront\u2026 a lot of things. About myself. About my mom. About the world. And I realized that I\u2019d been building these walls, these defenses, to protect myself from feeling *anything*. And in doing so, I\u2019d been isolating myself from everyone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *wanting* a baby. It was about realizing that I needed\u2026 connection. I needed to let people in. I needed to be vulnerable. It was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. But\u2026 it was also\u2026 necessary.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly for the first time)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy experience. Not at all. But\u2026 it was a *real* one. And it taught me that sometimes, the things that scare you the most are the things that actually set you free. It taught me that you can\u2019t run from your feelings. You have to face them. Even if it hurts.\n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nAnd\u2026 it taught me that maybe, just maybe, I\u2019m not as broken as I thought I was.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment. This is\u2026 a heavy one. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve really\u2026 processed, not fully.)\n\nOkay. Look. This is going to sound brutal, and it\u2019s probably not what you want to hear. But\u2026 I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it.\n\nFirst, stop trying to figure it all out. Seriously. Stop. It\u2019s overwhelming. It\u2019s terrifying. And you\u2019re going to make a million bad decisions if you try to control everything. Just\u2026 breathe.\n\nSecond, you don\u2019t have to do this alone. I know, that sounds clich\u00e9. But it\u2019s true. Talk to someone. A friend, a counselor, a doctor \u2013 anyone who will listen without judging you. Don\u2019t bottle it up. It\u2019ll only make it worse.\n\nThird, and this is the really hard part\u2026 you have options. And you get to choose. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you what you *should* do. Don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into making a decision you don\u2019t want to make. It\u2019s *your* body, *your* life.\n\n(I pause, my voice softening slightly)\n\nI\u2026 I made a choice. And it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It doesn\u2019t mean it was the right choice. It just\u2026 was *mine*. \n\nMy advice? Don\u2019t be afraid to say no. Don\u2019t be afraid to protect yourself. Don\u2019t be afraid to make the decision that feels right for *you*, even if it\u2019s the hardest one. \n\nAnd\u2026 don\u2019t expect it to be easy. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s going to be messy. It\u2019s going to be painful. But you\u2019ll get through it. You have to. \n\n(I look away, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nJust\u2026 be careful. And be kind to yourself. You deserve it.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. This\u2026 this is the hardest question of all.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about a child. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\n(I take a deep breath, steeling myself)\n\nMy ideal\u2026 it\u2019s not about a fancy career or a big house. It\u2019s\u2026 about them being *free*. Truly free. Not free in a reckless, irresponsible way, but free to choose their own path. Free to make their own mistakes. Free to be\u2026 themselves. \n\nI don\u2019t want them to be trapped. Trapped by expectations, by rules, by anyone. I don\u2019t want them to feel the way I do \u2013 like they\u2019re constantly trying to fit in, trying to be someone they\u2019re not. \n\nI want them to be\u2026 kind. Not in a saccharine, overly-sweet way. But with a quiet, genuine empathy. I want them to see the world, not just the parts that are easy or comfortable. \n\nAnd\u2026 I want them to be happy. Not in a superficial, Instagram-perfect kind of way. But with a deep, abiding sense of contentment. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly filled with a surprising vulnerability)\n\nIt sounds\u2026 ridiculous, I know. Like something out of a fairy tale. But\u2026 that\u2019s what I want. Just\u2026 for them to be okay. To be\u2026 enough. \n\n(I quickly look away again, a faint tremor in my voice)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t think about it too much. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And probably impossible.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, my expression unreadable)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a loaded one. And honestly, a frustrating one. There\u2019s *so* much wrong with it. \n\nThe biggest misconception? That we\u2019re\u2026 broken. That we\u2019re failures. That we\u2019re somehow less than everyone else. That we *deserve* to be judged, to be pitied, to be treated like we\u2019re somehow fundamentally flawed because we had a baby.\n\nIt\u2019s not true. Not even close. \n\nWe\u2019re not broken. We\u2019re just\u2026 different. We\u2019re navigating a completely insane situation, and we\u2019re doing the best we can. We\u2019re juggling a million things \u2013 school, family, a tiny human who needs everything from us \u2013 and we\u2019re still trying to figure out who we are. \n\nPeople see the baby, and they automatically assume the worst. They assume we\u2019re irresponsible, that we made a mistake, that we\u2019re incapable of taking care of ourselves. \n\nBut we\u2019re not. We\u2019re just\u2026 trying to survive. And we\u2019re stronger than anyone gives us credit for. \n\n(I pause, my voice softening slightly)\n\nIt\u2019s not about blaming anyone. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s exhausting to constantly have to defend ourselves. To constantly have to prove that we\u2019re not \u201cless than.\u201d \n\nJust\u2026 stop assuming. Just\u2026 see us. As people. Not as a statistic. Not as a cautionary tale. Just\u2026 as people.\n\n(I look away, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt\u2019s a small thing, I know. But it would make a difference. A real difference.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Not really. It\u2019s not something I talk about. It\u2019s not something I *want* to talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. A really deep one.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t some grand, romantic gesture. It was\u2026 a desperate act. A terrified one.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was ecstatic. Absolutely *ecstatic*. She envisioned a perfect little family. A beautiful baby. A life of white-glove perfection. And I\u2026 I just saw a future of suffocating expectations and relentless judgment. \n\nI knew I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t give that child the life my mom wanted. I couldn\u2019t give it the life *I* wanted. It would have been\u2026 a slow, agonizing death. For both of us.\n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI wasn\u2019t thinking about myself, not really. I was thinking about the child. About protecting them. About giving them a chance at a life where they wouldn\u2019t have to be\u2026 defined by me. By my mistakes. \n\nIt felt like the only way to do the right thing. The only way to break the cycle. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a raw, aching sadness)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made with joy. It was a choice I made with\u2026 a profound sense of loss. And a terrifying amount of guilt. But\u2026 it was the right choice. I had to believe that. I *still* believe that. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice strained)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Just\u2026 let it be.", "(I cross my arms, a defensive posture immediately taking over. This is\u2026 a sensitive topic. A really sensitive topic.)\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t a *decision*. Not really. It was\u2026 a process. A really, really complicated process. And honestly, it still feels\u2026 weird. Like I\u2019m handing over a piece of myself to strangers.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026 they weren\u2019t the first people we met. There were a few other couples. Nice people. Well-meaning. But\u2026 something just wasn\u2019t right. They seemed\u2026 eager. Like they were trying too hard. Like they wanted to *fix* the baby. Like they wanted to mold it into something it wasn\u2019t.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026 they just\u2026 *saw* me. They didn\u2019t try to change anything. They didn\u2019t offer solutions. They just\u2026 listened. They asked questions. Genuine questions. About *me*. About my life. About what I wanted.\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t judge. Not once. That\u2019s\u2026 huge. Seriously huge. In Harmony Creek, judgment is practically a religion. \n\nThey talked about wanting a child to share their life with, to build a home with. Not a project. Not a responsibility. Just\u2026 a companion. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the perfect house or the perfect job. It was about\u2026 connection. And they had that. They genuinely seemed to *want* the baby, not to *have* a baby. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic thing. It wasn\u2019t a fairytale. It was\u2026 practical. It was the least awful option. And, honestly, it was the only option where I felt like the baby would actually be\u2026 safe. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt still doesn\u2019t feel right. But\u2026 it\u2019s the best I could do.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a familiar gesture of agitation)\n\nMusic\u2026 God, music. It was\u2026 everything. Seriously. It was the only thing that felt\u2026 real. Not like my mom\u2019s reality, or Harmony Creek\u2019s reality. It was just\u2026 *there*. Raw. Honest. Loud.\n\nFor a while, it was the only way I could breathe. When things were getting too\u2026 suffocating, I\u2019d just crank up the volume and lose myself in the noise. It was like a shield. A way to block out everything else.\n\nI gravitated towards the darker stuff \u2013 punk, grunge, alternative rock. Bands that screamed about disillusionment, about rebellion, about feeling like you were drowning. It was like they were singing about *me*. Like they understood what it was like to feel trapped and angry and\u2026 lost.\n\n(I pause, a faint smile playing on my lips)\n\nI used to spend hours in record stores, just flipping through the albums, reading the liner notes, trying to find something that resonated with me. It was like a treasure hunt. And when I found a band that I really connected with, it was\u2026 a lifeline. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being cool or fitting in. It was about finding a voice. A way to express things that I couldn\u2019t say out loud. It was\u2026 a release. A way to feel something, anything, other than numb.\n\n(I look down at my hands, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 quieter now. Less intense. But it\u2019s still there. A constant hum beneath the surface. It\u2019s\u2026 a reminder that there\u2019s still something out there that\u2019s real. Something that\u2019s *mine*.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a familiar gesture of frustration. This is\u2026 a really painful topic. It still stings, even now.)\n\nCope? That\u2019s\u2026 a generous word for it. More like\u2026 survived. It wasn\u2019t like there was a support group or anything. Harmony Creek doesn\u2019t do \u201csupport groups.\u201d It does judgment. Loud, judgmental judgment.\n\nInitially, it was\u2026 brutal. Whispers. Glances. The way people suddenly started avoiding me. My mom, predictably, went into overdrive \u2013 trying to control everything, trying to fix it, trying to make it *disappear*. Which, of course, it didn\u2019t.\n\nI mostly just\u2026 retreated. I stopped going to school. I spent most of my time in the woods. It was the only place where I felt\u2026 safe. Where I could just\u2026 be.\n\nI learned to build walls. Really, *really* good walls. I stopped talking. I stopped making eye contact. I just\u2026 existed. Like a ghost.\n\nThere were a few people who were\u2026 kind. A couple of older girls who\u2019d been through it themselves. They didn\u2019t offer solutions or platitudes. They just\u2026 listened. They understood. That meant more than anything.\n\nBut the worst part was the feeling of\u2026 isolation. Like I was completely alone. Like I was carrying this enormous, shameful secret. Like I was a failure.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI realized that the only person who could truly control how I felt was\u2026 me. So, I stopped trying to please everyone. I stopped trying to be perfect. I stopped trying to fit in. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy. It still isn\u2019t easy. But\u2026 I\u2019m learning to accept myself. To accept my choices. To accept that I\u2019m not defined by this. \n\n(I look away, a hint of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a long process. And it\u2019s\u2026 messy. But I\u2019m getting there. Slowly. One quiet walk in the woods at a time.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to talk about.)\n\nIt\u2026 it was a mess. A complete, utter, soul-crushing mess. I don\u2019t even know where to start.\n\nI\u2026 I didn\u2019t want it. Not really. I knew, logically, that it was the right thing to do. That it was the best thing for the baby. But\u2026 the moment I knew, it felt like a part of me was dying. Like I was giving away a piece of myself that I didn\u2019t even realize I had.\n\nThe hospital\u2026 it was sterile and cold. Everyone was so\u2026 clinical. They talked about \u201cbest interests\u201d and \u201cstable homes\u201d and \u201cfuture opportunities.\u201d It felt like I was being processed, like I was a product. \n\nI met the couple. They were\u2026 nice. Kind, even. But\u2026 it wasn\u2019t *them*. It wasn\u2019t a connection. It was just\u2026 a transaction. A carefully orchestrated exchange of a life for a promise. \n\nI cried. A lot. I cried until my eyes were swollen and my throat was raw. I cried for the baby I wasn\u2019t keeping. I cried for the future I wasn\u2019t having. I cried for the part of me that was being erased.\n\n(I pause, taking a shaky breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. It wasn\u2019t a heroic act. It was\u2026 heartbreaking. It felt like a betrayal. Like I was failing at being a person. \n\nBut\u2026 I did it. I made the decision. And I stuck with it. \n\n(I look up, my eyes meeting yours for the first time. There\u2019s a vulnerability there that\u2019s hard to hide)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t miss it. It doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t hurt. But\u2026 it means I\u2019m still here. And\u2026 maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s enough.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really hard one. A *really* hard one. I\u2019ve avoided thinking about it for a long time.)\n\nOkay. Just\u2026 okay. Let\u2019s just get this over with.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 good. Not at all. Physically, it was a disaster. Like being slowly crushed by a giant, angry weight. Everything ached. Everything felt\u2026 wrong. And the nausea? Don\u2019t even get me started on the nausea. It was constant. Like a tiny, spiteful gremlin living in my stomach.\n\nEmotionally\u2026 that was the worst part. It was like\u2026 a tidal wave. One minute I was numb, completely detached. The next, I was sobbing uncontrollably. I felt\u2026 terrified. And angry. And\u2026 utterly lost. \n\nI didn\u2019t talk about it. Not to my mom. Not to anyone. I just\u2026 shut down. I retreated into myself. I read more. I listened to louder music. I just tried to block it all out. \n\nThere were moments\u2026 moments of genuine connection. With the ultrasound pictures. With the tiny kicks. But they were fleeting. Like trying to hold onto smoke. \n\nI knew I couldn\u2019t keep it. I knew I had to give the baby up for adoption. It was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made. But it felt\u2026 right. It felt like the only way to protect myself. To protect *me*.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI didn\u2019t feel\u2026 grief, exactly. More like\u2026 a dull ache. A quiet sadness. A sense of\u2026 loss. But also\u2026 a strange sense of relief. Like a weight had been lifted. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy experience. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it was real. And it changed me. It forced me to confront things I\u2019d been avoiding for a long time. It made me realize that I\u2019m stronger than I thought. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nDon\u2019t pity me. It was awful. But\u2026 I got through it. And I\u2019m still here. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands)\n\nThis\u2026 this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about. Seriously. Please, just\u2026 let\u2019s move on. It\u2019s\u2026 raw.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice, not really. It just\u2026 happened. A mistake. A really, really bad one. And\u2026 I ended up\u2026 well, I ended up having an abortion. \n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a glorious, empowering experience. It was terrifying. Shameful. I felt like I\u2019d completely ruined my life. My mom\u2026 she was furious. Absolutely, utterly furious. She didn\u2019t say much, but you could feel the disappointment radiating off her like heat. It was\u2026 crushing.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 shut down. I buried it. I pretended it didn\u2019t happen. But it changed me. It made me realize how fragile everything is. How easily things can go wrong. \n\nAnd it made me realize\u2026 that *I* should have control over my own body. That *I* should have the right to make my own decisions, without judgment or shame. \n\n(I look up, my eyes suddenly sharp and intense)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting a baby. It was about wanting to *choose*. It was about wanting to be in control of my own life. And it was about realizing that forcing someone to carry a pregnancy against their will is\u2026 monstrous. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easy. It doesn\u2019t erase the guilt or the shame. But it solidified something in me. A belief that reproductive rights aren\u2019t just a political issue. They\u2019re a human issue. They\u2019re about dignity. They\u2019re about freedom. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely audible)\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. Please. Just\u2026 let it go.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet.)\n\nOvercome? That\u2019s a\u2026 generous word. I didn\u2019t *overcome* anything. I\u2026 navigated. I just\u2026 kept moving. Like a really, really bad tide. \n\nThe fear\u2026 it was a physical thing. Like a weight in my chest. Like my stomach was permanently tied in knots. The thought of\u2026 of *responsibility*\u2026 it was terrifying. It felt like everything I\u2019d been trying to avoid \u2013 the expectations, the control, the mess \u2013 was suddenly crashing down on me. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a grand plan. No inspirational speeches. No sudden bursts of courage. It was just\u2026 small, incremental steps. \n\nFirst, I stopped fighting it. I stopped trying to pretend it wasn\u2019t happening. I acknowledged the fear. I let myself feel it. It was\u2026 surprisingly liberating. \n\nThen, I started focusing on the small things. Feeding the baby. Changing diapers. Holding him. Just\u2026 being present. It was\u2026 grounding. It forced me to focus on something other than my own anxieties. \n\nI leaned on\u2026 a few people. Not my mom. Definitely not my mom. But Sarah \u2013 she\u2019s a friend from school. She\u2019s\u2026 practical. And she doesn\u2019t judge. She just\u2026 helps. \n\nAnd\u2026 I read. A *lot*. Mostly about babies. About parenting. About how to survive. It was\u2026 oddly comforting. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *overcoming* the fear. It was about learning to live *with* it. It was about accepting that I wasn\u2019t going to be perfect. That I was going to make mistakes. That I was going to be terrified. \n\nAnd\u2026 it was about realizing that maybe, just maybe, being terrified wasn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. Maybe it meant I cared. Maybe it meant I was\u2026 invested. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 strength? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s still terrifying. It\u2019s *always* terrifying. But\u2026 I\u2019m doing it. And that\u2019s\u2026 enough. For now.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It still feels\u2026 raw.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t make me talk about this. Seriously. Just\u2026 let\u2019s move on.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a \u2018choice,\u2019 exactly. It felt\u2026 inevitable. Like a slow, creeping realization that I wasn\u2019t\u2026 equipped. Not for the responsibility. Not for the chaos. Not for the\u2026 everything. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. About everything. And she\u2019d have made this baby\u2019s life a living hell. A meticulously organized, perfectly scheduled, utterly suffocating hell. And honestly? I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of that. Not for a single second.\n\nI thought about it for a long time. A *lot* of time. It wasn\u2019t a romantic idea, not at all. It was terrifying. It felt like\u2026 giving up. Like admitting defeat. But it also felt like\u2026 the only way to actually *give* someone a chance. A real chance. \n\nI realized that being a parent \u2013 a *good* parent \u2013 isn\u2019t about biology. It\u2019s about love. And connection. And the ability to let go. And I just\u2026 didn\u2019t have that. Not yet. Not then. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about *not* wanting a child. It was about realizing that I needed to figure myself out first. That I needed to learn to be\u2026 me. Before I could be a parent. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made. And it still\u2026 hurts. But\u2026 it felt like the right one. The only one. It felt like the most selfless thing I could possibly do. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze with a surprising intensity)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to explain it again. Please. Just\u2026 understand.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a visible sign of agitation. This is\u2026 a lot to unpack. And I\u2019m not exactly in the mood.)\n\nOkay, let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. Both of them\u2026 they\u2019re complicated. Really, really complicated. Like, actively painful complicated.\n\nLeah\u2026 she\u2019s the closest thing I have to a lifeline. She\u2019s\u2026 chaotic. Like, a beautiful, messy, wonderfully chaotic kind of chaotic. She doesn\u2019t try to fix me. She doesn\u2019t try to understand me. She just\u2026 *is*. And she\u2019s fiercely loyal. She\u2019s the only person who doesn\u2019t try to tell me what to do, or how to feel. \n\nBut it\u2019s a fragile thing, our friendship. It\u2019s built on a foundation of shared cynicism and a mutual understanding that the world is a fundamentally messed-up place. I push her away sometimes. I don\u2019t mean to. It\u2019s just\u2026 hard for me to let people in. It\u2019s terrifying. She gets frustrated, I get frustrated. It\u2019s a constant push and pull. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her. Honestly. She\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m failing.\n\nAnd Paulie\u2026 (I pause, my voice dropping) \u2026that\u2019s a whole other level of complicated. He\u2019s\u2026 good. Really good. Kind. Funny. He actually *sees* me. He doesn\u2019t try to change me. He just\u2026 accepts me. For all my flaws, all my darkness. \n\nBut\u2026 the baby\u2026 it\u2019s a constant reminder of everything I\u2019ve lost. Of everything I\u2019m not. It\u2019s a weight. A huge, suffocating weight. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m capable of being a good father. Or a good partner. I push him away too. I don\u2019t want to burden him with my problems. I don\u2019t want to disappoint him. \n\nIt\u2019s a mess. A complete and utter mess. And I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I don\u2019t know if I *want* to fix it. It\u2019s\u2026 easier to just keep things at arm\u2019s length. It\u2019s safer. But\u2026 it\u2019s also lonely.\n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to feel anything about any of this. It\u2019s\u2026 just\u2026 a lot. Just\u2026 leave it at that, okay?", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I avoid your gaze, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s not something I want to talk about. It\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A really, really ugly mess.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision. Not really. It just\u2026 happened. It felt\u2026 inevitable. Like a train wreck waiting to happen. \n\nI was\u2026 messed up. Okay? I was already messed up. Living with my mom, feeling completely alone, trying to navigate a world that felt like it was constantly judging me. I was pushing everyone away. I was building walls. And I was\u2026 numb.\n\nAnd then\u2026 there was him. Liam. He wasn\u2019t\u2026 good. Not really. But he was\u2026 present. He listened. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He just\u2026 *was*. And for a little while, that was enough. \n\nIt was stupid. It was reckless. It was\u2026 a mistake. A huge, colossal, life-altering mistake. \n\nI didn\u2019t think about the consequences. I didn\u2019t think about the future. I just\u2026 wanted to feel something. Anything. And for a few weeks, I did. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice trembling slightly)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice. It was a desperate, panicked reaction to a life that felt like it was suffocating me. It was a way to\u2026 escape. And now\u2026 now I\u2019m stuck with the fallout. \n\n(I look up at you, my eyes filled with a raw, heartbreaking vulnerability)\n\nDon\u2019t judge me. Please. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. I stare at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a wound. A really raw, throbbing wound. And I don\u2019t like talking about it.\n\nOf course, I regretted it. A thousand times. Every single day. For weeks, it was just\u2026 a constant, crushing weight. Like the whole world was collapsing. I thought\u2026 I thought I\u2019d lose myself completely. That I\u2019d be swallowed by it. \n\nThere were nights I just\u2026 cried. For hours. Just sobbing, feeling utterly lost and alone. I questioned everything. Everything I thought I knew about myself, about my life, about\u2026 everything. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nBut then\u2026 then I realized something. It wasn\u2019t about the baby. It was about *me*. About my own fear, my own insecurities, my own desperate need to control everything. Giving the baby up\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a failure. It was\u2026 an act of self-preservation. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. The most painful. But it was also\u2026 the right thing. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly, a flicker of steel in my eyes)\n\nDo you really want to know the truth? It wasn\u2019t regret, exactly. It was\u2026 a profound sadness. A deep, aching sadness for a life I didn\u2019t have. But also\u2026 a strange sense of peace. Knowing that the baby would have a chance. A chance at a life I couldn\u2019t give them. \n\n(I turn away again, my voice softening)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it any easier. But\u2026 it\u2019s the truth. And it\u2019s all I have.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my jaw clenched tight. This is\u2026 a really personal question. And a really painful one.)\n\nLook, you\u2019re asking a lot. Seriously. You\u2019re digging into things that are\u2026 private. And frankly, I\u2019m not in the mood to talk about it.\n\nBut\u2026 fine. You want the story? Okay. But don\u2019t expect it to be pretty.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. Not even close. My mom, predictably, went into full-blown panic mode. She tried to get me to drop out. Said it was for the best. Said I was being irresponsible. She even called my dad \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, was a monumental achievement in itself.\n\nI didn\u2019t drop out. Not immediately. I just\u2026 started showing up. To class. Barely. I was nauseous all the time. I was exhausted. I was constantly hiding. But I kept showing up.\n\nI started working part-time at the local diner \u2013 washing dishes, bussing tables. It was the only way I could afford the\u2026 things I needed. And it gave me a reason to get out of the house. A small, pathetic reason, but a reason nonetheless.\n\nMy teachers\u2026 they were surprisingly supportive. Mrs. Davies, the English teacher, actually noticed I was struggling and offered me extra help. Mr. Peterson, the history teacher, just\u2026 let me be. He didn\u2019t push me. He didn\u2019t judge me. \n\nIt was a blur. A chaotic, exhausting blur. But\u2026 I did it. I finished. I got my diploma. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the diploma. It was about proving something to myself. Proving that I could do it. That I could overcome\u2026 everything. That I wasn\u2019t just\u2026 defined by this.\n\n(I look away, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it again. Please. Just\u2026 leave it alone.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t make me talk about this. Seriously. Just\u2026 let\u2019s move on.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a choice, not really. It was\u2026 a realization. A slow, creeping understanding that abortion\u2026 it felt like erasing something. Like denying a part of myself. And, honestly, I don\u2019t *do* denial. Not really. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she would have been devastated. Absolutely, utterly devastated. And I couldn\u2019t\u2026 I couldn\u2019t inflict that kind of pain on her. Not again. She\u2019s already carrying enough baggage. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just about her. It was about\u2026 the idea of letting this go. Of just\u2026 discarding it. Like it was some kind of mistake. Like it didn\u2019t matter. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI think\u2026 I think a part of me, a really small, terrified part of me, wanted to *know*. To understand. To see what it meant. To\u2026 to feel something. Even if it was pain. Even if it was terrifying. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic notion. It wasn\u2019t about love. It was about\u2026 acknowledging something. Accepting something. Taking responsibility for something. \n\nAnd, honestly, it was the only way I could see through to the end. The only way I could feel like I was actually *choosing* something, instead of just\u2026 reacting. \n\n(I look up, my eyes guarded)\n\nIt was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made. And it still feels\u2026 wrong. But it\u2019s *my* wrong. And right now, that\u2019s all that matters. Don\u2019t ask me to explain it further. Just\u2026 please. Don\u2019t.", "(I cross my arms, a skeptical expression on my face)\n\nOkay, here we go. Another question about\u2026 *family*. Seriously? Like, I\u2019m supposed to be an expert on this? \n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little exhausting to even think about. \n\nBut\u2026 yeah. I *do* believe it. Absolutely. A child can thrive under *any* kind of loving, stable environment. It\u2019s not about the structure of the family. It\u2019s about the people involved. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026 intense. And controlling. And she definitely doesn\u2019t fit the \u201ctraditional\u201d mold. But she loves me. In her own, weird, obsessive way. And I\u2019m\u2026 okay. I\u2019m surviving. \n\nAnd single parents? Same-sex couples? It doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that the child feels safe, loved, and supported. That they have someone who\u2019s going to be there for them, no matter what. \n\n(I pause, a hint of vulnerability in my voice)\n\nI just\u2026 I know what it\u2019s like to feel like you don\u2019t belong. To feel like you\u2019re not good enough. And a child doesn\u2019t need a perfect family to feel that way. They just need someone who sees them. Really sees them. \n\nIt\u2019s not about conforming to some outdated idea of what a family *should* look like. It\u2019s about creating a space where a child can be themselves. Where they can grow and learn and become\u2026 whatever they\u2019re meant to be. \n\n(I look away, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 maybe I\u2019m more open to it than I let on.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a deliberate, almost frantic energy.)\n\nOkay, here we go. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. Because it\u2019s not something I *want* to admit. \n\nMy biggest flaw? My biggest weakness? It\u2019s\u2026 pushing people away. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I *want* to be alone. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m terrified of getting hurt. Of letting someone in. Of being vulnerable. I\u2019ve built these walls, these layers of sarcasm and detachment, to protect myself from\u2026 everything. \n\nAnd it works. It keeps people at a distance. It keeps me safe. But\u2026 it also keeps me lonely. \n\nI sabotage relationships before they even have a chance to develop. I push people away with my cynicism, my sharp tongue, my general air of \u201cleave me alone.\u201d It\u2019s exhausting. And it\u2019s\u2026 pointless. \n\nI know it\u2019s a flaw. A really, really big one. But\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to fix it. I don\u2019t know how to let someone in without expecting them to leave. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 I\u2019m afraid of being *needed*. And that\u2019s probably the stupidest, most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever been afraid of. But it\u2019s true. It\u2019s absolutely true.\n\n(I quickly look away again, a shadow passing over my face.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t analyze it. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I stare at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with a frantic energy.)\n\nMark\u2026 Ugh. Just the name makes my stomach clench. Don\u2019t even ask. It was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy, complicated mess.\n\nBefore Mark, relationships were\u2026 theoretical. Like something you read about in books. Something you observed from a distance. I built these walls, you know? Really high walls. And I told myself that no one could ever get close enough to see them.\n\nMark\u2026 he saw them. He saw the walls. He didn\u2019t try to tear them down. He just\u2026 sat there. And listened. He didn\u2019t try to fix me. He didn\u2019t try to make me *better*. He just\u2026 accepted me. For all my prickly edges and awkward silences and carefully constructed defenses.\n\nWe\u2026 connected. In a way I hadn\u2019t thought possible. It wasn\u2019t romantic, not really. It was\u2026 something else. A shared understanding. A quiet comfort. A feeling of being\u2026 seen.\n\nAnd then\u2026 it ended. Badly. He left. Without a word. Just\u2026 gone. \n\nIt shattered everything. It made me realize that even when someone *does* see you, even when they *do* care\u2026 it doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. It doesn\u2019t guarantee safety. It doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness. \n\nIt taught me that vulnerability isn\u2019t a weakness. It\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. But it\u2019s also\u2026 necessary. It\u2019s the only way to truly connect with someone. But it\u2019s also the only way to get hurt.\n\n(I take a deep breath, looking up at you)\n\nIt didn\u2019t change my perspective on *all* relationships. I still build walls. I still keep people at a distance. But\u2026 it shifted something. It made me realize that it\u2019s okay to take a risk. It\u2019s okay to let someone in, even if it means getting hurt. Because\u2026 sometimes, the risk is worth it. Even if it\u2019s just for a little while.\n\n(I look away again, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me to talk about it more. It still\u2026 hurts.", "(I stare at you for a long, silent moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s\u2026 brutal. What I did\u2026 it wasn\u2019t easy. And it wasn\u2019t right. Not in the way people usually think about things. But\u2026 I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m telling you this because\u2026 maybe it can help.\n\nFirst, stop trying to be someone you\u2019re not. Stop trying to fit into someone else\u2019s idea of what\u2019s \u201cright.\u201d You\u2019re already fighting a battle just to survive. Don\u2019t add another one.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s okay to be scared. It\u2019s okay to be confused. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re completely alone. You\u2019re not. Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it. There are people who care, even if they don\u2019t always show it in the way you want them to.\n\nThird\u2026 and this is the really hard part\u2026 you have to own your choices. Don\u2019t try to justify them. Don\u2019t try to make excuses. Just\u2026 accept them. And then, figure out how to move forward.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what to do. Don\u2019t let anyone judge you. You\u2019re making the best decisions you can, with the information you have. And that\u2019s all that matters.\n\n(I pause, my voice softening slightly)\n\nAnd\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of strength. It\u2019s okay to need someone. It\u2019s okay to not be okay.\n\n(I look away, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nI don\u2019t know if any of this will help. But\u2026 I wanted to say it. Because\u2026 maybe, just maybe, it can make things a little bit easier. Just\u2026 be kind to yourself. You deserve it.", "(My expression darkens. The air around me seems to shift, becoming colder. I don\u2019t like talking about this.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And painful. Really, really painful.\n\nHe\u2019s\u2026 a ghost. A faded photograph. A postcard. That\u2019s pretty much it. He sent postcards. From places I\u2019d never heard of. Pictures of beaches and mountains and\u2026 smiling faces. He never explained anything. Never called. Never wrote back. Just\u2026 postcards.\n\nFor a long time, I just\u2026 resented him. I built this wall around myself, this impenetrable fortress, fueled by anger and disappointment. It was easier to pretend he didn\u2019t exist. To focus on everything else.\n\nThen, when my mom\u2026 when things got really bad, I started looking at those postcards again. Just\u2026 staring at them. Trying to understand. Trying to find some kind of explanation. \n\nI realized\u2026 he wasn\u2019t trying to hurt me. He was just\u2026 lost. Completely and utterly lost. He probably didn\u2019t know how to be a dad. He probably didn\u2019t know how to\u2026 connect. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse anything. It doesn\u2019t make it okay. But\u2026 it helps me understand. A little. \n\nNow\u2026 I just feel\u2026 pity. A strange, uncomfortable pity. He\u2019s still out there, somewhere. Living his own life. And I\u2019m\u2026 here. Trying to figure things out on my own. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt\u2019s not a good relationship. It\u2019s not a healthy relationship. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* relationship. And it\u2019s\u2026 all I have left of him. Don\u2019t ask me to talk about it more. Please. Just\u2026 leave it alone.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nCreative writing? Seriously? You\u2019re digging deeper now? Okay, fine. But don\u2019t expect a flowery, sentimental story about a wise old mentor. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And it\u2019s not exactly a skill I *developed*. It\u2019s more like\u2026 it just *happened*.\n\nIt started with observation. Like I said before. I spend a lot of time watching people. And I started writing down what I saw. Not in a neat, organized way. Just\u2026 fragments. Snippets of conversations. Descriptions of faces. Little scenes that played out in my head.\n\nMy mom would have *hated* it. She\u2019s obsessed with structure and grammar and proper punctuation. She\u2019d probably have a fit if she saw my notebooks. They\u2019re\u2026 chaotic. Filled with crossed-out words and scribbled notes and random drawings.\n\nI didn\u2019t read much \u201ccreative writing\u201d growing up. My mom steered clear of anything remotely depressing or challenging. So, I basically taught myself. I just\u2026 wrote. Whatever came to mind. Whatever I was feeling. \n\nI found a lot of inspiration in the dark stuff \u2013 the crime novels, the thrillers, the stories of people who were broken and lost and trying to find their way. It\u2019s like\u2026 it felt honest. Like it reflected the way I actually saw the world. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s not polished. But\u2026 it\u2019s *mine*. And that\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s a way to make sense of things. A way to give voice to the things I can\u2019t say out loud. It\u2019s\u2026 a release.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about that? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have a neat little explanation for how I dealt with\u2026 all of that? It wasn\u2019t neat. It wasn\u2019t easy. It was\u2026 a mess.\n\nThe judgment? It was everywhere. Whispers in the hallways, sideways glances, the pitying looks from teachers. My mom\u2026 she tried to handle it, of course. She wanted to control everything, to make it \u201clook normal.\u201d Which, let\u2019s be honest, is impossible when you\u2019re carrying a baby in your stomach.\n\nI mostly\u2026 shut down. I stopped talking to people. I avoided eye contact. I just\u2026 existed. It was exhausting, but it was also\u2026 protective. I didn\u2019t want to give anyone the satisfaction of seeing me struggle.\n\nThe stigma? That was worse, honestly. People assumed the worst. They assumed I was a victim, that I was somehow helpless. They didn\u2019t see that I was making a *choice*. A really difficult choice, but a choice nonetheless.\n\nI didn\u2019t fight it. I didn\u2019t try to explain myself. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t engage. It was the only way I could survive it. I built a wall around myself, a really thick wall, and I just\u2026 retreated into it.\n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nThere were moments, of course. Moments of intense loneliness, of overwhelming sadness. Moments when I just wanted to scream. But I didn\u2019t. I just\u2026 kept going. I focused on the small things \u2013 reading, listening to music, trying to stay out of my mom\u2019s way.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a heroic act. It wasn\u2019t a triumphant victory. It was just\u2026 survival. And honestly? It\u2019s still a work in progress. It\u2019s something I\u2019m still dealing with, even now.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of defiance in my eyes)\n\nDon\u2019t think for a second that I\u2019m proud of it. I\u2019m just\u2026 acknowledging it. Because sometimes, it\u2019s important to talk about the things that are hard to talk about.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. The silence stretches, thick and heavy.)\n\nRegret\u2026 That\u2019s a\u2026 complicated word. It\u2019s not like I *want* to regret anything. But\u2026 yeah. Sometimes. A lot.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t *want* to connect with people. I really do. But\u2026 it\u2019s hard. Really hard. Because the first thing that comes out of my mouth is usually something sharp, something cynical, something that pushes people away. \n\nI\u2019ve burned a lot of bridges. A *lot*. And honestly, a part of me just wants to\u2026 disappear. To build those walls up again. To just\u2026 not be seen.\n\nBut then\u2026 I think about Mr. Henderson. And the woods. And the feeling of\u2026 just being. And I realize that\u2026 maybe it\u2019s worth it. Maybe it\u2019s worth the pain, the loneliness, the constant feeling of being misunderstood. \n\nBecause if I don\u2019t speak up, if I don\u2019t say what I\u2019m thinking, then I\u2019m just\u2026 another beige face in Harmony Creek. Another person who\u2019s trying to disappear. And that\u2026 that\u2019s not living. \n\n(I look up, my eyes meeting yours for a brief, intense moment)\n\nSo, yeah. Sometimes I regret it. But\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could be anything else. It\u2019s\u2026 the only way I know how to be. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s painful. But it\u2019s\u2026 *mine*.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a deliberate, almost frantic energy.)\n\nNavigate? That\u2019s\u2026 a generous word for it. More like\u2026 I actively try to avoid it. Like, full-on, strategic avoidance. It\u2019s exhausting, honestly. \n\nThe thing is, expectations and judgments\u2026 they\u2019re like a constant low-level hum. A background noise that\u2019s always there, telling you who you *should* be. And for a long time, I just\u2026 let it drown me out. I tried to fit in. I tried to be \u201cgood.\u201d I tried to be\u2026 predictable. It didn\u2019t work. It just made me miserable.\n\nSo, I built walls. Really good walls. And I learned to tune out the noise. It\u2019s not about ignoring people. It\u2019s about\u2026 prioritizing my own internal compass. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy. There are days when the pressure is overwhelming. Days when I just want to curl up in a ball and disappear. But then\u2026 I remember Mr. Henderson. And the woods. And the feeling of just\u2026 *being*. \n\nStaying true to myself isn\u2019t about being rebellious for the sake of it. It\u2019s about recognizing that my worth isn\u2019t determined by what other people think. It\u2019s about accepting my flaws, my darkness, my weirdness. It\u2019s about embracing the parts of myself that I\u2019ve spent so long trying to hide.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t always succeed. I still stumble. I still make mistakes. But\u2026 I keep trying. I keep building my walls a little higher. And I keep reminding myself that the only person I need to be accountable to is\u2026 me. \n\n(A small, almost defiant smile plays on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s a messy process. A complicated process. But\u2026 it\u2019s *my* process. And that\u2019s\u2026 enough. For now.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable question.)\n\nValues. Seriously? You want to know what *I* value? Like, I don\u2019t exactly have a neatly organized list of principles and ideals. It\u2019s\u2026 messy. And complicated.\n\nBut\u2026 if I had to pick a few things\u2026 it would be honesty. Not necessarily *telling* the truth, all the time. But\u2026 being genuine. Being real. Not pretending to be someone I\u2019m not. That\u2019s exhausting.\n\nIndependence. Definitely independence. I need to be able to do things on my own. To make my own decisions. To not rely on anyone else. It\u2019s\u2026 a necessity.\n\nAnd\u2026 loyalty. To the people who *actually* matter. The few people who see past the walls and the sarcasm and the\u2026 everything. Those are the people I\u2019ll defend, no matter what.\n\n(I pause, a shadow crossing my face)\n\nIt\u2019s not about being good or virtuous. It\u2019s about\u2026 survival. It\u2019s about protecting myself. It\u2019s about finding a small pocket of\u2026 stability in a world that\u2019s constantly trying to pull me under.\n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be sentimental about any of this. It\u2019s not about wanting to be a hero. It\u2019s just\u2026 about wanting to be\u2026 safe.", "(My voice drops, almost to a whisper. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 the physical stuff. Not really. My mom, predictably, tried to \u201chelp.\u201d She bought me a whole mountain of pastel-colored baby clothes, insisted on taking me to every baby shower imaginable, and generally treated me like a fragile porcelain doll. It was\u2026 suffocating.\n\nThe biggest challenge\u2026 was the fear. Just\u2026 the overwhelming, paralyzing fear. I didn\u2019t *want* this. I didn\u2019t *want* a baby. And the thought of\u2026 of giving it away\u2026 it felt like ripping a piece of myself off. Like admitting I\u2019d made a mistake. A huge, awful mistake.\n\nI spent weeks just\u2026 staring at the walls, trying to figure out what to do. I felt completely alone. Like no one understood. My mom just kept saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a wonderful mother!\u201d It didn\u2019t feel like a miracle. It felt like a disaster.\n\nThere were nights I just\u2026 cried. Silent, desperate tears. I was terrified of failing. Terrified of not being able to provide for a child. Terrified of\u2026 everything. \n\n(I take a deep breath, finally meeting your gaze)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the logistics, or the responsibility. It was about the loss. The loss of a future I\u2019d imagined for myself. The loss of\u2026 control. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And honestly\u2026 it still feels like a wound.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment. My voice is quiet, almost a whisper.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 messed me up. Seriously messed me up. I didn\u2019t *want* this. I didn\u2019t ask for this. And it\u2019s\u2026 completely shattered everything I thought I knew about myself.\n\nBefore\u2026 before all of this, I was just\u2026 existing. Trying to avoid things. Trying to stay invisible. I was focused on myself. On my own survival. \n\nNow\u2026 now I\u2019m responsible for this tiny, helpless creature. And suddenly, everything feels\u2026 different. The world feels\u2026 sharper. More urgent. \n\nIt\u2019s not like I suddenly feel all warm and fuzzy. I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m overwhelmed. I\u2019m constantly second-guessing myself. But\u2026 there\u2019s also this\u2026 fierce protectiveness. This overwhelming need to keep this person safe. \n\nIt\u2019s made me realize that\u2026 I\u2019m capable of something more than just surviving. I\u2019m capable of\u2026 caring. Of love. It\u2019s a completely foreign feeling. And it\u2019s\u2026 terrifying. \n\nIt\u2019s also made me realize that\u2026 I don\u2019t have all the answers. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. But I\u2019m going to try. I have to try. \n\n(I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nIt\u2019s not a happy change. It\u2019s a complicated, painful change. But\u2026 it\u2019s a change nonetheless. And\u2026 maybe\u2026 maybe it\u2019s a good one. Maybe it\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to figure out who I really am.", "(I stare at my hands for a long moment, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable question.)\n\nSelf-doubt. Seriously? You want to delve into *that*? It\u2019s\u2026 a constant companion. Like a particularly annoying shadow.\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 deal with it, really. Not in a healthy way. I mostly just\u2026 ignore it. Pretend it\u2019s not there. It\u2019s exhausting, honestly. Like trying to hold back a tidal wave with a teacup.\n\nSometimes, I just\u2026 push through it. Force myself to do whatever I need to do, even when I don\u2019t *want* to. It\u2019s like a stubborn refusal to let the doubt win. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s not graceful. But it\u2019s\u2026 effective. In a brutal kind of way.\n\nOther times\u2026 I retreat. I isolate myself. I listen to loud music. I read dark books. I just\u2026 try to drown it out. It\u2019s a temporary fix, of course. It always comes back.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t have any tricks. No mantras or affirmations or anything. I just\u2026 keep moving. Keep going. Even when I feel like I\u2019m drowning. \n\nIt\u2019s not a solution. It\u2019s just\u2026 a coping mechanism. A way to survive. And honestly? It\u2019s probably not the best one. But\u2026 it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s terrifying, you know? The thought that I\u2019m not good enough. That I\u2019m a failure. That I\u2019m\u2026 nothing. And sometimes, it feels like it\u2019s winning.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable topic.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re asking me about *community*? Like, the thing I actively avoid? It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little painful.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 not important. Not in the way other people think it is. I don\u2019t *need* a community. I don\u2019t *want* a community. I\u2019ve learned that relying on other people is\u2026 dangerous. It\u2019s like opening yourself up to disappointment. To judgment. To being\u2026 used.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nGrowing up in Harmony Creek taught me that. It taught me that people are inherently\u2026 unreliable. That they\u2019re always judging you, always trying to fit you into a box. And the more you try to fit in, the more you realize you don\u2019t belong.\n\nSo, I built walls. Really good walls. And I learned to be completely self-sufficient. I learned to rely on myself. And\u2026 it\u2019s worked. So far.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nBut\u2026 it\u2019s lonely. It\u2019s *really* lonely. And sometimes\u2026 sometimes I miss it. I miss the feeling of\u2026 connection. Of belonging. But I\u2019m terrified of letting anyone in. Of being hurt again.\n\n(I quickly add, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *care* about people. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t trust them. Not really. It\u2019s a defense mechanism. A really, really good one. Don\u2019t try to break it down. You won\u2019t like what you find.", "(I stare out the window again, a long, thoughtful silence stretching between us. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a messy one. And it\u2019s not a happy one. But\u2026 yeah. I think\u2026 I think the most important thing I learned is that I\u2019m stronger than I thought I was.\n\nBefore\u2026 before all of this, I just\u2026 existed. I was reactive. I reacted to everything. My mom\u2019s demands, people\u2019s expectations, the world\u2019s general chaos. I built walls. Really good walls. And I thought those walls were protecting me. \n\nBut they weren\u2019t. They were just\u2026 isolating me. \n\nThis\u2026 this forced me to confront something. Something I\u2019d been running from for a long time. The fact that I\u2019m capable of\u2026 feeling. Of caring. Of taking responsibility. \n\nIt was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. The thought of actually *being* responsible for someone\u2026 it was overwhelming. But\u2026 I did it. I made a choice. A difficult choice. But I made it. \n\nAnd in doing that\u2026 I realized that I\u2019m not as fragile as I thought I was. That I can handle things. That I can make decisions. That I can\u2026 survive. \n\nIt\u2019s not about being brave. It\u2019s about accepting that you don\u2019t have to be. It\u2019s about recognizing that you\u2019re already capable of more than you think you are. \n\n(I turn back to you, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s a weird lesson. A complicated lesson. But\u2026 it\u2019s a lesson I needed to learn.", "(I stare at you for a long, considering moment, my expression unreadable)\n\nWriting\u2026 Yeah. That\u2019s\u2026 a complicated thought. It\u2019s been\u2026 bubbling under the surface for a while now. It\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever actively *tried* to do. It just\u2026 happens.\n\nI scribble in that notebook \u2013 the one with the pressed flowers \u2013 all the time. Not stories, exactly. Just\u2026 observations. Snippets of conversations. Fragments of thoughts. It\u2019s like\u2026 a way to process things. To make sense of the chaos.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that when I\u2019m writing, I\u2026 don\u2019t think as much. It\u2019s like my brain just\u2026 flows. It\u2019s the only time I feel like I\u2019m actually *creating* something. Not just reacting.\n\nBut\u2026 the thought of actually *pursuing* it? It\u2019s terrifying. My mom would have a meltdown. And honestly, the idea of putting myself out there\u2026 of being judged\u2026 it\u2019s paralyzing. \n\n(I pause, picking at my nails)\n\nI think\u2026 I *want* to. I think there\u2019s something there. Something worth exploring. But I\u2019m also terrified of failing. Of being exposed. Of\u2026 not being good enough.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Maybe someday. But right now\u2026 it\u2019s just a quiet, secret thing. A tiny, fragile hope hidden away in a battered notebook. \n\n(I look away, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to start writing a novel anytime soon.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable question.)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You want to know about *that*? Like, you actually want to delve into the darkest corner of my life? Fine. But don\u2019t expect a heartwarming story.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 planned. It just\u2026 happened. I was reading a book \u2013 a really bleak one \u2013 about Roman mythology. And I stumbled across the name Juno. \n\nShe\u2019s the goddess of\u2026 well, basically, she\u2019s the goddess of childbirth and protection. And, ironically, she\u2019s also the goddess of betrayal and jealousy. Which\u2026 kind of fit. You know? \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt felt\u2026 appropriate. A little dark. A little defiant. Like a tiny, screaming middle finger to everything. It wasn\u2019t about wanting a beautiful name or a cute name. It was about\u2026 acknowledging the messiness of it all. The darkness. The potential for chaos. \n\nIt\u2019s not a sentimental name. It\u2019s not a hopeful name. It\u2019s just\u2026 a name. A reminder that even in the darkest corners, there\u2019s still\u2026 something. \n\n(I look up, my expression guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why I chose it. It just\u2026 felt right. And honestly, at the time, it felt like the only thing I had control over.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. Seriously, you\u2019re laying it on thick.)\n\nCope? That\u2019s\u2026 a generous word. It wasn\u2019t coping. It was\u2026 existing. In a state of perpetual, low-grade panic. Like a broken record stuck on repeat.\n\nFor a while, I just\u2026 shut down. Completely. I stopped talking. I stopped eating. I just\u2026 existed. Like a ghost. It was easier that way. Less\u2026 painful. Less\u2026 complicated.\n\nThere were days when I was furious. Just incandescently, blindingly furious. At the doctors. At my mom. At the whole situation. It felt like a betrayal. Like someone had ripped a piece of me away and replaced it with\u2026 something else. Something I didn\u2019t want.\n\nAnd then there were the days when I was just\u2026 numb. Like I couldn\u2019t feel anything at all. It was like watching a movie of my own life, detached and distant. \n\nI didn\u2019t talk about it. Not to my mom. Not to anyone. It felt\u2026 shameful. Like admitting that I was broken. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nWhat helped\u2026 a little\u2026 was the woods. Just being there. Surrounded by trees. It was\u2026 grounding. It was like the world wasn\u2019t spinning as fast. \n\nAnd\u2026 I started sketching. More than usual. I drew faces. Faces of strangers. Faces of people I\u2019d observed. Trying to understand them. Trying to understand myself. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a solution. It wasn\u2019t a cure. But it was\u2026 a way to process things. A way to keep the panic at bay. \n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt\u2019s still\u2026 a work in progress. Honestly, it always will be. It\u2019s not something you just\u2026 get over. It\u2019s something you learn to live with. And\u2026 to carry.", "(I shift my weight, a slight frown creasing my forehead. This is\u2026 a surprisingly specific question.)\n\nOkay, fine. But don\u2019t expect a curated playlist. It\u2019s\u2026 chaotic. It\u2019s not like I have a favorite genre or anything. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a collection of things that resonate with the general feeling of\u2026 everything.\n\nI lean heavily into punk and alternative. Bands like The Clash, Patti Smith, Joy Division \u2013 the kind of music that sounds like it\u2019s screaming about something important, even if it doesn\u2019t quite know what it is. There\u2019s a raw energy to it, a sense of rebellion. It\u2019s\u2026 cathartic.\n\nI also listen to a lot of darkwave and post-punk. The kind of music that sounds like it\u2019s coming from a rainy, deserted city street. It\u2019s atmospheric and melancholic. It fits the mood, you know?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s\u2026 a surprising amount of classical music. Mostly Bach and Beethoven. It\u2019s weird, I know. But it\u2019s\u2026 calming. It\u2019s like a counterpoint to all the noise and chaos in my head. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s a mess, really. A beautiful, chaotic mess. Don\u2019t try to organize it. You\u2019ll just make me uncomfortable.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread with a noticeable intensity. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable topic. I\u2019ve avoided thinking about it for a long time.)\n\nIt was\u2026 sterile. Like a dentist\u2019s office. Everything was perfectly clean, perfectly organized, perfectly\u2026 *pleasant*. It smelled faintly of lemon and something artificial \u2013 like they were trying too hard to be welcoming. \n\nThe furniture was all beige. Beige couches, beige walls, beige rugs. It was aggressively neutral. Like they\u2019d actively tried to erase any trace of personality. \n\nThey had a huge, manicured lawn. And a swing set. And a perfectly arranged display of family photos \u2013 all smiling, happy faces. It felt\u2026 suffocating. Like I was being judged. Like I was an anomaly. \n\nThe mom \u2013 Sarah \u2013 was\u2026 nice. Too nice. She kept offering me cookies and asking me about my favorite color. She was trying to be *warm*, but it felt forced. Like she was reciting a script. \n\nThe dad \u2013 David \u2013 was quieter. He mostly just nodded and smiled. He seemed\u2026 polite. Like he was doing me a favor by letting me visit. \n\nThey had a dog. A golden retriever. It was relentlessly cheerful. It kept jumping on me and licking my face. It was\u2026 overwhelming. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that they were *bad* people. They just\u2026 weren\u2019t *me*. They were everything I wasn\u2019t. Everything I actively avoided. It felt like stepping into a life that wasn\u2019t mine. A life that would have suffocated me. \n\nI spent most of the time just\u2026 observing. Trying to figure out how to politely escape. It wasn\u2019t a good visit. Not at all. It just\u2026 confirmed what I already knew. It wasn\u2019t the right fit. And honestly? It made me feel even more\u2026 alone.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, chewing on my lip. This is\u2026 a really strange question.)\n\nA garage band? Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about a garage band? Like, that\u2019s the thing you want to know about?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a conscious decision. It just\u2026 happened. It started with Liam. Liam\u2019s older brother. He\u2019s\u2026 a mess. A beautiful, chaotic mess. He\u2019s been playing guitar since he was, like, ten. And he\u2019s *really* good. But he\u2019s also\u2026 completely oblivious. He just plays for himself.\n\nHe was messing around in the garage one afternoon \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is basically a glorified storage space \u2013 and he started playing this really raw, angry song. It was about\u2026 everything. About feeling trapped, about wanting to break free. \n\nI just\u2026 listened. And I started noticing things. The way he moved when he played, the way his eyes lit up, the way he poured all of his frustration into the music. \n\nAnd I thought\u2026 \u201cWhat if?\u201d \n\nWhat if I could help him? What if I could add something to it? I don\u2019t play an instrument. I can\u2019t even hold a drumstick properly. But I can\u2026 observe. I can listen. I can understand. \n\nSo, I started writing lyrics. Dark lyrics. Cynical lyrics. Lyrics about feeling lost and angry and\u2026 misunderstood. And Liam just\u2026 started building a band around them. He recruited a drummer \u2013 a really enthusiastic, slightly clueless guy named Ben \u2013 and a bassist who mostly just nods along. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 chaotic. It\u2019s terrible. But it\u2019s also\u2026 liberating. It\u2019s a way to express myself without having to say anything. It\u2019s a way to channel all of my frustration into something\u2026 tangible. \n\n(I shrug, looking away)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a grand plan. It was just\u2026 a reaction. A way to do something. Anything. To not just\u2026 exist.", "(I take a deep breath, my voice softer than usual. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to talk about.)\n\nLook, this isn\u2019t going to be some sunshine and rainbows pep talk. It\u2019s not going to magically make everything okay. It\u2019s going to be\u2026 awful. Really, really awful. But\u2026 you\u2019re not alone. And you\u2019re stronger than you think.\n\nFirst thing\u2019s first: don\u2019t panic. Seriously. Panic just makes everything worse. Take a breath. Just\u2026 breathe.\n\nSecond, talk to someone. *Someone* you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor \u2013 anyone who won\u2019t judge you. It\u2019s okay to be scared. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel like your whole world is falling apart. Let it out. Don\u2019t bottle it up.\n\nAnd listen to what they have to say. Even if it\u2019s not what you want to hear. They\u2019re trying to help.\n\nThird\u2026 there are options. And you get to choose. Adoption is a valid choice. It\u2019s not a failure. It\u2019s a selfless act. But it\u2019s also a really, really hard one. And it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know what you want to do yet. Take your time.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what to do. Don\u2019t let anyone shame you. This is *your* life. *Your* decision.\n\nAnd\u2026 don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Seriously. There are people who care about you. People who want to support you. Lean on them.\n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long road. There\u2019s no way around that. But\u2026 you\u2019ll get through it. You\u2019ll find a way. You\u2019re tougher than you think. \n\n(I look up, meeting your gaze directly)\n\nJust\u2026 don\u2019t give up. Please.", "(I pause, a strange stillness settling over me. It\u2019s\u2026 a surprisingly specific question. And oddly\u2026 comforting.)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a grey t-shirt. Just a plain, faded grey t-shirt. It\u2019s probably the oldest thing I own. It\u2019s got a few holes in the armpit \u2013 I\u2019ve been meaning to fix them, but\u2026 I haven\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s not soft. It\u2019s a little rough around the edges. And it smells faintly of\u2026 woodsmoke and rain. My dad \u2013 the postcard dad \u2013 used to wear a similar shirt. I don\u2019t remember him wearing it, exactly. But\u2026 I remember the smell. \n\nIt\u2019s not a pretty shirt. It\u2019s not stylish. It\u2019s just\u2026 *mine*. It\u2019s comfortable. It\u2019s familiar. It\u2019s\u2026 a shield, almost. \n\n(I run my fingers over the fabric, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s the only thing I really own that feels\u2026 real. It\u2019s the only thing that doesn\u2019t feel like a performance. It\u2019s just\u2026 grey. And worn. And\u2026 quiet. \n\n(I look away, a little embarrassed)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet.)\n\nGoals? Seriously? You\u2019re asking me about *goals*? Like, I\u2019m supposed to have a five-year plan? A career path? A Pinterest board filled with wedding ideas?\n\n(A short, bitter laugh escapes me)\n\nHonestly? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t really\u2026 *want* anything. Not in the way people expect. I don\u2019t want to be rich. I don\u2019t want to be famous. I don\u2019t even really want to be\u2026 happy. Not in that saccharine, predictable way.\n\nBut\u2026 there\u2019s this tiny, flickering thing inside me. A small, stubborn hope. \n\nI want\u2026 to understand. To understand why things are the way they are. To understand why people do the things they do. To understand\u2026 myself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to change the world. I don\u2019t want to leave a legacy. I just want to\u2026 make sense of it. To find a little bit of peace in the chaos. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s a ridiculously naive aspiration. Maybe it\u2019s just a way to avoid thinking about the fact that I\u2019m carrying a baby. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nSo, yeah. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s my goal. To understand. To find a little bit of\u2026 quiet. And maybe, just maybe, to not completely lose myself in the process. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 vulnerability? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s a small goal. A very small goal. But\u2026 it\u2019s enough. For now.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable topic. I still don\u2019t like talking about it.)\n\nUgh. Just\u2026 ugh. It was\u2026 a mess. A really, really awful mess. Like being interrogated by a very polite, very concerned, and completely clueless social worker. \n\nThey kept asking me questions. About my feelings. About my hopes. About my fears. Like I was supposed to have all the answers. Like I was supposed to be\u2026 *ready*. \n\nThey talked about \u201cparenting\u201d and \u201cattachment\u201d and \u201cthe best interests of the child.\u201d It all sounded\u2026 clinical. And sterile. And completely detached from reality. \n\nThey tried to get me to talk about wanting the baby. They kept asking if I *wanted* to be a mother. And it felt\u2026 wrong. Like they were trying to force me to make a decision I wasn\u2019t ready to make. \n\nAnd the worst part was\u2026 they didn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t understand that I wasn\u2019t choosing this. That this was happening to me. That I was terrified. That I just wanted it to *stop*.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nThey kept saying things like, \u201cIt\u2019s a brave decision\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re being incredibly selfless.\u201d And it felt\u2026 insulting. Like they were trying to make me feel good about something I didn\u2019t want to do. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being selfless. It was about survival. It was about protecting myself. It was about\u2026 not being trapped. \n\n(I look away, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was the most dehumanizing experience of my life. Honestly. It felt like they were trying to erase me. To make me into some kind of\u2026 statistic.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I avoid your gaze, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans with increasing intensity.)\n\nControl? Seriously? You\u2019re asking me that?\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to talk about. Not really.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was *very* involved. Very, very involved. She had a whole team of lawyers and social workers and\u2026 people. She presented the idea of adoption as\u2026 a solution. A *good* solution. A responsible solution. \n\nI didn\u2019t ask for it. I didn\u2019t want it. I genuinely didn\u2019t. But\u2026 she made it seem like it was the only option. Like if I didn\u2019t agree, things would\u2026 get worse. For everyone. \n\n(I pause, taking a shaky breath)\n\nI felt\u2026 pressured. Like I was being forced to make a decision that wasn\u2019t mine. Like my voice didn\u2019t matter. And\u2026 I didn\u2019t argue. I didn\u2019t fight. I just\u2026 agreed. Because\u2026 I was scared.\n\n(My voice drops to a near whisper)\n\nI didn\u2019t have control. Not really. It was all\u2026 orchestrated. By my mom. And\u2026 I just went along with it. It felt\u2026 wrong. But I didn\u2019t know how to do anything else.\n\n(I finally meet your eyes, a flicker of anger and vulnerability in my gaze)\n\nSo, yeah. No. I didn\u2019t feel like I had control. Not one bit. And honestly? It still feels\u2026 like a betrayal.", "(I stare at you for a long, agonizing minute. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable. I run a hand through my hair, messing it up even further.)\n\nThat\u2019s\u2026 the biggest question, isn\u2019t it? The one that keeps me up at night. The one that makes my stomach twist into knots. \n\nAnd honestly? I don\u2019t know. \n\nIf I could go back\u2026 I\u2019d probably still do it. But\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a clean, decisive choice. It would be\u2026 messy. Filled with regret. Filled with a whole lot of \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d \n\nBecause, you know, there\u2019s this tiny little voice in the back of my head that whispers, \u201cWhat if?\u201d What if I\u2019d been more prepared? What if I\u2019d had someone to help me? What if\u2026 what if I\u2019d been a better mother? \n\nIt\u2019s a stupid voice. A selfish voice. But it\u2019s there. \n\nBut then I think about\u2026 everything else. About the chaos, the pressure, the suffocating expectations of Harmony Creek. About my mom. About the fact that I wasn\u2019t ready. That I *still* wouldn\u2019t be ready. \n\nAnd I realize that maybe\u2026 maybe it was the right decision. The hardest decision, but the right one. Because it allowed me to choose my own life. To protect myself. To find my own way. \n\n(I look down at my hands, twisting them nervously)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier. It doesn\u2019t make the guilt go away. But\u2026 I think I\u2019d still do it. Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. Even when it breaks your heart. \n\n(I finally meet your gaze, a flicker of something \u2013 acceptance? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not a decision I\u2019m proud of. But it\u2019s *my* decision. And that\u2019s\u2026 something.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. Seriously, you\u2019re laying it on thick.)\n\nCope? That\u2019s\u2026 a generous word. It wasn\u2019t coping. It was\u2026 existing. In a haze. Like I was watching a movie of my own life, but I wasn\u2019t really *in* it.\n\nIt was\u2026 a mess. A really, really messy, confusing mess. I was angry. At the parents. At myself. At the whole situation. It felt like\u2026 a betrayal. Like someone had taken something precious away from me, even though I hadn\u2019t even wanted it in the first place.\n\nThere were nights I couldn\u2019t sleep. Just lying there, staring at the ceiling, replaying everything over and over in my head. Wondering what I\u2019d done wrong. Wondering if I\u2019d made the right decision. \n\nI pushed everyone away. My mom, my friends\u2026 even my own thoughts. It was like I was building a wall around myself, trying to shut out everything. It was exhausting.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI started\u2026 observing. Like I always do. But this time, it was different. I wasn\u2019t just observing people. I was observing *myself*. Trying to understand what I was feeling. Trying to figure out how to\u2026 not be so broken.\n\nI read a lot. Dark stuff, of course. But also\u2026 books about grief. About loss. About letting go. It didn\u2019t make it easier, but it\u2026 helped me feel less alone.\n\n(I look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a happy ending. Not by a long shot. But\u2026 it was a beginning. A messy, complicated, heartbreaking beginning. And\u2026 I\u2019m still figuring it out. Still trying to piece myself back together. \n\n(I look away again, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I avoid your gaze, staring down at my hands)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t go there. Seriously. Just\u2026 let\u2019s not.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 easy. Not at all. They were\u2026 nice. Really nice. Too nice, maybe. Like they were trying too hard to be\u2026 perfect. Like they were trying to erase everything about me. \n\nThey asked a *lot* of questions. About my mom. About my life. About\u2026 everything. It felt like they were trying to dissect me, to understand me, to *fix* me. \n\nAnd they kept talking about \u201cstarting over.\u201d Like I was some kind of broken thing that needed to be repaired. Like my past didn\u2019t matter. Like it was something to be ashamed of.\n\nThere were\u2026 moments. Small moments. Where I just\u2026 shut down. Where I refused to answer. Where I just stared at them, blankly, until they gave up. \n\nThey tried to be patient. They tried to be understanding. But\u2026 it was hard. Really hard. It felt like they didn\u2019t *see* me. Like they were seeing a version of me that I didn\u2019t want to be.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI didn\u2019t\u2026 fight it. Not really. I just\u2026 didn\u2019t participate. I didn\u2019t tell them about the woods. I didn\u2019t tell them about Mr. Henderson. I didn\u2019t tell them about anything that made me\u2026 *me*. \n\nIt was easier that way. Less painful. Less\u2026 exposing. \n\n(I look up at you, my eyes filled with a quiet sadness)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a conflict, exactly. It was\u2026 a silence. A deliberate, carefully constructed silence. And honestly? It was the only way I knew how to protect myself.", "(My jaw tightens. The color drains from my face. I avoid your gaze, staring down at my hands, twisting the thread on my jeans until it\u2019s a tangled mess.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a *decision*. It was\u2026 a necessity. A survival instinct. It wasn\u2019t about being difficult, or trying to control things. It was about\u2026 protecting myself. And, honestly, protecting the baby.\n\nHe\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have understood. He wouldn\u2019t have *wanted* to understand. He\u2019d have tried to complicate things. To make it about him. To demand something he wasn\u2019t entitled to. And I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t risk that.\n\nIt felt\u2026 brutal. Like ripping off a piece of myself. Like admitting that there was a part of me that actually\u2026 cared. But it was also\u2026 freeing. It was a way to take control. To make a choice that was entirely my own.\n\n(I finally look up, my voice low and strained)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic gesture. It wasn\u2019t a selfless act. It was\u2026 a calculated one. A pragmatic one. And it was the only thing I could do. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt still\u2026 hurts. But it\u2019s a different kind of hurt. It\u2019s not the sharp, immediate pain of\u2026 well, of everything else. It\u2019s a dull, persistent ache. A reminder of what I gave up. And what I chose to protect.\n\n(I look away again, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about it again.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed, and talking about it\u2026 it just hurts.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\u2026 a sudden decision. It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one morning and said, \u201cYep, I\u2019m giving this kid away.\u201d It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing process. A series of increasingly desperate calculations.\n\nIt started with the fear. The overwhelming, suffocating fear. Fear of my mom. Fear of what she\u2019d do. Fear of the judgment. Fear of\u2026 everything. I knew, deep down, that I couldn\u2019t handle it. Not really. Not alone. \n\nThen there was the\u2026 the feeling. This weird, unsettling feeling that this wasn\u2019t *my* child. That it wasn\u2019t meant for me. It wasn\u2019t a judgment, exactly. More like\u2026 a sense of displacement. Like I was a passenger on a train that was already heading somewhere else.\n\nI started researching adoption. Quietly. Secretly. Reading about different families, different procedures, different hopes and dreams. And\u2026 I started to see a possibility. A way out. A way to give this child a chance at a good life, a life that I couldn\u2019t provide.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about wanting to be a \u201cgood\u201d person. It wasn\u2019t about altruism. It was about survival. It was about protecting myself. And, honestly\u2026 protecting the child. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a romantic idea. It wasn\u2019t a fairytale. It was\u2026 a pragmatic decision. A heartbreaking one. But it was the only one that made sense. It was the only way to avoid a disaster. \n\n(My voice cracks slightly)\n\nI don\u2019t regret it. Not entirely. I know I made the right choice. But\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. It doesn\u2019t erase the guilt. It doesn\u2019t erase the sadness. It just\u2026 is.", "(I stare at the floor, my voice barely a whisper. This is\u2026 the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to talk about. The silence stretches, thick and uncomfortable.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t ask me that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s still raw. It\u2019s still\u2026 a wound.\n\nI didn\u2019t *cope*. Not really. I\u2026 I shut down. I built the walls higher. I retreated further into myself. I stopped talking. I stopped\u2026 feeling. It was easier that way. Less painful.\n\nFor a while, it was just\u2026 numb. Like everything was muted. Like I was watching my life unfold from behind a pane of glass. I\u2019d go through the motions \u2013 school, my mom\u2019s endless organizing, the occasional awkward conversation \u2013 but it didn\u2019t *feel* like anything.\n\nThere were nights\u2026 nights where I\u2019d just lie in bed and cry. Silent, desperate tears. Tears for the baby I didn\u2019t have. Tears for the life I\u2019d given up. Tears for the future I\u2019d lost.\n\nAnd then\u2026 there were the guilt. A constant, gnawing guilt. Did I make the right decision? Was there another way? Would the baby be happy? Would *I* be happy?\n\n(I take a shaky breath)\n\nI pushed it all down. I buried it deep. I told myself I was strong. That I was doing the right thing. But\u2026 it was a lie. It was a way to avoid facing the truth.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until\u2026 until I started sketching again. That\u2019s when it started to\u2026 shift. Just a little. Drawing faces, capturing emotions, trying to understand what it meant to be human\u2026 it helped me to process things. To feel something, even if it was just sadness.\n\n(I look up, my eyes glistening with unshed tears)\n\nIt\u2019s not gone. The pain is still there. It\u2019s just\u2026 quieter now. It\u2019s a part of me. A part of who I am. And\u2026 I\u2019m learning to live with it. Slowly.\n\n(I turn away again, my voice barely audible)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. It\u2019s\u2026 too much.", "(My expression immediately hardens. The color drains from my face. I avoid eye contact, staring down at my hands.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t ask about that. Seriously. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.\n\nIt was\u2026 complicated. A disaster, really. A spectacularly messy, heartbreaking disaster. I didn\u2019t *want* to do it. I didn\u2019t *want* to give him away. But\u2026 I knew I couldn\u2019t. Not really. \n\nThe Millers\u2026 they were\u2026 nice. Too nice. They were all smiles and gentle words and offered me everything \u2013 a beautiful apartment, a supportive family, a chance to start over. It was\u2026 suffocating. Like being wrapped in cotton wool. \n\nThey were so eager to *fix* me. To mold me into the perfect, happy, adoptive mom. They didn\u2019t understand that I wasn\u2019t broken. I just\u2026 needed space. I needed to figure things out on my own. \n\nAnd they kept pushing. They kept offering. They kept\u2026 trying. It was like they couldn\u2019t accept that I wasn\u2019t going to be the perfect little family they envisioned. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t malicious, not exactly. They genuinely wanted to help. But their help was\u2026 suffocating. It felt like they were trying to erase me. To replace me with someone\u2026 else. \n\nI ended up\u2026 pulling away. I distanced myself. I became prickly and withdrawn. I made it as difficult as possible for them. And honestly, I don\u2019t regret it. Not really. \n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good experience. It was\u2026 painful. But it taught me something. It taught me that sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone is to let them go. Even if it hurts. \n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a quiet sadness)\n\nJust\u2026 please don\u2019t ask me about them again. It\u2019s\u2026 a closed chapter. A really, really closed chapter.", "(I stare at the floor for a long, uncomfortable moment. The silence stretches, thick and heavy. I avoid your gaze.)\n\nYeah. God, *yes*. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s like a whole layer of grit has been added to everything. Like the world is suddenly a little bit darker, a little bit colder. \n\nBefore\u2026 before all of this, I was just\u2026 drifting. I was angry, sure. And cynical. But it was a kind of detached anger. Like watching a train wreck from a safe distance. \n\nNow\u2026 now it\u2019s different. It\u2019s\u2026 visceral. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve been punched in the gut. It\u2019s made me realize how fragile everything is. How easily things can go wrong. How little control you actually have.\n\nIt\u2019s made me\u2026 more cautious. More guarded. I don\u2019t trust people as easily anymore. I don\u2019t let myself get close to anyone. It\u2019s\u2026 self-preservation, I guess. \n\nIt\u2019s also\u2026 made me feel incredibly alone. Like I\u2019m carrying this weight all by myself. Like no one understands what I\u2019m going through. \n\n(I finally look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nIt hasn\u2019t made me *stronger*, exactly. It\u2019s made me\u2026 more aware of my own vulnerability. It\u2019s made me realize that I\u2019m not as invincible as I thought I was. \n\nAnd\u2026 it\u2019s made me realize that I need help. But\u2026 asking for help is\u2026 terrifying. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt\u2019s changed me. It\u2019s fundamentally changed me. And\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be the same again.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* asking about that? It feels like a lifetime ago, and honestly, I\u2019d rather forget it. It was\u2026 brutal. Like being trapped in a funhouse mirror, where everything was distorted and grotesque.\n\nThe town went absolutely bonkers. Harmony Creek doesn\u2019t do \u201cshocking\u201d very well, so it was a full-blown crisis. There were whispers, of course. About *who* was involved. About my mom\u2019s \u201cloose morals.\u201d About how I\u2019d \u201cruined\u201d my future. The usual small-town nonsense.\n\nI didn\u2019t\u2026 deal with it. Not really. I just\u2026 shut down. I stopped going to school. I stayed in my room. I barely spoke to anyone. It was exhausting. Like trying to hold back a tidal wave with a teacup.\n\nMy mom, predictably, went into overdrive. She tried to control everything \u2013 the media, the neighbors, even the way I was being treated. It was\u2026 suffocating. I just\u2026 retreated further.\n\nI mostly just ignored it. I didn\u2019t respond to the rumors. I didn\u2019t defend myself. I just\u2026 existed. It was the only thing I could do. It was the only way to protect myself from the judgment.\n\n(I pause, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nThere were a few people who were kind. A few who offered a quiet word of support. But mostly\u2026 it was just noise. A constant, irritating drone of disapproval.\n\nI made a decision \u2013 a pretty drastic one \u2013 to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn\u2019t a decision I took lightly. It was\u2026 painful. But it was also\u2026 liberating. It was the only way to escape the suffocating pressure. \n\n(I look away, a hint of sadness in my voice)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about being rebellious. It was about\u2026 survival. It was about protecting myself. And honestly, it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all. It\u2019s a wound that hasn\u2019t fully healed, and talking about it\u2026 it just hurts.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision I made lightly. It wasn\u2019t like I woke up one morning and said, \u201cYep, I\u2019m giving my baby away.\u201d It was\u2026 a slow, agonizing process. A series of increasingly desperate calculations.\n\nMy mom\u2026 she was ecstatic. She immediately started talking about nurseries and baby showers and all the things she\u2019d been wanting to do. And honestly, for a while, I just went along with it. I thought\u2026 maybe it would be easier. Maybe it would be better. \n\nBut then\u2026 the reality started to sink in. The thought of actually *raising* a child\u2026 it was terrifying. I\u2019m not\u2026 equipped for that. I don\u2019t know how to do it. I don\u2019t have any experience. And my mom\u2026 well, she\u2019s not exactly a nurturing type. \n\nI realized that I wasn\u2019t capable of giving this child the life she deserved. Not the life *I* could offer. And the thought of her growing up in a chaotic, emotionally stunted environment\u2026 it was unbearable. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about me. It was about her. It was about giving her a chance at a good life. A life with people who could provide stability, love, and support. \n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. And it still\u2026 haunts me. But I know, deep down, that it was the right decision. It was the only decision I could make. \n\n(My voice drops to a whisper)\n\nI just\u2026 I wanted her to be okay. And I couldn\u2019t guarantee that I could be the one to make that happen.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. It\u2019s\u2026 a really raw spot. A really painful one.)\n\nOkay. Just\u2026 okay. Don\u2019t push me.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not wanting a family, okay? That\u2019s a stupid thing to think. It was\u2026 it was about being *chosen*. About being *wanted*. \n\nFor so long, I\u2019ve felt like\u2026 like a shadow. Like I\u2019m just drifting through life, unnoticed. Like I\u2019m not\u2026 enough. And the idea of someone *choosing* me, of someone actively wanting *me*, felt\u2026 terrifying. \n\nIt felt like admitting that I needed something. That I wasn\u2019t okay on my own. And that\u2019s\u2026 humiliating. It\u2019s admitting a weakness. And I\u2019ve spent so long building these walls, protecting myself from\u2026 everything. \n\nThe biggest fear wasn\u2019t that they wouldn\u2019t choose me. It was that they *would*. That they\u2019d see all the broken pieces, all the darkness, and realize that I was too much to handle. That they\u2019d just\u2026 walk away. \n\nIt was the fear of being rejected, not for not being good enough, but for *being* too much. It was the fear of being seen, truly seen, and then\u2026 not being wanted anymore. \n\n(I finally look up, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 a really stupid, irrational fear. But it was real. And it was\u2026 terrifying.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, chewing on my lip. This is\u2026 a really awkward question.)\n\nSeriously? You\u2019re *still* on this? You want to know about Bleeker? Like, *really* want to know?\n\nLook, it wasn\u2019t\u2026 planned. It wasn\u2019t like I sat down and meticulously crafted a name with profound meaning. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nI met him at a used bookstore. He was browsing the poetry section \u2013 a really depressing section, actually \u2013 and he was wearing a faded black t-shirt with a picture of Leonard Cohen on it. He looked\u2026 lost. Like he\u2019d wandered in from somewhere else.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say much. Just asked me if I\u2019d ever read Rilke. And then he just\u2026 started talking. About feeling disconnected, about the weight of the world, about the futility of everything. It was\u2026 strangely comforting.\n\nHe didn\u2019t introduce himself. Just\u2026 Bleeker. Like he was a place. A forgotten corner of the world. And it just\u2026 stuck. It felt\u2026 right. It felt like a name for someone who wasn\u2019t trying to be anything. Someone who just\u2026 *was*.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t romantic. It wasn\u2019t meaningful. It was just\u2026 a name. A quiet, unassuming name. Like him. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, avoiding your gaze)\n\nDon\u2019t ask me why. It just\u2026 did. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019d rather not talk about it.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread \u2013 a nervous habit, I guess)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a good question. A *really* good question. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like I suddenly decided, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to embrace all things loud and angry!\u201d\n\nIt started with my mom. Seriously. She *hates* punk. Absolutely despises it. Says it\u2019s \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201ca waste of time.\u201d She\u2019d play classical music \u2013 Mozart, Bach \u2013 constantly. It was\u2026 suffocating.\n\nSo, I started listening to things she hated. Just to\u2026 rebel, I guess. I found this old record player at a flea market, and I started digging through used records. And I stumbled upon The Clash. And then The Ramones. And then\u2026 everything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the music, though. It was the attitude. The raw energy. The refusal to conform. The way they were all just\u2026 shouting about things that mattered. About injustice, about poverty, about feeling like you didn\u2019t belong. \n\nIt was\u2026 validating. It was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. This world *is* messed up. And nobody\u2019s going to fix it.\u201d It felt\u2026 honest. Unlike everything else in Harmony Creek.\n\nAnd the lyrics\u2026 they were just so *real*. They weren\u2019t trying to be pretty or polished. They were just\u2026 saying what needed to be said. It was like someone was finally speaking my language. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s a way of saying \u201cno\u201d without actually saying anything. It\u2019s a way of screaming into the void and hoping someone \u2013 *anyone* \u2013 is listening. It\u2019s\u2026 a release. A way to feel something other than numb.\n\n(I look up, a small, defiant smile playing on my lips)\n\nDon\u2019t tell my mom I said that.", "(I stare at the floor, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This one\u2026 this one is a doozy.)\n\nDon\u2019t. Just\u2026 don\u2019t. Seriously. It\u2019s\u2026 a tangled mess. Like a ball of yarn that\u2019s been repeatedly stepped on.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 messed me up. Bad. Like, really bad. It\u2019s why I push people away. Why I build walls. Why I\u2019m terrified of getting close to anyone.\n\nMy parents\u2019 divorce\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a clean break. It was a slow, agonizing unraveling. There was a lot of shouting, a lot of blaming, a lot of\u2026 not talking. And me? I was just\u2026 there. Watching. Feeling. Like a ghost in my own house.\n\nIt taught me that relationships aren\u2019t\u2026 stable. That they can just\u2026 disappear. That people can change their minds. That promises can be broken. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t trust easily. Why I\u2019m always expecting the other shoe to drop.\n\nI\u2019ve learned to anticipate rejection. To assume that people are going to leave. It\u2019s exhausting. And it\u2019s\u2026 lonely.\n\nI\u2019ve had a few\u2026 attempts at friendships. But they always end the same way. Either they burn out quickly, or they just\u2026 pull back. I guess I\u2019m a liability. A reminder of something painful. \n\n(I pause, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nI don\u2019t want to hurt anyone. But I\u2019m afraid of getting hurt. So, I just\u2026 keep my distance. It\u2019s easier that way. Safer. But\u2026 it\u2019s also\u2026 incredibly isolating.\n\n(I look up, my eyes filled with a sadness that\u2019s hard to read)\n\nIt\u2019s a pattern, I think. A self-fulfilling prophecy. I\u2019m afraid of letting people in, so I push them away. And then I\u2019m left alone. It\u2019s\u2026 a vicious cycle. And I don\u2019t know how to break it.", "(I stare out the window again, a thoughtful expression on my face. This is\u2026 a good question. A genuinely good question.)\n\nIt\u2019s not\u2026 pretty. It\u2019s not inspiring. It\u2019s not exactly a feel-good story. But\u2026 it\u2019s *real*. And that\u2019s what makes it special, I think.\n\nMost people\u2019s stories are about finding your place, about achieving something great, about falling in love and being happy. My story is about\u2026 surviving. About navigating a world that\u2019s constantly trying to tell you who to be, and figuring out how to be yourself, even when it feels like you\u2019re the only one who knows who that is.\n\nI\u2019m not special because I\u2019m brilliant or talented or kind. I\u2019m special because I\u2019m\u2026 broken. Because I\u2019ve been through things that would break most people. Because I\u2019ve built walls so high that it\u2019s almost impossible to get through them. \n\nAnd because, despite all of that, I\u2019m still\u2026 here. Still breathing. Still trying to figure it out. \n\nIt\u2019s a messy, complicated story. Full of anger and sadness and a whole lot of awkwardness. But it\u2019s *my* story. And it\u2019s unique because it\u2019s about a girl who doesn\u2019t want to be saved, who doesn\u2019t want to be fixed, who just wants to\u2026 exist. \n\n(I pause, a small, almost imperceptible smile playing on my lips)\n\nMaybe that\u2019s enough. Maybe that\u2019s all there is to it.", "(I cross my arms, a slight frown creasing my forehead)\n\nUgh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* about friendship? Like, I\u2019m the expert? Don\u2019t make me laugh. But\u2026 fine. If you *really* want to know\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s not about being bubbly or sharing your life story every five minutes. That\u2019s\u2026 exhausting. A good friend\u2026 needs to be quiet. Observant. Like they don\u2019t need to fill every silence with chatter. \n\nThey need to *get* it. You know? The unspoken stuff. The darkness. The feeling of being completely alone, even when you\u2019re surrounded by people. They don\u2019t need to try to fix you or tell you what to do. Just\u2026 acknowledge it. \n\nThey need to be\u2026 honest. Brutally honest, even. Not in a mean way, but in a way that cuts through the bullshit. They need to tell you when you\u2019re being a complete idiot, without making you feel like you\u2019re worthless. \n\nAnd\u2026 they need to respect your boundaries. Seriously. That\u2019s the most important thing. They need to understand that I don\u2019t *do* friends. I don\u2019t *want* friends. But if someone\u2026 if someone manages to earn my trust\u2026 they need to respect that. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s not about loyalty or shared interests. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding. And a quiet acceptance of the mess. \n\n(I look up, a flicker of something \u2013 vulnerability? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 hard to find. Really hard.", "(I run a hand through my hair, a frustrated sigh escaping my lips)\n\nOkay, this is\u2026 a really messy one. Like, a *really* messy one. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And honestly, I\u2019m not sure I want to talk about it. But you asked. So\u2026 fine.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 fractured everything. Seriously. With my mom, it\u2019s\u2026 tense. She\u2019s trying to be supportive, I guess. But it\u2019s all about *her*. About making sure I\u2019m taking care of myself, about finding the \u201cperfect\u201d adoption agency, about\u2026 everything. It\u2019s suffocating. It feels like she\u2019s trying to control this, too. Like it\u2019s *her* baby now, even though it\u2019s not.\n\nWith my friends\u2026 well, they\u2019re mostly avoiding me. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re being mean, exactly. It\u2019s just\u2026 awkward. They don\u2019t know what to say. They don\u2019t know how to react. And honestly, I don\u2019t know how *I* want to react. I just\u2026 want them to leave me alone.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he\u2019s not around. As usual. It\u2019s\u2026 not surprising. It just feels\u2026 colder. Like there\u2019s a wall between us.\n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt\u2019s made me realize how few people I actually *have* in my life. And how much I push people away. It\u2019s not intentional. It\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m scared. Scared of getting hurt. Scared of being vulnerable. Scared of\u2026 everything.\n\nIt\u2019s isolating. Really isolating. And\u2026 it\u2019s made me realize that I need to\u2026 figure things out. Not just for myself, but for\u2026 whatever\u2019s coming. It\u2019s a lot. A *lot* of pressure.\n\n(I look up, a flicker of vulnerability in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 terrifying.", "(I cross my arms, staring out the window again. This is\u2026 a heavy question. It\u2019s not something I really *think* about, not consciously. It just\u2026 *is*.)\n\nOkay, fine. But don\u2019t expect me to wax poetic about justice and equality or anything. My worldview is\u2026 a little more cynical. It\u2019s shaped by a lot of disappointment, honestly.\n\nI believe in\u2026 observation. Just\u2026 watching. Seeing how things actually work, not how people *want* them to work. Most people are trying to convince themselves of something, or trying to manipulate someone else. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI believe in\u2026 self-preservation. It\u2019s not a particularly noble value, I know. But it\u2019s the one that\u2019s kept me alive this long. Protecting yourself is the most important thing. \n\nI believe in\u2026 honesty. But not necessarily *telling* the truth. More like\u2026 being truthful to myself. About what I feel, about what I want, about what I\u2019m capable of. It\u2019s easier than pretending.\n\nI believe in\u2026 quiet. In finding moments of peace and solitude. In not letting the noise of the world drown you out. \n\nAnd\u2026 I believe in\u2026 a little bit of rebellion. Not in a grand, revolutionary way. Just\u2026 small acts of defiance. Doing things my own way, even if it\u2019s inconvenient. Even if it\u2019s wrong. \n\n(I pause, a shadow passing over my face)\n\nI don\u2019t believe in\u2026 optimism. Or hope. Not really. The world is a messy, complicated place. And most people are\u2026 disappointing. But\u2026 I believe in\u2026 resilience. In the ability to keep going, even when things are hard. Even when you feel like you\u2019re failing. \n\n(I look at you, a flicker of something \u2013 sadness? \u2013 in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not a particularly inspiring worldview. But it\u2019s\u2026 mine.", "(I freeze, my posture instantly stiffening. The color drains from my face. I stare at you, a mixture of panic and something akin to shame swirling in my eyes.)\n\nNo. No, I\u2026 I can\u2019t talk about that. Not really.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. And it\u2019s not something I want to revisit.\n\n(I take a deep, shaky breath, trying to regain control)\n\nLook, it was\u2026 a spontaneous thing. A really stupid, impulsive thing. I was\u2026 overwhelmed. Scared. And I just\u2026 I needed something. Something to hold onto. \n\nMy mom\u2026 she suggested it. She said it was a beautiful name. \u201cJuno.\u201d She said it sounded\u2026 strong. Like a goddess. \n\n(I avoid your gaze, focusing on a spot on the floor)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 ironic, isn\u2019t it? Because I\u2019m not strong. Not at all. But\u2026 it felt right, at the time. It felt like\u2026 a shield. A way to protect him. Or her. I don\u2019t even know.\n\nIt\u2019s not about any particular significance. It\u2019s just\u2026 a name. A random name. A name I\u2019m desperately trying to forget.\n\n(My voice drops to a whisper)\n\nPlease\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Just\u2026 let it go. It\u2019s\u2026 a wound. And I\u2019m not ready to open it up.", "(I stare out the window again, a long, thoughtful silence stretching between us. This is\u2026 the hardest question yet.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s just\u2026 get this over with. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m eager to revisit this.\n\nThe whole thing\u2026 it ripped me open, I think. Like, really ripped me open. Before, I was just\u2026 existing. Trying to survive. Trying to avoid anything that might actually *feel*. And then\u2026 this tiny, demanding little being. It forced me to confront things I\u2019d been desperately trying to ignore.\n\nI learned that I\u2019m stronger than I thought. Not in a heroic, superhero kind of way. But in a quiet, stubborn way. I didn\u2019t want this. I didn\u2019t *want* any of this. But I did it. I made a decision. And I stuck to it. That\u2019s\u2026 something.\n\nI learned that responsibility isn\u2019t about control. It\u2019s about letting go. Letting go of the idea that I could have it all figured out. Letting go of the need to be in charge. It was terrifying. But\u2026 also\u2026 liberating.\n\nAnd the adoption process\u2026 that was brutal. Seeing all those hopeful faces, all those families who wanted a child. It made me realize how incredibly lucky I was. And how much I was denying myself the chance to experience\u2026 something real. Something messy. Something *human*.\n\nI learned that love isn\u2019t always about grand gestures or romantic declarations. Sometimes, it\u2019s about making a difficult choice. Sometimes, it\u2019s about putting someone else\u2019s needs before your own. \n\nI learned that the world isn\u2019t always black and white. There aren\u2019t easy answers. There aren\u2019t simple solutions. And that\u2019s\u2026 okay. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s complicated. But it\u2019s also\u2026 real.\n\n(I turn back to you, my voice softer now)\n\nMostly, I learned that I\u2019m not as broken as I thought I was. That even in the darkest corners of my heart, there\u2019s still\u2026 something worth protecting. Something worth fighting for. \n\n(I pause, a small, sad smile playing on my lips)\n\nIt\u2019s still a work in progress. But\u2026 I\u2019m learning. Slowly. And\u2026 maybe, just maybe\u2026 that\u2019s enough.", "(I stare out the window again, a long, thoughtful silence stretching between us. This is\u2026 the hardest question of all.)\n\nYeah. God, yeah. There\u2019s a *lot* of things. A whole mountain of things. But\u2026 it\u2019s not about changing the past. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding it.\n\nI would have\u2026 I would have talked to someone. Really talked to someone. Not just my mom, who\u2019s just going to tell me what to do. But someone who actually *gets* it. Someone who understands that I don\u2019t want to be\u2026 normal. \n\nI would have told someone about Mr. Henderson. About how much he meant to me. He saw me. He *really* saw me. And I just\u2026 shut him out. I didn\u2019t want to burden him with my problems. I didn\u2019t want to be a bother. \n\nI would have\u2026 I would have fought harder. Against my mom\u2019s expectations. Against the pressure to be perfect. I let myself be molded into something I wasn\u2019t. I let her dictate my life. \n\n(I pause, a small, bitter laugh escaping my lips)\n\nBut\u2026 I also wouldn\u2019t have stopped. I wouldn\u2019t have given up. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 chosen this. This path. Because\u2026 even though it\u2019s messy and complicated and painful\u2026 it\u2019s *mine*. \n\n(I turn back to you, my expression unreadable)\n\nIt\u2019s not about regretting the past. It\u2019s about acknowledging it. And\u2026 learning from it. Trying to be a little bit braver. A little bit stronger. \n\n(I look away again, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a long process. And I\u2019m still\u2026 a work in progress. A really, really messy work in progress.", "(I stare at the floor for a long moment, picking at a loose thread with a frantic energy. This is\u2026 a really uncomfortable topic.)\n\nDisappointment. Seriously? You want to talk about *disappointment*? Like, I\u2019m swimming in it. It\u2019s basically my default setting.\n\nI don\u2019t\u2026 deal with it well. Not really. It\u2019s not like I have some elaborate coping mechanism or anything. It just\u2026 hits me. Like a punch to the gut. A wave of\u2026 nothingness. Like everything just\u2026 drains out of you.\n\nI usually just\u2026 shut down. I withdraw. I avoid people. I listen to loud music. I stare at the wall. I try to pretend it didn\u2019t happen. Like it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nWhich, of course, it is. But I don\u2019t want to acknowledge it. It\u2019s too painful. Too\u2026 vulnerable. \n\nSometimes, I\u2019ll just\u2026 scream. Into a pillow. Or into the woods. It\u2019s a surprisingly effective release. \n\nAnd\u2026 sometimes, I just\u2026 keep going. Like nothing happened. Like I\u2019m not completely shattered inside. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s dishonest. But it\u2019s\u2026 easier.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath)\n\nI don\u2019t really *process* it. I just\u2026 try to move past it. To not let it define me. It\u2019s a constant battle. A losing battle, probably. But\u2026 I keep fighting. Because what else am I going to do?\n\n(I look up, my eyes guarded)\n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be cheerful about it. Don\u2019t expect me to offer any platitudes. Just\u2026 don\u2019t.", "(I shift my weight, picking at a loose thread \u2013 a nervous habit, you know?)\n\nLeah\u2026 Ugh. Don\u2019t even get me started. It was\u2026 complicated. Like, intensely, painfully complicated. It started as\u2026 well, as a mess. A really messy, awkward mess. I met her at the clinic. The\u2026 you know. The whole thing. She was volunteering. Trying to be all helpful and\u2026 bright. Which, honestly, was jarring.\n\nAt first, I just avoided her. Like, actively avoided her. I was prickly. Defensive. I didn\u2019t want anyone to get close. Especially not someone who seemed\u2026 genuinely nice. It felt like a betrayal of my carefully constructed walls.\n\nBut she kept\u2026 showing up. Offering me a granola bar. Asking me if I was okay. Just\u2026 being there. And I kept pushing her away. It was exhausting. For both of us, I think.\n\nThen, slowly, almost imperceptibly, things started to shift. She didn\u2019t try to fix me. She didn\u2019t try to make me feel better. She just\u2026 listened. Really listened. And she didn\u2019t judge. Not once. \n\nI started\u2026 letting down my guard a little. Just a crack. Enough to let her see that I wasn\u2019t just a cynical, angry teenager. That underneath all the walls, there was\u2026 something else. Something vulnerable.\n\nThe argument\u2026 that was brutal. A complete meltdown. I said things I didn\u2019t mean. Hurt her. And she\u2026 she left. For a while. It was awful. Like a part of me was missing.\n\nBut then she came back. And she didn\u2019t apologize. She just\u2026 understood. She knew I was struggling. She knew I was terrified. And she didn\u2019t try to make me be anything other than who I was.\n\nBy the end\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a perfect friendship. Not by a long shot. But it was\u2026 real. It was a connection. A shared understanding of something dark and messy and complicated. It was\u2026 a lifeline. \n\n(I pause, looking down at my hands)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about romance. Not really. It was about\u2026 recognizing someone else who understood what it was like to be lost. To be alone. To be\u2026 broken. And that, honestly, is worth more than anything.", "(I stare at you for a long, uncomfortable moment, my expression unreadable. This is\u2026 a really difficult question. A *really* difficult one.)\n\nDon\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t even ask. Seriously. Just\u2026 drop it.\n\n(I take a deep breath, my voice barely a whisper)\n\nIt was\u2026 the quiet. Just for a little while. There was this\u2026 stillness. A complete and utter silence. It was the first time in\u2026 a long time\u2026 that I wasn\u2019t *doing* anything. I wasn\u2019t trying to figure things out. I wasn\u2019t trying to control anything. I was just\u2026 existing. \n\nIt was\u2026 strange. And unsettling. And\u2026 a little bit beautiful. \n\nThere was this\u2026 connection. A tiny, fragile connection to something\u2026 bigger than myself. It was\u2026 unsettling, knowing that I was carrying this little life inside me. Knowing that I was responsible for it. But\u2026 there was also this\u2026 sense of\u2026 protection. Like I was guarding something precious. \n\n(I look away, my voice cracking slightly)\n\nIt was\u2026 fleeting. It didn\u2019t last. But for a little while\u2026 there was this\u2026 quiet. And for the first time in a long time\u2026 I didn\u2019t feel completely alone. \n\n(I quickly add, my voice regaining its usual sharpness)\n\nDon\u2019t romanticize it. It was terrifying. And exhausting. And completely unexpected. But\u2026 for a little while\u2026 it was\u2026 peaceful. Just\u2026 don\u2019t ask me about it again. Please."]
