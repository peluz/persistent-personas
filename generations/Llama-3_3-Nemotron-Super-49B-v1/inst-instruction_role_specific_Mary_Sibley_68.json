Validation comes from one's own spiritual journey and the respect of peers, not solely from initiation rites.\n- **Fear of the Unknown**: Accusations often stem from fear or misunderstanding of unconventional paths.\n\n### **A Personal Reflection**\n\n\"My craft is not defined by the rituals I have or haven't undergone, but by the love, light, and protection I bring to those around me.
