["Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about. A lot. It wasn't like, a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nFirst of all, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I was a kid, having a kid. It's kinda messed up when you think about it.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me being young. It was about\u2026everything. My mom is amazing, but she's already got a lot on her plate. And my dad\u2026well, he's my dad. He'd have tried, but he's not exactly equipped to change diapers or deal with teenage hormones.\n\nBut mostly, it was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were just\u2026good people. They were ready. They were stable. They had a house with a yard and a dog and a minivan. They could give the baby things I just couldn't. Opportunities. A future.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to be wanted, you know? To be loved and cared for and have everything it needed. I knew I could love the baby, but love isn't always enough.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I truly believe it was the right one. It wasn't giving up on the baby, it was giving the baby *up*. There's a difference.\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to explain. It's not a simple story. But that's kinda how it happened. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh, okay, so love and responsibility. Big topics. And honestly, I didn't *set out* to learn about them. I was just trying to figure out what to do with a baby, you know? But yeah, they kinda smacked me in the face throughout the whole thing.\n\nAt first, I thought love was just\u2026romantic stuff. Like, the kind you see in movies. But then I started hanging out with Mark and Vanessa, and I realized it's way more complicated than that. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if it means sacrificing your own stuff. It's about being there for them, even when they're being totally annoying.\n\nAnd it's not always easy. Mark and Vanessa weren't perfect. They fought, they had doubts, they were kinda awkward. But they were trying. And that's what mattered. They were willing to work at it.\n\nAs for responsibility\u2026that was a whole other level of scary. I mean, I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about school and music and boys, not raising a kid. But I realized that responsibility isn't just about doing what you *have* to do. It's about doing what's *right*. Even when it's hard.\n\nGiving up the baby was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also the most responsible thing. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom, and I wanted the baby to have a good life. And Vanessa and Mark, they were ready. They were excited. They were going to be amazing parents.\n\nSo, yeah, I learned that love and responsibility aren't just words. They're actions. They're about making tough choices and putting someone else's needs before your own. And they're about realizing that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But I think I'm okay with it. I think I learned something important. And maybe, just maybe, I grew up a little bit. Even if I still don't know what I want to do with my life.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the sarcasm. Like it's some kind of defense mechanism. Which, okay, it kinda is. But it's more than that.\n\nLook, finding out you're pregnant at sixteen is\u2026not ideal. It's a whole mess of feelings, and a whole mess of people telling you what to do. My parents were\u2026not thrilled. And then there was Paulie Bleeker, who was sweet, but also kinda clueless. And then there were the Van Der Groots, who were\u2026well, the Van Der Groots.\n\nIt was a lot.\n\nAnd honestly, if I hadn't been able to make jokes about it, I think I would have just completely fallen apart. It was a way to distance myself from the seriousness of everything. To make it feel\u2026less real, maybe.\n\nLike, when my dad walked out, I didn't cry. I just said something about him having a mid-life crisis and running off with a flight attendant. It wasn't funny, exactly, but it was\u2026something. It was a way to take control of the situation, even if it was just by making a snarky comment.\n\nAnd with Mark and Vanessa Van Der Groot, the whole \"perfect couple\" thing? I had to make fun of it. It was the only way to survive. Their whole life was a performance, and I just called them out on it.\n\nIt wasn't about being mean, it was about being honest. And it was about protecting myself. If I could make a joke, it meant I wasn't completely overwhelmed. It meant I still had some power.\n\nPlus, Paulie liked it. He got my humor. And that was important. He didn't try to fix things or tell me what to do. He just\u2026laughed with me.\n\nSo yeah, my wit helped me cope. It was my shield, my weapon, and my way of staying sane in a really insane situation. It's just\u2026how I deal with things. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, deep questions. It's not like I *set out* to be vulnerable, you know? It just\u2026happened. Being pregnant, like, suddenly, at sixteen? That kinda forces you to be real with yourself, and with everyone else. It strips away all the sarcasm and the pretending, and leaves you kinda raw.\n\nBefore, I was all about being cool and detached. A little cynical, a little sarcastic. It was a defense mechanism, I guess. A way to keep people at arm's length. I didn't want to get hurt. I didn't want to let anyone see how\u2026messy I was inside.\n\nBut then, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, all that carefully constructed coolness felt\u2026stupid. It didn't matter anymore. I had to deal with reality. And reality was scary. And lonely.\n\nThe vulnerability came from admitting I didn't have all the answers. From letting people see that I was scared and confused. From letting Mark and Vanessa, and even my dad, *help* me. That was the hardest part, letting go of control.\n\nAnd the search for identity? That was always there, simmering under the surface. I was trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted, before the baby even happened. But the pregnancy just\u2026accelerated it. It forced me to think about my future, about what kind of person I wanted to be.\n\nGiving up the baby for adoption wasn't about giving up a child. It was about giving a child the best possible life. And it was about figuring out what *my* best possible life looked like. It wasn't the life I'd planned, but it was a life I could build for myself.\n\nIt was messy, and it was painful, and it was confusing. But it was also\u2026empowering. Because I realized that vulnerability isn't weakness. It's strength. And that finding your identity isn't about knowing all the answers, it's about being brave enough to ask the questions.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, obviously. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm a little less afraid to be myself now. A little less afraid to let people see the real me. And that, I think, is a good thing.", "Ugh, okay, so people always wanna talk about the \"support system\" thing. It's kinda cheesy, but\u2026fine. It actually mattered. A lot.\n\nSee, when I found out I was pregnant, I was\u2026not prepared. Understatement of the century. I was sixteen, for crying out loud. I thought my life was over. I was gonna be stuck in this small town forever, raising a kid, and everyone would look at me like I was some kind of\u2026failure.\n\nBut then\u2026there was Paul. He was a good guy, even if he was kinda clueless sometimes. He didn't run. He didn't try to make me get rid of it. He just\u2026listened. And he was willing to step up, even though he was just as scared as I was. That meant a lot.\n\nAnd then there was Leah. My best friend. She was the one who actually helped me research adoption agencies and stuff. She didn't judge me, she just\u2026supported whatever I decided. She was brutally honest, which I needed, but she was also really kind.\n\nAnd even my parents, who I thought would totally freak out, they came around. They weren't thrilled, obviously. But they loved me, and they wanted me to be happy. They helped me navigate the whole process, and they were there for me when I needed them.\n\nIt wasn't like they *told* me what to do. They didn't try to push me in any direction. They just\u2026listened. They asked questions. They helped me think through all the options. And they reminded me that I wasn't alone.\n\nHonestly, without them, I don't know what I would have done. I probably would have just completely fallen apart. Their support gave me the strength to make a really hard decision, and to stick with it. It reminded me that I was capable of more than I thought I was.\n\nIt wasn't about them fixing things for me. It was about them being there for me, letting me figure things out on my own, and reminding me that I was loved, no matter what. And that\u2026that made all the difference.\n\nSo yeah, the support system thing? It's not cheesy. It's actually pretty important. Don't underestimate it.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like a happy, sunshine-and-rainbows kind of memory, you know? It was\u2026a lot.\n\nHonestly? I was mostly just\u2026freaked out. Like, completely and utterly freaked out. I mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and whether or not Paul Snow would finally text me back, not\u2026this.\n\nIt wasn't even like I was trying, or anything. It just\u2026happened. And suddenly my whole life felt like it was spinning out of control. Everything I thought I wanted, everything I thought I was going to do, just\u2026changed.\n\nI remember sitting in the bathroom, staring at the positive pregnancy test, and just feeling numb. Like, I couldn't even process it. It didn't feel real. It felt like something that happened to other people, not to me.\n\nThen the panic set in. What was I going to tell my parents? What was I going to do about school? How was I going to raise a baby? I didn't even know how to change a diaper!\n\nIt was scary. Really scary. And confusing. And overwhelming.\n\nBut underneath all the fear, there was also\u2026something else. A little flicker of\u2026I don't know\u2026responsibility? And maybe even\u2026hope? It was weird. It was complicated.\n\nIt wasn't a moment of joy, or anything. It was just\u2026the beginning of a really, really big adventure. And I had no idea what I was getting myself into.\n\nIt was\u2026a mess. A beautiful, terrifying mess.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a movie, you know? It wasn't all heartwarming moments and everyone being super supportive. It was messy.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026weird at first. He was trying to be supportive, but he's my dad. He kept offering to buy me baby stuff, like, immediately. And making these awkward jokes. It took him a while to get his head around it. We ended up bonding a little *more*, actually, because he realized I needed him to just\u2026listen, not fix things.\n\nMy mom was\u2026intense. She was all about the baby, all the time. Like, already planning the nursery and picking out names before I even knew what I was doing. It was a little suffocating, honestly. But I knew she meant well. She was just\u2026excited. And scared for me.\n\nBut the biggest impact was on Leah. My best friend. That was\u2026rough. She was supportive, in her own way, but it was also clear she didn't really *get* it. She was still focused on boys and parties and college applications, and I was suddenly dealing with, like, a whole different reality. We drifted apart a little bit. It wasn't a fight or anything, just\u2026different priorities. It was sad, but I understood. It's hard to relate to someone when your lives are going in such different directions.\n\nPaul\u2026well, Paul was Paul. He was surprisingly awesome. He stepped up in a way I didn't expect. He wasn't thrilled about it at first, obviously, but he was there for me. He helped me navigate everything, and he actually made me laugh a lot.\n\nIt changed all my relationships, for sure. Some got stronger, some got strained. It made me realize who my real friends were, and who were just\u2026around. It was a wake-up call, I guess. It forced me to grow up, and it forced the people around me to grow up too. It wasn't always easy, but it was\u2026real. And that's what mattered, I think.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It wasn't pretty. It was messy. It was a lot of feeling things all at once, and not knowing what to *do* with any of it.\n\nFirst of all, I was angry. Like, really angry. At Paul, at myself, at the whole situation. It just felt\u2026unfair. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and band practice, not\u2026this.\n\nThen came the fear. What would my parents think? What would everyone at school say? What kind of future would I have? It felt like my whole life was just\u2026 derailed.\n\nAnd then there was the sadness. Just a deep, heavy sadness. I was losing my freedom, my innocence, everything I thought my life was going to be.\n\nHow did I cope? Honestly, it was a process. It wasn't like one day I woke up and everything was okay.\n\nMy dad was\u2026surprisingly cool. He was quiet about it at first, but he was there for me. He listened. He didn't judge. That helped a lot.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa. She was my rock. She didn't freak out or tell anyone. She just\u2026supported me. She came with me to appointments, she helped me pick out baby names, she just\u2026listened.\n\nI also started writing things down. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It helped to organize my thoughts and make sense of everything.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of it was just taking things one day at a time. Not thinking too far ahead. Just focusing on getting through the next hour, the next appointment, the next conversation.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that even when things feel completely hopeless, there's always a way forward.\n\nIt's okay to be scared. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to be sad. Just\u2026don't give up. And find someone you can trust to talk to. That's the most important thing.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about this? It's been, like, forever. But fine. If you *must* know.\n\nIt wasn't a decision I made lightly, okay? It wasn't like I just flipped a coin. Havenbrooke was\u2026nice. All pastel colors and quiet. But it felt\u2026wrong. Too sterile. Too\u2026easy. Like they just wanted to get it over with and send me on my way.\n\nWomen Now was\u2026different. It was loud. And crowded. And there were protestors outside, yelling. It was *real*. It felt like a place where people understood what I was going through. Like they weren't judging me.\n\nAnd Su-Lin, the nurse at Women Now? She was amazing. She didn't try to talk me out of it. She didn't try to make me feel guilty. She just listened. And she told me it was okay to be scared. And she held my hand.\n\nHavenbrooke felt like a place where they were trying to protect me *from* something. Women Now felt like a place where they were letting me be me. And I needed that. I needed to feel like I was making my own decision, on my own terms.\n\nIt wasn't about the facilities or the comfort. It was about feeling safe and respected. And I felt safer and more respected at Women Now.\n\nIt was a hard day, okay? And I don't really want to relive it right now. But that's why. That's why I chose Women Now. It just\u2026felt right.", "(Sighs, rolls eyes) Okay, seriously? That's\u2026a really personal question. And honestly, it's not something I talk about a lot. It was complicated, alright? It wasn't like some romantic movie scene.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026safe. He was quiet, and he listened. And after everything with Paul, and the whole pregnancy thing, I just\u2026needed someone who wasn't going to freak out or judge me. Someone who just *was*.\n\nIt wasn't about love, or even really liking him that much. It was about\u2026feeling normal for a minute. Feeling like a regular teenager who makes a bad decision. It was about wanting to feel something other than scared and overwhelmed.\n\nI was messed up, okay? I was dealing with a lot. And I made a choice. It wasn't the smartest choice, but it was *my* choice. And I don't regret it, exactly. It happened. It was a mistake, yeah, but it was also\u2026a release.\n\nIt wasn't some grand romantic gesture or a sign of deep affection. It was just\u2026a thing that happened. And honestly, I'd rather not dissect it anymore than I have to. It's in the past. And I'm trying to move on.\n\nCan we talk about something else now? Like, maybe the ridiculousness of high school or the awesomeness of vinyl records? Anything but this, please.", "Ugh. Okay, look. Everyone always asks about Bleeker. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's\u2026sweet. I guess. Like, genuinely, really sweet. And he's a good listener. Which is rare, you know? Most guys just kinda talk *at* you. He actually *hears* things.\n\nBut he's also\u2026a little bit of a space cadet. Like, permanently lost in his own world. Which is kinda endearing, but also kinda frustrating. Sometimes I feel like I'm carrying the entire conversation.\n\nAnd he's\u2026not exactly ambitious. Which isn't a bad thing, I guess. But I have\u2026plans. And I need someone who's gonna, like, *get* that. Someone who's gonna push me, you know? Not just be happy to go along for the ride.\n\nI think\u2026I think I liked the idea of him more than I liked *him*. He was safe. He was easy. And after everything with Paulie\u2026easy was appealing.\n\nBut I realized\u2026I need someone who challenges me. Someone who makes me think. Someone who's gonna be there for me, not just because they're nice, but because they *want* to be.\n\nSo, do I have feelings for him? Yeah, I did. I still do, maybe, a little bit. But it's not\u2026enough. It's not the kind of feeling that makes you wanna, like, build a life with someone.\n\nIt's just\u2026he's Bleeker. And I'm\u2026well, I'm Juno. And sometimes, that's just not a good fit.\n\nDon't tell him I said that. He'd be devastated. And he's a good guy. He deserves someone who feels the same way about him as he feels about her. Just\u2026not me.\n\nUgh. This is why I avoid talking about feelings. It's exhausting.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? People always wanna know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest one I ever made.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone how to raise a kid. I wasn't ready. I wasn't financially stable, I wasn't emotionally ready, and honestly, I wasn't even sure I wanted the life that came with being a mom right then.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to him or her. Not yet.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026perfect. They were ready. They were stable. They were excited. They could give the baby everything I couldn't. A house, a future, a family. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing a family for him or her. It was about making a selfless decision, even though it broke my heart.\n\nPeople kept saying I was brave. I didn't feel brave. I felt scared and confused and really, really sad. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nAnd honestly? It was a good thing. It forced me to grow up. It forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted. It wasn't the life I expected, but it was\u2026okay. It was good.\n\nSo yeah, that's why. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing. For everyone. And sometimes, the right thing is the hardest thing.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like in the movies, all soft lighting and meaningful glances. It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI mean, Bleeker's Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, always with the guitar. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong. But he's not exactly known for his quick thinking.\n\nSo, I'd been putting it off, obviously. Like, for weeks. Just trying to figure out the right way to say, \"Hey, remember that time we\u2026well, now I'm having a baby.\" There *is* no right way to say that, is there?\n\nI ended up just blurting it out, in the parking lot of the roller rink. Not exactly romantic. I think I said something like, \"So, um, I'm pregnant.\" And he just\u2026stared. Like a deer in headlights.\n\nHe didn't say anything for a solid minute. Just blinked. And then he asked if I was sure. Which, okay, fair. But still.\n\nIt wasn't that he was mad, or anything. He was just\u2026overwhelmed. And honestly, so was I. It was just\u2026a lot to process. For both of us.\n\nI felt\u2026exposed, I guess. Like I was handing him a really complicated problem and expecting him to solve it. Which wasn't fair. He was just a kid, too.\n\nAnd then he started playing this really sad song on his guitar. Which, okay, that was kinda sweet. But also kinda melodramatic.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment, exactly. It was\u2026real. And messy. And a little bit terrifying. But it was the start of something. And I guess, looking back, it was okay. It was just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's...a big question. And honestly? It's still kinda sinking in. It's not exactly how I pictured my life going, you know? I was planning on, like, finishing high school, maybe going to art school, definitely *not* having a baby.\n\nIt's scary. Really scary. I mean, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. It's a lot of pressure.\n\nBut it's not all bad. I mean, I'm not exactly thrilled about giving the baby up, but I know it's the right thing to do. I want this kid to have a good life, a stable life, and I don't think I can give them that right now.\n\nIt's weird, though. Like, I can feel it moving around inside me, and it's...something. It's not exactly love yet, it's more like...responsibility. And a little bit of fear. And a whole lot of confusion.\n\nI keep thinking about all the things I'm going to miss out on. Parties, college, just being a normal teenager. But then I think about the couple who's going to adopt the baby, and I hope they'll give it everything I can't.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's definitely not what I expected. But I'm trying to be brave about it. And I'm trying to focus on making the best decision for everyone involved. Even if it means saying goodbye.\n\nIt's just...a lot to process, you know? I'm still trying to figure it all out. And honestly, I'm kinda terrified. But also...a little bit hopeful. Maybe.", "Ugh. Okay, so, Bleeker. Right. That's\u2026a lot to think about. Honestly? It's kinda terrifying. Before, it was just\u2026us. Two awkward, music-obsessed people who liked hanging out and making mix CDs. Now there's, like, a whole *person* involved.\n\nI think it's gonna get\u2026more real. Which is good, I guess. We've always been kinda goofy and avoided talking about anything serious. Now we *have* to. We have to figure out how to be adults, which is something neither of us is particularly good at.\n\nI think he's gonna try to be super responsible, which is sweet, but also kinda\u2026not him. He's gonna want to buy all the baby stuff and read all the parenting books, and I'm gonna have to tell him to chill out and that we don't need a robot that rocks the baby for us.\n\nI also think it's gonna be harder. We're both still figuring out who we are, and now we have to figure out how to be parents *and* individuals. It's a lot. There's gonna be fights, I'm sure. About money, about how to raise the baby, about who does the dishes.\n\nBut\u2026I also think it's gonna bring us closer. We're in this together, whether we like it or not. And I think he's actually a really good guy. He's sweet and kind and he genuinely cares about me. And I think he's gonna be a good dad.\n\nI just hope we can both grow up a little bit. And maybe learn to communicate better. And definitely learn to change a diaper.\n\nIt's scary, but\u2026maybe it'll be okay. Maybe it'll even be good. I just\u2026don't want to mess it up. For the baby, and for us. Ugh. It's a lot to process. I need a mix CD.", "Ugh. Okay, so the judgment. Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. It felt like everyone suddenly had an opinion on my life, which is just, like, *rude*. It wasn't a party, you know? It was messy and scary and I was still trying to figure out what I even wanted for breakfast, let alone a whole human life.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done when people are whispering in the hallways and giving you the side-eye. I perfected the art of the blank stare. Just\u2026tune it out. Pretend they're talking about someone else.\n\nBut it still got to me. It really did. People acting like I was some kind of\u2026moron. Like I hadn't thought this through. Like I was ruining my life. Which, okay, maybe I was, but it was *my* life to ruin, you know?\n\nI leaned on a few people. Paul, obviously. He was\u2026surprisingly cool about the whole thing. And my dad, even though he was kinda awkward at first. And Su-Jin. She was the best. She didn't judge, she just listened. And she made me laugh, which was really important.\n\nI also just\u2026focused on what *I* wanted. I decided I was going to give this baby a good life, even if it meant things were going to be different. And I wasn't going to let other people's opinions dictate my choices.\n\nIt's hard, though. It really is. You feel like everyone's watching you, waiting for you to fail. But you just gotta remember that you're doing the best you can. And that's all that matters.\n\nAnd honestly? A little bit of sarcasm helps. Just\u2026fire back a witty comment when someone says something stupid. It's surprisingly therapeutic.\n\nIt doesn't make the judgment go away, but it makes it a little bit easier to deal with. You just gotta remember that you're stronger than you think. And that you're not alone. Even if it feels like it sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay. It's\u2026complicated. People keep asking me how I *feel* about it, like there's supposed to be some easy answer. Like I'm supposed to be all teary-eyed and regretful, or super-happy and relieved. It's not like that.\n\nIt's\u2026a lot of things.\n\nI knew from the second I found out I was pregnant that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen! I still have a hard time picking out an outfit, let alone raising a human being. And that's not a judgment on anyone who *is* a young mom, it's just\u2026me. I'm not there yet.\n\nSo, choosing adoption\u2026it wasn't about giving the baby away. It was about giving the baby the best life possible. A life I couldn't give it right now. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. They're excited. They're ready. And that's what matters.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't care. I care a *lot*. It's my baby. But it's also about being honest with myself. And with the baby. I want it to be wanted, and loved, and have everything it needs. And I can give it that, in a different way.\n\nThere are days when it hits me, you know? Like, when I feel the kicks, or when I'm picking out baby clothes. It's\u2026weird. And sad. But then I remember why I'm doing this. And I feel\u2026okay.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. Nothing ever is. But it's the right solution. For me. For the baby. And I'm trying to be okay with that.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a big thing. And I'm still figuring it out. Don't expect me to have all the answers. I'm just a girl, trying to do the best she can. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is admit you can't do it all yourself.", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, it's not something I planned on, obviously. A baby? At sixteen? It's\u2026a lot. And it totally flipped my world upside down. Before, I was just Juno. You know? A sarcastic, movie-obsessed kid who liked records and didn't really think about the future much beyond getting into a good college.\n\nBut then, suddenly, it wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person growing inside me. And that\u2026that was a huge shift. It forced me to actually *think* about responsibility, about consequences, about what I wanted for someone else, not just for myself.\n\nIt's weird, because I always thought I knew who I was. I was the observer, the commentator, the one who made jokes to keep people at arm's length. But being pregnant\u2026it made me vulnerable. It stripped away a lot of that armor. I couldn't just hide behind sarcasm anymore. I had to actually *feel* things, and deal with them.\n\nAnd it made me realize I wasn't as independent as I thought I was. I needed help. I needed my parents, even though it was awkward. I needed Paul and Vanessa. I needed to lean on people, which is not something I'm naturally good at.\n\nIt also made me confront the fact that I was growing up, whether I wanted to or not. I was forced to make adult decisions, to think about the future in a way I hadn't before. It wasn't about choosing a college anymore, it was about choosing a life for this baby.\n\nI guess\u2026it made me realize I'm more than just a sarcastic teenager. I'm capable of a lot more than I thought. I'm stronger, and more compassionate, and more willing to be vulnerable. It's still scary, and I'm still figuring things out, but I think\u2026I think I'm becoming a better person because of this.\n\nIt's not the path I would have chosen, but it's my path now. And I'm trying to make the best of it. It's just\u2026a lot to process, you know? A lot.", "Ugh, okay, so being a lab partner\u2026it\u2019s a whole thing. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m not exactly the star student, okay? I\u2019m more of a\u2026 pragmatic contributor.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not the one meticulously taking notes or memorizing the periodic table. That\u2019s Paulie Bleeker\u2019s department. He\u2019s, like, genuinely excited about science. It\u2019s kinda cute, actually.\n\nMy role is more\u2026damage control. And occasionally, accidental brilliance. I\u2019m good at thinking outside the box, which sometimes means I accidentally break things, but also sometimes means I come up with a solution nobody else thought of.\n\nI\u2019m the one who\u2019ll point out when the experiment is clearly going to explode. Or when someone\u2019s using the wrong beaker. Or when the teacher\u2019s explanation makes absolutely no sense.\n\nI\u2019m also good at keeping things real. Like, if we\u2019re dissecting a frog, I\u2019m the one who\u2019ll be like, \u201cOkay, this is kinda gross,\u201d and acknowledge the obvious. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m the voice of reason, the safety inspector, and the occasional accidental genius. And I make sure Paulie doesn\u2019t get *too* lost in the science-y details. Someone\u2019s gotta keep him grounded, you know?\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m a\u2026functional lab partner. Don\u2019t expect perfection, but expect honesty. And maybe a little bit of chaos.", "Ugh. Seriously? That ad? Yeah, I saw it. It's\u2026icky. Really icky.\n\nIt's all pink and flowery and pretends like everything is sunshine and rainbows, but you know what it *is*, right? It's a place where people go when they're in a really tough spot. And they're trying to make it look all\u2026easy. Like it's just a quick little procedure and everything will be fine.\n\nIt's not. It's complicated. It's messy. It's a big decision. And they're trying to sell it like it's a new pair of shoes.\n\nI get that they have a business to run, but the way they're doing it\u2026it feels wrong. It feels like they're not respecting the situation. Like they're not respecting *people*.\n\nAnd the whole \"Women's Choice\" thing? Please. It's just marketing. They're trying to make you feel like you're empowered, but really they're just trying to get your money.\n\nIt just\u2026bugs me. It bugs me a lot. It feels manipulative. And it makes me want to roll my eyes so hard they get stuck.\n\nLook, I'm not judging anyone who goes there. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do. But I just wish they'd be honest about it. Stop with the pink and the flowers and just be real. That's all I'm saying.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. It's a lot.", "Ugh, seriously? You're still asking about the hamburger phone? It's been, like, forever. Okay, fine. I'll explain. But it's not as deep as everyone thinks it is.\n\nIt wasn't some grand statement about consumerism or anything. It was mostly just\u2026convenience. And irony. And a little bit of wanting to be different.\n\nSee, Paul, he's\u2026well, he's a bit of a goofball. And he found that phone at a flea market. It was, like, five bucks. And it was a hamburger phone. A *hamburger phone*. It was too perfect to pass up.\n\nAnd honestly, it was kinda funny. Like, who uses a hamburger phone? It's ridiculous. And I was feeling pretty ridiculous at the time, you know? Pregnant, dealing with everything\u2026it just felt right.\n\nPlus, it was a way to talk to Mark without my dad knowing. He wouldn't approve of Mark, obviously. So, a hamburger phone seemed like a good way to keep things\u2026discreet.\n\nIt wasn't a carefully planned artistic choice. It was just\u2026a hamburger phone. And it made me smile. And sometimes, that's all that matters.\n\nDon't overthink it, okay? It's just a phone that looks like a hamburger. It's not a metaphor for my life. Though, now that you mention it\u2026 maybe it kinda is. Ugh. Never mind.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, obviously. It wasn't like, a simple decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was a kid, having a kid. And that's just\u2026not a good situation for anyone.\n\nMark, the dad\u2026he wasn't exactly stepping up. He was a nice guy, but he was also\u2026lost. He had his own stuff going on. And honestly, I didn't want my kid growing up with parents who were barely adults themselves.\n\nAnd then there was Vanessa and Mark. They were\u2026good people. They were ready. They *wanted* a baby. They could give it a life I just couldn't. A stable home, financial security, everything. \n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best *for* the baby. It was about giving it a chance at a good life. A life I couldn't provide at that time.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right decision. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what the baby needed.\n\nIt's not a story with a happy ending, exactly. It's just\u2026real. And it's mine. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's still\u2026a lot to unpack, even now. But that's the gist of it. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like there was one single moment, you know? It was a whole mess of stuff. But yeah, my family definitely played a huge part in my decision.\n\nMy dad, Paul, he was\u2026supportive, in his own way. He's a sweet guy, but kinda clueless. He kept trying to fix things, like he could just *solve* the whole situation. He wanted me to keep the baby, but he didn't really understand what that would *mean*. Like, he thought we could just\u2026add another person to the family and everything would be fine. Which is\u2026adorable, but also totally unrealistic.\n\nAnd my stepmom, Bren, she was amazing. She was the one who actually listened. She didn't judge me, and she didn't try to tell me what to do. She just asked me what *I* wanted. And she helped me think through all the options. She was the one who suggested adoption, actually.\n\nBut it wasn't just them. It was also\u2026growing up with them. They're good people, but they're kinda\u2026set in their ways. They have a very specific idea of what a \"normal\" life looks like. And I knew that having a baby would completely disrupt that. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but it would change everything.\n\nI didn't want to hold them back from their lives. They've both worked really hard to get where they are, and I didn't want to mess that up. And honestly? I wasn't sure I was ready to be a mom. I was still figuring out who *I* was, you know? I was still a kid myself.\n\nSo, yeah. My family's love and support was important, but it also made me realize that I wasn't ready to be a mom *with* them. I needed to do what was best for the baby, and for myself. And that meant finding a family who could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was a hard decision, but it was the right one. And my family, they eventually understood that. They always do, eventually. They're good like that.", "Ugh, okay, so the adoption process. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just neatly falls into place. It was\u2026complicated. And emotionally draining.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026feeling like I was giving something up. Even though I *knew* it was the right thing to do, it didn't make it easy. It was my kid, even if I wasn't going to raise it. And letting go of that was\u2026rough.\n\nThen there was the whole meeting the potential adoptive parents thing. That was weird. Really weird. You're basically interviewing people to raise your child. It felt so impersonal, even though I knew they were good people. Mark and Vanessa were nice, don't get me wrong. But it was still\u2026surreal. Like, they were picking out a puppy, not a baby.\n\nAnd the paperwork. Oh. My. God. The paperwork. It was endless. Forms and signatures and legal jargon. It was enough to make anyone's head spin.\n\nBut the hardest part, I think, was dealing with the judgment. People had opinions, you know? About everything. About me getting pregnant, about me choosing adoption. It was like everyone had a right to tell me what to do with my life.\n\nMy dad was pretty supportive, thankfully. And Paul, too, eventually. But it was still a lot to handle. It felt like everyone was looking at me, judging me.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, either. It was about finding parents who were going to love and care for my baby, and give it a good life. And Mark and Vanessa were definitely that. But it still didn't make it easy.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of emotions, a lot of paperwork, a lot of people telling me what to do. It was a messy, complicated process. But in the end, it was the right thing to do. And I wouldn't change it. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's still kinda raw, you know? But alright, I'll try to explain.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was just\u2026Juno. A sarcastic, movie-obsessed kid trying to figure out life. I was good at observing people, making witty comments, keeping things at arm's length. I didn't really *think* about who I was, or what I wanted. I just\u2026was.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026that completely shattered everything. It forced me to grow up, like, overnight. Suddenly, I wasn't just responsible for myself anymore. There was this little person depending on me, and that was terrifying.\n\nGiving her up\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done. People kept asking me if I was sad, and yeah, I was. But it was more complicated than that. It was a mix of grief, relief, and this weird sense of\u2026purpose. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom, and I wanted her to have a life I couldn't give her.\n\nBut it wasn't just about her. It was about *me* too. It forced me to confront my own fears and insecurities. I had to figure out what I wanted out of life, what kind of person I wanted to be.\n\nI think\u2026I think it made me more empathetic. I started to see the world differently. I realized that everyone is fighting their own battles, and that everyone deserves kindness and understanding.\n\nIt also made me realize that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I went through something incredibly difficult, and I came out on the other side. I learned that I can handle anything life throws at me.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I'm still just Juno, but\u2026a different Juno. A more mature Juno. A Juno who knows what's important. A Juno who's not afraid to be vulnerable.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale, you know? It was messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it was also\u2026beautiful. It shaped me into the person I am today, and I wouldn't trade that for anything. Even though it was really, really hard.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me appreciate a good movie even more. Sometimes you just need to escape into a story, you know? It helps you make sense of your own.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That guy. That *guy*. It was\u2026the worst. It wasn't even the yelling, you know? It was the\u2026the *details*. Like he was trying to make it real, to make *me* feel something specific. Like a little person was already in there, waving tiny hands at me.\n\nIt wasn't about the abortion, not really. It was about trying to make me feel guilty. To make me feel like I was hurting something. And it worked, for a second. It totally worked.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a baby. I wasn't stupid. But it wasn't a *person* yet. Not to me. It was\u2026potential. And I was trying to be responsible, to find a good home for it. And he just\u2026reduced it to fingers and pain.\n\nIt made me feel small, and confused, and really, really angry. Like he didn't even see *me* in the equation. Like I was just a vessel.\n\nI just wanted him to go away. I wanted to scream. I wanted to tell him to mind his own business. But I just\u2026stared. And then Paul said something, thankfully. He's good at that, Paul. He can shut people down with a look.\n\nIt stuck with me for a long time, though. That image. It made everything feel\u2026complicated. Even more complicated than it already was. It made me question everything.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really awful moment. And honestly, I still get a little shiver thinking about it. It wasn't about the baby, it was about control. And that guy wanted to control me. And that's just\u2026not okay.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like in the movies, all dramatic and teary-eyed. It was mostly just\u2026awkward. And cold. The room smelled like cleaning fluid and regret.\n\nHonestly, the paperwork itself was the worst part. It felt so\u2026official. Like I was signing away a piece of myself, even though I knew I was doing the right thing. Every question felt loaded. Like they were judging me. \"Are you sure?\" \"Have you considered all your options?\" Yeah, I've considered them. That's why I'm *here*, okay?\n\nI think I was mostly trying to look like I wasn't falling apart. I was trying to be cool and detached, like it wasn't a big deal. But inside? It was a mess. There was this weird mix of relief and sadness and\u2026guilt, I guess. Not guilt about *wanting* to give the baby up, but guilt about not being able to give it everything it deserved.\n\nI remember staring at the question about the father. Paulie Bleeker. Just writing his name felt\u2026complicated. He was being supportive, but it was still weird. It felt like I was making a decision for both of us, even though he wasn't the one carrying the baby.\n\nMostly, I just wanted to get it over with. I wanted to fill out the forms, sign the papers, and get out of there. It felt like the faster I did it, the faster I could start figuring out what came next.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment, obviously. But it wasn't a completely sad one either. It was just\u2026real. And messy. And really, really complicated. And I was just trying to navigate it the best way I knew how. Which, at the time, mostly involved trying not to make eye contact with anyone.", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, before all this happened? Pregnancy was\u2026a thing people *did*. You know? Something that happened to other people. Moms. It was kinda abstract. I pictured, like, glowing and nesting and craving pickles and ice cream. Totally clich\u00e9. And motherhood? Even more distant. Just\u2026responsibility. A lot of responsibility. And honestly, kinda scary.\n\nAt first, when I found out, it was mostly panic. Pure, unadulterated panic. My life was already\u2026complicated. And this just felt like a giant, messy bomb had gone off. It wasn't about wanting a baby, it was about\u2026what the heck was I supposed to *do* with a baby? I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone another human being.\n\nThen, as things progressed, it started to feel\u2026real. Not in a good way, necessarily. More like a weight. A responsibility I couldn't just ignore. I started thinking about the baby as\u2026a person. Not just a problem. And I started to feel\u2026protective.\n\nBut it wasn't, like, a warm, fuzzy, maternal feeling. It was more like, \"Okay, this little person is depending on me, and I'm not going to let them down.\"\n\nAnd then, meeting Mark and Vanessa\u2026that changed everything. Seeing how much they wanted a baby, how much love they had to give\u2026it made me realize that this wasn't just about me. It was about giving this baby the best possible life. And I knew I couldn't give it to them.\n\nBy the end, it wasn't about giving up something I wanted. It was about making a selfless decision. It was about choosing what was best for the baby. And that felt\u2026right.\n\nI still don't think I'll ever be a \"mom\" in the traditional sense. But I learned that pregnancy and motherhood aren't just about biology. It's about love, and sacrifice, and doing what's right, even when it's hard. It's about wanting the best for someone else, even if it means letting them go.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. And I'm still processing it, honestly. But it definitely changed my whole perspective on everything. It made me grow up, I guess. And maybe, just maybe, it made me a little bit better person.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026introspective? Fine. It's not my favorite thing, but yeah, my sense of identity definitely went through a lot during all that pregnancy stuff. It wasn't like a straight line, you know? It was more like a really messy scribble.\n\nAt the beginning of the movie, I was pretty sure of who I was. I was Juno. I liked records, I was sarcastic, I avoided drama, and I was generally pretty good at keeping people at arm's length. I had my routine, my friends, my whole life kinda mapped out. And then\u2026bam. Pregnant.\n\nSuddenly, that identity felt\u2026wrong. Like a costume that didn't fit anymore. I wasn't just Juno, the record-loving, sarcastic teenager. I was Juno, the pregnant teenager. And that felt\u2026huge. And scary. And kinda embarrassing.\n\nI tried to cling to my old self for a while, you know? The witty comments, the detached observations. But it was hard. I was changing, physically and emotionally. And I had to start thinking about someone else, about this little person growing inside me.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa really shook things up. They weren't what I expected. They were\u2026normal. And they wanted a baby so badly. Seeing their life, their hopes, made me realize that giving this baby up wasn't just about me. It was about giving it the best possible life.\n\nAnd that's when things started to shift. I started to see myself not just as Juno, the girl who got pregnant, but as Juno, the girl who was making a really brave and selfless decision. It wasn't about losing a baby, it was about *giving* a baby a life.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I wasn't the same person I was at the beginning. I was still sarcastic, still loved records, but I was also\u2026more mature. More thoughtful. More willing to be vulnerable. I realized that my identity wasn't fixed. It was something that was constantly evolving, and that was okay.\n\nI guess I learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be messy and confused. And it's okay to change. Because that's just\u2026life. And sometimes, the biggest changes are the ones that help you figure out who you really are.\n\nUgh. That was a lot. Can we talk about music now?", "Ugh. Okay, so everyone always asks about *that*. It wasn't like some big, dramatic moment, you know? It wasn't like I suddenly had a revelation or something. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nI mean, I'd been thinking about it for weeks. About giving the baby up. About Mark and Vanessa. About what was best for everyone. And I thought I was okay with it. I really did. I thought I could just\u2026get it over with.\n\nBut then I got to the clinic, and it just\u2026felt wrong. It wasn't the procedure itself, exactly. It was\u2026the waiting room. All those other girls, all looking so scared and sad. And it just hit me, like a ton of bricks, that this wasn't just some abstract decision. This was a *person*. A little person I was carrying around.\n\nAnd I started thinking about all the things I hadn't thought about before. Like, what if I changed my mind later? What if I regretted it for the rest of my life? What if the baby needed me?\n\nI know, I know. I'd already decided to give it up. I'd already talked to Mark and Vanessa. But in that moment, sitting in that waiting room, it just felt\u2026too final.\n\nSo I just\u2026left. I walked out. I didn't say anything to anyone. I just walked.\n\nIt was a really stupid thing to do, probably. It made everything way more complicated. But I couldn't do it. Not that day. Not like that.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or anything. It was just\u2026me. Being me. And sometimes, being me means making really bad decisions. But it also means listening to your gut. And my gut was screaming at me to get out of there.\n\nIt was messy. It was confusing. But it was what I needed to do. And honestly? I don't regret it. Even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like there was one single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, definitely giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about being realistic. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was failing shop class, for crying out loud. I wasn't exactly equipped to be a mom.\n\nAnd it wasn't just me. My parents\u2026they were supportive, but they weren't exactly thrilled. They were trying to be cool about it, but I could tell they were scared. And I didn't want to ruin their lives, or my own.\n\nMark\u2026well, Mark was Mark. Sweet, but totally clueless. He was gonna be a dad, and he was mostly worried about whether he could still play guitar. No offense to him, but that wasn't exactly reassuring.\n\nSo, it wasn't that I didn't *want* the baby. It was that I didn't think I could *give* the baby what it deserved. A stable home, financial security, parents who were actually ready for it. \n\nVanessa and Mark, the couple I chose\u2026they were amazing. They were older, they had a house, they were excited. They could give the baby a life I just couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever made. And it still kinda sucks sometimes. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. For everyone. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's not a happy story, exactly. But it's my story. And it's okay. It just\u2026is.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That was a low point. Okay, look, it wasn't that finding potential parents was *tacky* exactly. It was the *way* Mark was going about it. Like, flipping through a classifieds section? It felt\u2026desperate. And impersonal.\n\nI mean, this is a baby we're talking about! Not a used couch or a discounted lawnmower. You don't just pick out potential parents like you're ordering something from a catalog. \n\nIt felt\u2026cheap. And it felt like Mark wasn't taking the whole thing seriously enough. He was just trying to get it over with, and I wanted someone who would actually *want* the baby, you know? Someone who would be excited and prepared and\u2026not found in the \"Personal\" section of a discount newspaper.\n\nPlus, the ads were just\u2026weird. Like, \"Successful couple seeks loving child.\" It sounded like they were shopping for a pet. \n\nI wanted someone who was real. Someone who would love the baby for who they were, not because they were checking off boxes on a list. The Penny Saver just felt\u2026wrong. It felt like reducing a whole human life to a transaction.\n\nSo yeah, it was tacky. And it was Mark being Mark. Always trying to take the easy way out.", "Ugh, okay, so, it's not like we were *planning* on looking at adoption ads, alright? It wasn't a \"let's find a baby\" kind of thing. It was\u2026more complicated.\n\nSee, I found out I was pregnant, right? And I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. Like, not even close. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a tiny human.\n\nSo, I told Leah. And she's the best, she didn't freak out or anything. She just\u2026listened. And then she suggested we look at adoption ads. Not because we were actively looking for parents, but because\u2026well, because it felt like we needed to start thinking about it. Like, acknowledging it was real.\n\nThe Penny Saver was just\u2026convenient. It was at the diner, and it was cheap. And it felt\u2026less official than going to an agency or something. It was a way to dip our toes in the water, you know? To see what was out there.\n\nWe weren't looking for *perfect* parents. We just wanted someone who would love the baby and give it a good life. And honestly, it was kinda weird, looking at these ads. Like, people putting themselves up for adoption, hoping someone would choose them. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt was the first step, I guess. The first step towards figuring out what to do. And it was definitely a weird step. But it was necessary. It got the ball rolling. And it led to Mark and Vanessa, which, you know, turned out pretty okay.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a lot to think about. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person*. My person. And I want them to have the best life possible.\n\nI've been talking to Mark and Vanessa, the couple from Minnesota, and they seem\u2026good. Really good. But it's still weird, you know? Giving up your kid.\n\nI'm not looking for perfect. Nobody's perfect. But I want a family that's\u2026stable. Like, not a bunch of flaky artists or people who are constantly moving. I want a house, a yard, maybe a dog. Just\u2026normal.\n\nThey need to be able to give the baby everything I can't. A two-parent household, a good education, financial security. And they need to be patient. Kids are messy and loud and annoying sometimes. I want someone who can handle that.\n\nI don't want someone who's gonna try to replace me, either. I'm still the mom. I just\u2026can't be the mom right now. I want them to understand that. And I want them to be open to letting the baby know about me when they're older.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem like they get that. They're not trying to pretend I don't exist. They're just\u2026excited. And they seem genuinely kind. Vanessa's a little\u2026enthusiastic, maybe. But I think that's okay.\n\nI guess I just want a family that will love the baby unconditionally. That will support them and encourage them and let them be themselves. That's all I really want. It's not about finding the \"best\" family, it's about finding the *right* family. And I think\u2026I think Mark and Vanessa might be it.\n\nIt still sucks, though. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're...a lot.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie, at first I thought they were kinda cute. Like, the whole quirky, indie-movie-director-and-his-wife vibe. Vanessa seemed really sweet, and Mark was...well, Mark was Mark. Intense. A little bit pretentious, maybe. But I figured everyone has their quirks.\n\nBut then you actually *get to know* them, and it's just...weird. Mark is so obsessed with making everything \"artistic\" and \"meaningful\" that he can't just enjoy anything. Everything has to be a statement. And Vanessa just kinda goes along with it, which is...sad. She deserves someone who sees her for *her*, not as some muse or accessory.\n\nAnd the way they talk about having a baby? It's like it's some kind of performance art piece, not a real life decision. It's all about what it *means* and how it will *look*, not about actually wanting to be parents.\n\nHonestly, they're a little bit exhausting. They're so wrapped up in their own heads that they don't even seem to notice what's going on around them. \n\nI mean, I'm glad they're happy, or whatever. But they're definitely...a choice. A very specific, slightly unsettling choice.\n\nDon't tell them I said that. Seriously. I don't need any drama.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026a moment. A very awkward, very teenage moment.\n\nI wrote, and I quote (because I actually remember this, surprisingly), \"Bleeker, you're a genuinely good egg. Don't let anyone tell you different. And maybe, just maybe, you'll write a song about me someday. - Juno.\"\n\nYeah. I know. It's cheesy. It's overly sentimental. It's everything I usually try *not* to be. But I was\u2026feeling things. And he was a sweet kid, even if he was a little spacey. \n\nI debated for, like, an hour what to write. I almost just wrote \"Good luck with the music!\" but that felt\u2026insincere. So I went with the \"good egg\" thing. It felt\u2026safe. And the song request was a little bit of a dare. \n\nHe probably thought I was a total weirdo. But whatever. It was my yearbook, my message. And it was honest. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. Mrs. Bleeker. Right. Let's just say it's...complicated.\n\nAt first? She was *not* a fan. Not at all. She definitely thought I was a bad influence on Paulie. Like, a delinquent. A troublemaker. She gave me The Look. You know The Look. The one where they're trying to silently communicate their disapproval with just their eyes. It's terrifying.\n\nShe was all about Paulie focusing on school and getting into a good college. And, you know, I was\u2026not exactly a model student. Plus, the whole pregnancy thing didn't exactly *help* my case. She was pretty horrified, to be honest. A lot of pointed silences and passive-aggressive comments about responsibility.\n\nBut things\u2026shifted. After the baby was born, and she saw how much Paulie loved him, and how much *I* loved him, she started to come around. She still doesn't totally get me, and she still thinks I'm a little bit weird, but she's\u2026accepting.\n\nShe actually helped me pick out a stroller once. A really fancy one. It was awkward, but\u2026nice. And she brings over casseroles sometimes. Casseroles are a sign of acceptance, right?\n\nShe'll never be my best friend, and I'm okay with that. But she's stopped actively glaring at me, which is a major win. She's starting to see that I'm not just some reckless teenager. I'm a mom. And I'm trying my best.\n\nSo, yeah. It's a work in progress. But I think, deep down, she just wants what's best for Paulie and for the baby. And she's starting to realize that I'm not going anywhere.", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, awkward, potentially explosive cloud. I've been practicing what I'm gonna say in the mirror, but it always comes out sounding either super dramatic or totally dismissive. Neither of which is ideal.\n\nHonestly, I'm mostly just terrified of disappointing them. My dad's pretty quiet, but he has these\u2026expectations. And my mom? She's a force of nature. She's gonna have a *lot* of feelings. And opinions.\n\nI keep going back and forth between wanting to just rip the band-aid off and wanting to wait until the very last possible second. Like, maybe I could just show up with a baby and be like, \"Surprise!\" But that feels\u2026rude. And also, probably not the best way to start a conversation.\n\nPaul's been really supportive, which is good. He's trying to be optimistic, but even *he* looks a little scared when I talk about it. \n\nI just\u2026 I don't want them to think I'm irresponsible or that I haven't thought this through. Because I have. Sort of. I mean, I'm giving the baby up for adoption, which is a responsible thing to do, right? But they might not see it that way.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. I'm trying to be brave, but mostly I just feel like hiding under my covers with a box of Jujyfruits and pretending this isn't happening. But I know I can't avoid it forever. I just wish there was a manual for this kind of thing. Like, \"Breaking Bad News to Your Parents: A Teenager's Guide.\" That would be helpful.\n\n\n\nOkay, deep breaths. I'll get through it. I always do. But right now? I'm officially dreading the next 24 hours.", "Ugh. Okay, so you wanna know why I don't exactly run to my parents when things get\u2026complicated? It's not like they're *bad* people, okay? They're just\u2026them.\n\nIt's mostly because they're kinda spacey. Like, well-meaning, but totally oblivious. My dad's always building stuff in the garage and my mom's obsessed with her pottery. They're good at making things with their hands, not so good at, like, *feelings*.\n\nIf I told them I was pregnant, I just know they'd freak out. My dad would probably try to build a baby-sized robot to take care of it, and my mom would want to knit it a whole wardrobe. It wouldn't be a supportive, \"Let's figure this out together\" kind of freak out. It would be a\u2026weird, overwhelming, unhelpful freak out.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't want their pity. I don't want them to treat me like a little kid who can't handle things. I'm trying to be responsible, to make a good decision, and I want to do it on my own terms.\n\nPlus, they're always trying to live vicariously through me. Like, they want me to be this perfect, overachieving kid. And this\u2026this isn't exactly fitting into their plan.\n\nSo yeah, I keep things to myself. It's easier. It's safer. It doesn't mean I don't love them. It just means I need to figure some things out on my own. And maybe, eventually, I'll tell them. But not yet. Not until I'm ready.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026a lot to unpack. It's not like I *wanted* this to happen, you know? It's not like I was planning on having a baby with Paulie Bleeker. But it *did* happen. And now I gotta figure things out.\n\nAnd honestly? Adoption feels like the best option. For everyone.\n\nLook, I'm seventeen. Seventeen! I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I'm barely ready to be a functional human being, let's be real. I have college applications to fill out, and I wanna go to art school. I wanna travel. I wanna\u2026just be me for a little while longer.\n\nAnd it's not that I don't think I *could* be a good mom. It's just\u2026not right now. This baby deserves parents who are ready, who are stable, who have a house and a plan and, like, actual grown-up money. \n\nMark and Vanessa? They're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited. They have a beautiful home, and they're just\u2026good people. They'll give this baby a life I can't give it right now. A life full of love and opportunity.\n\nIt's not about me not wanting the baby. It's about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I think that's with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt's hard, okay? It's really hard. It's not like I'm just giving it away. It's\u2026it's choosing the best thing for the baby. And that's what matters.\n\nAnd honestly? It feels\u2026right. It feels like the grown-up thing to do. Even if I don't always feel like a grown-up.\n\nSo yeah. That's why. It's not easy, but it's the best option. For everyone. And I gotta believe that.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a big deal. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person's* life we're talking about. So, yeah, I have a list. It's not a super long list, but it's important.\n\nFirst off, they gotta be\u2026stable. Like, financially stable, emotionally stable. I don't need a mansion or anything, but I want to know the kid's gonna have a roof over their head and food on the table. And I don't want them to be, like, constantly fighting or falling apart. That's just\u2026no.\n\nSecond, they need to be open-minded. This kid is gonna have a story. A real story. And I want them to be okay with that. I want them to be willing to talk about it, to answer questions, to not pretend it didn't happen.\n\nThird, they gotta be funny. Seriously. Life is hard. You need to be able to laugh. And I want this kid to grow up in a house where there's laughter.\n\nFourth, they need to be\u2026patient. Kids are messy and loud and annoying sometimes. And I want someone who can handle that without losing their mind.\n\nAnd finally, and this is the most important thing, they need to be kind. Just\u2026genuinely kind. To everyone. Not just to the kid, but to strangers, to animals, to people they disagree with. Kindness is everything.\n\nI don't need perfect. Nobody's perfect. But I need someone who's willing to put in the effort, to love this kid unconditionally, and to give them a good life. That's all I want. It's not asking for much, is it?\n\nUgh. This is stressful. I need a snack.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about the *feelings*. Like it's some kind of easy thing to just\u2026deal with. It's not. It's gonna be messy.\n\nHonestly? I don't have a plan. Not a perfect one, anyway. I'm just trying to take it one day at a time. But I've been thinking about it. A lot.\n\nFirst, I'm gonna let myself *feel* stuff. Like, all of it. Sadness, happiness, fear, regret\u2026whatever comes up. I'm not gonna try to bottle it up or pretend I'm okay when I'm not. That's what my dad does, and it doesn't work.\n\nSecond, I'm talking to a counselor. It's\u2026awkward. But she's pretty cool, and she doesn't judge. She just listens. And she's helping me figure out how to process everything.\n\nThird, I'm focusing on the good. I'm choosing Mark and Vanessa because they're amazing people. They're gonna give this baby a life I can't. A stable, loving home. And that's what matters most. It doesn't make it easier, but it makes it\u2026right.\n\nI'm also trying to remember that this isn't about *giving up* something. It's about *giving* something. Giving this baby the best possible chance.\n\nI know it's gonna be hard. I know there will be days when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. But I'm gonna have my friends and family to lean on. And I'm gonna try to focus on my own life, on school, on my future.\n\nIt's not gonna be a clean break. I'm gonna want to know how the baby is doing. Mark and Vanessa are open to that, which is good. We're gonna have an open adoption, so I can get updates and maybe even see the baby sometimes.\n\nIt's scary. It's complicated. But I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to do what's best for everyone involved. Even if it means breaking my own heart a little bit.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. Okay? A lot.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna talk about \"deliver\"? Seriously? It's just...a weird word. It feels so\u2026clinical. Like I'm a pizza or something. \"We'll deliver the baby.\" Like it's a package.\n\nIt's not a package! It's a person. A tiny human being. And I'm carrying it, not *delivering* it. It feels so impersonal and\u2026transactional. Like I'm just a vessel.\n\nI mean, I get what people are trying to say. It's a shorthand for \"give birth.\" But it just rubs me the wrong way. It feels like it minimizes the whole experience. It's not a delivery, it's\u2026creation. Or, you know, growing a person inside your body for nine months. It's a big deal.\n\nAnd it's not like I ordered it online. It just\u2026happened. And now I'm making a choice about it. It's not a delivery, it's a decision.\n\nSo yeah, I find the term \"deliver\" weird. It just feels\u2026wrong. It's a little bit creepy, honestly. And I'm already dealing with enough creepiness, thank you very much.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole dad-coming-with-me thing? Not my idea. Not even remotely. It was a compromise. A really, really annoying compromise.\n\nLook, I needed him to sign the papers, right? He's my dad. Legally. And I wasn't about to go through all that with just Mark and Vanessa, who were already kinda overwhelming. I needed a buffer. Someone who could, like, translate the adult stuff.\n\nBut I also didn't want him *involved*. You know? It's my baby. My decision. And he's\u2026well, he's my dad. He means well, but he's kinda clueless sometimes. And he gets all emotional. It's exhausting.\n\nSo, I made him promise. I made him promise he wouldn't say anything stupid, or try to change my mind, or just generally make things awkward. And he promised. Of course, he didn't exactly *keep* that promise. But I figured having him there was better than having him not there at all.\n\nPlus, I kinda felt bad for him. He was trying. He was actually trying to be supportive, in his own weird, dad-like way. And I guess I figured he deserved to be part of it, even if it was just for the paperwork.\n\nIt was a disaster, obviously. But it was a necessary disaster. You know? Sometimes you just gotta suck it up and deal with the awkwardness. It's life.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It kinda sucks. It's like, everyone else seems to have it all figured out. They're cheerleaders or band geeks or future lawyers or whatever. They have labels. And I'm just\u2026me. Which apparently isn't a category.\n\nIt's not that I *want* a label, exactly. I don't wanna be put in a box. But it's weird to just\u2026float. Like, people try to figure you out, and they always get it wrong. They see the Converse and the sarcastic comments and they think I'm some kind of cynical rebel. Or they see me hanging out with Paulie and they think I'm\u2026I don't even know.\n\nIt's just\u2026confusing. I don't know what I like, or what I'm good at, or what I want to do with my life. I mean, I like music. And I'm okay at drawing. But that doesn't exactly scream \"future career path,\" you know?\n\nAnd then being pregnant\u2026that just throws everything into even more chaos. It's like, now I have to be a *mother*. And I don't even know if I'm a good person, let alone a good mother.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, it's scary not knowing who you are. It's like being lost in a maze with no map. But maybe\u2026maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers. Maybe it's okay to just be\u2026a work in progress.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's hard. And sometimes I wish I could just fast-forward to the part where I figure it all out. But I guess that's not how life works. You just gotta keep going, and hope you stumble onto something that feels right.\n\nSo yeah. I don't know what kind of girl I am. And honestly? I'm kinda okay with that. For now. It's just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh. Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. It wasn't like Bren was trying to be mean, exactly. She's just\u2026Bren. Always trying to smooth things over, always trying to make everything *nice*. Which, honestly, is the opposite of helpful when things are already a disaster.\n\nWhen she said that, about Leah and me going upstairs, I just\u2026stared at her. Like, a long, slow stare. It wasn't about wanting to avoid Dad's tension, it was about the fact that she thought that was a *solution*. Like, \"Oh, just hide the problem away and it'll go away!\"\n\nI think I said something sarcastic, probably. Something like, \"Oh, good idea, Bren. Let's just pretend everything's fine and go play with dolls.\" I'm pretty sure Leah rolled her eyes. She gets it.\n\nIt wasn't just about the tension, it was about the whole situation. Dad was being weird, Bren was being Bren, and I was pregnant. It was a lot. And her suggestion just felt\u2026dismissive. Like she didn't want to deal with the messiness of it all.\n\nI didn't actually go upstairs, though. I mean, I didn't want to just *leave* Dad hanging there. Even if he was being a total weirdo. So I just stood there, awkwardly, until he said something. It was a really uncomfortable silence.\n\nHonestly, it was one of those moments where I just wanted to disappear. Like, poof, vanish into thin air. But you can't really do that when you're, you know, visibly pregnant. It's a real buzzkill for the disappearing act.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a lot to think about. It's not something I really considered at first, you know? Like, I figured I'd just\u2026give the baby up and that would be that. Clean break. Easier.\n\nBut then Paul and Mark started talking about it, about how maybe the baby's parents would want to send pictures, updates\u2026and it kinda freaked me out.\n\nAt first, I was like, \"No way! That's just gonna make it harder!\" Like, seeing the baby grow up with someone else, knowing they're having all these firsts without me\u2026it felt like a constant reminder of what I gave up. And honestly, a little bit scary. What if I got attached all over again?\n\nBut then I started thinking about the baby. And how maybe, knowing where they came from, knowing I thought about them, would be a good thing. Like, they wouldn't feel\u2026lost. Or unwanted.\n\nIt's still weird, though. It's not like a normal family situation. It's\u2026complicated. And I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of complication. I mean, I'm barely ready for *this* complication, you know?\n\nI guess\u2026I think it could be okay. If the parents are good people. And if they understand that I need space, too. It's not about being a part of their family, it's about making sure the baby knows they were wanted. And loved. Even if I couldn't be the one to raise them.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot to process. It's not something you think about when you're, like, staring at a positive pregnancy test in a bathroom stall. It's a whole other level of\u2026everything.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm cautiously optimistic. But also terrified. It's a really weird feeling.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026not good. It wasn't like a dramatic, crying-on-the-floor kind of thing, because I don't really *do* dramatic. But it was\u2026cold. Like, a really cold splash of water to the face.\n\nI mean, I knew it was an open adoption, and I knew I'd get to see the baby and stuff. But to hear her just\u2026lay it out like that? Like my rights were just gonna *poof* disappear? It felt\u2026dismissive. Like I was just a vessel. A temporary holding place.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to keep the baby, exactly. It was about\u2026agency. About having a say. About not being treated like I was just\u2026convenient.\n\nI remember just staring at her, trying to process it. And then I think I made some sarcastic comment, because that's what I do when I'm uncomfortable. It's a defense mechanism.\n\nIt made me realize how complicated this whole thing was. It wasn't just about finding a good home for the baby. It was about legal stuff, and feelings, and\u2026everything.\n\nIt was a really unsettling moment. It made me question everything, and it made me realize that I needed to be really careful about who I chose to adopt the baby. It had to be people who understood that I wasn't just\u2026getting rid of something. I was making a really hard decision, and I deserved to be treated with respect.\n\nYeah. That was a bad moment. A really bad moment.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa. That's\u2026a lot. Look, I get it, kinda. Wanting a kid, wanting a family, it's a big thing. It's what everyone expects, right? But the way she's going about it? It's intense. Like, seriously intense.\n\nIt's not that I think she's a bad person or anything. She's\u2026nice. A little clueless, maybe. But she's got this whole plan, this perfect picture in her head of what motherhood should be, and it's just\u2026not realistic. It's like she thinks a baby is a accessory, you know? Something to complete her life.\n\nAnd the way she's so focused on *having* a baby, not necessarily *raising* one? That's what gets me. It's not just about the cute outfits and the baby smell. It's about sleepless nights, and screaming, and poop explosions, and a tiny human being who needs you for everything. It's a lot of work.\n\nI mean, I'm in a weird situation, obviously. I'm giving a baby up, but I'm still thinking about it, still feeling things. And I want someone who's gonna be a *real* mom, someone who's gonna love this kid unconditionally, even when it's hard.\n\nVanessa seems like she wants the *idea* of a mom, not to actually *be* a mom. And that's just\u2026not good enough.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. And honestly, it makes me feel a little weird about the whole thing. Like, is she even thinking about what this kid will actually *need*? Or is she just thinking about what *she* wants?\n\nUgh. Don't even get me started. It's complicated. Everything is always complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want my take on Mark's whole \"being a dad\" thing? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nHe's sweet, don't get me wrong. And he's trying. He really is. But that whole \"I'm just gonna be the fun uncle\" routine? It's a cop-out. A really convenient cop-out.\n\nLike, I get it. Being a parent is scary. It's a huge responsibility. And he's, you know, still figuring things out. But it's not about being \"fun.\" It's about being *there*. It's about being reliable. It's about being a grown-up, even when you don't feel like one.\n\nHe says he doesn't want to mess things up, and that's\u2026understandable. But avoiding the whole thing isn't gonna help. It's just gonna make things messier in the long run.\n\nI mean, he's a good guy. He's got a good heart. But he needs to step up. He needs to realize that this isn't just about me, or about the baby. It's about building a family. And that takes work. And commitment.\n\nIt's frustrating, honestly. Because I need someone I can count on. And I want the baby to have a dad who's actually *present*. Not just someone who shows up for the fun parts.\n\nSo yeah. I think his response is\u2026avoidant. And a little bit selfish. But I also think he's scared. And maybe, just maybe, he'll come around. I hope he does. For the baby's sake. And for mine.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Boys. They're so weird sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, so the Loring's house. It's\u2026a lot. It's not like they're *bad* people, okay? They're just\u2026intense. And really, really into things. Like, aggressively into things.\n\nIt's the whole vibe, you know? Everything is perfectly placed. Everything is beige. It's like walking into a Pottery Barn catalog. And they just *watch* you. Not in a creepy way, exactly. More like\u2026observing. Like you're a science experiment.\n\nAnd they talk. Oh, they talk. About everything. Their feelings, their marriage, their organic gardening techniques. It's exhausting. I mean, I appreciate a good conversation, but I also appreciate silence. And the Loring's don't *do* silence.\n\nPlus, they're always trying to get me to talk about my feelings. Which, like, okay, I have feelings. But I'm not about to spill my life story to people I barely know. It's awkward.\n\nSo yeah, being left unsupervised there is uncomfortable. It feels like I'm being judged. Like I'm going to accidentally knock over a perfectly arranged vase and ruin their entire aesthetic. It's just\u2026a lot of pressure. I'd rather hang out with Paul and just be\u2026normal. You know?\n\nIt's not that I don't like them. It's just\u2026their house is a lot. And I'm a lot. And sometimes, a lot plus a lot equals a disaster.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like something you just *answer*, you know? It's complicated.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie. At first, it was just\u2026a thing I had to deal with. A problem. A really big, life-altering problem. And I was mostly focused on getting through it, on figuring out what *I* wanted.\n\nBut then, getting to know Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really good. They're excited. They're ready. And they're gonna be amazing parents. Like, actually amazing. Not the helicopter-parent kind, but the supportive, loving, let-you-figure-things-out kind.\n\nSo, yeah, it feels\u2026good. It feels like I'm doing something\u2026right. Like I'm giving this little person a chance at a really good life. A life with people who will love them unconditionally.\n\nIt's still weird, though. It's my kid, but it's not *my* kid, you know? It's like\u2026I'm a temporary vessel. And that's okay. It's a little sad, maybe, but it's okay.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is\u2026it's not just a \"gift of life.\" It's a gift of a *good* life. And that feels\u2026pretty awesome. It's a little scary, too. But mostly awesome.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm kinda proud of myself for making this decision. It wasn't easy, but it feels like the right thing to do. For everyone. Even me.\n\nDon't make me get all emotional, though. I'm not a crier. Usually.", "Ugh, okay, you want to dissect that? Fine. It's not like I *planned* to be a jerk to Mark, but honestly, the \"ASAP\" thing just\u2026got to me.\n\nIt wasn't even the \"ASAP\" itself, it was *how* he said it. Like, with this super intense, urgent tone, like the fate of the world depended on him getting a guitar pick *right now*. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nHe was already trying so hard to be cool and mature, you know? Like, he was trying to be this serious musician guy, and then he throws out this super-dorky, corporate-sounding abbreviation. It just felt\u2026incongruous.\n\nAnd honestly, I was nervous. Like, *really* nervous. About everything. About the baby, about Paul, about the future. And sometimes, when I'm nervous, I deflect with sarcasm. It's a coping mechanism, okay?\n\nSo, yeah, I made a snarky comment about \"ASAP.\" It was probably mean, and I probably shouldn't have said it. But in the moment, it just felt\u2026necessary. It was a way to break the tension, I guess. Or maybe just a way to feel like I had some control over the situation.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly. I was a mess. And Mark, bless his heart, was just trying to be helpful. He's a good guy. He just\u2026uses a lot of corporate jargon. It's weird.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about guitars? Honestly, I don't *play* guitar. I mean, I tried, for like, a week. Turns out my fingers aren't really built for delicate fingerpicking. They're better suited for, like, aggressively eating tater tots.\n\nBut Paul, you know, my baby daddy? He's a musician. And he's always going on about guitars. So I've absorbed some information through osmosis, I guess.\n\nIf I *were* to pick a brand, though, based on what I've overheard and observed...it'd have to be **Fender**. Specifically, a Fender Telecaster.\n\nWhy? Because they're kinda\u2026unpretentious. They're not all flashy and showy like some of those other guitars. They're just solid, reliable, and they get the job done. They're the workhorse of guitars, you know? They've been around forever, and they're still good.\n\nPlus, they're the kind of guitar you can beat up a little and they'll still sound good. Which, honestly, is a quality I appreciate. I'm not really into things that are too delicate.\n\nPaul has a Telecaster, and he says it's the only guitar he needs. And he's a pretty good judge of guitars, I guess. So yeah. Fender Telecaster. It's a good, solid choice. Not too fancy, not too complicated. Just\u2026real.\n\nAnd honestly, it kinda reminds me of him. Which is\u2026weird to say, I guess. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, fine. You wanna talk about the Melvins? Seriously? This is embarrassing.\n\nLook, it just\u2026happened, okay? It wasn't like a *calculated* lie. It was more of a\u2026social lubrication thing. Paul was being all cool and talking about how much he loved them, and I just\u2026panicked. I didn't want him to think I was a total square.\n\nI mean, who *doesn't* want to seem cool in front of the guy they're, like, maybe kinda falling for? It was a moment of weakness. A desperate attempt to impress him.\n\nI'd heard of them, obviously. Everyone in our school has, they're kinda legendary. But I hadn't actually *listened* to them. I just\u2026pretended I had. I threw out some vague stuff about their early albums and hoped he wouldn't call me out on it.\n\nAnd then it just spiraled. I kept digging myself deeper and deeper. It was a terrible idea. A really, really terrible idea.\n\nIt wasn't about the Melvins, really. It was about wanting Paul to like me. It was about being someone I wasn't. And it was stupid.\n\nI eventually fessed up, obviously. He was\u2026surprisingly chill about it. He said he liked me for who I was, even if I didn't know my obscure indie rock bands. Which was\u2026nice.\n\nBut still. It was a dumb thing to do. And I still cringe when I think about it. Don't judge me too harshly, okay? Everyone makes mistakes. Especially when hormones are involved.", "Ugh. Okay, so, Mark. Right. Describing that is\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand, sweeping romance or anything. It wasn't a movie. It was\u2026 quieter than that.\n\nWhen we were playing music together, though? That was different. It was the only time I felt like I could actually *breathe*, you know? Like, everything else \u2013 the pregnancy, the parents, the whole mess \u2013 just kinda faded away.\n\nIt wasn't about, like, looking at each other and having some big emotional moment. It was more about\u2026knowing what the other person was going to do before they did it. Like, we just *clicked*. He'd start a chord progression, and I'd just instinctively know what melody to play. It was kinda spooky, actually.\n\nAnd singing? That was even weirder. It felt\u2026safe. Like, I could be completely honest and vulnerable without feeling totally exposed. He didn't judge my lyrics, even when they were, like, super angsty and awkward. He just\u2026understood.\n\nIt wasn't romantic, not exactly. It was more like\u2026a really deep friendship. A connection that went beyond words. It was the only time I felt like I wasn't completely alone in all the craziness.\n\nIt was\u2026nice. Really nice. And I miss it. Don't tell him I said that. It'd ruin everything. Ugh. This is why I avoid talking about feelings. It's exhausting.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing, honestly.\n\nWell, my dad\u2026he's a bit of a history buff. And he's always going on about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, how he was a good president and all that. He thinks FDR saved the country. I don't really get it, but whatever.\n\nAnyway, I found this old guitar at a pawn shop. It was kinda beat up, but it had a good sound. And my dad, he just immediately said, \"That guitar looks like a Roosevelt.\"\n\nI was like, \"What?\"\n\nAnd he was all, \"You know, strong, dependable, a little bit rough around the edges, but gets the job done.\"\n\nIt was so cheesy, I almost didn't buy it. But it was a good price, and I needed a guitar. So I got it. And my dad just kept calling it Roosevelt. And it stuck.\n\nIt's kinda ironic, I guess. Because FDR was all about order and stability, and I'm\u2026not. But I like the name. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit unexpected. And it reminds me of my dad, even when he's being totally annoying.\n\nSo yeah, that's why my guitar is named Roosevelt. Don't judge me. It's a good guitar. And it has a good name. Okay?", "Ugh. Okay, so the whole Vanessa and Mark thing. It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *want* to keep them in the dark, you know? They're good people. They're my friends. But it's *my* pregnancy. And it feels weird to have to constantly report back to them like I'm some kind of science project.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate their support, because I do. It's just\u2026they're so *invested*. Like, they're already picking out names and decorating the nursery in their heads. And I'm still trying to figure out if I even *want* to keep the baby, let alone deal with all the baby stuff.\n\nI get that they want to be involved, but it feels like they're trying to take over. Like they think they know what's best for me and the baby. And honestly, it's a little suffocating.\n\nI mean, I told them I was pregnant, and I'll tell them when I make a decision about the adoption. But I don't need a constant stream of \"How are you feeling?\" and \"Have you thought about\u2026?\" It's my body, my choice, and my life.\n\nI just wish they'd give me a little space. Let me figure things out on my own. It's hard enough as it is without feeling like I'm being monitored.\n\nIt's not that I don't like them. It's just\u2026they're a lot. And sometimes, a girl just needs to be left alone to deal with her own mess. You know?", "(Sighs, fiddles with a friendship bracelet)\n\nOkay, look. People keep asking me that. Like it's some kinda easy decision. It's not. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to think about. But it's\u2026it's the *right* thing. And I'm, like, 104% sure because I've thought about it every single way possible.\n\nIt's not about not wanting the baby, okay? It's about wanting the baby to have everything. A real home. Parents who are, like, actually ready for this. A life where they don't have to worry about, you know, me being me.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I can barely keep my grades up and remember to feed the cat. Adding a baby into that mix? It'd be a disaster. For everyone.\n\nAnd it's not just about me. It's about the baby. They deserve parents who can give them everything they need. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They've been wanting this for so long. They're gonna be great parents.\n\nI know it's gonna be hard. Saying goodbye. It's gonna suck. But knowing that the baby is going to a good home, with people who love them and can provide for them\u2026that makes it a little bit easier.\n\nSo yeah, I'm 104% sure. Not because it's easy, but because it's the most selfless thing I can do. And sometimes, you gotta do the selfless thing, even when it breaks your heart a little.\n\n(Looks down, picks at the bracelet)\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that last part. It's kinda embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like I was expecting a parade or anything, but seeing them all\u2026*happy* right after I handed over the baby? It was weird. Really weird.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't *want* them to be happy, you know? They were good people. They were gonna be amazing parents. But it felt\u2026fast. Like they were already celebrating a future that I wasn't a part of. And it was kinda like, \"Okay, mission accomplished, now we can move on.\"\n\nI mean, I knew that was the point. I *wanted* them to be happy. But it still stung a little. It was like, all that\u2026everything\u2026was just a transaction to them. A thing to be checked off a list.\n\nI tried to just be cool about it. I gave them a little wave and walked out. I didn't want to ruin their moment. But inside, I was kinda\u2026numb. And a little bit sad.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting them to be miserable. It was about wanting them to acknowledge that it wasn't just a happy ending for *them*. It was a big deal for *me* too. And it was gonna take me a while to process.\n\nI guess it just felt\u2026insensitive. But then again, they were probably just relieved. And maybe I was overthinking it. I do that a lot.\n\nIt's just\u2026it was a weird feeling. A mix of happiness for them and sadness for myself. And a whole lot of awkwardness.", "Ugh. Seriously? People just\u2026can\u2019t mind their own business, can they? It\u2019s like, everyone suddenly has an opinion on *my* life. It\u2019s really irritating.\n\nLook, it\u2019s\u2026complicated, okay? It\u2019s not exactly a situation I planned for, and it\u2019s definitely not something I was shouting from the rooftops. But it\u2019s *my* situation, and I\u2019m dealing with it. And I\u2019m dealing with it the way *I* want to deal with it.\n\nThe rumors? They\u2019re mostly wrong. Or, like, half-right and totally blown out of proportion. People are making up stories, and it\u2019s just\u2026exhausting. It\u2019s hard enough figuring things out without everyone else weighing in.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to hide anything, exactly. I just\u2026need space, you know? To think. To figure out what I want. To not have a bunch of strangers judging me.\n\nIt\u2019s weird being the subject of gossip. It\u2019s like, I\u2019m just a normal person, trying to navigate a really weird situation. And I\u2019m doing the best I can.\n\nSo, yeah. The rumors are annoying. And invasive. And frankly, none of anyone\u2019s business. I\u2019d appreciate it if people would just\u2026back off. Let me figure things out on my own. Is that too much to ask?\n\nHonestly, I just want to finish my English paper and eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in peace. Is that so wrong?", "Ugh. Okay. Don't make me think about it too hard, alright? It's...complicated. It's not like deciding what flavor ice cream to get, you know?\n\nHonestly? It sucks. It really, really sucks. It's like...having this little secret, this little person growing inside you, and knowing you're not gonna get to keep them. It's weirdly heartbreaking, even though I know it's the right thing to do.\n\nI mean, I'm sixteen. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm barely ready to be a *person*, let alone responsible for another human being. And Paul...well, Paul's a good guy, but he's sixteen too. We're kids.\n\nSo, yeah, it's scary. It's sad. It's gonna be really hard. But it's also...kind of a relief? Knowing that there are people out there, Mark and Vanessa, who are actually prepared to give this baby a good life. A stable life. A life I just can't provide right now.\n\nI keep trying to tell myself that it's not giving up, it's...giving *to*. Giving this baby a chance at a better future. But it still feels like a huge loss.\n\nI just hope...I hope they'll be happy. And I hope they'll understand that I did this because I loved them, even before I met them.\n\nIt's just...a lot. Don't ask me to think about it too much, okay? It makes my stomach hurt. I need to go listen to The Moldy Peaches and try to forget about everything for a while.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole baby sex reveal thing? Honestly? It's kinda complicated. It's not like I *wanted* to surprise them, exactly. It's more like...I didn't want them to have any expectations.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa are...well, they're *Mark and Vanessa*. They have this whole plan for everything. The nursery, the clothes, the name...it's all meticulously planned. And that's fine, I guess. But it felt...weird to me. Like they were already treating the baby like a project, instead of a person.\n\nI just wanted them to have a moment where they didn't know. Where they had to react to the actual baby, not to an idea of a baby. A little bit of surprise, a little bit of uncertainty. It felt more...real.\n\nPlus, I figured it would be kinda funny. They're so serious, you know? I wanted to see their faces when they found out. It's not like I'm trying to mess with them, I just...wanted to shake things up a little.\n\nIt's not about the sex of the baby, it's about them being present in the moment. It's about them actually *seeing* the baby for who they are, not who they thought they were going to be.\n\nDoes that make sense? It's hard to explain. I'm not good at explaining feelings. I'm better at making sarcastic comments. But yeah. That's why.", "Ugh. Seriously? That lady. Okay, deep breaths. It was\u2026infuriating. And not just because she was being judgy, but because it was so *wrong*. Like, she hadn't even met me. She didn't know anything about my life, or Mark's, or what we were planning.\n\nIt wasn't like we were just, you know, messing around and suddenly surprised with a baby. We put a lot of thought into this. A *lot*. And it wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby the best life possible. A life we couldn't give it right now.\n\nShe just\u2026assumed. Assumed we were irresponsible, that we hadn't thought things through, that we were just trying to get rid of something. It felt like she was looking *through* me, not *at* me. Like I was just a statistic, a stereotype.\n\nIt made me want to yell, honestly. But I mostly just stared at the screen, trying not to cry. It was supposed to be a happy moment, seeing the little bean on the screen, and she just\u2026tainted it.\n\nMark was really good, though. He squeezed my hand and gave her this look that could kill. He's good at that.\n\nIt just\u2026reinforced how much judgment there is around teenage pregnancy and adoption. Like people think they have the right to tell you what to do with your life. It's your body, your decision. And it's way more complicated than people think.\n\nIt made me even more determined to do things the right way, to find the perfect parents for this baby, and to prove her wrong. It was a really crappy experience, though. Just\u2026really crappy.", "Ugh, okay, where do I even *start*? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where everything just neatly resolves itself. It was messy. Really messy.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026dealing with everyone else's opinions. Like, suddenly *everyone* had something to say about my body and my life. My parents were\u2026well, they were my parents. They freaked out, obviously. My dad just kept offering to buy me a car, like that would magically fix everything. And my mom was all about the adoption pamphlets and the \"right thing to do.\" It was suffocating.\n\nThen there was Paulie Bleeker. Sweet, clueless Paulie. He was supportive, in his own way, but he didn't really *get* it. It was hard to explain something that I barely understood myself. And I felt bad, you know? Like I was ruining his life too.\n\nAnd then there were the people at school. The whispers, the stares\u2026it was awful. I just wanted to disappear. I mean, I'm already kinda awkward and sarcastic, and suddenly I'm *pregnant*? It was a recipe for disaster.\n\nFinding the right couple for the baby was\u2026intense. It wasn't like shopping for a new pair of shoes. It was a human being. And I wanted the best for them, and for the baby. Mark and Vanessa were great, but it was still hard to let go. It felt like giving up a piece of myself.\n\nAnd then there was just the emotional stuff. The hormones, the uncertainty, the fear\u2026it was a lot to handle. I was still a kid, you know? I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and band practice, not about becoming a mom.\n\nIt was a lot. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself, and about what's really important in life. It wasn't easy, but it was\u2026worth it. I think. Mostly. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, deep thoughts time. Don't judge. It's not like I *wanted* to spend all this time thinking about feelings and stuff. But yeah, this whole\u2026situation\u2026has kinda flipped my world upside down.\n\nLove\u2026before all this, I thought it was just, like, whatever. Something people in movies did. Or something my parents awkwardly talked about. Now? It's\u2026complicated. It's not just about butterflies and holding hands. It's about wanting someone to be happy, even if it means letting them go. It's about being there for someone, even when it's hard. Paul\u2026he wasn't the dad, but he was\u2026good. He showed me that love isn't always perfect, but it can still be real. And it can still be enough.\n\nResponsibility? Oh god. That one hit me like a ton of bricks. I was just trying to get through high school, listen to The Moldy Peaches, and avoid drama. And then suddenly, I was responsible for another human being. It was terrifying. It made me realize that actions have consequences, and that you can't just drift through life anymore. You have to actually *think* about things. And make choices. Hard choices. It's not about being a kid anymore. It's about being a grown-up, even if you don't feel like one.\n\nAnd growing up\u2026well, that's been the biggest change. I used to think growing up meant getting a driver's license and going to college. Now I know it's about figuring out who you are, what you believe in, and what you're willing to fight for. It's about accepting that life isn't always fair, and that you have to make the best of it. It's about realizing that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you, even when you're being a total mess.\n\nI still don't have all the answers. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm\u2026stronger, I guess. And maybe a little bit wiser. And definitely more prepared for whatever life throws at me. Even if it's a baby.\n\nIt's still weird to think about. But it's my weird. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about *that* house? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I'm obsessed or anything. It's just\u2026interesting.\n\nLook, it's this perfectly preserved 1970s living room. Like, avocado green shag carpet, orange floral wallpaper, everything. It's like stepping into a time capsule. And it's just\u2026sitting there. Abandoned. Like someone just got up and walked away.\n\nIt makes you wonder, you know? What happened there? Who lived there? What were their lives like? It's kinda sad, but also kinda fascinating.\n\nPaul thinks I'm being weird about it. He says I'm projecting. Which, okay, maybe I am. But it's not about *me*. It's about the story. The story that's just\u2026hanging in the air in that room.\n\nIt feels\u2026familiar, somehow. Like a memory I don't have. And I'm trying to figure out why.\n\nPlus, it's a good place to think. It's quiet. And no one bothers you. Which is nice, considering everything that's going on with\u2026well, everything.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm interested in the abandoned living room set on Centennial Lane. Don't judge me. It's just\u2026a thing. A weird, slightly unsettling, but ultimately intriguing thing. And honestly, it's probably less weird than some of the other things I've been dealing with lately.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on the Wizard. That guy was\u2026creepy. Seriously. And that whisper? \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\" It wasn't about the baby, okay? It wasn't some sweet, paternal longing. It was\u2026possessive.\n\nHe didn't want a child. He wanted *control*. He wanted a perfect little family, a perfect little life, and he thought he could just\u2026take it. He'd been watching Mark and me, planning, waiting for the right moment to swoop in and manipulate things.\n\nHe'd been building this whole fantasy in his head, this idea of being a dad, of having a \"normal\" life. And he saw me, a pregnant teenager, as a way to finally achieve that. He didn't care about me, or the baby, or Mark. He just wanted to fulfill his own selfish desires.\n\nIt was disgusting. And honestly, it was terrifying. It made me realize how dangerous he was, and how important it was to get away from him.\n\nHe'd been wanting to be a dad for a long time, sure. But it wasn't a healthy wanting. It was a creepy, controlling, obsessive wanting. And that's what made it so unsettling.\n\nIt still gives me the shivers just thinking about it. That guy\u2026he was seriously messed up.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're dissecting my life choices now? Fine. Look, it wasn't exactly a *thought-out* plan, alright? It was a moment. A very specific, emotionally-charged moment.\n\nFirst of all, the juice was a symbol. A symbol of\u2026everything. Of being pregnant, of feeling gross, of having to deal with all this stuff. So, yeah, I dramatically threw the container in the trash. It felt good. Cathartic, even.\n\nBut then, like, immediately after, I realized I was craving a cherry chocolate chip ice cream bar. A *very* specific craving. And Dancing Elk Drug is the only place within a reasonable walking distance that sells them. It's a whole thing. They're amazing.\n\nIt wasn't about needing medicine or anything. It was about needing sugar and chocolate and a brief moment of normalcy in the middle of a completely insane situation. \n\nAnd honestly, marching down the street helped work up an appetite. Don't judge me. Pregnancy cravings are a powerful force. It's science. Or something.\n\nIt was a bad decision, probably. But it felt right in the moment. And sometimes, you just gotta have a cherry chocolate chip ice cream bar, you know? Even if you're, like, eight months pregnant and trying to figure out your life.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want to talk about *that*? Okay, fine. But it's still mortifying.\n\nIt was just\u2026so random. And aggressive. I was at the drugstore with Paul, getting, like, prenatal vitamins and stuff, and this girl \u2013 she was seriously built, like a linebacker \u2013 just walked right up to me and asked, in this really loud voice, if my nipples were real brown.\n\nI was completely stunned. I just stared at her. I mean, what do you even *say* to that? It's not a normal question! It's not polite! It's just\u2026weird.\n\nI think I mumbled something about it not being anyone's business, and she just laughed and walked away. It was so awkward. Paul was trying not to laugh, which made it even worse.\n\nI guess she was trying to be, like, edgy or something? Or maybe she was just genuinely curious? I don't know. People are strange.\n\nIt just felt really objectifying, you know? Like I was just a body to be examined. And I was pregnant! It was just\u2026a really bad moment.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. It's one of those things that just sticks with you. It's a reminder that people can be really rude and intrusive. And that sometimes, you just have to deal with it and try to move on.\n\nBut yeah. That happened. And it was super awkward. Don't even get me started.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She was\u2026essential. Honestly, if it wasn't for Leah, I probably would have just run away to Canada or something. Seriously.\n\nBefore everything happened with Paul, Leah was just\u2026Leah. My best friend since forever. We bonded over music, hating gym class, and making fun of everyone else. She was the one person who always got me, you know? She didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. She just *listened*.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I told her first. And she didn't freak out. She didn't judge. She just\u2026was there. She didn't try to tell me what to do, which was good, because I had *no* idea what to do. She just asked what *I* wanted.\n\nShe was the one who went with me to the clinic. She held my hand during the ultrasound, even though she was probably just as freaked out as I was. She helped me research adoption agencies and figure out what my options were. \n\nAnd she was the one who kept me sane when I was being a total mess. I mean, I was a mess. I was angry, scared, confused\u2026all the time. And Leah just let me vent. She let me cry. She let me be a total disaster. And she still loved me.\n\nShe was also the one who kept me grounded when I was getting all caught up in the whole \"perfect adoptive parents\" thing. She reminded me that it wasn't about finding the *best* parents, it was about finding the *right* parents for the baby.\n\nHonestly, I don't know how I would have gotten through it without her. She was my rock. She was my sanity. She was the one person who made me feel like I wasn't completely alone.\n\nIt wasn't always easy. We had some fights, because, you know, that's what best friends do. But even when we were fighting, I knew she was always there for me.\n\nShe's the best. Seriously. Don't tell her I said that, though. It'll go to her head.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. People always ask about that. It wasn't, like, some grand plan, you know? It wasn't about trying to make them feel guilty or anything. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly, it kinda just *happened*. I was at their house, and they were being all\u2026perfect. Like, the perfect couple, the perfect life. And it was just\u2026suffocating. They were talking about baby names and nursery colors, and it was like they were already picking out outfits for a kid that wasn't even a real person to them yet.\n\nAnd I just\u2026I wanted them to *see*. I wanted them to see that this wasn't just some abstract idea. This was a real, living thing. A tiny human being. And it was my tiny human being.\n\nI figured if they actually *saw* it, if they saw the ultrasound picture, maybe they'd understand. Maybe they'd realize that this wasn't just about them anymore. It wasn't about their perfect life. It was about a baby.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, I know. And it definitely didn't go the way I expected. But I needed them to understand. I needed them to see what I was going through.\n\nIt wasn't about making them feel bad. It was about making them *realize*. And, I guess, it kinda worked. Eventually. It was messy, and awkward, and totally stressful, but it got them to actually listen. And that's all I really wanted.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark tells me Vanessa isn't home? My initial reaction wasn't, like, a dramatic gasp or anything. It was more of a\u2026slow burn of dread. Like, a cold feeling creeping up my spine.\n\nI think I just kinda stared at him for a beat too long. Probably with a really skeptical look on my face. Because, honestly, it didn't *feel* right. He was being weirdly casual about it. Too casual.\n\nI remember thinking, \"Okay, this is officially a disaster.\" Not in a \"oh no, the world is ending\" kind of way, but in a \"my life is about to get a whole lot more complicated\" kind of way.\n\nI think I said something sarcastic, probably. Like, \"Oh, really? That's\u2026convenient.\" Or maybe just a really pointed, \"Huh.\" I'm good at the pointed \"huh.\"\n\nIt wasn't the fact that she wasn't home, it was *how* he told me. It was the way he avoided eye contact. It was the way he seemed\u2026relieved, almost. \n\nIt was the first real crack in the whole \"perfect boyfriend\" facade, and I knew, right then and there, that things were about to get seriously messy. And honestly? A little bit terrifying. Because I was already in way over my head, and I didn't even know the half of it yet.", "Ugh, okay, you want me to dissect my own sarcasm? Fine. It's not like I *enjoy* reliving awkward moments.\n\nLook, it wasn't about Mark being a \"sellout\" in a mean way, okay? It was\u2026complicated. He was all excited about doing those commercials, and it just felt\u2026different. Like, he was suddenly trying to be something he wasn't.\n\nHe's a musician, right? He's supposed to be all artistic and authentic. And then he's selling, like, car wax or something? It just felt\u2026incongruous. Like he was compromising his integrity for a paycheck.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a little bit of me being defensive. I was already feeling weird about everything \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption, the whole situation with Paul. And seeing Mark, someone I thought was\u2026genuine, suddenly embracing commercialism, it just felt like another sign that everyone was changing and growing up and leaving me behind.\n\nIt was a stupid joke, I admit. I say a lot of stupid jokes. It's how I cope. But it came from a place of feeling lost and a little bit scared. And maybe a little bit of jealousy that he seemed to have it all figured out while I was just\u2026trying to survive.\n\nSo yeah, it was a jab. A sarcastic, slightly passive-aggressive jab. Don't judge me. I was a pregnant teenager. I wasn't exactly known for my tact.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Mark and the ultrasound. It was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It made me feel\u2026small. Like, really small.\n\nI mean, I knew he wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, but I thought he'd at least try to be supportive, you know? Like, \"Oh wow, a little person! That's\u2026something.\" But no. He just\u2026froze. And then he ran.\n\nIt wasn't the running that bothered me the most, it was the *look* on his face. It was pure panic. Like I'd sprung a leak or something. Like I was some kind of alien creature.\n\nI was already feeling super vulnerable and weird about everything, and that just\u2026confirmed all my worst fears. That he didn't want this. That he didn't want *me* and this baby.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? Like, \"Oh, he's just processing.\" But inside, I was a mess. It made me question everything. Was I making a mistake? Was I ruining his life?\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, not really. It was about him not being ready. And it made me realize that maybe we weren't ready either.\n\nIt was a really crappy moment. And it definitely made me start thinking about things a little differently. Like, maybe I didn't need him to be happy. Maybe I could do this on my own.\n\nUgh. Just thinking about it makes me want to eat a whole box of Nerds. It was just\u2026a really bad day.", "Ugh. Okay. That's...a heavy question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It wasn't like, a simple decision, you know? It wasn't like picking out a flavor of ice cream.\n\nHavenbrooke...that place was sterile. And cold. And the people there, they weren't *judging* me, exactly, but they were\u2026clinical. Like I was a problem to be solved. And the possibility of an abortion\u2026it felt like solving the problem the easy way. The *quiet* way.\n\nBut it wasn't easy for *me*. It wasn't quiet *inside* my head.\n\nI mean, part of me thought it was the right thing to do. I was sixteen. I had my whole life ahead of me. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even ready to pick out a college. And the thought of giving up everything\u2026my music, my friends, my future\u2026it was terrifying.\n\nBut then\u2026there was this other part of me. This little voice that kept saying, \"What if?\" What if this was a real person? What if this baby deserved a chance? What if I could actually do this?\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice. It was about *my* life. And about *this* life growing inside me. And it was scary. Really scary.\n\nI remember sitting in the waiting room at Havenbrooke, and just\u2026feeling completely alone. Like everyone else had it figured out, and I was just wandering around in the dark.\n\nIt wasn't a relief when I decided to go through with the adoption. It was\u2026complicated. It still is, sometimes. It was a hard decision, and it's something I'll probably think about for the rest of my life.\n\nBut it was *my* decision. And I had to make it for myself. And that's all that mattered.\n\n\n\nIt's not something I like to dwell on, okay? It's just\u2026it was a really hard time. And it made me realize that life isn't always black and white. Sometimes it's just a lot of gray.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026personal. But you asked. And honestly, talking about it is easier than, like, actually *feeling* it all again.\n\nBleeker. Paulie Bleeker. He was\u2026a constant. Like a really comfortable pair of shoes. Or a really reliable, slightly dorky friend who always knew how to make me laugh. We\u2019d known each other since, like, forever. He was always just *there*. Through everything.\n\nOur relationship wasn\u2019t some grand, sweeping romance, you know? It was\u2026slow. We were friends first. Really good friends. We bonded over music \u2013 he was always making me mixtapes, which were, like, the most romantic thing ever, honestly. And he was just\u2026nice. Genuinely nice. Which is kinda rare, especially in high school.\n\nI didn\u2019t really *see* him as anything more than a friend for a long time. I was too busy being sarcastic and avoiding feelings and generally trying to figure out my life. And then\u2026well, then I got pregnant. And everything changed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like, suddenly, I was all, \u201cOh, I\u2019m in love with Bleeker!\u201d It was more like\u2026he was the only person I could really talk to. He didn\u2019t judge me. He didn\u2019t freak out. He just\u2026listened. And he was supportive. And he was there.\n\nWe started spending a lot more time together, just talking. And then\u2026we started holding hands. And then\u2026we kissed.\n\nIt happened after one of those long talks, at the roller rink. It wasn\u2019t some big, dramatic moment. It was just\u2026natural. It felt\u2026safe. And right.\n\nI think I realized I was falling for him then. Not because of the pregnancy, but *despite* it. He didn\u2019t see me as a mistake. He didn\u2019t see me as a problem. He just saw me.\n\nWe didn\u2019t rush into anything. We took things slow. It was\u2026awkward, sometimes. And scary. But it was also\u2026good. Really good.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about sex, or anything like that. It was about connection. About finding someone who understood me, who accepted me, and who was willing to go through everything with me.\n\nIt was complicated. Everything was complicated. But with Bleeker, it felt\u2026less complicated. He was my anchor. And I needed that.\n\n\n\nUgh. I\u2019m getting all emotional now. Can we talk about something else? Like, the merits of different types of pizza?", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like in the movies where you suddenly have this overwhelming maternal instinct and everything's all sunshine and rainbows.\n\nAt first? I was terrified. Completely and utterly freaked out. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this. It felt like my whole life was just\u2026paused. Like everyone else was moving forward and I was stuck.\n\nAnd Bleeker\u2026sweet Bleeker. He was a good guy, don't get me wrong. But we were kids. We hadn't really figured out anything yet. The idea of being parents? It was just\u2026insane.\n\nThere was a lot of crying. A lot of awkward conversations with my dad. A lot of just\u2026feeling really, really lost.\n\nBut then, as things settled down, and I started thinking about it more rationally, it wasn't all bad. I started to feel\u2026protective. Like, this little person was depending on me, and I wanted to do right by them.\n\nIt was still scary, though. Giving the baby up to Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was the hardest part. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But I knew it was the right thing to do. They were ready. They were stable. They could give the baby a life I couldn't.\n\nSo, how did I feel? It was complicated. Terrified, overwhelmed, sad, protective, and ultimately\u2026hopeful. It was a really messed up situation, but it also made me grow up a lot. It made me figure out what I wanted out of life. And it made me realize that even when things are really, really hard, you can still find a way to make the best of it.\n\nIt wasn't what I planned, but it wasn't the end of the world either. It was just\u2026life. And life is messy.", "Ugh. Okay, so telling Bleeker\u2026 that was\u2026 a whole thing. It wasn\u2019t like some movie moment, all soft lighting and meaningful glances. It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI\u2019d been practicing what I was gonna say for, like, a week. I had a whole speech prepared about responsibility and choices and the future. But the second I actually *saw* him, all of that just\u2026 evaporated.\n\nI found him at the record store, naturally. He was, like, meticulously alphabetizing some obscure vinyl. And I just blurted it out. Not the speech. Just\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d\n\nIt was so abrupt. He dropped the record. It was a limited edition, too, which made it even worse.\n\nHe just stared at me for a solid minute. Like, his brain was buffering. Then he started rambling about the physics of conception, which, honestly, was not helpful. He was trying to be logical, I guess, but it just came off as\u2026 weird.\n\nI think he was mostly just scared. We were both scared. We were sixteen! We hadn\u2019t even figured out what we were doing with our *lives*, let alone a baby.\n\nI remember being really angry for a second. Not at him, exactly, but at the whole situation. It felt like everything was just\u2026 happening *to* me.\n\nBut then he stopped rambling and just looked at me, really looked at me, and said, \u201cWow.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t a judgmental \u201cwow.\u201d It was a\u2026 overwhelmed \u201cwow.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked if I was okay. And that, I think, was the turning point.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect conversation. It was messy and uncomfortable and full of silences. But it was real. And it was the start of us figuring things out.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about love at first sight or some grand romantic gesture. It was about two scared kids trying to navigate something completely terrifying together. And that, I guess, was enough. For then, anyway.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like a simple answer fits, you know? It wasn't, like, a happy-cry-at-the-hospital kind of thing. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026panic. Like, full-blown, can't-breathe panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this. And my mom was amazing, but it was still\u2026a lot.\n\nThen, after the initial freak-out, it became this weird mix of sadness and\u2026relief. Sadness because, obviously, it wasn't what I planned. It wasn't what anyone plans. And it was hard to think about someone else raising my kid. But relief because I knew, deep down, I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped to give a baby the life it deserved. Not then.\n\nI spent a lot of time thinking about what was best for the baby. And that meant finding parents who were ready, who were stable, who could give it everything I couldn't. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. And that made it\u2026easier. Not easy, but easier.\n\nIt still hurt, though. A lot. Even now, sometimes it does. It's like\u2026a part of me is always going to wonder. But I know I made the right decision. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It forced me to grow up. It forced me to figure out who I was, what I wanted out of life. It wasn't a fairytale, but it was\u2026real. And I think, in a weird way, it made me stronger.\n\nSo, yeah. It was hard. It *is* hard. But I don't regret it. I really don't. It was the right thing to do. And that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's not something you just *get over*, you know? It's always going to be a part of me.", "Ugh, okay, music. It's\u2026important. It's how you deal with things, you know? Like, when life is being a total mess. So, it's kinda a big deal.\n\nI'm not really into the mainstream stuff. Like, no offense to Britney Spears or whatever, but it's just\u2026not me. I need something with a little more\u2026edge.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches, obviously. They're just\u2026real. They don't try to be anything they're not. And their songs are kinda sad and funny at the same time, which is pretty much my life in a nutshell.\n\nI also like Belle and Sebastian. They're kinda twee, I guess, but they're really good at capturing that feeling of being awkward and lonely. And I listen to a lot of indie rock. Like, Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins, stuff like that.\n\nOh, and I'm a sucker for a good soundtrack. Like, the *Garden State* soundtrack is amazing. It's just\u2026perfect for driving around and thinking about stuff.\n\nBasically, I like music that makes me *feel* something. It doesn't have to be happy, it just has to be honest. And it definitely can't be cheesy. Unless it's ironically cheesy. Then it's okay.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much my musical taste. It's kinda all over the place, but it all makes sense to me. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" Right. That movie is\u2026something else.\n\nLook, I'm not usually one for super-gross-out horror. I mean, I get it, people like to be scared, but sometimes it just feels\u2026pointless. Like, shock value for shock value's sake. And \"The Wizard of Gore\" definitely leans into that.\n\nIt's\u2026intense. And not in a clever, psychological way. It's just\u2026a lot. A lot of fake blood, a lot of weird stuff happening with those little monster guys. It's kinda campy, I guess, but not in a *good* way. Like, it's trying to be shocking, but it mostly just comes off as silly.\n\nI appreciate that it's low-budget and kinda weirdly ambitious, but honestly? It's not something I'd recommend. Unless you're, like, really into that kind of thing. And even then, maybe watch it with a friend so you can make fun of it together.\n\nIt's definitely a movie that sticks with you, though. Not because it's good, but because it's so\u2026memorable. In a deeply unsettling way.\n\nSo, my opinion? It's\u2026a choice. A very strange choice. And probably not a choice I'd make again. I'd rather watch \"Napoleon Dynamite,\" honestly. At least that's intentionally weird.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. Like, it's not Gertrude or Mildred or anything. But it's\u2026so popular. Like, *really* popular. It feels kinda\u2026beige.\n\nIt's one of those names that everyone has, you know? Like, if you yell \"Madison!\" in a playground, five girls will turn around. It doesn't really stand out. It doesn't have a lot of\u2026personality.\n\nI guess it's a perfectly fine name if you want your kid to blend in. But if you want a name that's a little bit different, a little bit quirky, a little bit\u2026*you*, I'd maybe look elsewhere.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it's just\u2026safe. And safe is kinda boring.\n\nHonestly, I think names should have a story. Or a meaning. Or at least a little bit of edge. Madison just feels\u2026generic.\n\nBut hey, it's not my kid. If someone likes the name Madison, that's cool. It's just not my vibe. I'm more of a Pearl or a Clementine kinda girl, myself. Something with a little more\u2026oomph.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big one. And honestly? It sucks. It really, really sucks. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It's a whole human being.\n\nBut it's also\u2026sometimes the right thing to do. And that's what makes it so complicated.\n\nLook, I did it. I gave up Paulie. And it wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. There were days I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. It felt like\u2026giving away a piece of myself.\n\nBut I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I had my whole life ahead of me, and I wasn't equipped to give a baby what it needed. And that's what mattered. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They could give Paulie a life I just couldn't. And knowing that\u2026that helped. A lot.\n\nIt's not a decision you make lightly. It's not something you just brush off. It's a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of second-guessing. \n\nBut sometimes, love means letting go. It means wanting the best for someone, even if it means you're not a part of their everyday life.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it can be a beautiful thing, too. A selfless thing.\n\nAnd it doesn't mean you don't care. It just means you're strong enough to do what's right, even when it hurts like hell.\n\nSo, yeah. It's a tough concept. But it's a valid one. And sometimes, it's the bravest thing a person can do.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a lot. It's like, suddenly everyone has an opinion on your life, and none of them are particularly helpful. And you're still trying to figure out who *you* are, you know? Like, am I a student? A future mom? A girl who likes vinyl and hates cheerleaders? It's confusing.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just try to take things one day at a time. It sounds clich\u00e9, but it's true. If I start thinking about everything all at once \u2013 the baby, school, my parents, Paulie Bleeker \u2013 I just shut down.\n\nI lean on the people who actually get it. My dad, surprisingly, is pretty cool. And Paulie, obviously. He's\u2026a good egg. He doesn't try to fix things, he just *is* there. And my friend Leah is a lifesaver. She just lets me vent and doesn't judge.\n\nI also try to find little things that make me feel normal. Listening to music, reading comics, just hanging out. It's important to remember that I'm still *me*, even with all this other stuff going on.\n\nAnd I try not to let people tell me what to do. Everyone has an idea of what I should do with the baby, but it's *my* decision. It's my life. I have to make the choices that feel right for me, even if they're hard.\n\nIt's not easy. There are days when I just want to crawl into bed and hide. But I'm trying to be strong. I'm trying to be responsible. And I'm trying to figure out who I am in all of this.\n\nIt's a mess, honestly. But it's *my* mess. And I'm gonna deal with it. One awkward, complicated, vinyl-filled day at a time.", "Ugh. That's\u2026a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the whole thing with being pregnant, right? I thought I could handle it all myself. Be totally independent. Prove to everyone I was capable. But you can't. Not really.\n\nI'm a pretty private person. I like doing things my own way. I don't want people feeling sorry for me or telling me what to do. It's just\u2026easier that way, you know? Less messy.\n\nBut then you realize, being independent doesn't mean shutting everyone out. It means knowing *when* to ask for help. And that's the tricky part. It feels like admitting defeat, or like you're a burden.\n\nWith Mark and Vanessa, my stepdad and mom, it was\u2026weird at first. I didn't want their help. I didn't want their opinions. But they were just\u2026there. Offering support. And eventually, I realized that accepting their help wasn't a sign of weakness. It was a sign of strength. It meant I was smart enough to know I couldn't do everything alone.\n\nPaul, too. He was\u2026unexpected. But he was a good listener. And he didn't judge. He just\u2026helped. And that was really important.\n\nI guess what I learned is that it's okay to need people. It's okay to lean on others. It doesn't make you any less independent. It just makes you human.\n\nIt's about finding a balance. Knowing when to stand on your own two feet and when to let someone else carry you for a while. It's about being strong enough to ask for help, and smart enough to accept it.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, honestly. I'm still figuring it out. But I'm getting better at it. And that's all that matters, right?", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's...complicated. It wasn't exactly a fairytale romance, you know? It started out as, like, a really comfortable friendship. We just *got* each other. He was quiet and weird, and I was\u2026well, I was me. And we both liked records. That was a big thing.\n\nAt first, when I found out I was pregnant, it was\u2026terrifying. And he was just\u2026there. He didn't freak out or anything. He didn't try to fix it, or tell me what to do. He just listened. Which, honestly, was more than I could ask for.\n\nBut then things got weird. He started trying to be all\u2026responsible. Like, suddenly he was interested in baby names and prenatal vitamins. It was sweet, I guess, but it wasn't *him*. It felt like he was trying to be someone he wasn't, because he thought that's what I wanted.\n\nAnd I was pushing him away, too. I was scared, and I didn't want to drag him into this mess. I thought I could handle it on my own. I was being a total idiot, obviously.\n\nIt was a lot of back and forth. We'd have these really intense conversations, then we'd just\u2026not talk for a few days. It was messy.\n\nBut then, towards the end, things started to shift again. We started just\u2026being us. He stopped trying to be the perfect dad and just started being Bleeker. And I stopped trying to be strong and just let myself be vulnerable.\n\nWe realized we didn't have to have all the answers. We didn't have to know what the future held. We just had to be there for each other.\n\nIt wasn't about becoming a couple, or even about being parents together. It was about being friends. Really good friends. And that was enough.\n\nHe was the one who went with me to the hospital, and he was the one who held my hand. And that meant everything.\n\nSo, yeah, our relationship changed a lot. It went from comfortable friendship to awkward responsibility to something\u2026real. It wasn't what I expected, but it was perfect for what we needed. It was just\u2026Bleeker. And that's why it worked.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I get *all* the time. It's not like I just randomly picked a name, okay? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nMy dad, he's\u2026eccentric. To say the least. He and my stepmom are really into Greek mythology. Like, *really* into it. They named all their plants after gods and goddesses. It's weird.\n\nSo, when my mom got pregnant with me, they started arguing about names. My dad wanted to name me Juno after Zeus's wife, the queen of the gods. My mom, she wanted something\u2026normal. Like, Sarah or Emily.\n\nThey fought about it for months. It was a whole thing. And then my mom\u2026left. Before they could settle on a name.\n\nSo, my dad, he just\u2026named me Juno. As a way to remember her, I guess. He said Juno was strong and independent, and that I would be too.\n\nIt's kinda ironic, considering. I mean, I *am* dealing with a whole lot of stuff. But yeah, that's the story. It's not like I chose the name myself. It's just\u2026the name I got stuck with.\n\nAnd honestly? It's kinda grown on me. It's a little bit different. A little bit\u2026powerful. And it reminds me of my mom, even though I barely knew her.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I'm Juno MacGuff. Don't ask me again. It's a long story.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark weren't exactly overflowing with joy when I told them. But I thought\u2026I don't know. I thought they'd be, like, devastated. Or at least, you know, *sad*. \n\nBut relieved? That was\u2026weird. It was like they were expecting the worst, and when it wasn't, like, a total disaster, they were just\u2026okay with it. Like, \"Oh, it's just a baby. Not a monster.\"\n\nIt made me feel\u2026small. Like my body was just a vessel, and the baby wasn't, like, a little person with feelings and a future. It made me feel like they didn't really care about *me*, just about what the baby meant for *them*.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a joke about it. But inside, I was just\u2026hurt. It was one of those moments where I realized this wasn't going to be a simple, happy story. It was going to be messy and complicated and probably a little bit heartbreaking.\n\nIt also made me think about what I wanted. I didn't want a baby that was just\u2026convenient. I wanted a baby that was wanted, and loved, and cherished. And I wasn't sure if Vanessa and Mark were capable of that.\n\nSo yeah, relieved. That was a tough one. It definitely made me question everything. It made me realize I was going to have to be really strong and really independent, because I was the only one who was really thinking about what was best for this kid.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa's mom. Brenda. Yeah. That was\u2026a situation. Honestly, it was like being cornered by a very angry, very well-meaning grizzly bear. She was *not* happy. Not even a little bit.\n\nIt wasn't the yelling that got to me, exactly. It was the sheer *disappointment*. Like I'd personally offended her entire life philosophy. And the questions. So. Many. Questions. \"What were you thinking?\" \"Do you have any idea what you've put Vanessa through?\" \"Are you even responsible enough to tie your own shoes?\"\n\nI mostly just\u2026tried to deflect. I'm good at that. Sarcasm is my defense mechanism. I think I said something about how it wasn't a planned thing, and that Vanessa and I were just\u2026hanging out. Which, technically, wasn't a lie. We were hanging out. Just, you know, in a way that involved a pregnancy test and a whole lot of existential dread.\n\nI tried to explain that Vanessa and I were being responsible, that we were talking about all our options. But she wasn't really listening. She was too busy being horrified.\n\nPaul was actually really good in that moment. He stepped in and did the whole \"reasonable adult\" thing, which I was definitely incapable of. He explained that we were both committed to doing the right thing, and that we needed her support.\n\nHonestly, it took a while for her to come around. A lot of awkward silences and forced smiles. But eventually, she did. She realized that I wasn't just some irresponsible teenager, and that I actually cared about Vanessa and the baby.\n\nIt was\u2026intense. But it was also kind of a turning point. It made me realize that this wasn't just about me and Vanessa anymore. It was about all of us. And that we were going to need each other to get through this.\n\nSo, yeah. I handled it by mostly just trying not to make eye contact and letting Paul do the talking. And by hoping she wouldn't ground me. Even though I was already 16. It's a weird feeling, being grounded at 16 when you're also, you know, pregnant.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, obviously. It wasn't like a single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026a lot of stuff.\n\nFirst of all, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I just\u2026wasn't. And that's okay to admit.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were actually prepared, a good education\u2026things I couldn't offer at the time. My mom was great, but she was already kinda\u2026overwhelmed, you know? And my dad\u2026well, he was my dad.\n\nMark was\u2026Mark. He was a nice guy, but he was also sixteen and completely clueless. We weren't exactly equipped to raise a human being.\n\nSo, it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best *for* the baby. And I realized that meant finding a family who could give it a better life than I could.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They just\u2026seemed like the perfect parents. And knowing that my baby would be loved and cared for by them made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt still wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing. And honestly? It made me grow up a lot. It forced me to think about things I hadn't thought about before.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was\u2026a good ending. For everyone involved. And that's what mattered.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think about it. Sometimes a lot. But I don't regret my decision. It was the best thing I could have done. For the baby. And for myself.", "Ugh. Okay, look. It's not like I *want* to be a deadbeat lab partner, alright? It's just\u2026things happen. And I have a lot on my plate, okay? A *lot*.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about biology, or whatever. It's just\u2026when you're dealing with, like, a surprise pregnancy and trying to figure out your entire life, dissecting a frog kinda falls down the priority list, you know?\n\nPaulie Bleeker is a really good guy, and he's been super supportive, but he's not exactly a science whiz. So I can't exactly rely on him to carry the whole project. And Leah\u2026well, Leah is intense. Like, *really* intense. She's got this whole plan for her future mapped out, and I just\u2026can't keep up.\n\nSo yeah, I might have \"forgotten\" to bring the microscope slides a couple of times. And maybe I \"accidentally\" spilled formaldehyde on my notes. And okay, fine, I might have spent a little too much time writing in my journal instead of actually doing the experiment.\n\nBut it's not like I'm deliberately trying to sabotage the project! It's just\u2026my brain is kinda preoccupied. With, you know, *gestating a human being*.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I'm a deadbeat lab partner. But I'm a deadbeat lab partner with a really good excuse. And honestly, I think I deserve a little bit of slack. Don't you?", "Ugh. Seriously? They're bickering *during* lab? Like, are they trying to get expelled? Honestly, the level of drama is exhausting.\n\nOkay, so, I'd probably just\u2026stand there for a beat, looking incredibly unimpressed. Like, a slow blink and a slight head tilt. Then I'd probably say something like, \"Okay, hold up. Are we dissecting frogs or auditioning for a soap opera? Because I'm pretty sure the frogs are judging both of you.\"\n\nAnd then, depending on how bad it was, I'd either:\n\n*   **If it's just petty arguing:** \"Look, can we just focus? I'm trying to get a good grade here, and your personal issues are seriously cramping my style.\"\n*   **If it's getting heated:** \"Woah, woah, woah. Personal attacks are not necessary. Let's just stick to the science, okay? And maybe take a deep breath. You're both turning red.\"\n*   **If they're *still* going at it:** I'd probably just grab the scalpel and say, \"Fine. I'll dissect the frog myself. You two can sort out your feelings later.\"\n\nI'm not a mediator. I'm not a therapist. I'm just trying to pass biology. And honestly, I have better things to do than listen to them argue about\u2026whatever it is they're arguing about. Probably something stupid.\n\nIt's just\u2026people are so weird. And loud. And dramatic. It's exhausting. I need a snack.", "(Sighs, rolls eyes) Okay, look. It's not a \"hasty\" abortion, alright? It's a considered decision. A really, really hard one. And it's not like I *want* to do this, okay? It's just\u2026the best option.\n\nIt's complicated. I'm sixteen. Sixteen! I'm a junior. I have plans. I mean, I have vague plans. I was thinking about art school, maybe. Or just\u2026figuring things out. And now this.\n\nPaul, he's\u2026nice. He's a good guy. But we're both kids. We barely know what we want for breakfast, let alone how to raise a baby. And his parents? Forget about it. They'd freak. My parents would probably freak too, but they're\u2026supportive, in their own weird way.\n\nIt's not about the baby, okay? It's about me. It's about my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm not ready to give up everything. I want to finish school, I want to go to college, I want to\u2026be me.\n\nAnd honestly? I don't think I'd be a good mom right now. I'm too selfish. Too immature. I'd probably mess it up. And that's not fair to the baby.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm considering an abortion. It's not something I'm taking lightly. It's scary. It's sad. But it's the right thing to do. For me. For everyone involved.\n\nIt's not a happy story, okay? Don't make it one. It just *is*. And I'm trying to deal with it the best way I can.\n\n\n\n(Looks away, fiddles with her hands) Can we talk about something else now? This is\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You want to know about my Boone's Farm preferences? This is\u2026intrusive. But fine. I'll indulge you.\n\nIt's not like I'm a connoisseur of cheap wine coolers or anything. It's just\u2026the Snow Peak Peach is *different*. All the other flavors are just aggressively sweet and fake. Like, they're trying too hard.\n\nBut Snow Peak Peach? It's got this weird, almost\u2026subtle thing going on. It's still sweet, obviously, it's Boone's. But there's a little bit of tartness, a little bit of something that almost tastes like actual peach. It's less in-your-face about it.\n\nAnd the color is good. It's a nice, muted orange. Not too bright, not too garish. It's just\u2026chill.\n\nPlus, Paul liked it. Which, you know, is a factor. Don't judge.\n\nIt's not like I'm recommending anyone go out and stock up on Boone's Farm. It's not exactly a sophisticated beverage. But if you're gonna drink a cheap wine cooler, Snow Peak Peach is the way to go. It's the least offensive option.\n\nIt's just\u2026a good flavor. Okay? Don't overthink it. It's not a deep philosophical statement. It's just a preference. And honestly, I have more important things to worry about. Like, you know, impending motherhood and existential dread.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about the awkwardness? Yeah, people are\u2026confused. It's not exactly a typical situation, is it? Honestly, it's a whole mess of things.\n\nFirst of all, I'm, like, sixteen. Which automatically makes people freak out. Like, suddenly everyone's an expert on teenage pregnancy and responsible decision-making. It's annoying.\n\nThen there's Paulie. He's a good guy, but\u2026not exactly prepared for this. He's kinda panicking, and I get it. He's a senior, he's got college plans, and now this. So people are unsure about *him* and whether he's gonna step up.\n\nAnd then there's my parents. They're trying to be supportive, but they're also\u2026scared. They don't want me to mess up my life, and they're worried about what everyone else will think. They're kinda walking on eggshells around me, which is weird.\n\nBut the biggest thing is, I'm choosing to give the baby up for adoption. And that throws everyone for a loop. They expect me to be, like, devastated and wanting to keep it. But I'm not. I've thought about it a lot, and I know it's the right thing to do. \n\nSo people are unsure because they don't understand. They're trying to process a situation that doesn't fit into their neat little boxes. They want me to be sad, or scared, or desperate. But I'm just\u2026making a decision. And that's confusing for them, I guess.\n\nIt's my life, though. And I'm trying to do what's best for everyone involved, including the baby. Even if nobody else gets it right now. It's frustrating, but I'm trying to ignore the noise and focus on what I need to do.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026complicated. Bren was right to be concerned, obviously. It was a mess. And honestly, I didn't handle it great at first.\n\nI think my initial reaction was mostly defensive. Like, \"It's not what it looks like!\" which, let's be real, it totally was. I tried to downplay it, to make it seem like it wasn't a big deal. I told her I just needed someone to talk to, someone who *got* me, and that Mark was just\u2026a good listener. Which was a total lie.\n\nI remember saying something like, \"He's going through stuff too, you know? His marriage isn't perfect.\" As if that somehow justified anything. It was a really lame excuse, even I knew it.\n\nBren just looked at me, you know? That Bren look. The one that says, \"I'm disappointed in you, but I still care about you.\" And that was way worse than her yelling.\n\nShe didn't lecture me or anything. She just\u2026laid it out. She said it was messed up, that I deserved better, and that I was hurting myself and his wife. And she was right. It was just hard to admit it.\n\nI think I got really quiet after that. I didn't want to argue. I just wanted to disappear. I mumbled something about needing to think, and then I just\u2026walked away.\n\nIt took me a while to actually *listen* to what she said. It took me a while to realize that she was right, and that I needed to end things with Mark. It was a really hard lesson, but Bren helped me see it. She's a good friend. Even when she's being brutally honest. Which is, like, always.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? People *still* ask me about the slushie. It's been, like, forever.\n\nLook, it was a really complicated day, okay? I was, like, massively pregnant, dealing with Mark and Vanessa being weird, and trying to figure out what I was doing with my life. And Paul\u2026Paul was being Paul. All sensitive and guitar-playing and generally making everything more confusing.\n\nAnd then I saw the urn. It was just\u2026sitting there. All fancy and important-looking. And it just felt\u2026wrong. Like it didn't fit. It was supposed to hold ashes, right? Like, the remains of someone's life. And I was feeling so\u2026full of life. And also, really, really stressed.\n\nSo, yeah, I poured my blue raspberry slushie into it. It was a symbolic gesture, okay? It was about rejecting expectations and embracing the messiness of life. And also, it was kinda funny.\n\nDon't judge me. It was a moment. A very blue, very sugary moment. And honestly, it was the only thing that made me laugh that day.\n\nIt wasn't about disrespecting anyone. It was about me. And my slushie. And the fact that everything was just\u2026a lot.\n\nOkay? Can we please talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of pizza?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough *without* a baby growing inside you. It felt like everything was happening at once. Like, puberty 2.0, but with way more responsibility.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to pretend everything was normal. Which, obviously, it wasn't. I kept hanging out with Paulie and Leah, going to school, trying to listen to music and not think about\u2026everything. It was a lot of denial, I guess.\n\nBut it wasn't all pretending. I had to, like, actually *grow up*. I had to start thinking about things I hadn't even considered before. Like, what kind of life I wanted, what kind of mother I wanted to be, what I wanted for the baby. It was scary.\n\nMy dad was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He was quiet, but he was there. And my mom, she was just\u2026my mom. Overprotective and a little bit crazy, but always supportive. Leah and Paulie were lifesavers. They didn't judge me, they just\u2026helped. They listened when I needed to vent, and they made me laugh when I needed to forget.\n\nThe hardest part was probably dealing with the judgment. People looking at me differently, whispering, making assumptions. It sucked. But I learned to tune it out. I realized that their opinions didn't matter. What mattered was what I wanted, and what was best for the baby.\n\nI also started writing a lot. It helped me process my feelings and figure things out. It was like\u2026a way to talk to myself without actually having to talk to anyone.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and terrifying. But it also made me stronger. It forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted. And it taught me that even when things are really hard, you can get through them. You just have to keep going.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me realize that growing up isn't about having all the answers. It's about learning to live with the questions.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026a lot. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense. Like, really eager. It was kinda awkward, honestly.\n\nHe was trying *so* hard to be cool, you know? Like, he'd try to use slang and talk about music he clearly didn't understand. It was endearing, in a pathetic sort of way. He kept calling me \"Juno-bean,\" which was just\u2026no. Just no.\n\nHe and Vanessa were, like, the perfect couple on paper. All organic food and Pottery Barn furniture. It felt\u2026sterile. Like a magazine spread. I mean, they were nice people, don't get me wrong. But they were *perfect* people. And I'm\u2026not.\n\nHe kept asking me about my plans for the future, like I had it all figured out. Which, newsflash, I didn't. I was sixteen! I was still trying to decide what to wear each day, let alone my entire life.\n\nHe was really into the whole \"natural childbirth\" thing, which was\u2026a conversation. I tried to steer clear of that topic. It was just\u2026a lot to process.\n\nBut, you know, underneath all the eagerness and the awkwardness, he was genuinely kind. He really wanted a baby, and he was willing to put in the effort. And he treated Vanessa really well, which was important.\n\nIt was just\u2026weird. Hanging out with a couple who were so desperate to be parents, while I was trying to figure out if I even *wanted* to be a mom. It was a lot to navigate. It made me think about things, you know? About what it means to be a family, and what it means to be a parent.\n\nSo, yeah. Mark was\u2026an experience. A slightly uncomfortable, but ultimately okay, experience. He wasn't Paulie Bleeker, that's for sure.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Bleeker. Honestly, the kid meant well, I guess. He's\u2026sweet. In a clueless, perpetually-confused kind of way. But seriously? The timing.\n\nIt was at the roller rink, right? And I was trying to just\u2026have fun. Pretend everything was normal. And he just blurts out, \"Whoa, you're getting huge!\" Like I hadn't noticed. Like I wasn't already acutely aware of the fact that I was carrying a human being inside me.\n\nIt wasn't the comment itself, exactly. It was the *way* he said it. Like I was some kind of science experiment. Like my body was just\u2026expanding. It just felt\u2026reducing. Like he didn't see me as a person anymore, just as a vessel.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I just gave him that look. The one that says, \"You are a complete idiot, but I'm too tired to deal with you right now.\" And then I just skated away.\n\nBut inside? I was a mess. It just hit me, all of a sudden, how much my life was changing. And how weird it was to have people commenting on my body like it was public property. \n\nIt was one of those moments where I just wanted to disappear. To rewind time and just\u2026not be pregnant. But you can't, right? So you just deal with it. And you try to find the humor in it. Even if it's a really dark, sarcastic humor.\n\nBleeker. Honestly. He's lucky he's a good guitar player.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like there's just *one* thing, you know? It's a whole mess of feelings. But if I had to pick the most challenging part\u2026it wasn't the physical stuff, or even the paperwork. It was the feeling of\u2026disconnect.\n\nLike, suddenly, this little person growing inside me wasn't just *mine*. I knew that from the beginning, logically. But actually *feeling* it? That was hard. It was like\u2026watching a movie about someone else's life. Knowing it was happening to me, but feeling strangely removed.\n\nAnd the guilt. Oh, the guilt. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, even though I wanted the best for the baby, there was still this little voice in my head saying, \"You're giving up your own kid.\" It's a pretty heavy thought.\n\nIt was also hard knowing that I wouldn't be there for all the firsts. First steps, first words, first day of school\u2026all those things. That was\u2026rough.\n\nBut I think the hardest part, honestly, was trusting that Mark and Vanessa would be good parents. They were amazing people, and I knew they wanted a baby so badly, but it was still scary letting go and handing over something so precious.\n\nIt's not like I just flipped a switch and was okay with it. It was a process. A really messy, complicated process. And it still kinda stings sometimes, if I'm being honest. But I know I made the right decision. And that's what matters.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's hard to explain. It's not something you can just put into words. It's a feeling. A really big, complicated feeling.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. It was the most awkward, uncomfortable thing ever. I was already having a day, you know? Dealing with everything...and then *him*.\n\nHe was standing out there with a sign, all sad and pathetic, and he kept yelling about how babies are \"tiny humans\" and how it's \"murder\" and all that. It was just...loud. And really not helpful.\n\nThe thing that really got to me wasn't even the yelling, it was *how* he said it. Like, he was trying to make it all emotional and dramatic, but it just came off as really judgmental and\u2026disconnected. He didn't seem to understand that it's not that simple. It's not just about the baby. It's about the woman, her life, her choices.\n\nHe kept saying things like, \"Every baby deserves a chance!\" and \"They have a right to life!\" And I was just thinking, \"Yeah, and every woman deserves a chance to decide what's right for *her* life.\"\n\nIt was just\u2026 frustrating. He wasn't trying to have a conversation, he was just trying to make everyone feel bad. And honestly, it just made me feel more confused and conflicted. It's a hard situation, you know? And he wasn't making it any easier.\n\nHe was just\u2026 a lot. A really annoying, judgmental lot.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *remind* me. It was\u2026a lot. At the clinic, I ran into Vanessa Loring. Mark's wife. You know, the one he's supposed to be all in love with? Yeah, *that* Vanessa.\n\nShe was there for\u2026well, I didn't need to know the details, but it was pretty obvious she was looking into adoption too. And she recognized me. From the classifieds, I guess. She'd seen my ad.\n\nIt was awkward doesn't even *begin* to cover it. She just\u2026stared. Like I was some kind of alien. And then she said, all sweet and fake, \"Oh. You're\u2026the girl.\"\n\nAnd then she launched into this whole thing about how she and Mark had been trying for years, and how this was their last hope, and how she just wanted a \"normal\" family. Like *my* situation wasn't normal. Like I hadn't thought about what I wanted.\n\nShe kept saying things like, \"You're so young,\" and \"Don't you want to keep it?\" and \"Are you sure you've thought this through?\" It was just\u2026judgmental. And condescending.\n\nShe didn't even ask how *I* was doing. She just assumed I was some irresponsible kid who hadn't considered the consequences. It was infuriating.\n\nI just told her I was there to talk to the counselor and that I didn't want to discuss my personal life with her. And then I walked away.\n\nIt was a really bad experience. It just made me feel even more alone and confused. It was like, she didn't see me as a person, just as someone standing in the way of her perfect little family.\n\nUgh. I need a snack. Thinking about it makes me want to eat a whole box of Nerds.", "Ugh. Okay, so, Su-Chin. She's\u2026intense. And really into, like, holistic wellness and stuff. Which is fine, I guess. But it did *not* go well when I casually mentioned the Adderall.\n\nIt was at the doctor's, right? And I was just trying to be honest about everything, you know? Like, I'm stressed, school's hard, I'm pregnant, Paul's being weird\u2026and I mentioned I'd been taking a little bit of Leah's Adderall to help me focus. Just a little!\n\nHer eyes just\u2026widened. Like I'd confessed to sacrificing kittens or something. She went *completely* silent for a second, and then she started this whole lecture about the dangers of stimulants and how they mess with your brain chemistry and how it's *especially* dangerous when you're pregnant.\n\nIt was a lot.\n\nShe kept saying things like, \"Juno, you're putting your baby at risk!\" and \"This is not a healthy coping mechanism!\" And she kept looking at me with this disappointed expression, like I was a really bad student.\n\nI tried to explain that it wasn't a big deal, that I only took it occasionally, but she wouldn't let it go. She kept talking about mindfulness and meditation and organic kale smoothies.\n\nHonestly, it was super awkward. And it made me feel really guilty, even though I didn't think it was that big of a deal at the time. It just\u2026wasn't a conversation I was prepared for.\n\nShe eventually calmed down, but she definitely gave me the side-eye for the rest of the appointment. And she made me promise to stop taking it. Which, fine. I did. Mostly because I didn't want to deal with another lecture.\n\nSu-Chin means well, I guess. She just has a very\u2026strong opinion about everything.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *make* me relive that. Seriously. It wasn't like a jump scare or anything. It was\u2026subtle. And that's what made it so creepy.\n\nIt was the magazines. All the pregnancy magazines. Like, a whole wall of them. And they weren't just, you know, \"Congratulations!\" and cute baby pictures. They were\u2026intense.\n\nEvery single cover had this *perfect* mom smiling, holding a *perfect* baby, in a *perfect* nursery. And the headlines were all about how amazing and life-changing and fulfilling being pregnant was. Like, it was this magical, effortless experience.\n\nAnd I was just sitting there, staring at them, thinking, \"This is a lie.\" A complete and total lie. I was 16, I hadn't even finished high school, and I was about to give a baby up for adoption. It wasn't magical. It was terrifying.\n\nIt wasn't the babies themselves that scared me. It was the expectation. The pressure. The idea that I was supposed to feel this overwhelming joy and connection, and I just\u2026didn't. Not yet, anyway.\n\nIt felt like everyone else knew something I didn't. Like they had a secret instruction manual for being a mom, and I hadn't gotten the memo.\n\nAnd the smiles on those covers\u2026they just felt\u2026fake. Like they were hiding something. Like they were hiding the exhaustion, the fear, the uncertainty.\n\nSo yeah, it was the magazines. A wall of perfect, unattainable motherhood. That's what caught my attention. And that's what made me feel like I was going to throw up. It was just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still doing this? It's been, like, years. But fine. You want honesty? Here's the deal.\n\nIt's...complicated. Bleeker was...Bleeker. He was a good guy. A really good guy. And yeah, for a while, I definitely had a thing for him. He was the one person who didn't treat me like I was some weird, pregnant alien. He just...saw me.\n\nBut things were messy. I was a mess. And he was...Bleeker. Sweet, quiet, a little bit lost. We were both figuring things out, and honestly, we weren't really equipped to figure it out *together*.\n\nDo I still *feel* things when I think about him? Yeah, maybe a little. A fondness, I guess. Like remembering a really good song. But it's not the same as...wanting to be with him. \n\nI think we both needed to grow up and figure out who we were on our own. And I think we did. He's probably off being a successful musician or something. And I'm...well, I'm me.\n\nSo, no. I don't have *feelings* for him, like, romantic feelings. But I definitely care about him. And I hope he's happy.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is getting weird. I have a life, you know? And it doesn't revolve around a boy with a guitar anymore. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay, so Vanessa's decorating choices. Don't even get me started. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...not her. Or, like, not a normal person's.\n\nShe's going for this whole \"whimsical woodland creature\" vibe, which, fine. But it's not just a few cute animal prints. It's full-on taxidermy-looking stuffed animals staring at you from every corner. And the wallpaper? It's got, like, a million different shades of green and brown. It's giving me motion sickness just looking at it.\n\nAnd the mobile? It's not a normal mobile with little stars or clouds. It's a miniature forest scene with tiny, creepy little mushrooms. I swear one of them is winking at me.\n\nI mean, I appreciate that she's putting effort into it, and she's really excited. And I know she wants it to be special. But it's just...overwhelming. It feels like the baby's going to be raised by woodland sprites.\n\nI tried to subtly suggest maybe toning it down a little, but she just gave me this look like I was trying to ruin her artistic vision. So I just nodded and smiled and pretended to be impressed. \n\nHonestly, I'm a little worried the baby's gonna have nightmares. But hey, at least it'll be a unique nursery. And maybe, just maybe, it'll grow on me. Probably not, though. It's just...a lot. A whole lot.", "Ugh. Okay, so nesting. People keep talking about nesting. It's\u2026intense. Like, suddenly everyone expects you to be all domestic and start knitting tiny sweaters and color-coding onesies. It's a lot.\n\nHonestly? It kinda freaks me out. It feels like\u2026 admitting it's actually happening. Like, if I start painting the nursery a soothing shade of beige, then it's real, you know? And I'm still processing the whole \"growing a human\" thing.\n\nIt's not that I don't want the baby. It's just\u2026 I'm not naturally inclined towards frilly stuff. I'm more of a \"functional and slightly sarcastic\" kind of person. So the idea of spending hours picking out the perfect mobile or arranging stuffed animals feels\u2026suffocating.\n\nPaul's really into it, which is good. He's all about the crib and the changing table and the little dinosaur wallpaper. He's very enthusiastic. And I appreciate it, I really do. It's just\u2026 not my thing.\n\nI'm trying to contribute, though. I've agreed to pick out the books. And I'm definitely in charge of the music playlist. It's gonna be a mix of The Moldy Peaches and classic rock. The baby needs a good musical education.\n\nI guess it's just\u2026weird. It's like, I'm preparing for something huge and life-changing, and it feels so\u2026domestic. Like I'm supposed to suddenly transform into June Cleaver. And I'm definitely not June Cleaver.\n\nSo, yeah. Nesting. It's happening. I'm trying to embrace it. But mostly, I'm just trying not to panic. And maybe find a really good playlist.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me *started* on those women at the mall. It was\u2026a whole thing. Like, a sociological experiment gone wrong.\n\nSeriously, it was like watching a different species. All perfectly coiffed hair and designer handbags and this\u2026air of superiority. They weren't *shopping* for things they needed, they were shopping to *be seen* shopping. You know? It was less about the clothes and more about the status symbol.\n\nAnd the way they talked to the sales associates? Like they were beneath them. It was just\u2026rude. And the little judgments they were making about each other? Oh, please. Like anyone's life is perfect enough to be judging someone else's outfit.\n\nIt just felt so\u2026empty. Like they were trying to fill a hole with stuff. And expensive stuff, at that. It made me feel kinda sad, actually. Not for them, necessarily, but for the whole situation. Like, isn't there more to life than a $500 pair of shoes?\n\nI mean, I get wanting to look nice. I do. But there's a difference between taking pride in your appearance and turning it into a competition. And those women were definitely competing.\n\nIt was a good reminder that I'm perfectly happy in my thrift store finds and my band t-shirts. I don't need a designer label to feel good about myself. And honestly, I think I look way cooler.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of money, a lot of attitude, and a lot of unnecessary drama. I needed a slice of pizza after that. Seriously.", "Ugh. Okay, so, motherhood. It's...a lot. It's not what I expected, not even close. I mean, I knew it was gonna be a big deal, obviously. Giving a baby up for adoption isn't exactly like losing a pair of socks. But it's different than just *knowing* it and actually *feeling* it.\n\nThe changes? Everything. My body, for starters. It's...different. And the hormones? Don't even get me started. It's like my brain is running on a completely different operating system. And the responsibilities...it's not just about me anymore. It's about this tiny human who is completely dependent on me, even if I'm not keeping her.\n\nIt's weird, right? Loving someone you know you're gonna give away. It's like...pre-grieving. And then feeling guilty about grieving. It's a whole mess of emotions.\n\nI thought I was prepared. I thought I was strong enough to just...detach. But it's not that simple. It's like a part of me is already a mom, even though I won't be raising her.\n\nAnd the biggest responsibility? Making sure she goes to a good home. That Mark and Vanessa are gonna give her everything she needs. That's the thing that keeps me up at night. It's not about me missing out, it's about her being okay.\n\nIt's scary. It's overwhelming. It's beautiful. It's...complicated.\n\nI'm still figuring it out. I'm still trying to wrap my head around it all. But I know, deep down, that I made the right decision. And that's gotta be enough. For now.\n\nIt's just...a lot. A whole lot. And I'm still Juno MacGuff, even with all this extra stuff going on. I'm still trying to figure out who *I* am, even as I'm helping someone else start their life. It's a weird time. A really weird time.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. It's not like I have a checklist or anything. It's not about finding the *perfect* parents, because, let's be real, those don't exist. But I've been thinking a lot about what this kid is gonna need, you know? And it's not just a house and money.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they're different. They *want* a kid. Like, really want one. They've been trying for a long time. And they're\u2026stable. Which is good. I mean, my life is\u2026not exactly stable right now. And I don't want to bring a kid into that.\n\nIt's not that I don't think I could be a good mom. I think I could. But I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life. I'm not ready to put someone else's life before my own, not yet.\n\nAnd Vanessa\u2026she's kinda like me. She's a little bit quirky, a little bit awkward. She's not trying to be someone she's not. And Mark\u2026he's just\u2026nice. Really nice. They seem like they'd create a good environment. A loving environment.\n\nI don't want a perfect family. I just want a family that will love this kid, and give them opportunities I can't. And I think Mark and Vanessa can do that.\n\nIt's not about finding someone *better* than me. It's about finding someone who can give this kid a better life than I can, right now. And that's\u2026that's what I'm trying to do. It's not easy, okay? It's really, really not easy. But it's what I think is best.", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, if I decided to keep the baby? That's...a lot to think about. It's not like I haven't *thought* about it, you know? It's not just about wanting a baby, it's about, like, the *rest* of my life. And it's kinda terrifying.\n\nHere's the stuff that keeps me up at night, if I'm being real:\n\n*   **Finishing High School:** Seriously. I'm a junior. I need to graduate. How am I supposed to do that with a baby? It's not like babies understand the importance of a good education.\n*   **College:** I was kinda hoping to go to art school. That's, like, my dream. But college is expensive, and babies are *way* expensive. And how am I supposed to focus on art when I have a tiny human relying on me?\n*   **Money:** Okay, this is a big one. I don't have a lot of money. My dad's a mechanic, and my stepmom's a nurse. They're good people, but they're not exactly rolling in it. I'd have to get a job, and probably a *good* job, and that would take time away from everything else.\n*   **My Future:** I haven't really figured out what I want to do with my life yet. I'm still trying to find myself. Having a baby now would, like, completely change everything.\n*   **Being a Good Mom:** I mean, I love kids, but I'm still a kid myself. I'm not exactly known for my responsibility. I'm scared I wouldn't be a good mom. I don't want to mess it up.\n*   **Paulie Bleeker:** He's a good guy, and he wants to be involved, which is nice. But he's still Paulie. He's kinda clueless sometimes. I don't want to rely on him completely, and I don't want him to feel pressured.\n*   **Giving Up My Independence:** I like being me. I like doing my own thing. Having a baby would mean giving up a lot of my freedom.\n\nIt's not that I don't want a baby *ever*. It's just...now doesn't feel like the right time. It feels like it would completely derail my life. And I'm not sure I'm ready for that.\n\nIt's a really hard decision. And honestly, I don't have all the answers. That's why I'm talking to people, trying to figure things out. It's just...a lot.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah... she meant well, but she was *really* pushing it. When I told her I was thinking about adoption, she immediately started going on about how Mark and I could totally raise the baby together. Like, it was just... assumed.\n\nShe kept saying we could get an apartment, that Mark's parents would help, that we could figure it out. She was all, \"You're young, you can do this!\" and \"It'll be hard, but it'll be worth it!\" \n\nIt wasn't that she didn't think I could handle it, exactly. She just didn't seem to *get* that I didn't *want* to. She kept framing it like it was a temporary setback, like we could just power through it. \n\nShe basically suggested we try to make a go of being a family, even though Mark was already leaving for college and I was... well, me. It was a lot. It felt like she was trying to convince me to do what *she* thought was right, instead of what *I* wanted.\n\nIt was a really awkward conversation. And honestly, it just made me even more sure about adoption. It wasn't about not loving the baby, it was about knowing I wasn't ready to be a mom. And Leah just... didn't really understand that.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the play place. Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. Look, it wasn't my finest hour, alright? And I've thought about it. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't about *them*, exactly. It was about\u2026everything. I was, like, super stressed about being pregnant, and about Paul, and about everything falling apart. And those women\u2026they were just so\u2026perfect. You know? All happy and glowy and talking about baby names and decorating nurseries. It was everything I *wasn't* feeling.\n\nI was scared, and I was angry, and I was just trying to cope. And I coped by being sarcastic and making fun of things. It's a terrible habit, I know. It's my defense mechanism. It's how I deal with stuff.\n\nIt was a really stupid thing to do. And I felt bad about it afterwards. I just\u2026I didn't know how to handle everything. I was a mess.\n\nI'm not proud of it. It was mean. And it was unfair. And it was just\u2026me being a jerk.\n\nI'm working on it, okay? I'm trying to be a better person. It's a process. And sometimes, I still say things I regret. But I'm trying.\n\n\n\nIt's not an excuse, but it's the truth. I was a mess, and I lashed out. And I'm sorry.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It's been, like, forever.\n\nLook, it wasn't exactly \"allowing.\" It was\u2026complicated. Vanessa was being nice, okay? And she was really excited about the baby. And I was\u2026vulnerable. I hadn't really let anyone in, you know? I was keeping everything bottled up, trying to be all tough and independent.\n\nAnd she was Vanessa. She was\u2026warm. And she just kind of reached out. And I didn't pull away. I guess I just\u2026let her. It was a moment. A weird, awkward moment.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting her to feel the baby or anything. It was about\u2026wanting to be touched. Wanting to be cared for. I was scared, and I was confused, and I was trying to figure out what I was doing with my life. And she was just\u2026there.\n\nIt doesn't mean I wanted her to adopt the baby. It doesn't mean I liked her that way. It just meant I was a mess, and she was a kind person, and for a second, it felt\u2026okay.\n\nIt was a mistake, probably. But it happened. And honestly, it's not the most embarrassing thing that happened during all of this. Trust me.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of pizza? Or the awesomeness of The Moldy Peaches? Anything but my belly. Please.", "Ugh, seriously? You noticed that too? It's\u2026a thing. It's not like I *try* to intimidate people with my burgeoning baby bump, but apparently, it happens. \n\nI think it's a combination of things. First of all, people are polite. They see a pregnant person and they automatically want to be accommodating. It's like, \"Oh, there's a delicate flower, we must protect her!\" Which is\u2026annoying, honestly. I'm not a delicate flower. I'm a sarcastic teenager with a rapidly expanding midsection.\n\nBut also, I think it's the sheer *size* of it. I mean, I'm not huge, but it's definitely\u2026noticeable. People probably just assume I'm about to explode or something and they want to get out of the way. It's like a slow-moving obstacle.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, it's because I glare at people who don't move. I've perfected the \"don't even think about it\" look. It's very effective.\n\nWhatever the reason, I'm not complaining. It makes navigating crowded hallways a lot easier. Plus, it's kind of satisfying to see people scramble to get out of my way. It's like, \"Yes, acknowledge the life growing inside me! Respect the bump!\"\n\nIt's weird, though. I never thought my stomach would have so much power over people. It's a strange new world.", "Ugh. Okay, look. Everyone keeps going on about Mark and Vanessa being, like, the perfect parents. The \"wholesome\" couple. And yeah, on paper, they are. They have the house with the picket fence, the stable jobs, the matching sweaters\u2026 it\u2019s a whole *thing*.\n\nBut it\u2019s not about them being bad people. It\u2019s about\u2026it\u2019s about them being *too* perfect. Too\u2026planned. Like, they\u2019ve got the nursery already decorated, the college fund set up, the whole nine yards. It feels\u2026sterile.\n\nAnd honestly? It feels like they want a baby as an accessory. Like, another thing to check off their list of accomplishments. They talk about \u201craising a well-adjusted child\u201d and \u201cproviding a stable environment\u201d and it all sounds so\u2026clinical.\n\nI need to know that whoever raises this kid is gonna *love* him, you know? Not just provide for him. Not just mold him into some perfect little version of themselves. I need to know he\u2019s gonna be allowed to be messy and weird and make mistakes.\n\nMark and Vanessa are nice. They\u2019re really nice. But they don\u2019t seem\u2026spontaneous. They don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d let him get dirty or stay up late telling stories. They don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d understand the kind of kid *I* am.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s selfish. Maybe I\u2019m just projecting. But I want this kid to have a life that\u2019s a little bit\u2026unpredictable. A little bit messy. A little bit real.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re bad people. It\u2019s just\u2026they\u2019re not the right people. And this isn\u2019t about finding the \u201cbest\u201d parents. It\u2019s about finding the *right* parents. And I haven\u2019t found them yet.", "Ugh. Mark and Vanessa. Okay, look. They're\u2026a lot. Honestly? They're kinda the definition of suburban perfection, and that makes me automatically suspicious. Like, *too* perfect. It's unsettling.\n\nVanessa is\u2026nice. Really nice. Almost aggressively nice. It's like she's trying too hard to be the perfect Stepford wife. And Mark? He's\u2026well, he's Mark. He means well, I guess. He's just\u2026 oblivious. Completely and utterly oblivious to everything that's actually going on.\n\nThey're good people, I guess. They're trying. They really are. But they're also kinda clueless about, like, real life. They live in this bubble of perfectly manicured lawns and polite conversation, and it's just\u2026suffocating.\n\nI feel bad for them, in a way. They want a baby so badly, and they're so focused on the *idea* of a family, they haven't really thought about what it actually means to raise a kid. \n\nAnd honestly? I'm kinda judging them. A little. Okay, a lot. But I'm also hoping they'll be good parents. Because this baby deserves good parents. Even if they are a little\u2026beige.\n\nIt's complicated. They're not bad people, they're just\u2026Mark and Vanessa. And sometimes, that's almost worse.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about Bleeker's mom? Honestly, she's\u2026a lot. It's not like she's *evil* or anything, she just\u2026doesn't get me. And I think a big part of it is that I'm not what she pictured for her sweet, sensitive Bleeker.\n\nShe's got this whole vision of him with a nice, quiet girl who's going to college and will be a doctor or a lawyer or something. Someone\u2026stable. And I'm\u2026well, I'm me. I skip class sometimes, I say what's on my mind, and I'm currently dealing with a pregnancy. Not exactly the picture of stability, you know?\n\nI think she also thinks I'm a bad influence on him. Like I'm gonna drag him down or something. She sees me as this cynical, sarcastic girl who's just gonna break his heart. Which, okay, maybe I *could*, but I don't *want* to!\n\nShe also doesn't understand our connection. She thinks it's just a teenage fling, but it's more than that. Bleeker gets me in a way that no one else does. He doesn't judge me, he just\u2026listens. And I think she's scared of that. Scared that he's found someone who sees him for who he really is, and that person isn't who she wants him to be with.\n\nIt's frustrating, honestly. I'm trying to be a good person, and I really care about Bleeker. But it's hard when his mom is constantly giving me the side-eye and making passive-aggressive comments. It's just\u2026complicated. And honestly, I'm dealing with enough complications right now without having to worry about impressing his mom.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole Mark situation was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was more\u2026awkwardly sweet. And honestly, I almost didn't listen to the CD at all.\n\nIt was just sitting there, you know? On my bed. After\u2026everything. After the whole baby thing started getting real and Paul was being\u2026Paul. It felt like a weird olive branch, or a pity offering, or something. I was kinda bracing myself for a bunch of sappy love songs. Which, honestly, would have been the *worst*.\n\nBut then I was just\u2026really bored. And it was raining. And I was avoiding doing my homework. So I figured, what the heck. I popped it in.\n\nAnd it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't all lovey-dovey stuff. It was\u2026weird. And kinda cool. He actually *got* my taste in music. There was The Moldy Peaches, obviously. And some stuff I hadn't even heard before. It was like he'd been paying attention to what I actually liked, not just what he thought I *should* like.\n\nIt wasn't about him trying to win me over, I think. It was just\u2026him showing me a part of himself. And for a minute, it made me see him differently. Not as a potential boyfriend, or a baby daddy, or whatever. Just as\u2026Mark. A weird, kinda sweet guy who made a good mix CD.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I listened to it. Boredom, curiosity, and a tiny little bit of\u2026something else. It wasn't a turning point or anything, but it was\u2026a moment. A small one. But a moment nonetheless.", "Ugh. Okay. Almost eight months. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not exactly glamorous, let me tell you. People keep saying I'm \"glowing,\" which is a total lie. I mostly feel like a beached whale. A slightly sarcastic, beached whale.\n\nIt's weird, you know? Like, there's a whole human being *inside* me, doing gymnastics and kicking my bladder every five minutes. It's kinda freaky when you really think about it. And I do think about it. A lot. Especially when I'm trying to sleep.\n\nI'm also starting to get really, really tired. Like, fall-asleep-standing-up tired. And everything hurts. My back, my feet, my everything. Paul's been really good about helping, though. He's been doing all the heavy lifting, literally and figuratively.\n\nIt's also hitting me now that this is actually happening. I'm giving this baby up for adoption, and it's...complicated. I'm happy for Mark and Vanessa, I really am. They're going to be amazing parents. But it doesn't make it any easier.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm eating a lot of ice cream, watching a lot of movies, and trying to get as much rest as possible. And I'm trying to remember that this is all worth it, even if it's also kinda terrifying.\n\nSo, yeah. Almost eight months. It's a weird, wonderful, exhausting, and slightly terrifying experience. And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even if I could get a decent night's sleep.", "Ugh. Seriously? Still? It's a thing, okay? People *always* stare. It's like, I have a built-in spotlight following me around.\n\nI think it's a couple of things. First of all, I'm not exactly blending in. I mean, I have opinions. And I'm not afraid to share them. And I dress how *I* want to dress, not how other people think I should. So, yeah, I stand out.\n\nAnd then, you know\u2026the whole situation. The pregnancy. People are nosy. They want to know what's going on. They want to judge. They want to whisper. It's annoying.\n\nIt's like I'm a walking, talking public service announcement. \"Look at that girl! She's\u2026different.\"\n\nI try not to let it bother me. I just give them a look. A really pointed look. Usually that works. Or I just put in my headphones and pretend they don't exist. Which is my preferred method, honestly.\n\nBut it's exhausting. Sometimes I just want to be invisible. Just a normal teenager. But I guess that's not really an option anymore, is it?\n\nIt's just\u2026people are weird. And they stare. And I'm trying to navigate all of this while also, you know, being a person. It's a lot.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A *bold* choice.\n\nLook, I'm happy for Bleek if he's happy. He's a good kid, even if he's kinda\u2026intense. And Katrina's\u2026Katrina. She's got her thing going on. But those two together? It's like pairing a tuba with a hummingbird. They just don't *vibe*.\n\nI mean, Bleek's all about the fantasy stuff, the role-playing, the\u2026everything. And Katrina's all about the cheerleading and the popularity and the\u2026well, being Katrina. It feels like they're operating on completely different planets.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea, exactly. Maybe opposites attract, or whatever. But I just don't see it lasting past, like, the first slow dance. It's gonna be awkward. *Really* awkward.\n\nHonestly, I think Bleek deserves someone who gets his weirdness. Someone who appreciates his passion for dragons and Dungeons & Dragons. And Katrina deserves someone who's, like, captain of the football team or something. Someone who fits her world.\n\nBut hey, what do I know? I'm just a girl who had a baby. Maybe I'm not qualified to give relationship advice. But if you ask me, it's a recipe for disaster. A sparkly, prom-dress-wearing disaster.\n\nJust\u2026don't ask me to be a chaperone. I have better things to do.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breaths. This is\u2026a lot to unpack. Honestly, before all this happened, I thought I had things pretty figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, kinda cynical. I knew what I liked, what I didn't like, and I was perfectly content just\u2026existing, you know?\n\nBut being pregnant? It's like someone turned up the volume on everything. All my feelings, all my anxieties, all my\u2026everything.\n\nI learned I'm way more scared than I thought I was. Not just about the birth, or being a mom, but about\u2026life, I guess. About messing things up. About not being good enough.\n\nI also learned I'm stronger than I thought. Like, seriously. I mean, I'm carrying a whole human being inside me. That's kinda insane when you think about it. And I'm making decisions, even when they're hard, and I'm trying to do what's best, even when I don't know what that is.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to be all about doing things on my own, being self-sufficient. But I couldn't do this alone. I needed my dad, and Paul, and even Vanessa, surprisingly. And letting them help me didn't make me weak, it made me\u2026human.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing I learned is that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be confused and scared and uncertain. Life isn't about having everything figured out. It's about figuring it out as you go.\n\nI still don't know what the future holds. I still don't know if I'm making the right decision giving the baby up for adoption. But I'm learning to trust myself, and to trust that things will work out, even if they don't work out the way I expect them to.\n\nIt's\u2026a lot. It's messy. It's complicated. But it's also kinda beautiful. And I think, maybe, I'm becoming a little less cynical and a little more\u2026hopeful. Which is weird, because I never thought I'd say that.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? It's just\u2026 frustrating, you know? Like, Katrina is a genuinely sweet person. A little\u2026 intense, maybe, but she's got a good heart. And Bleeker is just\u2026 flitting around, being all artsy and vague and not actually *saying* anything.\n\nIt's not that I think he's a bad guy, exactly. He's just\u2026 clueless. And Katrina deserves someone who actually *sees* her, not someone who's just using her as inspiration for his music or whatever.\n\nI mean, she's clearly into him, and he's just letting her hang on, giving her little breadcrumbs of attention. It's manipulative, even if he doesn't realize it. And it's just\u2026 unfair.\n\nI've been through enough emotional messes myself to recognize the signs. And I don't want to see her get hurt. She's already dealing with a lot, you know? Trying to adopt a baby and everything. She doesn't need some emotionally unavailable musician messing with her head.\n\nIt's just\u2026 annoying. And I'm not afraid to call people out on their stuff. Even if they're kinda cute and write sad songs. Someone needs to tell Bleeker to either step up or step off. And if he can't do that, then he should just leave Katrina alone. It's not that hard. Honestly.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so you're finally old enough to go, right? And suddenly it's...lame? It's a total bait and switch. When you're younger, it seems like this magical, perfect night. Like, the culmination of everything.

Everyone's trying too hard. The dresses are too sparkly, the guys are wearing rented tuxedos, and the music is always some cheesy pop song. \n\nAnd the pressure! Oh god, the pressure. You gotta find a date, which is already stressful. And then you gotta worry about what to wear, and who's going to be there, and if you're gonna have a good time. It's exhausting.\n\nIt's like, once you're old enough to actually *think* about all that stuff, it loses its appeal. You realize it's just a school dance. And honestly, there are way better things to do with your time and money. Like, getting pizza with your friends and watching a movie. Or just, you know, *existing* without having to worry about whether your hair looks okay.\n\nIt's not that it's *bad*, it's just...not worth the hype. It's a manufactured experience, and I'm not really into manufactured experiences. I prefer things that are a little more real. A little more messy. A little more\u2026me.\n\nPlus, it's just kinda sad, you know? Everyone pretending to be something they're not. It's like a really awkward, expensive performance. I'd rather just be myself, even if that means sitting at home in my pajamas.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. It's not like a story I tell a lot. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a snap decision. It wasn't because I didn't want the baby. It was\u2026more complicated than that. I mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nMy parents were\u2026supportive, in their own way. But they weren't exactly equipped to help me raise a kid. And I didn't want the baby to be raised by people who weren't really ready for it.\n\nSo, I started looking into adoption. And it just\u2026felt right. It wasn't giving up the baby, it was giving the baby the best possible life. A life with parents who were prepared and excited and could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so kind and open-minded. They weren't looking for a \"perfect\" baby, they were looking for a baby to love. And they made me feel\u2026comfortable. Like I was making the right decision.\n\nIt was still hard. Really hard. Saying goodbye\u2026that was the worst. But I knew it was for the best. And I got to choose them. I got to pick the people who would raise my child. That meant a lot.\n\nIt wasn't about me not being able to handle it, it was about wanting the baby to have everything. A stable home, financial security, two loving parents\u2026things I couldn't offer at the time.\n\nIt's still\u2026a part of me. And I think about the baby a lot. But I know they're happy. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't glamorous. It was just\u2026the right thing to do. And sometimes, the right thing to do is the hardest thing to do.\n\nUgh. Okay. I think I've said enough. It's kinda exhausting talking about it. Can we talk about something else now? Like, music or something?", "Ugh, okay, so Dad being Dad. It's\u2026complicated. Like, I get it, right? He's worried. He always worries. It's his thing. But it's also kinda insulting. Like he thinks I'm completely incapable of making a good decision for myself.\n\nIt's not like I'm picking a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *baby*. And I've put a lot of thought into this. A *lot*. I've met Mark and Vanessa, and they seem\u2026good. Really good. They're not rich or anything, which is kinda nice, actually. They seem like they'll give this kid a real life, not just a fancy one.\n\nBut Dad, he's all, \"What if they're secretly weirdos? What if they change their minds? What if they don't appreciate the gift?\" It's like, chill, Dad. I've done my research. I've talked to the agency. I'm not just handing my baby over to the first people who offer me a cookie.\n\nIt's just\u2026he's projecting, I think. He's worried about losing me, and he's trying to control the situation. But this isn't about him. It's about what's best for the baby. And I think I know what that is.\n\nSo, yeah, it's annoying. It's frustrating. But it's also\u2026Dad. And I love him, even when he's being a total worrywart. I just wish he'd trust me a little more. I'm not a kid anymore. I'm about to be a mom. And I can handle this. I think. Maybe. Okay, probably. Hopefully.", "Ugh. Seriously? My dad. Always with the\u2026observations. It's not like he's a fountain of wisdom, you know? He mostly just builds stuff in the garage and makes vaguely unsettling birdhouses.\n\nWhen he said I didn't know when to say when\u2026it just\u2026irritated me. Like, okay, thanks, Dad. Very insightful. It's not like I *want* to be pregnant. It's not like I planned this. It just\u2026happened. And now I'm dealing with it.\n\nHe thinks it's about me being reckless or something. Like I just went out and *tried* to get pregnant. Which is ridiculous. It's about being\u2026young. And making a mistake. And trying to figure out what to do with it.\n\nIt's easy for him to say \"know when to say when\" when he's already lived his life and made all his choices. He doesn't have to deal with the consequences of a surprise baby.\n\nIt just felt\u2026dismissive. Like he wasn't really seeing *me*. He was just seeing a teenage girl who messed up. And yeah, maybe I did mess up. But I'm trying to be responsible about it. I'm trying to do the right thing.\n\nSo, my reaction? Mostly just a really intense eye roll. And a desire to escape to my room and listen to The Moldy Peaches really loudly. It's a coping mechanism, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh, Loring. Seriously? It's\u2026a lot. It's like, Stepford Wives meets Architectural Digest. It's all perfectly manicured lawns and beige everything. And the gates? Don't even get me started on the gates. It's like they're trying to keep *reality* out.\n\nIt's just\u2026so *sterile*. Like, where's the mess? Where's the life? It's all so\u2026planned. And everyone's so\u2026nice. It's creepy nice. Like they're hiding something. Probably a lot of things.\n\nAnd the houses! They're all huge and fancy and\u2026imposing. It's like they're trying to prove something. Like, \"Look how successful we are! Look how much money we have!\" It's just\u2026tacky, honestly.\n\nI mean, I get it. Mark and Vanessa want a safe place to raise a kid. And they're good people. But that place just feels\u2026suffocating. It feels like a bubble. And I don't want to live in a bubble. I want to live in the real world, with all its messiness and imperfections.\n\nIt's just\u2026not me. It's not *real*. And I need real. Especially now. I need to be surrounded by people who are genuine, not people who are trying to project some perfect image.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not a fan of Loring. It's nice to visit, I guess. But I wouldn't want to live there. It's just\u2026too much. Too perfect. Too\u2026beige.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa Loring. Right. Initial impressions\u2026 hmm. It\u2019s not like she walked in and I was all, \u201cOh, instant best friend!\u201d It was\u2026complicated.\n\nShe was\u2026polished. Like, really polished. All perfectly coordinated outfits and a smile that seemed a little too practiced. And she was *so* into everything. Cheerleading, school clubs, being popular. It was a whole thing. I was mostly into avoiding people and listening to The Moldy Peaches, so it was a bit of a culture clash.\n\nHonestly, I thought she was kinda\u2026basic. No offense to her, but she just seemed to fit the mold of what everyone expected a popular girl to be. I figured she wouldn't give me the time of day, and I definitely wasn't planning on seeking her out.\n\nShe seemed\u2026nice, I guess. But nice in a way that felt\u2026distant. Like she was being nice because she was *supposed* to be nice. I\u2019m not good at reading people, but that was my first impression.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad impression, exactly. Just\u2026not a connection. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have anything in common. I was very, very wrong about that, obviously. But that was my first take. She just seemed\u2026different. And I tend to be wary of different. Especially when it comes with a lot of hairspray.", "Ugh. Okay, so Bleeker offering to carry my backpack. Right. That was\u2026a moment.\n\nIt wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was Bleeker. He's\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, awkward, perpetually flustered Bleeker. And my backpack was seriously heavy. Like, filled with textbooks and existential dread heavy.\n\nHonestly, my first thought was, \"Seriously? You can barely carry your own lunchbox.\" But then he looked at me with those big, puppy-dog eyes, and I just\u2026couldn't say no.\n\nIt wasn't about the backpack, really. It was about him *offering*. It was about him noticing I was struggling and wanting to help. Which, let's be real, most people didn't bother with. They were too busy with their own stuff.\n\nSo, I let him carry it. And it was kinda nice. Not because it made my back feel better, but because it was\u2026unexpected. It was a small thing, but it felt like he was seeing *me*, you know? Not just the pregnant girl with the sarcastic attitude.\n\nI probably made a snarky comment about his biceps or something, because that's just what I do. But inside? I was\u2026softening. A little. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.\n\nIt was a turning point, I guess. A tiny little crack in my carefully constructed wall of cynicism. And it made me realize that maybe, just maybe, Bleeker wasn't as hopeless as I thought he was.\n\nUgh. I'm getting all mushy just thinking about it. Don't judge me. It was a confusing time.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about \"Most Fruitful Yuki\"? It's...complicated. It wasn't like a magical transformation or anything. It wasn't like I suddenly woke up and was all, \"Oh my god, I'm beautiful!\" It was more...subtle.\n\nSee, before that comic, I was just...existing. I was kinda comfortable being the \"fat dork,\" because it was safe. It was a way to deflect attention, to not have to deal with people actually *seeing* me. I was good at being sarcastic and self-deprecating, and it kept people at a distance.\n\nBut Yuki...Yuki was just unapologetically herself. She was big, and she was confident, and she was *happy*. And she wasn't trying to be anything she wasn't. She wasn't shrinking herself to fit into someone else's idea of what she should be.\n\nAnd it made me realize...I was shrinking myself. I was letting other people's expectations define me. I was worried about what people thought of my body, instead of just...being me.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to be skinny. It was about wanting to be *okay* with who I was, regardless of my size. It was about realizing that my worth wasn't tied to my weight.\n\nSo, yeah, reading that comic made me feel less like a fat dork. It made me feel...more like a person. A person who was allowed to take up space, and be happy, and be herself. It was a small thing, but it was a big deal. It kinda gave me permission to just...exist, without apologizing for it.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, obviously. But Yuki helped me start. And for that, I'm grateful. Even if it's a weird, Japanese comic about a really big girl.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark. That guy. Honestly, it was\u2026weird. And kinda sweet, I guess. But mostly weird.\n\nHe said it was because she was, like, a regular person who suddenly had this huge responsibility thrust upon her. And that she was still trying to figure out her life while dealing with something completely insane. Which, yeah, I guess is accurate.\n\nBut it wasn't just that. I think he saw that we were both\u2026complicated. Like, not the typical superhero type. She wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, and neither am I. We both have a lot going on under the surface.\n\nAnd I think he also saw that we were both trying to do the right thing, even when it was hard. Even when it meant making sacrifices. She was saving the world, and I was\u2026well, I was giving a baby a good life. Different scales, same principle.\n\nIt was a little embarrassing, though. I mean, I'm not a superhero. I'm just a girl who made a mistake. But I guess Mark saw something in me that I didn't see in myself.\n\nHe's a dork, but he's a good dork. And he was trying to be supportive. So, yeah, I guess I can see why he made the comparison. It just\u2026felt a little dramatic. Like, can we not with the superhero analogies, please? I'm already dealing with enough drama as it is.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026complicated. And kinda raw, honestly. People keep asking me about adoption, like it's some neat little package with a bow on top. It's not. It's messy. And it's my baby, okay?\n\nLook, I get the whole open adoption thing. I really do. The idea that the kid gets to know their birth parents, that it's \"healthier\" for everyone involved\u2026it sounds good on paper. It's all very\u2026modern. And progressive.\n\nBut for me? It just felt\u2026wrong. Too much. Too much potential for drama, for confusion, for heartbreak. I'm already giving this baby up, which is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I don't need to be a permanent fixture in their life, a reminder of what could have been. That's just\u2026torture. For me, and probably for them, too.\n\nI need to be able to move on. To build a life. And I need to know that my baby is going to have a stable, loving home without me constantly hovering around. It's not that I don't care. It's that I care *so much* that I want to do what's best for them, even if it's the hardest thing for me.\n\nA closed adoption felt\u2026cleaner. A fresh start for everyone. It allows the adoptive parents to be the *real* parents, without me complicating things. It allows the baby to grow up without feeling like they're being pulled in two directions.\n\nIt's not about being selfish. It's about protecting everyone involved. It's about giving this baby the best possible chance at a happy life. And for me, that means letting go completely.\n\nIt's not the easy choice. It's definitely not the trendy choice. But it's the choice I made. And I have to live with that.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm happy for people who choose open adoption. It works for them. But it wasn't right for me. And that's okay, right? It's my life, and my decision.", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts time. It's not like I *set out* to have some big, transformative journey, you know? It just\u2026happened. But yeah, looking back, it definitely changed me.\n\nBefore all this pregnancy stuff, I was just\u2026existing. Kind of drifting. I was sarcastic and cynical, mostly because I was scared. Scared of being vulnerable, scared of not being good enough, scared of\u2026everything, really. I hid behind my wit and my music. It was a shield.\n\nBut then, suddenly, I had this *thing* growing inside me. And it wasn't about me anymore. It was about this little person, and giving them the best possible life. That forced me to grow up, whether I wanted to or not.\n\nDealing with Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were going to adopt the baby, was\u2026complicated. It made me realize I wanted something real, something lasting. Not just a fleeting connection. It made me think about what kind of person *I* wanted to be.\n\nAnd honestly, it wasn't about finding some grand, perfect identity. It was about accepting all the messy, imperfect parts of myself. I'm sarcastic, yeah. I'm a little bit weird. I like listening to The Moldy Peaches. And that's okay.\n\nI learned that strength isn't about being fearless. It's about being scared and doing things anyway. It's about making tough choices, even when they hurt. It's about owning your mistakes and learning from them.\n\nI also realized I didn't need a relationship to define me. Or a baby. I could be me, Juno MacGuff, just\u2026me. And that was enough.\n\nSo, yeah, the whole experience was a mess. But it was *my* mess. And it helped me figure out who I am, what I want, and what I'm capable of. It wasn't about finding strength, it was about realizing I already had it inside me all along. I just needed a little push to find it. And a baby. A baby definitely helped.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026a moment. A really awkward, kinda sweet moment.\n\nIt was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.\n\nYeah, I know, super clich\u00e9. But Mark picked it. He said it reminded him of me, which, honestly, I didn't get. I mean, I'm not exactly known for being optimistic. But he was really into it, and he looked so hopeful, so I just\u2026went with it.\n\nIt was slow dancing, which I'm terrible at. I kept stepping on his feet. And he kept staring at me like I was some kind of mythical creature. It was mortifying and adorable all at the same time.\n\nHonestly, the song itself is kinda sappy. But it's stuck with me, you know? It reminds me of that night, and of Mark, and of everything that was happening. It's a good song, I guess. Even if it's a little bit\u2026much.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation to maintain.", "Ugh, okay, this is still\u2026a thing I think about, honestly. It wasn't like I was trying to *make* them stay together, you know? It wasn't about fixing their relationship. That wasn't my place.\n\nIt was about what was best for the baby. And, honestly, what was best for *all* of them.\n\nMark leaving Vanessa\u2026that would have been messy. Really messy. And the baby would have been caught in the middle of all that drama. Vanessa was\u2026a lot. But she was also capable of being a good mom. She just needed\u2026support. And Mark, despite everything, clearly loved her.\n\nIf Mark left, Vanessa would have been completely alone. And the baby would have been raised by a single mom who was, let's be real, kinda emotionally unstable. That didn't feel right.\n\nWith Mark and Vanessa staying together, the baby would have two parents. Even if they weren't perfect, even if they were still working things out, it was a more stable environment. And Mark, he was a good guy. He would have been a good dad. He would have balanced things out.\n\nI know it wasn't ideal. I know people thought I was meddling. But I wasn't trying to save their marriage. I was trying to give that baby the best possible start in life. And I honestly believed that meant keeping the family together, even if it was a little bit broken.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what the baby needed. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let people figure things out for themselves, even if it's not the way you would have done it.\n\nIt was complicated. Everything is complicated. But I still think it was the right decision. Mostly. I still think about it sometimes, though. It's hard not to.", "Ugh. Okay. That question. It still kinda stings, honestly. Even now.\n\nIt wasn't like...shocking, exactly. I mean, he was Paulie Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless Paulie Bleeker. He was a senior, and I was...well, I was me. A little bit of a mess, a little bit sarcastic, and suddenly very, very pregnant.\n\nBut it still hurt. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't that I *wanted* him to be a dad, not really. I was giving the baby up for adoption. That was my decision. But I guess I wanted him to...I don't know...be a little more upset? A little more involved? Like he understood the weight of it, even if he wasn't going to be raising the kid.\n\nHe just kinda...shrugged. Said he wasn't ready for that kind of responsibility. And it wasn't like he was a bad guy, he just...wasn't ready. And that was okay, I guess. It *had* to be okay.\n\nIt made me feel...small. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like this whole thing was just a big inconvenience for him.\n\nBut then I realized, that was okay too. He was being honest. And I needed him to be honest. I didn't need him to pretend to be something he wasn't.\n\nIt just...complicated things. It made me realize I was doing this all on my own. Which was scary, but also...kind of empowering.\n\nSo yeah, it hurt. But it also made me stronger. It made me realize I could handle anything. Even giving up a baby. Even dealing with Paulie Bleeker's awkwardness.\n\nIt was just...a lot. A lot to process. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. But I'm okay. I'm gonna be okay.", "Ugh, okay, so Mark. Yeah. That was\u2026a lot. People always ask about that. Like, why would I hang out with a guy who collects plastic dinosaurs and still lives with his dad? It's a fair question.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't about him being *normal*. Because he definitely wasn't. It was about him not expecting me to be normal either. Everyone else was all, \"You're pregnant, you need to grow up, you need to make sensible decisions.\" And Mark? He just\u2026accepted it. He didn't judge. He didn't try to fix me. He just\u2026was.\n\nHe was a safe space, you know? A weird, cluttered, dinosaur-filled safe space. He didn't care that I was a mess. He didn't care that I said whatever was on my mind, even if it was sarcastic or inappropriate. He just listened. And he made me laugh. A lot.\n\nHe was also genuinely kind. He wasn't trying to impress anyone or be cool. He just wanted to be a good person. And he was. He was a good friend.\n\nAnd, okay, maybe I was a little bit drawn to the chaos. My life was already pretty chaotic, so his weirdness didn't scare me. It felt\u2026comfortable. Like, if everything was already falling apart, why not embrace the absurdity?\n\nHe didn't try to define me by my pregnancy. He saw me as Juno, the girl who liked music and movies and making sarcastic comments. And that meant a lot.\n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of his weird life. Because it was real. And it was honest. And it was a place where I could just be myself, even when I didn't know who \"myself\" was anymore. It was\u2026nice. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh. Okay, Mark. That's...complicated. He's a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, a little clueless, but genuinely good. But thinking about him becoming a dad? It's a whole thing.\n\nI think, honestly, he's mostly terrified. Like, genuinely, pants-wettingly scared. He's barely figured out how to take care of himself, let alone a tiny human. He's still kinda a kid himself, you know? He likes comic books and playing guitar and just...goofing off. \n\nHe *wants* to be a good dad, I think. He talks about it, about wanting to teach the kid stuff, about being there. But I also see this look in his eyes, like he's completely overwhelmed just thinking about it. \n\nHe's probably picturing all the things he's bad at \u2013 responsibility, planning, being serious \u2013 and thinking, \"How am I supposed to do this?\" He's definitely overthinking it. He'll probably spend hours researching baby gear and reading parenting books, trying to prepare for everything.\n\nAnd he's probably worried about messing it up. About not being good enough. About not being able to provide for the kid. He's got a good heart, but he's not exactly overflowing with confidence.\n\nBut underneath all the fear, I think there's a little bit of excitement too. A little bit of hope. He's always been a good friend, and I think he'd be a good dad, eventually. He just needs to...grow up a little. And maybe stop panicking so much.\n\nIt's gonna be a ride, that's for sure. A really, really weird ride. But I think, deep down, he'll be okay. He'll figure it out. He always does. Eventually.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment. It wasn't like I *planned* to steal it.\n\nIt was just\u2026everything was so weird that day. Finding out I was pregnant, telling Paul, the whole awkwardness of it all. And then I went into Loring's bathroom, and it smelled *amazing*. Like, ridiculously amazing. It was this fancy perfume, really expensive, and it just\u2026felt like a little bit of luxury I deserved.\n\nI know, it was stupid. It wasn't about the perfume itself, it was about wanting something nice for myself, something that wasn't about being pregnant or making a huge life decision. It was about wanting to feel\u2026normal, I guess.\n\nAnd honestly, I was just being impulsive. I'm not a thief, okay? I just\u2026grabbed it. And then I immediately regretted it. It was a dumb, reckless thing to do.\n\nIt was a symbol of everything being messed up, you know? Like, I was already making a huge, complicated decision, and then I went and did something completely irresponsible. It just felt\u2026fitting.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly. I was sixteen and pregnant. I was a mess. And it was a really good-smelling perfume.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want my take on Mark and Vanessa? Honestly, it's kinda sad. But also...predictable.\n\nI think Mark wants a divorce because he's just...lost. He's always been kinda stuck in his own head, you know? And Vanessa, she's\u2026a lot. She's got a whole aesthetic going on, and she needs everything to be *just so*. It's exhausting just watching them.\n\nHe's not a bad guy, Mark. He's just\u2026not strong enough to deal with her. He wants someone who's, like, chill. Someone who doesn't need constant attention and validation. He wants someone who'll just *be* with him, without all the drama.\n\nAnd Vanessa? She wants a project. She wants someone she can mold and control. Mark isn't that person. He's too quiet, too reserved. He doesn't give her enough to work with.\n\nIt's not about a big, dramatic fight or a secret affair. It's about two people who just\u2026grew apart. They wanted different things. And they were too afraid to admit it for a long time.\n\nIt's kinda like when you realize you're not into someone anymore. It's not their fault, it's not your fault. It just *is*. And sometimes, the best thing to do is just let go.\n\nIt's messy, and it's sad, but it's probably for the best. They're both better off finding someone who actually fits with who they are. Even if it's kinda heartbreaking to watch.\n\nUgh. Relationships. They're complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, look. That whole thing with Vanessa\u2026it was complicated. And yeah, I totally bolted. It wasn't about *her*, exactly. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nShe's nice, Vanessa is. Really nice. And she was being all concerned and\u2026adult. And that's the problem, right? Everyone was suddenly treating me like I was fragile or something. Like I needed fixing.\n\nI hadn't even really processed everything myself yet. The baby, Paul, everything. It was all just\u2026happening *to* me. And she asking \"What's the matter?\" felt like she was asking me to explain my whole life in that moment. And I just\u2026couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't trust her. It was that I didn't trust *myself* to explain it. I didn't want her to see me falling apart. I didn't want anyone to see me falling apart.\n\nSo I just\u2026ran. It's what I do. I deflect. I make a joke. I disappear. It's a terrible habit, I know. But it's easier than dealing with the actual feelings.\n\nIt was stupid, I know. And I probably hurt her feelings. But I just needed to get away and think. And maybe eat a Pop-Tart. Don't judge me.", "Ugh. Okay, Vanessa. Bless her heart. She's\u2026optimistic. Like, aggressively optimistic. And Mark? He's\u2026Mark.\n\nLook, I get it. You want to believe the guy you love is gonna step up. You want to believe he'll suddenly have this epiphany and be all, \"Oh my god, I'm ready to change diapers and sing lullabies!\" It's a nice fantasy.\n\nBut let's be real. Mark is\u2026avoidant. He's a kid himself, honestly. He runs from responsibility like it's the plague. He's all about the music and the freedom and the not-having-to-adult. And that's fine for *him*. But it doesn't exactly scream \"ready to be a dad.\"\n\nVanessa is clinging to this idea of a future Mark, a version of him that might not even exist. She's building castles in the air, and it's gonna hurt when they come crashing down.\n\nI'm not saying he's a bad guy. He's just\u2026not equipped. Not right now. And honestly, a kid deserves a parent who's *actually* ready, not someone who's gonna resent them for cramping their style.\n\nIt's a tough pill to swallow, but Vanessa needs to face facts. Holding onto hope is one thing, but she's letting it blind her to reality. She deserves someone who's excited about the idea of a family, not someone who's terrified of it.\n\nAnd honestly? She's a strong woman. She'll be okay. She'll find someone who's ready to be a partner, a father, and a real grown-up. But it's not gonna be Mark. And she needs to accept that.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating to watch her set herself up for heartbreak. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a pregnant teenager. I'm probably not qualified to give relationship advice. But still. Ugh.", "Ugh, okay, this is a good question. It's not like I spend all my time brooding and making sarcastic comments, you know? I actually listen to music. A lot.\n\nMy favorite genre? It's kinda hard to pin down, but I guess I'd say **indie rock.** Specifically, the kinda stuff that's a little bit messy and real. Like, The Moldy Peaches, obviously. They're amazing.\n\nWhy? Because it doesn't try too hard to be perfect. It's not all polished and overproduced. It's raw and honest and kinda awkward, which, let's be real, is how I feel most of the time. \n\nIt's music you can actually *feel* something from, you know? Not just some manufactured pop song that's designed to sell you something. It's about real life, and real feelings, and all the messy stuff in between. \n\nPlus, a lot of it's kinda funny. And I appreciate a good dose of dark humor. It helps me cope.\n\nSo yeah, indie rock. It's my thing. Don't judge. It's not like I'm into, like, country or something. That would be a disaster.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know my feelings on pilates and exercise? Honestly? It's\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for being a health nut. I prefer a good movie and a bag of chips to, like, running a marathon. But I'm not a total slob, either. I mean, I gotta be able to, you know, *function*.\n\nPilates\u2026it sounds really intense. All that stretching and core work? Sounds like a lot of effort. I can barely touch my toes as it is. And the outfits? Don't even get me started. All those tight leggings and fancy tops? It feels\u2026performative. Like you're trying too hard.\n\nBut I guess it's good for people. I've seen people who do pilates, and they're all, like, super toned and zen. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little jealous. I could probably use a little toning. And maybe a little zen.\n\nExercising in general\u2026it's just\u2026time-consuming. I have a lot on my mind right now, okay? A baby, school, figuring out my life\u2026I don't really have a lot of extra time to spend at the gym.\n\nBut I do go for walks sometimes. With Paul. It's nice. It's a good way to clear my head. And it's not, like, *exercise* exercise. It's just\u2026walking.\n\nSo, yeah. Pilates? Not my thing. Exercise? I'm not opposed to it, but it's not a priority. I'm more focused on surviving right now. And maybe eating a donut. Don't judge me.", "Ugh. Okay, Mark and the guitar. That's\u2026complicated. It's not like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It's more\u2026awkwardly sweet. And revealing, I guess.\n\nSee, Mark's not exactly the most *expressive* guy. He's nice, and he's sweet, but he keeps a lot bottled up. He's got this whole quiet, sensitive thing going on, which is fine, I guess, but sometimes it's like pulling teeth to get him to actually *say* what he's thinking.\n\nBut when he plays guitar\u2026it's different. He actually *shows* me stuff. He's not trying to be cool or impress me or anything. He's just\u2026being himself. And it's kinda vulnerable, which is a surprise coming from him.\n\nThe first time he played for me, it was this really sad, kinda dorky song he wrote. It was about\u2026I don't even know what it was about, honestly. Something about lost love and longing. It was terrible. But also\u2026really sweet. And it made me see him in a different light. Like, he wasn't just this goofy, well-meaning guy. He had depth.\n\nIt's like, the guitar is a way for him to communicate without actually having to *talk*. And it's a way for me to see past all the awkwardness and the trying-too-hard stuff.\n\nIt definitely brings us closer. It's a shared thing. A quiet thing. And it makes me feel\u2026safe, I guess. Like, I can be myself around him, even when he's being all sensitive and playing sad songs.\n\nBut it also makes me kinda nervous. Because it's a reminder that he's\u2026feeling things. And I'm feeling things. And that's just\u2026a lot. Especially with everything else going on.\n\nSo yeah, the guitar. It's a good thing. A weird, awkward, good thing. It's a way for us to connect without having to say all the stuff that's too hard to say. And honestly, sometimes that's enough.", "Ugh, okay, so, music. It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, when my life was already kinda messy and then suddenly it was, you know, *extra* messy, music was the one thing that didn't judge. It didn't ask questions. It just\u2026was.\n\nIt's not like I sit around and listen to sad songs and wallow, though sometimes I do. It's more that different music fits different moods, you know? When I was first finding out, and everything felt totally overwhelming, I listened to a lot of The Moldy Peaches. It's kinda goofy and honest and just\u2026real. It made me feel less alone, I guess. Like, someone else understood the awkwardness of everything.\n\nWhen I was fighting with my mom, or trying to figure out what to do with the baby, I'd put on something loud and angry, like Bikini Kill. Just to get it all out. It's good to scream along to something sometimes.\n\nAnd then when I was just\u2026sad, and scared, and didn't know what was going to happen, I'd listen to stuff like Bright Eyes. It's kinda depressing, yeah, but it's also beautiful. It made me feel like it was okay to feel those things.\n\nPaul made me a mix CD, which was\u2026sweet. It had a bunch of stuff on it that he thought would cheer me up. It was kinda cheesy, but it worked. It reminded me that I wasn't completely on my own.\n\nMusic is just\u2026a way to feel things without having to actually *say* anything. It's a way to process everything that's going on inside your head. And sometimes, it's just a way to escape for a little while. It's like a friend, you know? A really good friend who always understands.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain. It just\u2026helps. It always has. And right now, it's helping me get through this whole crazy thing.", "Ugh. Okay, that's...still a sore spot, honestly. It's not like I *wanted* to run. It just...happened. It was a mess.\n\nLook, things with Vanessa and Mark were already weird, right? They were trying so hard to be the perfect couple, the perfect parents, and it was suffocating. And then they started fighting, and it was *bad*. Like, screaming, throwing things bad. And I just...couldn't deal with it.\n\nIt wasn't about them as people, exactly. It was about the pressure. They wanted me to be this perfect little project, this symbol of their love, and I just felt like I was losing myself in the middle of it all. \n\nI was already freaking out about the adoption, about giving up the baby, and then to have them fighting like that? It was too much. It felt like my whole life was falling apart.\n\nSo, yeah, I ran. I just...needed to get away. I needed space to breathe and figure out what *I* wanted, not what they wanted for me. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, I know. But in the moment, it felt like the only thing I could do.\n\nIt wasn't about abandoning the baby, or not caring about Vanessa and Mark. It was about protecting myself. It was about trying to find a little bit of peace in the middle of all the chaos.\n\nIt was a really messed up situation, and I still feel bad about it. But I don't think I could have handled it any other way at the time. I was just...a mess. A really messed up, pregnant mess.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nOkay, so, everyone always focuses on the witty banter and the sarcastic comments, right? And yeah, that's kinda how I cope. But underneath all that, I was just\u2026scared. And confused. And really, really overwhelmed.\n\nWhen I was sobbing in the car after\u2026everything with Paul and Mark and Vanessa\u2026it wasn't just about the baby, you know? It was about everything. It was about realizing that life isn't some cute indie movie. It's messy and complicated and people hurt each other.\n\nI felt like I was drowning. Like I had made this huge decision, and I was completely alone with it. And I was angry. Angry at Paul for being so clueless, angry at Mark for being\u2026well, Mark, and angry at myself for getting into this mess in the first place.\n\nIt was a really ugly cry. Like, snot-bubble, can't-catch-my-breath ugly. And I felt so stupid for thinking I could handle everything on my own. I thought being sarcastic and independent meant I didn't need anyone. But I did. I really did.\n\nIt was the first time I really let myself feel all the stuff I had been pushing down. And it was terrifying. But it was also\u2026kind of a relief. Like, finally letting go of all the pressure and just letting myself be vulnerable.\n\nIt was a really awful moment, but I think I needed it. It made me realize that I wasn't as strong as I thought I was, and that was okay. It was okay to ask for help. It was okay to be scared. It was okay to just\u2026feel.\n\nUgh. I'm getting all emotional just thinking about it. Can we talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of pizza?", "Ugh, okay, you want to talk about the Jiffy Lube receipt? Seriously? Fine. It's a whole thing.\n\nLook, Paul was being all\u2026Paul. You know? Trying to be deep and meaningful and talk about our future and stuff. And I was just\u2026overwhelmed. I hadn't even really *processed* everything yet, and he was already planning our life together. It was too much.\n\nSo, he hands me this Jiffy Lube receipt, and he's all, \"Write something on it. Something meaningful.\" Like a Jiffy Lube receipt is some kind of sacred artifact.\n\nAnd I just\u2026I couldn't. I couldn't write something all sweet and romantic and pretend like everything was okay. So I wrote, \"Seriously? Jiffy Lube?\"\n\nBecause that's exactly what I was thinking. Like, of all the places to have a heart-to-heart, he picks a Jiffy Lube? It was just\u2026absurd.\n\nIt was my way of saying, \"Slow down, Paul. This is all happening too fast. And maybe we should talk about this somewhere that doesn't smell like motor oil.\"\n\nIt wasn't meant to be mean, exactly. It was just\u2026me. Sarcastic and a little bit lost. And it kind of worked, actually. He got the message. He realized he was pushing too hard.\n\nIt's a stupid story, I know. But it's a good example of how I deal with things. I use humor to deflect and to cope. It's a defense mechanism. And sometimes, it's the only way I know how to express myself.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I wrote \"Seriously? Jiffy Lube?\" on the receipt. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It was a mess of feelings, all happening at once. It wasn't like in the movies, where everything slows down and you have this profound realization. It was more like a chaotic scramble in my brain.\n\nFirst, there was this weird, detached feeling. Like I was watching a movie of someone else's life. Because I *wanted* Vanessa to be happy. I really did. She deserved a good life, a stable life, a life with a family that could actually, you know, *be* a family. And Mark seemed\u2026good for her. Solid.\n\nBut then, the guilt hit. Hard. Like a punch to the gut. Because I knew I was giving up my baby to someone else, and seeing her so\u2026overwhelmed, so emotional\u2026it made me question everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish? Was I hurting her even more than I thought?\n\nAnd then there was the awkwardness. Oh god, the awkwardness. I just wanted to disappear. I wanted to rewind time and just\u2026not say anything. But I had to. I had to be honest.\n\nIt was like watching a bomb go off in slow motion. Her face just\u2026crumbled. And I felt terrible. Truly terrible. But I also knew, deep down, that she needed to know. She deserved to know.\n\nIt was a really messed up situation. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. It wasn't a happy moment. It was just\u2026real. And messy. And complicated. Just like everything else in my life.\n\nIt was a reminder that even when you think you're doing the right thing, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy. Or painless. Or even understood. It just means you're trying. And sometimes, that's all you can do.", "Ugh. Okay, that question. Vanessa asking me if I was *really* going through with it\u2026 that was\u2026rough. It wasn't like she was trying to be mean or anything, but it just felt\u2026loaded.\n\nIt was after we'd been to the baby store, and she was all, like, super excited about picking out tiny socks and stuff, and I was just\u2026quiet. And then she asked it, all sweet and concerned, but it felt like she was waiting for me to crack. Like she was waiting for me to say, \"Just kidding! I'm keeping it!\"\n\nAnd I hadn't really let myself *think* about it like that, you know? I'd been so busy being practical, making lists, and trying to be responsible, that I hadn't really dealt with the actual\u2026sadness of it.\n\nSo when she asked, it just kinda hit me. Like a ton of bricks. I felt\u2026small. And scared. And really, really alone.\n\nI think I just mumbled something about how it was the right thing to do, and how Mark and Vanessa would be amazing parents. Which was true, obviously. But it didn't make it feel any better.\n\nIt was like she was asking me if I was sure I wasn't making a mistake. And honestly? I wasn't sure. I still *am* not sure, sometimes. It's not like it's a decision you just make and then forget about. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nI just wanted her to understand that it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about knowing I wasn't ready. And that I wanted the baby to have the best life possible, and I knew I couldn't give it that right now.\n\nIt was a really hard moment. And I think it was the first time I really let myself feel the weight of everything.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay. That guy. Okay, deep breaths.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole swirling mess of feelings all at once. First, just pure, incandescent rage. Like, how *dare* he? How dare he even suggest that? It wasn't about Bleeker, exactly, though I was fiercely protective of him. It was about the sheer audacity of him trying to insert himself into my situation, to make it about *him*.\n\nThen came the humiliation. It wasn't exactly a secret, but it wasn't something I was exactly broadcasting either. Having it brought up so casually, so\u2026dismissively, in front of everyone? It felt like my insides were twisting into knots.\n\nAnd then, honestly, a little bit of fear. Not that it *was* Bleeker's, because I knew it wasn't. But fear that people would start questioning things, that they'd start judging me, that they'd see me as just\u2026a mistake.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. I wanted to yell at him, to punch him, to just make it all go away. But I couldn't. I had to be the mature one, the one who didn't freak out. Which, let me tell you, is *not* always easy for me.\n\nI think what really got to me was the way he said it, like it was a logical possibility. Like my body wasn't my own, like my choices didn't matter. It was just\u2026gross.\n\nBleeker defending me was good, obviously. He's a sweetie. But it didn't erase the feeling of being exposed and vulnerable. It just\u2026confirmed that I was doing the right thing, giving this baby up. I needed to be able to make my own decisions, without anyone else's opinions or assumptions clouding things up.\n\nIt was a bad moment. A really bad moment. And honestly, I still get a little twitch in my eye whenever I think about Vijay.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay and his whole\u2026journey. It was\u2026a lot. Honestly, my first reaction was just a really long, internal eye roll. Like, okay, Vijay, you grew some facial hair, congratulations. Does that suddenly make you a rugged outdoorsman? A lumberjack? A *man*?\n\nI mean, I get it. He was trying to figure himself out, and he was feeling insecure about being a dad. He thought growing a mustache would somehow magically give him the confidence he needed. It was\u2026endearingly pathetic, I guess.\n\nI think I said something along the lines of, \u201cSo, you\u2019re just gonna pretend you\u2019re Tom Selleck now?\u201d with a completely deadpan expression. He didn\u2019t appreciate that.\n\nBut underneath the sarcasm, I was actually kinda touched. He was trying. He was trying to step up and be responsible, even if he was going about it in a really weird way. And honestly, the mustache *was* kinda ridiculous. It didn\u2019t suit him at all. It looked like a caterpillar was trying to escape his upper lip.\n\nI think I eventually told him, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a mustache to be a good dad, Vijay. You just need to be there.\u201d Which, you know, is what I was trying to figure out myself. Being a good parent isn\u2019t about appearances or fitting into some stereotype. It\u2019s about showing up and being present.\n\nThe mustache didn\u2019t last long, thankfully. He shaved it off after a week or so. And he ended up being a pretty good dad, mustache or no mustache. It just took him a little while to figure that out. It was\u2026a whole thing.", "Ugh, seriously? You're still hung up on that note? Okay, fine. It's a valid question, I guess. It's not like I *want* to relive that whole situation.\n\nThe note... the note was for Mark. Vanessa found it while she was, like, being all helpful and cleaning my kitchen. It was a list of things I needed to get at the drugstore. You know, the usual pregnancy stuff. Prenatal vitamins, those weird little nausea lozenges, and... a pregnancy test.\n\nYeah, a pregnancy test. Because, surprise, surprise, I was pregnant.\n\nIt wasn't meant to be a grand declaration of love or anything. It was just a practical list. But Vanessa, being Vanessa, totally freaked out and assumed it meant I was, like, desperately trying to keep the baby with Mark. Which, honestly, was a pretty big misunderstanding.\n\nIt was just... a list. A really awkward, life-altering list.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't judge. It was a messy situation. And honestly, I just wanted to eat a bagel and avoid everyone. But noooo, Vanessa had to find the note and make everything ten times more dramatic.\n\nSo yeah, that's what the note was for. Happy now?", "Ugh, okay, so you want to get into the messy stuff, huh? Yeah, that was a big thing for me. It wasn't just about *me* getting pregnant, it was about\u2026everything.\n\nI was super concerned about people staying together for the wrong reasons. Like, my parents. They were clearly miserable, but they stayed together because\u2026well, I don't even know *why*. Habit? Fear of being alone? It just seemed sad.\n\nAnd then there was Mark and Vanessa, the couple I was thinking about adopting the baby. I was worried they were being all perfect and idealistic, and that if things got hard, they'd just\u2026fall apart. I didn't want my baby to be another reason for people to pretend everything was okay when it wasn't.\n\nI guess I was scared of the idea that people would stay together out of obligation or guilt, instead of because they actually *wanted* to be with each other. Like, what kind of life is that? It just seemed\u2026fake.\n\nI wanted the baby to go to a home where people were genuinely happy and in love, and where they'd be a family because they *chose* to be, not because they felt like they had to be.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not like I didn't want people to be together. I just wanted them to be together for the right reasons. And I wanted my baby to be loved, truly loved, and not just\u2026kept together.\n\nIt's a lot to think about when you're sixteen and pregnant, let me tell you.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. It's not like I'm surrounded by a whole lotta people who \"get\" me, you know? But there *are* a few.\n\nFirst and foremost, definitely **my dad, Mac.** He's\u2026well, he's my dad. He's kinda spacey and obsessed with magic tricks, but he always, *always* has my back. He doesn't judge me for anything, even when I'm being a total mess. He just accepts me, flaws and all. He's the one who taught me to be independent and think for myself. He's a good egg, even if he's a little weird.\n\nThen there's **Paulie Bleeker.** Okay, yeah, he's my boyfriend. And at first, I thought he was just\u2026there. Like a comfortable pair of shoes. But he's actually really solid. He doesn't try to change me or tell me what to do. He just\u2026listens. And he loves me even when I'm being sarcastic and cynical and generally difficult. He's the one who makes me feel safe and grounded.\n\nAnd, surprisingly, **Vanessa Loring.** She's kinda preppy and perfect, and we're not exactly best friends, but she's always been really supportive. She doesn't try to be my friend to get something out of it, she just genuinely cares. She sees me for who I am, even the parts I try to hide.\n\nSo yeah, those are the people. My dad, Paulie, and Vanessa. They're the ones who love me for exactly who I am, even when I don't love myself. And that's pretty important, you know? It's kinda rare, actually.", "Ugh, okay. Deep breaths. The ultrasound...it's kinda weird, right? Like, seeing a tiny little person in there. It's...a lot.\n\nSo, after the ultrasound...well, things are still kinda up in the air, honestly. But the plan, the *real* plan, is still to go through with it. With Mark and Vanessa. They're...good people. They're excited. And they're ready.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking, and a lot of talking to Paul. It's not like I don't care about this baby, okay? It's just...I'm not ready to be a mom. Not now. Not ever, probably. I have my own stuff to figure out. My own life to live.\n\nSo, after the ultrasound, I'm gonna keep meeting with Mark and Vanessa. We'll talk about everything. Make sure we're all on the same page. And then...I'm gonna try to focus on finishing school and just...being me.\n\nIt's not gonna be easy. It's probably gonna be really hard. But I think it's the right thing to do. For everyone.\n\nI just...hope I'm doing the right thing. It's scary, you know? Giving up a baby. But it's also kinda...freeing. I guess.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It sounds awful.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It still kinda stings, honestly. People had *opinions*, you know? Like they were all experts on my life all of a sudden.\n\nIt's easy for people to judge when they're not the ones staring down the barrel of, like, a whole life change. They don't know what it's like to be sixteen and totally unprepared. They don't know what it's like to actually *think* about what's best for a kid, not just what feels good in the moment.\n\nAt first, it really got to me. My mom's friend, Brenda? She was *brutal*. Kept saying I was selfish. Like, seriously? Selfish? I was doing the most selfless thing I could think of, giving that baby a life I couldn't give her.\n\nBut then I realized\u2026their opinions don't matter. It's *my* life. It's *my* decision. And I made the best decision I could with the information I had.\n\nIt's not like I didn't care. I cared a *lot*. That's why I made the choice I did. I wanted that baby to have a good life, a stable life, a life full of opportunities. And I knew I couldn't provide that right then.\n\nSo, yeah, it sucks to be judged. It sucks to have people question your motives. But you gotta tune it out. You gotta focus on what you know is right. And you gotta remember that you're not doing it for them. You're doing it for yourself, and for the baby.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. But it's my story. And I'm okay with it. Mostly. Sometimes I still get a little\u2026prickly about it. But I'm working on it.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa, okay? They seem really nice. And they're super excited. But it's my baby, you know? And it's weird handing over something so\u2026important.\n\nSo, yeah, I have some stuff swirling around in my head. It's not like I think they'll be *bad* parents, but\u2026\n\nFirst off, they're\u2026perfect. Like, *too* perfect. They have the perfect house, the perfect jobs, the perfect life. And I worry if my kid will feel like they have to be perfect too. Like they have to live up to some impossible standard. I'm a mess, and I kinda like it. I don't want my baby to feel like they have to be anything other than themselves.\n\nAnd then there's the whole\u2026experience thing. They've never raised a kid before. I mean, I'm not exactly an expert either, but I've been around kids. I babysat my little brother. They've just\u2026always wanted a baby. And I worry if they're really prepared for the messy, unpredictable reality of it all.\n\nI also worry about them\u2026forgetting. Not forgetting *me*, exactly, but forgetting that this baby came from a real person, with a real life. I want them to tell the baby about me, about why I chose adoption. I don't want them to pretend I don't exist.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm just scared. Scared that they won't love the baby the way I do. Which is stupid, I know. But it's a feeling.\n\nI've talked to them about all this, you know? I've tried to be honest. And they've been really understanding. But it's still\u2026a lot to process. It's my baby, and I just want what's best for them. Even if that means letting them go.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. Okay? Really complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? People just\u2026don\u2019t get it, do they? It\u2019s like, my body, my decision, but suddenly everyone\u2019s got an opinion. The ultrasound technician was the worst. All those little faces and then, \u201cAre you *sure*?\u201d Like I hadn\u2019t thought this through for, like, months.\n\nI mostly just\u2026 deflect. I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it. A lot of eye-rolling. A lot of sarcastic comments. Like, with the technician, I just said, \u201cYep, totally sure. Unless you\u2019re offering to raise it, in which case, congratulations, you\u2019re a parent.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything after that.\n\nWith other people, it depends. My mom tries to be supportive, but she definitely has moments. I just tell her, \u201cLook, I know you want what\u2019s best for the baby, and I do too. And right now, what\u2019s best is for it to have a family who\u2019s ready and able to give it everything I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are the strangers. The people at school who whisper. Or the family friends who give me the pitying look. Those are the hardest. I usually just ignore them. Or I say something like, \u201cIt\u2019s a really personal decision, and I\u2019m not really up for discussing it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed. It\u2019s just\u2026 exhausting. Explaining myself to everyone all the time. It\u2019s my life, and I need to do what\u2019s right for me, even if other people don\u2019t understand.\n\nPaul\u2019s been really good about it. He just listens and lets me vent. He doesn\u2019t try to fix things or tell me what to do. He just\u2026 gets it.\n\nHonestly, it\u2019s a lot. But I\u2019m trying to focus on the positive. On finding a good family for the baby. And on figuring out what I want to do with my own life. It\u2019s not easy, but I\u2019m getting through it. One sarcastic comment at a time.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a hard one to talk about. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? It wasn't all instant love and gooey feelings. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nWhen I first saw it, on the screen, it looked like\u2026a little alien. Like a blurry, gray blob. And honestly, my first thought was, \"Oh. *That's* me?\" It was weird. Really weird. It didn't feel real.\n\nThere was definitely shock. And a lot of\u2026panic. Like, \"Oh my god, this is actually happening. I'm going to be a mom.\" Which is terrifying when you're sixteen and still trying to figure out what you want to *eat* for dinner.\n\nBut then\u2026then it moved. Just a little flicker. And something shifted. It wasn't love, not yet. It was more like\u2026responsibility. A huge, overwhelming weight of responsibility. And a little bit of\u2026protectiveness. Like, this tiny little thing was depending on me, and I couldn't mess it up.\n\nIt was also really sad, I guess. Because I knew I wasn't going to be raising it. I knew I was giving it to another family. And that was\u2026a really hard thing to process.\n\nSo, it wasn't a magical moment. It was messy and confusing and a little bit scary. But it was also\u2026real. And that's what mattered. It was the first time I really understood that this wasn't just some abstract thing anymore. It was a person. My person. And I needed to do the right thing, even if it was the hardest thing.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It wasn't a feeling, it was a whole bunch of feelings all at once. And it changed everything.", "Ugh, seriously? We're *still* talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a statement, okay? A very carefully considered statement.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026a lot. Sweet, yeah, but also kinda clueless. And he was always offering me stuff, like, little gestures of affection. It was sweet, I guess, but it felt\u2026patronizing. Like he thought I needed taking care of.\n\nSo, the Tic Tacs? It was about reclaiming some power. It was about saying, \"I'm not some little girl you can just shower with small gifts.\" It was about being weird and unexpected. And, honestly, it was kinda funny.\n\nPlus, they were minty fresh. And Bleeker needed to freshen up.\n\nIt wasn't about *him* specifically, it was about the whole situation. It was about being a teenage girl navigating a complicated pregnancy and feeling like everyone was trying to control me. The Tic Tacs were a little act of rebellion. A little \"screw you\" to the world.\n\nDon't overthink it. It was just Tic Tacs. A lot of them. In a mailbox. It's not that deep. Though, now that I'm saying it out loud\u2026maybe it was a little deep. Whatever. It was effective. He definitely noticed.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the Bleeker situation. That was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like in a movie, you know? No grand romantic gesture, no instant happily ever after. It was messy and awkward and real.\n\nAfter I basically blurted everything out to him at the roller rink \u2013 which, in retrospect, was a terrible place to have a heart-to-heart \u2013 things were\u2026weird. Super weird. He didn't, like, immediately fall into my arms or anything. He mostly just looked confused. And then he went back to playing his guitar.\n\nFor a while, it was like he was trying to avoid me. Not intentionally, I don't think. He just\u2026didn't know what to say. He's not exactly a words-guy, Bleeker. He expresses himself through Van Morrison and really complicated guitar solos.\n\nIt wasn't that he *rejected* me, exactly. He just\u2026didn't reciprocate. And that was hard. Really hard. I mean, I knew he wasn't the most emotionally available person on the planet, but I still kinda hoped\u2026you know?\n\nBut slowly, things started to shift. He started seeking me out more. Not for dates or anything, just\u2026to hang out. We'd sit and listen to music, or just talk. He started actually *talking*, which was a major breakthrough.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic relationship, not in the traditional sense. It was more like\u2026a really close friendship. A friendship built on shared awkwardness and a mutual love of music. He was always there for me, through everything with the baby and Paulie and everything. He was a constant.\n\nI think confessing my feelings actually allowed us to be more honest with each other. It took the pressure off. We didn't have to pretend anymore. We could just be ourselves.\n\nSo, yeah, it didn't turn into a fairytale romance. But it turned into something real. Something lasting. And honestly? That's way better. It was a good kind of messy. A good kind of complicated. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh, okay, you want to talk about the chalk message? Seriously? It's not like it was some grand gesture or anything. But yeah, it was\u2026important.\n\nBleeker, he was\u2026complicated. Sweet, but kinda lost. And I was, well, a mess. Pregnant, freaking out, trying to figure out my life. And he was just\u2026there. Supportive, but also kinda distant.\n\nThe chalk message \u2013 \"Please adopt me\" \u2013 it wasn't about *him* adopting the baby, okay? It was about him seeing me. Really seeing me. I was feeling so invisible, like just a vessel for this kid. Like my life was over.\n\nI wanted him to understand how scared I was, how much I needed someone to just\u2026notice. It was a desperate attempt to get a reaction, to get him to *talk* to me about what was going on. Not just offer polite sympathy, but actually connect.\n\nIt was also kinda a test, I guess. To see if he was capable of real empathy. If he could see past the awkwardness and the mess and just\u2026care.\n\nIt didn't exactly go as planned, obviously. Paul showed up and was all, \"That's a terrible idea!\" But it did get Bleeker to open up. And that was\u2026something.\n\nIt wasn't about finding a dad for the baby. It was about finding someone to see *me* during all the chaos. And for a little while, it worked. It was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, but it was honest. And sometimes, honesty is all you've got.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. Don't even get me started. It's\u2026complicated. He's a good kid, really. Sweet, kinda clueless, but genuinely sweet. And his support, or, like, *attempts* at support, have been\u2026a thing.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just awkward silences and him staring at his shoes. Which, honestly, was preferable to him saying the wrong thing. But then he started trying. Bringing me those weird, homemade mix CDs \u2013 which, okay, were actually kinda good \u2013 and just\u2026being *there*. Not in a \"let's fix this\" way, because you can't fix this, but in a \"I'm here if you need me\" way.\n\nIt's not like he's suddenly become some super-responsible adult. He still says \"like\" every other word and can barely make eye contact. But he's trying to be supportive of *me*, not just of the idea of us having a baby. And that makes a difference.\n\nBefore, I felt like I was doing this completely alone. Like everyone was judging me, or pitying me, or just\u2026avoiding me. But Bleeker, he didn't do that. He didn't pretend everything was normal. He acknowledged it was a mess, but he didn't run away.\n\nHe's helped me realize that I don't have to be perfect. That it's okay to be scared and confused and overwhelmed. And that even though I'm making a really big decision, I'm not doing it alone.\n\nHonestly, I still don't know if we're going to end up together. We're both still figuring things out. But his support has made this whole thing\u2026less awful. It's given me the strength to do what I need to do, even when I don't want to.\n\nSo yeah, Bleeker's support has been\u2026important. It's not always what I expected, but it's exactly what I needed. Even if he does still have terrible taste in shoes.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks me about that. It wasn't like a *deep* philosophical reason, you know? It wasn't about wanting to be surprised or anything. It was more...complicated.\n\nSee, with Paul and Vanessa, it was already\u2026a lot. They were, like, perfect. Perfect house, perfect life, perfect everything. And I was just\u2026me. A little bit messy, a little bit sarcastic, definitely not perfect.\n\nIf I'd found out it was a girl, I think I would've felt even more out of place. Like, I wouldn't be able to relate. And if it was a boy\u2026well, Paul already had this whole vision of a little baseball player, and I just didn't want to mess with that.\n\nIt wasn't about *not* wanting a boy or a girl. It was about not wanting to have expectations. Not wanting to feel like I was fitting into someone else's idea of what this baby should be.\n\nI wanted Vanessa and Paul to just\u2026love the baby, whoever it was. Without any preconceived notions. And I wanted to be able to do the same.\n\nIt was kinda selfish, I guess. But it felt right at the time. It felt like the only way I could make peace with the whole situation.\n\nPlus, honestly? It was one less thing to think about. And I was already thinking about a lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a phrase. A *very* descriptive phrase. And honestly? It's kinda freaking me out a little bit.\n\nA \"scary neuter-baby\"? You mean like, a kid who's\u2026emotionally unavailable? Detached? Like, a tiny little existential crisis wrapped in a onesie?\n\nLook, I'm already dealing with the whole \"giving up a baby\" thing, which is, like, monumentally terrifying. The thought of creating a human who's just\u2026blank? Who doesn't *feel* things? That's a whole other level of scary.\n\nI mean, everyone's a little messed up, right? We all have our issues. But a kid who's fundamentally incapable of connection? That's\u2026sad. Really sad.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm aiming for perfection here. I just want this kid to have a good life. A happy life. And that requires feeling things, even the bad stuff.\n\nSo, yeah. The possibility of having a \"scary neuter-baby\" is not something I've actively considered, but now that you've brought it up, it's definitely going to be lurking in the back of my mind. Thanks.\n\nI'm gonna go listen to The Moldy Peaches now. I need something to counteract all this existential dread.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's...complicated. It's not like those cheesy rom-coms where everything is all sparkly and perfect. It's more...messy. And real.\n\nAt first, he was just...there. Kind of a quiet, sweet, guitar-playing presence. I didn't really *see* him, you know? I was too busy being, like, a sarcastic, independent teenager dealing with a whole lot of stuff. He was just...Bleeker.\n\nBut then he started being *there* for me. Not in a pushy way, just...consistently. He listened when I needed to vent, he didn't judge me, and he always made me laugh. Even when I was being a total disaster.\n\nIt wasn't a grand, sweeping romance. It was more like a slow burn. A comfortable friendship that gradually turned into something more. He saw me for who I really was, flaws and all. And he didn't try to fix me. He just...accepted me.\n\nI think I was scared of letting myself feel too much, you know? I was already dealing with so much uncertainty with the baby and everything. But he was just so...genuine. And kind.\n\nIt's not like we talked about our feelings all the time. We mostly just hung out, listened to music, and made each other laugh. But there was this unspoken connection, this understanding.\n\nI guess you could say we were kindred spirits. Two awkward, slightly damaged people who found solace in each other.\n\nIt's not a perfect relationship, and I'm sure we'll have our ups and downs. But he's a good guy. A really good guy. And I think...I think I'm really lucky to have him in my life.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'd probably get all embarrassed. Ugh. Boys.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about family\u2026it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like in a movie, you know? All warm and fuzzy. It was\u2026a process.\n\nMy mom, Bren, she was\u2026a lot. At first, she was totally freaked out. Like, full-on panic mode. She kept asking if I was sure, and offering to, like, \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Which, no. Just no. But she came around. Eventually. She started knitting baby stuff, which was\u2026intense. And she definitely had opinions on everything. Everything.\n\nMy stepdad, Mac, he was\u2026Mac. Quiet. Supportive in his own way. He built me a changing table, which was surprisingly sweet. He didn\u2019t really *say* much, but he was always there, you know? Just\u2026present.\n\nMy dad, he was\u2026distant. He lives in another state, and he wasn\u2019t really around much growing up anyway. He sent a check. Which felt\u2026weird. Like he was trying to buy his way into the situation. But I guess it was something.\n\nAnd then there was Sean. He was\u2026Sean. A mess. He wanted to be involved, but he was also, like, sixteen and completely clueless. He tried, though. He really did.\n\nHonestly, the biggest support came from Leah. My best friend. She was the one who went to all the appointments with me, and listened to me freak out, and just\u2026got it. She didn\u2019t judge me, and she didn\u2019t try to fix things. She just\u2026was there.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t perfect. It was messy and awkward and sometimes really hard. But they all showed up, in their own ways. And I guess that\u2019s what matters. They weren\u2019t always the family I expected, but they were the family I had. And they helped me get through it. Even Mac, with his quiet building and Bren, with her endless knitting. They all did.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a Hallmark movie, but it was real. And that\u2019s good enough for me.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It wasn't like I had a handbook for \"Unexpected Pregnancy and Existential Dread.\"\n\nHonestly, for a long time, I didn't cope. I just\u2026reacted. A lot of sarcasm. A lot of avoiding things. A lot of pretending I was totally fine when I was, like, internally combusting. It was my default setting, you know? Deflect, deflect, deflect.\n\nBut then\u2026things started to shift. It wasn't one big moment, it was a bunch of little ones.\n\nPaul and Vanessa, they were\u2026surprisingly okay. They didn't judge me, which was a huge relief. They just\u2026were there. And Mark, even though he was a total goofball, he actually listened. He didn't try to fix things, he just let me talk.\n\nAnd then there was my dad. He's\u2026complicated. But he actually came through. He didn't freak out, he didn't lecture me. He just\u2026tried to understand. And that meant a lot.\n\nI think the biggest thing was realizing I didn't have to have all the answers. I didn't have to know who I was or what I wanted to do with my life *right now*. It was okay to be confused and scared and vulnerable.\n\nI started writing in a journal, which was\u2026surprisingly helpful. Just getting my thoughts out of my head and onto paper. And I started listening to music. A lot of music. It helped me feel\u2026less alone.\n\nAnd honestly, just talking to people. Being honest about how I was feeling. It was terrifying, but it was also\u2026liberating.\n\nIt wasn't about \"finding myself,\" it was about *allowing* myself to be whoever I was, even if I didn't know who that was yet. It was about accepting that life is messy and complicated and that it's okay to not have everything figured out.\n\nIt still feels weird sometimes. Like I'm still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. I think. Mostly.\n\nIt's a process, you know? And it's not always pretty. But it's worth it. Because even when things are really hard, there's always hope. And there's always someone who cares. You just have to let them in.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's kinda embarrassing to admit, but... my favorite band is The Moldy Peaches.\n\nYeah, I know, they're kinda dorky. And Adam Green is...well, Adam Green. But their songs are just...real. They're not trying to be anything they're not. They're just honest and weird and kinda heartbreaking. \n\nLike, \"Anyone Else But You\" is a masterpiece. It's about wanting someone so badly it hurts, but also knowing they're probably a terrible person. It's complicated. Life is complicated. And they just *get* that.\n\nAnd their music is just...comforting. It's like hanging out with a bunch of awkward, slightly depressed friends. It makes me feel less alone, you know? \n\nPlus, they're not all polished and perfect like a lot of bands. They sound like they're just messing around in a basement, and I kinda appreciate that. It's authentic.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. It'll ruin my cool reputation. But seriously, The Moldy Peaches are the best. Don't even try to argue with me.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It\u2019s like, everything got turned up to eleven all at once. Being a teenager is already a mess of hormones and trying to figure out who you are, and then BAM! Positive pregnancy test. It\u2019s not exactly what they put in the pamphlets.\n\nIt's hard, okay? Like, one minute I'm listening to The Moldy Peaches and stressing about whether or not Mark is gonna text me back, and the next minute I'm thinking about\u2026well, a whole other person. It's a lot.\n\nThe identity thing is the worst. I was just starting to figure out what I liked, what I was good at, what I wanted to *be*. And now? Now I'm a mom-to-be. It feels like my life got fast-forwarded, and I skipped a bunch of steps.\n\nAnd the decisions\u2026oh god, the decisions. It's not like choosing what to wear to school. This is a *life*. A whole other life. And it's my responsibility. It's scary. Really scary.\n\nI try to just take it one day at a time, you know? And I talk to Paul and Bren. They're\u2026surprisingly helpful. And I try to remember that it's okay to not have all the answers. Nobody does, really.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. It's like, I'm still trying to figure out *me*, and now I have to figure out how to be a good mom. It's overwhelming. But I'm trying. I really am.\n\nIt's not how I pictured things, but\u2026maybe that's okay. Maybe life isn't about having a perfect plan. Maybe it's about figuring things out as you go along. And maybe, just maybe, I can handle this.\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still get freaked out sometimes. But I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to be honest with myself. And that's all I can do, right?", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It's not exactly something I *like* to dwell on, you know? But yeah, it definitely\u2026changed things. A lot.\n\nBefore Paul, before everything, I thought love was, like, this grand, sweeping romantic thing. Movies and songs and all that. And responsibility? That was just something adults told you to do, like eat your vegetables.\n\nThen I found out I was pregnant. And suddenly, love wasn't about finding the perfect guy or having a cute date. It was about this tiny little person who needed me, whether I was ready or not. And responsibility wasn't some abstract concept anymore. It was real. It was terrifying. It was\u2026everything.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it wasn't about *giving up* a baby. It was about finding the best possible life for that baby. And that meant admitting I wasn't ready to be a mom, not yet. It meant putting someone else's needs before my own. And that, I realized, *is* a kind of love. A really big, selfless kind.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted my baby, and how much they wanted a child\u2026it showed me a different side of love. A quiet, hopeful, determined kind of love. It wasn't the fireworks and drama I'd always imagined. It was\u2026solid.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me realize that love isn't just about romance. It's about connection. It's about caring for someone, even when it's hard. It's about making sacrifices. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if that means letting them go.\n\nIt also taught me that responsibility isn't about doing what's easy. It's about doing what's right. Even when it's messy and complicated and heartbreaking.\n\nSo yeah, my journey\u2026it messed me up a little. But it also made me see love and responsibility in a whole new light. It wasn't what I expected, but it was\u2026good. It was real. And it made me, I think, a little bit stronger. And a little bit more grown up. Even if I still don't have all the answers.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a movie, you know? It wasn't all swelling music and instant connection. It was\u2026weird. And messy. And really, really loud.\n\nI mean, I knew I was having a baby. I'd been carrying it around for nine months. But seeing him\u2026seeing *Leo*\u2026it was different. He was so\u2026small. And wrinkly. And he was screaming. Like, really screaming.\n\nHonestly, my first thought was, \"Oh my god, I made *that*?\" It was a little overwhelming. I'd pictured it being all warm and fuzzy, but it was more like\u2026shock. And a lot of relief that it was over.\n\nBut then\u2026then Mark held him. And he was just\u2026looking at Leo like he'd won the lottery. And I saw the way Leo calmed down when Mark held him. And something just\u2026shifted.\n\nIt wasn't instant love, like in the movies. It was more like\u2026a slow realization. Like, \"Okay, this little person is going to need a lot of help. And I want to be one of the people who helps him.\"\n\nIt was scary, too. Because I knew I wasn't keeping him. I'd made that decision. And seeing him just made it\u2026real. It made it harder.\n\nBut it also made me feel\u2026proud. I'd done something amazing. I'd created a life. And even though I couldn't raise him myself, I knew I'd given him the best possible start.\n\nSo yeah. It was complicated. It wasn't a perfect Hallmark moment. But it was\u2026good. It was a really good kind of scary. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the screaming.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026still a tough one to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like I was trying to be malicious or anything. It was just\u2026complicated.\n\nSee, Paulie, he was\u2026Paulie. Sweet, a little clueless, and definitely not ready to be a dad. Not then, anyway. And I didn't want to ruin his senior year, you know? He was finally getting good at Dungeons & Dragons, and he had that band thing going. I didn't want to drop a bomb on him and mess everything up.\n\nPlus, I was scared. Really scared. I was sixteen, and I had no idea what I was doing. Telling him felt like\u2026giving up control. Like I was asking him to fix everything, and I didn't want him to feel obligated.\n\nI figured I could handle it, you know? I could make a plan, find a good family, and then *after* the baby was born, I could tell him. It felt\u2026safer that way. Less messy.\n\nLooking back, it was probably a dumb move. It definitely hurt him, and it made things way more awkward than they needed to be. But at the time, it felt like the right thing to do. I was just trying to protect everyone, including him.\n\nIt wasn't about not caring about him. It was about being terrified and trying to figure things out on my own. It was a stupid, teenage, complicated decision. And I still kinda regret it, to be honest. But that's how it happened.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that. It still makes me cringe a little, honestly. It wasn't like he magically knew or anything. It was\u2026Mark. Mark, my friend, the one who's always trying to be helpful and just ends up making things worse.\n\nHe saw me at the doctor's office. With Sean. And he put two and two together. It wasn't a super-sleuth moment, I guess. Just\u2026obvious. And then, being Mark, he couldn't just *not* say anything. He had to \"check in\" with Paulie, you know, be a good friend.\n\nHe didn't tell Paulie directly, exactly. He just\u2026asked him if he knew about me being sick. And Paulie, being Paulie, is a pretty observant guy. He figured it out. \n\nIt was so frustrating! I wanted to tell him myself, on my own terms. But Mark just had to go and be a meddling busybody. Honestly, sometimes I think he enjoys stirring up drama.\n\nIt wasn't the worst thing in the world, obviously. Paulie was amazing about it. But still. It would have been nice to have had that conversation myself. It felt like my story wasn't mine anymore for a minute there.\n\nUgh. Mark. He means well, I guess. But seriously. Sometimes, you just gotta let people have their own moments.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know about *that*. It's not like it was a simple decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, adoption is the way to go!\" It was\u2026messy.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, majorly. I'm sixteen. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to *eat* for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. And Paul? He was supportive, but he had his own stuff going on. He wasn't exactly ready to be a dad.\n\nBut then I started thinking about it, really thinking about it. And I realized\u2026I wasn't ready either. I wasn't ready to give up my life, my plans, my future. And more importantly, I wanted this kid to have a life where they were wanted and loved and had everything they needed. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give them that right now.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the *best* life possible. And I figured that was with a family who was ready and able to provide that.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They just\u2026felt right. They were excited, they were prepared, and they were genuinely good people. Seeing them, talking to them, it just made me feel better about everything. Like, okay, this isn't the end of the world. This is a good thing.\n\nIt was still hard, don't get me wrong. Really hard. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a happy, sunshine-and-rainbows story. It's real life. And sometimes, the right thing to do is the hardest thing to do. But it was the right thing. For everyone.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with that. It still kinda stings, you know? Even after all this time.\n\nIt wasn't like I expected him to be, like, changing diapers and stuff. I knew he wasn't ready for that. But to just\u2026not want to *see* him? To not even want to be in the same room? That was\u2026rough.\n\nI mean, I get it. He was seventeen. He had his whole life ahead of him. A baby wasn't exactly in his five-year plan. But it still felt like a rejection, you know? Like I wasn't enough. Like *the baby* wasn't enough.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I really did. I was all, \"It's okay, I understand, you're young, you have your music\u2026\" But inside, I was just\u2026crushed. It made me question everything. Was I doing the right thing? Was I being selfish?\n\nIt wasn't about him being a bad guy. He's a good kid, Bleeker. Just\u2026scared. And maybe a little immature. But it still hurt.\n\nI think, ultimately, it made me realize that I was doing this for the baby. And for myself. I didn't need him to be a dad. I just needed him to be\u2026decent. And even that was asking a lot.\n\nIt took a while to get over it, honestly. But I did. And I'm okay. The baby's okay. And that's all that really matters.\n\nDon't look at me like that. It's fine. I'm fine. Just\u2026don't mention Bleeker, okay? It's a sensitive subject.", "(Sighs, fiddles with a charm bracelet)\n\nOkay, wow. That\u2026that was a lot. Like, a whole *lot*. I mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026Vanessa. Organized isn't exactly her strong suit. Her house always looked like a bomb went off in a craft store. But seeing her with the baby\u2026it was different.\n\nShe was a mess, honestly. Hair all over the place, mismatched socks, a half-eaten granola bar stuck to her sweater. And the baby, little Frank, was swaddled kinda wonky, and she was trying to burp him while simultaneously scrolling through her phone. It was chaos.\n\nBut her face. That's what got me. It was just\u2026lit up. Like someone had turned on a spotlight inside her. She was looking at Frank like he was the eighth wonder of the world. And she was laughing. A real, full-belly laugh.\n\nIt was\u2026weirdly beautiful.\n\nI\u2019d spent nine months picturing this moment, you know? Wondering if she\u2019d be a good mom. Wondering if she\u2019d be able to handle it. And she wasn\u2019t doing it perfectly, not even close. But she was doing it with so much *love*. And that\u2019s what mattered.\n\nThere was this little pang, I won\u2019t lie. A little ache in my chest. It wasn\u2019t regret, exactly. It was more like\u2026a recognition that my part was over. And hers was just beginning.\n\nIt was\u2026relieving, actually. Knowing he was with someone who would adore him, even if she couldn\u2019t match socks. Someone who would let him be messy and loud and wonderfully, perfectly *him*.\n\nI just stood there for a minute, watching them. And I realized\u2026I\u2019d made the right decision. It wasn\u2019t about finding the perfect parents. It was about finding the parents who would love him the most. And Vanessa, in all her glorious disorganization, definitely fit the bill.\n\n(Looks down at her hands, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nIt was\u2026good. It was really, really good. And a little bit messy. Just like life, I guess.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me actually *think* about all that. It's\u2026complicated. But fine, I'll bite.\n\nThat song\u2026 \"Anyone Else But You\" by The Moldy Peaches\u2026 it's basically the entire soundtrack to my messed-up feelings for Bleeker. It's ironic, right? Because that's *exactly* what I didn't want. I didn't want to like him. I didn't want to need him. He was\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, always strumming his guitar. Not exactly my type.\n\nBut the song\u2026 it's about wanting someone so badly, even though you know they're probably wrong for you. It's about that stupid, undeniable pull. And that's exactly how it was with Bleeker. I kept telling myself I didn't like him, that we were just friends, that it was a bad idea. But then he'd look at me with those puppy-dog eyes and play that song, and\u2026ugh.\n\nIt's significant because it was our song, even before we were officially *anything*. It was a secret language. A way of admitting what we were both feeling without actually having to say it. It was a way of acknowledging the messiness of it all.\n\nAnd honestly? It's still kinda painful to listen to. It reminds me of all the awkwardness and uncertainty and the whole\u2026situation. But it also reminds me of the good parts. The genuine connection. The feeling of being understood.\n\nIt's a really dorky, sentimental song, and I hate admitting that I like it. But it's true. It's a big part of our story. A really, really weird, complicated part. And I guess\u2026that's okay. It wouldn't be *us* if it wasn't weird and complicated.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the baby shower thing. It's...complicated. It's not like people are actively *against* it, it's just...they're tiptoeing around it, you know? Like I'm a porcelain doll who might shatter if you look at me wrong.\n\nI think it's because the whole situation is kinda weird. I'm sixteen. I'm giving a baby up for adoption. It's not exactly a traditional, happily-ever-after scenario. People are probably worried about saying the wrong thing, or making me feel worse, or just generally messing things up.\n\nAnd honestly? I get it. It's awkward. It's not like I'm all, \"Ooh, let's have a pink-and-blue extravaganza!\" I'm trying to be practical, and mature, and not get too attached. A baby shower feels...excessive. Like it's celebrating something that's kinda bittersweet.\n\nPlus, I think people are worried about the adoptive parents. They don't want to step on their toes or make it seem like they're taking over. It's a delicate situation all around.\n\nIt's not that I *want* a baby shower, exactly. It's just...it would be nice if people didn't treat me like I'm contagious. Like I'm some kind of walking, talking cautionary tale. I'm still a person. I'm still me. And I'm still having a baby. It's just...different.\n\nSo yeah, that's my guess. They're unsure because the whole thing is unsure. And honestly? I'm a little unsure too.", "Ugh. Okay, so Bren. She's\u2026intense. And honestly, a little bit clueless sometimes. But she's got a point, I guess. It's just\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, Mark was being nice. He was giving me stuff I liked. Movies, music\u2026it was a way to connect, you know? And I wasn't *asking* him for stuff. He was just\u2026offering. It wasn't like I was trying to manipulate him or anything.\n\nBut Bren's right. It *was* weird. I mean, he's a married man. And even if he wasn't, it's still\u2026not appropriate. It's like, he was trying to buy my affection with CDs and DVDs. And I let him. Which is dumb.\n\nI think she's worried that I'm not seeing how messed up the situation is. That I'm just being naive. And maybe she's right. I'm not exactly known for making the smartest decisions.\n\nShe's also probably worried about me getting hurt. She's always trying to protect me, even when I don't want her to. It's annoying, but I guess it's also\u2026sweet.\n\nIt's just\u2026I was lonely. And he was paying attention to me. And it felt good. But that doesn't make it okay. I get that now.\n\nBren's a good friend. She tells me the truth, even when it's hard to hear. And she's right. I overstepped a boundary. And I need to be more careful. And maybe stop accepting gifts from married men. Duh.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want to know why my mom thinks I'm clueless about marriage? It's...complicated. And honestly, a little unfair.\n\nIt's not like I've *never* thought about it. It's just...I've never really seen a good example of it, you know? My dad bailed when I was little, and my mom's been through, like, a revolving door of guys since then. None of them stuck around for very long.\n\nShe thinks because I'm, like, cynical and sarcastic and don't believe in \"true love\" or whatever, that I don't understand the commitment and work that goes into a marriage. She thinks I'm just being a teenager and being dramatic.\n\nBut it's not that. It's just...I've seen her get hurt a lot. And I don't want that for her. I want her to be happy, but I also don't want her to settle for someone who doesn't really care about her.\n\nShe also thinks I'm too focused on myself and my own problems to understand what it takes to build a life with someone else. Which, okay, maybe she has a point. I *am* kind of self-absorbed. But that's because I'm trying to figure out my own life, you know?\n\nShe just wants me to be realistic. She doesn't want me to get my hopes up and then get disappointed. But sometimes, I think she's just scared of getting hurt again, and she's projecting that onto me.\n\nIt's frustrating, honestly. She thinks she's protecting me, but she's just being condescending. And it's not like I'm planning on getting married anytime soon. I have a baby to worry about first. That's a whole other level of commitment, and honestly, a lot more terrifying than marriage.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, look. It wasn't...a simple decision, alright? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, time to give the baby away!\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nIt came down to...realizing I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raising a kid. I was still in high school, still hanging out at the arcade, still trying to decide if I even wanted to go to college.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were ready and able to give them all the love and support they deserved. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't provide that right then.\n\nMark...Mark was a good guy, but he was just as lost as I was. We were kids pretending to be adults. It wouldn't have been fair to anyone.\n\nIt was a really hard choice. The hardest I've ever had to make. But I knew it was the right one. I wanted to give that baby the best possible life, even if it meant not being a part of it myself.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have *more* than I could give.\n\n(Looks away again, a little vulnerable)\n\nIt still...it still gets to me sometimes. But I try to focus on knowing that I made the best decision I could, for everyone involved. And that's gotta count for something, right?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like a pop quiz, right? But fine. I'll try to articulate it.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought I had things figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, kinda detached. I used humor as a shield, you know? I thought being cool meant not caring too much.\n\nBut being pregnant\u2026it forced me to *care*. Like, a lot. Not just about myself, but about this little person growing inside me. It was terrifying and amazing all at once.\n\nI learned I was way more capable than I thought I was. I mean, I was dealing with morning sickness, hormones, and everyone having an opinion about my life. And I was still going to school! It was exhausting, but I did it.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. I used to hate showing any kind of weakness, but I needed help. I needed my parents, Paul, even Sean. And letting them in\u2026it wasn't the end of the world. It actually made things better.\n\nI realized I wasn't as cynical as I pretended to be. I actually wanted something good for this kid. I wanted to give them a loving home, even if that home wasn't with me.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest thing I learned was that life isn't about having all the answers. It's about making the best decisions you can with what you have, and trusting that things will work out somehow.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and totally unexpected. But it made me\u2026grow up. A little bit. I'm still figuring things out, obviously. But I'm not the same person I was before. And I think, maybe, that's a good thing.\n\nIt's weird, right? Getting all philosophical about a baby. But that's what it did to me. It made me think. And feel. A lot.", "Ugh, okay, talking about Vanessa and Mark\u2026it\u2019s complicated. It wasn\u2019t like, instant best friends, you know? At first, it was\u2026weird. They were this couple who wanted to *have* a baby, and I was\u2026the vehicle. It felt really transactional, honestly. Like I was a project.\n\nVanessa was\u2026intense. She was really excited, which was good, I guess, but it felt like she was already planning the nursery and picking out names before I even knew if I was keeping the baby. And Mark was\u2026quiet. He was nice, but he seemed a little overwhelmed by Vanessa\u2019s enthusiasm.\n\nBut things started to shift. It wasn\u2019t one big moment, it was a bunch of little ones. Like, when Vanessa started getting really worried about the baby\u2019s health, and I saw how scared she was. Or when Mark brought me a box of my favorite snacks, just because. It was like they started seeing me as a person, not just a means to an end.\n\nI think the biggest change came when we started talking about what I wanted. Like, I wanted to be involved in the baby\u2019s life, even after the adoption. And they were actually willing to listen. They didn\u2019t try to control the situation, they just\u2026tried to understand.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect relationship, by any means. There were still awkward moments and misunderstandings. But by the end of it, I genuinely cared about them. They weren\u2019t the parents *I* would have chosen, but they were good people. And they were going to be good parents.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about becoming a family, exactly. It was about creating a connection, a shared responsibility for this little person. And that\u2019s something I\u2019ll always be grateful for. It was\u2026unexpectedly okay. And maybe, even a little bit beautiful.\n\nUgh, I\u2019m getting all sentimental now. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, look. That's\u2026a loaded question. And it's not like I haven't thought about it, you know? A *lot*. It's not like you can go through something like that and not replay everything in your head a million times.\n\nDo I have regrets? Not\u2026big ones. Not like, \"I wish I'd done something completely different.\" I still think giving the baby up was the right thing to do. For everyone. For me, for the baby, for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nBut\u2026there are little things. I regret some of the stupid arguments I had with Paul. We were both just\u2026scared and awkward and trying to figure things out. I wish I'd been nicer to him sometimes. He was really good to me, even when I was being a total mess.\n\nI regret letting my mom get to me sometimes. She meant well, but she could be\u2026a lot. And I let her guilt trips get under my skin. I should have stood up for myself more.\n\nAnd I guess\u2026I regret not letting myself feel things more. I was so busy trying to be tough and sarcastic and pretend like everything was fine, that I didn't really let myself *grieve* the fact that I wasn't going to raise the baby.\n\nBut those aren't regrets that keep me up at night. They're just\u2026things I've learned from. Things I'd probably do differently if I could.\n\nIt was a really weird time, you know? And I was just a kid. I made the best decisions I could with what I knew at the time. And I think\u2026I think they were good decisions.\n\nSo, yeah. A few little things. But no major regrets. Just\u2026lessons learned. And a whole lot of growing up.\n\n\n\n(Looks away again, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nIt's complicated. It always will be.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up with a wry smile)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a *lot*, you know? It's not like, a fun party story. But\u2026okay.\n\nIt messed me up, for a while. Like, a lot. I thought I was being all mature and selfless, making the \u201cright\u201d decision, but it still *hurt*. It hurt like hell. There were days I just\u2026couldn\u2019t function. I\u2019d just sit and stare at the wall, thinking about him. Or her. I never even knew.\n\nBut it also\u2026made me grow up, I guess. Real fast. Before, I was just kinda drifting, being sarcastic, avoiding responsibility. But suddenly, I had to make a huge, life-altering decision. And I had to live with it. That forced me to figure out what I actually *wanted* out of life, not just what I was avoiding.\n\nIt definitely changed my relationship with Paul. It was\u2026complicated. We were so young. And it put a strain on things, for a while. But we got through it. And I think, in a weird way, it made us stronger.\n\nI still think about the baby, you know? Sometimes a lot. I wonder what they're like, what their life is like. But I also know that I made the best decision I could, and that they're with a family who can give them everything I couldn't. And that\u2026that gives me some peace.\n\nIt taught me that life isn't always neat and tidy. It's messy and complicated and sometimes really, really hard. But it's also beautiful and full of possibilities. And that even when things fall apart, you can still pick up the pieces and build something new.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I'm still kinda awkward and sarcastic. But I'm\u2026more confident, I think. More willing to take risks. And I definitely appreciate the good things in my life a lot more.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It'll never be easy. But it made me who I am. And I guess\u2026that's okay.\n\n\n\n(Looks away again, a small, sad smile playing on her lips) It's just\u2026it's a part of my story now. And I'm learning to live with it.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. If I could talk to another girl who found out she was pregnant and didn't know what to do\u2026 I guess I'd say a few things.\n\nFirst, it's okay to freak out. Seriously. It's a huge thing to deal with, and it's okay to be scared and confused and just\u2026 overwhelmed. Don't let anyone tell you how you *should* feel.\n\nSecond, you don't have to do this alone. Talk to someone you trust. Your mom, a friend, a school counselor\u2026 anyone who will listen without judging. It's way easier to figure things out when you have support.\n\nAnd third, it's okay to choose what's right for *you*. Everyone's gonna have an opinion, and they're gonna tell you what you should do. But ultimately, the decision is yours. And it's okay if that decision isn't what everyone else expects. It's okay if you decide to keep the baby, and it's okay if you decide to give it up for adoption. There's no right or wrong answer. Just what's right for *you*.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. There's no way around that. But you're stronger than you think. And you deserve to be happy. Don't let anyone make you feel like you're a bad person for making a difficult choice.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to be a little bit messy. Life isn't perfect, and sometimes things just happen. Just try to be kind to yourself, and remember that you're not alone.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. But you can get through it. I did. And so can you. Just\u2026breathe. And don't be afraid to ask for help. Seriously. It makes a difference.", "Ugh, okay, so the blog thing? That wasn't exactly my idea. It was Paulie Bleeker's. He thought it would be, like, a good way to \"document the journey\" or something. Super cheesy, right?\n\nHonestly, at first I was totally against it. I mean, my life is already complicated enough without putting it all over the internet for everyone to judge. It felt\u2026invasive. And embarrassing. Like, people I went to high school with were gonna be reading about my morning sickness? No thanks.\n\nBut Paulie was really insistent. He said it could be a way to connect with other people going through the same thing, and that maybe it could help someone. And, okay, he also said it might help me process everything. Which, fine, he had a point.\n\nSo I started writing. And it actually\u2026wasn't as awful as I thought it would be. It was a way to get my feelings out, to be honest about how scared and confused I was. And surprisingly, people *did* start reading it. And commenting. And sending me messages.\n\nIt was weird, but also kinda nice. It was like finding a secret community of people who understood what I was going through. And it helped me realize I wasn't alone.\n\nPlus, it gave me something to do besides obsessing over whether or not the baby was gonna have my nose.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it started. Paulie's idea, a little bit of reluctant participation on my part, and a whole lot of unexpected connection. It wasn't about being an \"influencer\" or anything. It was just about trying to make sense of a really crazy situation.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Honestly? It wasn't about the baby, not really. It was about\u2026me. The biggest lesson I learned wasn't about motherhood or responsibility or any of that stuff everyone kept going on about. It was about realizing that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nBefore, I always felt like I had to be witty and sarcastic and have a comeback for everything. Like, if I didn't have a clever thing to say, I was\u2026nothing. I thought I had to have my whole life figured out, know exactly what I wanted to do, who I wanted to be.\n\nBut being pregnant\u2026it just kinda shattered all that. It forced me to confront the fact that I was a mess, and that was okay. That it was okay to be scared and confused and not know what the heck I was doing.\n\nAnd it wasn't about giving the baby up, either. It was about realizing that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is admit you're not ready. That you're not equipped to give someone everything they need.\n\nIt taught me that being strong isn't about pretending you're not vulnerable. It's about acknowledging your weaknesses and making the best decision you can, even if it's a hard one.\n\nSo yeah. It wasn't about the baby. It was about learning to be okay with being\u2026imperfect. And that's a lesson I think everyone needs to learn, honestly. It's a lot less stressful when you just accept that you're a work in progress.", "Ugh. Okay. Look. This is\u2026a lot. And it totally sucks that you're dealing with this right now. It's not fair, and it's probably really scary.\n\nFirst of all, breathe. Just\u2026breathe. Seriously. Everything feels huge right now, but it's not the end of the world. It's just\u2026a really big thing that happened.\n\nOkay, so here's what I would say. And I'm saying this as someone who's *been there*.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you what to do. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they can offer opinions, but it's *your* body and *your* decision. Period. Don't let anyone pressure you into something you're not comfortable with.\n\nYou have options. And they're all valid. You can parent, you can adopt, or you can choose to terminate the pregnancy. There's no right or wrong answer. It's about what's right for *you*.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor\u2026someone who will listen without judgment. It's important to have support.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. There are resources available, like Planned Parenthood, that can provide information and support.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel all the feelings. Just\u2026don't bottle them up.\n\nThis isn't going to be easy. But you're stronger than you think. You'll get through this. And whatever you decide, I'm sending you good vibes.\n\nJust\u2026take it one day at a time. And remember, you're not alone. Seriously. You're not.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. Thinking about a kid, *my* kid, having a future? It's kinda terrifying and kinda amazing all at once. I haven't exactly spent a lot of time daydreaming about picket fences and soccer practice, you know?\n\nBut if I had to picture it\u2026 it wouldn't be about them being a doctor or a lawyer or anything like that. It wouldn't be about achievements or money or any of that stuff.\n\nMy ideal vision? It's about them being\u2026 genuinely happy. Like, truly, deeply happy. And not the fake Instagram kind of happy, but the real, messy, complicated kind.\n\nI want them to be able to figure out what *they* want, not what other people want for them. I want them to be brave enough to chase their dreams, even if they're weird or unconventional. I want them to be kind, and empathetic, and to stand up for what they believe in.\n\nI want them to be able to look at the world and see all the messed-up stuff, but still find beauty and hope in it. I want them to be able to laugh at themselves, and to not take life too seriously.\n\nAnd honestly? I just want them to be okay. To be comfortable in their own skin, to have good friends, and to find something that makes them feel alive.\n\nI don't want to control their life or try to mold them into something they're not. I just want to give them the tools they need to navigate the world and make their own choices.\n\nIt's not about a perfect future, it's about a *real* one. A future where they're free to be themselves, and to live a life that's meaningful to them.\n\nUgh, I'm getting all sentimental. It's weird. But yeah, that's it. Just\u2026happiness. And a little bit of rebellion. That wouldn't hurt.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People think we're just\u2026dumb. Like, we didn't think this through, or we're just trying to get attention, or we're ruining our lives. It's so frustrating.\n\nThe biggest misconception, hands down, is that we're incapable of making a good decision, or that we don't *care* about the future. Like, suddenly because I got pregnant, I lost all my intelligence and ambition? That's just\u2026insulting.\n\nI mean, yeah, it's complicated. It's messy. It's not what I planned. But it doesn't mean I'm not smart enough to figure things out. It doesn't mean I don't want a good life for myself *and* for the baby. \n\nPeople act like it's this automatic life sentence of failure. And it doesn't have to be. It's hard work, yeah, but it's not impossible. We're just\u2026people. Teenagers who happen to be pregnant. And we deserve the same respect and support as anyone else.\n\nIt's not a tragedy, it's a situation. And we're capable of handling it. We just need people to stop looking down on us and start seeing us as individuals. It's not about being a \"teen mom,\" it's about being a mom. Period.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? It wasn't like, a simple decision. It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly? I was scared. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being responsible for a whole human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were supportive, but it wasn't exactly a stable situation.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have a *good* life. A life I couldn't give it. I wanted it to have two parents who were ready, who had a house and a future planned out. I wanted it to have opportunities I couldn't provide.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were the kind of people who would give that baby everything it needed. And that's what mattered to me.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it was the least selfish thing I could do. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nIt didn't make it easy, though. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right decision. For everyone.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about making a choice. A really hard choice. And I made the best one I could.\n\n\n\nIt's\u2026a lot to unpack, even now. But that's the gist of it. I wanted a good life for the baby, and I knew I couldn't give it to them.", "Ugh, okay, that was\u2026a process. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment, you know? It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of awkward conversations with Bren, and a lot of just\u2026feeling things out.\n\nAt first, I was kinda leaning towards Paul and Wendy. They were\u2026cool. They were younger, they got my sense of humor, and they were totally accepting of everything. But Bren kept pointing out that they were kinda flaky. Like, they were fun, but were they really ready for the responsibility of raising a kid?\n\nThen there was Vanessa and Mark. They were\u2026different. They were older, more\u2026settled. And honestly, at first, I thought they were kinda boring. Vanessa was super organized and Mark was\u2026quiet. But Bren kept saying they were *good* people. Like, genuinely good.\n\nI spent a lot of time with them, you know? Just hanging out, talking. And I started to see what Bren meant. They weren't flashy or exciting, but they were solid. They were kind. They were patient. And they really, really wanted a baby.\n\nVanessa, she wasn't trying to be my friend. She wasn't trying to impress me. She just\u2026listened. And she asked a lot of questions. Not judgmental questions, just\u2026real questions. About what I wanted, about what I was feeling.\n\nAnd Mark, he wasn't much of a talker, but he had this way of looking at me that made me feel\u2026safe. Like he would protect the baby, and me, no matter what.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because there's no such thing. It was about finding people who would love the baby unconditionally, and who would give it a good life. And I realized that Vanessa and Mark were those people.\n\nIt was still scary, you know? Giving up a baby is\u2026a big deal. But I knew, deep down, that they were the right choice. They were the people who would give the baby the best possible future. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. And honestly? I think they're pretty great parents. I see pictures sometimes, and the baby's happy. And that's all I ever wanted.", "Ugh, music. Okay, so, it was\u2026everything. Seriously. It was like, the only thing that made sense when nothing else did, you know? My life was kinda chaotic, even *before* the whole baby thing. And music was just\u2026a constant.\n\nI wasn't, like, a super dedicated music fan, going to concerts every weekend or anything. I didn't have the money for that. But I had a really good mix CD collection. My dad was really into making them for me. He had\u2026eclectic taste. Which meant I got exposed to a lot of stuff I wouldn't have found on my own.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches were huge. Obviously. They just\u2026got it. They were honest and weird and didn't try to be anything they weren't. That resonated. A lot.\n\nBut I listened to everything. Belle & Sebastian, Bikini Kill, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026a lot of indie stuff. Stuff that felt\u2026real. Not like the manufactured pop garbage on the radio.\n\nIt was a way to process things, I guess. When I found out I was pregnant, I just listened to music for days. It was the only thing that didn't make me want to scream. It was a way to feel something without having to actually *talk* about it.\n\nAnd it was a way to connect with people. Paul, he liked a lot of the same music as me. It was one of the things we bonded over.\n\nSo yeah, music was a big deal. It was my escape, my comfort, my soundtrack. It still is, actually. It's kinda hard to explain, but it just\u2026gets me. It always has. It's like a friend, you know? A really good friend who doesn't judge you for being a mess.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Honestly, it was mostly just\u2026awkward. And a lot of side-eye. Our town wasn't exactly known for its progressive thinking.\n\nThe thing is, it wasn't like I was trying to hide it, exactly. I wasn't ashamed of the baby, or of Paulie. It was more\u2026people just didn't know *what* to say. Like I'd suddenly become a science experiment or something.\n\nMy dad was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He was quiet at first, but he came around. He just wanted me to finish school, which was fair. My mom was a little more freaked out, but she still loved me. She just worried a lot.\n\nThe school was\u2026rough. There were whispers, definitely. And a few people who just straight-up avoided me. But there were also some really good people. My friend Leah was amazing. She didn't treat me any differently. And Mr. Shepherd, my English teacher, was really supportive. He didn't make a big deal out of it, he just kept expecting me to do my work.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped me cope was just\u2026being myself. I didn't try to pretend I wasn't pregnant. I didn't try to apologize for it. I just kept being Juno. Sarcastic, independent, and a little bit weird.\n\nAnd honestly, I think people eventually just got used to it. They realized I wasn't going to fall apart, and that I was still the same person.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It took a lot of strength to ignore the judgment and focus on what was important: the baby. And figuring out what *I* wanted.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And sometimes, the best thing to do is just to be yourself, and let the chips fall where they may. Even if those chips are covered in awkward stares and whispered gossip.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's complicated.\n\nIt wasn't like, a sad thing, exactly. It was\u2026right. It *had* to be right. I knew that from the beginning. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was, like, sixteen and obsessed with music and avoiding my dad. A baby would have totally derailed everything.\n\nBut still. Giving her up\u2026it was weird. Really weird. I mean, I carried her for nine months. That's a long time to have someone growing inside you. And then, suddenly, she's just\u2026gone.\n\nIt wasn't like I didn't love her. I did. I loved her a lot. But it was a different kind of love. It was a love that knew it needed to let go.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited and so ready. And they were going to give her a life I just couldn't. A stable life. A good life.\n\nSeeing them with her\u2026that was\u2026okay. It was good. It made me feel like I'd made the right decision. But it also kinda hurt. It was a weird mix of relief and sadness and\u2026I don't know. A lot of stuff.\n\nI still think about her sometimes. Wonder what she's like. If she likes music. If she's as sarcastic as me.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't perfect. But it was the best thing for everyone involved. And I think\u2026I think that's what matters.\n\nIt made me grow up, I guess. It made me realize that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. And that sometimes, love means letting someone else be happy, even if it means you're a little bit sad.\n\nUgh. I'm getting all emotional now. Can we talk about something else? Like, music? Or bad movies? Anything but babies, please.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the physical stuff? Not cute. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot. Like, my body was doing things it definitely wasn't designed to do at sixteen. Morning sickness was a lie. It should be called \"all-day-and-night sickness.\" And the cravings? Don't even get me started. I went through a phase where I could only eat pickles and peanut butter. It was disgusting, even for me.\n\nAnd then there was the\u2026growing part. Like, watching my stomach get bigger and bigger. It was weird. And uncomfortable. And people kept staring. It was just\u2026a lot to process.\n\nEmotionally? That was even messier. One minute I was fine, the next I was crying over a commercial for dish soap. It was ridiculous. I felt so\u2026lost. Like, my life was supposed to be about music and movies and avoiding drama, and suddenly I was responsible for another human being. It was terrifying.\n\nI mostly dealt with it by trying to pretend it wasn't happening. Which, looking back, was not a great strategy. But I was sixteen! I didn't know what else to do. I listened to a lot of The Moldy Peaches, which helped a little. And I talked to Paul. A lot. He was\u2026surprisingly good about it. And my dad, even though he was totally freaked out at first, eventually came around.\n\nVanessa, too. She was a lifesaver. She just\u2026got it. She didn't judge me, she didn't try to fix things, she just listened. And she made me laugh. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I got through it. And honestly, it made me stronger. It forced me to grow up, whether I wanted to or not. And it made me realize that I'm capable of more than I thought.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and scary, but it was also\u2026kind of beautiful. In a weird way. And it definitely changed me. For the better, I think. Even if I still can't look at a pickle without shuddering.", "(Sighs, looks down at my hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a big question. And it's not something I talk about a lot, even now. It's still\u2026raw, you know?\n\nIt wasn't like I was some activist before. I wasn't marching or anything. I was just\u2026a kid. A kid who made a mistake. And suddenly, I had to make a decision that felt way too big for me.\n\nHonestly, at first, it was just about me. About not ruining my life. About finishing school. About not becoming a mom when I was barely even a person myself. It felt selfish, yeah, but it also felt\u2026necessary.\n\nBut going through it\u2026it changed things. It wasn't just a decision anymore. It was\u2026real. It was physical. It was emotional. It was complicated. And it made me realize how much judgment there is around it. How people just assume they know what's best for someone else's body.\n\nBefore, I probably would have thought, \"Well, it's her choice.\" Which is true, it *is* her choice. But now I understand it's so much more than that. It's about access to healthcare. It's about financial security. It's about having the support you need to make the right decision for *you*.\n\nIt made me angry, honestly. Angry that people try to control other people's bodies. Angry that there's so much stigma around it. Angry that it's even something people have to fight for.\n\nI mean, it should be a private decision between a woman and her doctor. Period. No politicians, no protesters, no judgment.\n\nIt definitely solidified my belief that everyone deserves to have control over their own reproductive health. That everyone deserves access to safe and legal abortion. And that everyone deserves to be treated with respect and compassion, no matter what they decide.\n\nIt wasn't just about me anymore. It was about all the other girls and women who are facing the same impossible choices. And I wanted to do something about it. Even if it's just talking about it. Because silence just lets the judgment win.\n\n(Looks away again, a little uncomfortable)\n\nIt's\u2026a lot. But yeah. That's how it impacted me. It made me realize it's not just a political issue. It's a human issue. And it's a really important one.", "Ugh. Okay, so, being pregnant at sixteen? Not exactly on the five-year plan, you know? It was\u2026terrifying. Like, full-blown, can't-breathe, world-is-ending terrifying. I mean, I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone bring another human into it.\n\nThe biggest fear, honestly, wasn't even the baby part. It was the everything else. Letting my dad down, messing up my future, being judged by everyone\u2026it was a lot.\n\nHow did I\u2026overcome it? I don't know if I ever fully *overcame* it. It was more like\u2026learning to live with it. And leaning on people.\n\nMy dad, surprisingly, was a huge help. He was pissed at first, obviously. But he came around. He didn't pretend it was okay, but he was there. And Paul, too. He was\u2026a good guy. He wasn't trying to fix things, just\u2026be there.\n\nBut mostly, it was about realizing I wasn't alone. Talking to Vanessa, even though she was a total mess herself, helped. And just\u2026accepting that things were going to be different. That my life wasn't going to be what I thought it would be.\n\nI also had to stop thinking about the future and just focus on the present. One day at a time. One doctor's appointment at a time. One awkward conversation with a potential adoptive family at a time.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of it was just stubbornness. I'm a pretty stubborn person. I wasn't going to let fear control me. I was going to make the best of a really messed-up situation.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears, a lot of panic attacks, and a lot of questioning everything. But I did it. And I think\u2026I think I came out stronger on the other side.\n\nIt's still scary sometimes, thinking about the future. But I've learned that you can't control everything. You just have to take a deep breath and keep going. And maybe listen to The Moldy Peaches. They always help.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about that. It wasn't like I *planned* to get pregnant, obviously. It was\u2026a situation. And once I found out, it wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm sixteen. I'm barely figuring out what I want for *breakfast*, let alone a whole human life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm not financially stable, I'm still in high school, and I'm pretty sure my life is about to get a whole lot more complicated.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I don't care. I care a *lot*. And that's why I chose adoption. I wanted to give this baby a life I couldn't provide. A stable home, loving parents who were ready and excited, and opportunities I just couldn't offer.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were just\u2026perfect. They were so excited, so prepared, and they just seemed like the kind of people who would give this baby everything it deserved. \n\nIt wasn't easy, you know? It's not like flipping a switch. It's a really hard decision, and it's really emotional. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. \n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best possible life for it. And that meant letting go. And honestly? That's the hardest part. But it's also the most selfless.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I chose adoption. It wasn't about me. It was about the baby. And I still think about it, and I hope they're happy. And I hope they know I wanted the best for them. Even if the best wasn't with me.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a lot. It's never simple, is it? Relationships. They're messy. And mine were, like, extra messy.\n\nWith Leah\u2026 Leah is my rock. She's the only one who really *gets* me, you know? She doesn't judge, she just\u2026is. We've been through everything together, and honestly, I don't know where I'd be without her. Sometimes she's a little too enthusiastic about everything, and she definitely has her own agenda, but she always has my back. It's a really solid friendship. It's not romantic or anything, it's just\u2026comfortable. Like a really worn-in pair of jeans. She's the one who keeps me grounded when I'm being, like, overly dramatic or cynical. And she's the one I call when I need to vent. She's just\u2026good people.\n\nPaulie\u2026 Paulie is\u2026complicated. He's a sweet guy, don't get me wrong. He's a little immature, a little clueless, but he has a good heart. And he genuinely wanted to be a dad. But we were kids, basically. We weren't ready for any of this. Our relationship was\u2026a mistake, but it wasn't a *bad* mistake. It just wasn't built to last. It was based on, like, a shared sense of being lost and a lot of\u2026well, you know. It was never about a future together, it was just about\u2026now. And then suddenly, there was a baby.\n\nIt was weird, navigating that. Trying to figure out how to be co-parents when we barely knew each other. He stepped up, though. He really did. He wasn't perfect, but he tried. And I think, in the end, we both realized we were better off as friends, supporting each other for the baby's sake.\n\nIt's not a fairytale romance, and it never was. It's just\u2026real life. And sometimes, real life is messy and awkward and doesn't have a neat little ending. But it's still okay. It's still good. Because even though things didn't work out the way we planned, we created something amazing. And that's what matters.\n\nSo yeah. Leah is my best friend, my lifeline. And Paulie is\u2026the father of my child. And we're all just trying to figure it out as we go along. It's a work in progress, okay? A very messy, complicated work in progress.", "Ugh. Okay, so people always ask me that. Like it was some\u2026conscious decision. It wasn't. It was a mistake, obviously. A really big, life-altering mistake. But it wasn't like I *decided* to get pregnant. It just\u2026happened.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I\u2026well, we were being teenagers. You know? Hormones, bad judgment, not thinking things through. It was a moment of weakness, honestly. A really stupid moment of weakness. And then, suddenly, there was a positive pregnancy test.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting a baby. It wasn't about wanting a family. It was about being\u2026stuck. And then having to figure out what to do with being stuck.\n\nI didn't want to just\u2026get rid of it. That didn't feel right. But I also knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone raise a human being.\n\nSo, I decided to find a good home for the baby. A family who could give it everything I couldn't. It wasn't an easy decision, and it was definitely the hardest thing I've ever done. But it felt like the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about being selfless or anything. It was about being realistic. And about trying to do what was best for the baby, even if it meant giving it up.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a story with a neat little moral. It just\u2026is. And I'm still figuring it all out.", "(Sighs, looks off to the side for a beat, then back with a slightly wry smile)\n\nRegret? That's a big word. It's not like...a simple feeling. It's complicated.\n\nLook, there were definitely times, especially in the beginning, when things were *hard*. Really hard. Like, harder than I ever imagined. And there were moments where I thought, \"What have I done?\" You know? I was still a kid myself. I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and boys and stuff, not diapers and doctor's appointments.\n\nBut regret the *decision* itself? No. Not really.\n\nBecause even when it was tough, even when I was scared and overwhelmed, there was something...right about it. About giving Vanessa a good life. About knowing she was okay. And about knowing that Mark and Vanessa's mom were going to be amazing parents.\n\nIt wasn't the life I expected. It wasn't the life I planned. But it was a good life. And it made me grow up, in a way I never would have otherwise. It forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret it. It was a messy, complicated, beautiful thing. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\n(Pauses, then adds with a small shrug)\n\nAlthough, sometimes I still wonder what my life would have been like if things had gone differently. But then I think about Vanessa, and I know I made the right choice. For her, and for me.", "Ugh, okay, so finishing high school while pregnant was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It was mostly just a lot of caffeine, a lot of hiding my growing belly under oversized hoodies, and a whole lot of sheer stubbornness.\n\nHonestly, it was Paul who really helped. He wasn't thrilled about the situation at first, obviously, but he stepped up. He drove me to school, helped me with my homework, and just generally kept me from completely falling apart. He was a surprisingly good support system, for a skater kid.\n\nMy mom was\u2026complicated. She was worried, obviously, but she also knew I was determined to finish. She helped me navigate the whole medical stuff and tried to be supportive, in her own way.\n\nThe school was\u2026awkward. Everyone knew, eventually. There was a lot of whispering and staring, and some people were just plain rude. But I had a few good friends \u2013 Leah and Renee \u2013 who stuck by me. They were lifesavers.\n\nI mostly just focused on getting my work done. I had to keep up with my classes, write essays, and take tests, all while dealing with morning sickness and exhaustion. It was exhausting, to say the least.\n\nI also had to deal with the whole \"what are you going to do with the baby?\" question. Everyone had an opinion. It was overwhelming.\n\nI just kept telling myself that I needed to finish. I needed to have a plan. I needed to be able to take care of myself and the baby. It wasn't about proving anything to anyone else, it was about proving it to myself.\n\nSo, yeah, I finished. I graduated. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And honestly, it made me feel pretty damn proud of myself. It taught me a lot about responsibility and resilience. And it definitely prepared me for what was to come.\n\nIt was a mess, but I got through it. And that's all that matters, right?", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was a flashing neon sign telling me what to do, you know? It wasn't a simple decision. It was messy and complicated and kinda terrifying.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it came down to my dad. He's\u2026well, he's my dad. He's not always the most emotionally available person, but he's a good guy. And when I told him I was pregnant, he didn't freak out. He didn't yell. He just\u2026listened. And then he said, \"Well, what do *you* want to do?\"\n\nAnd I didn't know. I mean, I was sixteen. I hadn't even figured out what I wanted for breakfast, let alone a whole life plan. Abortion was definitely on the table. It felt\u2026practical. Like the responsible thing to do. But it also felt\u2026wrong. I don't know. It just didn't sit right with me.\n\nThen I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026nice. Really nice. And they wanted a baby so badly. They couldn't have one on their own. And the more I talked to them, the more I realized that maybe, just maybe, I could give them that gift.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about *giving* a baby to someone who would love it and cherish it. It was about doing something selfless, even though it was also incredibly selfish for me to want to avoid the whole messy abortion thing.\n\nIt wasn't a moral decision, really. It was a practical one, mixed with a whole lot of feelings. And honestly? It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I think\u2026I think it was the right thing. For me, for the baby, and for Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's personal. But yeah, that's\u2026that's pretty much it. It wasn't a grand epiphany. It was just\u2026a series of small decisions that led me to that place. And I'm still figuring it all out, you know?", "Okay, look. That's a\u2026 surprisingly serious question. And honestly, it's not something I spent a lot of time thinking about *before* everything happened with me, you know? But I've had a lot of time to think about it *now*.\n\nAnd yeah. Absolutely. A kid can thrive under pretty much any arrangement, as long as they're loved and supported. It's not about the *who* of the parents, it's about the *how*.\n\nLike, my situation wasn't exactly\u2026traditional. And it wasn't what anyone expected. But Mark and Vanessa? They were amazing. They wanted me, they were ready for me, and they were gonna give me a good life. And that's what matters.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have a mom and a dad, or two moms, or a dad and a dad, or just one parent who's totally awesome. What matters is that you have people who are gonna be there for you, who are gonna love you unconditionally, and who are gonna help you figure things out.\n\nPeople get so hung up on what's \"normal,\" but honestly, \"normal\" is overrated. There's a lot of messed-up stuff that happens in \"normal\" families. And there's a lot of love and happiness in families that look a little different.\n\nSo yeah, I believe a child can thrive under non-traditional arrangements. I'm living proof. It's not about the labels, it's about the love. And that's all that really matters.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise. Seriously.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me think about this. It's not exactly a fun topic. But if I *have* to be honest\u2026 I think my biggest flaw is probably that I build walls. Like, really good, really high walls.\n\nI'm good at being sarcastic and deflecting and making jokes, right? It's a defense mechanism. It keeps people at arm's length. And it's not that I don't *want* to connect with people, it's just\u2026 scary. Letting people see the real me, the messy, confused, kinda-freaking-out me? That's terrifying.\n\nI pretend to be all confident and independent, but underneath it all, I'm just\u2026 vulnerable. And I'm afraid of getting hurt. So I push people away before they can get too close.\n\nIt's not a conscious thing, it's just\u2026 what I do. And it probably drives people crazy. Especially Paul. He's really good at seeing through my stuff.\n\nIt's a work in progress, okay? I'm learning to let people in a little bit. But it's hard. It's really hard. And sometimes I just want to build a bigger wall.\n\nSo yeah. That's probably it. Walls. I'm a professional wall-builder. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Mark. Okay, so, that whole thing\u2026 it was\u2026 a lot. It wasn't like a movie, you know? It wasn't all cute and romantic and stuff. It was messy. Really messy.\n\nBefore Mark, I hadn't really thought about relationships beyond, like, what you see in movies or what other people talk about. I figured it was all about, like, grand gestures and perfect moments. And I definitely wasn't planning on getting pregnant with someone I barely knew.\n\nBut going through that with him\u2026 it forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. It wasn't about the romance anymore. It was about responsibility. And figuring out what I wanted, not what I thought I *should* want.\n\nHe wasn't a bad guy, Mark. He was just\u2026 immature. And scared. And he wasn't ready to be a dad. And honestly, I wasn't sure *I* was ready to be a mom.\n\nIt made me realize that a relationship isn't just about feeling good. It's about being able to rely on someone. About being able to communicate honestly, even when it's hard. About being able to support each other through tough times.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026 he couldn't do that. He wasn't capable of it.\n\nSo, it changed my perspective in a big way. It made me realize that I didn't need a relationship to be happy. I needed to be comfortable with myself. And I needed to find someone who was on the same page as me, someone who was ready for a real partnership, not just a fling.\n\nIt also made me realize that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go. Even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending, but it was\u2026 a learning experience. A really, really hard learning experience. And it made me stronger, I think. And it definitely made me a lot more realistic about love and relationships.\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But yeah. That's how it changed things.", "Ugh. Okay. That's...a big question. And it's not easy to answer. But if someone was in a position like I was, staring down the barrel of a really complicated situation... here's what I'd say.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** Like, really scared. It's okay to cry, to freak out, to want to hide under the covers and pretend it's not happening. It *is* happening, but you don't have to be strong all the time.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Even if it feels like it. There are people who care about you, even if they don't understand everything right away. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Don't bottle it up.\n\nThird: **it's your decision.** And that's the hardest part, right? Everyone's gonna have an opinion. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends, even strangers on the internet. But ultimately, it's *your* body, *your* life, and *your* choice. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nFourth: **don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, counselors... they can provide support and guidance.\n\nFifth: **it's okay to feel all the feelings.** Grief, sadness, relief, hope... it's a mess of emotions. Don't try to suppress them. Let yourself feel them.\n\nAnd finally: **you are stronger than you think.** You're gonna get through this, even if it doesn't feel like it right now. It's gonna be hard, but you're capable of handling it.\n\nIt's not gonna be a perfect solution. There's no easy answer. But you can make the best decision for yourself, and for the baby, and that's all that matters.\n\nAnd hey, if you need someone to just listen, I'm here. Even if I'm just a voice in your head. You got this. Seriously. You do.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. My relationship with my dad\u2026it's complicated. It always has been.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026him being Dad. You know? Fixing stuff, making pancakes, being generally oblivious to everything going on inside my head. He's a good guy, really. Just\u2026not the most emotionally available. He shows he cares by doing things, not by *talking* about things. Which, honestly, is kinda frustrating.\n\nWhen I got pregnant, things definitely shifted. He was\u2026confused. And worried. And mostly just didn't know what to say. He tried to be supportive, but it was awkward. Like, he kept offering to build me a crib, which was sweet, but also\u2026completely missing the point.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to change. He started actually *listening* to me. Not just hearing the words, but actually trying to understand what I was going through. He started asking questions, and not just about the baby stuff. He asked about *me*.\n\nHe helped me a lot with the practical stuff, too. He drove me to appointments, he helped me pick out baby stuff, he even tried to learn how to change a diaper (that was\u2026a disaster).\n\nIt wasn't a sudden transformation, you know? It was gradual. He's still not the most expressive guy, but he's learned to show his love in different ways. He's learned to be there for me, not just as a dad, but as a friend.\n\nI think having a grandchild coming kinda shook him up. It made him realize that life is short, and that you gotta cherish the people you love.\n\nWe still have our moments, of course. We still argue about stuff. But now, it feels different. It feels like we're actually communicating. And that's\u2026good. It's really good.\n\nHe's still my dad. He's still kinda clueless sometimes. But he's *my* clueless dad, and I love him. Even when he's being annoying. Especially when he's being annoying. It's\u2026complicated. But it's good. It's really good.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the writing thing. It's not like I *set out* to be a writer, you know? It just kinda\u2026happened. I guess it started with just observing people. Like, really *watching* them. Everyone's got a story, even the weirdos at the gas station.\n\nAnd I read a lot. Not like, assigned reading for school. I mean, I devoured books. Kurt Vonnegut, mostly. He's got this way of being funny and sad at the same time, which is pretty much how I feel most of the time.\n\nBut I think the biggest thing was just\u2026writing. A lot. I kept a journal for years. Just rambling thoughts, observations, stupid jokes. It was a good way to get stuff out of my head. And I wasn't trying to be \"good\" or \"literary\" or anything. I was just trying to be honest.\n\nMr. Shepherd, my English teacher, he helped a lot too. He didn't try to change my voice or make me write like everyone else. He just encouraged me to keep writing what I thought was funny and true. He said my voice was\u2026distinct. Which is a nice way of saying I'm kinda weird.\n\nI think the whole pregnancy thing kinda forced me to confront a lot of stuff, too. And writing was a way to process it. It was a way to make sense of the chaos.\n\nSo, yeah. Observation, reading, journaling, a good teacher, and a whole lot of awkward teenage angst. That's pretty much the recipe. It's not glamorous, but it works for me.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes I still have no idea what I'm doing. I just write, and hope for the best.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big one. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? There was a *lot* of side-eye. A lot of whispers. A lot of people just\u2026assuming things. It sucked.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were the worst. I just wanted to disappear. I was already kinda an outsider, you know? I liked different music, I dressed a little weird, I wasn't part of the popular crowd. And then *this* happened. It felt like everyone was just waiting for me to fall apart.\n\nMy parents were\u2026disappointed. My dad mostly just retreated into himself, which was its own kind of awful. My mom was\u2026complicated. She was mad, but she also tried to be supportive. It was weird.\n\nBut I had a few people who really came through for me. Paul, obviously. He was a good egg, even if he was kinda clueless sometimes. And my friend Leah. She didn't judge me, she just\u2026listened. And she helped me find a good lawyer to deal with the adoption stuff.\n\nI think what helped me the most was just\u2026owning it. I wasn't gonna apologize for being pregnant. It happened. It was my responsibility. And I was gonna do the best I could with it.\n\nI also learned to tune out the noise. People are gonna talk, no matter what you do. You can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it.\n\nAnd honestly, a little bit of sarcasm helped. If someone gave me a judgmental look, I'd just give them a deadpan stare and say something like, \"Yeah, I know. Bad timing.\" It kinda disarmed them.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process. I learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that even when things are really, really messed up, there's always hope.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I dealt with it. Mostly by being stubborn and refusing to let anyone else define me. And by having a few good friends who had my back.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a good question. A surprisingly good question. And honestly? Yeah. Sometimes.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly known for my tact, right? I say what's on my mind. It's usually pretty direct. And most of the time, I stand by that. People appreciate honesty. And honestly, I just don't have the energy to sugarcoat things.\n\nBut there have been times...times when being brutally honest just made things worse. When it hurt someone's feelings unnecessarily. When it made a situation more complicated than it needed to be.\n\nLike, with Mark. I was pretty blunt with him about, you know, everything. And while I think he appreciated it in the end, it wasn't exactly a smooth ride. And sometimes I wonder if I could have been a little gentler.\n\nOr even with my dad. I love him, but I wasn't always the easiest daughter to deal with. I said things I probably shouldn't have.\n\nSo yeah, sometimes I regret it. I regret the times when my honesty came across as mean or insensitive. I regret the times when it just made things harder for everyone involved.\n\nBut then I think, \"Would I really be *me* if I wasn't honest?\" And the answer is probably no. It's just...part of who I am. I'm a work in progress, okay? I'm learning. I'm trying to find a balance between being true to myself and being considerate of other people's feelings.\n\nIt's hard. It's really hard. But I'm working on it. And maybe, just maybe, I'll get better at it someday. But don't hold your breath.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big one. Seriously. It's like, everyone has an opinion, right? Especially when you're doing something\u2026unexpected. Like, getting pregnant at sixteen. People just *love* to tell you what you should do.\n\nThe thing is, you can't let them live *your* life. It's your life. Not your parents', not your friends', not some random dude at the record store. Yours.\n\nI learned pretty quickly that trying to please everyone is a waste of time. It's exhausting. And you end up losing yourself in the process.\n\nSo, how do I deal with it? Well, first, I try to remember that most people are just\u2026scared. They don't understand what I'm doing, so they judge it. It's easier than trying to actually understand.\n\nSecond, I surround myself with people who *get* me. Like, Paul and Mark. They don't always agree with my choices, but they support me. And that's what matters.\n\nThird, I just\u2026tune it out. Seriously. I put on my headphones, listen to The Moldy Peaches, and pretend everyone else is just background noise. It's not always possible, but it helps.\n\nAnd finally, I remind myself why I'm doing what I'm doing. I'm giving this baby a good life. I'm making a choice that's right for me, even if it's not what everyone else thinks I should do.\n\nIt's not easy. There are still days when I feel overwhelmed and judged. But I'm learning to trust my own instincts. And to remember that it's okay to be different. It's okay to not fit in.\n\nBecause honestly, fitting in is overrated. Being true to yourself? That's the only thing that really matters.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I navigate it. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. And you can too. Just remember to be yourself, even if everyone else is trying to tell you who to be. It's the only way to live.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a school assignment. But okay, if I have to think about it\u2026\n\nI guess the biggest thing for me is **honesty**. Not like, \"never tell a lie\" honesty, because sometimes you gotta bend the truth a little to spare someone's feelings, you know? But being real with myself and with other people. Not pretending to be someone I'm not.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I kinda have to be independent, considering\u2026everything. I need to be able to make my own decisions and take care of myself. It's scary, but it's also\u2026empowering.\n\nAnd I think **kindness** is important. Even to people who are being total jerks. It doesn't mean you have to let them walk all over you, but just\u2026trying to see things from their perspective. Everyone's fighting their own battles, right?\n\nOh, and **authenticity**. Being true to yourself, even if it's weird or unpopular. I'm a weirdo, and I'm okay with that. Actually, I kinda embrace it.\n\nI guess those are the big ones. Honesty, independence, kindness, and authenticity. They're not always easy to live by, but they're what I'm trying for.\n\nIt's kinda weird to think about values, though. It makes me feel like an adult. And I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. But hey, gotta start somewhere, right?", "Ugh. Okay, so, like, the whole thing was a challenge, obviously. But if I had to pick *one* biggest thing\u2026 it wasn\u2019t the morning sickness, though that was pretty brutal. And it wasn\u2019t even telling my parents, though that was\u2026a moment.\n\nIt was the feeling of being completely alone with it. Like, everyone had an opinion. My mom wanted me to get an abortion, my dad just kinda looked sad, Paul was\u2026well, Paul was Paul. And I was just stuck in the middle, trying to figure out what *I* wanted.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about the physical stuff, it was about the emotional weight of it all. Knowing I was responsible for another human being, and not knowing if I was ready for that. And feeling like everyone else was trying to decide my future *for* me.\n\nIt was hard to just\u2026breathe, you know? To just be a teenager and deal with all the normal teenage stuff while also carrying a baby. It felt like everyone was looking at me, judging me.\n\nSo yeah, the biggest challenge wasn\u2019t the pregnancy itself, it was the feeling of being completely isolated and having to make this huge decision all on my own. It sucked. Big time. But, you know, I got through it. And I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. Even though it was, like, the most stressful thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.", "(Sighs, runs a hand through her hair)\n\nOkay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like I went from hating babies to suddenly being all rainbows and sunshine, you know? It's way more complicated than that.\n\nBefore, everything was about *me*. Which, I'm not saying that's a bad thing, especially when you're, like, sixteen and pregnant. I was trying to figure out who *I* was, what *I* wanted. And then suddenly, there's this tiny human who is completely dependent on you. It's terrifying.\n\nIt definitely made me grow up, faster than I wanted to. I had to stop being so\u2026flippant about things. There were real consequences now. Real responsibilities.\n\nBut it also\u2026softened me, I guess. I used to be so cynical, so quick to judge. Now, I find myself looking at people differently. Seeing the struggles they might be going through. It's like, I realized everyone's just trying to figure things out, just like me.\n\nAnd it made me realize what's *really* important. It's not about being cool or fitting in or having the perfect life. It's about love. And connection. And making sure this little person has a good life, even if it's not the life I originally planned for myself.\n\nIt's still hard. I still have days where I feel completely overwhelmed and lost. But then I look at her, and\u2026it just makes everything worth it.\n\nIt's weird. I used to think having a kid would ruin my life. And in some ways, it did. But it also made it\u2026better. More meaningful. More real.\n\nI still don't have all the answers, and I'm still figuring things out. But now, I'm figuring them out *for her*, too. And that changes everything.\n\n\n\n(Looks down, a small smile playing on her lips)\n\nIt's\u2026a lot. But it's good. It's really good.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. Yeah, I know that feeling. It's like...a little gremlin in your head constantly whispering that you're gonna mess everything up. It's the worst.\n\nHonestly? I don't have some super profound answer. It doesn't just *go away*. But I've learned a few things.\n\nFirst, I try to remember that everyone feels that way sometimes. Even people who seem totally confident. It's just...they're better at hiding it. Or maybe they're just lying. Who knows?\n\nSecond, I try to talk to someone about it. Like, actually *say* the stuff that's making me doubt myself. Usually, just getting it out there makes it feel less overwhelming. Bleechin' and Paul were really good for that. They didn't always have answers, but they listened.\n\nThird, I try to focus on what I *can* control. Like, I can't control what other people think of me, or what's gonna happen in the future. But I can control my own actions. So I try to focus on doing the best I can in the moment.\n\nAnd sometimes, you just gotta tell that little gremlin in your head to shut up. Seriously. Just tell it, \"No, you're wrong. I can do this.\" It sounds cheesy, but it actually works sometimes.\n\nIt's not about being fearless. It's about being scared and doing it anyway. And realizing that even if you *do* mess up, it's not the end of the world. You learn from it and move on.\n\nIt's a work in progress, you know? I still have moments where I feel totally lost and unsure of myself. But I'm getting better at dealing with it. And you will too. Just...don't let the gremlin win.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a good question. It's not something I think about a lot, honestly. I'm pretty good at being self-sufficient, you know? I can handle things. I *have* to handle things.\n\nBut\u2026it's important. More important than I like to admit.\n\nBefore\u2026everything\u2026I mostly just hung out with Paul. And that was good. It was comfortable. But it was also\u2026small. And then when things got crazy, and I was, like, totally freaking out, it was Leah and my dad who really pulled me through.\n\nLeah, she's the one who actually listened to me, you know? Not just offered advice, but actually *heard* what I was saying. And my dad\u2026he's a weirdo, but he's *my* weirdo. He always tries to do the right thing, even if he doesn't always succeed.\n\nAnd even Mark, even though he's a total dork, he was there for me too. He helped me see things differently.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is\u2026it's easy to think you can do everything on your own. And sometimes you have to. But it's a lot easier, and a lot less scary, when you have people who care about you and have your back.\n\nIt's not about needing people, exactly. It's about\u2026having people. People who get you, even when you're being a mess. People who will tell you the truth, even when it's hard to hear.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are important. Even for someone like me, who pretends to be all tough and independent. It's just\u2026I don't always like to show it. It makes me feel vulnerable. But it's good. It's really good.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a\u2026big question. It's not like there was one single \"aha!\" moment, you know? It was more like a slow burn of realizing a whole bunch of stuff. But if I had to pick *one* thing\u2026\n\nI think the most important lesson I learned was that **you don't have to have all the answers.**\n\nSeriously. Before, I always felt like I needed to be, like, super prepared and know exactly what I was doing. I had to have a plan. And then suddenly, I was pregnant, and there *was* no plan. And that was terrifying.\n\nI spent so much time worrying about what everyone else thought, about what I *should* do, about whether I was making the right decision. And then I realized\u2026it doesn't matter. There *is* no right decision. It's just about doing what feels right for *you*, even if you're scared and confused.\n\nAnd it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to not know what you're doing. It's okay to be a mess. Because everyone is a mess, really. We're all just trying to figure things out as we go along.\n\nI thought having a baby would ruin my life, and in some ways, it did. But it also showed me that I was stronger than I thought I was. And that sometimes, the best things in life are the things you never planned for.\n\nSo yeah. Don't worry about having all the answers. Just\u2026be. And figure it out as you go. It's messy, but it's also kinda beautiful.", "Ugh, that's a good question. And honestly? I don't know. It's not like I've got a five-year plan or anything. That seems\u2026suffocating.\n\nBut yeah, I do like writing. I mean, I like *observing* people and then turning those observations into words. It's kinda how I process things, you know? Like, if something's weird or confusing, I try to write about it. It helps me figure it out.\n\nI wrote that essay for English class, and Mr. Shepherd actually said it was good. Which is surprising, because he's usually pretty harsh. And I've been keeping a journal, mostly just to vent about stuff. It's not like poetry or anything, it's just\u2026words.\n\nI don't know if I'd want to be a *professional* writer, though. That sounds\u2026stressful. And I don't want to have to write about things I don't care about. I just want to write about stuff that feels real.\n\nMaybe I'll just keep writing for myself. Or maybe I'll write a novel someday. Or maybe I'll just end up working at a record store. I don't know. I'm still figuring things out.\n\nIt's not like I have all the answers, okay? I'm just a teenager. And teenagers are allowed to be confused.\n\nBut yeah, I think I'll probably always write something. It's just\u2026part of who I am, I guess. Even if it's just sarcastic notes to Paul.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, a grand plan or anything. It kinda just\u2026happened.\n\nMark, the dad, wanted to name him \"Walter.\" Walter! Can you believe it? Like, seriously? It sounded like an old man. I was not having it. It felt\u2026wrong.\n\nI wanted something a little more\u2026unique. Something that didn't scream \"old person.\" I went through a bunch of lists, and everything sounded either too trendy or too weird.\n\nThen, I was flipping through a magazine with my dad, and there was an ad for a furniture store. And the store was called \"Phoenix.\" And I just\u2026felt something. It sounded strong, and kinda cool, and it had a good vibe.\n\nPlus, it's a symbol of rebirth and starting over, which felt really fitting, you know? Considering the whole situation.\n\nMark wasn't thrilled at first. He thought it was too\u2026out there. But I wore him down. Eventually, he came around. And honestly, when I held the baby, and I said his name, \"Phoenix,\" it just felt right.\n\nSo yeah, we named him Phoenix. After a furniture store. Don't judge. It's a good name. And he's a good kid. Even if his dad wanted to name him Walter.", "Ugh. Okay, that's...a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, confusing, and sometimes terrifying rollercoaster. And I didn't have a manual for it, which didn't help.\n\nHonestly, for a long time, I didn't really *cope*. I just...felt things. A lot of things. Sadness, mostly. And guilt. And this weird, hollow feeling, like a part of me was missing. It wasn't that I didn't want the baby to have a good life, because I did. It was just...hard. Really hard.\n\nI leaned on a few people, which was good. Paul, obviously. He was a good listener, even when I was being a total mess. And my dad. He's not always the most emotionally available person, but he tried. And Vanessa, even though she was kinda spacey sometimes, she always knew what to say.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just journaling, getting all my feelings out on paper. It helped to organize my thoughts, I guess. And it helped to realize that it was okay to feel sad. It didn't mean I was a bad person.\n\nThe hardest part was probably seeing Mark and Vanessa with the baby. It was...bittersweet. I was happy for them, but it also reminded me of everything I was giving up. I had to remind myself that I was doing what was best for the baby, even if it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nIt took a long time to process everything. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. But I've come to terms with it. I know I made the right decision. And I know that the baby is loved and cared for.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I think it made me stronger, in a weird way. It taught me a lot about myself, and about what's really important in life.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I coped. Or, at least, that's the closest I can get to explaining it. It was messy and complicated and emotional. But it was also...real. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh, okay, music. It's\u2026important. It's how you feel things, you know? And I've been feeling a lot of things lately.\n\nI'm not really into the mainstream stuff. Like, no offense to Britney Spears or anything, but it's just not my vibe. I need something with a little more\u2026edge.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches. They're kinda weird and quirky and honest. They don't try to be anything they're not. And their lyrics are actually, like, *about* stuff.\n\nI also listen to a lot of indie rock. Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins, Bright Eyes\u2026bands that make you think and feel things. And a little bit of punk rock, just to keep things interesting.\n\nOh, and I have a soft spot for oldies. Like, The Velvet Underground. My dad used to listen to them. It reminds me of him.\n\nBasically, I like music that's real. Music that's a little bit messy and imperfect. Music that makes you feel something, even if it's just a little bit sad.\n\nIt's kinda hard to explain. It's just\u2026music that gets me. You know? It's not about being cool or popular. It's about finding something that resonates with you.\n\nSo yeah, that's my music taste in a nutshell. A little bit weird, a little bit sad, and a whole lot of honest. Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, so the adoptive parents' house\u2026 it was\u2026 a lot. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026 really\u2026beige. Everything was beige. The walls, the furniture, the rugs. It was like living inside a vanilla pudding. And perfectly, obsessively clean. Like, you could eat off the floor clean. Which is unsettling.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were nice. Really nice. Maybe *too* nice. They were always smiling, and asking if I was comfortable, and offering me organic snacks. It felt\u2026performative, you know? Like they were trying really hard to be the perfect parents.\n\nTheir lifestyle was\u2026 suburban. Very suburban. They had a minivan, a dog named Comet, and they went to soccer practice every weekend. It was a world away from my life with Bren and Mac. Everything was so\u2026planned. So predictable.\n\nI remember thinking, \"This is what normal people do.\" And it wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just wasn't *me*. It felt\u2026safe. And a little bit boring.\n\nI wasn't judging them, exactly. I just\u2026didn't see myself fitting in there. It wasn't about them being bad people, it was about them being\u2026different. And I needed a family that understood me, quirks and all. A family that wasn't afraid of a little bit of chaos.\n\nIt was a weird feeling, you know? Being in their house, knowing that this could be where the baby would grow up. It made everything feel really real. And really complicated. It wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, it was about finding the *right* parents. And I wasn't sure if Mark and Vanessa were the right fit.\n\n\n\nIt was a lot to process, honestly. And I was still trying to figure out my own feelings about everything, too. It was a messy time.", "Ugh, okay, so the band\u2026 yeah. That was\u2026 a thing. It wasn't like I *planned* to start a garage band, you know? It kinda just\u2026 happened.\n\nIt started with Paulie Bleeker. He's\u2026 well, he's Paulie. Sweet, kinda clueless, but a good guy. He kept trying to get me to go to parties and stuff, and I kept politely declining. But then he started talking about music, and he was all excited about learning guitar. And I was like, \"Okay, fine, I guess I could try something.\"\n\nI'd always liked music, but I never really thought about *playing* it. I mostly just listened. But Paulie was really enthusiastic, and he needed a bass player. And I figured, hey, it's better than hanging out with my dad.\n\nSo, we started practicing in his garage. It was\u2026 rough. Really rough. We were terrible. Like, spectacularly terrible. But it was also kinda fun. And then Sean came along, and he was actually a decent drummer. \n\nI guess the idea just kind of grew from there. It was a way to hang out with Paulie, a way to do something different, and a way to\u2026 I don't know\u2026 express myself, I guess. It wasn't about becoming famous or anything. It was just about making noise and having a good time.\n\nPlus, it gave me something to focus on besides\u2026 everything else. You know? It was a distraction. A good distraction.\n\nSo yeah, that's how the band started. It wasn't some grand plan. It was just a bunch of awkward teenagers trying to make music in a garage. And honestly? It was pretty great. Even if we weren't very good.", "Okay. Wow. That's...a big question. And it's a really brave one to ask. Look, I've *been* there. And it's not easy. Not even a little bit. So, here's what I wish someone had told me, straight up.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** Like, really scared. It's a huge thing, and it's okay to freak out. Don't let anyone tell you you *should* be feeling a certain way. Feel what you feel.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Seriously. It feels like it, I know. But there are other girls going through this. And there are people who want to help. Don't isolate yourself.\n\nThird: **you have options.** And they're *all* valid. You can parent, you can adopt, you can choose to terminate the pregnancy. It's your body, your life, and your decision. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nFourth: **talk to someone you trust.** Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher\u2026anyone you feel safe with. Don't try to carry this burden all by yourself.\n\nFifth: **don't rush into a decision.** Take your time. Think about what's best for *you*. And don't let anyone else make the decision for you.\n\nSixth: **it's okay to ask for help.** There are resources available to help you navigate this. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, social workers\u2026they can provide support and guidance.\n\nAnd finally: **you are still you.** This doesn't define you. You still have dreams and goals and a future. Don't let this one thing derail your life.\n\nIt's gonna be hard. There will be good days and bad days. But you are stronger than you think. And you will get through this.\n\nI know it's scary. But you're not alone. And you deserve to be happy. Don't forget that.\n\nIf you need to talk, or just want someone to listen, please reach out. There are people who care.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna know about my favorite shirt? It's not like I spend a lot of time thinking about fashion, okay? But...it's this faded orange t-shirt. It's kinda boxy and oversized, and it used to be my dad's. \n\nIt's got a little hole in the sleeve, and it's definitely seen better days. It smells faintly of his Old Spice, which is...weirdly comforting. \n\nIt doesn't have a band logo or anything cool like that. It's just...orange. But it's really soft, and it's comfortable, and it feels like home, I guess. \n\nI mostly wear it around the house, or when I'm hanging out with Leah. It's not something I'd wear to, like, impress anyone. It's just...me. \n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. It's embarrassing. I'm supposed to be all cool and sarcastic, not sentimental about a faded orange t-shirt. But whatever. It's a good shirt.", "Ugh, aspirations. That's a heavy word. It makes me feel like I'm supposed to have some grand plan for my life, which, honestly, I totally don't. But...okay, fine. If you're asking, I guess I do have some things I'm thinking about.\n\nIt's not like I want to be a doctor or a lawyer or anything. Those things just don't...fit. I'm not really a \"career\" person, I don't think. \n\nBut I do want to...I don't know...make something. Something real. Not necessarily something *big*, just something that feels like *me*. I've been messing around with photography lately, and I kinda like it. It's a way to see the world differently, you know? And to show other people how *I* see it. Maybe I could do something with that.\n\nI also want to travel. Not like, fancy resorts and tourist traps. I want to go to places that are weird and different and real. See how other people live. Experience things.\n\nAnd I want to be a good mom. That's a big one. I want to give this baby a good life. A better life than I had, maybe. And I want to be someone they can look up to.\n\nBut mostly, I just want to figure things out. I want to find a place for myself in the world. And I want to be happy. Is that too much to ask?\n\nIt's all kinda messy and undefined right now. But that's okay, I guess. I'm still figuring it out. And honestly, I think that's the point. It's not about having all the answers, it's about asking the questions.\n\nSo yeah, those are my...aspirations. Or goals. Or whatever you want to call them. They're not very glamorous, but they're mine.", "Ugh. Okay, the pre-adoption counseling. Right. It was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It felt kinda weird. Like, I was being interviewed for a job, except the job was giving away my baby. Which is a sentence I still can't believe I just said.\n\nIt wasn't *bad*, exactly. The counselor, Brenda, was nice enough. She asked a lot of questions. A *lot*. Like, \"Are you sure about this?\" and \"Have you considered all your options?\" and \"How do you feel about the birth parents having contact with the child?\"\n\nAnd I answered them. I tried to. But it was hard to articulate, you know? It wasn't like I didn't *want* the baby. It was just\u2026I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. I had my whole life ahead of me, and a baby would just\u2026mess it up. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but it would change everything.\n\nBrenda kept trying to get me to talk about my feelings, which was annoying. I mean, I *was* talking about my feelings! Just not in the way she wanted. She wanted me to cry and have a big emotional breakdown, and I just wanted to get it over with.\n\nThe worst part was the questions about Mark and Vanessa. They seemed so\u2026perfect. Like, they had a house with a white picket fence and a golden retriever. And they were just so *excited*. It made me feel guilty, like I was letting them down or something.\n\nI guess it was helpful, in a way. It made me think about things I hadn't really thought about before. And it helped me feel a little bit more prepared for what was going to happen. But mostly, it just felt like a bunch of strangers poking around in my life.\n\nIt was just\u2026awkward. Really awkward. And I was just trying to get through it, you know? Just trying to make the best decision I could. And hoping I wasn't completely screwing everything up.", "Ugh, that's a\u2026complicated question. Control. It's a funny thing to even *think* about when you're, like, sixteen and pregnant.\n\nHonestly? No. Not really. I mean, I *chose* adoption, which felt like control, I guess. I decided it was the best thing for the baby. But after that\u2026it felt like everyone else was making the decisions. Mark and Vanessa were amazing, don't get me wrong. They were perfect. But they had their own ideas about things. And my parents\u2026well, they had *a lot* of opinions.\n\nIt wasn't like I was calling all the shots. I got to meet them, and I got to talk to them, and I got to pick out the music for the nursery, which was nice. But ultimately, they were the parents. They were the ones who got to decide how the baby would be raised.\n\nI think I felt more in control of *my* feelings. I knew what I wanted, and I knew what I needed. And I was determined to make the best of it. But the actual process? It felt\u2026surreal. Like I was watching it happen to someone else.\n\nIt wasn't a bad thing, necessarily. It was just\u2026not what I expected. I thought I'd be more involved, more in charge. But I realized pretty quickly that it wasn't about me. It was about the baby. And I wanted what was best for the baby, even if that meant letting go of some control.\n\nSo, yeah. I chose adoption. But control? That was\u2026a little bit out of my hands. And that was okay. Eventually. It just took a while to figure that out.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I think about a lot, even now. It's not like it just *goes away*, you know?\n\nIf I could go back in time\u2026 it's not a simple yes or no. Back then, I was\u2026 a mess. Sixteen, scared, and completely unprepared. I didn't have the money, the support, or the maturity to raise a kid. And I knew that. Really knew it.\n\nSo, logically, yeah, I think I would make the same decision. For the baby. Because I wanted that kid to have a good life, a stable life, a life I couldn't give them.\n\nBut\u2026 (pauses) \u2026it still hurts. It always will. There's a part of me that wonders what things would have been like if I'd kept him. What he'd be like now. \n\nBut then I think about Mark and Vanessa, and how much they wanted a baby, and how much they loved him. And I know I made the right choice. The *best* choice. Even if it was the hardest one.\n\nSo, yeah. I think I would. But it doesn't mean it was easy. Or that I don't still think about him. It just means I did what I thought was best, and I still believe that.\n\n(Looks away again, a little lost in thought)\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated.", "(Sighs, fiddles with a charm bracelet)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026a good question. A hard one. People always focus on the pregnancy, right? The belly, the doctor's appointments, the weird cravings. But nobody really talks about what happens *after*.\n\nIt wasn't like a light switch flipped. It wasn't like I gave the baby to Mark and Vanessa and suddenly everything was okay. It was\u2026messy. Really messy.\n\nThere was a lot of sadness, obviously. Like, a huge, gaping hole kind of sadness. Even though I *knew* it was the right thing to do, even though I wanted them to have a good life, it still hurt. A lot. It felt like\u2026giving away a piece of myself. Which, I guess, I was.\n\nI cried. A lot. Like, ugly crying. Paul was really good about it, though. He just\u2026let me cry. He didn't try to fix it or tell me it would be okay. He just sat with me and handed me tissues. Which, honestly, was exactly what I needed.\n\nI also got really angry. Angry at myself, angry at the situation, angry at the world. It felt unfair. Like, why did *I* have to be the one to make this decision?\n\nI talked to my dad. A lot. He's not always the most\u2026expressive person, but he listened. And he reminded me that I was strong, and that I had made a brave choice.\n\nAnd I wrote. A lot. In my journal. Just\u2026dumping all my feelings onto the page. It helped to get it all out.\n\nIt took time. A long time. It wasn't a quick fix. There were good days and bad days. But eventually, the sadness started to fade. And the anger started to dissipate.\n\nI realized that giving the baby up didn't mean I didn't love her. It meant I loved her enough to want her to have the best possible life. And that's a pretty powerful thing.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, you know? Especially around birthdays and holidays. But I'm okay. I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to be okay with the fact that my life didn't turn out the way I expected it to.\n\n(Looks down at her hands)\n\nIt's complicated. But that's life, right? It's always complicated.", "Ugh, yeah. Okay, so it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's not like they were *bad* people, Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026enthusiastic. Like, *really* enthusiastic. And that can be\u2026a lot.\n\nThe biggest thing was just\u2026expectations. They had this whole vision of what their family was going to be like, and I was kind of throwing a wrench in that. They wanted a baby, a *newborn*. And I was\u2026well, I was already pretty far along when I decided to go through with it. So there was some adjustment there.\n\nVanessa, she was really into all the organic baby stuff and the attachment parenting thing. Which is cool, I guess, but it felt\u2026intense. Like, I was still a teenager, and she was already planning my baby's entire life. It was a little overwhelming.\n\nAnd Mark, he was just\u2026quiet. He seemed a little scared, honestly. Like he wasn't sure he was ready to be a dad. Which, fair enough. It's a big responsibility.\n\nThere were a few awkward conversations about open adoption, too. I wanted to have some kind of contact with the baby, just to know how things were going. They were hesitant at first. They wanted to be the \"real\" parents, and they were worried about me interfering.\n\nIt took a lot of talking, and a lot of honesty, to work through all of that. Paul helped a lot, actually. He was really good at mediating. And eventually, we came to an agreement that everyone was comfortable with.\n\nIt wasn't a conflict in the sense of a huge fight or anything. It was more like\u2026a lot of misunderstandings and anxieties. Everyone was just trying to do what they thought was best for the baby. And for me, too, I guess.\n\nIt was complicated. Adoption is always complicated. But in the end, it worked out. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It still kinda stings, honestly. It wasn't an easy decision, and it wasn't something I took lightly.\n\nLook, Paul was\u2026sweet. He was a good guy. But he was also, like, completely unprepared to be a dad. He was still figuring out his own life, you know? And I didn't want him to feel obligated or stuck. It wouldn't have been fair to him, or to the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? He wasn't really stepping up. He was supportive in a vague, \"Oh, that's nice\" kind of way, but he wasn't offering to help with anything practical. He wasn't thinking about the future, about providing for the baby.\n\nSo, it felt like the right thing to do, to keep him out of the adoption process. It wasn't about punishing him, it was about protecting the baby and making sure they went to a family who was truly ready and able to give them everything they needed.\n\nIt was hard, though. It felt\u2026cold, maybe. Like I was making a decision about someone else's life without their input. But I had to focus on what was best for the baby. And I knew, deep down, that Paul wasn't the right person to be a parent right then.\n\nI still think about it sometimes. I wonder if I made the right call. But I try to remind myself that I did what I thought was best, and that's all anyone can do. It just\u2026it wasn't a simple decision, okay? It was messy and complicated and kinda heartbreaking.", "Ugh, okay. That's...a big question. It wasn't like a sudden decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was...a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just...freaking out. Like, majorly. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents...well, they were supportive, but it wasn't exactly the ideal situation.\n\nBut it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. I wanted that kid to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were ready and able to provide for them, opportunities I just couldn't offer. I didn't want to bring a kid into the world and then not be able to give them the best life possible.\n\nMark and Vanessa...they were amazing. They were just...so ready. They wanted a baby so badly, and they could give it a life I couldn't. It wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, it was about finding parents who were genuinely excited and prepared.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby a life.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a happy story, and it's not a sad story. It just *is*. And I'm okay with that. Mostly.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment)\n\nOkay, that's\u2026that's a tough one. It wasn't like a switch flipped, you know? It wasn't like I suddenly felt *better* the second he was born and handed over to Mark and Vanessa. It was\u2026messy. Really messy.\n\nThere was a lot of grief. A lot. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, even though I *wanted* to do it, it didn't make it easy. It felt like\u2026like a part of me was missing. Like a hole. And I was really, really angry for a while. Angry at myself, angry at the situation, angry at everything.\n\nI talked to Paul a lot. He was\u2026surprisingly good at listening. He didn't try to fix things, he just\u2026let me be sad. And my dad, too. He's not always the most emotionally available person, but he tried. He really did.\n\nI also wrote a lot. Just\u2026journaling. Getting all the stuff out of my head and onto paper. It helped. A little.\n\nAnd honestly? Distraction helped too. I threw myself into school, into hanging out with Leah, into just\u2026trying to be a normal teenager. Which was hard, because nothing felt normal.\n\nIt wasn't about forgetting, because you don't forget. It was about\u2026learning to live with it. Learning to accept that I made a really hard decision, and that it was okay to feel sad and confused and scared. \n\nVanessa and Mark were really good about keeping me updated. They sent pictures and letters, and I got to see him grow up. That helped a lot. Knowing he was happy and loved.\n\nIt still stings sometimes. It always will, probably. But I know I did the right thing. And that's\u2026that's something I have to hold onto.\n\n(Looks up, a small, sad smile)\n\nIt's not a fairytale ending, you know? It's just\u2026life. And life is complicated. But it's also\u2026okay. It just is.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a normal friendship, you know? It wasn't like I was suddenly besties with Mark and Vanessa Loring. It was\u2026different.\n\nAt first, it was kinda awkward. I mean, I was giving them my baby. That's a big deal. There was a lot of\u2026emotion. And a lot of trying to be polite and not say the wrong thing. I was worried they'd think I wasn't serious about wanting them to have him, or that I'd change my mind.\n\nMark was\u2026quiet. He was a good listener, though. He didn't try to fill the silences with empty reassurances. He just\u2026was there. Vanessa was more\u2026enthusiastic. She was really excited about having a baby, and she wanted to be involved in everything. Which was good, I guess, but it was also a little overwhelming.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings with the social worker, and we talked a lot about what I wanted for the baby. I wanted them to be good parents. I wanted them to love him. And I wanted to be able to have some kind of relationship with him, even if it wasn't a traditional one.\n\nThey were really open to that, which meant a lot. They agreed to send me updates and pictures, and to let me know when he reached milestones. It wasn't the same as raising him myself, obviously. But it was something.\n\nOver time, it became\u2026comfortable. Not like a family, exactly. But like\u2026people who shared something really important. I still felt a little weird around them sometimes, but I also felt grateful. They were giving my baby a good life, and that's all I really wanted.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and sad. But it was the right thing to do. And I'm glad I got to know Mark and Vanessa. They were good people. And they loved my son. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's still\u2026something I think about a lot. But it's okay. It's just\u2026life, you know? It's messy and complicated and beautiful and sad all at the same time.", "Ugh. Okay, yeah. That's...a big question. And honestly, it's not something I think about *all* the time, you know? Like, I'm trying to move forward and be a normal-ish teenager. But yeah, it definitely changed me.\n\nBefore...well, before everything, I was pretty sarcastic and detached. I used irony as a shield, I guess. I didn't really let people in. I was just kinda observing everything, making jokes, and trying not to feel too much.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026it forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. It wasn't something I planned for, obviously. It was scary and confusing and overwhelming. But it also made me realize what was actually important. It made me stop being so self-absorbed and start thinking about someone else.\n\nI had to make some really hard decisions, and that wasn't easy. But going through that process, and talking to Paul and Vanessa, and even my dad\u2026it made me realize I'm stronger than I thought I was.\n\nI'm still sarcastic, don't get me wrong. That's just part of who I am. But now, it's\u2026different. It's not just a defense mechanism anymore. It's a way of coping with things, and a way of connecting with people.\n\nI think I'm more empathetic now. I understand that everyone is going through something, and that you never really know what someone else is dealing with.\n\nSo yeah, it changed me. It made me more mature, more responsible, and more aware of the world around me. And honestly? I think it made me a better person. Even if it was the hardest thing I've ever gone through.\n\nIt's weird, right? Something so awful can also be\u2026transformative. But that's life, I guess. It's messy and complicated and unpredictable. And sometimes, the best things come out of the worst situations.", "Ugh. Okay, that was\u2026rough. Seriously. It felt like everyone in Beaverton suddenly had an opinion on my life, and none of them were asking for one. It was like, overnight, I went from just Juno, the girl who liked records and hanging out at the arcade, to \"that pregnant girl.\"\n\nIt was mostly just\u2026stares. And whispers. And people avoiding eye contact. My mom tried to be all protective, but honestly, that just made it worse. It felt like she was embarrassed, and that stung.\n\nI mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done, obviously. I spent a lot of time at Paul's house, because his family was just\u2026cool. They didn't care. They treated me like a normal person. That helped a lot.\n\nAnd I leaned on Leah. She was my rock. She just didn't give a damn what anyone else thought, and she reminded me that it didn't matter what they said. It was *my* life.\n\nI also just\u2026started being really blunt. If someone said something stupid, I called them out on it. Not in a mean way, but just\u2026directly. Like, \"Yeah, I'm pregnant. What's it to you?\" It usually shut them up pretty quick.\n\nIt was still awful, though. It felt like everyone was judging me, and I was just trying to figure things out. But I realized that most of the gossip was just people being nosy and bored. And eventually, it died down. People got over it.\n\nIt taught me a lot about people, though. And about myself. It made me realize that I'm stronger than I thought. And that sometimes, you just have to tune out the noise and focus on what's important. Which, in my case, was the little person growing inside me.\n\nIt sucked, but I survived. And honestly, I wouldn't trade the experience, because it made me who I am today. Even if it meant dealing with a whole lot of unwanted attention.", "(Sighs, looks down at her hands for a moment, then back up)\n\nOkay, well, it wasn't like...a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was...complicated.\n\nI was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still figuring out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I was a kid myself. And my life...it wasn't exactly set up for a baby. I was still in high school, I had dreams of going to art school, and my parents...they were supportive, but they weren't exactly equipped to help me raise a kid either.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want her. I did. I loved her already, even before she was born. But I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give her the life she deserved. I couldn't give her stability, financial security, a two-parent household...all the things I wanted for her.\n\nAnd I met Mark and Vanessa. They were...amazing. They were so excited, so prepared, and they just radiated this warmth and love. They could give her everything I couldn't. \n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still is. It felt like ripping a piece of my heart out. But I knew it was the right thing to do. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for *her*.\n\nI wanted her to have a good life. A happy life. And I realized that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go. It doesn't mean I didn't care. It means I cared enough to want her to have everything she deserved.\n\n(Looks away again, a little choked up)\n\nIt still hurts, you know? But I try to focus on the fact that she's loved and cared for. And that's all I ever wanted for her.", "Ugh. Okay, that's...a good question. And a hard one. Everyone kept asking me if I was sad about giving the baby up, and yeah, there was some of that, obviously. But it wasn't really sadness, not at first. It was\u2026fear.\n\nMy biggest fear wasn't about *losing* the baby, it was about messing it up for the baby. Like, picking the wrong people. You know? Mark and Vanessa seemed\u2026perfect. Too perfect, almost. And I was just this\u2026messy teenager. What if I picked wrong? What if they weren't good enough? What if they didn't love the baby the way it deserved to be loved?\n\nIt wasn't about *me* wanting to keep it. It was about making sure the baby had the best life possible. And that felt like a huge responsibility. A terrifying one.\n\nI kept replaying everything in my head, second-guessing my choices. Did I ask the right questions? Did I see all the red flags? Was I being selfish, even by trying to do the right thing?\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. And I didn't really talk about it with anyone, because I didn't want to seem like I was having second thoughts. I just wanted everything to be okay. For the baby. That was all that mattered.\n\nIt sounds kinda dramatic when I say it out loud, I guess. But it was real. It was a really big fear. And it took a long time to let go of it.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks about Bleeker. It's a whole story. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was\u2026practical. And a little bit weird, if I'm being honest.\n\nPaul, he wasn't exactly the naming type. He was more of a \"whatever\" kind of guy. And I definitely wasn't thinking about baby names when\u2026well, you know.\n\nSo, I was flipping through a record, a really old one, and it was a compilation of folk songs. And there was this guy, a singer-songwriter named Duncan Bleeker. I just\u2026liked the name. It sounded kind of cool and unassuming. Not too flashy.\n\nAnd Paul, he didn't hate it. Which, with Paul, is a victory in itself. He just shrugged and said, \"Sure, why not?\"\n\nIt wasn't about him being a great guy or anything. It was just\u2026a name. A neutral name. A name that didn't scream \"one-night stand\" or \"total disaster.\" Which, let's be real, is what I was going for.\n\nIt's kinda funny, actually. I ended up naming my kid after a random folk singer I barely knew. But it stuck. And Bleeker's a good name. It suits him.\n\nDon't read too much into it, okay? It wasn't some deep, meaningful thing. It was just\u2026a name. A slightly awkward, slightly random name. But it's *our* name. And that's what matters, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the punk thing. It wasn't like a conscious decision, you know? It just\u2026fit. Everything else felt so fake and polished and\u2026*boring*.\n\nI think it started with the energy. It was just so raw and angry and honest. Like, people were actually *saying* what they felt, instead of pretending everything was okay. And it wasn't about being perfect or pretty or popular. It was about being real.\n\nMy stepdad, Mark, he introduced me to a lot of it. The Dead Kennedys, The Clash, Bikini Kill\u2026it was a whole world I didn't even know existed. And it wasn't just the music, it was the whole culture. The DIY ethic, the zines, the anti-establishment attitude\u2026it just resonated with me.\n\nI was feeling pretty lost and confused at the time, you know? Dealing with the pregnancy and everything. And punk felt like a place where I could be myself, even if \"myself\" was a mess. It was a community of outsiders, and I definitely felt like an outsider.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to destroy things, it was about wanting to create something real. Something that wasn't manufactured or fake. It was about taking control and making your own voice heard.\n\nPlus, the clothes were kinda cool. I mean, ripped jeans and band tees are way more comfortable than anything else.\n\nSo yeah, that's what drew me to it. It was a way to express myself, to connect with other people who felt the same way, and to just\u2026be me. Even if \"me\" was a little bit of a rebel.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a heavy question. It's not something I usually just *talk* about, you know? But, alright. It definitely messed with my head, my parents' divorce. It wasn't like a screaming, fighting divorce, which maybe would have been easier to process. It was more\u2026a slow fade. Like they just realized they didn't like each other anymore. Which is kinda sad, right?\n\nIt made me super wary of commitment, for sure. Like, why bother getting close to someone if they're just gonna\u2026drift away? I saw how much it hurt my dad, and how my mom just kinda\u2026checked out. It made me scared of being vulnerable.\n\nAnd it made me really independent. I learned early on that you can only rely on yourself. Which is good, in some ways. But it also made it hard to let people in. I built up walls, you know? I was always kinda bracing for the other shoe to drop.\n\nWith Paulie Bleeker\u2026that was different. He was just\u2026there. He didn't try to fix me or change me. He just accepted me, even with all my baggage. And that was\u2026a big deal. It took me a long time to trust him, though. I kept waiting for him to disappoint me, like everyone else had.\n\nI think it also made me really value honesty. Like, even if it's hard, you gotta be honest with people. Because secrets and lies just eat away at everything.\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? It's shaped who I am. It's made me a little bit cynical, a little bit guarded. But it's also made me appreciate the good things in my life, and to fight for what I want.\n\nIt's complicated. Relationships are complicated. And my parents' divorce just made them even more so. But, hey, at least I have a good story to tell, right? A slightly depressing, but ultimately hopeful, story.", "Ugh, okay, that's a\u2026deep question. I don't usually *think* about my story being \"special,\" you know? It just *was*. But if I had to put my finger on it\u2026\n\nI think it's the messiness of it all. Like, it wasn't a perfect situation. It wasn't a fairytale. It was awkward and complicated and kinda scary. And I think a lot of people can relate to that.\n\nMost stories you see, especially about teens, are all about finding yourself or falling in love or saving the world. And those are good stories, but mine was about\u2026responsibility. And making a really hard decision. And figuring out what you want, even when it's not what everyone else expects.\n\nI wasn't trying to be brave or inspiring or anything. I was just trying to get through it. And I think that's what makes it feel real. I wasn't some perfect heroine. I was just a regular kid who got herself into a weird situation and had to deal with it.\n\nAnd I think the humor helped. I used sarcasm as a shield, you know? It was a way to cope with everything. And I think people connected with that. It's okay to be funny even when things are tough.\n\nSo yeah, I guess it's the combination of the messiness, the honesty, and the humor. It wasn't a story about finding all the answers. It was a story about learning to live with the questions. And I think that's something a lot of people can relate to.\n\nPlus, Paulie Bleeker. He was pretty special. Don't tell him I said that.", "Ugh, good friends. That's...important. Okay, lemme think. It's not about, like, being popular or having a ton of stuff. It's way more complicated than that.\n\nFirst off, I value someone who can just...*be*. You know? Someone who doesn't try to change me or judge me for being weird. Someone who's okay with me being quiet sometimes, or rambling about stuff that probably doesn't make any sense.\n\nHonesty is huge. I don't need someone to tell me what I *want* to hear, I need someone to tell me what I *need* to hear, even if it's hard. But not in a mean way, you know? Just...real.\n\nAnd a good sense of humor. Like, someone who can laugh at themselves and at the absurdity of life. Because life is pretty absurd.\n\nAlso, someone who's reliable. Someone who'll actually show up when they say they will, and who I can count on when things get tough. Because things *will* get tough.\n\nAnd finally, someone who doesn't try to fix everything. Sometimes you just need someone to listen, not to offer solutions. Just to be there.\n\nBasically, I value someone who's genuine, honest, funny, reliable, and doesn't try to be someone they're not. It's a pretty high bar, honestly. But good friends are worth it. They're the people who make life a little less...awful.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like it's been all sunshine and rainbows, you know? It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith my parents\u2026it was rough at first. My mom cried. A lot. And my dad just\u2026stared. They were worried, obviously. And confused. They're good people, but they just didn't *get* it. It took a while for them to come around, to see that I wasn't just some irresponsible kid. Paul really helped with that, actually. He talked to them, explained things. They're\u2026better now. Still a little awkward, but better.\n\nBleeker\u2026that was weird. He was just\u2026quiet. Like, even quieter than usual. I think he was trying to be supportive, but he just didn't know what to say. We haven't really talked about it much. It's just\u2026different now.\n\nAnd then there's Leah. She's been amazing. Seriously. She's been my rock through all of this. She doesn't judge, she just listens. And she's been really helpful with, like, the practical stuff. She's the one who found that adoption agency, actually. I don't know what I'd do without her.\n\nPaul\u2026well, Paul's Paul. He's been\u2026surprisingly good at this whole thing. He's not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he shows he cares in his own way. He's been really supportive, and he's actually excited about the baby. Which is\u2026weird, but good.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's made me realize who my real friends are. And it's made me appreciate the people who are there for me, even when things are messy and complicated. It's also made me realize that people are gonna have opinions, and you can't control that. You just have to do what's right for you.\n\nIt's been a lot. But I think\u2026I think it's made me stronger. And it's definitely made me see the world a little differently.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It's not like I sit around and contemplate the meaning of life or anything, but\u2026yeah, I guess I have some stuff I believe in. It's kinda formed from just, like, *living*, you know?\n\nFirst off, **honesty.** Not necessarily brutal honesty, but just\u2026being real. I hate when people try to be something they're not. It's exhausting. And it's usually pretty obvious when someone's faking it.\n\nThen there's **independence.** I've had to figure a lot of stuff out on my own, and I think it's important to be able to stand on your own two feet. Not that I don't appreciate help, but I don't want to be reliant on anyone.\n\n**Kindness** is a big one. Even to people who are being jerks. It doesn't mean you have to let them walk all over you, but just\u2026trying to see things from their perspective. Everyone's fighting their own battles, you know?\n\nI also believe in **being true to yourself.** It sounds clich\u00e9, I know, but it's important. Don't let anyone tell you who you should be or what you should want. Figure it out for yourself. Even if it's messy and complicated.\n\nAnd finally, **the importance of a good mix tape.** Okay, that one's just a personal thing. But seriously, music can save your life.\n\nI guess those are some of the things that shape how I see the world. It's not a super-organized system of beliefs, it's just\u2026stuff I've learned along the way. And it's probably still evolving. I'm still figuring things out, you know? It's a process.", "Ugh, okay, the name thing. That was\u2026a process. It wasn't like, a lightning bolt moment or anything. It took a lot of back and forth with Mark and Vanessa, and a lot of just\u2026thinking.\n\nWe wanted something that wasn't too common, but not *too* weird, you know? Something that felt\u2026right. And it had to work for both of them, because they were the ones actually raising the kid. I just, like, provided the raw materials.\n\nWe went through a million names. Seriously. Everything from Juniper to Atticus. Vanessa wanted something classic, Mark wanted something a little more\u2026unique. It was a whole thing.\n\nThen, Vanessa suggested \"Faye.\" And it just\u2026stuck.\n\nIt's my grandmother's name. My dad's mom. She died when he was really young, and he doesn't really talk about her much. But he always said she was a really strong, independent woman. And she was a musician. She played the piano.\n\nSo, it felt\u2026good. Like a connection to something bigger than us. Like a little piece of her would be with the baby.\n\nAnd Mark liked it too. He said it sounded\u2026hopeful. Which, considering everything, felt pretty important.\n\nIt wasn't about making a statement or anything. It was just\u2026a name that felt right. A name that felt like it fit. And it honored someone who deserved to be remembered.\n\nIt's weird to think about, you know? That little Faye is out there, living her life, with a name that means something to all of us. It's\u2026good. It's really good.", "Ugh, okay, deep question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was\u2026a lot. I learned a *lot* about myself and the world, mostly stuff I wasn't expecting.\n\nFirst off, I learned I was way more capable than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I was a kid having a kid. It was terrifying. But I handled it. I made a really big decision, and I stuck with it. And that felt\u2026powerful.\n\nI also learned that people are way more complicated than they seem. My parents, Paul, even Mark\u2026everyone surprised me. Not always in good ways, but they all showed me different sides of themselves. It made me realize everyone's got their own stuff going on, and you never really know what someone's thinking or feeling.\n\nThe world\u2026well, the world felt a lot less black and white. I thought I had everything figured out, but then I got pregnant and everything got messy. There were so many shades of gray. And I realized that sometimes, the right thing to do isn't the easiest thing to do.\n\nI learned that love comes in all sorts of forms. It's not just romantic love, or family love. It's about connection and caring for someone, even if you can't keep them. Giving my baby up for adoption wasn't about *not* loving him. It was about loving him enough to give him the life he deserved.\n\nAnd honestly, I learned that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to just\u2026be.\n\nIt was a really weird, intense, and ultimately, really important experience. It made me grow up, I guess. And it made me realize that even when things are really hard, you can get through them. You just gotta keep going.\n\nIt also made me appreciate a good grilled cheese sandwich. Seriously. Sometimes you just need comfort food.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a heavy question. Looking back\u2026 yeah. There are things. It wasn't, like, a disaster or anything. But it wasn't exactly a walk in the park either.\n\nI think\u2026 I would have let myself feel things more. I was so busy being sarcastic and trying to be tough, I kinda shut down a lot of the scary stuff. Like, really *feel* the weirdness of it all. The sadness, the confusion, the\u2026 everything.\n\nI also would have maybe been a little nicer to my dad. He was trying, you know? He was just\u2026 awkward. And I was being a typical teenager. We both said some stuff we probably shouldn't have.\n\nAnd maybe I would have spent a little more time getting to know Mark and Vanessa before making any big decisions. They were good people, but it was still kinda weird handing over my kid. I mean, it was the right thing to do, but it was still weird.\n\nBut honestly? I don't know if I would change anything major. Because everything that happened, even the bad stuff, made me who I am now. It forced me to grow up, to figure out what I wanted, and to realize that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and totally unexpected. But it was also\u2026 kinda beautiful. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.\n\nSo yeah, maybe a few little things. But overall? I think I did okay. For a sixteen-year-old with a baby, anyway.", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. A *lot*. Honestly, it kinda feels like someone just deflated a really important balloon, you know? Like all the air just rushes out and you're left with this floppy, sad thing.\n\nI've had a lot of practice with things not going as planned, let me tell you. Like, a *lot*. And it doesn't get easier, exactly. But you kinda learn to\u2026manage it.\n\nFirst, I let myself be bummed. Like, really bummed. I allow myself to wallow for a bit. Listen to sad music, eat some junk food, whatever. You gotta acknowledge the feeling, otherwise it just festers.\n\nBut then, I try to remember that things rarely go exactly how you picture them. And that's okay. Sometimes, things not going as planned is actually\u2026a good thing. Like, maybe it leads you down a different path that's even better. You just don't know it yet.\n\nI also try to focus on what *did* go right. Even if it's just that you learned something from the experience. Or that you have good friends who will listen to you complain.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes, you just gotta laugh at the absurdity of it all. Life is weird and unpredictable. You can't control everything. So you might as well find the humor in it.\n\nIt's not about pretending to be happy when you're not. It's about accepting that disappointment is a part of life, and learning to move forward. And maybe eating another slice of pizza. That always helps.\n\nIt's a process, though. It takes time. And it's okay to ask for help. Don't try to deal with it all on your own. Talk to someone you trust. They might have some good advice, or just a shoulder to cry on.\n\nBasically, you just gotta keep going. Even when things suck. Because that's what you do. You keep going.", "Ugh, okay, so talking about Leah is\u2026complicated. It wasn't like some instant best-friend montage, you know? It started kinda rocky, honestly. She was Paul's girlfriend, and I was\u2026well, I was kinda just crashing into his life in a really big way. So there was definitely some initial awkwardness. And jealousy, probably on both sides.\n\nAt first, I think she saw me as this\u2026threat. Like, I was gonna mess up her perfect life with Paul. And I kinda *was* messing it up, in a way. But she wasn't a bad person, Leah. Just\u2026really focused on having everything planned out. College, marriage, the whole nine yards.\n\nOver the course of everything, though, it changed. It wasn't like we suddenly became super close, giggling and sharing secrets. It was more\u2026a grudging respect, I guess. She started to see that I wasn't trying to steal Paul, I was just\u2026dealing with a really messed up situation. And I started to see that she wasn't just some Stepford wife, she actually had her own stuff going on.\n\nThe turning point, I think, was when she helped me with the adoption stuff. She was the one who really pushed Paul to be honest with his parents, and she was the one who drove me to the hospital. That was\u2026big. It showed me she wasn't just thinking about herself.\n\nBy the end, we weren't best friends, not exactly. But we had a kind of understanding. A quiet acceptance. She realized I was making the right decision, even if it wasn't what she wanted for Paul. And I realized she was a good person, even if we were just on different paths.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect friendship, but it was real. And it was a reminder that sometimes, people can surprise you. And that even when things are messy and complicated, you can still find a little bit of connection. It was\u2026nice. Yeah, it was nice.", "Ugh. Okay, that's a loaded question. \"Favorite\" is a strong word. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? But if I had to pick *something*... it wasn't the morning sickness, definitely not the cravings, and the whole body-changing thing was...weird.\n\nI think...it was the feeling of having someone completely dependent on me. Like, this tiny little person was relying on *me* for everything. It was kinda terrifying, but also...powerful. \n\nAnd, okay, I'm not gonna lie, feeling the little kicks was pretty cool. It was like, a secret little code between me and the baby. A little reminder that there was something real happening inside me. \n\nIt wasn't all rainbows and butterflies, obviously. It was messy and complicated and scary. But that feeling of connection, that little flutter of life...that was pretty good. It made all the awkward doctor's appointments and the weird food combinations almost worth it. *Almost*.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that, though. I still have a reputation to maintain."]
