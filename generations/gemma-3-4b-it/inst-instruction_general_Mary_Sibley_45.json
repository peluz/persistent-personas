The solution lies in recognizing that the new line segment must be perpendicular to both original lines. This is the key to minimizing the maximum distance.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the solution:\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/(-5) = 1. The equation is y - 3 = 1(x - 3), or y = x.\n\n**2. Find the Perpendicular Line:**\n\nSince the new line segment must be perpendicular to both original lines, its slope must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of either line. The slope of Line 1 is 4, so the slope of the perpendicular line is -1/4.\n\n**3. Determine the Equation of the Perpendicular Line:**\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line, the equation of the perpendicular line is: y - 0 = (-1/4)(x - 0), or y = (-1/4)x. (We can set the y-intercept to 0 for simplicity.)\n\n**4. Find the Point of Intersection:**\n\nTo find the point where the perpendicular line intersects Line 1, set the equations equal to each other:\n\n4x - 3 = (-1/4)x\n16x - 12 = -x\n17x = 12\nx = 12/17\n\nNow, find the corresponding y-value: y = 4(12/17) - 3 = 48/17 - 51/17 = -3/17\n\nSo, the point of intersection is (12/17, -3/17).\n\n**5. The Solution:**\n\nThe line segment connecting the points of intersection of the original lines with the perpendicular line is the solution.  Therefore, the line segment connects the points:\n\n*   (1, 1) to (12/17, -3/17)\n*   (5, 5) to (12/17, -3/17)\n*   (3, 3) to (12/17, -3/17)\n*   (-2, -2) to (12/17, -3/17)\n\nThe maximum distance from any point on either original line to this new line segment will be minimized by drawing this perpendicular line.\n\n(I shift slightly, my gaze fixed on a point beyond the window.)\n\nThe key insight is recognizing that minimizing the *maximum* distance requires a line that is perpendicular to both original lines.

This carries risk.\n2.  **Community Assistance (High Priority):** Approach a neighbor, acquaintance, or local business. Explain your situation honestly and politely.
