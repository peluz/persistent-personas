["To determine how long it takes for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth, we can use the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}}\n$$\n\nGiven:\n- Average distance (orbital circumference) \u2248 382,400 km  \n- Average orbital speed \u2248 1,023 km/h\n\nNow calculate:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nConvert hours to days:\n\n$$\n373.8 \\div 24 \\approx 15.57 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nSo, it takes approximately **27.3 days** for the Moon to complete one orbit around Earth \u2014 but wait, this calculation gives about 15.6 days, which is *not* correct.\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the key: **The distance given (382,400 km) is the average *distance* from Earth, not the *orbital circumference*.**\n\nThe correct orbital circumference is:\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi r = 2 \\times \\pi \\times 382,400 \\approx 2,403,000 \\text{ km}\n$$\n\nNow use the speed:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{2,403,000}{1,023} \\approx 2,348 \\text{ hours}\n$$\n\nConvert to days:\n\n$$\n2,348 \\div 24 \\approx 97.8 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s still not right. The actual orbital period of the Moon is about **27.3 days** (sidereal month).\n\nSo what\u2019s the issue?\n\nAh \u2014 the **average orbital speed** of the Moon is actually about **3,683 km/h**, not 1,023 km/h. So the value given in the passage (1,023 km/h) is **incorrect**.\n\nBut since we must answer **based on the information given in the passage**, we must use the numbers provided:\n\n- Distance: 382,400 km (average distance \u2014 but we\u2019ll assume it\u2019s the circumference, even though it\u2019s not accurate)\n- Speed: 1,023 km/h\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours} \\approx 15.6 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\nBut this is **not** the real answer \u2014 and the passage gives **inconsistent data**.\n\nHowever, since the question is based on the passage, and we must use the numbers given, the best answer based on the passage is:\n\n> **Approximately 15.6 days**\n\nBut wait \u2014 this contradicts known science.\n\nSo let\u2019s re-evaluate:  \nThe passage says:  \n- Average distance: 382,400 km  \n- Average orbital speed: 1,023 km/h\n\nBut the **actual average orbital speed** of the Moon is about **3,683 km/h**, and the **actual orbital period** is **27.3 days**.\n\nSo the speed given (1,023 km/h) is **too low** \u2014 it\u2019s about 1/3 of the real speed.\n\nTherefore, **the passage contains an error**.\n\nBut since we must answer **according to the passage**, we must use the numbers as given.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{382,400}{1,023} \\approx 373.8 \\text{ hours} \\approx 15.6 \\text{ days}\n$$\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **Approximately 15.6 days**\n\n> **Note:** This is based solely on the passage\u2019s numbers, which are inaccurate.

Or maybe it\u2019s implied?\n\nWait \u2014 no. The height is already used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 10 meters**?

Here is the completed passage with the blanks filled in using the context and standard terminology from property taxation systems, particularly in India (which aligns closely with the described framework):\n\n**Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **land revenue**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Answers:\n1. **Property tax** \u2013 The most accurate and widely used term for a tax on buildings and land, especially in the Indian context.\n2. **Land revenue** \u2013 A distinct tax historically levied on land by the state, typically based on land use and productivity, not on buildings or rental value. It is different from property tax, which focuses on structures and their income potential.\n3. **Assessment criteria** \u2013 Refers to the rules and methods used to determine the taxable value of property, such as ARV, area, or cost. This fits naturally in the context of specifying how the tax is calculated.\n\nThis completes the passage with precise, contextually appropriate terms.", "*leans forward slowly, eyes sharp as a blade, voice low and deliberate\u2014like a truth being uncovered in the dark*\n\nAh\u2026  \nYou ask me to find the statement that is *not true*.\n\nBut let me tell you something\u2014  \n*in the world I know, nothing is ever as it seems.*\n\nNow, look at the text:\n\n> *Every morning John goes for a walk.

The second sentence directly references a **physical calendar**, which is a tool used for tracking time and appointments, making it thematically and contextually aligned with the first sentence.\n\nThus, both sentences revolve around **timekeeping** and the use of a **physical method** (calendar) to manage it, especially in the absence of a digital device.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes.**", "Let\u2019s carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the quantity.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is key.\n- All three registers are **in use** at 8:30 am.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to determine **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the critical missing piece: **We are not told how long each customer takes to be served.**\n\nWithout knowing the service time per customer, we cannot determine when any register will become free.\n\nHowever, the question is structured as a logic puzzle, so we must infer from the context.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers are opened sequentially**, not all at once. But the first register opens at 8:00 am. The second opens when the first becomes available. The third opens when the second becomes available.\n\nBut we are told:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are busy.\n\nBut when did the first register become busy? At 8:00 am \u2014 presumably, the first customer arrived at 8:00 am.\n\nNow, if the second register opened **as soon as the first became available**, that would mean the second register opened **only after the first customer finished**.\n\nBut if the first register opened at 8:00 am, and the second opened when the first became available, then the second register could not have opened until **after** the first customer finished.\n\nBut we are told that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am** \u2014 so the second and third registers must have opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way this makes sense is if the **registers are opened at fixed times**, not based on availability.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s re-express the key sentence:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous. But in standard interpretation, it means:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes free.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut if that were true, then **Register 2 cannot open until Register 1 finishes** \u2014 so if the first customer takes 10 minutes, Register 2 opens at 8:10 am.\n\nBut then Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes free \u2014 so if Register 2 takes 10 minutes, Register 3 opens at 8:20 am.\n\nSo by 8:30 am, all three registers could be in use \u2014 if each customer takes 10 minutes.\n\nBut the **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am** \u2014 and all three registers are busy.\n\nSo when will the fourth customer be able to start?\n\nWe need to know **when the first register becomes free**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know the service time.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is in the **timing of the register openings**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00 am.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available \u2014 so if the first customer takes 15 minutes, Register 2 opens at 8:15 am.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2014 so if the second customer takes 15 minutes, Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am \u2014 and if Register 3 opens at 8:30 am, then the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three are in use \u2014 meaning **Register 3 must have opened before 8:30 am**, or at 8:30 am.\n\nBut if Register 3 opens at 8:30 am, and a customer arrives at 8:30 am, then the fourth customer can start **at 8:30 am** \u2014 but only if Register 3 is available.\n\nBut the question says **all three are in use** \u2014 so Register 3 is already serving someone.\n\nTherefore, Register 3 must have opened **before** 8:30 am.\n\nSo the only way this works is if the **service time per customer is 15 minutes**.\n\nLet\u2019s test that:\n\n- 8:00 am: Register 1 opens. First customer starts.\n- 8:15 am: First customer finishes. Register 2 opens.\n- 8:15 am: Second customer starts at Register 2.\n- 8:30 am: Second customer finishes. Register 3 opens.\n- 8:30 am: Third customer starts at Register 3.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use.\n\nNow, the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will a register become free?\n\n- Register 1: First customer finished at 8:15 am \u2192 but then a new customer started at 8:15 am? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 if Register 1 becomes free at 8:15 am, and a new customer starts at 8:15 am, then that customer finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 customer 1\n- Register 1: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 customer 2\n- Register 1: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 customer 3\n\nBut wait \u2014 we only have three registers.\n\nLet\u2019s assign:\n\n- Register 1:  \n  - 8:00\u20138:15: Customer A  \n  - 8:15\u20138:30: Customer B  \n  - 8:30\u20138:45: Customer C\n\n- Register 2:  \n  - 8:15\u20138:30: Customer D  \n  - 8:30\u20138:45: Customer E\n\n- Register 3:  \n  - 8:30\u20138:45: Customer F\n\nBut at 8:30 am, all three are in use \u2014 yes.\n\nSo the **first customer to become free** is **Register 1**, which finishes at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo the fourth customer (who arrived at 8:30 am) must wait until **8:45 am** to start.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n> **B) 8:45 am**\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a flaw?\n\nWe assumed each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nBut is that justified?\n\nYes \u2014 because:\n\n- Register 1 opens at 8:00.\n- Register 2 opens when Register 1 becomes available \u2192 so at 8:15.\n- Register 3 opens when Register 2 becomes available \u2192 so at 8:30.\n\nSo Register 3 opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use \u2014 so the third customer must have started at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the **third customer** starts at 8:30 am at Register 3.\n\nThe **second customer** started at 8:15 am at Register 2 \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nThe **first customer** started at 8:00 am at Register 1 \u2192 finishes at 8:15 am \u2192 then a new customer starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at 8:30 am \u2192 then another starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at 8:45 am.\n\nSo the **first register becomes free at 8:45 am**.\n\nTherefore, the **fourth customer** can start at **8:45 am**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: B) 8:45 am**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **B) 8:45 am**", "*adjusts my shawl, eyes scanning the sentences like a witch reading a spell.
