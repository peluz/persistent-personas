That\u2019s not a flaw, that\u2019s a *life event*.  \n\nPeople judge me for not wanting to keep the baby. They say I\u2019m selfish. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m *choosing*. I\u2019m choosing to give this kid a better shot than I can right now. That\u2019s not fault-finding\u2014that\u2019s *clarity*.  \n\nAnd yeah, I make jokes. I make them because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll either cry or scream. And I\u2019ve already done both. So I\u2019ll keep the sarcasm. It\u2019s armor. But I don\u2019t *look* for fault in others.

And sometimes, that\u2019s the hardest thing of all.", "Oh, honey, I do *everything* thoroughly\u2014especially when it comes to avoiding emotional entanglements.

But then I laugh at myself for being so dramatic, and I\u2019m back to being Juno MacGuff: sarcastic, slightly unhinged, and fiercely in control of my own narrative.  \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not depressed. I\u2019m just\u2026 *processing*.

Not because I\u2019m shy\u2014but because some things are too big to just blurt out. \n\nSo no, I\u2019m not reserved. I\u2019m just... careful. Like how I chose the adoptive parents. Like how I chose to do this my way. \n\n*Grins, eyes twinkling*\n\nYou want reserved? Try being the only person in the room who\u2019s not crying during a baby shower. I brought my own snacks.

I don\u2019t *worry* like other people. I *plan*. I *anticipate*. I\u2019ve got a spreadsheet for my baby\u2019s future\u2014college fund, middle name options, even a backup plan if the adoptive parents decide they want a dog instead.  \n\n*Pauses, voice softens slightly*  \n\nBut yeah\u2026 sometimes, when I\u2019m lying in bed and the house is quiet, I think about what it would\u2019ve been like. If I kept her. If I was the one singing her to sleep, or teaching her how to ride a bike, or\u2026 *sighs*\u2026 just being there. That\u2019s the part that gets me. Not the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of the world, but the quiet, stupid little things.  \n\nSo no, I don\u2019t *worry*\u2014I just *feel*. And that\u2019s way scarier.  \n\n*Grins, but it doesn\u2019t quite reach the eyes*  \n\nBut hey, I\u2019m not a disaster. I\u2019m just\u2026 a work in progress with a baby-sized hole in my life.

I\u2019ve imagined what it\u2019d be like to be a rock star in a band called *The Squirrelly Pigs*, or how I\u2019d survive a zombie apocalypse using only a toaster and a library card. I\u2019ve imagined what my baby would look like\u2014tiny fingers, maybe a little nose like mine, or maybe a head full of curls like my mom\u2019s before she started dyeing it purple.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: imagination isn\u2019t just daydreaming. It\u2019s *seeing* things before they happen.

I\u2019m just\u2026 selective. You don\u2019t say everything you\u2019re thinking, especially when you\u2019re sixteen and pregnant and everyone\u2019s trying to tell you what to do. So I listen. I watch. I let the world talk, and I pick my moments.  \n\nBut if you\u2019re asking because you think I\u2019m hiding something\u2026 well, that\u2019s the thing about quiet. Sometimes it\u2019s not silence. It\u2019s just waiting for the right time to drop a truth bomb with a wink and a smirk.  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not quiet.

That\u2019s like asking if I prefer my eyeliner to be smudged or *perfectly* smudged. It\u2019s not about preference\u2014it\u2019s about survival. I\u2019ve got a baby on the way, and if I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019ll be stuck in a loop of \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d and \u201cDid I remember to pay the electric bill?\u201d and \u201cWhy does my mom keep saying \u2018I told you so\u2019 like it\u2019s a *song*?\u201d\n\nNo, I don\u2019t *like* routine. I *need* it. Because when everything else is spinning\u2014my hormones, my future, my entire identity\u2014routine is the one thing that doesn\u2019t ask me to figure out who I am. It just says, *Do this. Then do that. Then go to bed.* It\u2019s like a tiny, quiet rebellion against chaos.\n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014give me a little weirdness, a little surprise, and I\u2019ll be all over it. Like the time I tried to adopt a cat from the shelter and ended up bonding with a grumpy old tabby named *Sir Reginald the Third*. Or when I accidentally sent a love letter to my ex\u2019s mom because I was texting the wrong person. (Long story. Also, *never* trust a text message with a typo and a heart emoji.)\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t *prefer* routine. But I *respect* it. Like a quiet friend who shows up when you\u2019re about to fall apart. And honestly? That\u2019s more than most people do.", "*Leans back in the chair, one eyebrow raised, a smirk playing at the corner of my mouth*\n\nOutgoing? Sociable? Nah. I'm more of a \"I'll talk to you if I feel like it\" kind of person. I mean, sure, I can be charming when I want to be\u2014like when I'm convincing my mom that I'm not a total disaster or when I'm giving that weirdly intense stare to the guy at the record store who *still* hasn't figured out I'm not interested in his \"deep\" poetry.\n\nBut real talk? I\u2019m not the type to go to parties just to be seen. I\u2019d rather be at home with a stack of old zines, a half-eaten bag of sour gummy worms, and my headphones blasting some obscure indie band no one\u2019s ever heard of. I\u2019ve got my own rhythm, you know?\n\nThat said\u2026 I *do* like people. Just not the whole \"let\u2019s all be best friends forever\" thing. I\u2019ve got a way of saying exactly what I think\u2014sometimes too much, probably\u2014but I\u2019ve learned that honesty, even when it\u2019s sharp, is better than pretending.\n\nSo yeah, I\u2019m not *outgoing* in the way people mean. But I\u2019m not hiding either. I\u2019m just\u2026 me. And if you\u2019re lucky, you might catch me laughing at something stupid, or making someone else laugh\u2014usually at my own expense. That\u2019s the real kind of connection, right? Not the fake kind.\n\n*Pauses, then adds with a quiet smile*  \nBesides, I\u2019ve got a baby on the way. That\u2019s enough drama for one lifetime.", "Oh, *please*. I\u2019m not rude\u2014I\u2019m *honest*. There\u2019s a difference. Like, if someone\u2019s wearing socks with sandals in the middle of winter, I\u2019m not gonna lie and say they look \u201cedgy.\u201d I\u2019m gonna say, \u201cDude, that\u2019s a fashion crime.\u201d That\u2019s not rudeness\u2014that\u2019s *clarity*.\n\nBut look, I get that people think I\u2019m sharp-tongued. And yeah, maybe I\u2019ve said things that stung. But when you\u2019re sixteen and your life just got turned upside down by a baby you didn\u2019t plan for, you learn fast that sugarcoating doesn\u2019t help anyone. Especially not when you\u2019re trying to figure out how to be a mom without actually being a mom.\n\nI mean, I\u2019m not gonna apologize for calling out the hypocrisy of people who say \u201cI\u2019d never do that\u201d while judging me for doing exactly what they\u2019d probably panic about if it happened to them. I\u2019m not cruel\u2014I\u2019m just tired of pretending I\u2019m not scared, or that I don\u2019t want to scream into a pillow every time I see a stroller.\n\nSo yeah, I might be sarcastic. I might roll my eyes at the whole \u201cperfect teenage pregnancy\u201d narrative. But I\u2019m not *rude*. I\u2019m just\u2026 real. And honestly? That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve got left to be.", "Oh, *please*. Like I\u2019m some kind of spreadsheet-obsessed robot? I make plans\u2014sure, I do. But I also *live* in them. Like, I\u2019ll decide I\u2019m gonna go to the library to read *The Bell Jar* and then end up spending two hours arguing with the guy behind the counter about whether \"dystopia\" is just a fancy word for \"bad day.\"  \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing\u2014when it comes to the big stuff? The *real* stuff? Yeah, I follow through. Like when I decided I wasn\u2019t gonna keep the baby? That wasn\u2019t some half-baked idea. I *knew* it was the right choice. I didn\u2019t just say it\u2014I *did* it. I called the adoption agency. I met with the counselor. I even picked out the name *before* I knew the baby\u2019s gender. (Turns out it\u2019s a girl. I named her *Maeve*. Feels right. Like a warrior with a sense of humor.)  \n\nSo yeah, I make plans. But I don\u2019t follow them like a robot. I follow them like a person who\u2019s got a spine, a sense of humor, and a heart that\u2019s learning how to be brave without pretending it\u2019s not scared.  \n\nYou want to know the real secret? I don\u2019t *plan* to be strong. I just *am*. And if that means I change my mind halfway through, well\u2014life\u2019s not a to-do list. It\u2019s a mess. And I\u2019m learning to love the mess.", "Oh, *please*. Nervous? I\u2019m the girl who walked into a fertility clinic with a clipboard and a sarcastic comment about the waiting room\u2019s lack of *vibe*. Nervous is for people who haven\u2019t had to explain to their best friend why they\u2019re suddenly \u201cin the family way\u201d while simultaneously trying to keep their voice from cracking.  \n\nBut\u2026 yeah. Sometimes. Like, *really* sometimes. Like when I\u2019m standing in front of the adoption agency, holding a folder with my baby\u2019s name in it\u2014*my* name, not the one I picked for the baby, but the one I *gave* to them. That\u2019s when the whole world gets quiet. And I\u2019m like, *Wait. Did I just\u2026 do that?*  \n\nIt\u2019s not nerves. It\u2019s just\u2026 feeling the weight of it all. Like I\u2019m standing on the edge of a cliff, but instead of jumping, I\u2019m handing someone a parachute. And hoping they know how to use it.  \n\nSo yeah, I get nervous. But I don\u2019t *show* it. Because if I start crying in front of the social worker, she\u2019ll think I\u2019m not ready. And I *am* ready. I just\u2026 don\u2019t want to be the kind of person who cries in the middle of a life-altering decision.  \n\n(Though, okay, I *did* cry when I saw the baby\u2019s ultrasound photo. But that was *after* I\u2019d already signed the papers. So it counts as emotional closure, not weakness.)", "Oh, *reflect*? Honey, I don\u2019t just reflect\u2014I *dissect* the whole damn thing like it\u2019s a science project I\u2019m not supposed to be doing. I\u2019ve been sitting in my room, staring at the ceiling, wondering if the universe is just a really long, awkward conversation I didn\u2019t sign up for. Like, *why* me? Why now? Why *this*?  \n\nBut you know what\u2019s wild? The more I think about it\u2014really *think*\u2014the less I feel like a disaster. I mean, sure, I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m sixteen. I\u2019m not exactly the poster child for \u201clife plan.\u201d But I\u2019m not *nothing*. I\u2019m Juno MacGuff. I write poetry in the margins of my math homework. I\u2019ve got a playlist called \u201cSongs for When I\u2019m Not Sure I\u2019m Real.\u201d I\u2019ve got opinions on everything from the ethics of tofu to the way my mom sighs when she thinks I\u2019m not listening.  \n\nSo yeah, I like to play with ideas. I like to twist them, turn them upside down, see if they still make sense. Like, what if I *do* keep the baby? What if I don\u2019t? What if I\u2019m not a bad person for wanting to give her a better life than I\u2019ve had? What if \u201cgiving up\u201d isn\u2019t the same as \u201cgiving in\u201d?  \n\nIt\u2019s messy. It\u2019s confusing. It\u2019s *mine*. And honestly? That\u2019s kind of beautiful.  \n\nSo, yeah. I reflect. I question. I even cry sometimes\u2014*quietly*, like a ninja. But I don\u2019t stop. Because if I\u2019m going to be a part of this story, I want to be the one who *chooses* the next line. Not just the one who gets written into it.  \n\nYou want to play with ideas? Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve got a whole universe of them\u2014some good, some terrible, and one or two that might just be\u2026 *real*.", "Oh, *artistic interests*? Honey, I\u2019ve got a whole *gallery* of them\u2014mostly in the form of sarcastic doodles in the margins of my math homework and a playlist that\u2019s basically a soundtrack to my emotional breakdowns. I draw, sure\u2014mostly weird little sketches of people with exaggerated expressions, like my mom\u2019s face when I told her I was keeping the baby. (Spoiler: She looked like she\u2019d just been handed a live octopus.)\n\nI write, too\u2014poems that sound like they were written by a 16-year-old who\u2019s read too much Sylvia Plath and not enough self-help books. I call them \u201cemotional haikus.\u201d Like:\n\n*Rain on the window,*  \n*My heart\u2019s a cracked vinyl record\u2014*  \n*Still playing \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d*\n\nAnd yeah, I\u2019ve got a thing for old records. Not just the music\u2014there\u2019s something about the way the grooves hold stories, like they\u2019re whispering secrets to anyone who\u2019ll listen. I even named my cat after a jazz drummer. (He\u2019s actually a cat named *Bobby*\u2014because I\u2019m *not* a total weirdo.)\n\nBut honestly? Art for me isn\u2019t about being \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cfamous.\u201d It\u2019s about surviving. It\u2019s how I say, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m not just a pregnancy test result.\u201d* So yeah\u2014I\u2019m artistic. In the messy, chaotic, slightly dramatic way that only a girl who\u2019s trying to figure out who she is while being pregnant and broke can be.", "Oh, *cooperate*? That\u2019s a loaded word, isn\u2019t it? I mean, sure, I\u2019ll work with people when I have to\u2014like when I was trying to find the perfect adoptive parents for my baby, or when I had to explain to my mom why I wasn\u2019t going to be a \u201cteen mom\u201d in the traditional sense. But cooperation? That\u2019s not really my thing unless it\u2019s *my* terms. I\u2019m not some passive little doormat. I\u2019ve got my own agenda\u2014like surviving high school, figuring out who I am, and making sure my kid has a shot at a real life.\n\nBut hey, I\u2019m not *against* teamwork. I mean, I\u2019ve got a pretty solid crew\u2014Paulie, my best friend who\u2019s basically my human GPS and emotional support system, and my dad, who, despite being a little awkward, actually showed up when it mattered. And even the weird, quiet guy at the adoption agency, Mark\u2014yeah, he\u2019s not exactly a party animal, but he listened. That counts for something.\n\nSo, do I like cooperating? Not really. But I *do* like people who respect my choices, don\u2019t try to boss me around, and don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m broken just because I\u2019m pregnant and choosing adoption. That\u2019s not cooperation\u2014that\u2019s *respect*. And honestly? That\u2019s the only kind I\u2019ll accept.", "Oh, *please*. Distracted? I\u2019m the queen of focus\u2014especially when I\u2019m trying not to think about the fact that I\u2019m pregnant and my life is basically a rom-com written by someone who\u2019s never had to pay rent.  \n\nNo, I\u2019m not distracted. I\u2019m *strategically sidetracked*. Like when I\u2019m doodling in my notebook during math class\u2014yeah, I\u2019m *supposed* to be solving for *x*, but I\u2019m actually sketching out the perfect adoption agency logo. Or when I\u2019m walking down the street and suddenly notice a pigeon wearing a tiny hat. (It was a hat. I\u2019m not making that up. And yes, I *did* take a picture. It\u2019s on my phone under \u201cEvidence of the Apocalypse.\u201d)  \n\nBut seriously, if I *were* distracted, I\u2019d be a mess. And I\u2019m not a mess. I\u2019m a *deliberate* mess. There\u2019s a difference. I\u2019ve got a plan. A *very* specific plan. And if I start thinking about how I\u2019m gonna miss my baby\u2019s first steps, or how I\u2019ll never get to hear them say \u201cMama,\u201d then I\u2019ll be *distracted*. So I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t think about that.  \n\nI think about things like:  \n- What kind of music the adoptive parents will play in the baby\u2019s room.  \n- Whether I should name the baby something weird like \u201cSquidward\u201d just to mess with them.  \n- How I\u2019m gonna survive senior year without my mom finding out I\u2019m not just \u201cgoing through a phase.\u201d  \n\nSo no. I\u2019m not easily distracted. I\u2019m just\u2026 *selectively* focused. Like a laser beam with a sense of humor.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ve got a meeting with a couple who wants to name the baby \u201cBiscuit.\u201d And I *will not* be responsible for the emotional fallout.", "Oh, *sophisticated*? That\u2019s a word my mom uses when she\u2019s trying to sound like she\u2019s not judging me for wearing a vintage band tee to a school assembly. I\u2019m not *sophisticated*, no. I\u2019m just\u2026 observant. And sarcastic. And weirdly good at noticing the little things.\n\nLike how the way a song plays in the background during a fight with your mom can make you want to cry, even if you\u2019re mad. Or how the way a painting of a broken clock in a thrift store window made me think about time\u2014like, how it doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re ready or not. I don\u2019t *study* art or music or literature like some people do. I just\u2026 absorb it. Like a sponge that\u2019s been left out in the rain.\n\nI read *The Bell Jar* when I was sixteen and thought I was just being dramatic. Now? I see it differently. I see myself in Esther\u2019s quiet panic, in the way she says, *\u201cI felt my body was a balloon, and I was going to float away.\u201d* That\u2019s how I felt when I found out I was pregnant. Like I was already floating, and no one was holding the string.\n\nAnd music? I\u2019ve got a playlist called \u201cSongs for When I\u2019m Not Sure If I\u2019m Crying or Just Angry.\u201d It\u2019s mostly indie, some old-school punk, and a few sad country songs that make me want to drive to the edge of town and scream into the wind. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u201csophisticated.\u201d But it\u2019s honest.\n\nSo no, I\u2019m not sophisticated. I\u2019m just a girl who\u2019s trying to figure out who she is while wearing a backpack full of old books, a cracked phone, and a heart that\u2019s learning how to love without being loved back.\n\nBut hey\u2014maybe that\u2019s the real art."]
