Land tax is often based on land value, not buildings, and is sometimes imposed differently (e.g., on land area, not rental value). This fits the contrast.  \n\n**3.** **assessment criteria**  \n\u2192 The blank refers to what is specified by the state and delegated to local bodies \u2014 clearly, it\u2019s about *how* properties are assessed \u2014 so *assessment criteria* fits perfectly.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n\n**Property tax** refers to a tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from **land tax**. The tax power is vested in states and delegated to local bodies, specifying **assessment criteria**, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Central government properties are exempt from this tax but they have to pay 'service charge'. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why This Works:  \n- **Property tax** is the correct term for the tax on buildings and land.  \n- **Land tax** contrasts well \u2014 it\u2019s a different type of tax, often based on land area, not buildings.  \n- **Assessment criteria** is the logical term for what local bodies are given to specify \u2014 how properties are evaluated.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are not alone.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are loved.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And somewhere, in a quiet office, a tax form is just being filled out \u2014 and saying, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\n\u2014 **Michael Scott**, *Tax Enthusiast & Emotional Storyteller* \ud83d\udcc4\u2764\ufe0f  \n\nP.S.
