This includes the two triangular bases and the three rectangular lateral faces.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst, we need to calculate the area of each triangular base. Since the base is nine meters long, we need to know the height of the triangle to calculate its area. However, the problem only provides the length of the base. Assuming the triangle is an equilateral triangle, the height would be (9 * sqrt(3)) / 2, approximately 7.70 meters. If the triangle is a right triangle, we\u2019d need the other leg length. Let\u2019s proceed assuming it\u2019s an equilateral triangle for simplicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cArea of one triangular base = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 7.70 = 34.65 square meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince there are two identical triangular bases, their combined area is 2 * 34.65 = 69.30 square meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext, we need to calculate the area of the three rectangular lateral faces. Each face has a width equal to the perpendicular height of the prism, which is twelve meters. The length of each rectangular face is the length of one side of the triangular base, which is nine meters. Therefore, the area of each rectangular face is 9 * 12 = 108 square meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince there are three rectangular faces, their combined area is 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, we add the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular faces to find the total surface area: 69.30 + 324 = 393.30 square meters.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 393.3 square meters.\u201d", "(The rain has ceased, leaving a chilling stillness in the air.

This perpendicular line will bisect the angle formed by the two original lines.\u201d\n\n(My gaze becomes distant, lost in a memory.)\n\n\u201cThe equation of this bisecting line will be y = -x + c, where \u2018c\u2019 is a constant. To minimize the maximum distance, \u2018c\u2019 must be chosen such that the bisecting line passes through the midpoint of the segment connecting the two original lines.\u201d\n\n(I turn back to you, my expression unreadable.)\n\n\u201cThe midpoint of the segment connecting (1, 1) and (5, 5) is ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3).
