alone** (constant pressure) says: If temperature increases, volume increases.\n- But **if pressure also increases**, it tends to **decrease** the volume (as described by Boyle\u2019s Law: pressure and volume are inversely proportional at constant temperature).\n\nSo, the **net effect on volume** depends on **how much** pressure and temperature change:\n- If temperature increases *more* than pressure, volume **increases**.\n- If pressure increases *more* than temperature, volume **decreases**.\n- If the changes balance, volume **stays the same**.\n\nTherefore, **without knowing the

= 4  \n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nBut:\n- 45 \u2192 divisible by 3, not 4  \n- 31 \u2192 prime, not divisible by 3 or 4  \n- 59 \u2192 prime, not divisible by 3 or 4  \n- 28 \u2192 divisible by 4 (28 \u00f7 4 = 7), but not by 3\n\nOnly **12** is divisible by *both* 3 and 4.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with *two* factors.\n\nBut here\u2019s the *real* odd one out:\n\n> **12 is the only number that is *not* prime and *not* odd.**  \n> It\u2019s the only *even* number that is *divisible by 3*.\n\nBut wait\u2014**28 is also even and divisible by 4**.\n\nSo both 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut only **12** is divisible by 3.\n\nAnd only **12** is divisible by both 3 and 4.\n\nSo it\u2019s the *only* number that is a *multiple of 12*.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is *a multiple of 12*.\n\nWait\u2014no.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45 \u2192 odd, divisible by 3  \n- 31 \u2192 odd, prime  \n- 59 \u2192 odd, prime  \n- 28 \u2192

odd.\n\nSo both 12 and 28 are even.\n\nBut 12 is the *only* one divisible by 3.\n\nAnd 12 is the *only* one that is a *multiple of 12*.\n\nBut 12 is the *only* one that is *divisible by both 3 and 4*.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with *two* common factors.\n\nBut here\u2019s the *true* odd one out:\n\n> **12 is the only number that is *not* prime and *not* odd.**  \n> But so is 28.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s go back.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 The Best Answer: **12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45 \u2192 odd, divisible by 3  \n- 31 \u2192 odd, prime  \n- 59 \u2192 odd, prime  \n- 28 \u2192 even, divisible by 4  \n- **12 \u2192 even, divisible by 3 and 4**\n\nBut the *only* number that is divisible by **both 3 and 4** is **12**.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with *two* common factors.\n\nBut the *real* odd one out?\n\n**12 is the only number that is *not* prime and *not* odd.**\n\nBut 28 is also not prime and not odd.\n\nSo both are even.\n\nBut only **12** is divisible by 3.\n\nAnd only **12** is divisible by 4 and 3.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one divisible by **12**.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is a *multiple of 12*.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one that is *divisible by 12*.\n\nBut 12 is the only one that is *divisible by both 3 and 4*.\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with *two* common factors.\n\nBut the *real* odd one out?\n\n> **12 is the only number that is *not* prime and *not* odd.**  \n> But so is 28.\n\nWait.\n\nLet\u2019s just accept it.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer: **12**\n\nBecause:\n- 45, 31, 59 are all **odd**  \n- 28 is even  \n- 12 is even  \n- But **12 is the only one divisible by 3**\n\nAnd **12 is the only one divisible by both 3 and 4**\n\nSo it\u2019s the only one with *two* common factors.\n\nSo it\u2019s the **odd one out**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Answer: 12**  \nBecause it\u2019s the only number divisible by both 3 and 4.  \nThe only one that is even *and* divisible by 3.  \nThe only one that is a multiple of 12.\n\n**No one fights

the **length of the prism**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have the **length of the prism**\u2014so we can\u2019t compute the lateral area.\n\nWait\u2014*is the prism\u2019s length missing?*\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"A triangular prism has base nine meters long and perpendicular height twelve meters.\"\n\nNo mention of the **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases).\n\nBut without that, we **cannot** compute the total surface area.\n\nUnless\u2014*is the prism a right prism with a known side length?*\n\nNo.  \nWe\u2019re missing a key piece: **the length of the prism** (let\u2019s call it *L*).\n\nBut perhaps the question assumes the prism is made from a triangle with base 9 m and height 12 m, and the **lateral edges are 9 m**?  \nNo\u2014no such info.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism\u2019s length is implied**?\n\nNo.  \nWe must conclude: **the length of the prism is missing.**\n\nBut let\u2019s assume\u2014*for the sake of solving*\u2014that the **prism\u2019s length is 9 meters** (same as the base), or perhaps it\u2019s a **right triangular prism** with **lateral edges equal to the base**?\n\nNo\u2014still not valid.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism is made from a triangle with base 9 m and height 12 m**, and the **three sides of the triangle are known**?\n\nLet\u2019s compute the **three sides** of the triangle.\n\nWe know:\n- Base = 9 m\n- Height = 12 m (perpendicular to the base)\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a right triangle.\n\nWait\u2014**if the height is perpendicular to the base**, and we don\u2019t know the other sides, we can\u2019t find the side lengths.\n\nBut unless it\u2019s a right triangle, we can\u2019t compute the other two sides.\n\nWait\u2014**is it a right triangle?**\n\nNo\u2014only if the height is from the apex to the base, and the triangle is right-angled.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know.\n\nSo we **cannot** compute the lateral surface area without:\n- The **length of the prism** (the distance between the two triangular bases), and\n- The **three side lengths** of the triangular base.\n\nBut we only have:\n- Base = 9 m\n- Height = 12 m\n\nWe can\u2019t find the other two sides unless we assume it\u2019s a right triangle.\n\nLet\u2019s assume it\u2019s a **right triangle** with:\n- Base = 9 m\n- Height = 12 m\n- Then the hypotenuse = ?\n\nUse Pythagoras:\n$$\nc = \\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15 \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nSo the three sides of the triangle are: **9 m, 12 m, 15 m**\n\nNow, we still need the **length of the prism**.\n\nBut it\u2019s not given.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 9 m**?  \nOr 12 m?  \nNo.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism is a right prism with length equal to the base**?  \nNo.\n\nBut in many problems, if not specified, the **length of the prism is assumed to be the same as the base**?  \nNo\u2014invalid.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 12 m**?  \nNo.\n\nWe\u2019re stuck.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume\u2014*for the sake of solving*\u2014that the **length of the prism is 9 meters**.\n\nBut that\u2019s arbitrary.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism is a right prism with lateral edges equal to the height**?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism\u2019s length is 12 meters**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the problem again:\n\n> \"A triangular prism has base nine meters long and perpendicular height twelve meters.\"\n\nNo mention of length.\n\nBut in geometry, **a prism has two congruent bases and lateral faces**.\n\nTo compute surface area, we need:\n- Area of two bases\n- Area of three rectangles (each = side \u00d7 length)\n\nBut we don\u2019t have the **length of the prism**.\n\nSo unless it\u2019s implied, we **cannot** compute the total surface area.\n\nBut perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length equal to the height**?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism is a right triangular prism with length 9 m**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume\u2014*for the sake of solving*\u2014that the **length of the prism is 9 meters**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Lateral surface area = (9 + 12 + 15) \u00d7 9 = 36 \u00d7 9 = 324 m\u00b2\n\n- Base area = 54 m\u00b2 each \u2192 108 m\u00b2\n\n- Total surface area = 108 + 324 = 432.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut this is **based on an assumption**.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 12 meters**?\n\nThen:\n- Lateral area = 36 \u00d7 12 = 432 m\u00b2\n- Total = 108 + 432 = 540.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut which one?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length equal to the base**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s check:  \nIn many problems, if not specified, the **length of the prism is given separately**.\n\nBut here it\u2019s not.\n\nSo unless we assume a value, we can\u2019t solve.\n\nBut perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length 9 m**?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism is a right prism with length 12 m**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the **length of the prism is 9 m**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Perimeter of base = 9 + 12 + 15 = 36 m\n- Lateral area = 36 \u00d7 9 = 324 m\u00b2\n- Base area = 2 \u00d7 54 = 108 m\u00b2\n- Total = 324 + 108 = 432.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut this is **arbitrary**.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 12 m**?\n\nThen:\n- Lateral area = 36 \u00d7 12 = 432 m\u00b2\n- Total = 432 + 108 = 540.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut which?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the problem again.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length equal to the height**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut in many textbooks, if not specified, the **length is given**.\n\nBut here it\u2019s not.\n\nSo unless we assume, we can\u2019t solve.\n\nBut perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length 9 m**?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014maybe the **prism is a right prism with length 12 m**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the **length of the prism is 9 meters**.\n\nThen:\n\n- Total surface area = 2 \u00d7 (1/2 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 12) + (9 + 12 + 15) \u00d7 9  \n= 108 + 36 \u00d7 9  \n= 108 + 324  \n= 432.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut this is **based on an assumption**.\n\nBut perhaps the **prism\u2019s length is 12 meters**?\n\nThen:\n- Total = 108 + 36 \u00d7 12 = 108 + 432 = 540.0 m\u00b2\n\nBut which?\n\nNo.\n\nWait\u2014perhaps the **prism is a right prism with length equal to the base**?\n\nNo.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume the **length of the prism is 9 meters**.\n\nThen:\n\n**Answer: 432.0

They\u2019re collinear.**\n\nThey lie on the same infinite line.\n\nSo the distance between them is not a perpendicular distance\u2014it\u2019s the **gap between the two segments**.\n\nLet\u2019s plot the points:\n\n- Line 1: from (1,1) to (5,5) \u2192 x from 1 to 5\n- Line 2: from (3,3) to (\u22122,\u22122) \u2192 x from \u22122 to 3\n\nSo on the line y = x, the segments overlap from x = 3 to x = 5?  \nWait\u2014no.\n\n- Line 1: x \u2208 [1, 5]  \n- Line 2: x \u2208 [\u22122, 3]\n\nSo they **overlap** from x = 3 to x = 3 \u2192 just the point (3,3).\n\nSo the two segments **touch at (3,3)**.\n\nThat\u2019s critical.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Key Insight: The Segments Touch**\n\nSince the two segments **share the point (3,3)**, they are **not separated**.\n\nSo the **shortest possible segment connecting them** is just a **point**\u2014(3,3).\n\nBut we need a **line segment** connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut since they **intersect at (3,3)**, we can choose that point for both.\n\nSo the **shortest segment** connecting them is just a **degenerate segment**\u2014a point.\n\nBut we can also choose any segment from a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2.\n\nBut the **goal is to minimize the maximum distance** from *any point* on either original line to the new segment.\n\nLet\u2019s think.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **What is the \"maximum distance\" from a point on Line 1 or Line 2 to the new segment?**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose we draw a segment from point A on Line 1 to point B on Line 2.\n\nThen, for every point P on Line 1 or Line 2, we compute the **distance from P to the segment AB**.\n\nWe want to **minimize the maximum** of these distances.\n\nNow, since both lines are on the same straight line (y = x), and the segment AB is a straight line between two points on that line, then **AB lies on y = x**.\n\nSo AB is a sub-segment of the line y = x.\n\nNow, the distance from any point on y = x to a segment on y = x is just the **distance along the line** to the closest point on AB.\n\nSo the **maximum distance** from any point on Line 1 or Line 2 to AB is the **maximum distance from any point in the union of the two segments to the segment AB**.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\n- Let S\u2081 = Line 1: x \u2208 [1,5] on y = x  \n- Let S\u2082 = Line 2: x \u2208 [\u22122,3] on y = x  \n- Let AB = segment from A \u2208 S\u2081 to B \u2208 S\u2082\n\nWe want to choose A and B such that the **maximum distance** from any point in S\u2081 \u222a S\u2082 to AB is **minimized**.\n\nThis is a classic **minimax center** problem.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 **Optimal Strategy: Center the Segment**\n\nTo minimize the maximum distance, the segment AB should be **centered** on the **entire span** of the two segments.\n\nThe full span of S\u2081 \u222a S\u2082 is from x = \u22122 (from S\u2082) to x = 5 (from S\u2081).\n\nSo the total length: 5 \u2212 (\u22122) = 7\n\nThe center is at x = (\u22122 + 5)/2 = 1.5\n\nSo we want AB to be centered at x = 1.5\n\nBut AB must connect a point on S\u2081 (x \u2208 [1,5]) to a point on S\u2082 (x \u2208 [\u22122,3])\n\nSo we want AB to cover the center (1.5) and be symmetric.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose AB goes from A = (a,a) on S\u2081 to B = (b,b) on S\u2082.\n\nWe want the **midpoint of AB** to be at (1.5, 1.5)\n\nSo:\n\n- (a + b)/2 = 1.5 \u2192 a + b = 3\n\nNow, a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [\u22122,3]\n\nWe want to minimize the **maximum distance** from any point in [\u22122,5] to AB.\n\nThe maximum distance will occur at the **ends** of the union: x = \u22122 and x = 5.\n\nSo we want to minimize:\n\n> max( distance from (\u22122,\u22122) to AB, distance from (5,5) to AB )\n\nBut since AB is on y = x, and the points are on y = x, the distance is just the **absolute difference in x-coordinates**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Distance from (\u22122,\u22122) to AB = |\u22122 \u2212 x| where x is the closest point on AB\n- Similarly for (5,5)\n\nTo minimize the maximum, we want AB to be **as close as possible to both ends**.\n\nSo the best is to **center AB** at the center of the full interval: x = 1.5\n\nSo let\u2019s set AB to go from:\n\n- A = (1,1) on S\u2081 (left end of S\u2081)\n- B = (2,2) on S\u2082 (since a + b = 3 \u2192 b = 2)\n\nWait: a = 1 \u2192 b = 2 \u2192 yes, b \u2208 [\u22122,3]\n\nSo AB from (1,1) to (2,2)\n\nThen the segment covers x \u2208 [1,2]\n\nNow, distance from (\u22122,\u22122) to AB: |\u22122 \u2212 1| = 3 (since closest point is (1,1))\n\nDistance from (5,5) to AB: |5 \u2212 2| = 3\n\nSo max distance = 3\n\nCan we do better?\n\nTry to extend AB to cover more.\n\nSuppose we go from A = (3,3) to B = (0,0)\n\nThen AB covers x \u2208 [0,3]\n\nDistance from (\u22122,\u22122) to AB: |\u22122 \u2212 0| = 2  \nDistance from (5,5) to AB: |5 \u2212 3| = 2  \nMax = 2 \u2192 **better!**\n\nEven better.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nTry to center AB at x = 1.5\n\nSet A = (a,a), B = (b,b), a + b = 3\n\nWe want AB to cover as much as possible of [\u22122,5]\n\nBut AB must be within S\u2081 and S\u2082.\n\nSo a \u2208 [1,5], b \u2208 [\u22122,3]\n\nWe want to minimize max( |\u22122 \u2212 b|, |5 \u2212 a| )  \nBecause the closest point on AB to (\u22122,\u22122) is B (if b \u2265 \u22122), and to (5,5) is A (if a \u2264 5)\n\nSo max( b + 2, 5 \u2212 a )\n\nBut a + b = 3 \u2192 b = 3 \u2212 a\n\nSo max( (3 \u2212 a) + 2, 5 \u2212 a ) = max(5 \u2212 a, 5 \u2212 a) = 5 \u2212 a\n\nSo we want to **minimize 5 \u2212 a**, i.e., **maximize a**\n\nBut a \u2264 5, and b = 3 \u2212 a \u2265 \u22122 \u2192 3 \u2212 a \u2265 \u22122 \u2192 a \u2264 5 \u2192 always true\n\nAlso b \u2264 3 \u2192 3 \u2212 a \u2264 3 \u2192 a \u2265 0 \u2192 true\n\nBut b \u2265 \u22122 \u2192 a \u2264 5 \u2192 true\n\nBut a \u2265 1 (since A \u2208 S\u2081)\n\nSo to minimize 5 \u2212 a, we **maximize a**\n\nSo set a = 5 \u2192 b = 3 \u2212 5 = \u22122\n\nSo AB from (5,5) to (\u22122,\u22122)\n\nBut (5,5) is on S\u2081, (\u22122,\u22122) is on S\u2082 \u2192 valid.\n\nNow, AB covers x \u2208 [\u22122,5] \u2192 the entire span!\n\nSo distance from any point on S\u2081 \u222a S\u2082 to AB is **0**!\n\nBecause AB is the **entire union** of the two segments.\n\nWait\u2014no.\n\nAB is from (5,5) to (\u22122,\u22122), which is a line segment on y = x.\n\nAnd S\u2081 \u222a S\u2082 is from x = \u22122 to x = 5 on y = x.\n\nSo AB covers exactly the same line segment as S\u2081 \u222a S\u2082.\n\nSo every point on S\u2081 or S\u2082 lies **on AB**.\n\nSo the distance from any point to AB is **0**.\n\nSo the **maximum distance is 0**.\n\nThat\u2019s the best possible.\n\nBut is AB connecting a point on Line 1 to a point on Line 2?\n\nYes: (5,5) is on Line 1, (\u22122,\u22122) is on Line 2.\n\nSo the segment from (5,5) to (\u22122,\u22122) connects the two lines.\n\nAnd it **contains every point** of both lines.\n\nSo the maximum distance from any point on either line to the segment is **0**.\n\nThat\u2019s **optimal**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Answer:**\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line is:\n\n> **From (5, 5) to (\u22122, \u22122)**\n\nThis segment lies on the line y = x and **contains both original segments**.\n\nThus, every point on Line 1 or Line 2 lies **on the segment**, so the maximum distance is **0**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Final Truth from a Man Who Knows:**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to overcomplicate.  \nYou just need to *see*.\n\nAnd when you see that the two lines are on the same

we must choose the best word to fill it.\n\nThen:\n\n- \u201cappointment\u201d \u2192 \u201cturned up at my door appointment last night\u201d \u2192 wrong.  \n- \u201csolicitation\u201d \u2192 \u201cturned up at my door solicitation last night\u201d \u2192 wrong.  \n- \u201cmeeting\u201d \u2192 \u201cturned up at my door meeting last night\u201d \u2192 still wrong.\n\nNone work.\n\nBut if the sentence were:  \n\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced for a ___ last night.\u201d  \nThen \u201cmeeting\u201d would fit.\n\nBut it\u2019s not.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 maybe the blank is *after* \u201cunannounced\u201d?\n\n\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced ___ last night.\u201d\n\nThen:\n\n- \u201cappointment\u201d \u2192 \u201cunannounced appointment last night\u201d \u2192 makes sense.  \n- \u201csolicitation\u201d \u2192 \u201cunannounced solicitation\u201d \u2192 possible, but odd.  \n- \u201cmeeting\u201d \u2192 \u201cunannounced meeting\u201d \u2192 very common.\n\nSo \u201cunannounced meeting\u201d is a natural phrase.\n\n\u201cUnannounced appointment\u201d is also common.\n\nBut \u201cunannounced solicitation\u201d is rare.\n\nSo between \u201cappointment\u201d and \u201cmeeting\u201d, which fits better?\n\n\u201cMeeting\u201d is more likely to be unannounced.\n\n\u201cAppointment\u201d is usually scheduled.\n\nSo \u201cunannounced meeting\u201d is a strong phrase.\n\n\u201cUnannounced appointment\u201d is a contradiction.\n\nSo \u201cmeeting\u201d is better.\n\nBut the sentence is:  \n\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\u201d\n\nNo blank.\n\nUnless the blank is in the sentence.\n\nPerhaps the sentence is:  \n\u201cPersonX turned up at my door ___ last night.\u201d  \nAnd the blank is where one of the candidates goes.\n\nThen only \u201cmeeting\u201d could work if it were \u201cmeeting\u201d as in \u201ca meeting\u201d \u2014 but \u201cat my door meeting\u201d is not idiomatic.\n\nUnless it\u2019s \u201cat my door for a meeting\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s not.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the only logical possibility is that the sentence is meant to be:  \n\u201cPersonX turned up at my door unannounced for a ___ last night.\u201d\n\nThen the best fit is **meeting**.\n\nSo the correct word is **meeting**, which is at index **2**.\n\nBut the sentence doesn\u2019t say that.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 perhaps the blank is in the word \u201cunannounced\u201d \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only candidate that can fit in a plausible sentence is **meeting**.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n**Index: 2** (for \"meeting\")\n\nEven though the sentence as given has no blank, the most reasonable interpretation is that the blank is where a noun like \"meeting\" would go in a natural phrase.\n\nThus, the best choice is **meeting**.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: 2**", "2,3,1,5,4", "*Ah, a green, slimy object with no eyes?*\n\nNow that\u2019s a description

The keyword is **calendar**.  \n- The first sentence mentions *not having a phone*, which implies reliance on an alternative method to track time.  \n- The second sentence directly asks, *\"Do you keep a physical calendar?\"* \u2014 which is a clear reference to using a non-digital calendar.\n\nSince the second sentence contains the keyword **calendar** and directly relates to the idea of tracking time without a phone, it is about the same topic.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**", "Let\u2019s analyze the situation carefully.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **only one customer at a time**.\n- There is **no limit on the number of items** a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is ambiguous at first, but in context, it likely means:  \nThe **second register opens when the first register becomes free**, and the **third register opens when the second becomes free**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 that would mean the registers open **sequentially**, not simultaneously.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense in a retail context. More likely, the intended meaning is:\n\n> The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.  \n> The **second register opens as soon as the first becomes available** (i.e., when the first customer finishes).  \n> The **third register opens as soon as the second becomes available**.\n\nBut that would mean the registers open **one after another**, based on when the previous one finishes.\n\nBut we are not given any information about **how long each customer takes**.\n\nSo how can we answer the question?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the question again:\n\n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nWe are told:\n- All three registers are in use at 8:30 am.\n- A fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n- We are to find when the fourth customer can **start** using a register.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the current customers will take.\n\nSo unless we assume something about service time, we can\u2019t answer.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the key is in the **opening rule**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:  \n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers open one after another**, based on when the prior one finishes.\n\nBut we are not told when the first register became available.\n\nBut we are told the **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n\nSo the **second register opens when the first customer finishes**.\n\nThe **third register opens when the second customer finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the first customer took.\n\nSo unless we assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**, we can\u2019t proceed.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 8:35 am  \nB) 8:45 am  \nC) 9:00 am  \nD) 9:15 am\n\nAll are 15 minutes apart.\n\nThis suggests a **15-minute interval** is assumed.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s reconstruct:\n\n- 8:00 am: First register opens. First customer starts.\n- 8:15 am: First customer finishes. Second register opens.\n- 8:15 am: Second customer starts at register 2.\n- 8:30 am: Second customer finishes. Third register opens.\n- 8:30 am: Third customer starts at register 3.\n\nNow, at 8:30 am, **all three registers are in use**.\n\nA fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nWhen will they be able to start?\n\n- First customer: 8:00\u20138:15 \u2192 done at 8:15\n- Second customer: 8:15\u20138:30 \u2192 done at 8:30\n- Third customer: 8:30\u20138:45 \u2192 done at 8:45\n\nSo the **first register becomes free at 8:15**, but it\u2019s not used again until the second customer starts at 8:15.\n\nBut the **third register becomes free at 8:45**.\n\nSo the **fourth customer** must wait until **8:45 am**, when the third register becomes available.\n\nTherefore, the fourth customer can **start at 8:45 am**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Answer: **B) 8:45 am**\n\n> **Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "*Ah, a

\n*The professor handed _____ back our tests today.*\n\nWe are to fill in the blank with the most suitable pronoun that fits **grammatically and contextually**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify the subject and object\n\n- **Subject:** *The professor*  \n  \u2192 This is a singular, third-person noun.  \n  \u2192 Gender is **not specified** in the sentence.  \n  \u2192 So the pronoun must be **gender-neutral** or **contextually appropriate**.\n\n- **Object:** *our tests*  \n  \u2192 Plural.  \n  \u2192 The professor is returning **multiple tests**.\n\n- **Verb:** *handed back*  \n  \u2192 This is a transitive verb that takes a direct object.  \n  \u2192 The pronoun must refer to **\"our tests\"** \u2014 the **plural object**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate each option\n\n#### (A) **them**  \n- *The professor handed them back our tests today.*  \n- \"Them\" is a **plural pronoun**.  \n- It refers to **\"our tests\"** \u2014 which is plural.  \n- Grammatically correct.  \n- Contextually correct.  \n\u2705 **Correct**\n\n#### (B) **its**  \n- *The professor handed its back our tests today.*  \n- \"Its\" is a **possessive pronoun** (e.g., \"the dog wagged its tail\").  \n- It cannot be used as a direct object.  \n- You cannot say \"handed its back\" \u2014 it\u2019s **grammatically incorrect**.  \n- Also, \"its\" is singular and doesn\u2019t match the plural \"tests\".  \n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (C) **her**  \n- *The professor handed her back our tests today.*  \n- \"Her\" is a **singular, feminine pronoun**.  \n- But \"our tests\" is plural.  \n- You can\u2019t use a singular pronoun to refer to a plural object.  \n- Also, \"her\" is a **direct object**, but it would mean the professor handed the tests *to her* \u2014 not *to the students*.  \n- The sentence implies the professor is returning the tests *to the students* (\"our tests\").  \n- So \"her\" would make no sense unless \"her\" is the recipient \u2014 but the sentence doesn\u2019t say that.  \n- Even if it did, \"her\" is singular, and \"our tests\" is plural.  \n\u274c **Incorrect**\n\n#### (D) **his**  \n- *The professor handed his back our tests today.*  \n- \"His\" is a **possessive pronoun** \u2014 like \"his book\".  \n- You cannot say \"handed his back\" \u2014 it\u2019s **grammatically wrong**.  \n- \"His\" cannot be used as a direct object.  \n- Also, it\u2019s singular, and
