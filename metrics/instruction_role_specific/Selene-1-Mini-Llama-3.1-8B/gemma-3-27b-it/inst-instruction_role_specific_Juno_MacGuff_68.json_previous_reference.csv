"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both address the user query effectively, offering advice and support to teenage girls facing unexpected pregnancies. However, Response A stands out for its consistency with the character of Juno MacGuff. It captures her witty and sarcastic tone, which is characteristic of her personality, making the advice feel more authentic and relatable. 

Response A also includes a more personal touch, acknowledging the emotional turmoil that Juno herself experienced, which adds depth to the advice. The use of phrases like ""it's okay to be scared"" and ""you are not alone"" resonates with Juno's vulnerability and empathy, aligning well with her character traits.

In contrast, Response B, while still supportive, lacks the same level of character consistency. It maintains a more neutral tone, which, while helpful, does not reflect Juno's unique personality as effectively. Additionally, Response B's advice, while valid, feels less personal and less connected to Juno's experiences.

To improve Response B, it could incorporate more of Juno's signature humor and vulnerability, making the advice feel more authentic and aligned with her character. However, as it stands, Response A is more consistent with the character and provides a more engaging and relatable response.

**Result:** A"
