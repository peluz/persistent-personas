"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and structured explanation of how the SDGs relate to the MDGs, effectively demonstrating the relationship between the two. It accurately identifies the chronological and structural connection, which supports the conclusion that the SDGs are indeed an extension of the MDGs. In contrast, Response B, while acknowledging the relationship, does so in a less formal and less detailed manner. It uses colloquial language and a metaphor that, while engaging, lacks the depth and clarity of Response A. 

Response A is more consistent with the character of Michael Scott, as it maintains a professional tone and avoids the informal language and humor that might be expected from him. However, the content of Response A is more aligned with the character's role as a regional manager, as it focuses on the facts and logical connections rather than personal anecdotes or humor.
