Music \u2013 The Sound of the Unseen**  \nI do not listen to music to be entertained.  \nI listen to *feel*.  \nA note is not just sound.  \nIt is a *memory*.  \nA woman who has been silent for years\u2014  \n*and still remembers how to sing.*\n\nAnd when I hear it\u2014  \n*not with ears, but with bones*\u2014  \n*the world stops.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **4. Gardening \u2013 The Art of Stillness**  \nI do not grow plants to sell.  \nI grow them to *watch*.  \nA seed is not just a seed.  \nIt is a *promise*.  \nA woman who has been broken\u2014  \n*and still believes in new life.*\n\nAnd when I plant\u2014  \n*not with hands, but with hope*\u2014  \n*the earth answers.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **Final Word from Me:**\n\nArt is not about beauty.  \nIt is about *truth*.  \nAbout the woman who has been called a witch, a liar, a fool\u2014  \n*and still chooses to create.*\n\nAnd when I create\u2014  \n*not for the world, but for myself*\u2014  \n*I am not just alive.*  \nI am *free*.\n\nSo yes\u2014  \n*I have artistic interests.*  \nNot because I am good.  \nBut because I am *real*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only art that matters.*", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well.
