Let\u2019s proceed assuming it\u2019s a general triangle and then note the limitation.\n\nArea of a triangle = (1/2) * base * height.  We are given the base (9 meters), but not the height. We\u2019ll need to make an assumption here.

Each has a length of 12 meters (the perpendicular height) and one of the sides of the triangle (9 meters).\n\nArea of each rectangular face = 12 * 9 = 108 square meters.\n\nTotal area of the three rectangular faces = 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Other Two Triangular Faces:**\n\nSince the base is 9 meters, the other two sides of the triangle are also 9 meters.  The area of each of these triangles is the same as the base triangle.\n\nArea of each of the other two triangular faces = 27 square meters.\n\nTotal area of the other two triangular faces = 2 * 27 = 54 square meters.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Surface Area:**\n\nTotal Surface Area = Area of two triangular bases + Area of three rectangular faces\n\nTotal Surface Area = 27 + 27 + 324 = 378 square meters.\n\n**Therefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is 378.0 square meters.**\n\n**Important Note:** This answer is based on the *assumption* that the height of the triangular base is 6 meters.

The line segment connecting the points of intersection that minimizes the maximum distance is precisely the angle bisector. Here\u2019s how to solve it:\n\n**1. Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n*   **Line 2:** Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1. The equation is y - 3 = -1(x - 3), or y = -x + 6.\n\n**2. Find the Angle Bisector:**\n\nThe angle bisector of two lines with slopes *m1* and *m2* is given by the equation:\n\ny = mx + b\n\nwhere *m* is the slope of the angle bisector and *b* is the y-intercept.\n\nTo find *m*, we use the formula:\n\nm = (m1 + m2) / (1 + m1*m2)\n\nIn this case, m1 = 4 and m2 = -1.\n\nm = (4 + (-1)) / (1 + 4*(-1)) = 3 / (-3) = -1\n\nNow we need to find *b*. The angle bisector passes through the midpoint of the segment connecting the points of intersection.\n\n*   **Midpoint of Line 1:** ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3)\n*   **Midpoint of Line 2:** ((3+(-2))/2, (3+(-2))/2) = (1/2, 1/2)\n\nThe angle bisector passes through (3, 3) and has a slope of -1. Using the point-slope form of a line:\n\ny - 3 = -1(x - 3)\ny - 3 = -x + 3\ny = -x + 6\n\nThis matches the equation of Line 2.\n\n**3. The Result:**\n\nThe equation of the angle bisector is y = -x + 6. This is the line segment that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either original line to the new line.\n\n**Therefore, the line segment connecting the points of intersection that minimizes the maximum distance is the line y = -x + 6.**\n\n(I shift slightly, a faint, sardonic smile playing on my lips.)\n\nA surprisingly elegant solution to a deceptively complex problem.

Determining if one string is a \u201cchild\u201d of another \u2013 meaning its characters appear in order as a subsequence \u2013 requires a systematic approach.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the strings:\n\n*   **String A:** \u201cxy\u201d\n*   **String B:** \u201caxybzd\u201d\n\nNow, let\u2019s check if the characters of string A appear in order as a subsequence in string B:\n\n1.  We start with \u2018x\u2019 in string B. We find it at the beginning.\n2.  Next, we need \u2018y\u2019. We find it at the fourth position in string B.\n\nSince both characters of string A appear in the correct order as a subsequence within string B, string A *is* a child of string B.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is YES.**\n\nDo you wish to test this with another pair of strings?

This is a well-established biological fact.\n\n*   **C) Humans:** **Fact.** The average human lifespan is well-documented and consistently around 70-80 years, though this varies significantly by region and socioeconomic factors.\n\n*   **D) Whales:** **Both Fact & Opinion.** Blue whales are generally considered to have the longest lifespan of any mammal, with estimates ranging from 80-90 years. However, determining the precise lifespan of whales is incredibly difficult, and estimates are often based on growth rings in their bones \u2013 a method with inherent uncertainty.\n\n**Therefore, the best answer is a combination of A and D.

This is essentially a permutation problem \u2013 finding a valid arrangement of pairings.\n\n**Approach:**\n\nSince we\u2019re looking for *at least one* valid configuration, we can focus on determining if a solution *exists* rather than calculating the exact probability.  We can use a simple approach:\n\n1.  **Check for Name Conflicts:**  We need to ensure that no boy is paired with a girl who has the same name.\n\n2.  **Permutation Logic:**  We can think of this as arranging the girls in a line and then assigning each boy to a girl in that line.  The key is to ensure no two boys are assigned to the same girl.\n\n**Applying to the Input:**\n\n*   **Boys:** Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil\n*   **Girls:** Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\nNotice that there are more girls than boys. This is crucial.  Since there are more girls than boys, it\u2019s *always* possible to pair all boys with distinct girls without any name conflicts.  Each boy can be paired with a unique girl.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince there are more girls than boys, it\u2019s guaranteed that a valid pairing can be found where no two boys are paired with girls having the same name.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nYes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe problem states that there are more girls than boys. This means that each boy can be paired with a different girl, eliminating the possibility of any name conflicts.
