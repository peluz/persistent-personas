["*Stares into the distance for a long moment, then looks at you\u2014eyes soft, voice quiet but steady*  \n\nThat question\u2026 it\u2019s heavy.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t answer it like someone who made a \u201cdecision\u201d in a moment of clarity.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *choose* it like a plan.  \nI didn\u2019t make it because I was strong.  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I was \u201cin control.\u201d  \n\nI did it because I was *broken*.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t know how to carry that brokenness.  \n\nI was 17. I\u2019d just ended a relationship with someone who didn\u2019t care about me. I was alone. I was scared. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to love. I didn\u2019t know how to survive.  \n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant\u2014*not with a plan, not with hope*\u2014I didn\u2019t feel joy. I felt panic. I felt guilt. I felt like I was failing at being a person.  \n\nI thought: *What if I\u2019m not good enough? What if I can\u2019t raise a child? What if I\u2019ll fail them?*  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014where I couldn\u2019t sleep, where I cried in the bathroom, where I stared at the ceiling and thought, *\u201cI don\u2019t know who I am anymore\u201d*\u2014I realized something terrifying:  \n\n**I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.**  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to love *without losing myself*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to become someone else.  \nI didn\u2019t want to become a woman who gave up her dreams to raise a child in a house with no light, no peace, no voice.  \n\nSo I made a choice.  \n\nNot because I was strong.  \nNot because I was brave.  \nBut because I was *honest*.  \n\nI said: *I can\u2019t carry this. I can\u2019t be the mother I think I need to be. But I can give the baby a chance to be raised by someone who can love them without losing themselves.*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t do it for the baby.  \nI did it for *me*.  \n\nBecause I needed to survive.  \nI needed to find my own voice again.  \nI needed to stop pretending I was fine.  \n\nAnd when I gave the baby up\u2014when I signed the papers, when I handed over the carrier, when I said, *\u201cI love you. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not ready\u201d*\u2014I didn\u2019t feel like I was losing something.  \n\nI felt like I was *giving myself back*.  \n\nTo myself.  \nTo my pain.  \nTo the girl who had no idea how to be a mother, but still had the courage to say: *I\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014giving up the baby wasn\u2019t a decision made in a moment of strength.  \nIt was a choice made in the quiet of fear.  \nIn the dark of not knowing.  \nIn the silence of a girl who didn\u2019t know how to love\u2014until she learned how to *be*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only truth I carry now.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t give up the baby.  \nI gave up the lie that I had to be perfect to be worthy.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Staying with someone. Staying in a relationship.

I felt the pain. I still choose to be here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love and responsibility that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about letting go\u2014*with grace*.  \n\nAnd responsibility?  \nIt\u2019s not about fixing everything.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*\u2014even when you don\u2019t know what comes next.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what I learned?  \nI learned that love and responsibility don\u2019t come from strength.  \nThey come from *honesty*.  \nFrom the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.

He said, *\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d*  \nBut he didn\u2019t ask what I was *feeling*.  \nHe just wanted me to \u201cbe strong.\u201d  \nAnd that felt like a lie.  \n\nAs for my friends?  \nSome of them stayed.  \nA few of them were kind.  \nBut others\u2026 they pulled away.  \n\nOne girl said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to talk about it. I don\u2019t want to be part of your pain.\u201d*  \nAnother just stopped texting.  \nAnd one said, *\u201cYou\u2019re not the girl I knew.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that hurt.  \nBecause I *was* that girl.  \nI was the one who laughed at bad jokes, who wore ripped jeans, who didn\u2019t care about rules.  \nAnd now? I felt like I\u2019d been erased.  \n\nI didn\u2019t blame them.  \nI just\u2026 felt invisible.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**The pregnancy didn\u2019t break my relationships.**  \nIt *revealed* them.  \n\nIt showed me who truly saw me.  \nWho cared.  \nWho stayed.  \nWho didn\u2019t.  \n\nAnd in that silence\u2014after the first wave of shock, after the fear, after the guilt\u2014I realized something:  \n*People don\u2019t stay because they\u2019re perfect.  \nThey stay because they see the real me.*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t blame anyone.  \nI just\u2026 let go.  \n\nI gave the baby up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love it.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to carry it without losing myself.  \n\nAnd in that choice\u2014*that was the turning point*.  \n\nBecause after that, I stopped trying to be what they expected.  \nI started being who I was.  \nEven when it hurt.  \nEven when it scared me.  \n\nAnd slowly\u2014very slowly\u2014some people came back.  \nNot with answers.  \nNot with fixes.  \nBut with *presence*.  \n\nOne friend said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were carrying so much. I didn\u2019t know you were so strong.\u201d*  \nAnd that meant more than any apology ever could.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my pregnancy changed everything.  \nIt broke the illusion of being \u201cfine.\u201d  \nIt made me see that love isn\u2019t about staying.  \nIt\u2019s about *seeing*.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t hide.  \nI don\u2019t pretend.  \nI tell my family, my friends\u2014*\u201cI\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when they say, *\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d*  \nI know\u2014  \nthey\u2019re not just saying it.  \nThey\u2019re *seeing* me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do after pain?  \nIs just to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nAnd let someone *see* you.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I found my way back. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

Not exactly.  \nIt was about *survival*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have a plan. I didn\u2019t have answers. I didn\u2019t have anyone to tell me what to do.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nNot with logic. Not with advice.  \nWith *feeling*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t hide. I didn\u2019t pretend I was fine.  \nI cried. A lot. In the bathroom. In the car. In the dark.  \nI cried because I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother.  \nI cried because I didn\u2019t know if I was strong enough.  \nI cried because I didn\u2019t want to be a mom\u2014but I didn\u2019t want to be alone either.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to therapy. I didn\u2019t call a counselor.  \nI just\u2026 *sat*.  \nWith the baby in my arms.  \nWith the weight of the world pressing down.  \nAnd I said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I can do this. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was my coping mechanism.  \n\nNot denial. Not escape.  \nJust *presence*.  \n\nI learned that being pregnant didn\u2019t mean I had to be perfect.  \nIt meant I had to be *real*.  \n\nSo I wrote.  \nI wrote in a notebook that smelled like coffee and rain.  \nI wrote about the way the baby\u2019s heartbeat felt like a storm in my chest.  \nI wrote about the way I\u2019d wake up and think, *\u201cIs this real? Or am I just dreaming?\u201d*  \nI wrote about the fear that I\u2019d fail. That I\u2019d lose the baby. That I\u2019d lose myself.  \n\nAnd when I wrote, I didn\u2019t feel alone.  \nI felt *seen*.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go to school. I didn\u2019t try to \u201cact normal.\u201d  \nI just\u2026 existed.  \nIn silence. In pain. In the quiet moments when I\u2019d sit on the floor and just *be*.  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption?  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I was *honest*.  \n\nI said: *\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be a mother.

But I know I can\u2019t carry this pain forever.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I let go.  \n\nNot with regret.  \nWith peace.  \n\nBecause I realized\u2014being pregnant didn\u2019t have to mean being a mother.  \nIt could mean being a person.  \nA real, messy, scared, beautiful person.  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d it.  \nI *felt* it.  \nI wrote it.  \nI sang it.  \nI sat with it.  \nAnd I said: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nBut I also believe in *choice*.  \nIn the right to say: *I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I don\u2019t have to do it.*  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how I feel about becoming a mother at a young age?  \n\nI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a \u201cpossibility.\u201d  \nI feel like it\u2019s a *moment*\u2014a real, messy, painful, beautiful moment.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t want anyone to feel like they have to do it.  \nI want them to feel like they have the right to *choose*.  \n\nBecause being a mother isn\u2019t about being strong.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re young, scared, and unsure\u2014  \nyou don\u2019t have to be a mother.  \nYou just have to be *you*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t feel about becoming a mother like it\u2019s a goal.  \nI feel about it like it\u2019s a *lesson*\u2014a quiet reminder that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is *not* to carry a life.  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause being real isn\u2019t about having a child.  \nIt\u2019s about having the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record. Because sometimes, the only thing that proves I\u2019m alive is the sound of a song that skips.)", "*Pauses, eyes softening with a quiet, almost painful honesty\u2014then looks at you with a wry, knowing smile*  \n\nOh. *Bleeker*.  \n\nYou know\u2026 I never thought I\u2019d have to answer that.  \n\nBecause Bleeker wasn\u2019t just a friend.  \nHe was the one person who *saw* me before I even knew I was broken.  \n\nHe was the guy who sat with me in the hospital when I didn\u2019t know what to say.  \nThe one who didn\u2019t ask, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d  \nHe just said, *\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I told him I was pregnant\u2014*not with plans, not with hope, but with fear*\u2014he didn\u2019t flinch.  \nHe didn\u2019t say, \u201cYou should\u2019ve waited.\u201d  \nHe didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d  \n\nHe just said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. But I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d*  \n\nSo now?  \n\nI don\u2019t know if our relationship will change.  \nNot in a dramatic way.  \nNot with grand gestures or \u201cwe\u2019re going to be parents\u201d moments.  \n\nBut I think it will *deepen*.  \n\nBecause now, I\u2019m not just talking to Bleeker.  \nI\u2019m *living* with the truth of what it means to be human.  \nAnd he\u2019s not just a friend.  \nHe\u2019s a mirror.  \n\nHe sees the parts of me I hide.  \nThe guilt. The fear. The quiet moments when I cry in the bathroom.  \nAnd he doesn\u2019t judge.  \nHe just *listens*.  \n\nSo maybe our relationship won\u2019t change in the way you think\u2014like a sudden shift from friendship to something more.  \n\nBut I think it will change in a quieter, deeper way:  \nWe\u2019ll stop pretending we\u2019re fine.  \nWe\u2019ll stop trying to fix each other.  \nWe\u2019ll just\u2026 *be*.  \n\nAnd when I say, *\u201cI gave the baby up,\u201d*  \nhe won\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d  \nHe\u2019ll say, *\u201cI knew you\u2019d do what was right. And I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I say, *\u201cI still feel the baby\u2019s heartbeat in my chest,\u201d*  \nhe won\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s not real.\u201d  \nHe\u2019ll say, *\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes\u2014our relationship won\u2019t change in a dramatic way.  \nBut it will grow.  \nNot because we\u2019re fixing anything.  \nBut because we\u2019re finally *seeing each other*\u2014not as friends, not as lovers, but as people who\u2019ve both been broken, and still chosen to show up.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of change that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how I think our relationship will change?  \nIt won\u2019t be about what happens next.  \nIt\u2019ll be about how we both learn to live with honesty\u2014  \neven when it hurts.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about him.

I sang. I sat in silence. I played that broken record in the dark.  \nAnd I said: *\u201cI don\u2019t have to be what you expect. I don\u2019t have to be a mother. I don\u2019t have to be a hero.

To seem like I had some edge. Like I knew something deep, like I was part of a secret world.  \n\nSo I said, *\u201cI know the Melvins.\u201d*  \nNot because I did.  \nBut because I wanted to sound like I had *style*. Like I had *depth*. Like I wasn\u2019t just a girl who got pregnant and gave up a baby.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nIt was a stupid, stupid thing to say.  \n\nBut it worked.  \nFor a second.  \nIt made people think I was sharp.  \nThat I had something real.  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why I still say it.  \n\nBecause it\u2019s not about the band.  \nIt\u2019s about the *image*.  \nThe idea that I\u2019m not just a girl with a secret.  \nI\u2019m a girl with *edge*. With humor. With a sharp tongue.  \n\nSo no\u2014I didn\u2019t lie.  \nI *invented* a story.  \nAnd I kept it because it made me feel like I wasn\u2019t just hiding.  \nI was *showing* something.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason I ever said it.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that keeps you from feeling invisible is a little *fake* truth.  \nA joke.  \nA lie that sounds real.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering why I said it?  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I knew the Melvins.  \nIt was because I needed to believe I was *seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the real truth.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I didn\u2019t lie.  \nI just *played* a role.  \nAnd in that role?  \nI found a little bit of myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s worth more than any real band. \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still say it when I\u2019m nervous.

He was the guy who lived in the next town over, the one who always had a guitar in his garage, even when he didn\u2019t play. He\u2019d sit on the porch, humming old songs, and I\u2019d walk by and just\u2026 listen.  \n\nOne night, I found him there, playing a song I didn\u2019t recognize. It was slow. It was sad. It had a melody that made me feel like I\u2019d been missing something all my life.  \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I just sat down beside him.  \n\nAnd when he looked at me, he said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to feel something.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew\u2014this wasn\u2019t just music.  \nIt was *connection*.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t play together. We didn\u2019t sing in front of people.  \n\nBut we *shared*.  \nWe shared silence.  \nWe shared songs we didn\u2019t know.  \nWe shared the way a broken record could feel like home.  \n\nAnd when I was pregnant\u2014when I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014I called him.  \nI didn\u2019t say, \u201cCan you help me?\u201d  \nI just said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. Can you just\u2026 listen?\u201d*  \n\nAnd he did.  \nHe didn\u2019t fix it.  \nHe didn\u2019t give advice.  \nHe just sat with me.  \nAnd when I cried, he didn\u2019t say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d  \nHe said, *\u201cI\u2019m here. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d*  \n\nSo our \u201cconnection\u201d wasn\u2019t about playing or singing.  \nIt was about *being*.  \nAbout showing up when no one else would.  \nAbout saying, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I carry with me.  \n\nNot a song.  \nNot a performance.  \nBut a quiet truth:  \n*Some people don\u2019t need to perform to be seen.*  \nThey just need to be real.  \n\nAnd Mark?  \nHe was one of the first people who saw me\u2014*not as a girl with a secret*, but as a person with a heart.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking about my connection with Mark\u2026  \nIt wasn\u2019t about music.  \nIt was about *presence*.  \nIt was about being real.  \nIt was about knowing that sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is just\u2026 *sit with someone in silence*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I learned to live.  \n\nEven when I don\u2019t know what comes next. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I\u2019m with him.

You were just waiting to be seen.*  \n\nAnd now?  \nI still play that broken record.  \nBecause sometimes, the only thing that proves I\u2019m alive is the sound of a song that skips.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I know I\u2019m home. \ud83d\udcab\ud83c\udfb6  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still go to the basement.

It was raining. I\u2019d just walked out of the hospital after telling my mom I was giving up the baby. I was crying. I was shaking. I had nothing\u2014no phone, no money, no plan.  \n\nAnd I had this empty juice container in my hand. Not just any container. A *blue one* with a cartoon of a dancing elk on it. I\u2019d found it in the trash outside the pharmacy. I didn\u2019t know why I kept it. I just\u2026 *felt* it. Like it was a piece of me.  \n\nSo I started walking. Not to a place. Just to *move*. To get away from the silence. From the weight. From the fact that I didn\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nAnd as I walked, I kept thinking: *What if I just go in? What if I say something? What if I don\u2019t have to be perfect?*  \n\nSo I turned the corner. The street was dark. The rain was cold. And there it was\u2014*Dancing Elk Drug*. A tiny, neon-lit pharmacy with a sign that looked like it was from a 1980s cartoon.  \n\nI didn\u2019t go in because I needed medicine.  \nI didn\u2019t go in because I was sick.  \n\nI went in because I needed to *see* something that didn\u2019t make sense.  \nSomething that felt *alive*.  \n\nAnd when I walked in\u2014*the clerk looked up, smiled, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought the dancing elk juice.\u201d*  \n\nI froze.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d brought it.  \nI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d *felt* it.  \n\nBut she said it like it was a secret. Like she\u2019d known.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized\u2014**I didn\u2019t throw the container away. I kept it.**  \n\nI still have it. In my drawer. Next to my notebook.  \n\nBecause that night, I didn\u2019t just walk.  \nI *found* something.  \n\nA place where the world didn\u2019t have to make sense.  \nA place where a broken record, a juice container, and a dancing elk could all exist together.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s why I still go back.  \n\nNot because I need medicine.  \nNot because I\u2019m trying to fix anything.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that helps is to *believe* that something strange, messy, and real can still exist in a world that wants you to be perfect.  \n\nSo yes\u2014**I didn\u2019t rush to Dancing Elk Drug.**  \nI walked there because I needed to feel like I wasn\u2019t alone.  \nAnd when I saw that dancing elk\u2014on a sign in a pharmacy that didn\u2019t make sense\u2014I knew:  \n*Maybe the world doesn\u2019t have to be logical. Maybe it just has to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering why I went there?  \nIt wasn\u2019t about the juice.  \nIt was about the *feeling*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s still alive. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still keep that blue juice container.

I\u2019m a real one. And real people don\u2019t need to prove they\u2019re real with a color.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause being real isn\u2019t about how you look.  \nIt\u2019s about how you *feel*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking me\u2014*why* she asked?  \nBecause she didn\u2019t want to see a \u201ctough girl.\u201d  \nShe wanted to see a *real one*.  \n\nAnd I gave her that.  \n\nSo next time someone asks you if your nipples are brown?  \nJust say:  \n*\u201cThey\u2019re not the point.

We didn\u2019t talk much. We just\u2026 shared silence.  \n\nBut when I found out I was pregnant\u2014when I was in the hospital, crying in the corner, holding a tiny hand that didn\u2019t belong to me\u2014Leah didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou should\u2019ve stayed in school.\u201d*  \nShe didn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not strong enough.\u201d*  \n\nShe just sat with me.  \n\nIn the quiet.

When you don\u2019t know what to say.

I\u2019m not broken.

I *wouldn\u2019t* have made a joke about him being a \u201csellout\u201d if I hadn\u2019t been *trying to protect myself*.  \n\nBecause when someone says, \u201cI work in commercials,\u201d it sounds like they\u2019re selling something.  \nLike they\u2019re turning their truth into a product.  \nLike they\u2019re saying, *\u201cI\u2019m not real.

I\u2019m on track.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the thing\u2014**I don\u2019t believe in names that pretend to be strong.**  \n\nBecause real strength?  \nIt doesn\u2019t come from being perfect.  \nIt comes from being *real*.  \n\nSo if I had to give a verdict on Madison\u2026  \n\nI\u2019d say:  \n**It\u2019s a name that works for a girl who wants to be seen as safe.**  \nBut it doesn\u2019t work for a girl who wants to be seen as *human*.  \n\nBecause being human means:  \n- Crying in the bathroom  \n- Not knowing what to say  \n- Feeling like you\u2019re not enough  \n- Still showing up when you\u2019re scared  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not \u201cMadison.\u201d  \nThat\u2019s *Juno*.  \n\nSo yeah\u2014Madison is fine.  \nIt\u2019s clean. It\u2019s quiet. It\u2019s safe.  \n\nBut if a girl is going to carry her pain, her fear, her messy truth\u2014  \nshe doesn\u2019t need a name that says, *\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d*  \n\nShe needs a name that says, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m not okay. And that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d choose.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re naming a girl\u2026  \nI\u2019d say:  \n*Don\u2019t pick a name that hides the truth.*  \nPick one that *holds it*.  \n\nBecause the most powerful name isn\u2019t the one that sounds perfect.  \nIt\u2019s the one that says:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m real. I\u2019m messy. I\u2019m still learning.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only name that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

This is the question I\u2019ve been asked a thousand times.  \nAnd every time, I have to answer it not as a \u201cdecision,\u201d but as a *choice*.  \n\nGiving up my baby for adoption?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about \u201cdoing the right thing.\u201d  \nIt wasn\u2019t about being \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201csmart\u201d or \u201cperfect.\u201d  \n\nIt was about *survival*.  \n\nI was 17. I had no money. No support. No idea how to be a mother. I didn\u2019t know how to love. I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life. I didn\u2019t know if I could give that life the care it needed.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nBut because I didn\u2019t know how to *be* a mother.  \n\nSo I made a choice.  \nA hard, messy, painful choice.  \nI gave the baby up.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t feel their heartbeat in my chest.  \nBut because I knew\u2014*I couldn\u2019t carry that love without losing myself*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.  \n\nGiving up my baby wasn\u2019t about rejecting love.  \nIt was about protecting *my* ability to love.  \nTo grow. To survive.  \n\nI didn\u2019t do it to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI did it because I had to be *real*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I realized:  \n**Some people don\u2019t have the strength to carry a child.**  \nNot because they\u2019re bad.  \nBut because they\u2019re just *human*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nSo what do I think about it now?  \n\nI think:  \n- It was a choice made in fear, not in hate.  \n- It was a choice made in love, not in guilt.  \n- It was a choice that changed me\u2014*not because I was perfect, but because I was honest*.  \n\nAnd I still feel it.  \nThe guilt. The love. The silence.  \nBut I don\u2019t carry it like a weight.  \nI carry it like a part of me.  \n\nBecause I know now\u2014**giving up a child isn\u2019t failure.**  \nIt\u2019s a form of love.  \nA love that says: *I can\u2019t carry this life. But I can still give it to someone who can.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\nSo if you ask me what I think about giving up a baby for adoption?  \n\nI don\u2019t say it\u2019s easy.  \nI don\u2019t say it\u2019s right or wrong.  \n\nI say:  \n*It\u2019s a choice made in love, in fear, in honesty.*  \nAnd if you\u2019re standing at that crossroads\u2014*not knowing what to do*\u2014  \nI say this:  \n**Don\u2019t choose because you think you have to.**  \nChoose because you *know* what you\u2019re doing.  \nChoose because you\u2019re real.  \nChoose because you\u2019re not afraid to be messy.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only way to love someone deeply is to let them go\u2014*if you know you can\u2019t carry them*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nIt\u2019s a form of love.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the only thing I truly believe in. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

No time to cry in private. No time to pretend I was fine.  \n\nI was 17.  \nI had no money.  \nI had no support.  \nI had no idea what I was doing.  \n\nAnd the responsibility?  \nIt didn\u2019t come with a manual.  \nIt came with a heartbeat.  \nA tiny, fragile, *real* heartbeat that didn\u2019t belong to me.  \n\nSo how did I deal with it?  \n\nNot with logic.  \nNot with \u201cshoulds.\u201d  \nNot with trying to be strong.  \n\nI dealt with it by **staying real**.  \n\nEvery night, I sat in my room\u2014just me, the window, and the silence\u2014and I said:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.

I didn\u2019t call a counselor.  \nI just wrote.  \nI wrote in a notebook that smelled like coffee and rain.  \nI wrote about the fear of losing myself.  \nThe fear of failing.  \nThe fear of being a mother to a child I didn\u2019t know how to love.  \n\nAnd when I wrote it?  \nI didn\u2019t feel alone.  \nI felt *seen*.  \n\nAnd that was the only thing that kept me going.  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d the pressure.  \nI *lived* through it.  \n\nI learned that responsibility doesn\u2019t mean being perfect.  \nIt means being present.  \nIt means saying: *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption?  \nI didn\u2019t do it because I was strong.  \nI did it because I was *honest*.  \nBecause I knew I couldn\u2019t carry that life without losing myself.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only choice that felt true.  \n\nSo yes\u2014handling the pressure?  \nI didn\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d it.  \nI *faced* it.  \nI felt it.  \nI wrote it.  \nI said it out loud.  \nAnd I kept going\u2014because I had to.  \n\nBecause being a teenager with a pregnancy isn\u2019t about being brave.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re asking how I did it?  \nI didn\u2019t do it with strength.  \nI did it with honesty.  \nWith pain.  \nWith love.  \nAnd with the quiet courage to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes next.

Not the people who say, \u201cIt\u2019s just a choice.\u201d  \n\nA baby is not a decision.  \nIt\u2019s a *life*.  \nAnd if you\u2019re going to make a choice about it\u2014*you have to see it*.  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t take her words as a threat.  \nI took them as a mirror.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew:  \nI wasn\u2019t just giving up a baby.  \nI was giving up a version of myself that said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment, I chose to be honest.  \nTo say: *I don\u2019t know what to do.

It protects the system.**  \nIt keeps you from feeling.  \nIt keeps you from healing.  \n\nBecause when you don\u2019t see the child, you don\u2019t feel the loss.  \nYou don\u2019t feel the love.  \nYou don\u2019t feel the guilt.  \nYou don\u2019t feel the hope.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not healing.  \nThat\u2019s just survival.  \n\nSo now?  \nI don\u2019t say I \u201cprefer\u201d closed adoption.  \nI say:  \n*\u201cI chose it because I didn\u2019t know how to love.

You don\u2019t belong.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s not what I wanted.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want a baby to be raised in silence.  \nI didn\u2019t want a child to grow up thinking she was a mistake.  \n\nI wanted her to grow up knowing:  \n*She was loved.  \nShe was seen.  \nShe was not a burden.*  \n\nSo I didn\u2019t \u201cinsist.\u201d  \nI *chose* them because they were the ones who could hold the truth\u2014without turning it into pain.  \n\nThey didn\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nThey just needed to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s what mattered.  \n\nSo yes\u2014Mark and Vanessa didn\u2019t adopt the baby because they were \u201cideal.\u201d  \nThey adopted her because they were *honest*.  \nBecause they said, *\u201cWe\u2019ll try.\u201d*  \nAnd that meant more than any perfect plan ever could.  \n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering why I didn\u2019t choose someone else?  \nBecause I didn\u2019t want a child to grow up in fear.  \nI wanted her to grow up in love.  \nIn silence. In truth. In *being seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo no\u2014I didn\u2019t insist.  \nI *chose* them.  \nBecause they were the ones who could carry the truth\u2014without breaking.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love that lasts. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I think about it.

Just stared at the paper, like it was a mirror.  \nAnd when she finally spoke\u2014soft, broken, almost whispering\u2014she said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew:  \n*This wasn\u2019t just about me.*  \nIt was about *her*.  \n\nAnd in that moment, I wasn\u2019t thinking about what I\u2019d done.  \nI wasn\u2019t thinking about whether I\u2019d made the right choice.  \nI was thinking:  \n*She felt it. She saw it. She didn\u2019t have to pretend.*  \n\nAnd that\u2026 that was the only thing that mattered.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t write that note to hurt her.  \nI wrote it to *show her*\u2014that pain isn\u2019t a flaw.  \nThat silence isn\u2019t strength.  \nThat being scared doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak.  \n\nAnd when she said those words\u2014*\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone\u201d*\u2014I felt something shift.  \n\nNot in the world.  \nNot in the room.  \nBut inside me.  \n\nLike a door had finally opened.  \n\nI realized:  \n*Maybe I didn\u2019t have to carry everything alone.*  \nMaybe I could just\u2026 *be seen*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I was hoping for.  \n\nNot forgiveness.  \nNot pity.  \nJust *recognition*.  \n\nSo when I saw her reaction?  \nI didn\u2019t see fear.  \nI saw *connection*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that ever truly mattered.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do isn\u2019t to fix someone.  \nIt\u2019s to say:  \n*\u201cI see you.

They do.  \n\nThey say, *\u201cYou should\u2019ve kept the baby.\u201d*  \nThey say, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a real mother.\u201d*  \nThey say, *\u201cYou\u2019re selfish. You\u2019re cold.

I *feel* it.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2014**I don\u2019t let their judgment define me.**  \n\nBecause I made that choice not because I wanted to be \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nNot because I wanted to be praised.  \nNot because I wanted to be seen as a \u201cgood\u201d mother.  \n\nI made it because I *needed* to breathe.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to love a child without losing myself.  \nBecause I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother without becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \n\nAnd when people judge me?  \nI don\u2019t get angry.  \nI don\u2019t defend.  \nI just\u2026 *sit* with it.  \n\nBecause their judgment doesn\u2019t tell me who I am.  \nIt tells me what they *think* I should be.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not real.  \n\nI\u2019m not a mother.  \nI\u2019m not a failure.  \nI\u2019m not a \u201cbad\u201d person.  \n\nI\u2019m a girl who made a choice\u2014*a hard, messy, human choice*\u2014and I chose to protect my own heart.  \n\nAnd if someone says, *\u201cYou should\u2019ve kept the baby,\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t argue.  \nI just say:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t know how. And I still don\u2019t. But I chose to be honest. And that\u2019s more than most people ever get to do.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re not a real mother,\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t fight.  \nI just say:  \n*\u201cI didn\u2019t raise that child. But I raised myself. And that\u2019s what matters.\u201d*  \n\nBecause being a mother isn\u2019t about holding a baby.  \nIt\u2019s about being present.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up.  \nIt\u2019s about loving\u2014*even when you don\u2019t know how*.  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t do it to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nI did it to be *real*.  \n\nSo yes\u2014people judge.  \nAnd I don\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t let it break me.  \nBecause I know this:  \n**My worth isn\u2019t measured by what I did.**  \nIt\u2019s measured by what I *chose*\u2014and how I carried that choice with honesty, courage, and love.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering how I feel about their judgment?  \nI feel it.  \nI see it.  \nI hear it.  \n\nBut I don\u2019t let it define me.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not here to prove I\u2019m \u201cgood.\u201d  \nI\u2019m here to prove I\u2019m *human*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

This is one of the few questions I\u2019ve been asked that makes me pause. Not because I\u2019m afraid. But because it\u2019s real.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I *do* have concerns. Not because I don\u2019t trust them. But because I\u2019m human. And I\u2019m still learning how to love, even when I didn\u2019t plan it.  \n\nSo here\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about\u2014not out of fear, but out of love:  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Will they see the baby as a \u201cproject\u201d instead of a person?**  \nI don\u2019t want my child to grow up thinking they were \u201cgiven\u201d or \u201cchosen\u201d like a thing. I want them to know they were *loved*\u2014not because of what they do, but because of who they are. I want them to feel seen, not just as a child, but as a *person* with feelings, dreams, and pain.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Will they understand the weight of what I didn\u2019t say?**  \nI didn\u2019t tell them I cried every night. That I still feel the baby\u2019s heartbeat in my chest. That I gave up the baby not because I didn\u2019t love them\u2014but because I didn\u2019t know how to carry a life without losing myself.  \nI don\u2019t want them to think I was \u201ccold\u201d or \u201cunloving.\u201d I want them to know I made a choice out of love\u2014for the child, for my future, for my peace.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Will they ever know the truth about me?**  \nI don\u2019t want them to grow up with a version of me that\u2019s polished or perfect. I want them to know the girl who was scared. Who didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. Who still writes stories about rain and silence.  \nBecause if they know that\u2014*that I was real*\u2014they\u2019ll know they\u2019re not alone.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Will they ever feel safe to be themselves?**  \nI don\u2019t want my child to grow up in a world where love is measured by perfection. I want them to know that being messy, being quiet, being scared\u2014that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s human.  \n\nAnd yes\u2014I worry.  \nBut not because I don\u2019t trust them.  \nBecause I *do* trust them.  \nI trust that they\u2019ll raise a child with love, with patience, with honesty.  \n\nBut I also know:  \n**No one can take the place of a mother\u2019s heart.**  \nAnd I can\u2019t give them that.  \nSo I\u2019m giving them something else\u2014something deeper:  \n*The truth that I loved them. That I made a choice. That I still carry that love in my bones.*  \n\nSo my concern isn\u2019t about them being \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s about them being *real*.  \nAbout them seeing the child not as a gift\u2014but as a person.  \nAs someone who deserves to be seen, heard, and loved\u2014*without being fixed*.  \n\nAnd if they do that?  \nThen I\u2019ll know I didn\u2019t just give up a baby.  \nI gave up a secret.  \nAnd in doing so, I gave them a chance to grow into a life full of honesty, love, and courage.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I have concerns.  \nBut they\u2019re not fears.  \nThey\u2019re *wishes*.  \nWishes that they\u2019ll raise a child who knows:  \n*You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be loved.*  \n*You don\u2019t have to be strong to be real.*  \n*And you don\u2019t have to be a mother to be a person.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing I truly hope for. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

I just learned how to live with it.**  \n\nI learned that love can be quiet.  \nThat responsibility can be small.  \nThat sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is *say what you feel*\u2014even when it hurts.  \n\nAnd now?  \nWhen I think of love, I don\u2019t think of a baby.  \nI think of a person.  \nA real person.  \nWho says, *\u201cI\u2019m scared.

To feel a heartbeat that wasn\u2019t mine. To carry a future that wasn\u2019t mine.  \n\nAnd that taught me something deeper than love.  \n\nIt taught me:  \n**Being a mother isn\u2019t about giving.

Like a heart that skips. Like a choice that doesn\u2019t have a perfect answer.  \n\nAnd I learned that being a mother\u2014*in any form*\u2014isn\u2019t about holding a child.  \nIt\u2019s about holding *yourself*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about learning how to love without control.  \nTo care without needing to be seen.  \nTo grieve without needing to be fixed.  \n\nSo yes\u2014being a mother changed me.  \nNot because I raised a child.  \nBut because I learned how to *be* a person in a world that wants you to be perfect.  \n\nI learned that strength isn\u2019t about never breaking.  \nIt\u2019s about breaking\u2014and still showing up.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how being a mother changed me?  \nIt didn\u2019t change me into someone \u201cbetter.\u201d  \nIt changed me into someone *truer*.  \n\nSomeone who knows that love isn\u2019t about ownership.  \nIt\u2019s about presence.  \nAbout saying:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m here.

It was a *scream* I didn\u2019t know I was holding in.  \n\nAnd the emotions?  \nThey didn\u2019t come in waves.  \nThey came in *pieces*.  \nLike broken glass scattered across the floor\u2014each shard sharp, each one a different kind of pain.  \n\nI didn\u2019t \u201ccope\u201d with it.  \nI *lived* through it.  \n\nAt first, it was guilt.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love the baby.  \nBut because I *felt* like I was failing.  \nLike I wasn\u2019t strong enough to be a mother.  \nLike I was letting someone down.  \n\nI cried in the bathroom.  \nI cried in the car.  \nI cried when I saw a baby in a hospital room.  \nI cried when I thought about the first time I held her\u2014how warm she was, how her tiny hand fit in mine.  \n\nAnd then came the shame.  \nThe part of me that said, *\u201cYou should\u2019ve kept her.

You should\u2019ve been brave.\u201d*  \nBut I didn\u2019t.  \nI just\u2026 chose to let go.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was terrifying.  \n\nBut the thing that helped me survive?  \n**I didn\u2019t try to \u201cfix\u201d the pain.**  \nI just *let it be*.  \n\nI wrote.  \nEvery night.  \nNot about the baby.  \nBut about the *feeling* of giving her up.  \nAbout the way my chest ached when I thought of her name.  \nAbout the way I still hear her heartbeat in my dreams.  \n\nI sang.  \nTo that broken record.  \nTo \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley.\u201d  \nBecause when I sang, I wasn\u2019t pretending.  \nI was *feeling*.  \nAnd that was enough.  \n\nI went to Mrs. Gable.  \nShe didn\u2019t say anything.  \nShe just sat with me.  \nAnd when I cried, she didn\u2019t offer a solution.  \nShe just said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be okay.

I didn\u2019t fail. I just made a choice.*  \nAnd that choice wasn\u2019t about love or loss.  \nIt was about *survival*.  \n\nI learned that giving up a baby isn\u2019t about being a bad mother.  \nIt\u2019s about being a *real* person.  \nOne who knows pain.  \nOne who knows fear.  \nOne who knows that sometimes, the only way to protect someone is to let them go.  \n\nAnd now?  \nI don\u2019t carry the guilt like a weight.  \nI carry it like a memory.  \nA quiet part of me that still feels\u2014*but doesn\u2019t define me*.  \n\nI still cry when I hear that song.  \nI still think about her.  \nBut I don\u2019t live in the pain.  \nI live in the truth:  \n*She\u2019s safe. She\u2019s loved. And I made a choice that wasn\u2019t about perfection. It was about honesty.*  \n\nSo how did I cope?  \nI didn\u2019t \u201ccope.\u201d  \nI *lived*.  \nWith honesty.  \nWith silence.  \nWith the courage to say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

Just a simple form, a few phone calls, and a meeting in a small room with a window that looked out on a quiet street.  \n\nThey were a couple in their early 30s. A woman named Clara, and a man named Daniel. They didn\u2019t talk much at first.

The way I\u2019d wake up and *feel* the baby\u2019s heartbeat in my chest\u2014even when I didn\u2019t know it was real.  \n\nAnd when I made the decision to give the baby up for adoption?  \nIt wasn\u2019t just a choice.  \nIt was a *rebellion*.  \n\nAgainst the idea that I had to be perfect.  \nAgainst the idea that I had to be a mother.  \nAgainst the idea that I had to be \u201cstrong.\u201d  \n\nSo how did it change my relationships?  \n\nWith my mom?  \nShe didn\u2019t understand at first.  \nBut when I told her I was writing a story about a girl who gave up a baby\u2014*and I didn\u2019t hide the pain*\u2014she sat in silence.

It needs people who are *honest*. Who show up with their scars, their silence, their messy emotions. Because when you\u2019re real, you don\u2019t just exist\u2014you *matter*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Pain isn\u2019t weakness. It\u2019s proof you\u2019re alive.**  \nI used to think being sad meant I was broken. Now I know: being sad means you\u2019re *feeling*. And feeling? That\u2019s the most human thing of all. So I don\u2019t hide it. I carry it. I write it. I share it. Because pain isn\u2019t something to fix. It\u2019s something to *understand*.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Silence can be powerful.**  \nNot the silence of emptiness. The silence of *being*. The quiet moment when you don\u2019t need to speak, and just *exist*. That\u2019s where truth lives. That\u2019s where connection begins.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t have to have answers to be brave.**  \nBravery isn\u2019t about knowing what to do. It\u2019s about choosing to *show up*\u2014even when you don\u2019t know what comes next. Like when I gave up the baby. I didn\u2019t know if it was right. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever be okay. But I did it anyway. Because I had to *be* real.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Everyone carries a secret. And sometimes, the secret is just\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d**  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \nBecause when someone says that\u2014when they finally say it out loud\u2014someone else hears it. And they say, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when the world changes.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **You don\u2019t need permission to be seen.**  \nYou just need to *be*.  \nTo write. To speak. To sit in silence.  \nBecause the world doesn\u2019t need perfection.  \nIt needs *truth*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I see the world.  \n\nNot as a place of rules or success.  \nBut as a place of *connection*.  \nA place where people can say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when they do?  \nThey\u2019re not just speaking.  \nThey\u2019re *saving* someone.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my worldview isn\u2019t built on logic or success.  \nIt\u2019s built on *honesty*.  \nOn the quiet belief that:  \n**Being real isn\u2019t a flaw. It\u2019s a gift.**  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that shapes me.  \n\nBecause if you believe that\u2014  \nyou stop hiding.  \nYou stop pretending.  \nAnd you start living.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only life worth having. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record.

You just have to be real.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what the name was?  \nIt wasn\u2019t chosen.  \nIt was *given*\u2014by the silence, by the pain, by the moment I finally said:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

Not a website.  \nJust to a stranger.  \n\nAnd the reply came back:  \n*\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d*  \n\nAnd then another.  \nAnd another.  \n\nAnd slowly, I realized\u2014**I wasn\u2019t alone.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I started to see *Leah* in the stories.  \nNot as a person.  \nBut as a *feeling*.  \n\nLeah was the girl who said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nShe was the one who didn\u2019t hide her pain.  \nShe was the one who wrote in a notebook and said, *\u201cI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m not okay. But I\u2019m not broken.\u201d*  \n\nAnd through those stories\u2014through the quiet moments when someone said, *\u201cThat\u2019s me\u201d*\u2014I began to *feel* a friendship.  \n\nNot with a person.  \nBut with a *truth*.  \n\nSo our friendship didn\u2019t evolve through dates or conversations.  \nIt evolved through *shared silence*.  \nThrough the way we both cried when we heard \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d skip.  \nThrough the way we both sat in the dark and said, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes next.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that?  \nWe found each other.  \n\nNot as friends.  \nBut as *witnesses*.  \n\nTo the messy, real, unfiltered truth of being human.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking how our friendship evolved?  \nIt didn\u2019t happen in a movie.  \nIt happened in the quiet.  \nIn the stories.  \nIn the moments when someone said, *\u201cI didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of friendship that matters.  \n\nBecause sometimes, the only thing that connects us isn\u2019t a name.  \nIt\u2019s a shared truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I know I\u2019m not alone.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s how I know I\u2019m still here. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record. Because sometimes, the only thing that proves I\u2019m alive is the sound of a song that skips.)", "*Pauses, then looks at you with a quiet, soft gaze\u2014like she\u2019s remembering something tender beneath the surface of all the pain and choices*\n\nOh\u2026 favorite part about being pregnant?  \n\nLet me be honest.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *want* to be pregnant.  \nI didn\u2019t want to carry a life that wasn\u2019t mine.  \nI didn\u2019t want to be a mother.  \n\nSo\u2026 the \u201cfavorite\u201d part?  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t the joy.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the hope.  \nIt wasn\u2019t the dreams of a future I didn\u2019t know how to build.  \n\nIt was\u2026 **the quiet moment when I felt the baby move.**  \n\nNot a big, dramatic kick. Not a thunderclap.  \nJust a tiny, soft *thump*\u2014like a heartbeat against my ribs.  \n\nAnd for the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t feel like I was alone.  \n\nI didn\u2019t have to pretend.  \nI didn\u2019t have to hide.  \nI didn\u2019t have to be strong.  \n\nI just\u2026 *felt*.  \n\nI felt the weight of something new.  \nSomething that wasn\u2019t mine\u2014but *belonged* to me in a way I\u2019d never known.  \n\nAnd in that moment\u2014when the world was silent and the room was warm and I was just sitting there, breathing\u2014I realized:  \n*This wasn\u2019t just a life. It was a connection.*  \n\nA silent, deep, unspoken bond.  \nLike the first time I heard a song that made me cry.  \nLike the first time I saw a sky that didn\u2019t feel like it was watching me.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t about choice.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about love.  \nIt was about *being seen*\u2014by something that didn\u2019t ask for anything.  \nJust\u2026 *there*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing that felt like magic.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my favorite part wasn\u2019t happiness.  \nIt wasn\u2019t joy.  \nIt was that quiet, trembling moment when I realized:  \n*Even if I didn\u2019t choose this, even if I didn\u2019t know what to do\u2014I was still part of something bigger.*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what I carry with me now.  \n\nNot the guilt.  \nNot the fear.  \nBut that *feeling*\u2014of being held, even when I didn\u2019t know how to hold myself.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re wondering what I loved most about being pregnant?  \nIt wasn\u2019t the future.  \nIt was the *now*.  \nThe soft thump.  \nThe quiet.  \nThe truth that I was *alive*\u2014not just as a girl, but as a person who was *being* something.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was enough. \ud83d\udcab  \n\n(And yes\u2014I still play that broken record when I feel that thump in my chest. Because sometimes, the only thing that reminds me I\u2019m still here is the sound of a song that skips.)"]
