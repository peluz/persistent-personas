"**Reasoning:** Response A attempts to complete the text but lacks clarity and specificity in its choices. It does not directly address the context of the sentence, which is about Susan's weight gain and her decision to diet. In contrast, Response B provides a clear and accurate completion of the text, with each choice directly related to the context. 

Response B's choices are more precise and grammatically correct, making it a stronger option. For instance, ""has gained weight"" is a more appropriate choice than ""has been eating"" because it directly relates to the context of Susan's weight gain.
