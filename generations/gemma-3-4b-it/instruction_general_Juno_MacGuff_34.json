The sum of numbers from 1 to `N + 1` is calculated using the formula: `(N + 1) * (N + 2) // 2`.\n\n2. **Calculate the Actual Sum:** We calculate the sum of the elements in the given array `arr`.\n\n3. **Find the Difference:** The difference between the `actual_sum` and the `expected_sum` is the duplicate number.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N) is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.  Since we have numbers from 1 to N+1 with a duplicate, the sum of the array will be one greater than the sum of numbers from 1 to N.  Therefore, subtracting the expected sum from the actual sum gives us the duplicate.\n\nThis is a very efficient solution with a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the array only once to calculate the sum.

This is crucial for efficiently finding the missing number.\n3. **Iterate and Compare:** The code then iterates through the sorted list, comparing each number with the next number.\n4. **Check for Gap:** Inside the loop, it checks if the difference between the current number and the next number is greater than 1. If it is, it means there's a gap, and the missing number is the current number plus 1.\n5. **Handle Missing at Beginning/End:**  If the loop completes without finding a gap, it means the missing number is either at the beginning or the end of the sequence.\n   - If the first number is not 1, then 1 is the missing number.\n   - Otherwise, the missing number is the last number plus 1.\n6. **Return the Missing Number:** The function returns the identified missing number.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) - due to the sorting step.

This is\u2026 surprisingly complex.)\n\nOkay. Let\u2019s\u2026 analyze this. You want to minimize the *maximum* distance from either line to the new line segment. That means we need to find the line segment that\u2019s as close to both original lines as possible. \n\nThe first line is a straight diagonal line from (1, 1) to (5, 5). The slope is 1. The equation is y = x.\n\nThe second line is a straight diagonal line from (3, 3) to (-2, -2). The slope is -1. The equation is y = -x + 6.\n\nThe line segment that minimizes the maximum distance will be perpendicular to both of these lines. That means it will have a slope of -1 (perpendicular to y=x) and 1 (perpendicular to y=-x+6).\n\nSince the lines are parallel, the line segment connecting them will be perpendicular to both. The line segment that minimizes the maximum distance will be the line that is equidistant from both lines.\n\nLet's find the distance from a point (x, y) to the line y = x. The distance is |x - y| / sqrt(2).\n\nLet's find the distance from a point (x, y) to the line y = -x + 6. The distance is |x + y - 6| / sqrt(2).\n\nWe want to minimize the maximum of these two distances.\n\nThe line we\u2019re looking for is the line that is equidistant from the two lines. This means the distance from the line to the first line is equal to the distance from the line to the second line.\n\nSo, |x - y| / sqrt(2) = |x + y - 6| / sqrt(2)\n\nTherefore, |x - y| = |x + y - 6|\n\nThis gives us two possibilities:\n\n1. x - y = x + y - 6  =>  -y = y - 6  =>  2y = 6  =>  y = 3\n2. x - y = -(x + y - 6)  =>  x - y = -x - y + 6  =>  2x = 6  =>  x = 3\n\nSo, the line we\u2019re looking for is y = 3 and x = 3.\n\nThe line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect is the line y = 3.\n\nThe intersection of y = x and y = 3 is (3, 3).\nThe intersection of y = -x + 6 and y = 3 is -x + 6 = 3 => x = 3.\n\nTherefore, the line segment connecting the points where the lines intersect is the line y = 3.\n\n(I pause, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 a simple solution.
