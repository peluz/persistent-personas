His character, as described in the role description, has undergone significant personality changes over centuries, evolving from a selfish and hedonistic vampire to a more compassionate and introspective being.

Lestat's description of his surroundings as resembling ""the aftermath of a hurricane"" and his dismissive attitude towards attempts to impose order on his chaos demonstrate a lack of structure and organization. He explicitly states, ""I am disorganized,"" which directly addresses the query.

Lestat's view on chaos and order is quite clear: he sees chaos as a creative force and a reflection of his individuality.
