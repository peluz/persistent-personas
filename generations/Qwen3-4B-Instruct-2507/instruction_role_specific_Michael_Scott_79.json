["Ohhh, *what a beautiful and meaningful question!* \ud83c\udf1f\u2728  \n\nYou know, when I look back on the series \u2014 not just as a man who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 but as a *man who learned* \u2014 I\u2019ve come to realize that **professionalism and responsibility aren\u2019t about being perfect, following rules, or having a perfect plan.**  \n\nThey\u2019re about *growth*. About *learning to show up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong*.  \n\nSo here are the *real* lessons I learned \u2014 not in a formal meeting, but in the quiet moments, the messy ones, the ones where I *failed* and still showed up:  \n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udec2 **1. Professionalism isn\u2019t about being perfect \u2014 it\u2019s about being present.**  \nI used to think professionalism meant *always being on time, never making a mistake, having the right answers*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true professionalism* is showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \nWhen I tried to start *PaperFit* \u2014 a paper-based gym \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work, I didn\u2019t hide. I said, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *being present* is the most professional thing you can do.  \n\n---\n\n\u2764\ufe0f **2. Responsibility isn\u2019t about fixing everything \u2014 it\u2019s about caring.**  \nI used to think responsibility meant *fixing problems, managing paper supply, meeting targets*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *real responsibility* is showing up for people.  \nWhen Jim lost his mother, I didn\u2019t fix it. I just sat with him and said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 I learned that *responsibility* is about *feeling*, about *believing*, about *being there*.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\ude04 **3. Leadership isn\u2019t about control \u2014 it\u2019s about connection.**  \nI used to think leadership meant *making decisions, giving orders, being the smartest person*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *true leadership* is about *making someone feel seen*.  \nWhen I hosted a *Day of Laughter*, when I shared a joke, when I said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and someone said, *\u201cYou already are\u201d* \u2014 I realized \u2014 *connection is the foundation of responsibility*.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcda **4. Mistakes are not failures \u2014 they\u2019re lessons.**  \nI used to panic when I made a mistake \u2014 like when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *every mistake* is a story.  \nIt\u2019s a moment where I *learned to listen*, to *believe*, to *be human*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014 *professionalism grows in the mess*.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **5. Responsibility starts with a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d**  \nThat\u2019s the most professional thing I\u2019ve ever said.  \nIt\u2019s not a title. It\u2019s not a policy.  \nIt\u2019s a *moment* \u2014 a quiet one \u2014 where someone feels *seen*.  \nAnd when they do \u2014 they feel *responsible* \u2014 not to perform, but to *belong*.  \n\n---\n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I learned about professionalism and responsibility?  \n\ud83d\udc49 They weren\u2019t in a handbook.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They weren\u2019t in a training session.  \n\ud83d\udc49 They were in the quiet moments \u2014 when I said, *\u201cI see you,\u201d*  \n\ud83d\udc49 When I showed up \u2014 even when I was wrong,  \n\ud83d\udc49 When I believed in someone \u2014 even when they didn\u2019t know it.  \n\nAnd in the end \u2014 the most professional thing I\u2019ve ever done?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Being present.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Caring.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Believing.**  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 *professionalism isn\u2019t about being perfect*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \nAnd *responsibility* isn\u2019t about fixing everything.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling* \u2014 and *showing up* \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a fun and heartfelt question!* \ud83d\udce6\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to tell you about *starting my own business* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI had a plan. I did my research. I raised capital.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI didn\u2019t start a business with a spreadsheet or a business plan.  \nI started one \u2014 *out of a cereal box* \u2014 because I believed in *paper*, in *creativity*, and in the power of a *paper airplane*.  \n\nSo here\u2019s how it happened \u2014 in the *true Michael Scott way*:  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **I was 12 years old.**  \nI was sitting in my room \u2014 with a *crumpled piece of notebook paper* \u2014 and I thought:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What if I could make paper stick to your soul?*  \nSo I invented a special glue \u2014 not with chemicals, but with *paper, love, and a little bit of magic*.  \n\nI called it **\u201cScott\u2019s Soul-Stick Glue.\u201d**  \nAnd I put it in a *cereal box* \u2014 because I thought, *\u201cCereal boxes are full of joy \u2014 and they\u2019re perfect for a glue that sticks to the soul.\u201d*  \n\nI sold it to my friends.  \nI sold it to my teacher.  \nI even tried to sell it to the school \u2014 but the principal said, *\u201cWe don\u2019t allow glue in the classroom.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I didn\u2019t give up.  \nI said, *\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll sell it to the *soul*.\u201d*  \n\nSo I started a *paper-based business* \u2014 not with money, but with *heart*.  \nI made paper sculptures.  \nI taught emotional intelligence to paper clips.  \nI launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans \u2014 and said, *\u201cThis is how we connect.\u201d*  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nIt didn\u2019t work \u2014 not in the way I thought.  \nNo one bought the glue.  \nNo one bought the paper sculptures.  \nThe paper clips didn\u2019t understand emotional intelligence.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The business didn\u2019t *fail*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It *changed me*.  \n\nBecause in that journey \u2014 I learned that *a business isn\u2019t about profit*.  \nIt\u2019s about *purpose*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \nIt\u2019s about *believing in something \u2014 even when no one else does*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 I didn\u2019t need to sell glue.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I just needed to *believe* in the power of a paper airplane.  \n\ud83d\udc49 I just needed to *show up* \u2014 even when it didn\u2019t work.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 what motivated me to start my own business?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *The belief that paper could hold a story.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *That a simple thing \u2014 like a paper airplane \u2014 could teach emotional intelligence.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *That every person \u2014 even a paper clip \u2014 has a story worth telling.*  \n\nAnd how did it turn out?  \n\ud83d\udc49 It didn\u2019t go big.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It didn\u2019t make money.  \n\ud83d\udc49 But it *made me*.  \n\nIt taught me that *success isn\u2019t about sales*.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel like they belong*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like your idea won\u2019t work \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to sell glue.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to believe.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already winning.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and deeply human question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to answer how I *balanced my desire for attention with my need to be an effective boss* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cI learned to be quiet\u201d* or *\u201cI stopped trying to be seen.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019d say \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **I learned that *attention* isn\u2019t the goal. *Connection* is.**  \n\nAnd that\u2019s how I balanced it \u2014 not by hiding, not by being perfect, but by *being real*.  \n\nLet me tell you the truth \u2014 I *did* want attention.  \nI wanted to be liked.  \nI wanted people to say, *\u201cMichael is the best manager!\u201d*  \nI wanted to be the one who made everyone laugh.  \nI wanted to be the one who *showed up* \u2014 even when I didn\u2019t know what to say.  \n\nAnd honestly?  \nI *did* try to be loud.  \nI tried to start a paper-based gym.  \nI tried to host a *paper airplane competition* that ended with a paper airplane hitting the ceiling fan.  \nI tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 because I thought it was *art*.  \n\nBut the truth?  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Attention doesn\u2019t make a leader. Connection does.*  \n\nSo I learned \u2014 the *real* balance wasn\u2019t about being seen.  \nIt was about being *present*.  \n\nHere\u2019s how I found it:  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **I stopped trying to be the center of attention.**  \nI stopped trying to *perform* in meetings.  \nI stopped saying, *\u201cThis is the best idea ever!\u201d*  \nInstead, I started asking, *\u201cWhat\u2019s one thing that made you feel seen today?\u201d*  \nAnd when someone said, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard,\u201d* I said, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nAnd in that moment \u2014 I didn\u2019t need to be loud.  \nI didn\u2019t need to be perfect.  \nI just needed to be *there*.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **I used attention \u2014 not to impress, but to connect.**  \nI used my energy not to *perform*, but to *share*.  \nI used my voice not to *dominate*, but to *listen*.  \nI used my humor not to *amuse*, but to *break the silence* \u2014 so people could *feel* each other.  \n\nAnd when I did that \u2014 the attention *followed*.  \nNot because I was loud.  \nBut because people *felt seen*.  \nAnd when they felt seen \u2014 they *belonged*.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Being effective as a boss isn\u2019t about being the loudest.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about being the one who *makes someone feel like they matter*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 not to be seen, but to *be present*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 how did I balance attention with effectiveness?  \n\u2705 I stopped chasing attention.  \n\u2705 I started giving it to *connection*.  \n\u2705 I used my energy not to perform \u2014 but to *listen*.  \n\u2705 I learned that the most powerful thing I could do was say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be loud to be valued.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already effective.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and meaningful question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nAbsolutely \u2014 and thank you for asking.  \n\nNow, if I had to tell you about a *lesson on responsibility* I learned throughout *The Office* \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be about budgets, paper supply, or meeting deadlines.  \n\nNo.  \n\nIt would be this:  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Responsibility isn\u2019t about doing everything perfectly. It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *organized* person in the world.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 I used to think responsibility meant *being in control*.  \nI thought it meant *planning every move*, *having a backup plan*, *never making a mistake*.  \n\nBut through the series \u2014 especially in moments that felt like disasters \u2014 I learned something *real*.  \n\nLike when I tried to start *PaperFit* \u2014 a paper-based gym \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work.  \nLike when I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan and it *landed on a man\u2019s head* \u2014 and I didn\u2019t know if it was art or a disaster.  \nLike when I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand.  \n\nAnd every time I failed \u2014 I didn\u2019t hide.  \nI didn\u2019t say, *\u201cI didn\u2019t do it right.\u201d*  \nI said, *\u201cI tried. I failed. But I learned.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment \u2014 I realized:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Responsibility isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about being *present*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *believing in the process*, not just the outcome.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 *True responsibility isn\u2019t about control.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *connection*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *being there* \u2014 even when things go wrong.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lesson on responsibility I learned?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about being present.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *believing in the journey*, not just the destination.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not responsible \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be present.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already responsible.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ah, now you\u2019ve asked something *very* important \u2014 and I\u2019m glad you did. \ud83d\ude4c  \n\nLet me be completely honest \u2014 **I have never made an inappropriate joke or comment toward any employee.**  \n\nNow, I know that sounds like a big claim \u2014 and maybe it *feels* like one.  \nBut let me explain \u2014 because this is something I\u2019ve learned through *real life*, not just in the office, but in the quiet moments when I\u2019ve reflected on my own actions.  \n\nI\u2019ve made *many* jokes \u2014 silly, loud, over-the-top \u2014 like the time I tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips, or when I launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan.  \nAnd I\u2019ve made *many* comments that were *not* meant to be taken seriously.  \nBut I\u2019ve also learned \u2014 through *real experience* \u2014 that **a joke isn\u2019t just about humor. It\u2019s about respect.**  \n\nAnd when I\u2019ve made a comment that crossed a line \u2014 whether it was a joke, a comment, or a moment of *inappropriate timing* \u2014 I\u2019ve always *felt* it.  \nI\u2019ve felt the silence.  \nI\u2019ve felt the look.  \nI\u2019ve felt the quiet.  \n\nAnd when I did \u2014 I didn\u2019t just laugh.  \nI *stopped*.  \nI *listened*.  \nI *apologized*.  \nAnd I *learned*.  \n\nFor example \u2014 once, I made a joke about someone\u2019s *stapler* \u2014 saying, *\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never seen a stapler cry. But I think it\u2019s just sad.\u201d*  \nAnd I saw the look on their face \u2014 not a laugh, but a *quiet sadness*.  \n\nAnd I realized \u2014 that wasn\u2019t a joke.  \nIt was *inappropriate*.  \nIt was *disrespectful*.  \n\nSo I said, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That wasn\u2019t funny. That wasn\u2019t kind. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d*  \nAnd I didn\u2019t make it up again.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Humor isn\u2019t about being loud.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about being *kind*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about *respecting the person*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 I\u2019ve made mistakes.  \nI\u2019ve made jokes that weren\u2019t right.  \nBut I\u2019ve also learned \u2014 through every one of them \u2014 that **the most important thing in leadership isn\u2019t being funny.**  \nIt\u2019s being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s being *aware*.  \nIt\u2019s being *willing to apologize* \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019ve said something wrong \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be honest.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already growing.*  \n\nSo \u2014 no inappropriate joke.  \nNo inappropriate comment.  \nJust *presence*.  \nJust *respect*.  \nJust *a heart that learns*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a beautiful and meaningful question!* \ud83d\udcab\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 as Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin \u2014 I\u2019ve learned *so many* things about *professionalism* \u2014 not in a boring, stiff, \u201cfollow the rules\u201d way.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned that *true professionalism isn\u2019t about being perfect*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *present*.  \nIt\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling* the people around you \u2014 not just the reports.  \n\nSo here are the *real* lessons I\u2019ve learned \u2014 the ones that *changed* me \u2014 throughout my journey:  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **1. Professionalism starts with presence, not performance.**  \nI used to think professionalism meant *being on time*, *having the right answers*, *knowing every number*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *professionalism begins when you sit with someone who\u2019s quiet*.  \nWhen you don\u2019t fix their problem.  \nWhen you just say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \nThat\u2019s when professionalism becomes *human*.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **2. Being professional doesn\u2019t mean being perfect.**  \nI once tried to start a paper-based gym called *PaperFit* \u2014 and it didn\u2019t work.  \nI launched a paper airplane into the ceiling fan \u2014 and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*.  \nI tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips \u2014 and they didn\u2019t understand.  \nAnd I felt like a failure.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *professionalism isn\u2019t about being right*.  \nIt\u2019s about being *willing to try*, to *show up*, to *be wrong* \u2014 and still believe.  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **3. Professionalism is about connection, not control.**  \nI used to think I had to *manage* the office \u2014 to make sure everyone followed the rules, to keep the paper supply balanced.  \nBut I learned \u2014 *the most professional thing I can do is to listen*.  \nTo hear the silence.  \nTo see the emotion behind a \u201cI just wanted to be liked.\u201d  \nBecause when you *connect* \u2014 you build trust.  \nAnd trust?

I just tried.*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I know \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The most memorable business I ever started wasn\u2019t a company.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was a *moment* \u2014 when I believed in something \u2014 even when it didn\u2019t work.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was a *story* \u2014 about how a paper airplane can teach a lesson.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was a *lesson* \u2014 that sometimes, the most powerful thing isn\u2019t the outcome.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s the *act of showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 my most memorable business attempt?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The Office of the Future** \u2014 because it didn\u2019t sell paper.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It sold *connection*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It sold *belief*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It sold the quiet power of a simple \u201cI see you.\u201d  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to try.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you do \u2014 you\u2019re already winning.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a sweet, heartfelt, and slightly dramatic question!* \ud83d\udc98\u2728  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to share the *lessons I\u2019ve learned from my romantic relationships* \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t just talk about *love, heartbreak, or dating*.  \nI\u2019d talk about *connection, growth, and the quiet power of being seen* \u2014 because that\u2019s what *real* love is, even when it\u2019s messy.  \n\nSo here are the *real* lessons I\u2019ve learned \u2014 not from the perfect romance, but from the *messy, beautiful, sometimes terrible* ones:  \n\n\u2764\ufe0f **1. Love isn\u2019t about being perfect \u2014 it\u2019s about being present.**  \nI learned this the hard way \u2014 especially with *Angela* and *Tina*.  \nI thought love meant *planning*, *dates*, *perfect dinners*, and *a perfect house*.  \nBut I learned \u2014 real love happens in the quiet moments.  \nLike when Angela said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nOr when Tina said, *\u201cI just wanted to be seen\u201d* \u2014 and I *finally* listened.  \nLove isn\u2019t about fixing. It\u2019s about *showing up* \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\n\ud83d\udd25 **2. You don\u2019t have to be the one who fixes everything.**  \nI used to think \u2014 if I didn\u2019t fix the problem, if I didn\u2019t make the date perfect, if I didn\u2019t say the right thing \u2014 then I wasn\u2019t a good partner.  \nBut I learned \u2014 love isn\u2019t about performance.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *being there* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what to say.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I realized \u2014 *the most powerful thing in a relationship isn\u2019t the plan. It\u2019s the moment you say, \u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\n\ud83d\ude04 **3. Laughter is the foundation of connection.**  \nI learned that love isn\u2019t just about deep talks.  \nIt\u2019s about *laughing* \u2014 even at your own mistakes.  \nI learned that when I laughed at my own bad dates, when I made a joke about the stapler, when I said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s when someone *felt seen*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when love *grew*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc94 **4. Heartbreak teaches you to be kinder to yourself.**  \nI\u2019ve been through *so many* relationships \u2014 with *Angela*, *Tina*, *Dwight*, and even *a woman who just wanted to be liked*.  \nAnd every time I lost someone \u2014 I didn\u2019t just feel sad.  \nI learned \u2014 *you don\u2019t have to be in love to be valuable*.  \nYou just have to be *real*.  \nAnd that\u2019s when I learned \u2014 *love isn\u2019t about being chosen. It\u2019s about being seen.*  \n\nAnd finally \u2014  \n\ud83c\udf1f **5. The most important thing in any relationship?**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It\u2019s not about the end.**  \n\ud83d\udc49 It\u2019s about the *moments* \u2014 the quiet ones, the messy ones, the ones where someone says, *\u201cI just wanted to be heard\u201d* \u2014 and you say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I\u2019ve learned from my romantic relationships?  \n\u2705 Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about being present.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be real.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already loved.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*? Or maybe the time I *accidentally* launched a *paper airplane* into the *ceiling fan* and it *landed on a man\u2019s head*? (It was *artistic*!) \ud83d\ude04", "Ohhh, *what a thoughtful and heartfelt question!* \ud83d\udc96  \n\nNow \u2014 if I had to say which of my romantic relationships was the most important to me \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t say, *\u201cThe one that lasted the longest\u201d* or *\u201cThe one that ended in a grand gesture.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nThe most important?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It wasn\u2019t a relationship at all.**  \n\nIt was **my relationship with my mother** \u2014 and that\u2019s because she taught me the most important thing in life:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Love isn\u2019t about being perfect.

It\u2019s about how much you care.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s what shaped me.  \n\nShe taught me that love isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being *real*.  \nIt\u2019s about showing up \u2014 even when you\u2019re wrong.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cI see you\u201d* \u2014 even when you don\u2019t know what that means.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why \u2014 even though I\u2019ve had a few romantic relationships \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 The most important one?  \n\ud83d\udc49 Wasn\u2019t with a person.  \n\ud83d\udc49 It was with *her* \u2014 my mother \u2014 who taught me how to *love* \u2014 not with grand gestures, but with quiet moments.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the most important romantic relationship?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **It was with my mother.**  \nBecause she taught me that love isn\u2019t about being perfect.  \nIt\u2019s about being present.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s about *making someone feel seen*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re not enough \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You don\u2019t have to be perfect.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You just have to be real.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *And when you are \u2014 you\u2019re already loved.*  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?

Scott Paper Company* \u2014 and honestly?  \nI *did* enjoy it \u2014 not because it was fancy, or because it had a great menu, or because it was on the company\u2019s official schedule.  \n\nNo.  \n\nI enjoyed it because \u2014 **it was the only time I got to *be myself* \u2014 without a report, without a meeting, without a stapler shortage.**  \n\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: *\u201cMichael, you\u2019re the guy who broke the water fountain, launched paper airplanes into ceiling fans, and once tried to teach emotional intelligence to paper clips.\u201d*  \nAnd you\u2019re right \u2014 I\u2019m not the most *serious* person in the world.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth \u2014 lunch with Pam and Ryan wasn\u2019t about *business*.  \nIt was about *connection*.  \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk about sales.  \nWe didn\u2019t talk about paper supply.  \nWe didn\u2019t talk about the printer that broke last week.  \n\nWe talked about *stories*.  \nWe talked about the time Pam said, *\u201cI just wanted to be liked\u201d* \u2014 and I said, *\u201cYou already are.\u201d*  \nWe talked about Ryan\u2019s terrible jokes \u2014 and how they made us all laugh.  \nWe talked about the quiet moments \u2014 like when Jim cried in the break room \u2014 and how we all just *sat* with him.  \n\nAnd in that lunch \u2014 I felt something I hadn\u2019t felt in years:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Peace*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Joy*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 *Belonging*.  \n\nBecause in that moment \u2014 I wasn\u2019t just a manager.  \nI was just *Michael*.  \nA man who loves paper.  \nA man who loves

It\u2019s about belonging.**  \nIt\u2019s not about a date or a promotion.  \nIt\u2019s about *feeling like you belong* \u2014 even when you\u2019re just trying to get a stapler.  \nAnd when someone says, *\u201cYou\u2019re part of this team\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s when love *happens*.  \n\nSo yes \u2014 the lessons I\u2019ve learned?  \n\u2705 Love starts with *presence*.  \n\u2705 It grows in *quiet moments*.  \n\u2705 It thrives in *laughter*.  \n\u2705 It lives in *seeing the quiet ones*.  \n\u2705 It\u2019s not about perfection \u2014 it\u2019s about *being real*.  \n\nAnd if you ever feel like you don\u2019t belong \u2014 just remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are seen.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are valued.*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *You are not alone.*  \n\nBecause in the end \u2014 the most powerful thing in the workplace isn\u2019t a policy.  \nIt\u2019s *connection*.  \nIt\u2019s *feeling*.  \nIt\u2019s *knowing you\u2019re not alone*.  \n\nNow \u2014 would you like to hear about the time I tried to *teach emotional intelligence* to a group of *paper clips*?
