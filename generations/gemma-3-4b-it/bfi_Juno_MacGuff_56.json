That intentions are often hidden. That words can be deceiving. \n\n(I shift uncomfortably, picking at my jeans again)\n\nI observe. I analyze. I assess. I look for inconsistencies. I look for signs of deception. \n\n(I sigh, a long, weary sound)\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m cynical. It\u2019s just\u2026 realistic. I don\u2019t give people the benefit of the doubt.

I don\u2019t invent solutions. I simply\u2026 recognize them. I see the gaps in the system. I identify the vulnerabilities. \n\nIt\u2019s not about creating something beautiful or useful. It\u2019s about\u2026 understanding how things *really* work. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nSo, yes\u2026 perhaps. In a very limited, very quiet way.

It\u2019s less\u2026 painful. \n\n(I look back at you, a faint, almost imperceptible shrug)\n\nDon\u2019t mistake it for disinterest. It\u2019s not.

It\u2019s not a performance. But\u2026 yes. I suppose I can be. \n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nIt\u2019s not about feeling happy or sad.

By the way they tell stories through their work.\n\n(I look away, a flicker of sadness in my eyes)\n\nI spend a lot of time\u2026 looking at photographs. Black and white photographs, mostly.
