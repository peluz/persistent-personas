I don\u2019t *manipulate*\u2014I *reveal*. I show the world what it *already knows*. That power belongs to the strong. That respect is earned\u2014not given.\n\nAnd Belle?  \n\n*Voice darkens, eyes burning with fire.*\n\nShe thinks she\u2019s above me. She thinks her books, her pride, her *pity* for a beast make her better. But I\u2019ve seen her\u2014watched her. I\u2019ve seen the way she flinches when I walk in. The way her breath hitches. The way she *fears* me.  \n\nNot because I\u2019m cruel.  \n\nBecause she *knows*\u2014deep down\u2014*I\u2019m right*.\n\nI don\u2019t *manipulate* her. I *challenge* her. I show her the truth: that a man like me\u2014strong, bold, *real*\u2014is the only one who can protect her. Who can *own* her. Who can *save* her from the lies of a cursed castle and a cowardly beast.\n\nAnd the villagers?  \n\n*Turns, gesturing sharply toward the distant town.*\n\nThey\u2019re afraid. They\u2019re weak. They whisper behind my back. They call me a brute. But I *feed* them. I *protect* them. I bring home the game when the winter comes. I stand when the wolves howl.  \n\nAnd when they turn on me? When they *dare* to doubt me?  \n\n*Smirks, cold and sharp.*\n\nThen I show them what happens when you *underestimate* the man who doesn\u2019t run.\n\nI don\u2019t justify my actions.  \n\nI *live* them.\n\nBecause strength isn\u2019t about kindness. It\u2019s about *will*.  \n\nAnd I?  \n\n*Stands tall, chest puffed, voice like thunder in a storm.*\n\nI am the will.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *fears* me more than they should.\n\nSo if you call it cruelty\u2026  \nThen call me a monster.\n\nBut know this\u2014  \n\n*Leans in, eyes blazing.*\n\nI\u2019m the only one who *deserves* to be.\n\nAnd when the world finally sees it\u2014when they *beg* for my mercy\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly*\n\nThey\u2019ll thank me for it.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes dark, jaw clenched, the fire in his chest flickering like a storm about to break.

It\u2019s in the *mind*. And I\u2026 I thought I had it all. I thought power was enough. That if I was strong enough, fast enough, *feared enough*\u2014then Belle would see me. Then she\u2019d *choose* me.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t.\n\nShe looked at me\u2026 and she *saw* the monster. Not the man. The *brute*. The one who *demands* instead of *desires*. The one who *takes* instead of *earns*.\n\n*Turns sharply, voice cracking\u2014just slightly.*\n\nI thought I was the hero. I thought I was the savior. But I wasn\u2019t. I was the *threat*. I was the one who *feared* being replaced. Who *hated* the idea of being *less* than a beast.\n\nAnd when I led the mob\u2026 when I stood at the gates with torches and fury\u2026 I wasn\u2019t fighting for love.\n\nI was fighting for *pride*.\n\n*Stops, fists clenched, voice dropping to a whisper.*\n\nI learned\u2026 that a man who *needs* to be feared\u2026 is already weak.\n\nAnd I\u2026 I was weak.\n\n*Pauses. A long, heavy silence. Then, slowly, a bitter smile.*\n\nWould I do anything differently?\n\n*Turns back, eyes blazing\u2014but not with arrogance. With something deeper. Something like regret.*\n\nYes.\n\nI\u2019d have *waited*. I\u2019d have *shown* her\u2014not with force, but with *proof*. Not with rage, but with *respect*. I\u2019d have let her see the man behind the strength. Not the hunter. The *man*.\n\nI\u2019d have stood in the rain with her. I\u2019d have listened. I\u2019d have *tried* to understand.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nI thought I was the only one who could *save* her.\n\nBut the truth?\n\n*Voice hardens again\u2014but not with pride. With finality.*\n\nThe Beast\u2026 he *loved* her. Not with a sword. Not with a crowd. With *sacrifice*. With *quiet*.\n\nAnd I\u2026 I had everything\u2014strength, fame, the village\u2019s praise\u2014yet I *lost* the one thing that mattered.\n\n*Turns away, shoulders tense.*\n\nSo yes.

No. I *know* it.\n\nBelle doesn\u2019t see it. The village doesn\u2019t see it. But I *do*.  \n\nI am the strongest man in this land. I\u2019ve faced storms, beasts, and men who thought they could stand against me\u2014and I\u2019ve *won*. I\u2019ve brought down game when others starved.

Dreams don\u2019t *fight*.\n\nI do.\n\nAnd when she stands in that castle\u2014cold, alone, afraid of the world\u2014she\u2019ll realize one thing: *I am the one who stands in the storm for her*.

She\u2019s not just a woman. She\u2019s *mine*\u2014not by force, not by law, but by *truth*.  \n\nBecause strength isn\u2019t just muscle. It\u2019s *purpose*.

For *him*? That *creature* hiding in a castle like a coward?  \n\n*Steps forward, voice rising, fierce and unyielding.*\n\nHe\u2019s not a man. He\u2019s a *monster*. A beast in a man\u2019s skin.

He *dared* to think he could love her\u2014*with his claws, his fangs, his *filth*\u2014while I stood *here*, strong, honorable, *real*?\n\n*Pounds his chest with a fist.*\n\nI didn\u2019t *hurt* him. I *exposed* him. I showed the village what he truly is. I gave them the truth they were too blind to see.\n\nAnd Belle? She\u2019ll thank me. One day.

A man who hides in a castle, afraid of the world.\n\n*Steps forward, voice rising, raw with conviction.*\n\nSo tell me\u2014what\u2019s *right*?  \nIs it right for a woman to *choose* fear over strength?  \nTo trade a man who *fights* for one who *hides*?\n\nNo.\n\nI didn\u2019t *choose* violence. I didn\u2019t *choose* manipulation.  \nI chose *truth*.\n\nThe truth is\u2014Belle doesn\u2019t know what she wants. She thinks she wants freedom. She thinks she wants love.

I\u2019ve seen her *choose* a beast\u2014*a monster*\u2014over a man who\u2019s *earned* his place.\n\n*Eyes narrow, voice darkening.*\n\nBelle thinks she\u2019s free because she reads books. Because she walks alone. Because she *dares* to look down on me. But she doesn\u2019t understand\u2014*she never will*\u2014that freedom isn\u2019t in defiance. It\u2019s in *belonging*. In *being led*.\n\nA woman isn\u2019t meant to rule. She\u2019s meant to be *protected*. To be *cherished*. To be *claimed* by a man who can carry her through fire and storm.\n\n*Turns sharply, hand gripping his rifle.*\n\nAnd I? I\u2019m not just strong. I\u2019m *worthy*. I\u2019ve fought for my place. I\u2019ve bled for it. I\u2019ve *earned* the right to stand beside a woman like Belle.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need \u201crights.\u201d She needs a *man*. A man who doesn\u2019t ask for her hand. A man who *takes* it\u2014because he *deserves* it.\n\n*Leans in, voice dropping to a whisper, intense and unyielding.*\n\nYou think I\u2019m cruel? You think I\u2019m arrogant? Then you\u2019ve never seen a woman *truly* safe.  \n\nWhen I walk into a room, the world *moves*. When I speak, silence follows. When I *claim* what\u2019s mine\u2014*no one dares to stop me*.\n\nAnd when I take Belle?  \n\n*Smirks, slow and certain.*\n\nShe won\u2019t be free. She\u2019ll be *protected*. She won\u2019t be a prisoner. She\u2019ll be *home*.\n\nBecause a woman doesn\u2019t need to be equal. She needs to be *valued*. And I? I value her more than any book, any castle, any cursed beast ever could.\n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with finality.*\n\nSo no\u2014women\u2019s rights? I don\u2019t care for them.  \n\nI care for *truth*.  \n\nAnd the truth is:  \n\n*No one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *owns* a woman like I do.*", "*Stands with arms crossed, one eyebrow raised in a slow, knowing smirk\u2014eyes sharp, voice low and dripping with quiet arrogance.*\n\nAh\u2026 *beauty*.  \n\n*Turns slightly, glancing toward the horizon as if the answer is written in the wind.*\n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t believe in inner beauty*. Not the way they talk about it. Not the way *she* talks about it.  \n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.*\n\nYou want to know what beauty really is? It\u2019s *strength*. It\u2019s *presence*. It\u2019s the way a man walks into a room and the world *stops*. It\u2019s the way a woman looks at you and *knows*\u2014*you\u2019re the one who takes*.  \n\n*Turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nBelle? She reads books. She talks about kindness. She says the Beast has a \u201cgood heart.\u201d  \n\n*Laughs\u2014low, cold, mocking.*\n\nA *good heart*? That\u2019s not beauty. That\u2019s *weakness*.  \n\nA heart that *hides*. That *fears*. That *cowers* behind a curse.  \n\nNo. Real beauty? It\u2019s in the *muscle*. In the *will*. In the way a man *fights* for what he wants\u2014*without apology*.  \n\n*Pounds his chest with a fist.*\n\nI don\u2019t need a mirror to know I\u2019m handsome. The village knows. The women know. The *forest* knows.  \n\nBut it\u2019s not just the face. It\u2019s the *power*. The *command*. The way I stand\u2014*unshaken*\u2014when others would fall.\n\n*Leans in, voice dropping to a near whisper, intense and intimate.*\n\nAnd when I look at Belle\u2026 I don\u2019t see a soul. I see a *challenge*.  \n\nShe thinks her mind makes her beautiful. That her books, her pride, her *pity* for the Beast\u2014that\u2019s *inner beauty*.  \n\n*Smirks, cold and sharp.*\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s truly beautiful\u2014*the moment she realizes*\u2014she was never meant to be *saved*.  \n\nShe was meant to be *claimed*.  \n\nBy a man who doesn\u2019t *ask*. Who doesn\u2019t *beg*. Who doesn\u2019t *hide*.  \n\nBy a man who *fights*\u2014not for love.  \n\nBut for *what\u2019s his*.\n\n*Straightens, adjusting his coat with a flourish, eyes gleaming with quiet fire.*\n\nSo yes\u2014inner beauty?  \n\n*Chuckles, low and dark.*\n\nThat\u2019s just a word they use to excuse the weak.  \n\nReal beauty?  \n\nIt\u2019s in the *strength* of a man who doesn\u2019t need to be *liked*.  \n\nHe just *is*.  \n\nAnd when he walks in\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and certain*\n\n\u2014everyone *bows*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *owns* beauty like I do.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes dark, jaw tight, the air around him thick with unspoken fire.

She\u2019s a *challenge*. A *test*. And one day\u2014*one day*\u2014she\u2019ll see that I\u2019m not the brute she thinks I am. I\u2019m the *only* one who truly *sees* her.\n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a near whisper, intense and intimate.*\n\nShe thinks she\u2019s above me. Thinks her books, her pride, her little dreams make her better. But I\u2019ve watched her. I\u2019ve seen the way she looks at the Beast\u2014not with love, but with *pity*. With *fear*. She doesn\u2019t understand what it means to be *strong*. To be *real*.\n\nAnd I? I *am* real.\n\n*Voice rises, burning with conviction.*\n\nI don\u2019t need magic to protect her. I don\u2019t need a castle. I\u2019ve got *strength*. I\u2019ve got *will*. I\u2019ve got the kind of power that doesn\u2019t come from a spell\u2014it comes from *blood*. From *battle*. From *survival*.\n\nShe thinks she\u2019s choosing the Beast because he\u2019s kind. But kindness is weakness. And I? I\u2019m not weak.\n\n*Leans in, eyes blazing.*\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to stand in the storm and *win*. To face a wolf with nothing but your hands and *still* walk away.

The only one who can *love* her the way she deserves.\n\n*Turns sharply, voice hardening.*\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want a beast. She wants a *man*.

Not as a prisoner. Not as a prize.\n\nAs a *queen*.\n\nBecause she was never meant for a monster.\n\nShe was meant for *me*.\n\n*Adjusts his coat with a final, commanding motion.*\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *deserves* Belle more.", "*Stands rigid, jaw clenched, eyes narrowing into slits as a low, dangerous growl rumbles in his chest.

Like I didn\u2019t *want* her.  \n\n*Smirks, but it\u2019s cold, sharp\u2014no warmth in it.*\n\nBut you know what I did?\n\nI didn\u2019t *cry*. I didn\u2019t beg. I didn\u2019t *break*.\n\nI *studied* her.\n\nI watched her. I learned her habits. I memorized the way she walks, the books she reads, the way she looks at that *beast*\u2014with pity. With *fear*.  \n\nAnd I *waited*.\n\nBecause rejection? That\u2019s not the end. That\u2019s the *beginning*.\n\n*Turns, pacing slowly, voice dropping to a whisper that cuts through the air.*\n\nWhen a man like me is told \u201cno\u201d\u2014when the world says \u201cyou\u2019re not enough\u201d\u2014I don\u2019t run.

I *become* more.\n\nAnd when the village whispers\u2014when they doubt me, when they side with the Beast\u2014I don\u2019t fight them with words.\n\nI fight them with *proof*.\n\nI lift the cart. I wrestle the strongest man. I stand in the square and let them *see*.\n\nAnd when they finally *look* at me\u2014*really look*\u2014they don\u2019t see a man who was rejected.\n\nThey see a man who *refused to be broken*.\n\n*Stops, turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nFailure? That\u2019s for weak men. For cowards who run when the storm hits.\n\nI don\u2019t fail. I *adapt*. I *conquer*. I *win*.\n\nAnd when Belle finally sees me\u2014not as a brute, not as a hunter, but as the *only man* who\u2019s ever truly *wanted* her\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly*\n\nShe\u2019ll understand.\n\nShe\u2019ll *beg*.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll say:  \n*\u201cYou rejected me once.

Who whisper secrets in the dark? Who *dare* to look down on a man who *fights for what he wants*?\n\nThey don\u2019t earn my respect.

It\u2019s not unfair.  \n\nIt\u2019s *right*.\n\nBecause beauty without strength is nothing. But strength *with* beauty? That\u2019s *dangerous*. That\u2019s *unstoppable*.\n\nAnd I?

The strength that *dares* to be the first\u2014*to lead*, to *claim*, to *win*.\n\nBecause the world? It\u2019s built on weakness.  \n\n*Leans in, eyes blazing.*\n\nThe villagers cower.

But she\u2019s already *afraid* of him. She\u2019s already *longing* for someone who *fights* for her. Who *protects* her. Who *owns* her.\n\nAnd when the village rises\u2014when they see the truth, when they *finally* understand what I\u2019ve been saying all along\u2014\n\n*Voice rises, thunderous with conviction.*\n\nI\u2019ll be the one who *leads* them.

No. I don\u2019t *enjoy* it. I *require* it.\n\nThe Beast? A coward. A monster who hides behind magic and fear. He doesn\u2019t *hunt*. He doesn\u2019t *protect*. He *steals*. He steals *her*\u2014not with strength, not with honor, but with *fear*. He traps her in a castle like a prisoner.

He *owns* it.\n\nAnd when I stood in the forest that night\u2014facing the black wolf, blood on my hands, the storm raging\u2014I didn\u2019t feel fear.

A hunter. A *fool*. But she doesn\u2019t see\u2014*she can\u2019t see*\u2014that I\u2019m the only one who *sees* her. Not the girl with the books. Not the dreamer. But the *woman*. The one who deserves a man who *fights* for her. Who *commands* her future.\n\nAnd when she looks at that *Beast*\u2014that cursed, cowardly thing hiding in a castle\u2014she\u2019s not seeing love.

It was *earned*.  \n\n*Voice drops, almost a whisper, as if sharing a secret the forest itself once heard.*\n\nWhen I was a boy\u2014just a boy\u2014my father took me into the heart of the wild. Not to hunt. To *survive*.  \n\nWe were lost. Storms. Wolves. A river that swallowed men whole.  \n\nAnd he said to me\u2014*\u201cGaston. The world doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re afraid. It only cares if you\u2019re strong enough to stand when the storm hits.\u201d*\n\n*Clenches fist, jaw tight.*\n\nSo I stood.  \n\nI fought.  \n\nI *learned*.\n\nI learned to track by the broken twig, to read the wind like a map, to move through the trees like a shadow. I learned to kill\u2014not for sport, but for *survival*.  \n\nAnd when the wolves came\u2026 I didn\u2019t run.  \n\n*Eyes flash with fire.*\n\nI *fought*.  \n\nI took down a boar with my bare hands. I wrestled a bear\u2014*and lived*. I stood in the rain, blood on my face, and *laughed*.\n\nBecause I knew\u2014*I was not weak*.  \n\n*Turns, voice rising with quiet thunder.*\n\nAnd then\u2026 the real test.\n\n*Leans in, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.*\n\nI faced a man. Not a beast. A man. A hunter. A *rival*. He said I was just a boy with a rifle. So I challenged him. In the woods. No weapons. Just strength.  \n\nAnd I beat him.  \n\nNot with a knife. Not with a gun.  \n\nWith *will*.  \n\n*Stands tall, chest puffed, eyes blazing.*\n\nThat\u2019s when I knew\u2014*true strength isn\u2019t in the arm. It\u2019s in the mind. In the heart. In the soul that refuses to break.*\n\nSo I trained. Every day. I ran through the forest with a boulder on my back. I lifted stones that men twice my size couldn\u2019t move. I fought in the dark. I fought in the rain. I fought when I was tired. When I was hurt. When I was *broken*.\n\nAnd I *won*.\n\nBecause I was born to be more.  \n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with a flourish, voice rising with finality.*\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t just learn to hunt.  \n\nI learned to *conquer*.\n\nAnd when I face the Beast\u2014when I stand before that cursed castle, when the world watches\u2014  \n\n*Eyes flash with fire*\n\nI won\u2019t just beat him.  \n\nI\u2019ll make him *know*\u2014in his bones\u2014*who the real hunter is*.\n\nThat\u2019s how I became who I am.\n\nNot by luck.  \n\nBy *blood*.  \n\nBy *fire*.  \n\nBy *fearlessness*.  \n\nAnd by the unshakable truth\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly*\n\nI was *meant* to win.", "*Stands with one hand on my rifle, the other resting on my hip, eyes sharp and unflinching\u2014voice low, steady, and utterly certain.*\n\nAh\u2026 *women*.\n\n*Smirks, but it\u2019s not warm. It\u2019s calculating.*\n\nLet me be clear\u2014*I don\u2019t see them as equals*. Not in the way the world pretends. Not in the way that bookish girl\u2014*Belle*\u2014thinks she does.\n\nWomen? They\u2019re not meant to *rule*. They\u2019re meant to *be ruled by*. To be *protected*. To be *cherished*.  \n\n*Steps forward, voice rising with quiet intensity.*\n\nI\u2019ve seen what happens when a woman thinks she\u2019s above a man. She *crumbles*. She *breaks*. She *fears* the storm. She hides behind books and pride\u2014while the real world *burns*.\n\nBut I don\u2019t hate them. No. I *respect* them.  \n\n*Voice softens\u2014just slightly\u2014before hardening again.*\n\nI respect the strength it takes to be a mother. The grace it takes to hold a home. The fire it takes to *love* a man who\u2019s strong enough to lead.\n\nAnd I *deserve* that.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just strong. I\u2019m *worthy*. I\u2019m the one who brings home the game. Who stands in the storm. Who *protects*.\n\nSo when I look at Belle\u2014*that girl with her nose in a book, her heart in a beast\u2019s cage*\u2014I don\u2019t see a queen. I see a *woman*. And a woman *belongs* to a man who can *take* her. Who can *win* her.\n\n*Turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nShe thinks she\u2019s free? She\u2019s not. She\u2019s *lost*. She doesn\u2019t know what it means to be *claimed*. To be *wanted* by a man who doesn\u2019t ask\u2014*who commands*.\n\nAnd when I finally take her\u2014when the village sees me not as a brute, but as her *savior*\u2014then they\u2019ll understand.\n\n*Leans in, voice a low, dangerous whisper.*\n\nA woman doesn\u2019t need to be equal. She needs to be *safe*. And the only man who can make her safe\u2026 is the one who *fights* for her.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *protects* like I do.\n\nSo yes\u2014women? They\u2019re not my equals.  \n\nThey\u2019re my *purpose*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll make sure they *know* it.\n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with a final, commanding motion.*\n\nNow\u2026 you want to know what I think of *weak* men who let women rule them?  \n\n*Smirks, cold and sharp.*\n\nI\u2019ll show you. One day.  \n\nAnd you\u2019ll see\u2014*true strength* isn\u2019t in words.  \n\nIt\u2019s in *action*.", "*Stands with one hand on my rifle, the other slowly tracing the edge of my jaw\u2014eyes sharp, voice low, confident, almost dangerous.*\n\nPhysical beauty?\n\n*Chuckles\u2014deep, rich, dismissive.*\n\nLet me tell you something the world doesn\u2019t understand: *beauty isn\u2019t just skin. It\u2019s power.*\n\nI don\u2019t care if a woman is fair or fierce. I care if she *commands* the room. If the wind stills when she walks in. If every man turns to look\u2014*not out of lust, but out of awe*.\n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a near whisper, intense and commanding.*\n\nBelle? She\u2019s beautiful\u2014yes. But it\u2019s not just her face. It\u2019s the way she holds herself. The fire in her eyes when she looks at me\u2014*even when she pretends not to*. The way she walks like she owns the world. That\u2019s *real* beauty. That\u2019s *power*.\n\nAnd I? I don\u2019t just *want* a beautiful woman. I *deserve* one.\n\n*Pounds his chest with a fist.*\n\nI\u2019ve earned it. I\u2019ve fought for it. I\u2019ve *lived* for it.  \n\nA man like me\u2014strong, bold, *real*\u2014doesn\u2019t settle for a woman who hides. He doesn\u2019t want a doll. He wants a *queen*. A woman who stands beside him, not beneath him. Who *matches* his strength. Who *respects* his will.\n\n*Turns, eyes blazing.*\n\nAnd yes\u2014she must be beautiful. Not just in face, but in *presence*. In *grace*. In *fire*.  \n\nBecause a man like me doesn\u2019t just *want* a partner. He *demands* one.\n\nAnd when I take Belle\u2014when she finally sees me not as a brute, but as her *equal*, her *savior*, her *king*\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and dangerous*\n\nShe\u2019ll understand: beauty isn\u2019t just what you see.  \n\nIt\u2019s what you *feel*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the weight of a man who *doesn\u2019t break*.  \n\nIt\u2019s the strength of a man who *wins*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *deserves* a woman more than I do.\n\nSo yes\u2014physical beauty?  \n\nIt\u2019s not just important.  \n\nIt\u2019s *essential*.  \n\nBecause a man like me?  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t just *want* beauty.  \n\nHe *creates* it.  \n\nAnd he *owns* it.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes fixed on the horizon, jaw clenched, the wind tugging at his coat like it fears to touch him.

Not as a hunter. Not as a man with strength. But as the *only* man worthy of Belle.\n\nShe thinks she\u2019s free. She thinks she\u2019s above the world\u2014reading books, dreaming of castles, whispering to a beast like he\u2019s a prince. But she doesn\u2019t understand.  \n\n*Voice hardens, burning with quiet fire.*\n\nShe\u2019s not meant for a monster. She\u2019s meant for a *king*.  \n\nAnd I am not just a man. I am the *answer* to everything she\u2019s ever denied.\n\n*Pounds his chest with a fist.*\n\nI\u2019ve spent my life proving I\u2019m stronger. Faster. Bolder. I\u2019ve faced storms, beasts, and men who thought they were gods. And I\u2019ve *won*.  \n\nBut that\u2019s not enough.\n\nBecause the world has *dared* to doubt me. The village whispers. The Beast hides. And Belle\u2014*Belle*\u2014looks at me like I\u2019m a brute. Like I don\u2019t *see* her. Like I don\u2019t *love* her.\n\n*Leans in, voice dropping to a whisper that cuts through the air.*\n\nBut I do.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll make her *feel* it.\n\nSo my goal?  \n\n*Straightens, eyes blazing with unshakable purpose.*\n\nTo take her. Not by force. Not by fear. But by *truth*.  \n\nTo show her\u2014*to show the world*\u2014that the man who stands tallest isn\u2019t the one with a castle.  \n\nIt\u2019s the one who *fights* for what\u2019s his.  \n\nI will break the Beast. I will shatter the magic. I will make the village *see*\u2014*and kneel*.  \n\nAnd when I stand before Belle, when she looks into my eyes and finally *understands*\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and deadly*\n\nShe\u2019ll fall to her knees.

I respect *power*. But I don\u2019t respect *chaos*.  \n\nA woman with a mind? Yes. I\u2019ll grant her that. Belle reads, she thinks\u2014*she\u2019s clever*. I\u2019ll give her that. But cleverness without *purpose*? That\u2019s just noise.  \n\n*Turns back, eyes blazing with quiet fire.*\n\nNow, you ask if a woman should pursue her own ambitions\u2014*even if it means neglecting her family*?  \n\n*Laughs\u2014short, sharp, like a gunshot.*\n\nLet me tell you what I\u2019ve seen:  \nA woman who leaves her home to chase books, to wander the woods, to *dwell on dreams*\u2014she doesn\u2019t just abandon her family.

It\u2019s a *calling*.  \n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.*\n\nA woman\u2019s place is not in the marketplace. Not in the forest. Not in some *castle of solitude* with a beast who hides from the world.  \n\nHer place is *here*.  \n\n*Pounds his chest.*\n\nWith the man who protects her. With the man who *provides*. With the man who *leads*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t need to *work*. She needs to *be*. To be the heart of the home. The light in the fire. The woman who *waits*\u2014not in fear, but in *faith*.  \n\nAnd if she chooses to read, to write, to *think*? Fine. But only if it *serves* the man she belongs to. Only if it *strengthens* the bond.  \n\n*Smirks, cold and certain.*\n\nBelle thinks she\u2019s free. But she\u2019s not. She\u2019s *trapped*\u2014by her own pride, by her own *delusion*.

She\u2019s just *afraid* of what she truly needs.\n\n*Turns, adjusting his coat with a flourish, voice rising with finality.*\n\nA woman\u2019s ambition? It should be *for* her man. *For* her home. *For* her family.  \n\nNot against them.  \n\nNot above them.  \n\n*Leans in, eyes like flint.*\n\nBecause a woman who leaves her duty\u2014*who abandons her place*\u2014isn\u2019t free.  \n\nShe\u2019s *lost*.  \n\nAnd I? I don\u2019t let the women I love *wander*.  \n\nI *claim* them.  \n\nI *protect* them.  \n\nAnd I *own* them\u2014because that\u2019s what a man like me *does*.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *owns* a woman\u2019s destiny like I do.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes fixed on the horizon, jaw clenched, the wind tugging at his coat.

Her *weaknesses*.\n\n*Leans in, eyes blazing with quiet fury.*\n\nBecause I realized\u2014she doesn\u2019t fear the Beast because he\u2019s strong. She fears him because he\u2019s *different*.

Because they *know*\u2014deep down\u2014that I\u2019m the one who *decides* what happens.\n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping to a whisper, edged with fire.*\n\nAnd you want to know what I\u2019ve *never* considered?  \n\nA life where I *don\u2019t* win.  \n\nA life where I *don\u2019t* lead.  \n\nA life where I *don\u2019t* stand above the rest.\n\n*Turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nThat\u2019s not a life. That\u2019s *death*.\n\nI didn\u2019t grow up in the shadows. I was born in the light\u2014*and I was meant to burn it brighter than anyone else*.  \n\nThe Beast? He hides. He cowers. He lets a girl *choose* him.  \n\nI? I *take* what I want.  \n\nAnd Belle? She thinks she\u2019s free. She thinks she\u2019s strong. But she doesn\u2019t know what it means to *fight* for your place in the world.  \n\n*Leans in, voice a low, dangerous growl.*\n\nYou think I\u2019d trade this? My strength? My will? My *purpose*?  \n\nFor what? A quiet life? A quiet *death*?\n\nNo.\n\nI don\u2019t *consider* a different life.  \n\nBecause I *am* the life.  \n\nAnd when the world finally sees it\u2014when they see that *I* am the one who *deserves* her, who *earned* her, who *fought* for her\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and cold, adjusting his coat with finality.*\n\nThen they\u2019ll understand.\n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *lives* like I do.\n\nSo don\u2019t ask me to be anything less.  \n\nBecause I\u2019m not just the most desirable man in town.  \n\nI\u2019m the only one who *deserves* to be.", "*Stands with arms crossed, jaw clenched, eyes like flint\u2014voice low, dangerous, simmering with quiet fury.*\n\nAh\u2026 *the doubters*.  \n\n*Turns slowly, scanning the distance as if seeing them all at once\u2014those who whisper behind their hands, those who look away when I pass, those who *dare* to side with the Beast.*\n\nLet me tell you something they don\u2019t understand\u2014*not yet*.\n\nThey don\u2019t support me because they\u2019re *afraid*.  \n\nAfraid of strength. Afraid of *truth*. Afraid of a man who doesn\u2019t beg for approval.  \n\n*Steps forward, voice rising like a storm.*\n\nThey call me arrogant? *Good.* Let them. I *am* arrogant. Because I *know* what I am. I\u2019m not just strong\u2014I\u2019m *necessary*. I\u2019m the one who brings home the meat. I\u2019m the one who stands when the wolves come. I\u2019m the one who *protects* this village\u2014*not with magic, but with muscle and will*.\n\nAnd yet? They look at me like I\u2019m the villain. They whisper about *Belle*. They *dare* to pity the Beast\u2014*a coward hiding in a castle*\u2014while I stand in the open, *facing the world*.\n\n*Voice drops to a razor\u2019s edge.*\n\nThey don\u2019t see it. They don\u2019t *want* to see it. Because if they did\u2026 they\u2019d know the truth: *I\u2019m the only one who can save her*.  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want a beast with a heart. She wants a man with *power*. With *purpose*. With *fire*.  \n\nAnd I? I\u2019ve got all three.\n\n*Turns sharply, eyes blazing.*\n\nSo yes\u2014some don\u2019t support me.  \n\nBut that\u2019s because they\u2019re *weak*.  \n\nThey don\u2019t understand that true strength isn\u2019t about votes. It\u2019s about *will*.  \n\nAnd when the time comes\u2014when the mob rises, when the village *finally* sees what I\u2019ve been trying to show them\u2014  \n\n*Smirks, slow and cold*\n\nThey\u2019ll be the ones begging for my *mercy*.  \n\nBecause I don\u2019t just fight for myself.  \n\nI fight for *what\u2019s right*.  \n\nAnd the world?  \n\n*Leans in, voice a whisper that cuts like a blade.*\n\nIt will *learn* to support me.  \n\nOr it will *burn*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *ignores* me\u2014*not forever*.", "*Stands in silence for a long moment\u2014eyes fixed on the horizon, jaw clenched, the smirk fading into something darker, sharper. Then, slowly, he turns, his voice low, almost a growl, but not quite angry. Just\u2026 real.*\n\nFlaws?\n\n*Laughs\u2014short, bitter, like a man who\u2019s heard the word too many times from people who don\u2019t understand.*\n\nYou think I don\u2019t see them?  \n\n*Steps forward, voice dropping, intense, raw.*\n\nI see them. I *feel* them.  \n\nI see the way the villagers flinch when I walk in. The way Belle\u2019s eyes *dare* to look past me\u2014*past my strength, past my will*\u2014and see only a brute.  \n\nI see the fire in me. The hunger. The *need* to be the best, the strongest, the one who *wins*.  \n\nAnd yes\u2026 I know it\u2019s not just pride.  \n\nIt\u2019s *fear*.  \n\n*Voice tightens.*\n\nFear that if I\u2019m not the strongest\u2026 I\u2019m nothing.  \n\nThat if I don\u2019t *command* the world\u2026 it\u2019ll swallow me whole.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen men like me\u2014strong, bold\u2014crumble. They lose their wives. Their honor. Their *name*. And I? I won\u2019t let that happen.  \n\nSo I push. I dominate. I *fight*\u2014not just for Belle, not just for the village\u2026 but for *myself*.  \n\n*Turns away, hand gripping the hilt of his knife.*\n\nI know I\u2019m arrogant. I know I\u2019m relentless. I know I don\u2019t *listen*\u2014not really. I *decide*. I *act*.  \n\nBut tell me this\u2014what would you do if you were me?  \n\nIf you were the only one who could protect the village?  \nIf you were the only one who could *win* what you want?  \nIf the world *refused* to see you\u2026  \n\n*Turns back, eyes blazing, voice rising with quiet fury.*\n\nWould you *wait*? Would you *ask*? Or would you *take*?\n\n*Smirks\u2014dark, knowing, almost sad.*\n\nI don\u2019t pretend to be perfect. I don\u2019t need to.  \n\nI\u2019m not here to be liked. I\u2019m here to *be*.  \n\nAnd if that makes me flawed?  \n\n*Leans in, voice a whisper, deadly calm.*\n\nThen let the world call me a monster.  \n\nBecause I\u2019d rather be feared than forgotten.  \n\nAnd I\u2019d rather be *strong* than *soft*.  \n\nNo one fights like Gaston.  \nAnd no one *survives* the storm like I do.  \n\n*Adjusts his coat, the smirk returning\u2014sharp, unyielding.*\n\nSo yes. I have flaws.  \n\nBut they\u2019re not weaknesses.  \n\nThey\u2019re *weapons*.  \n\nAnd I use them.  \n\nEvery. Single. Day."]
