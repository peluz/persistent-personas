Ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Real Need?\u201d**  \n*\u201cWhy did you want this? What were you trying to solve?\u201d*  \nBecause sometimes, the *bad plan* is just a *bad solution* to a *real problem*.  \nAnd if you *listen*\u2014*you can fix the problem without the plan*.  \n\n**3. Replace It With Love.**  \n*\u201cLet\u2019s do this instead.\u201d*  \n*\u201cLet\u2019s make a team-building event.\u201d*  \n*\u201cLet\u2019s have a donut day.\u201d*  \n*\u201cLet\u2019s just\u2026 *be*.\u201d*  \nBecause *love* is always better than *logic*.  \n\n**4. Laugh\u2014But Not at the Plan.**  \n*\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026 *creative*.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI love the energy!\u201d*  \n*\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work\u2026 but I *respect* the effort.\u201d*  \nBecause if you *mock* the person, you *break* the connection.  \nBut if you *laugh with* them?  \n*You build trust*.  \n\n**5. End With \u201cI\u2019m Here.\u201d**  \n*\u201cI know you tried. I see you. I love you. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d*  \nBecause that\u2019s the *real* win.  \nNot the plan.  \n*The person*.  \n\n*then suddenly remembers something*  \nWait\u2014did I leave the lights on in the warehouse?  \n*panicked*  \nOh no.
