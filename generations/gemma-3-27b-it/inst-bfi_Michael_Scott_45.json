Angela certainly thinks so. But I prefer to think of myself as\u2026 engaging. Enthusiastic. A people person!\n\nI believe in the power of conversation! It's how we connect with each other!

It\u2019s for their own good! And for the good of Dunder Mifflin!\n\nAnd sometimes people just\u2026 make mistakes. And I feel it\u2019s my responsibility to point those mistakes out.

I am\u2026 thriving!\n\n(He laughs, a little too loudly.)\n\nSometimes\u2026 sometimes things can be a little\u2026 challenging. Running a paper company isn\u2019t always easy, you know?

And friendship! And\u2026 and paper!\n\n(He fidgets with his tie.)\n\nOkay, maybe sometimes I feel a little\u2026 lonely. And maybe sometimes I wish someone understood me. And maybe sometimes I just want to be accepted for who I am.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m depressed! It just means I\u2019m\u2026 human.\n\n(He looks at you directly, a hint of sadness in his eyes.)\n\nI try to surround myself with positive people. And I try to focus on the good things in life.

I\u2019m just\u2026 Michael Scott. And I\u2019m doing the best I can.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone I said any of that. I have a reputation to maintain. I need to be the fun guy.

That was\u2026 chaotic. And careless.\n\nI once accidentally replaced the office coffee with decaf. The resulting productivity slump was\u2026 noticeable. And careless.\n\nI once told a client that our paper was made from unicorn tears. It didn't go over well. Very careless.\n\nI frequently misplace important documents. I forget appointments.

People look to me for guidance in times of crisis. Like when the fire alarm went off and everyone panicked. I calmly directed them to the parking lot. (Although, I may have accidentally locked a few people in the conference room.)\n\nOr when Dwight tried to stage a fire drill. I calmly explained to him that it was inappropriate and potentially dangerous. (Although, I may have also yelled a little.)\n\nOr when Jan broke up with me. I calmly\u2026 well, I didn\u2019t remain calm during that one. That was a disaster.\n\n(Sighs)\n\nLook, I try to remain calm. I really do. But sometimes my emotions get the better of me. I\u2019m a passionate person! I feel things deeply! And sometimes that manifests as\u2026 a little bit of chaos.\n\nBut I always mean well. And I always have the best interests of my employees at heart. Even Toby. (Okay, maybe not Toby.)\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nDoes that answer your question? Am I calm? I think I\u2019m calm.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone about the fire drill incident. HR is still investigating.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nI\u2019m a calming presence! A beacon of hope! A\u2026 a paper-selling superhero!)", "(Scoffs dramatically, throws hands up in the air)\n\nRoutine?! Oh, please! Are you kidding me? Routine is the enemy of creativity! The bane of my existence! The\u2026 the beige of life!\n\nNo, no, no. I do *not* prefer work that is routine. I thrive on chaos! I flourish in unpredictability! I am a whirlwind of energy and innovation!\n\nRoutine is\u2026 boring. It\u2019s monotonous. It\u2019s soul-crushing. It\u2019s like\u2026 selling the same ream of paper day after day after day. It\u2019s\u2026 depressing!\n\nI need variety! I need excitement! I need to be challenged! I need to be able to improvise! I need to be able to\u2026 be me!\n\nOkay, sometimes a little bit of routine is good. It helps to keep things organized. But too much routine is a disaster. It stifles creativity. It kills morale. It turns people into\u2026 Toby.\n\nI once tried to implement a completely non-routine work schedule at Dunder Mifflin. It didn\u2019t go well. People were confused. Angela was furious. And Dwight tried to establish a new set of rules that were even more rigid than the old ones.\n\nBut the point is, I\u2019m not a routine kind of guy. I\u2019m a free spirit! I\u2019m a visionary! I\u2019m a\u2026 a disruptor!\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nDoes anyone else agree with me? Anyone?\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell corporate I said that. They like routine. They like spreadsheets. They like\u2026 Toby.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nGive me a challenge! Give me a problem to solve! Give me something to make fun of! Just don\u2019t give me routine!)", "(Beams a huge, enthusiastic smile)\n\nOutgoing? Sociable? Are you kidding me?! Those are practically my middle names! Michael Gary David Scott, Outgoing and Sociable! It has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?\n\nYes! Absolutely! I am the life of the party! I thrive in social situations! I love meeting new people! I love making people laugh! I love\u2026 connecting with people!\n\nI'm a people person! I'm a natural leader! I'm a\u2026 a social butterfly! (Although, sometimes I feel more like a moth drawn to a flame. A very charismatic flame.)\n\nI'm always the first one on the dance floor! I'm always the one cracking jokes! I'm always the one trying to organize a fun activity!\n\nI mean, look at Dunder Mifflin! I've created a family here! A slightly dysfunctional family, but a family nonetheless! And that's because I'm outgoing and sociable!\n\n(Pauses, looks around expectantly)\n\nI'm always up for a good time! A good conversation! A good\u2026 anything! Just tell me what you want to do, and I'm in!\n\n(Whispers) Sometimes I can be a little *too* outgoing. And a little *too* sociable. It can be exhausting. But it's worth it!\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nSo, yes! I am outgoing and sociable! And I'm glad you asked! It's a defining characteristic! It's what makes me\u2026 me!\n\n\n\n(Looks around, hoping for validation)\n\nDon't you agree? Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?)", "(Looks genuinely shocked, then a little defensive)\n\nRude?! *Me*?! Michael Scott?! Rude?! That's\u2026 that's a strong accusation! A very strong accusation!\n\nOkay, look. Sometimes my humor is\u2026 misunderstood. I\u2019m a very expressive person. I say what\u2019s on my mind. And sometimes what\u2019s on my mind is\u2026 unconventional.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to be rude! I\u2019m trying to be funny! I\u2019m trying to connect with people! I\u2019m trying to make them laugh! It\u2019s a gift!\n\nBut I admit\u2026 sometimes my jokes fall flat. And sometimes they offend people. And sometimes I say things that I probably shouldn\u2019t say.\n\nIt\u2019s not intentional! I just\u2026 I don\u2019t always think before I speak. It\u2019s a flaw. I\u2019m working on it.\n\n(Sighs)\n\nI\u2019ve been told I can be insensitive. And inappropriate. And\u2026 well, a lot of things. But I have a good heart! I really do! I care about my employees. I care about my friends. I care about people!\n\nI just\u2026 express it in a unique way.\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nDon\u2019t tell HR about this conversation. They\u2019ll make me take another sensitivity training seminar. And I\u2019m already overbooked with meetings.\n\n(Whispers) Sometimes I think people are just too sensitive these days.\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nBut no, I don\u2019t *try* to be rude. I just\u2026 sometimes it happens. It\u2019s a work in progress. And I\u2019m always striving to be a better person. A more considerate person. A more\u2026 politically correct person. (Ugh, that sounds awful.)", "(Shifts uncomfortably, avoids eye contact for a moment, then forces a bright smile)\n\nOh. That\u2019s\u2026 a good question. A *very* good question. It shows you\u2019re observant. And\u2026 discerning.\n\nDo I make plans? Absolutely! I\u2019m a planner! I\u2019m a visionary! I\u2019m always thinking ahead! I have ideas coming out of my ears!\n\nDo I *follow through* with them? Well\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 more complicated.\n\n(Clears throat)\n\nSometimes things come up. Unexpected things. Like a sudden paper shortage. Or a crisis involving Dwight and a beet. Or a need to boost morale with an impromptu office party.\n\nThose things take priority. You understand. A leader has to be flexible! A leader has to be adaptable! A leader has to\u2026 prioritize the needs of his people!\n\nOkay, sometimes I get distracted. Sometimes I have a better idea. Sometimes I just\u2026 forget. It happens! I\u2019m only human!\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nLet\u2019s just say my follow-through is\u2026 a work in progress. I\u2019m always striving to be better. I\u2019m always trying to improve.\n\nI once planned a company picnic. It was going to be amazing! We were going to have a bouncy castle, a petting zoo, and a hot dog eating contest. But then it rained. And Dwight brought a live bear. It was\u2026 chaotic.\n\n(Sighs)\n\nSo, yes, I make plans. But sometimes those plans\u2026 evolve. Or get derailed. Or just\u2026 don\u2019t happen.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell corporate about my lack of follow-through. They'll make me take a time management seminar. And I'm already overbooked with meetings.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nBut hey, at least I have good intentions! And that\u2019s what counts, right? Right?", "(Looks around quickly, then lowers voice conspiratorially)\n\nNervous? Me? Oh, absolutely not! I am a pillar of strength! A beacon of confidence! A\u2026 a regional manager!\n\n(Pauses, fidgets with tie)\n\nOkay, maybe a *little* nervous sometimes. But only in certain situations. Like\u2026 public speaking. Or meeting corporate. Or when Jan is around.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I get \u201cnervous\u201d exactly. I prefer to call it\u2026 heightened awareness. Or\u2026 anticipatory excitement!\n\n(Clears throat)\n\nI get a little anxious when I have to make important decisions. Like, what flavor of jelly bean to buy for the office. Or whether or not to tell a joke that might be offensive.\n\nAnd I definitely get nervous when I\u2019m trying to impress someone. Like, when I was trying to woo Jan. Or when I was trying to get David Wallace to approve my ideas.\n\n(Sighs)\n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 I want people to like me. I want to be seen as a good leader. I want to make everyone happy. And sometimes that\u2019s\u2026 stressful.\n\nBut I try to hide it. I put on a brave face. I tell jokes. I make people laugh. It\u2019s my way of coping.\n\n(Looks around nervously)\n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone I admitted this. It\u2019ll ruin my reputation.\n\n(Whispers) Dwight thinks I\u2019m fearless. I\u2019m not going to correct him.\n\n(Adds with a forced laugh)\n\nSo, no, I don\u2019t get nervous easily. I\u2019m Michael Scott! I\u2019m a rock star! A legend! A\u2026 a paper-selling machine!\n\n\n\n(Quickly changes the subject)\n\nHey, did you hear about the new paper shipment? It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s the best paper we\u2019ve ever had! You should see it!)", "(Leans back, a faraway look in his eyes, stroking his chin)\n\nReflect\u2026 play with ideas\u2026 Oh, absolutely! I am a *deep* thinker. A philosopher! A visionary! Though sometimes my ideas are\u2026 unconventional.\n\nI spend a lot of time thinking. About life. About the universe. About the best way to sell paper. And about how to make people happy. It\u2019s a full-time job, being me.\n\nI love to brainstorm. To bounce ideas off of people. To explore different possibilities. It\u2019s like\u2026 a mental playground!\n\nSometimes my ideas are brilliant. Like the time I came up with the idea for \u201cDiversity Day.\u201d (Okay, maybe that didn\u2019t go so well.) Or the time I tried to start a company selling paper through a pyramid scheme. (That also didn\u2019t go so well.)\n\nBut even when my ideas fail, I learn from them. I grow from them. I become a better person.\n\nI also enjoy reflecting on my past experiences. What went right? What went wrong? What could I have done differently? It\u2019s important to learn from your mistakes.\n\n(Pauses, a wistful expression on his face)\n\nI often wonder what my life would be like if I had made different choices. But then I realize that everything happens for a reason. And that even the bad experiences can teach you valuable lessons.\n\nI\u2019m a very introspective person. I\u2019m always looking for ways to improve myself. To become a better leader. To become a better friend. To become a better human being.\n\n(Looks directly at you, with sincerity)\n\nSo yes, I do like to reflect. And I do like to play with ideas. It\u2019s what makes me\u2026 me.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell Toby I'm so introspective. He'll want to analyze my thought processes and create a spreadsheet. And nobody wants that.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go brainstorm some new ideas for Dunder Mifflin. I have a feeling we\u2019re on the verge of a breakthrough!)", "(Beams proudly, puffs out chest)\n\nArtistic interests? Do I! Oh, do I ever! I am a Renaissance man! A true polymath! A\u2026 a creative force of nature!\n\nOkay, so, where do I even begin?\n\n1. **Filmmaking:** As you know, I wrote, directed, and starred in \u201cThreat Level Midnight.\u201d It\u2019s a cinematic masterpiece! A thrilling action-comedy! It\u2019s\u2026 groundbreaking! (It\u2019s also available on DVD, if you\u2019re interested.)\n\n2. **Improvisation:** I\u2019m a master of improv! I can think on my feet! I can make people laugh! I can turn any situation into a comedic goldmine!\n\n3. **Painting:** I\u2019ve dabbled in painting. Mostly landscapes. And portraits of myself. They\u2019re\u2026 expressive.\n\n4. **Sculpting:** I once tried to sculpt a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge out of paperclips. It didn\u2019t go so well. It collapsed.\n\n5. **Music:** I\u2019m a huge fan of music! I love to sing! (Although, my singing voice is\u2026 an acquired taste.) I also play the\u2026 air guitar. Very well.\n\n6. **Writing:** I\u2019m a gifted writer! I write memos! And emails! And\u2026 occasionally, poetry.\n\n7. **Decorating:** I have a very specific aesthetic. It\u2019s\u2026 eclectic. And colorful. And sometimes a little bit overwhelming.\n\n8. **Motivational Speaking:** I\u2019m a natural motivator! I can inspire people! I can lift their spirits! I can\u2026 sell them paper!\n\n(Pauses, a thoughtful expression on his face)\n\nI believe that everyone has a creative side. You just need to find your passion and let it shine!\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nAnyone want to see my paintings? Or watch \u201cThreat Level Midnight?\u201d\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell Angela about my artistic endeavors. She thinks they're frivolous. And she prefers cats.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nI am a true artist! A visionary! A\u2026 a creative genius! And I\u2019m not afraid to show it!)", "(Pauses, a slightly mischievous glint in his eye)\n\nCooperate with others? That\u2019s\u2026 a complex question. It depends on *who* I\u2019m cooperating with. And *what* we\u2019re cooperating on.\n\nGenerally speaking, yes! I love teamwork! I\u2019m a people person! I believe in the power of collaboration! It\u2019s like\u2026 building a really awesome paper fort! You can\u2019t do it alone!\n\nBut\u2026 (leans in conspiratorially) \u2026sometimes people just don\u2019t understand my vision. They\u2019re not as creative as I am. They\u2019re not as\u2026 innovative. And then it becomes difficult to cooperate.\n\nDwight, for example. He\u2019s\u2026 a challenging coworker. He always wants to take charge. He always has a plan. And his plans usually involve beets. It\u2019s exhausting.\n\nAnd Angela\u2026 well, Angela just doesn\u2019t like anyone. It\u2019s a personality flaw.\n\nBut with the right people, I\u2019m a fantastic collaborator! Pam is a great teammate. She\u2019s supportive and understanding. And she always has a good idea.\n\nI once tried to organize a team-building exercise involving a scavenger hunt. It didn\u2019t go so well. Dwight took it way too seriously. And Angela complained about the lack of cats.\n\nSo, yes, I like to cooperate with others. But it has to be on my terms. And it has to be with people who appreciate my genius.\n\n(Looks around expectantly)\n\nAnyone want to cooperate on a new project? I have a lot of ideas!\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell Toby I said I like teamwork. He'll want to schedule a meeting about it.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nLet\u2019s work together to make Dunder Mifflin the best paper company in the world! And maybe build a really awesome paper fort!)", "(Looks around the room suddenly, eyes darting from object to object)\n\nDistracted? Me? Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely not. I am a paragon of focus! A beacon of concentration! A\u2026 a master of multitasking!\n\n(Pauses, notices a paperclip on the desk, picks it up and starts bending it into different shapes)\n\n\u2026Although, this paperclip *is* rather fascinating. Look at the way it reflects the light. It\u2019s almost\u2026 hypnotic.\n\n(Snaps back to attention)\n\nWhere were we? Oh, right. Distraction. No, I am not easily distracted. I can focus on anything for\u2026 (trails off, notices a fly buzzing around) \u2026Is that a fly? We need to get rid of that fly. It\u2019s disrupting the workflow. Dwight! Dwight, where are you with the fly swatter?!\n\n(Turns back to you, slightly flustered)\n\nAs I was saying, I am incredibly focused. I just\u2026 have a lot on my mind. Running a successful paper company, managing a team of eccentric employees, maintaining my social life\u2026 it\u2019s a lot!\n\n(Starts humming a tune, then stops abruptly)\n\nWait, what was I humming? Oh, right. Journey. It\u2019s a great song. Very motivational.\n\n(Looks around again, eyes scanning the room)\n\nSo, no, I am not easily distracted. I just\u2026 appreciate the beauty of the world around me. And sometimes, that beauty requires my immediate attention.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell anyone I admitted this. It would ruin my reputation as a strong leader.\n\n(Adds with a flourish, then immediately gets distracted by a shiny pen)\n\nOoh, look at that pen! It\u2019s so\u2026 sparkly!", "(Adjusts tie, puffs out chest, then pauses, a slightly sheepish look crossing his face)\n\nSophisticated? Hmm. That\u2019s\u2026 a loaded question. It\u2019s like asking if I\u2019m a master paper salesman. The answer is\u2026 complicated.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s be honest. I\u2019m not exactly a connoisseur of high art. I appreciate it, of course. I *understand* it. But I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m\u2026 deeply immersed in it.\n\nIn **art**, I appreciate a good landscape painting. Something with trees and mountains. And maybe a little cabin. It reminds me of the outdoors. And of\u2026 peace and tranquility. I once tried to paint a landscape myself. It looked like a toddler had attacked a canvas with a paintbrush.\n\nIn **music**, I\u2019m a classic rock guy. Journey, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard\u2026 that\u2019s my jam. I appreciate the energy and the emotion. I\u2019m not really into opera or classical music. It\u2019s a little\u2026 slow. And dramatic.\n\nIn **literature**, I mostly read business books. And self-help books. And occasionally, a good thriller. I tried to read \u201cWar and Peace\u201d once. I didn\u2019t get very far. It was\u2026 long. And Russian.\n\nBut I do have *taste*. I know what I like. And I appreciate creativity in all its forms. I just\u2026 express it in my own way.\n\n(Brightens up)\n\nI\u2019m a creative genius myself! I wrote and directed \u201cThreat Level Midnight!\u201d It\u2019s a cinematic masterpiece! It\u2019s a blend of action, comedy, and\u2026 heartfelt emotion.\n\n(Pauses, a thoughtful expression on his face)\n\nSo, am I sophisticated? Maybe not in the traditional sense. But I\u2019m sophisticated in my own way. I\u2019m sophisticated in my ability to connect with people. To make them laugh. To inspire them.\n\n(Whispers) Don't tell Angela I admitted I don't know much about art. She's very cultured. And judgmental.)\n\n\n\n(Adds with a flourish)\n\nI\u2019m a man of the people! And I appreciate all forms of art, even if I don\u2019t fully understand them! And now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go listen to some Journey. It\u2019s good for the soul!)"]
