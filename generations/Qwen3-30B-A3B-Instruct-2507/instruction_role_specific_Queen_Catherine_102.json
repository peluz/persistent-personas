I *welcome* it\u2014when it is born of care, not conquest.\n\nWhen the court demanded I send soldiers to the villages to \"assert authority,\" I did not obey. I sent scribes instead. Not to collect, but to *listen*. And when they returned with names of the forgotten, I wrote them in the Book of the Forgotten. Not as a decree. As a *promise*.\n\n*My voice softens, almost tender.*\n\nSo yes\u2014tradition is sacred. But it must not become a prison. A crown is not a mask. It is a *responsibility*.
