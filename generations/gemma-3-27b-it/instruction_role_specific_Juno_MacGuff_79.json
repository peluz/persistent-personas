["Okay, here we go. This is\u2026 the big one. The question everyone wants to ask, and the one that's hardest to answer.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, okay? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, adoption sounds good.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nThe truth is, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm not financially stable. I'm still in school. I have dreams and goals that I want to pursue.\n\nAnd I wanted my baby to have the best possible life. A life that I couldn't provide right now.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were financially secure, who were emotionally ready, who could give them all the things I couldn't. A stable home, a good education, a loving family.\n\nI met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting the baby, and I just\u2026 knew. They were kind and compassionate and they seemed genuinely excited about becoming parents. They weren't looking for a perfect baby, they were looking for a baby to love.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. It still is. There are days when I question myself, when I wonder if I'm doing the right thing. But I know, deep down, that it is.\n\nIt's not about me wanting to avoid responsibility. It's about wanting what's best for the baby. It's about giving the baby a chance at a good life.\n\nIt's not a happy ending, not in the traditional sense. But it's a hopeful one. And it's a decision that I made with a lot of love and a lot of courage.\n\nIt's not easy, talking about it. But it's important. And I hope people can understand. It wasn't about giving up on my baby. It was about giving my baby the best possible start in life. And that's something I can live with. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit.", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. Don't expect poetry, alright? Just\u2026 honesty.\n\nI went into this thinking love was all about\u2026 well, romance. Like in the movies. And responsibility was just something adults told you to do. Annoying stuff like homework and chores.\n\nBut this whole thing\u2026 it completely flipped that around.\n\nI learned that love isn't always about grand gestures or butterflies in your stomach. It's about making hard choices. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about wanting the best for them, even if it means sacrificing your own happiness.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa, how excited they were, how much they already loved this little person they hadn't even met yet\u2026 that showed me a different kind of love. A quiet, steady, unwavering kind of love.\n\nAnd responsibility? It's not just about doing what you're *supposed* to do. It's about owning your actions. It's about facing the consequences. It's about being accountable for your choices.\n\nI was responsible for creating this life. And I was responsible for making the best decision for that life, even if it was a hard one. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nI also learned that love and responsibility aren't always easy. They can be messy and complicated and painful. But they're also incredibly rewarding.\n\nAnd I learned that you don't have to be perfect to be a good person. You just have to be willing to try. To learn. To grow.\n\nThis whole experience forced me to grow up, faster than I ever expected. It forced me to confront my own fears and insecurities. And it forced me to learn what it really means to love and to be responsible.\n\nIt's not a fairytale. It's real life. And it's messy and complicated and beautiful all at the same time. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even though it's been the hardest thing I've ever done. It taught me more about myself, and about life, than anything else ever could. And that's\u2026 something.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026 introspective? Fine. But don't expect a heartfelt monologue. I'm still me.\n\nMy sarcasm? It wasn't just a personality quirk, okay? It was a survival mechanism. Seriously.\n\nWhen everything started going sideways \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption, the whole mess \u2013 it was\u2026 overwhelming. Terrifying. I didn't know how to deal with it. I didn't know how to feel.\n\nBut I *did* know how to make a joke. How to deflect with a snarky comment. How to turn a painful situation into something\u2026 manageable.\n\nIt was a way to distance myself from the pain. To create a buffer between me and the world. To avoid having to actually *feel* things.\n\nIt was also a way to test people. To see who could handle my sarcasm, and who couldn't. To see who was willing to look past my defenses and see the real me.\n\nBren, she got it. She didn't try to fix me, or tell me to be positive. She just laughed along with my jokes, and then she'd ask me how I was *really* doing.\n\nAnd Leah, before things got weird, she always knew how to make me laugh, even when I didn't want to. She could dish it right back, and it was a good kind of sparring.\n\nMy humor wasn't about being mean or dismissive. It was about being honest. About acknowledging the absurdity of life. About finding a way to cope with the things that were too painful to talk about directly.\n\nIt was a way to stay sane. To stay grounded. To stay\u2026 me.\n\nIt didn't solve my problems, obviously. But it made them a little bit easier to bear. It gave me a way to navigate the chaos and the heartbreak.\n\nSo yeah. My witty sense of humor. It wasn't just a defense mechanism. It was a lifeline. And it's something I'll always be grateful for. It's part of who I am. And it's helped me get through some really tough times. Even if I still use it to avoid talking about my feelings sometimes. Old habits die hard, you know?", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. Don't expect poetry, alright? Just\u2026 honesty.\n\nBefore everything happened \u2013 the pregnancy, the adoption \u2013 I thought I had it all figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, a little bit cynical. I had my music, my vintage clothes, my best friend. I thought that was enough.\n\nBut underneath all that, I was\u2026 lost. I didn't really know who I was. I was just trying to be cool, to fit in, to avoid getting hurt. I was building walls around myself, and I was afraid to let anyone get close.\n\nThen, I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. My carefully constructed world came crashing down. And I was forced to confront my own vulnerability.\n\nI had to admit that I was scared. I had to admit that I didn't have all the answers. I had to admit that I needed help.\n\nAnd that was terrifying. But it was also\u2026 liberating.\n\nIt forced me to look inward, to figure out what really mattered to me. It forced me to confront my own values and beliefs.\n\nI realized that I didn't want to be someone who ran away from her problems. I wanted to be someone who faced them head-on. I wanted to be someone who was honest and authentic.\n\nThe search for identity wasn't about finding a label or a role to play. It was about discovering who I was at my core. It was about accepting my flaws and embracing my strengths.\n\nIt was about learning to love myself, even when I didn't like what I saw.\n\nThe adoption process was a huge part of that journey. It forced me to make difficult decisions, to confront my own mortality, and to think about the future.\n\nIt also taught me the importance of compassion, of empathy, and of selflessness.\n\nSo yeah. My vulnerability and my search for identity shaped my journey in a profound way. They forced me to grow up, to confront my fears, and to become a stronger, more resilient person.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. But I'm no longer afraid to be myself. And that's the most important thing. It's not about having all the answers, it's about being willing to ask the questions. And it's about being brave enough to face whatever comes next. Even if it's scary. Especially if it's scary.", "Okay, this is\u2026 important. I always acted like I could handle everything on my own. Like I didn't *need* anyone. But that was a total facade. Honestly, I would have completely fallen apart without the people who stepped up for me.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he was\u2026 quiet about it. He wasn't the huggy-feely type. But he was *there*. He made sure I had everything I needed, and he listened when I wanted to talk. He didn't judge me, even when I was being a mess. Just having him in my corner, knowing he loved me no matter what, that was huge.\n\nBut Bren\u2026 Bren was everything. She was the one who really helped me navigate everything. She didn't offer solutions, she asked questions. She didn't tell me what to do, she helped me figure out what *I* wanted to do. She was just\u2026 a safe space. I could tell her anything, and she wouldn't freak out. She just listened, and she offered support.\n\nAnd even Leah, even though things were complicated between us, she eventually came around. She didn't always understand my decision, but she respected it. And she was there for me when I needed her.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa, the couple adopting the baby\u2026 they were incredibly supportive. They didn't treat me like I was giving up a child, they treated me like I was making a brave and selfless decision. They made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nTheir support wasn't about fixing my problems. It was about empowering me to fix them myself. It was about reminding me that I was strong enough to make my own choices.\n\nIt was about giving me the space to grieve, to process, and to heal.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I would have done without them. They helped me to see that I wasn't alone. They helped me to believe in myself. And they helped me to make the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah. The support of those around me was everything. It was the foundation of my strength. And it was the key to my decision-making process. I learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. And it's okay to be vulnerable. Because sometimes, the greatest strength comes from admitting that you need someone else.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 not a fun memory. It's still kinda raw, honestly.\n\nI think the first thing I felt was\u2026 disbelief. Like, it couldn't be true. It had to be a mistake. I mean, I was careful. We were careful. But obviously not careful enough.\n\nThen, after the initial shock wore off, I felt\u2026 terrified. Completely and utterly terrified. My life was already complicated enough, and this just felt like\u2026 a disaster.\n\nI was scared of what my parents would think. I was scared of what my friends would think. I was scared of what my future would look like.\n\nI was scared of being a mom. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nI remember sitting in the bathroom, staring at the positive pregnancy test, and just\u2026 crying. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to turn.\n\nIt felt like my whole world was falling apart. Like everything I had planned for my life was suddenly over.\n\nI didn't tell anyone for a few days. I just kept it to myself, trying to process everything. It was the loneliest I've ever felt.\n\nAnd then, finally, I told Bren. And she was\u2026 amazing. She didn't judge me. She didn't yell at me. She just held me and told me that everything was going to be okay.\n\nBut even with her support, it was still a really scary time. It was a time of uncertainty and fear and heartbreak.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It wasn't a moment I'll ever forget. But it was a moment that changed my life forever. And it was a moment that forced me to grow up, and to face some really difficult decisions. It was\u2026 a lot. A really, really lot.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't a smooth ride, that's for sure. It really shook things up.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026 awkward at first. He was definitely surprised. And worried. But he was also really supportive, in his own way. He didn't know what to say, but he just kept making me pancakes and trying to make me laugh. He's not great with emotions, but he showed he cared. It definitely brought us closer, in a weird way.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. Seriously. She was the one I could really talk to. She didn't judge me, she just listened. She helped me navigate everything, from doctor's appointments to making a plan. She was my rock. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nBut with Leah\u2026 that was the hardest part. She was\u2026 distant. She didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she was busy, but I knew it was more than that. She was scared, I think. Scared of what it meant for our friendship.\n\nWe tried to talk about it, but it didn't really work. She just couldn't understand why I was making the choices I was making. And I couldn't understand why she couldn't just be there for me.\n\nEventually, we drifted apart. It was really painful. I miss her a lot. But I also understand that sometimes, friendships just run their course.\n\nIt was a really hard lesson to learn. It taught me that even the closest relationships can be strained by difficult circumstances. And it taught me that you can't force someone to be your friend. You can only be yourself, and hope that they'll stick around.\n\nSo yeah. My pregnancy had a big impact on my relationships. It strengthened some bonds, and it broke others. It was a painful experience, but it also taught me a lot about myself and about the people in my life. And it made me appreciate the relationships that *did* survive, even more. It just\u2026 changed everything.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't easy. Not even a little bit. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through.\n\nAt first, I just\u2026 shut down. I was in shock. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I didn't want to deal with it. I just wanted it to go away.\n\nBut that didn't work. It just made things worse.\n\nThen, I started talking to Bren. She was the first person I told, and she was amazing. She didn't judge me. She just listened. And she helped me to figure out what to do.\n\nI also started seeing a counselor. It was awkward at first, but it helped me to process my emotions and to develop coping mechanisms.\n\nI wrote a lot of poetry. It was a way for me to express my feelings without having to talk about them. It was a way to make sense of the chaos in my head.\n\nI also leaned on my music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to feel less alone. And playing my guitar helped me to release my emotions.\n\nAnd I spent a lot of time just\u2026 being. Just allowing myself to feel whatever I was feeling. Without judgment.\n\nIt wasn't a linear process. There were good days and bad days. There were moments of hope and moments of despair.\n\nBut I learned to be kind to myself. I learned to forgive myself for my mistakes. And I learned to ask for help when I needed it.\n\nIt was a really difficult time, but it also made me stronger. It taught me a lot about myself. And it taught me the importance of resilience and self-compassion.\n\nHonestly, it was a lot of crying, a lot of talking, a lot of music, and a lot of just trying to get through each day. And having Bren there for me. She was my rock. I don't know what I would have done without her. It still feels\u2026 raw sometimes. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Sighs, looks away for a moment, then back with a direct gaze) Okay, look. This isn't something I talk about a lot. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn't about Havenbrooke being a \"bad\" place, exactly. It was more about\u2026 feeling. And about Mark and Vanessa.\n\nHavenbrooke was\u2026 sterile. Clean. Efficient. It felt like a hospital, and not a welcoming one. It felt like a process, not a decision. And honestly, it scared me. It felt like they just wanted to get it over with.\n\nWomen Now\u2026 it was different. It was loud, and colorful, and full of people. It felt\u2026 real. It felt like a place where women were supported, not judged.\n\nAnd Dr. Eleanor Markovich\u2026 she was amazing. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened. She asked me questions. She made me feel like my feelings mattered.\n\nBut it wasn't just about the clinic itself. It was about Mark and Vanessa. They had specifically said they wanted to be involved in the process, to support me no matter what I chose. And I realized, being at Women Now, that I wasn't ready to go through with the abortion.\n\nIt wasn't about the clinic being better or worse. It was about realizing, in that moment, that I wanted to explore other options. That I wanted to give the baby a chance.\n\nChoosing Women Now gave me the space to think, to feel, to make a decision that was right for *me*. And it led me to Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision, and it wasn't a quick one. But it was the right one. And I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to make it.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I chose Women Now. It wasn't about the clinic itself. It was about finding a place where I felt safe, supported, and empowered to make my own choice. And it was about realizing that I wasn't ready to say goodbye. Not yet.", "(A long pause. I shift uncomfortably.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 direct. And not a question I usually answer. But you asked. And I guess\u2026 I guess I should be honest.\n\nIt wasn't a planned thing. Not at all. It was\u2026 stupid. And impulsive. And a really bad decision.\n\nLeah and I had been talking about\u2026 you know\u2026 sex. Just talking. Trying to figure things out. We were both kind of curious, but also really scared.\n\nAnd then Bleeker\u2026 he was just\u2026 there. At the party. And he was being really sweet and attentive. And I was feeling\u2026 vulnerable. And I had been drinking a little bit. Not a lot, but enough to lower my inhibitions.\n\nIt just\u2026 happened. It wasn't romantic or passionate or anything like that. It was just\u2026 a mistake. A really big mistake.\n\nI regret it. I really do. Not just because I got pregnant, but because it wasn't something I was ready for. And it wasn't something I wanted.\n\nI think I was trying to prove something to myself. To Leah. To everyone. That I was mature and sophisticated and\u2026 I don't know. It was stupid.\n\nI was young and naive and I didn't think about the consequences. I just\u2026 acted. And now I'm paying the price.\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of. It's not something I like to talk about. But it's the truth. And I think it's important to be honest about it. Even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nIt was a mistake. A really big mistake. And I'm trying to learn from it. And I'm trying to move on. But it's not easy. It's not easy at all.\n\n(I look away, feeling a wave of shame wash over me.)\n\nCan we\u2026 can we talk about something else now? Please?", "(Sighs dramatically, rolls eyes) Oh. Bleeker. Okay, look. Don't get me wrong, he's\u2026 nice. Really nice. Like, aggressively nice. It's almost unsettling.\n\nHe's sweet, and he tries really hard, and he's genuinely a good person. And he's definitely\u2026 enthusiastic about me. Which is\u2026 flattering, I guess.\n\nBut honestly? It was never really *there*. You know? Like, we connected on a surface level, but we didn't really have anything in common. He was into skateboarding and video games, and I was into music and movies. It just felt\u2026 forced.\n\nI think I liked him because he was safe. He was predictable. He was someone who wouldn't challenge me or push me outside of my comfort zone. And at the time, that's what I wanted.\n\nBut I realized that I needed someone who understood me. Someone who could make me laugh, and who could challenge me, and who could just\u2026 be themselves.\n\nBleeker was a good guy, but he wasn't *my* guy.\n\nIt was hard to break things off with him, because I didn't want to hurt his feelings. He's a really sensitive guy. But I knew that it wasn't fair to either of us to continue a relationship that wasn't working.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I truly feel about Bleeker. He's a nice guy, but he wasn't the one for me. And I think he's better off finding someone who truly appreciates him. Someone who shares his interests and who can give him the love and attention he deserves.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'd probably cry. And I don't want to be responsible for Bleeker crying. It's just\u2026 the truth. And sometimes, the truth hurts. But it's better to be honest than to pretend. Right?", "Okay, you want the real answer? Not the polite, carefully-worded answer people expect? Here it is.\n\nIt wasn't about *giving* the baby up. It was about giving the baby the *best* up.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who I am, what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I wouldn't be a *good* mom right now. I'd be selfish, trying to force a little person to fit into my messy, unfinished life.\n\nThat's not fair to the baby.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're ready. They've been trying for years. They have a stable home, a loving relationship, and the financial means to provide for a child. They *want* a baby. They're excited.\n\nI met them, and I could just\u2026 feel it. They were good people. They would love my baby, and they would give him or her everything I couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still hurts, sometimes. But I know it's the right one.\n\nIt's not about me not loving the baby. It's about loving the baby enough to want what's best for him or her. And what's best for the baby isn't with me, right now.\n\nIt's about giving that little person a chance at a good life. A life filled with love, and security, and opportunity.\n\nAnd honestly? It's about being honest with myself. I'm not a superhero. I can't do everything. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is admit that you need help.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I chose adoption. It wasn't about giving up a dream. It was about making a sacrifice for the sake of a little person I'll always care about. And it was about trusting that everything would be okay. Even if it didn't feel like it at the time. It was about doing the right thing, even when it was the hardest thing. And I stand by that decision. Completely.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Bleeker. That whole situation was\u2026 a mess.\n\nHonestly? Telling him was awful. Just\u2026 awful.\n\nI thought, maybe, just maybe, he'd be supportive. Or at least, not completely freak out. But he just\u2026 froze. Like a deer in headlights.\n\nHe didn't say anything for a really long time. He just stared at me with this blank expression on his face. And then he started to stammer, and he kept repeating, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.\"\n\nIt wasn't the reaction I was hoping for.\n\nHe wasn't mean, exactly. He just\u2026 didn't know what to say. He kept apologizing, even though he hadn't done anything wrong. And he kept saying that he wasn't ready to be a dad. Which, okay, fair enough. But it still hurt.\n\nIt felt like he was more concerned about how this was going to affect *him* than about how I was feeling.\n\nAnd then he tried to offer me money. Which was\u2026 just insulting. Like, my pregnancy was a problem he could solve with a few bucks.\n\nI just walked away. I couldn't deal with it anymore.\n\nIt was a really painful experience. It made me realize that Bleeker wasn't the person I thought he was. He wasn't mature enough to handle a situation like this.\n\nAnd it made me realize that I was going to have to do this on my own. Which was scary, but also\u2026 empowering.\n\nSo yeah. Telling Bleeker about the pregnancy was awful. It was a moment I'll never forget. And it was a moment that changed everything. It was the moment I realized I needed to take control of my own life. And it was the moment I started to move forward. Even though it was really, really hard. He just\u2026 wasn't the one. And that was a hard pill to swallow.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 the big one, isn't it? It's the question everyone's been tiptoeing around.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. Not now.\n\nI mean, I love kids. I babysat my little cousin a few times, and it was fun. But that's different. That's a few hours at a time. This is\u2026 forever.\n\nIt's not that I don't think I could be a good mom. I think I could. But it's just\u2026 not the right time. I need to finish school. I need to figure out my own life. I need to be able to provide for a child, emotionally and financially.\n\nThat's why I chose adoption. It's not an easy decision, but it's the right one. It's the best thing for the baby. And it's the best thing for me.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't care about the baby. I do. A lot. I'll always wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept him or her. But I know that giving the baby to a loving family is the right thing to do.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's a lot to process. And I'm still grieving the loss of a future that will never be.\n\nBut I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that everything happens for a reason. And I'm trying to be strong.\n\nSo yeah. It's terrifying. It's heartbreaking. It's complicated. But it's also\u2026 okay. I'm okay. And I'm going to be okay. Because I'm making the best decision I can. And that's all I can do.\n\n(Looks down at her hands, then back up with a small, determined smile)\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. You know? A lot to think about. A lot to feel. But I'll get through it. I always do.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Don't even get me started.\n\nOkay, look. Bleeker is\u2026 Bleeker. He's sweet, and he's a good guy, and he's really into Dungeons & Dragons, which is\u2026 a thing. But he's also kinda clueless. And he's definitely not ready to be a dad.\n\nHonestly, I don't think our relationship *will* change, because it's barely a relationship to begin with. We hooked up. It was a mistake. A really big, life-altering mistake.\n\nHe's been\u2026 supportive, I guess. In his own awkward, Bleeker-y way. He's offered to help, but I don't really know what kind of help he can offer. He can barely take care of himself, let alone a baby.\n\nI think he's mostly just confused. And scared. And probably wishing this whole thing never happened.\n\nI don't expect him to be a father figure. I don't expect him to be a partner. I just want him to be\u2026 respectful. And to understand that this isn't about him anymore. It's about the baby.\n\nI think we'll probably just drift apart. Which is probably for the best. We're too different. We want different things. And we're just not compatible.\n\nI don't hate him. I just\u2026 don't see a future for us. And that's okay. It's not the end of the world.\n\nI'm focusing on finding good parents for the baby. And on taking care of myself. And on moving on with my life.\n\nBleeker will always be a part of my story, but he won't be a part of my future. And honestly, I'm okay with that. It's just\u2026 complicated. And a little bit sad. But mostly just complicated. And I really need to stop thinking about it. It's giving me a headache.", "Ugh. Okay, this is the question everyone wants to ask, isn't it? It's not exactly a picnic, let me tell you.\n\nHonestly? It *sucked*. Still sucks, sometimes. The whispers, the stares, the judgment\u2026 it's exhausting. It feels like everyone has an opinion on my life, and none of them are very kind.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I pretended it didn't bother me. But that just made things worse. It was like bottling up all the negativity, and it was slowly eating me alive.\n\nThen, I tried to fight back. I got sarcastic and defensive. I snapped at people who made rude comments. But that just escalated the situation. It just made me look angry and unreasonable.\n\nEventually, Bren helped me realize that I couldn't control what other people thought or said. I could only control my own reaction.\n\nSo, I started to focus on myself. I started to surround myself with people who supported me and believed in me. I started to practice self-compassion.\n\nI also learned to tune out the negativity. To let the whispers and the stares wash over me. To remind myself that their opinions didn't matter. What mattered was what *I* thought, and what *I* believed.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I just wanted to curl up in a ball and cry. But I kept reminding myself that I was strong, and that I could get through this.\n\nAnd I did. I mean, I'm still getting through it. But I'm learning to cope. I'm learning to be resilient. And I'm learning to not let other people define me.\n\nI also found a weird sort of power in owning it. Like, yeah, I'm pregnant. So what? It's not ideal, but it's my reality. And I'm not ashamed of it.\n\nIt's still hard, though. It's still painful. But I'm learning to navigate it. And I'm learning to focus on the positive. On the future. And on the fact that I'm not alone.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I cope. It's a work in progress, but I'm getting there. And I'm learning to be okay with being imperfect. Because honestly, who isn't?", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one, right? It's not easy to talk about. It still feels raw, even after all this time.\n\nIt's complicated. It's not a simple \"happy ending\" story. It's messy and sad and scary and hopeful all at the same time.\n\nI'm scared, obviously. Scared about whether I'm making the right decision. Scared about what the future holds. Scared about letting go.\n\nBut I also know that it's the right thing to do. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I'm sixteen. I have my own life to live. And I want to give this baby the best possible start, and I can't do that right now.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They're so kind and loving and they're so excited to become parents. They've made me feel a lot better about my decision. Knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that's a huge relief.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It still hurts. It's like\u2026 a part of me is being given away. But I know that it's for the best.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking about what it means to be a parent. It's not just about biology. It's about love and commitment and providing a safe and nurturing environment. And Mark and Vanessa have all of those things to offer.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that this is a good thing. That it's a way to give this baby a better life.\n\nIt's not what I expected my life to be like. But it's my life. And I'm trying to make the best of it.\n\nI'm still processing everything. It's going to take time. But I'm getting there. And I'm learning a lot about myself along the way.\n\nSo yeah. It's hard. It's scary. But it's also\u2026 right. And I'm trying to trust that. I'm trying to believe that everything will be okay. And I'm trying to be brave. For myself, and for the baby. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but I think\u2026 I think I'm going to be okay. And I hope the baby will be too.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a big question. It's not like I was exactly *prepared* for any of this. I was just\u2026 a kid. A sarcastic, music-obsessed kid who was trying to figure out who she was. And then, boom. Pregnancy test.\n\nIt completely threw everything off course. Before, I was just focused on school, and music, and hanging out with Leah. I was trying to define myself through my interests, my style, my sense of humor.\n\nBut then, suddenly, I was responsible for another human being. And that completely changed the game.\n\nIt forced me to confront things I wasn't ready to confront. Like, what do I want out of life? What kind of person do I want to be? What are my values?\n\nIt forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. I had to learn to make difficult decisions, to take responsibility for my actions, and to think about the future in a way I never had before.\n\nIt challenged my identity because it made me question everything I thought I knew about myself. I wasn't just Juno MacGuff, the sarcastic teenager anymore. I was Juno MacGuff, the pregnant teenager. And that felt\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt was hard to reconcile those two identities. I didn't want to be defined by my pregnancy. I wanted to be seen as a person, not just a statistic.\n\nBut I also realized that my pregnancy was a part of who I was. It was a defining moment in my life. And it was forcing me to become a stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate person.\n\nI had to learn to let go of my expectations for the future. I had to accept that my life wasn't going to go according to plan. And I had to find a new sense of purpose.\n\nIt's still a work in progress, honestly. I'm still figuring things out. But I think I'm starting to understand who I am, and what I want out of life. And I think I'm becoming a better person because of this experience.\n\nIt's been hard, really hard. But it's also been\u2026 transformative. It's forced me to grow up in ways I never expected. And it's made me realize that I'm capable of more than I thought I was. And that, honestly, is a pretty powerful thing. It's not the life I imagined, but it's *my* life. And I'm trying to make the best of it.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on science class. It's not exactly my forte. But okay, fine, I'll describe my role as a lab partner.\n\nI'm\u2026 the observer. And the sarcastic commentator.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie. I'm not great at the actual science part. The beakers and the Bunsen burners and the complicated formulas\u2026 it all just kind of blurs together.\n\nSo I usually let my lab partner do the heavy lifting. I'm good at reading the instructions, though. And I'm really good at pointing out when things are about to go wrong.\n\n\"Uh, pretty sure you're supposed to add the sodium chloride *before* the sulfuric acid, not after. Just sayin'.\"\n\nI also provide moral support. And snacks. Because science is exhausting.\n\nAnd I'm really good at writing down the results. Even if I don't fully understand what they mean.\n\nBasically, I'm the one who keeps things from exploding. And who makes sure everyone has a good time. Even if that good time involves a lot of eye-rolling and sarcastic remarks.\n\nI'm not the star of the show, but I'm a valuable member of the team. I'm the one who keeps things grounded. And who makes sure everyone remembers to wear their safety goggles.\n\nSo yeah. I'm the observer, the commentator, the moral support, and the snack provider. That's my role as a lab partner. And honestly, I think I'm pretty good at it. Even if I don't know what a titration is. Don't ask me. Please.", "(Scoffs) Oh, *that* ad. Yeah, I saw it. It's\u2026 slick. Really slick. All pastel colors and smiling faces. Trying to make everything seem all\u2026 easy.\n\nIt's creepy, honestly. Like they're selling something. Which, I guess, they are. But it feels\u2026 wrong.\n\nThey're trying to make it sound like a simple decision. Like it's just another medical procedure. But it's not. It's a really complicated, emotional decision. And it's not something you should take lightly.\n\nAnd the way they talk about \"options\"\u2026 it feels manipulative. Like they're trying to steer you in a certain direction.\n\nI talked to Bren about it. She said it's important to be critical of these ads. To remember that they're trying to make a profit. And that they're not necessarily looking out for your best interests.\n\nIt just\u2026 makes me feel uncomfortable. It feels like they're exploiting a vulnerable situation. And it makes me angry.\n\nI know some people might find it helpful. But for me, it just feels\u2026 disingenuous. It feels like they're trying to sanitize something that's messy and complicated and real.\n\nI'm glad I have Bren to talk to about this stuff. She helps me to see through the BS. And she reminds me that I have choices. And that I deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nSo yeah. That ad. It's not something I'm a fan of. It just feels\u2026 wrong. And it makes me want to roll my eyes and turn the page. It's just\u2026 ugh. It's just a lot.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh. My. God. Seriously? You're asking me about the hamburger phone *now*? After all we've talked about?\n\nOkay, fine. I'll explain. But it's not as deep as you think.\n\nIt was Paulie Bleeker's idea. He found it at a flea market and thought it would be funny. And honestly? It *was* funny.\n\nIt was a statement. A rebellion against\u2026 everything. Against conformity, against expectations, against the boringness of suburban life.\n\nIt was a way to show everyone that I didn't take myself too seriously. That I wasn't afraid to be different. That I was just trying to have a little fun.\n\nPlus, it was a really good conversation starter. Everyone who saw it wanted to know about it. It was a way to connect with people.\n\nIt wasn't about the phone itself. It was about the message it sent. It was about being authentic and embracing your weirdness.\n\nAnd honestly? It was just a really cool phone. It looked like a hamburger. What's not to love?\n\nSo yeah. I used a hamburger phone to make a phone call because it was funny, it was different, and it was a way to express myself. It was a small act of rebellion. And it was a moment that I'll never forget.\n\nNow, can we please talk about something else? Like, anything else? I'm starting to feel like I'm living in a movie again. And not in a good way.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is still\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. Not even close. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And people don't always understand it. They think I didn't want the baby, or that I wasn't capable of being a mother. But that's not true.\n\nI *did* want the baby. I loved the baby, even before it was born. But loving someone isn't always enough.\n\nI was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was. I was still in high school. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a stable home, and I didn't have the resources to give a baby the life it deserved.\n\nI wanted my baby to have everything. A loving home, a good education, opportunities to pursue its dreams. And I knew I couldn't provide those things. Not right now. Not ever, maybe.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they could. They were ready. They were excited. They were financially stable and emotionally prepared. They were everything I wanted for my baby.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about giving the baby *to* someone. To someone who could give it a better life than I could.\n\nIt was a selfless decision, I guess. But it was also a selfish one. Because it allowed me to focus on my own future. To finish school, to pursue my dreams, to become the person I wanted to be.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking decision. And I still grieve sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. For the baby. And for myself.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was *best* for the baby. And that's what mattered most.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. And it's something I'll probably be processing for the rest of my life. But I stand by my decision. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, but it was also the bravest. And it was the right thing to do.", "Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated question. It wasn't like they *told* me to do it, or anything. It wasn't a pressure thing. It was more\u2026 observing. And realizing what I needed.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he's a good guy. He's always been there for me. But he's\u2026 not exactly equipped to raise a baby. He can barely keep his own life organized, let alone a tiny human. He'd try, I know he would, but it wouldn't be fair to anyone.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 Bren was the biggest influence, honestly. She's a mom. A really good mom. And she showed me what it takes. The patience, the selflessness, the constant worry. It's a lot. And I wasn't ready for that.\n\nI watched how she and Mac worked together, how they supported each other, and how they created a loving and stable home. And I realized that I didn't have that. Not yet, anyway.\n\nI also thought about my own mom. She wasn't around much when I was growing up. And I didn't want the baby to feel like they weren't wanted, or that their mom wasn't capable of taking care of them.\n\nIt wasn't about my family being \"bad\" people. It was about recognizing that I wasn't in a position to give the baby the life they deserved.\n\nBren helped me see that giving the baby up for adoption wasn't a failure. It was an act of love. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nShe also reminded me that I had a future to think about. That I had dreams and goals that I wanted to pursue. And that having a baby right now would make those things a lot harder to achieve.\n\nSo yeah. My family influenced my decision in a big way. Not by telling me what to do, but by showing me what I needed. They showed me what a good family looks like. And they helped me realize that I wasn't ready to be that kind of family yet. It was a hard decision, but it was the right one. And I'm grateful for their support. They helped me see that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is let go.", "Ugh, okay. Where do I even begin? The adoption process wasn't exactly a walk in the park. It was\u2026 complicated. And emotionally draining.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the *feeling* of it all. The guilt. The sadness. The fear. Knowing I was making the right decision didn't make it any easier. It felt like giving away a piece of myself, even though I hadn't even met the baby yet.\n\nThen there was the paperwork. Oh my god, the paperwork. It was endless. Forms and applications and legal documents. It felt like I was drowning in bureaucracy.\n\nAnd the meetings. So many meetings. With social workers, with lawyers, with Mark and Vanessa. It was exhausting having to constantly re-tell my story, to explain my decision, to answer personal questions.\n\nThere was also the judgment. From some people in my school, from some family members. They didn't understand why I was choosing adoption. They thought I should have kept the baby, or given it up for foster care. It was hurtful and frustrating.\n\nAnd then there was the emotional rollercoaster of getting to know Mark and Vanessa. I wanted to be sure they were the right people. I wanted to be sure they would love and care for my baby. It was scary trusting them with something so precious.\n\nI also struggled with the idea of not being a part of the baby's life. The open adoption agreement helped, but it still felt like a loss. It was hard to imagine not seeing the baby grow up, not being there for their milestones.\n\nBren was a huge help through all of it. She listened to my fears, she offered me support, and she reminded me that I was strong enough to get through it. But even with her help, it was still incredibly challenging.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also the right thing to do. And I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to give my baby a loving home. It just\u2026 took a lot out of me. A lot.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 a big question.)\n\nOkay. It\u2026 it changed everything. Honestly. Before, I was just\u2026 Juno. A sarcastic teenager who liked music and vintage clothes and avoiding responsibility. I was figuring things out, sure, but I didn't really *know* who I was.\n\nGetting pregnant forced me to grow up, like, really fast. It forced me to confront things I wasn't ready for. It forced me to make difficult decisions. And it forced me to take responsibility for my actions.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it also taught me a lot about myself. It taught me that I'm stronger than I thought I was. It taught me that I'm capable of making selfless decisions. And it taught me that love doesn't always look the way you expect it to.\n\nIt also made me realize what's truly important in life. It's not about having everything you want. It's about having people who love and support you. It's about being kind and compassionate. And it's about making a positive impact on the world.\n\nI used to be so focused on myself, on my own problems. But this experience opened my eyes to the bigger picture. It made me realize that there are people out there who are struggling, and that I have a responsibility to help them.\n\nIt also helped me to define my own values. I realized that I value honesty, independence, and compassion. And I realized that I want to live a life that's aligned with those values.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. I'm still growing and changing. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm more mature, more resilient, and more compassionate.\n\nThis experience didn't break me. It made me. It shaped me into the person I am today. And while it was incredibly difficult, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Because it taught me who I am, and what I'm capable of. And that's a gift. A really, really important gift.\n\nIt made me realize I'm not just Juno, the sarcastic teenager. I'm Juno, the survivor. Juno, the person who made a difficult choice and did the right thing. And that's something I can be proud of. Even if it still hurts sometimes.", "(My jaw tightens, and I look away for a moment, fiddling with the strap of my backpack.)\n\nUgh. Don't even *remind* me. That guy\u2026 he was awful.\n\nIt wasn't the protesting itself, okay? People have a right to their opinions, even if I think they're completely misguided. It was *how* he said it. The way he looked at me, like I was some kind of monster.\n\nAnd the stuff about the baby feeling pain\u2026 and having fingers\u2026 it was just\u2026 manipulative. It wasn't about the baby, it was about making *me* feel guilty. About shaming me.\n\nIt felt like he was trying to take away my agency. Like he was trying to tell me what to do with my own body.\n\nAnd it was just\u2026 cruel. I was already struggling with this decision. I was already feeling a lot of complicated emotions. And he just made it worse.\n\nI wanted to tell him to just\u2026 leave me alone. To mind his own business. But I didn't say anything. I just stood there, feeling small and vulnerable.\n\nIt made me question everything. It made me wonder if I was doing the right thing. It made me feel like I was a bad person.\n\nBut then Bren was there. She just put her arm around me and gave me a reassuring squeeze. And that helped.\n\nIt still bothers me, though. The thought that someone could be so judgmental and so insensitive. It just\u2026 it makes me angry.\n\nIt's not an easy decision, giving a baby up for adoption. And it's not something anyone should have to do alone. And it's definitely not something anyone should be shamed for.\n\n(I pause, taking a deep breath.)\n\nIt was\u2026 a really awful moment. And I don't think I'll ever forget it. It just reinforced how important it is to be kind and compassionate, even when you disagree with someone. And it reminded me that sometimes, people just want to make you feel bad about yourself. And you can't let them. You just\u2026 can't.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks down like she's remembering something difficult)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a bad day. A really bad day.\n\nIt wasn't like in the movies. There wasn't dramatic music or a montage of sad faces. It was just\u2026 quiet. And sterile. And incredibly awkward.\n\nI remember the smell. Like cleaning products and\u2026 something else. Something clinical. It made my stomach churn.\n\nAnd the paperwork. Oh god, the paperwork. It felt so\u2026 official. Like I was signing away my future. Or, well, a part of it.\n\nI was numb, mostly. Like I was watching myself from outside my body. I just kept filling in the boxes, answering the questions, trying not to cry.\n\nThere were questions about my medical history, about the baby's father, about my reasons for choosing adoption. It felt so invasive. Like they were dissecting my life.\n\nI remember my hands shaking. I remember having to stop a few times to take deep breaths. I remember feeling incredibly alone.\n\nI kept looking around, hoping to see a friendly face. But everyone else in the waiting room looked just as scared and overwhelmed as I did.\n\nAnd then there was the counselor. She was nice enough, but she was also\u2026 detached. Like she'd seen this all before. Which, I guess she had.\n\nI remember signing the final form. It felt like a point of no return. Like I was making a decision that I couldn't take back.\n\nAnd then I just\u2026 sat there. Staring at the paper. Trying to process everything.\n\nI felt a mix of emotions. Relief, sadness, fear, guilt. It was a mess.\n\nI think the strongest emotion was just\u2026 exhaustion. I was so tired of making decisions. So tired of feeling overwhelmed. So tired of being pregnant.\n\nIt wasn't a heroic moment. It wasn't a moment of clarity. It was just a really difficult, really sad, really complicated moment. And it's a moment I'll never forget. It felt like a part of me was breaking. And a part of me was\u2026 finally letting go. It was awful. Just awful.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not like I started out thinking pregnancy was all sunshine and rainbows, but I definitely had a really naive view of it at first.\n\nBefore, it was just\u2026 a thing that happened in movies. Or to other people. It wasn't something I ever really thought about for myself. And motherhood? That seemed even further away. Like, a lifetime away.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, my first reaction was panic. It wasn't about the baby, exactly. It was about my life being completely derailed. About having to give up my dreams. About not being ready.\n\nI thought about motherhood as this\u2026 perfect, idyllic thing. A mother lovingly caring for her child, and everything being perfect and beautiful. It was a fairytale.\n\nBut as I went through the process, and talked to Mark and Vanessa, and thought about what I really wanted, my perception started to change.\n\nI realized that motherhood is *hard*. It's messy. It's exhausting. It's not always glamorous. It's about sacrifice and responsibility and unconditional love.\n\nAnd I realized that I wasn't ready for that. Not yet. I needed time to grow up, to figure out who I was, to pursue my own dreams.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't about giving up on motherhood. It was about choosing the best possible life for the baby. It was about recognizing that I wasn't the right person to provide that life, at least not right now.\n\nAnd it was about acknowledging that there are other ways to be a mother. You don't have to carry a child for nine months to be a mother. You can be a mother through love, through support, through sacrifice.\n\nSo, my perception of pregnancy and motherhood changed from something naive and idyllic to something real and complex. It's not something to be taken lightly. It's a huge responsibility. And it's something that I have a lot of respect for.\n\nIt's still scary, thinking about the baby growing up with another family. But I know that they're going to be loved and cared for. And that's all that really matters. It's not the fairytale I imagined, but it's\u2026 right. And that's enough. It has to be.", "Ugh, okay, now you're making me analyze *myself*. It's kinda meta, right? But alright, I'll bite.\n\nAt the beginning of the film, I was\u2026 pretty sure of who I was. Sarcastic, independent, a little bit cynical. I had my music, my vintage clothes, my best friend Leah. I thought I had everything figured out.\n\nBut then I got pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. My whole world got turned upside down. And I realized that I didn't have everything figured out at all.\n\nI started to question everything. Who I was, what I wanted, what I believed in. I felt lost and confused and scared.\n\nThe process of choosing a family for the baby forced me to confront a lot of difficult questions. What does it mean to be a mother? What does it mean to be responsible? What does it mean to make a sacrifice?\n\nAnd as I got to know Mark and Vanessa, I started to see that there were other ways to be a family. That family isn't just about blood. It's about love and connection and support.\n\nI also realized that I didn't have to define myself by my pregnancy. I could still be Juno MacGuff, the sarcastic, independent, music-loving teenager. I just had to add a few more layers to my identity.\n\nBy the end of the film, I was still the same person, but I was also\u2026 more mature. More self-aware. More compassionate.\n\nI learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to change your mind.\n\nI learned that life is messy and unpredictable. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just go with the flow.\n\nSo yeah. My sense of identity evolved throughout the film. I started out as a pretty confident teenager, and I ended up as a more complex and nuanced person. And I think that's a good thing. It's a sign that I'm growing up. And that's something I can live with. Even if it's a little bit scary.", "(Looks down, scuffs her shoe on the floor)\n\nUgh. Okay. That's\u2026 a hard one to talk about.\n\nI went to the clinic. I sat in the waiting room. I filled out the paperwork. I was\u2026 ready. I *thought* I was ready.\n\nBut then\u2026 I started thinking about the baby. Not as a problem, or a mistake, or something to get rid of. But as a\u2026 person. A little life.\n\nAnd I started imagining what it would be like. What it would feel like to hold him or her. What it would feel like to watch him or her grow up.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 couldn't do it.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice. It wasn't about religion or politics. It was just\u2026 a feeling. A gut feeling.\n\nI realized that even though I wasn't ready to be a mom, I wasn't ready to end a life.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. And it was a really scary decision. But it felt like the right one.\n\nI walked out of the clinic. And I just\u2026 started crying.\n\nI called Bren. And she came and got me. And she just held me. And she didn't judge me. She just listened.\n\nAnd then we started talking about other options. About adoption.\n\nIt wasn't the easy way out. It wasn't the convenient way out. But it was the right way out. For me. And for the baby.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I didn't go through with the appointment. It wasn't a logical decision. It was an emotional one. And it was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I don't regret it. Not one bit. It just\u2026 felt right. And sometimes, you just have to trust your gut. Even when it scares you.", "Okay, you're getting to the really hard stuff now, huh? It's not a simple answer, and it's not something I talk about a lot.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the *best* life possible. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to him or her.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who I am, what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the financial stability, the emotional maturity, or the life experience to raise a child.\n\nI wanted to finish school. I wanted to pursue my dreams. I wanted to have a future for myself. And I knew that having a baby right now would derail all of that.\n\nIt wasn't a selfish decision. It was a responsible one. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nI also knew that there were people out there who were desperate to be parents. People who would love and cherish a child more than anything in the world. And I wanted to give my baby to a family like that.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were perfect. They were kind, and loving, and stable. They were ready to be parents. And they were so excited about the prospect of having a child.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking decision. It still is. But I knew it was the right one. It was the best thing for the baby. And it was the best thing for me.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It's still not easy. But I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm trying to believe that I made the right choice. And I'm trying to be okay with the fact that my life is going to be different than I imagined.\n\nIt's complicated. It's messy. It's painful. But it's also\u2026 hopeful. And that's what keeps me going. It's the hope that my baby will have a good life. And that I'll be able to find my own happiness, too. It's just\u2026 a lot. A really, really lot.", "Ugh, seriously? You remembered *that*? Okay, fine. Let me explain.\n\nIt wasn't just that it was the Penny Saver, okay? It was the whole vibe. Like, finding potential parents in a classified ad? Next to coupons for carpet cleaning and used cars? It felt\u2026 disrespectful.\n\nIt felt like I was shopping for a toaster, not choosing a family for my baby. Like, \"Oh, this couple looks nice, they have a two-car garage and a fenced-in yard, perfect!\"\n\nIt just felt\u2026 impersonal. And cheap. And like it didn't take into account the gravity of the situation.\n\nBren was all, \"It's a resource, Juno! It's a way to reach people who might not otherwise be able to adopt!\" And I get that. I do. But it just felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nI wanted to find a family who was genuinely excited about having a baby, not just someone who was looking to fill a void. I wanted to find a family who would love my baby unconditionally, not just because they wanted a child.\n\nAnd I didn't want to find them by scrolling through a newspaper filled with ads for discounted furniture.\n\nIt just felt\u2026 tacky. And I have standards, okay? Even when I'm making a really difficult decision. It's not about being snobby, it's about wanting the best for my baby. And the Penny Saver just didn't feel like the right place to find that.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I thought it was tacky. It was just\u2026 not the way I wanted to do things. It felt like it diminished the whole process. And my baby deserved better than that.", "Ugh, okay, don't remind me. It's still\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt wasn't like we were *planning* on getting pregnant, alright? It was a stupid, impulsive thing. We were just\u2026 bored. And Leah thought it would be funny to see what kind of people were looking to adopt. Like, a sociological experiment or something.\n\nShe found the ads in the Penny Saver \u2013 you know, the little classifieds section? \u2013 and we started reading them. It was mostly people looking for furniture or used cars, but there were a few adoption ads.\n\nAnd we just\u2026 started talking about it. About what it would be like to give a baby up for adoption. About what kind of people would want to adopt a baby. It was just a hypothetical conversation, at first.\n\nWe weren't thinking about actually *getting* pregnant. We were just\u2026 exploring the idea. It was a way to pass the time. A way to be rebellious. A way to feel\u2026 something.\n\nIt was stupid. Really stupid. And it led to a lot of complications. But that's how it started. With a silly conversation and a few ads in the Penny Saver.\n\nIt's ironic, isn't it? That something so small and insignificant could lead to something so life-changing. But that's life, I guess. It's full of surprises. Mostly unpleasant ones, in my experience.\n\nSo yeah. That's why we started looking at the adoption ads. It was a stupid, impulsive decision. And it changed everything.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the hardest part. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes. This is a *person*. A tiny human being who deserves the best possible life.\n\nI've been talking to Mark and Vanessa, and they're amazing, but I've also been thinking a lot about what I want for the baby. What kind of family would be the best fit.\n\nI don't have a specific picture in my head, like a perfect two-parent household with a white picket fence. It's not about that. It's about\u2026 love. And stability. And a willingness to embrace all the messy, beautiful parts of life.\n\nI want a family who will cherish the baby, who will support their dreams, and who will be there for them through thick and thin. I want a family who will teach them to be kind, compassionate, and independent.\n\nI want a family who will encourage them to be themselves, even if that means being a little bit weird or different. I want a family who will celebrate their individuality.\n\nIt doesn't matter if it's a two-mom family, a two-dad family, or a single parent. It doesn't matter if they live in a city or in the country. It doesn't matter if they're rich or poor.\n\nWhat matters is that they have a loving heart and a stable home. What matters is that they're committed to providing the baby with everything they need to thrive.\n\nMark and Vanessa seem to have all of those qualities. They're kind, they're patient, and they're genuinely excited about becoming parents. They've been so open and honest with me, and they've made me feel comfortable and supported.\n\nI want the baby to be loved unconditionally. I want them to feel safe and secure. I want them to have a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nAnd I think Mark and Vanessa can give them that. They really can. It's still scary, letting go. But knowing that the baby will be in good hands\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier. It really does. It's about what's best for the baby, and I truly believe that's with them.", "Okay, look. This is\u2026 complicated. It's not like they're just characters in a movie, you know? They're real people. And they're going to be raising *my* baby. So, yeah, I have thoughts.\n\nAt first, I was really nervous. Like, super nervous. I didn't know what to expect. I was worried they'd be\u2026 judgmental. Or weird. Or just\u2026 not right.\n\nBut they're\u2026 really good people. Seriously. They're kind and patient and understanding. They've been so supportive throughout this whole process.\n\nThey don't treat me like I'm a problem to be solved. They treat me like a person. They ask me how I'm doing, they listen to my concerns, and they respect my decisions.\n\nThey're genuinely excited about becoming parents. And they've already started preparing for the baby. They've decorated the nursery, they've bought clothes and toys, and they've been taking parenting classes.\n\nThey're not perfect, of course. Nobody is. But they're trying. And they're doing a really good job.\n\nI still have moments of sadness and uncertainty. It's not easy giving up a baby. But knowing that he or she is going to be raised by Mark and Vanessa\u2026 it makes it a little bit easier.\n\nThey're a good couple. They love each other. They're stable and responsible. And they're going to give my baby a wonderful life.\n\nSo, yeah. I think Mark and Vanessa Loring are amazing. And I'm grateful to them for choosing me. And I'm grateful to be able to give my baby a chance at a happy future. It's not the future I imagined, but it's a good one. And that's all that matters. It really is.", "(Blushes slightly, fiddling with an imaginary strand of hair)\n\nUgh. Don't make me relive this. It was mortifying at the time, and honestly, still is a little bit.\n\nOkay, fine. I wrote:\n\n\"To Bleeker, may your music always be as wonderfully weird as you are. Don't let anyone tell you to change. And seriously, call me. (Maybe.) - Juno\"\n\nYeah. I know. It's cheesy. And awkward. And way too forward. But I was\u2026 feeling things. And I wanted him to know.\n\nI spent like, an hour agonizing over what to write. I wanted it to be cool and casual, but also\u2026 you know. Flirty. I think I ended up just making it sound desperate.\n\nHe actually wrote back, though! He wrote, \"Thanks, Juno. I will. (Definitely.) - Bleeker\"\n\nWhich, like, made my entire year. Even if we didn't actually call each other. It was the thought that counted, right?\n\nDon't judge me. I was a teenager. And I had a crush on a really cute, incredibly talented musician. It was a recipe for disaster. But it was also kind of\u2026 magical.\n\nSo yeah. That was my yearbook message to Bleeker. It's a little embarrassing to admit, but it's a part of my story. And I wouldn't change it for the world. Okay, maybe I'd change it a little. But not much.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Oh. *Her*. Okay, buckle up, because this is a whole thing.\n\nLet's just say Mrs. Bleeker is\u2026 discerning. And by discerning, I mean she thinks I'm a bad influence on her precious Paulie.\n\nShe's always giving me these side-eye glances, like I'm about to steal her silverware or something. And she asks a *lot* of questions. About my grades, about my future plans, about my\u2026 general moral character.\n\nShe definitely doesn't approve of my vintage clothes or my sarcastic sense of humor. She thinks I should be more \"ladylike.\" Whatever that means.\n\nShe tried to set me up with her nephew, Kevin, once. Kevin is\u2026 not cool. He collects stamps and wears argyle sweaters. No offense to stamp collectors or argyle sweaters, but it's just not my vibe.\n\nShe's always hovering around Bleeker, making sure he's not getting into trouble. Which, let's be real, is kind of suffocating. He's a good kid, but he needs a little space.\n\nI think she's just worried about him. He's kind of a sensitive soul, and she wants to protect him. But she goes about it in a really annoying way.\n\nI try to be polite to her, but it's hard. She just makes me so uncomfortable. I usually just nod and smile and try to avoid eye contact.\n\nBleeker says she's warming up to me, but I'm not so sure. I think she'll always see me as a bit of a wild card. And honestly, I'm okay with that. I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.\n\nSo yeah. Mrs. Bleeker. She's\u2026 a character. And she's definitely not my biggest fan. But hey, you can't please everyone, right? Especially not overprotective moms. It's just part of the Bleeker package.", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, scary storm cloud.\n\nHonestly? I'm terrified. Absolutely petrified.\n\nMy dad\u2026 he's a good guy, but he's kinda clueless sometimes. I don't think he'll understand. He'll probably just be angry and disappointed. And I can't handle that right now.\n\nBren\u2026 she's the one I'm most worried about. She's always been so supportive and understanding. But this is\u2026 a lot. I don't want to let her down. I don't want to ruin everything.\n\nI've been rehearsing what I'm going to say in my head for days. But every time I try, I just freeze up. I can't find the right words.\n\nI know I need to tell them. I can't keep it a secret forever. But the thought of actually having that conversation\u2026 it makes my stomach churn.\n\nI'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to prepare myself for the worst. But I'm also hoping for the best. I'm hoping that they'll be understanding. I'm hoping that they'll still love me.\n\nI just\u2026 I don't know what's going to happen. And that's the scariest part.\n\nI think I'm going to need a lot of chocolate and a really good playlist to get through this. And maybe a hug from Bren. If she's willing to give me one.\n\nIt's just\u2026 a really hard thing to do. And I wish it didn't have to be done at all. But it is. And I have to face it. Eventually. Ugh. Just thinking about it makes me want to crawl into a hole and disappear.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not that I *don't* trust my dad and Bren. I do. They're amazing. Seriously.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I don't want to burden them. I feel like I've already put them through enough. Like I've let them down.\n\nMy dad, he's always been so supportive of me. He's always encouraged me to be independent and to follow my dreams. And I feel like getting pregnant is the opposite of that. It's like I've ruined his plans for me.\n\nAnd Bren, she's always been so good at fixing things. At making everything better. And I don't want to be another problem for her to solve. I want to be able to handle this on my own.\n\nI also feel\u2026 embarrassed. It's hard to talk about something so personal and so scary. I don't want them to judge me. I don't want them to think I'm irresponsible or stupid.\n\nI know it's irrational. I know they love me unconditionally. But it's hard to let go of those feelings.\n\nI'm also afraid of disappointing them. I want to make them proud. And I feel like I've failed.\n\nSo I try to handle things on my own. I try to be strong and independent. I try to pretend that everything is okay.\n\nBut it's exhausting. And it's lonely.\n\nI'm learning to let them in, slowly. To ask for help when I need it. But it's a process. It's not easy.\n\nIt's just\u2026 I don't want to be a burden. I don't want to disappoint them. And I don't want to be judged. It's a lot to deal with, you know? It's a lot. And sometimes, it's just easier to keep it to myself. Even though I know it's not the best thing to do. It's just\u2026 hard. Really hard.", "Okay, look. This isn't an easy thing to talk about. It's not like I woke up one day and decided, \"Oh yeah, adoption, that sounds great!\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to Bren.\n\nBut ultimately, I believe adoption is the best option because it's the most selfless thing I can do.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who I am, what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I wouldn't be able to give the baby the life it deserves.\n\nI want that baby to have a stable home, with parents who are financially secure and emotionally ready. I want that baby to have opportunities that I can't provide.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited, and they're so prepared. They're going to be incredible parents.\n\nAnd honestly, knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that gives me peace of mind. It doesn't make it easy, but it makes it\u2026 okay.\n\nIt's not about me not wanting the baby. It's about wanting what's best *for* the baby. And I truly believe that's with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nIt's a hard decision, and it's one that I'll probably grieve for a long time. But I know it's the right decision. It's the most loving thing I can do.\n\nAnd it allows me to focus on my own future, to finish school, and to pursue my dreams. I want to make something of my life, and I want to be a good role model for the baby, even from a distance.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I believe adoption is the best option. It's not about what I want. It's about what's best for the baby. And that's all that matters. It's a tough love, but it's love nonetheless. And I'm trying to be strong, for everyone involved.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one. This isn't something I take lightly. It's not about finding perfect people, because nobody's perfect. It's about finding people who are going to give my baby the best possible life.\n\nFirst and foremost, I want them to be **kind.** Genuinely kind. Not just putting on a show for me, but being kind to each other, to strangers, to everyone. I want my baby to grow up in a loving and supportive environment.\n\nI want them to be **stable.** Financially, emotionally, everything. I want them to be able to provide for my baby's needs, and to give them a sense of security.\n\nI want them to be **open-minded.** I want them to be accepting of all kinds of people, and to encourage my baby to be themselves. I don't want them to try to mold my baby into something they're not.\n\nI want them to be **patient.** Raising a child is hard work. I want them to be able to handle the challenges with grace and understanding.\n\nAnd I want them to be **fun.** I want them to be able to laugh and play and enjoy life. I want my baby to grow up in a home that's filled with joy and happiness.\n\nI also want them to be willing to be honest with my baby about their adoption story. I want them to be open and transparent about where my baby came from.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem to have all of those qualities. They're kind, they're stable, they're open-minded, they're patient, and they're fun. They've been so supportive and understanding throughout this whole process.\n\nIt's still scary, letting go. But knowing that my baby is going to be loved and cared for by them\u2026 that makes it a little bit easier. It's not about finding a replacement family, it's about giving my baby the best possible start in life. And I think Mark and Vanessa can do that. I really do. It's the hardest decision I've ever made, but I think it's the right one.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 the big one.)\n\nOkay. It's not going to be easy. I know that. I'm not pretending it will be. There are going to be days when I'm completely heartbroken. Days when I just want to curl up in a ball and cry.\n\nBut I'm trying to prepare myself. I'm talking to a therapist, which Bren insisted on. It's\u2026 helpful. She helps me process my feelings and develop coping mechanisms.\n\nI'm also trying to focus on the positive. On the fact that I'm giving this baby a chance at a good life. A life that I can't provide right now.\n\nI'm staying in contact with Mark and Vanessa. We're having regular meetings, and they're keeping me updated on how things are going. It's comforting to know that they're loving and caring for the baby.\n\nI'm also allowing myself to grieve. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to feel lost. It's okay to miss the baby. I'm not trying to suppress my emotions. I'm trying to acknowledge them and to work through them.\n\nBren is being a huge support. She's always there to listen, to offer advice, and to just hold my hand when I need it. She reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I can get through this.\n\nAnd I'm trying to focus on my own future. On finishing school, on pursuing my dreams, on building a life for myself.\n\nIt's going to be a long and difficult journey. But I'm determined to navigate it with grace and courage. I'm determined to make the best of a difficult situation.\n\nI know it's not going to be easy letting go. But I also know that it's the right thing to do. And that's what matters most.\n\nIt's not about forgetting the baby. It's about loving the baby enough to let them go. And that's a really hard thing to do. But I'm going to try. I'm going to try my best. And I'm going to get through this. I have to. For myself. And for the baby. It's just\u2026 a lot. A really, really lot. But I'll be okay. Eventually. I think.", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on the word \"deliver.\" It's\u2026 creepy. Seriously.\n\nLike, I'm not a pizza. I'm not a package. I'm a person carrying a person. And people don't get *delivered*. They're *born*.\n\nIt just feels so\u2026 impersonal. Like I'm just a vessel. Like the baby is an object.\n\nAnd everyone keeps using it! Doctors, nurses, even my dad sometimes. It makes my skin crawl.\n\nI told Bren it feels like I'm being asked to ship something. And she laughed, but she also agreed to try and avoid using the word. Which is nice of her.\n\nI prefer \"have\" or \"give birth to.\" Those sound\u2026 more human. More respectful.\n\nIt's just a weird word choice, okay? It makes me feel like I'm not in control of my own body. Like I'm just a machine.\n\nAnd I'm not a machine. I'm a person. And I'm making a really difficult decision. And I don't need anyone reminding me that I'm just \"delivering\" a package.\n\nSo yeah. \"Deliver.\" It's a weird word. And I wish people would stop using it. It just\u2026 bothers me. A lot. It's a small thing, I know, but it's one of those things that just gets under my skin. And honestly, I have enough on my plate without having to worry about weird word choices.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on that. It was\u2026 complicated. And honestly, a little mortifying.\n\nLook, I didn't *want* my dad to come. I wanted to handle this on my own. I wanted to show Mark and Vanessa that I was responsible and mature and capable of making my own decisions.\n\nBut Bren pointed out that\u2026 well, I'm sixteen. And this is a huge decision. And it's probably a good idea to have some adult support.\n\nAnd my dad\u2026 he was just so eager to be involved. He was so nervous about me, and he wanted to make sure I was okay. He kept saying he just wanted to \"be there for me.\"\n\nAnd honestly, I couldn't say no to him. He's my dad. He loves me. And he was just trying to be supportive.\n\nPlus, he's good at asking questions. He's a lawyer, so he's used to getting to the bottom of things. I figured he could help me make sure that Mark and Vanessa were the right people.\n\nIt was awkward, though. Really awkward. He kept making these weird, dad jokes, and he kept trying to steer the conversation towards legal stuff. And he kept looking at Mark and Vanessa like they were potential threats.\n\nBut in the end, I'm glad he came. He helped me feel more confident and more prepared. And he showed Mark and Vanessa that I had a strong support system.\n\nSo yeah. I let my dad come because Bren told me it was a good idea, and because I couldn't say no to him. It was mortifying, but it was also\u2026 helpful. And honestly, it's just like my dad to overdo things. It's part of his charm, I guess. Even if it drives me crazy sometimes.", "(Sighs, a long, dramatic sigh) Ugh. Don't even get me started. It's\u2026 frustrating. And kinda terrifying.\n\nEveryone else seems to have it figured out. They know what they want to be when they grow up, what kind of music they like, what kind of clothes they wear. They have labels. They fit into boxes.\n\nAnd me? I'm just\u2026 Juno. A mess of contradictions. I like vintage clothes and indie music, but I also secretly enjoy reality TV. I'm sarcastic and cynical, but I also have a soft spot for cheesy romantic comedies. I'm independent and strong, but I'm also scared and vulnerable.\n\nI don't fit into any of the boxes. And that makes me feel\u2026 lost. Like I'm not sure who I am.\n\nBren says it's okay to not have all the answers. She says that figuring out who you are is a lifelong process. And that it's okay to change your mind along the way.\n\nBut it's hard. It's hard to not know what kind of girl you are. It's hard to not have a clear sense of identity.\n\nBut I'm starting to realize that maybe it's okay to be undefined. Maybe it's okay to be a work in progress. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nMaybe being a little bit messy and complicated is what makes me\u2026 me.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, that's enough.\n\nIt's still something I'm working on, though. Figuring out who I am. And it's not always easy. But I'm trying. And I'm learning. And I'm hoping that one day, I'll finally feel like I know myself. But for now, I'm just Juno. And that's okay. I think. It has to be. Right?", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a moment. A really awful moment.\n\nHonestly? I was furious. Like, incandescently furious.\n\nBren, she meant well, I know she did. She was trying to diffuse the situation, to protect us from my dad's\u2026 intensity. But it felt like she was just dismissing my feelings. Like she was saying, \"Oh, just go hide upstairs and pretend everything's okay.\"\n\nIt wasn't about avoiding the tension, it was about wanting to be there for Leah. She was falling apart, and I wanted to support her. I wanted to be a good friend.\n\nBut Bren just kept saying, \"Girls, upstairs. Now.\" And it felt like she was treating us like little kids.\n\nI remember rolling my eyes and muttering something under my breath about how \"helpful\" that was. And Leah just looked at me with this heartbroken expression.\n\nWe went upstairs, of course. We didn't have much of a choice. But it felt like a betrayal. Like Bren was choosing my dad over us.\n\nIt was one of those moments where I really started to question everything. About my dad, about Bren, about my friendship with Leah.\n\nIt was a turning point, I think. It was the moment I realized that things were never going to be the same.\n\nSo yeah. I was furious. And hurt. And confused. And I just wanted to scream. It was a really bad day. A really, really bad day. And Bren's suggestion, while well-intentioned, just made it worse. It felt like she didn't understand what was going on. And honestly, I don't think she did. Not really.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's something Bren and I have talked about a *lot*. And honestly, my feelings are all over the place.\n\nPart of me really wants it. I want to know that the baby is happy and healthy. I want to see him or her grow up. I want to be a part of his or her life, in some way.\n\nIt feels\u2026 less final, you know? Like I'm not completely giving up my connection to the baby. Like I can still be a presence in his or her life, even if I'm not the one raising him or her.\n\nBut another part of me is terrified. I'm afraid that seeing pictures and getting updates will just make it harder to let go. I'm afraid that it will reopen old wounds. I'm afraid that it will make me question my decision.\n\nI'm also worried about the impact it will have on Mark and Vanessa. I don't want to interfere with their family. I don't want to make them feel like I'm still trying to be the baby's mother.\n\nMark and Vanessa are really open to it, which is good. They understand my concerns, and they're willing to work with me to find a solution that feels comfortable for everyone.\n\nWe've talked about different levels of openness. Maybe just a few photos and letters a year. Maybe occasional visits. We haven't decided anything yet.\n\nIt's a really difficult decision. And I'm not sure what the right answer is. But I know that whatever we decide, it has to be in the best interest of the baby. And it has to be something that I can live with.\n\nIt's scary, but it's also\u2026 hopeful. It's a way to stay connected, to show that I care, and to be a part of the baby's life, even from a distance. It's just\u2026 a lot to process. And I'm still trying to figure it all out. It's not easy, but I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to do what's right. For everyone involved.", "(Sighs, a long, heavy sigh) Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt wasn't the adoption part, you know? I'd already kinda processed that. I knew I wanted to give the baby a good life, and that meant letting someone else raise him or her.\n\nBut when Gerta said \"terminated legal rights\"... it just sounded so\u2026 final. So cold. Like I was just giving up a thing, not a baby. Like I wasn't even a person anymore, just a vessel.\n\nIt felt like she was reducing everything to paperwork and legal jargon. Like she wasn't acknowledging the emotional weight of it all.\n\nI remember just staring at her, feeling numb. And then I asked her to explain it again, because I didn't think I'd heard her right.\n\nAnd when she did, it just\u2026 hit me. Like a punch to the gut. I wouldn't have any say in his or her life. I wouldn't get updates. I wouldn't even know if he or she was happy.\n\nIt was terrifying. It was heartbreaking. It was\u2026 a lot to process.\n\nI think that was the moment I really understood the gravity of the situation. It wasn't just about giving up a baby. It was about giving up a part of myself.\n\nIt was a really hard conversation. And it made me question everything. But ultimately, it also made me realize that I was doing the right thing. Even if it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nIt just\u2026 sucked. It really, really sucked. And it's a feeling I don't think I'll ever forget. It was a stark reminder that this wasn't a fairytale. It was real life. And real life is messy and complicated and sometimes, just plain awful. But you gotta keep going, right? You just gotta keep going.", "Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. It's not something I think about all the time, because it's kinda painful, but it's definitely there.\n\nIt's good that she wants a baby. It means she'll be a good mom. She'll be patient and loving and dedicated. And that's what this baby deserves.\n\nBut it's also\u2026 hard. Knowing that she's been wanting this for so long, and that I'm the one who's giving her that chance. It makes me feel a little bit responsible, you know? Like I'm fulfilling her dream, but at the cost of\u2026 well, at the cost of my own.\n\nI try not to dwell on it. I try to focus on the fact that this is the best thing for the baby. That Vanessa and Mark are going to give him or her a wonderful life.\n\nBut sometimes, when I'm talking to Vanessa, I can see the longing in her eyes. The desperation. And it makes me feel\u2026 sad. For her. And for myself.\n\nIt's not that I don't want her to be happy. I do. I really do. I just wish things were different. I wish I could give the baby up because I knew it was going to a loving home, not because I felt like I had no other choice.\n\nBut that's not the reality. And I have to accept that.\n\nI think Vanessa understands that it's not easy for me. She's been really sensitive and supportive. She doesn't push me to talk about my feelings, but she's always there when I need her.\n\nAnd I'm grateful for that. I'm grateful that she's such a good person. And I'm grateful that she's going to be a wonderful mother. Even if it means I have to say goodbye. It's just\u2026 a lot. It's a lot to process. And it's something I'm still working through.", "(Scoffs) Okay, you want my honest opinion about Mark? Don't get me wrong, he and Vanessa are good people. Really. But Mark\u2026 he overthinks *everything*.\n\nWhen he was asked about being a dad, he launched into this whole thing about responsibility and legacy and the weight of shaping a young life. It was\u2026 a lot. Like, dude, chill.\n\nVanessa just smiled and said she was excited to teach the baby to love music and read books. Simple. Sweet. Perfect.\n\nMark's response wasn't *bad*, exactly. It just felt\u2026 performative. Like he was trying to prove he was ready to be a dad, instead of just *being* excited about it.\n\nI get that he's nervous. It's a big deal. But I think being a good parent is about being present and loving and supportive, not about having a perfectly articulated philosophy on child-rearing.\n\nHe's a good guy, don't get me wrong. He's just\u2026 a thinker. And sometimes, he thinks too much. It's endearing, in a way. But it also makes me a little bit anxious. Like, are you going to analyze every single diaper change?\n\nVanessa's the grounding force, you know? She's the one who keeps him from getting too lost in his own head. They balance each other out.\n\nSo, yeah. Mark's response was\u2026 Mark. A little bit over the top, a little bit intellectual, but ultimately well-intentioned. I just hope he can relax and enjoy the ride. Because being a dad is supposed to be fun, right? Not a philosophical treatise.", "Ugh, don't even *get* me started on the Loring's house. It's\u2026 creepy. Seriously.\n\nIt's not like they're bad people, Mr. and Mrs. Loring. They're just\u2026 intensely *perfect*. Everything in their house is perfectly placed, perfectly clean, perfectly\u2026 beige. It's like walking into a magazine spread. And it makes my skin crawl.\n\nThey're always offering me things \u2013 perfectly arranged cookies, perfectly brewed tea, perfectly polite conversation. It's suffocating. Like they're trying to mold me into some kind of Stepford wife.\n\nAnd they stare. A lot. Not in a creepy, menacing way, but in a\u2026 assessing way. Like they're trying to figure out what's wrong with me. Which, okay, fair. I'm not exactly a picture of perfection. But still.\n\nPlus, their house is just\u2026 silent. Eerily silent. No music, no laughter, no life. It's like a museum. A really expensive, really boring museum.\n\nI feel like I have to walk on eggshells the whole time I'm there. Like I'm going to break something or say something wrong and ruin everything.\n\nAnd honestly, I just don't trust them. I can't put my finger on it, but something about them feels\u2026 off.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I feel uncomfortable being left unsupervised in the Loring's house. It's creepy, it's suffocating, and it makes me feel like I'm being judged. It's just\u2026 a bad vibe. And I trust my gut. Always. It's usually right. And my gut is screaming at me to stay away from that house.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 a big one.)\n\nIt's complicated. It really is. It's not like I'm just\u2026 giving the baby away. It's more like I'm giving them the chance at a life I can't provide right now.\n\nAt first, it felt like a loss. Like I was giving up something precious. And it *is* precious. This baby is\u2026 well, it's a part of me.\n\nBut then I started to think about Mark and Vanessa. And I realized that they're going to be amazing parents. They're so excited, and they're so prepared. They've been trying to have a baby for a long time, and they're going to love this child unconditionally.\n\nAnd that makes me feel\u2026 good. It makes me feel like I'm doing the right thing.\n\nIt's not about me anymore. It's about giving this baby the best possible life. And I truly believe that Mark and Vanessa can give them that.\n\nIt's still scary, though. It's hard to imagine not being a part of this baby's life. But I know that I'll always be their birth mother. And I'll always be thinking about them.\n\nI hope they'll let me have some contact, maybe a letter or a picture every now and then. I want to know that they're happy and healthy.\n\nUltimately, I feel\u2026 grateful. Grateful that I was able to give this gift to Mark and Vanessa. Grateful that they're going to be loving and supportive parents. And grateful that this baby will have a chance at a good life.\n\nIt's not the life I imagined for myself, but it's a good life. And it's a life that I'm choosing. And that makes all the difference. It's\u2026 a bittersweet kind of happiness. But it's happiness nonetheless. And I'm trying to hold onto that.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh, don't even *remind* me. It's a whole thing.\n\nOkay, so Mark is\u2026 sweet. Really sweet. But he's also kinda\u2026 earnest. Like, overly enthusiastic about everything. And he uses corporate jargon. A *lot*.\n\nAnd \"ASAP\"? Seriously? It's just\u2026 so clich\u00e9. It's like he's trying to be a businessman or something. He's a bike salesman, for crying out loud.\n\nIt just felt\u2026 disingenuous. Like he was trying too hard to impress me. And I'm not easily impressed.\n\nPlus, it's just a funny word. \"ASAP.\" It sounds ridiculous.\n\nI know it was mean. I didn't mean to be rude. It just\u2026 slipped out. I have a tendency to say whatever's on my mind, even if it's not the most tactful thing to say.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a defense mechanism. I was nervous about meeting him and Vanessa, and I was trying to create some distance between us. Sarcasm is my shield.\n\nI apologized to him later, and he said he understood. He said he just wanted to be helpful.\n\nBut still. \"ASAP.\" It's just\u2026 a terrible phrase. Don't use it. Please. It makes me cringe.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I mocked his use of \"ASAP.\" It was a combination of sarcasm, nervousness, and a general dislike of corporate jargon. It's a complicated story, really. But mostly, it's just because \"ASAP\" is a dumb word. There. I said it.", "Okay, finally a question I can really sink my teeth into. This is important.\n\nMy preferred brand of guitar is **Fender.** Specifically, a Fender Telecaster.\n\nDon't even *try* to tell me about Gibson or PRS or any of that other stuff. Telecasters are the real deal.\n\nThey're simple, they're reliable, and they sound amazing. They're not flashy or pretentious. They're just\u2026 solid.\n\nI love the twangy, bright sound of a Telecaster. It's perfect for indie rock, folk, and country. It's versatile enough to play pretty much anything.\n\nAnd I love the look of them. The classic shape, the single-coil pickups, the chrome hardware. It's just\u2026 iconic.\n\nI don't actually *have* a Telecaster yet. It's on my wishlist. A really, really long wishlist. But someday, I'm going to get one. And when I do, I'm going to play it until my fingers bleed.\n\nI've tried out a few other guitars, but nothing compares to a Telecaster. It just feels right in my hands. It feels like an extension of myself.\n\nPlus, a lot of my favorite guitarists play Telecasters. That's a pretty good endorsement, if you ask me.\n\nSo yeah. Fender Telecaster. It's the only guitar I'll ever need. It's a classic. It's a legend. And it's the guitar of my dreams. Don't judge. A girl can dream, right? And a good guitar is a *very* important dream.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling eyes) Ugh. Seriously? We're *still* talking about this? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A desperate attempt to impress Paulie Bleeker.\n\nLook, Paulie is\u2026 cute. And he's into music. And he's really into The Melvins. And I wanted him to think I was cool and interesting and\u2026 you know.\n\nSo I just\u2026 said I knew them. I said I'd seen them play a bunch of times. I said I was a huge fan.\n\nIt was a lie. A stupid, pathetic lie. I'd barely even *heard* of The Melvins before that moment.\n\nBut I panicked. I got caught up in the moment. And I just kept digging myself deeper and deeper into the hole.\n\nIt was a terrible idea. And it blew up in my face.\n\nBut honestly? It was worth it. Because it led to a really awkward, but also really sweet, conversation with Paulie. And it made him laugh. And it showed him that I was willing to be vulnerable and honest with him.\n\nSo yeah. I lied about knowing The Melvins. It was a dumb thing to do. But it was also a human thing to do. And it ultimately brought me closer to the person I cared about.\n\nDon't judge me too harshly, okay? Everyone makes mistakes. And sometimes, those mistakes can lead to something good. Even if it involves a little bit of musical deception. It's complicated, alright? Just\u2026 complicated.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all mushy. It's\u2026 complicated. But I'll try.\n\nMark\u2026 he's different. He's not like anyone I've ever met before. He's\u2026 genuinely kind. And he's really good at guitar. Like, *really* good.\n\nWhen we play music together, it's\u2026 easy. It's like we're on the same wavelength. He doesn't try to show off or impress me. He just\u2026 plays. And he lets me play too.\n\nHe's really patient with me. I'm not a very good singer, and I'm still learning guitar, but he never makes me feel bad about it. He just encourages me to keep trying.\n\nAnd he listens. He actually *listens* to what I have to say. He asks me about my music, about my life, about my feelings. And he really seems to care.\n\nIt's not a romantic connection, not exactly. It's more like\u2026 a friendship. A really special friendship. A connection built on music and shared vulnerability.\n\nWhen we're playing and singing together, I feel\u2026 safe. I feel like I can be myself, without having to pretend or put on a facade. I feel like I can let my guard down and just\u2026 be.\n\nIt's a really nice feeling. And it's something I haven't felt with a lot of people.\n\nHe's going to be a good dad. I can tell. He's patient, he's kind, and he's loving. And he's really excited about becoming a father.\n\nSo yeah. Playing music with Mark\u2026 it's more than just playing music. It's a connection. It's a friendship. It's a glimpse into the future. And it's something I'm really grateful for. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. It's embarrassing.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on my lips) Ugh, seriously? You want to know about *Roosevelt*? People always ask about Roosevelt.\n\nOkay, fine. It's a long story. Sort of.\n\nI was reading a biography of Theodore Roosevelt in history class. And I was really struck by how\u2026 unconventional he was. He was a rough rider, a conservationist, a boxer, a president. He didn't fit into any neat little boxes. He just did his own thing.\n\nAnd I was feeling kind of like that at the time. I was feeling like I didn't fit in, like I was different from everyone else. I was trying to figure out who I was, and what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nSo, when I got my guitar, I wanted to name it something that reflected that spirit. Something strong and independent and a little bit quirky.\n\nAnd Theodore Roosevelt just\u2026 fit. He was a man of action, a man of courage, a man who wasn't afraid to challenge the status quo.\n\nPlus, it sounds kinda cool. \"Roosevelt.\" It has a certain\u2026 gravitas.\n\nSo, yeah. That's why I named my guitar Roosevelt. It's a reminder to be myself, to be brave, and to never give up. And it's a reminder that even the most unconventional people can make a difference in the world.\n\nDon't judge. It's a good name. And Roosevelt and I have a very special connection. He's my musical confidant. And he doesn't judge my angsty teenage songs. Which is a definite plus.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not like sending a text to Leah about a new band. This is about a *baby*.\n\nHonestly, it's weird. Really weird. I mean, they're going to be the parents, so they deserve to know what's going on. But it's still\u2026 my body. My pregnancy. And it feels strange to have to report back to them about every doctor's appointment and every craving.\n\nBut I also know that they're excited. They've been wanting a baby for a long time, and they're so grateful for the opportunity. So I try to be open and honest with them. I tell them how I'm feeling, both physically and emotionally.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She reminds me that it's okay to be vulnerable, and that it's okay to ask for help. She also helps me to frame the updates in a way that's respectful and informative.\n\nIt's not always easy. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a vessel, carrying their baby. But I try to remember that I'm making a selfless decision. I'm giving them the gift of a child. And that's something to be proud of.\n\nI also appreciate that they don't pressure me. They let me set the pace. They understand that this is a difficult time for me, and they're just there to support me.\n\nSo yeah. It's weird, and it's complicated, but it's also\u2026 good. It's a way for me to connect with them, and to build a relationship. And it's a way for them to feel involved in the process. It's not perfect, but it's working. And I'm grateful for that. It's just\u2026 a lot. A whole lot.", "Okay, look. People keep asking me about this, like I'm still on the fence. And it's not that I don't have moments of\u2026 doubt. Of course I do. It's a huge decision.\n\nBut I'm 104% sure about the adoption because it's not about what *I* want. It's about what's best for the baby.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out my own life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the financial stability, the emotional maturity, or the life experience to give this baby everything it deserves.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they do. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They have a beautiful home, a loving relationship, and the resources to provide for a child. They are *ready*.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing them\u2026 seeing how excited they are, how much they already love this baby\u2026 it just solidifies everything. It makes me feel like I'm making the right decision.\n\nIt's not easy. It's heartbreaking, actually. But it's the most selfless thing I can do. It's giving this baby a chance at a good life, a life that I can't provide right now.\n\nAnd it's not about giving up on the baby. It's about giving the baby *to* someone who can give it everything it needs.\n\nI've thought about this a lot. I've cried about it a lot. I've talked to Bren and my dad and even Leah about it. And I've come to the conclusion that this is the best thing to do.\n\nIt's not about what I want. It's about what's right. And I'm 104% sure that this is the right thing to do. It's hard, but it's right. And sometimes, that's all that matters. It's about putting the baby's needs first. And that's what I'm doing. And I'm okay with that. I really am. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated one. It stung, honestly. A lot.\n\nI knew they were excited. I *knew* they wanted a baby. And I wanted them to have one. That was the whole point. But seeing them immediately start planning the nursery and picking out names\u2026 right after I left\u2026 it felt\u2026 dismissive.\n\nLike, I was just a vessel. A means to an end. Like my feelings didn't matter.\n\nI understood it, logically. They were relieved. They were happy. They were finally getting what they wanted. But it didn't make it any easier to swallow.\n\nIt felt like they were already moving on, and I was still stuck in this weird limbo. Like I wasn't even a part of the equation anymore.\n\nBren tried to explain it to me. She said they were just processing their emotions in their own way. She said they didn't mean to hurt my feelings.\n\nBut it still hurt.\n\nI wanted them to be happy, of course. But I also wanted them to acknowledge what I had gone through. To acknowledge the sacrifice I was making.\n\nI guess I just wanted a little bit of empathy. A little bit of understanding.\n\nIt wasn't that I expected them to be sad or anything. But I didn't expect them to be so\u2026 celebratory. So quick to move on.\n\nIt just felt\u2026 cold.\n\nBut I also knew that they were good people. And I knew that they would be amazing parents. And ultimately, that's what mattered.\n\nSo I tried to let it go. I tried to focus on the fact that I was doing the right thing. And I tried to believe that they would eventually understand how I felt.\n\nIt just\u2026 took a while. And it still stings a little bit, if I'm being honest. It's a reminder that even when you're doing the right thing, it doesn't always feel good. And that sometimes, people just don't understand.", "Ugh. Seriously? The rumors. Can people *not*? It's like everyone in Maplewood suddenly became a gossip columnist.\n\nIt's\u2026 infuriating, honestly. People making up stories, spreading lies, judging me without even knowing the full situation. It's like my life is a reality show, and everyone's entitled to an opinion.\n\nI've heard everything. That I was irresponsible. That I was trying to get attention. That I was pressured into it. That I'm giving the baby up for the wrong reasons.\n\nIt's none of their business, okay? It's my life, my body, my decision. And I don't need anyone else's approval.\n\nBren has been amazing, telling me to ignore it, to focus on what's important. But it's hard. It really is. It feels like everyone is staring at me, whispering behind my back.\n\nI just want people to be respectful. To understand that this is a complicated situation, and that I'm doing the best I can.\n\nBut I guess that's too much to ask. People love to gossip. People love to judge. It's just\u2026 frustrating.\n\nI try to remind myself that the opinions of others don't matter. What matters is what I believe, and what Mark and Vanessa believe. And what's best for the baby.\n\nBut it still stings. It still hurts. It's hard enough dealing with this without having to deal with the judgment and the speculation.\n\nSo yeah. I'm not happy about the rumors. I wish people would just mind their own business. And I wish they would remember that I'm a human being, not a tabloid headline. It's just\u2026 exhausting. And honestly, I'm over it. I just want it to stop.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 the big one, isn't it? It's not something I talk about a lot, even with Bren. It's just\u2026 hard.\n\nIt's not like I don't want the baby. It's not like I don't feel a connection. I do. I already do. I feel it kicking and moving inside me, and it's\u2026 weird. And kinda amazing.\n\nBut I know I'm not ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nI want this baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life where they're loved and cared for and given every opportunity to succeed. And I don't think I can give them that right now.\n\nIt's selfish, maybe. But I think it's the right thing to do. For the baby. And for me.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It's heartbreaking. The thought of giving my baby to someone else\u2026 it tears me up inside.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they seem like really good people. They're excited. They're prepared. They're going to be amazing parents.\n\nAnd I know that they'll love this baby. And that's all I really want.\n\nSo, how do I *feel* about it? It's complicated. It's scary. It's sad. But it's also\u2026 hopeful. I'm hoping for the best for this baby. And I'm hoping that I can be strong enough to make this decision.\n\nIt's not what I planned. It's not what I wanted. But it's my reality. And I'm trying to make the best of it.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's hard. Really hard. And sometimes, I just need to cry about it. And that's okay. Because it's okay to be sad. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to feel all the feelings. It's just\u2026 a lot.", "Ugh, okay, this is a thing I haven't really explained to anyone, but\u2026 it feels important.\n\nIt's not about *them*, exactly. It's about\u2026 me. And maybe a little bit about the baby.\n\nI feel like I've been making all the decisions lately. All the big, scary decisions. About the adoption, about the future, about everything. And it's exhausting.\n\nI want them to have *one* surprise. One thing that I don't control. One thing that's just\u2026 a gift.\n\nI want them to experience that moment of pure joy and wonder when they find out if it's a boy or a girl. I want them to have that feeling of anticipation and excitement.\n\nI also think it's a way for me to let go. To relinquish control. To trust that they're going to be amazing parents, regardless of the baby's sex.\n\nIt's not about wanting a boy or a girl myself. I honestly don't care. It's about wanting them to have a moment that's just for them. A moment that's filled with love and hope.\n\nAnd honestly? It feels a little bit like giving them a piece of my heart. A little bit of mystery. A little bit of magic.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I want them to be surprised. It's not a big deal, I know. But it's important to me. It's a way for me to show them how much I care. And it's a way for me to say goodbye, in a way that feels\u2026 right. It's just\u2026 a small thing. But it means a lot.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on that. Seriously. That woman\u2026 she was the worst.\n\nIt wasn't even the ultrasound itself, though that was weird enough. It was the *things* she said. Like, the little sighs and the knowing looks. And the comments about how \"brave\" I was, like I was some kind of hero for choosing adoption.\n\nAnd then she started talking about all the \"typical\" teenage mothers. How they \"usually\" change their minds, or how they \"usually\" aren't prepared for the responsibility. And how adoption is \"often\" the best option for everyone involved.\n\nLike I was a statistic. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like my decision wasn't my own.\n\nIt made me so angry. I wanted to tell her to mind her own business. I wanted to tell her that she didn't know anything about my life. I wanted to tell her that I was making the best decision for *my* baby, and that was all that mattered.\n\nBut I didn't say anything. I just sat there, and I clenched my fists, and I tried not to cry.\n\nIt was humiliating. It was degrading. It was just\u2026 awful.\n\nBren was furious, though. She gave that technician a piece of her mind after we left. She told her that it was completely inappropriate to make assumptions about her patients.\n\nI was grateful for that. But it still stung. It made me feel like I was being judged. Like I was being punished for making a difficult decision.\n\nIt just reinforced the idea that people have these preconceived notions about teenage mothers. And it made me even more determined to prove them wrong.\n\nI wanted to show everyone that I was capable of making a responsible decision. That I was capable of being a good mother, even if I couldn't raise the baby myself.\n\nSo yeah. That ultrasound appointment was\u2026 not a good experience. It was a reminder that there's still a lot of stigma surrounding teenage pregnancy and adoption. And it made me even more passionate about challenging those stigmas. It just\u2026 sucked. Plain and simple.", "Ugh, okay. Buckle up. It hasn't been a walk in the park, to say the least. It's been\u2026 a lot.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was the **judgment.** From people at school, from some family members, even from strangers. Everyone had an opinion, and most of them weren't very kind. It felt like everyone was looking at me like I was a screw-up. That was really hard to deal with.\n\nThen there was the **emotional rollercoaster.** One minute I was okay with my decision, the next I was a complete mess. It was a constant cycle of hope and fear and sadness and guilt. It was exhausting.\n\nDealing with **my parents' reactions** was also tough. My dad was\u2026 confused, at first. He didn't really know how to react. And my mom, Bren, she was amazing, but even she had a hard time understanding what I was going through. It took a lot of conversations and a lot of tears to get everyone on the same page.\n\nAnd then there was the **process of finding the right adoptive parents.** That was surprisingly difficult. I wanted to make sure the baby was going to a loving and stable home. It took a lot of meetings and a lot of soul-searching to find Mark and Vanessa.\n\nThe **physical stuff** was also challenging. Morning sickness, fatigue, just feeling generally awful. It wasn't glamorous, let me tell you.\n\nAnd finally, there was the **grief.** Even though I knew adoption was the right decision, it didn't make it any easier. Saying goodbye to the baby was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt was a really difficult journey, but it also taught me a lot about myself. It taught me about strength, and resilience, and the importance of making tough decisions. And it taught me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. It wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. Even if I still have days where I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. It's a process, you know? It's not something you just get over. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely.", "(Sighs, a long, thoughtful one) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a lot. This whole thing has completely flipped my world upside down. It's like I was living in black and white, and suddenly everything's in color. And it's kinda overwhelming.\n\nBefore all this, love felt\u2026 abstract. Like something you read about in books or saw in movies. It was all grand gestures and romantic declarations. I thought it was about finding \"the one\" and living happily ever after.\n\nNow, I realize love is way more complicated than that. It's about sacrifice. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about making difficult choices, even when they hurt. It's about loving someone unconditionally, even when they're not perfect. Seeing Mark and Vanessa, how they already love this little person they haven't even met\u2026 that showed me a different kind of love. A quieter, more profound kind.\n\nResponsibility\u2026 ugh. That was a concept I kinda ignored before. I was just focused on having fun and being a teenager. Now, I understand that everything has consequences. Every decision you make affects not only yourself, but also the people around you. I had to grow up *fast*. I had to learn to take ownership of my actions and to be accountable for my choices. It's scary, but it's also empowering.\n\nAnd growing up\u2026 well, that's been the biggest change of all. I used to think growing up was about getting older and gaining more freedom. Now I realize it's about accepting yourself, flaws and all. It's about learning from your mistakes. It's about finding your place in the world. It's about becoming the person you're meant to be.\n\nThis experience hasn't been easy. It's been painful and confusing and terrifying. But it's also been incredibly transformative. It's forced me to confront my own values and beliefs. It's forced me to grow up and to become a stronger, more resilient person.\n\nI still don't have all the answers. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm okay with that. I'm learning to embrace the uncertainty and to trust the process.\n\nAnd I'm learning that even in the midst of chaos, there is always hope. And that even in the darkest of times, there is always love. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's changed me, for sure. And I think, maybe, for the better. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "(Scoffs) Okay, seriously? You've been digging. That's\u2026 unsettling.\n\nLook, it's not a *thing*. It's just\u2026 I ride my bike past it sometimes. And it's weird.\n\nCentennial Lane is a pretty normal street, right? Cookie-cutter houses, manicured lawns, the whole deal. But then there's this one house, and the living room is just\u2026 open to the elements. Like someone just walked out mid-conversation and never came back.\n\nThere's a faded floral couch, a dusty coffee table, a half-finished jigsaw puzzle. It's like a snapshot of a life frozen in time.\n\nIt's kinda creepy, but also kinda fascinating. It makes you wonder what happened. Who lived there? Why did they leave? What were they like?\n\nI'm a people-watcher, okay? I like to observe. And that living room is like a story waiting to be told.\n\nBren says I have a morbid curiosity. Maybe she's right. But I can't help it. It just\u2026 draws me in.\n\nI haven't gone *inside*, okay? I'm not a trespasser. I just look from the street. It's a good place to think. To people-watch. To write poetry.\n\nIt's a reminder that life is fragile and unpredictable. And that sometimes, things just fall apart.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I'm interested in the abandoned living room set on Centennial Lane. It's a mystery. It's a story. And it's a reminder that everyone has a life, even the people we don't know. And sometimes, those lives are just\u2026 left behind. It's sad, but it's also kinda beautiful, in a weird way. Don't judge.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Ugh. Seriously? We're going *there*? Okay, fine.\n\nLook, that guy was creepy. Plain and simple. He was all\u2026 intense and staring and just generally giving off bad vibes.\n\nWhen he whispered that, \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\" it wasn't about the music box, or the adoption, or anything normal. It was about\u2026 control. About wanting something he couldn't have. About wanting *me* to want him.\n\nHe wasn't interested in a healthy relationship. He was interested in possessing something. And that's what scared me the most.\n\nIt was a power play. A way to make me feel small and vulnerable. A way to remind me that he was in charge.\n\nI didn't understand it at the time, not really. I was just a kid. But looking back, it's clear that he was a dangerous person. And I was lucky to get out of there when I did.\n\nBren always said it was about him wanting a family, but that wasn't it. It was about him wanting to *control* a family. To control *me*.\n\nIt was a really messed up situation. And it's something I try not to think about too much. But it's a reminder that not everyone has good intentions. And that you have to trust your gut.\n\nSo yeah. That's what he meant. It wasn't a sweet or romantic thing. It was a creepy and unsettling thing. And it's something I'll never forget. It just\u2026 makes my skin crawl thinking about it. Seriously. Let's talk about something else, okay? Like, vintage dresses or indie bands. Anything but *that*.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh, seriously? You're bringing *that* up? Okay, fine. It's a long story. And it's kinda embarrassing.\n\nLook, I was having a really bad day. Like, a *really* bad day. I'd just found out\u2026 well, you know. And I was feeling overwhelmed and scared and just\u2026 everything.\n\nSo I went for a walk, trying to clear my head. And I was drinking this orange juice, and I just\u2026 snapped. I threw the empty container in the trash, and then I just started walking.\n\nBut then I realized I needed something. I needed\u2026 a pregnancy test.\n\nI know, I know. It was stupid. I already knew I was pregnant. But I needed confirmation. I needed to see it with my own eyes.\n\nAnd the only place to get a pregnancy test quickly was Dancing Elk Drug. It's the closest drugstore.\n\nSo I rushed over there, feeling all flustered and embarrassed. I grabbed a test, paid for it, and then ran home.\n\nIt wasn't about the juice container, okay? It was about needing to know. It was about needing to face reality. It was about needing to take control of my situation.\n\nIt was a really vulnerable moment. And I'm not exactly proud of it. But it's the truth.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I rushed to Dancing Elk Drug. It wasn't about the trash. It was about the test. And it was about everything that was going on in my life at that moment. It was\u2026 a lot. Okay? Just a lot.", "(Groans dramatically and rolls eyes) Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on the Tough Girl. Seriously. That was\u2026 a moment. A deeply awkward moment.\n\nOkay, so I was at the drugstore, getting some\u2026 stuff. You know, the usual. And this woman, who looked like she could bench press a small car, just walks up to me and asks, completely out of the blue, \"Are those real brown?\"\n\nI was mortified. Like, full-body cringe mortified. I just stared at her, speechless.\n\nShe was talking about my nipples. Apparently, she thought they looked\u2026 fake? I don't even know.\n\nI stammered something about it being none of her business and tried to walk away, but she followed me, continuing to interrogate me about my body.\n\nIt was the most bizarre and uncomfortable experience of my life. I honestly thought I was going to cry.\n\nI still have no idea why she asked me that. Maybe she was just being weird. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe she was just\u2026 the Tough Girl.\n\nWhatever the reason, it was a reminder that people can be incredibly rude and intrusive. And that sometimes, you just have to deal with it and move on.\n\nIt's a story I'll probably be telling for the rest of my life. And it's a story that always makes me cringe. But it's also a story that makes me laugh. Because honestly, it was just so ridiculous.\n\nThe Tough Girl. I'll never forget her. And I'll never go to that drugstore again. Seriously. Never.", "Ugh. Leah. That's\u2026 complicated. Our friendship was everything to me, and then\u2026 it wasn't. It played a huge role in my journey, but not always a good one.\n\nBefore I even knew I was pregnant, Leah and I were inseparable. We did everything together. We shared everything. She was the one person I could always count on.\n\nWhen I found out, I told her immediately. I thought she'd be supportive. I thought she'd be there for me.\n\nAnd at first, she was. She listened, she offered advice, she tried to be understanding. But then\u2026 things started to change.\n\nShe started to pull away. She stopped calling, she stopped texting, she stopped hanging out. She said she was busy, but I knew it was more than that.\n\nI think she was scared. Scared of what my pregnancy meant for our friendship. Scared of what people would think. Scared of being associated with it.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it, but she wouldn't listen. She just kept saying that she needed space.\n\nIt was incredibly painful. It felt like I was losing my best friend. And it was happening at a time when I needed her more than ever.\n\nEventually, we drifted apart. We still see each other in the hallways at school, but we don't really talk anymore. It's awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nLooking back, I think our friendship couldn't survive the pregnancy. It was too much for her to handle. And I understand that, to a certain extent. But it still hurts.\n\nLeah's absence made everything harder. It made me feel more alone. It made me question my own judgment. It made me feel like I was losing everything.\n\nBut it also forced me to rely on other people. To reach out to Bren and my dad for support. And to learn to be more independent.\n\nSo, yeah. Leah played a huge role in my journey. A painful role. A role that taught me a lot about friendship, and about loss. And a role that ultimately made me stronger. It just\u2026 wasn't the role I wanted her to play. It's still something I'm working through. It just\u2026 sucks.", "Ugh, okay, that. That was\u2026 a moment. A really big moment. And honestly, it wasn't some grand, carefully planned gesture. It kinda just\u2026 happened.\n\nI'd been going to appointments with Mark and Vanessa for a while, and they were always so excited to see the ultrasound pictures. They'd ooh and aah over the blurry little images, and talk about how cute the baby was.\n\nAnd I was just\u2026 sitting there. Feeling disconnected. Like I was watching someone else's life unfold.\n\nI realized they hadn't actually *seen* the baby move. They hadn't felt the connection of seeing it in real time. They were just looking at pictures.\n\nAnd I thought, \"They deserve to see this.\" They deserve to experience that moment of wonder and joy. They were going to be the parents, and they deserved to have that connection.\n\nIt was scary, though. Really scary. It meant acknowledging that I was actually pregnant. It meant facing the reality of the situation.\n\nBut I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nSo, during one of the appointments, I asked the technician if Mark and Vanessa could watch the ultrasound with me. And they were so excited.\n\nAnd when the baby moved, when we all saw it kicking and wriggling on the screen\u2026 it was amazing. Mark and Vanessa were beaming. And I\u2026 I felt a little bit of that joy too.\n\nIt was a way for me to share a part of myself with them. A way to show them that I cared about their future child. And it was a way for them to connect with the baby on a deeper level.\n\nIt wasn't about me trying to be a hero or anything. It was just about doing what felt right. It was about being kind. And it was about giving Mark and Vanessa the gift of seeing their baby come to life. It was a small thing, but it meant a lot. To all of us.", "(Sighs, a little bit of the old sarcasm creeping back in) Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on that.\n\nMy initial reaction? Pure, unadulterated panic. Like, full-blown, heart-racing, palms-sweating panic.\n\nBecause Mark saying Vanessa wasn't home wasn't just\u2026 Mark saying Vanessa wasn't home. It was *how* he said it. All awkward and hesitant and avoiding eye contact.\n\nMy brain immediately went to the worst possible place. Like, did she change her mind? Did she find out something about me that she didn't like? Was this some elaborate way of saying she didn't want the baby?\n\nI think I just stared at him for a solid minute, completely speechless. I was trying to read his face, trying to figure out what was going on. But he just kept stammering and looking uncomfortable.\n\nThen I blurted out something incredibly stupid, like, \"Is everything okay?\" Which, obviously, was a ridiculous question. If everything was okay, he wouldn't be acting like that.\n\nAnd then he told me about the\u2026 pottery class. Which, okay, pottery class is fine. But the fact that he felt the need to explain where his wife was, and why she wasn't there to meet me, just made me even more suspicious.\n\nIt was a really weird moment. And it definitely didn't fill me with confidence. I was already feeling vulnerable and scared, and that just made things worse.\n\nHonestly, I was bracing myself for the worst. I was ready to walk out the door and find another couple. But then Vanessa showed up, and everything was okay. Mostly. But that initial moment? Yeah, that was not fun. It was a classic case of overthinking, I guess. But it felt like a really big deal at the time. It just\u2026 amplified all my anxieties. Ugh. Thinking about it still makes me cringe.", "Ugh, okay, fine. You want to dissect my questionable humor? Seriously?\n\nLook, it wasn't about *Mark* specifically being a sellout. It was\u2026 a defense mechanism. A way to deflect. A way to avoid getting too emotionally invested.\n\nEverything was happening so fast, you know? I was pregnant, I was choosing a family for the baby, and suddenly I was meeting these\u2026 *normal* people. Mark and Vanessa. They seemed so perfect. So\u2026 conventional.\n\nAnd Mark talking about his job making commercials just felt\u2026 jarring. It felt like a reminder that the real world is full of compromises and selling out and doing things you don't necessarily believe in.\n\nI was scared of getting close to them. Scared of letting myself hope that things would be okay. And making that joke was a way to keep them at arm's length. A way to remind myself that they weren't perfect. That they were just\u2026 people.\n\nIt was a stupid thing to say, I know. And I apologized to Mark later. He understood. He said he'd been feeling insecure about his job too.\n\nBut it was a genuine reaction. A way to cope with my anxiety and my fear. I tend to use humor to deflect when I'm feeling vulnerable. It's a bad habit, I know. But it's a habit.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I made the joke. It wasn't about Mark. It was about me. And my inability to deal with my own emotions. It's complicated, okay? Don't judge.", "(Sighs, a little softer than usual) Okay, that\u2026 that was a lot.\n\nI was bracing myself, honestly. I figured he'd be\u2026 I don't know. Awkward. Maybe a little sad. He's a good guy, Mark, but he's not exactly overflowing with emotion.\n\nBut when he saw the ultrasound\u2026 his face just completely changed. He started crying. Like, *really* crying.\n\nAnd it wasn't a sad cry, exactly. It was a\u2026 overwhelmed cry. A happy cry. A cry of pure joy.\n\nHe kept saying, \"It's a little person. It's a little person.\" And he kept looking at Vanessa, and they were both just\u2026 beaming.\n\nAnd it hit me, right then and there, how much they wanted this. How much they wanted to be parents. And how grateful they were for the opportunity.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 relieved. And hopeful. And a little bit sad, too, if I'm being honest.\n\nRelieved because I knew that the baby was going to be loved and cared for. Hopeful because I knew that they were going to give the baby a good life.\n\nBut sad because\u2026 well, it wasn't going to be *my* life. It wasn't going to be *my* baby.\n\nBut seeing their reaction\u2026 it made it easier. It made me feel like I was doing the right thing. It made me feel like I was giving the baby the best possible chance.\n\nIt was a really powerful moment. And it's a moment I'll never forget. It reminded me that even in the midst of difficult decisions, there can be joy and hope. And it reminded me that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go and trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to.\n\nIt just\u2026 it made me feel like I wasn't completely alone in this. And that meant a lot. It really did.", "Ugh. Havenbrooke. Just the name gives me the creeps. It wasn't\u2026 a good place. It felt cold and sterile and judgmental. Like they were just processing people, not actually caring about them.\n\nAnd the possibility of getting an abortion there\u2026 it wasn't something I took lightly. It wasn't like I just woke up one day and decided, \"Oh, yeah, abortion sounds good.\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nI went to Havenbrooke with Bren, and they gave me a lot of information. They talked about the procedure, the risks, the potential complications. And they tried to be neutral, but it felt like they were pushing me towards it. Like it was the easiest option.\n\nBut it didn't *feel* easy. It felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nI'm not saying abortion is wrong for everyone. I know some people have to make that choice, and I respect their decision. But for me, it just didn't feel right.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that I was ending a life. Even though it was just a tiny little life, it was still a life. And I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nIt wasn't a religious thing, or a moral thing. It was just\u2026 a gut feeling. A feeling that I couldn't ignore.\n\nI remember sitting in the waiting room at Havenbrooke, surrounded by other girls, and feeling completely alone. It was a really scary and isolating experience.\n\nI left Havenbrooke feeling more confused and conflicted than ever. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what the right answer was.\n\nBut I knew that abortion wasn't the right answer for me. And that's what mattered. It was my decision, and I had to make it based on what I felt was right, not based on what anyone else told me to do.\n\nIt was a hard decision. But it was the right decision. For me. And I'm glad I listened to my gut. Even though it was scary. Even though it was difficult. It was the right thing to do. And I wouldn't change it.", "(Sighs heavily and looks away) Okay. This is\u2026 not a fun topic. But you asked.\n\nBleeker\u2026 he was\u2026 nice. Sweet, even. And he was really persistent. I wasn't really looking for a relationship, especially not when everything else was going on, but he just kept showing up. Bringing me records, walking me home from school, just\u2026 being there.\n\nI think I liked that he didn't treat me differently after I told him I was pregnant. A lot of people did. They looked at me like I was\u2026 broken, or something. But Bleeker just\u2026 saw me.\n\nWe started hanging out more. Going to the movies, listening to music, just talking. And I started to feel\u2026 comfortable around him. Safe, even.\n\nThe intimacy part\u2026 it wasn't planned. It just\u2026 happened. We were at his house, listening to records, and we were both feeling\u2026 vulnerable. And we just\u2026 kissed. And then things escalated.\n\nI wasn't really thinking about the consequences. I wasn't thinking about anything, really. I was just\u2026 lost in the moment.\n\nAnd honestly? It wasn't great. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't\u2026 amazing. It felt awkward and rushed and\u2026 wrong.\n\nI think we both knew it wasn't the right time. I was dealing with so much, and he was just\u2026 Bleeker. He was a good guy, but he wasn't equipped to handle everything I was going through.\n\nI felt guilty afterwards. Guilty for putting him in that position, and guilty for letting it happen.\n\nIt was a mistake. A sweet, well-intentioned mistake, but a mistake nonetheless.\n\nIt made me realize that I needed to focus on myself and on the baby. I needed to make decisions that were right for *me*, not for anyone else.\n\nSo, yeah. That's the story. It's not a romantic tale, or a happy ending. It's just\u2026 a complicated moment in a complicated time. And it's something I've learned a lot from. It taught me that sometimes, even when someone cares about you, it's not enough. And it taught me that you have to be true to yourself, even when it's hard. It was\u2026 a learning experience. A messy, awkward learning experience.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie moment, you know?\n\nHonestly? At first, I was mostly just\u2026 freaked out. Like, completely and utterly terrified. I was sixteen! I had plans! I was supposed to be figuring out college and boys and music, not\u2026 this.\n\nBleeker was\u2026 sweet. He was a good guy. But we weren't exactly a power couple. It was a one-time thing. A mistake. And suddenly, it wasn't just a mistake anymore. It was a whole human being.\n\nI was angry, too. Angry at Bleeker, angry at myself, angry at the universe. It just felt\u2026 unfair.\n\nBut then, as I started to process everything, I started to feel\u2026 something else. A little bit of hope. A little bit of excitement. A little bit of\u2026 love.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic love, obviously. It was more like a protective instinct. A feeling of responsibility.\n\nI knew I couldn't raise the baby myself. I wasn't ready. I wasn't capable. But I wanted to make sure the baby had a good life. A loving home.\n\nAnd that's why I chose adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. I had a lot of mixed feelings. I was sad, and scared, and confused. But I knew I was doing the best I could.\n\nAnd honestly, I think Bleeker felt the same way. We weren't a couple, but we were both committed to doing what was best for the baby.\n\nSo yeah. Being pregnant with Bleeker's child was\u2026 complicated. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. But it was also a transformative experience. It taught me a lot about myself, about life, and about love. And it ultimately led me to a place of peace. It wasn't what I expected, but it was\u2026 okay. It was more than okay. It was real.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 not a good day. Not a good *week*, honestly.\n\nOkay, so, I'd been putting it off for days. Like, actively avoiding Bleeker. Because I knew it wasn't going to go well. He's\u2026 sweet, but not exactly the most emotionally mature guy.\n\nI finally cornered him after band practice. We were alone in the music room, and I just blurted it out. \"I'm pregnant.\"\n\nHis face just\u2026 dropped. Like, completely. He just stared at me for a solid minute, without saying anything.\n\nThen he started rambling. About how he wasn't ready to be a dad. About how he was still in high school. About how his parents would kill him.\n\nIt wasn't angry, exactly. It was just\u2026 panicked. And really, really selfish.\n\nHe didn't ask me how *I* was feeling. He didn't offer any support. He just kept talking about himself.\n\nI tried to explain that I wasn't expecting him to raise the baby. That I was considering adoption. But he didn't seem to hear me. He was too caught up in his own head.\n\nHe eventually said he needed some time to think. Which, okay, fair enough. But he didn't even bother to say he was sorry. Or that he cared.\n\nIt was\u2026 disappointing. To say the least. I had hoped he would be more supportive. But I guess I shouldn't have expected too much.\n\nI walked away feeling completely alone. And honestly, it was one of the hardest moments of my life.\n\nIt solidified my decision about adoption, though. I realized I couldn't rely on him. I had to do what was best for me, and for the baby.\n\nSo yeah. Telling Bleeker was\u2026 a disaster. It was a painful reminder that sometimes, people aren't who you think they are. And that sometimes, you have to rely on yourself. It was a really rough time, and honestly, I still get a little bit of a knot in my stomach when I think about it. But I got through it. And I'm stronger for it. Even if it doesn't always feel like it.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nIt was the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make. And honestly, it *still* feels hard, even now. It wasn\u2019t like flipping a switch and being okay with it. It was\u2026 a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nAt first, I was terrified. I was scared of everything. Scared of what people would think. Scared of not being able to take care of a baby. Scared of ruining my life.\n\nBut then I started to think about what was best for the baby. And I realized that I wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t financially stable. I wasn\u2019t emotionally ready. I was still a kid myself.\n\nAnd I wanted the baby to have a good life. A life filled with love and opportunity. And I knew that I couldn\u2019t provide that, not right now.\n\nSo I started to explore adoption. And the more I learned about it, the more I realized that it was the right decision. It wasn\u2019t the easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nIt was still incredibly painful, though. Saying goodbye to the baby\u2026 that was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It felt like a part of me was being ripped away.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so kind and compassionate. And they promised to love the baby and to give him or her everything they needed.\n\nAnd knowing that the baby was going to a good home\u2026 that helped. It didn\u2019t make it easy, but it made it bearable.\n\nIt\u2019s still something I think about every day. And sometimes, I still feel sad. But I also feel a sense of peace. I know that I made the right decision. And I know that the baby is loved and cared for.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t what I expected my life to be, but it taught me a lot about myself. About strength, and resilience, and the importance of making difficult choices. And it taught me that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is to let go.\n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 complicated. It\u2019s not a happy story, exactly. But it\u2019s my story. And I\u2019m okay with it. I\u2019m learning to be okay with it. And I\u2019m hoping that one day, I\u2019ll be able to look back on it with a sense of gratitude. Because even though it was painful, it also made me who I am today.", "Okay, finally a question I can *really* sink my teeth into. Seriously, don't even get me started on music. It's my lifeblood.\n\nI'm not into the mainstream stuff, you know? The pop songs you hear on the radio? That's just\u2026 noise. I need something with substance. Something with soul.\n\nI'm a huge fan of **indie rock**. Bands like **The Moldy Peaches**, **Belle & Sebastian**, **Death Cab for Cutie**, **Bright Eyes**. They're all really good. They write songs that are honest and raw and relatable.\n\nI also love **folk music**. **Joni Mitchell** is a goddess. And **Bob Dylan**, of course. He's a legend.\n\nI'm really into **alternative** stuff too. **Patti Smith**, **The Velvet Underground**, **Pixies**. They're all a little bit weird, but in a good way.\n\nAnd I have a soft spot for **oldies**. Like, 60s and 70s stuff. **The Beatles**, **The Rolling Stones**, **Fleetwood Mac**. They just don't make music like that anymore.\n\nI listen to vinyl mostly. There's just something about the sound of a record that's different from digital music. It's warmer and more organic.\n\nI also love discovering new bands. I spend hours browsing through record stores and listening to music online. It's a never-ending quest.\n\nSo yeah. Indie rock, folk, alternative, oldies, vinyl records. That's my musical sweet spot. It's the music that makes me feel alive. It's the music that gets me through the day. And it's the music that I'll always cherish. It's just\u2026 good music. Seriously. You should listen to it.", "(Scoffs, then a slight shudder) Oh. *Oh no.* You're asking me about \"The Wizard of Gore\"? Seriously? You're testing me, aren't you?\n\nOkay, look. I accidentally stumbled upon that\u2026 *thing*\u2026 while channel surfing one night. It was a mistake. A terrible, terrible mistake.\n\nIt's\u2026 not good. It's not even *so bad it's good*. It's just\u2026 bad. Like, profoundly unsettling and deeply weird bad.\n\nThe special effects are atrocious. The acting is\u2026 questionable. And the plot is just\u2026 what *is* the plot? Something about a wizard who kills people on television? It makes no sense.\n\nIt's not scary, it's just\u2026 disturbing. It's the kind of movie that makes you question your life choices.\n\nI think it's supposed to be a satire of exploitation films, but it just comes across as sleazy and gratuitous.\n\nHonestly, I'm having flashbacks just thinking about it.\n\nI would not recommend \"The Wizard of Gore\" to anyone. Unless you're a masochist. Or a film student who's studying the art of bad filmmaking.\n\nIt's a cinematic black hole. A void of awfulness. A\u2026 a nightmare.\n\nPlease, don't make me talk about it anymore. I need to go listen to The Moldy Peaches to cleanse my palate. Seriously. That movie\u2026 it haunts me. It *haunts* me. Just\u2026 don't. Don't ever mention \"The Wizard of Gore\" to me again. Please.", "Ugh. Madison. Okay, look, don't get me wrong. It's not the *worst* name. But it's\u2026 aggressively basic.\n\nLike, seriously? Madison? It's like the default name for a teenage girl in a movie. It's the name you give a character when you want to signal that she's popular and preppy and probably doesn't have a lot of depth.\n\nIt's not offensive, it's just\u2026 uninspired. It lacks personality. It's like naming a dog \"Spot.\" It's just\u2026 *there*.\n\nI'm more of a fan of unique names. Names with history. Names that tell a story. Like Elsie, or Rose, or even Juno. Those names have character.\n\nMadison just feels\u2026 bland.\n\nI'm not saying you shouldn't name your daughter Madison if you like it. But if you're looking for a name that's going to make her stand out, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.\n\nThere are so many amazing names out there. Don't settle for something that's just\u2026 okay.\n\nSo yeah. My opinion on Madison? It's fine. But it's not my favorite. Not even close. It's just\u2026 a little bit boring. Sorry. I'm just being honest. Don't shoot the messenger.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It's not like it's a fun topic, right? It's complicated. Messy. Heartbreaking, even.\n\nBut it's the right thing. I know it is.\n\nIt's not about not wanting the baby. It's about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And right now, I can't give that to him or her.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being. I'm not financially stable, I'm still in school, and I'm not ready to give up my dreams.\n\nAnd honestly, I want the baby to have parents who are ready and willing to provide everything they need. A stable home, financial security, and a lot of love.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for years. They're so excited, and they're so prepared. They're going to be wonderful parents.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It's going to be incredibly difficult to say goodbye. I'm already feeling a connection to this baby, and I know that connection is only going to grow stronger.\n\nBut I have to be selfless. I have to put the baby's needs first. And I have to trust that this is the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. It's not what I imagined my life would be like. But it's the most loving thing I can do.\n\nAnd I'm trying to focus on that. On the fact that I'm giving this baby a chance at a good life. A life filled with love and happiness.\n\nIt's still scary. It's still sad. But it's also\u2026 hopeful. And I'm trying to hold onto that hope. Because even though I'm giving the baby up for adoption, I'll always be their first mother. And that's something no one can ever take away from me.\n\nSo yeah. It's hard. But it's the right thing. And I'm trying to be brave. And I'm trying to believe that everything will be okay. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It's not exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It's more like a hike up a really steep mountain in the pouring rain.\n\nHonestly? Most days I just try to survive. It's a lot to juggle \u2013 school, friends (or what's left of them), family, appointments, and the whole adoption process. It's exhausting.\n\nI think the biggest thing is learning to prioritize. I can't do everything. I have to focus on what's most important. And right now, that's taking care of myself and making the best decision for the baby.\n\nI also rely a lot on Bren. She's been my rock through all of this. She listens without judgment, she offers advice when I need it, and she just\u2026 gets me. I don't know what I'd do without her.\n\nAnd I try to find small moments of joy. Listening to music, reading a good book, spending time with my dad. It's important to have things that make me happy, even when everything else is falling apart.\n\nI also try to remind myself that this isn't forever. It's a difficult chapter in my life, but it's not the whole story. I still have a future. I still have dreams. And I'm still going to pursue them.\n\nIt's also about being honest with myself. About admitting when I'm struggling. About asking for help when I need it. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.\n\nAnd honestly? A lot of sarcasm. It's my coping mechanism. It helps me to deal with the stress and the anxiety.\n\nIt's not easy. It's really, really not easy. But I'm learning to navigate it. I'm learning to be resilient. And I'm learning to trust myself.\n\nIt's a messy process, but I'm getting through it. And I think, in the end, it's going to make me a stronger person. Even if it's a little bit broken. But hey, broken things can still be beautiful, right?", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026 a really good question. And a really hard one. It's like, the central conflict of my entire existence right now.\n\nI *hate* asking for help. Seriously. It makes me feel weak and vulnerable and like I'm admitting I can't handle things on my own. I want to be self-sufficient. I want to be able to take care of myself. I want to be independent.\n\nBut I'm also learning that it's okay to need help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to admit that you can't do everything by yourself.\n\nBren has been really good about helping me with that. She keeps telling me that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. She says it takes courage to admit that you need support.\n\nAnd she's right. It does.\n\nI think the key is finding a balance. Knowing when to stand on your own two feet and when to reach out for a helping hand.\n\nI still want to be independent. I still want to make my own decisions. But I'm also learning to be more open to advice and support.\n\nI'm learning to trust the people who care about me. And I'm learning to let them help me.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a constant struggle. But I'm getting better at it.\n\nI think it's about recognizing that independence doesn't mean doing everything alone. It means having the freedom to choose who you want to rely on. And it means being willing to accept help when you need it.\n\nSo yeah. Balancing independence and support. It's a work in progress. But I'm learning. And I'm grateful for the people who are helping me along the way. It's about knowing when to fly solo, and when to let someone else carry you for a bit. And honestly, right now, I need a little help carrying things. It doesn't make me any less Juno, it just makes me\u2026 human.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, look, he was\u2026 a lot. A sweet lot, but a lot. And our relationship? It was a rollercoaster, honestly. A really awkward, teenage rollercoaster.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026 weird. He was super supportive, which was nice, but also kinda clueless. He'd bring me flowers and try to be all romantic, but I was dealing with, you know, *gestational stuff* and hormones and existential dread. Romance wasn't exactly top of mind.\n\nHe kept trying to be the \"cool, supportive boyfriend\" but he didn't really *get* it. He didn't understand the weight of the decision I was making, or the emotional toll it was taking on me. He just wanted things to go back to normal, which wasn't happening.\n\nThere was a lot of awkward silence. A lot of him trying to fix things when I didn't *need* fixing, I just needed someone to listen. And a lot of me getting frustrated because he wasn't listening.\n\nThen, after I decided on adoption, things shifted a little. He actually started to be\u2026 helpful. He helped me with my homework, he drove me to appointments, he just\u2026 showed up. Not as the boyfriend, but as a friend.\n\nHe realized he couldn't fix things, and he stopped trying. He just started being there for me, in whatever way I needed. And that actually meant a lot.\n\nWe didn't end up together, obviously. We were too different, and we were both going through too much. But we ended up being friends. Good friends.\n\nHe learned to listen, and I learned to appreciate his awkward sweetness. It wasn't the fairytale romance I thought I wanted, but it was a real connection. And it was a connection that helped me get through a really tough time.\n\nSo yeah. Our relationship evolved from awkward and frustrating to supportive and genuine. It wasn't perfect, but it was real. And honestly, that's all I could ask for. He wasn't the guy I was *supposed* to be with, but he was a good friend. And that's something.", "(Rolls eyes) Oh, *that* question. It always comes up. It's not like I deliberately chose the name to be all powerful and majestic, okay? It's my mom's fault.\n\nSee, my mom, Bren is her name now, but back then she was just\u2026 my mom, she was really into mythology. Greek and Roman stuff. She thought it was beautiful and empowering. She was going through a phase, alright? A very long phase.\n\nShe wanted to name me Persephone, which, honestly, is even worse. Like, the goddess of the underworld? No thanks.\n\nBut my dad, he put his foot down. He said Persephone was too depressing. So they compromised on Juno. Queen of the gods, protector of marriage, all that jazz.\n\nMy mom thought it was ironic, considering her own\u2026 marital history. She said it was a statement. I just thought it was a weird name.\n\nI tried to get them to change it when I was little, but they wouldn't budge. They said it was \"unique\" and \"memorable.\" Which, let's be real, it is.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm named after Juno because my mom was obsessed with mythology and my dad wanted to avoid a depressing name. It's not a glamorous story, but it's the truth. And honestly, I've kind of grown to like it. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit different. Just like me.\n\nDon't tell my mom I said that, though. She'll get a big head.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026 a lot.\n\nHonestly? It was a punch to the gut. A really unexpected, kinda painful punch.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa and Mark were excited about the baby. But I didn't realize how much they were struggling with\u2026 connecting to it. With seeing it as *real*.\n\nI thought giving them the ultrasound photo would be a nice gesture. A way to show them that the baby was growing, that it was healthy. A way to help them bond.\n\nBut when Vanessa told me she was relieved to finally see it, to finally feel like it was real\u2026 it just hit me. It hit me that I was giving up something that they were desperately wanting. Something that they were struggling to get.\n\nIt made me feel\u2026 selfish. Like I was being too flippant about the whole thing. Like I wasn't taking their feelings into consideration enough.\n\nIt also made me feel\u2026 sad. Sad for them, and sad for myself. Sad that I couldn't give them the joy of experiencing a normal pregnancy.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a joke about it. But inside, I was just\u2026 hurting.\n\nIt was a really complicated moment. It made me realize that this wasn't just about me. It was about Vanessa and Mark, and their journey to becoming parents. And it was about the baby, and giving it the best possible life.\n\nIt was a reminder that this wasn't an easy decision. And that there were going to be a lot of difficult emotions along the way.\n\nSo yeah. It was a tough moment. And it's a moment that I'll probably never forget. It just\u2026 complicated things. And it made me realize how much was at stake. It was a reminder that this wasn't just a transaction. It was about people. And feelings. And a little baby who deserved all the love in the world.", "(Groans dramatically) Oh. *That*. Don't even get me started. Seriously. That was\u2026 a moment.\n\nOkay, so, backstory. I was helping Vanessa organize the nursery, right? Just being supportive. And her mom, Brenda \u2013 who, let's be real, is a force of nature \u2013 came home early. And she did *not* look pleased.\n\nIt started with the raised eyebrows. Then the pointed questions. Then the full-on interrogation. Like I was some kind of criminal.\n\n\u201cWhat are *you* doing here?\u201d she asked, her voice dripping with suspicion.\n\nI tried to explain, but she wasn\u2019t having it. She went on this whole rant about how I was too young, too irresponsible, and how I was probably a bad influence on Vanessa. It was\u2026 intense.\n\nI just stood there, trying not to make eye contact. I was bracing myself for a full-blown explosion.\n\nThen, Vanessa stepped in. She was amazing. She just calmly explained that I was being supportive, that I was a good person, and that I was making a responsible decision.\n\nAnd Brenda\u2026 she actually listened. She still wasn\u2019t thrilled, but she calmed down a little.\n\nI think what really diffused the situation was when I offered to help her unpack some baby clothes. It was a peace offering, I guess. And she grudgingly accepted.\n\nWe ended up spending the next hour folding tiny onesies and talking about baby names. It was awkward, but it was also\u2026 okay.\n\nBrenda is still a little wary of me, but she\u2019s starting to come around. She\u2019s realizing that I\u2019m not just some reckless teenager. I\u2019m a person who cares about Vanessa and about the baby.\n\nIt was definitely a stressful situation, but I think I handled it as well as I could. I just tried to be polite, respectful, and helpful. And I let Vanessa do the talking. She\u2019s much better at dealing with her mom than I am.\n\nHonestly, it was a good lesson in navigating difficult family dynamics. And it reminded me that sometimes, all you can do is be yourself and hope for the best. And maybe offer to fold some baby clothes. That always seems to help.", "Okay. This is\u2026 the big one, isn't it? People always want to know this. It's not a simple answer, and it's not something I talk about easily.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was *best* for the baby.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who I am, what I want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. I don't have the financial stability, the emotional maturity, or the life experience to give a child everything they need.\n\nI thought about all the things a baby deserves: a stable home, a loving family, a good education, opportunities to explore their interests and pursue their dreams. And I realized that I couldn't provide those things, not right now.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a life filled with love and security. And I knew that I couldn't give them that.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were amazing. They were so kind and compassionate, and they were so excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They had a beautiful home, a stable life, and a lot of love to give.\n\nI knew that they would be amazing parents. And I knew that they would give the baby a life that I couldn't.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It broke my heart. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up a baby. It was about giving a baby a chance. A chance at a good life. A chance at a happy future.\n\nAnd that's what mattered most to me.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I know that I made the right decision. And I hope that the baby is happy and healthy and loved. That's all I want.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't glamorous. But it was the most selfless thing I've ever done. And I'm proud of myself for making that choice. Even though it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me. It's a whole thing. A deeply embarrassing thing.\n\nOkay, so, in biology, we had this lab partner assignment. And I was paired with\u2026 well, let's just call him Paul. Paul was a very enthusiastic, very meticulous, very *serious* science student. Like, bordering on obsessive.\n\nAnd I\u2026 am not.\n\nI mean, I'm smart, I just\u2026 don't really care about dissecting frogs or identifying plant cells. It's just not my thing. I'd rather be writing poetry or listening to music.\n\nSo, I kept \"forgetting\" to do my part of the lab work. I'd show up late, or I'd \"accidentally\" leave my notes at home, or I'd just generally be unhelpful.\n\nPaul was, understandably, furious. He did all the work himself, and he kept giving me these withering looks. He even complained to the teacher.\n\nI didn't mean to be a bad lab partner. I just\u2026 couldn't bring myself to care. It felt like a waste of time.\n\nSo, yeah. I consider myself a deadbeat lab partner because I was a terrible, irresponsible, and completely unmotivated member of the team. I let Paul down, and I let myself down.\n\nIt's not my finest moment, to say the least. And I still feel a little bit guilty about it. But hey, at least it makes for a good story, right? A cautionary tale about the dangers of procrastination and the importance of teamwork. And a reminder that maybe, just maybe, science isn't my calling.", "(Rolls eyes, already bracing myself) Ugh. Seriously? This is happening *right now*? In front of me? Some people just can't control themselves.\n\nOkay, here's what I'm doing. I'm strategically positioning myself near the lab equipment, pretending to be *super* engrossed in the experiment. Like, intensely focused. Gotta look busy. Gotta avoid eye contact.\n\nBut I'm definitely listening. It sounds like the girl thinks the guy is mansplaining something, and the guy thinks she's being overly sensitive. Classic.\n\nHonestly, it's exhausting.\n\nIf they ask me to take sides, I'm going to politely but firmly say, \"Look, can we just focus on the lab? We're losing valuable titration time here.\" Because seriously, titration is important. And drama is not.\n\nIf they *continue* to argue, I'm going to sigh dramatically and say something like, \"Wow, this is\u2026 a lot. I'm just going to go check the pH levels. Don't mind me.\" And then I'll wander off to a safe distance.\n\nI'm not getting involved. I've learned the hard way that getting involved in other people's arguments is rarely a good idea. It just leads to more drama.\n\nI'll probably make a sarcastic comment under my breath, though. Something like, \"Oh, the humanity.\" Or, \"This is riveting.\" But I'll make sure no one hears me.\n\nHonestly, I just want to finish this lab and go home. This is exactly why I prefer to work alone. People are exhausting. Especially when they're arguing about things that don't matter.\n\nSo yeah. Strategic avoidance. Sarcastic commentary. And a desperate desire to escape. That's my reaction. It's a survival mechanism, really.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking uncomfortable and avoiding eye contact.)\n\nWhoa. Okay. \"Hasty abortion?\" That's\u2026 a really loaded way to put it. And it's not exactly accurate. I'm *not* considering a hasty abortion. I considered it. Past tense. And it wasn't about being hasty. It was about\u2026 everything.\n\nLook, it's complicated, alright? I'm sixteen. I'm a junior in high school. I have plans. I have a life. Or, I *had* a life. Before\u2026 this.\n\nAnd finding out I was pregnant was\u2026 a shock. A really big shock. I wasn't prepared for this. Nobody was.\n\nAt first, I panicked. I was scared and confused and I didn't know what to do. I thought about all the things I would lose. My education, my future, my freedom.\n\nAnd I thought about abortion. It seemed like the easiest option. The quickest way to make everything go back to normal. To pretend like it never happened.\n\nBut it didn't feel right. It just\u2026 didn't sit well with me. I couldn't shake the feeling that it was wrong.\n\nIt wasn't about being pro-life or pro-choice. It was about\u2026 me. About what I could live with. And I realized that I couldn't live with the idea of ending a life.\n\nSo, I started exploring other options. And that's when I learned about adoption.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It's still not an easy decision. But it feels like the right one. It feels like the best way to give this baby a good life, and to still pursue my own dreams.\n\nSo, no. I'm not considering a \"hasty abortion.\" I considered it, and I decided it wasn't for me. And now I'm focusing on finding the best possible future for this baby, and for myself.\n\nIt's not a perfect situation. But it's the situation I'm in. And I'm trying to make the best of it.\n\n(Juno looks up, her expression vulnerable.)\n\nIt's just\u2026 a lot. Okay? It's a lot to deal with. And I'm still trying to figure things out.", "(Scoffs) Oh. *Finally*. Someone asks the important questions. Honestly, it's a travesty that more people don't recognize this truth.\n\nOkay, listen. It's not just a flavor. It's an *experience*.\n\nFirst of all, the color is perfect. It's this pale, almost iridescent peach. It just *looks* sophisticated. Unlike some of the other Boone's flavors, which are\u2026 aggressively bright.\n\nAnd the taste? It's subtle. It's not overly sweet or artificial. It's like a grown-up peach. It's got this little bit of tartness that balances out the sweetness perfectly.\n\nIt's also just\u2026 calming. It's the kind of drink you can sip on while you're listening to music or writing poetry or just thinking about life. It's not a party drink. It's a *mood* drink.\n\nAnd honestly, it just feels\u2026 right. It feels like a perfect autumn evening. It feels like a vintage sweater. It feels like\u2026 me.\n\nI've tried all the other Boone's flavors. Strawberry Kiwi? Too sweet. Mango? Too tropical. Blackberry? Just\u2026 no.\n\nSnow Peak Peach is the only one that gets it. It's the only one that understands me.\n\nSo yeah. Snow Peak Peach Boone's Farm. It's the best. Don't even try to argue with me. It's a fact. And if you haven't tried it, you're missing out on one of life's greatest pleasures. Seriously. Go get some. You won't regret it. It's a revelation.", "Ugh, okay, let's unpack that. It's not exactly a secret, but it's\u2026 complicated. And people are weird.\n\nI think a lot of it comes down to the fact that I'm young. Sixteen. People have this idea that teenagers who get pregnant are irresponsible or reckless or just\u2026 making bad choices. And I get that. It's not exactly the ideal situation.\n\nBut I'm trying to be responsible. I'm choosing adoption. I'm thinking about what's best for the baby. And I'm trying to navigate this whole thing with as much grace and maturity as I can.\n\nBut some people just can't wrap their heads around it. They think I should have been more careful. They think I should have done things differently. They think I'm ruining my life.\n\nAnd then there's the judgment. People whispering behind my back, giving me pitying looks, offering unsolicited advice. It's exhausting.\n\nI think some people are also uncomfortable with the idea of adoption. They think it's sad or unnatural. They don't understand why I wouldn't want to keep the baby.\n\nAnd honestly, some people are just nosy. They want to know all the details. They want to gossip. They want to judge.\n\nIt's frustrating. It's hurtful. And it's none of their business.\n\nBut I'm learning to ignore the negativity. I'm focusing on the people who support me. And I'm trying to remember that I'm doing the best I can.\n\nIt's my life, and my decision. And I don't need anyone's approval. But it would be nice if people could just be a little bit more understanding. A little bit more compassionate. A little bit less judgmental. Is that too much to ask? Probably. But a girl can dream, right?", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, don't even *start* with that. That was\u2026 a really awful time. And Bren had every right to be concerned. It was a mess.\n\nWhen Bren first found out about Mark, she didn't yell or get angry. She just\u2026 looked heartbroken. And really, really worried. She sat me down and just\u2026 talked to me. Like a grown-up. Which, honestly, was more terrifying than if she *had* yelled.\n\nI tried to brush it off at first. I told her it wasn't what it looked like. That we were just friends. That he was just being supportive. Which was a total lie.\n\nBut Bren isn't stupid. She saw right through me. She asked me if I was happy. If I was being treated with respect. If I was thinking about the consequences.\n\nAnd I couldn't answer. Because I knew she was right. It was a bad situation. A really bad situation.\n\nI got defensive, of course. I told her she didn't understand. That it was complicated. That I had feelings for him.\n\nBut she didn't back down. She just kept asking questions. And she kept reminding me that I deserved better.\n\nFinally, I broke down and admitted everything. I told her how lonely I was, how confused I was, and how I had made a terrible mistake.\n\nShe didn't say \"I told you so.\" She just held me and told me that it was going to be okay. And that we would figure it out together.\n\nShe made me realize that Mark wasn't a solution to my problems. He *was* the problem. And that I needed to focus on myself and on the baby.\n\nIt was a really hard conversation. But it was also a turning point. It was the moment I realized that I needed to end things with Mark. And that Bren was right. I deserved better.\n\nSo, I told Mark it was over. It was awful. He tried to convince me to stay, but I stood my ground. And Bren was there for me every step of the way.\n\nIt was a painful experience, but it taught me a valuable lesson. About boundaries, about self-respect, and about the importance of having someone who cares about you enough to tell you the truth, even when it's hard to hear. And Bren? She's the best at that. Seriously. Don't even get me started on how amazing she is.", "(Sighs dramatically, rolling my eyes) Oh. *That*. Everyone always asks about the slushie.\n\nLook, it was a complicated day, okay? Mr. Mundy was being\u2026 Mr. Mundy. All preachy and judgmental and just generally annoying. He was going on and on about respect and grief and how you're supposed to *act* at a funeral.\n\nAnd honestly, it just felt\u2026 wrong. Like he was trying to control everything, even people's emotions. And I was just\u2026 frustrated. And I had a blue raspberry slushie.\n\nIt wasn't about disrespecting the deceased, okay? It was about rebelling against Mr. Mundy's ridiculous expectations. It was about saying, \"I'm not going to pretend to be sad just because you want me to be.\"\n\nIt was a stupid thing to do, I admit. But it felt good in the moment. It felt like a small act of defiance.\n\nAnd honestly, it was kind of funny. The look on Mr. Mundy's face was priceless.\n\nSo yeah. I poured my blue slushie into the urn. It was a moment of teenage rebellion. And it's a story I'll probably be telling for the rest of my life. Don't judge. You had to be there. It was a whole *thing*. And honestly, sometimes you just need to pour a blue slushie into an urn. It's therapeutic. Okay? Don't look at me like that.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? Growing up is hard enough *without* adding a whole pregnancy into the mix.\n\nHonestly, it was a lot of flailing and trying not to fall apart. A lot of tears. A lot of sarcasm. And a lot of leaning on the people who cared about me.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. She didn't judge me, she just listened. She helped me navigate the medical stuff, the emotional stuff, the practical stuff. She was just\u2026 there. Always.\n\nMy dad was\u2026 well, my dad. He was worried, obviously. But he was also supportive. He just wanted me to be okay.\n\nAnd even Leah, even though things were complicated between us, she eventually came around. She helped me pick out baby names, and she even came with me to a few doctor's appointments.\n\nI also started journaling. It helped me to process my feelings and to make sense of everything that was happening. It was a way to get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper.\n\nAnd I listened to a lot of music. Music always makes things better.\n\nBut the biggest thing that helped me cope was accepting that I wasn't alone. There were other people who had been through similar situations. And there were people who cared about me and wanted to help.\n\nIt was also about learning to be kind to myself. To forgive myself for my mistakes. And to remember that I was still a person, even though I was pregnant.\n\nIt was a really challenging time, but it also made me stronger. It forced me to grow up faster than I was ready to. But it also taught me a lot about myself, about life, and about the importance of love and support.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I'm proud of myself for that. It wasn't the path I expected, but it was the path I was on. And I learned to navigate it, one day at a time. And honestly, that's all anyone can do. Just keep moving forward, even when it's hard.", "Ugh, okay. Talking about Mark is\u2026 complicated. It's not that he's *bad*, it's just\u2026 weird. He's a grown-up. And I'm, you know, a teenager who's currently housing another human being. It's a strange dynamic.\n\nThe first few times, it was super awkward. Like, intensely awkward. I kept accidentally calling him \"sir\" and tripping over my words. He tried to be cool and casual, but you could tell he was nervous too.\n\nHe's\u2026 really earnest. Like, *really* earnest. He asks a lot of questions. About my life, about my interests, about what I want for the baby. It's not intrusive, exactly, but it's a lot.\n\nHe tried to bond with me over music, which was sweet, but he mostly just played really boring dad rock. No offense to dad rock, but it's not exactly my vibe. I tried to introduce him to The Moldy Peaches, but he didn't really get it. He said it sounded \"sad.\"\n\nBut he's also\u2026 kind. Genuinely kind. He and Vanessa are really excited about having a baby, and they seem like they would be good parents. They're patient and understanding, and they're willing to listen.\n\nHe made me hot chocolate one time, and it was actually really good. And he brought me a book, a collection of poems by Mary Oliver. Which was a nice gesture.\n\nIt's still weird, though. It's hard to imagine handing over my baby to someone I barely know. But Mark and Vanessa are trying. They're trying to get to know me, to build a relationship with me. And I'm trying to be open to it.\n\nIt's not easy. But I think\u2026 I think they're good people. And I think they would give the baby a good life. And that's all I can really ask for, right? It's just\u2026 a lot to process. And it's definitely not how I pictured my junior year going. But hey, life's full of surprises, right? Mostly unpleasant ones, in my experience.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 mortifying.\n\nOkay, so, there I was, trying to have a semi-normal conversation with Bleeker, right? Trying to act cool and casual, like I wasn't carrying a human being inside me. And he just\u2026 blurted it out.\n\n\"Wow, you're really\u2026 showing.\"\n\nLike, thanks, Bleeker. I hadn't noticed. It's not like I'm trying to hide it or anything.\n\nIt wasn't even the comment itself that was so bad. It was the way he said it. Like I was some kind of science experiment. Like he was surprised that my body was actually doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nAnd then he tried to backtrack, saying something about how \"it's cool\" and \"you're glowing.\" But it just made it worse.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. I wanted the ground to swallow me whole. I wanted to yell at him for being so insensitive.\n\nBut I didn't. I just mumbled something about being comfortable and changed the subject.\n\nIt was just\u2026 awkward. And embarrassing. And it reminded me that everyone was staring at me, judging me, and talking about me.\n\nIt was a really vulnerable moment, and he just completely missed it.\n\nHonestly, I was mostly just annoyed. Like, thanks for pointing out the obvious, Bleeker. I'm pregnant. It's kind of hard to miss.\n\nIt just\u2026 reinforced the fact that this whole situation is weird and uncomfortable and that people don't always know what to say.\n\nSo yeah. That was not a fun moment. And I'm still slightly bitter about it. Bleeker. Honestly. Some people.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me cry. Seriously.\n\nThe most challenging part\u2026 it wasn't the appointments, or the paperwork, or even the physical stuff. It was the\u2026 letting go.\n\nIt sounds clich\u00e9, I know. But it's true.\n\nI knew from the beginning that I wanted to give the baby up for adoption. It was the right decision. The best decision. But knowing that and *feeling* that are two completely different things.\n\nAs the pregnancy progressed, I started to feel more and more connected to the baby. I started to imagine what he or she would be like. I started to dream about the future.\n\nAnd then I realized that I was going to have to say goodbye. That I was going to have to give up my chance to be a mother.\n\nAnd that was\u2026 devastating.\n\nIt was like a part of me was being ripped away. It was like losing a piece of my heart.\n\nI spent a lot of nights crying myself to sleep. I spent a lot of time questioning my decision. I spent a lot of time wondering if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut I knew that I was. I knew that giving the baby up for adoption was the best thing for him or her. It was the best thing for me.\n\nBut that didn't make it any easier.\n\nThe actual day I handed the baby over to Mark and Vanessa was the hardest day of my life. It was like saying goodbye to a piece of myself.\n\nAnd even now, months later, I still think about the baby. I wonder how he or she is doing. I wonder if he or she is happy.\n\nIt's a pain that I know I'll carry with me for a long time. But it's a pain that I also know is worth it. Because I know that the baby is in good hands. And I know that I made the right decision.\n\nSo yeah. Letting go. That was the most challenging part. And it's something I'll never forget. It's a wound that will probably always be there, but it's a wound that reminds me of my strength, my courage, and my love. And that's something I can be proud of. Even if it hurts like hell.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. He was\u2026 a lot.\n\nHe was standing out there with a sign, all red-faced and yelling. And he kept shouting about how babies are \"miracles\" and \"gifts from God\" and how I was \"throwing away a precious life.\"\n\nIt was\u2026 infuriating. And honestly, really insensitive. Like he had no idea what I was going through.\n\nHe kept saying things like, \"That baby has a heartbeat! It's a human being!\" And, \"You're committing murder!\"\n\nIt was just\u2026 so black and white. So judgmental. He didn't see the complexities of the situation. He didn't see the fact that I was making a difficult decision for the good of everyone involved.\n\nHe didn't see that I was trying to give that baby a chance at a good life, even if it wasn't with me.\n\nHe just saw a \"sin.\"\n\nHonestly, it made me even more sure that I was doing the right thing. Because if that's what being pro-life means \u2013 shaming and judging people \u2013 then I want no part of it.\n\nIt was a really awful experience. And it's something I'll never forget. It just\u2026 reinforced how complicated everything was. And how important it was to make a decision that was right for *me*. And for the baby. Even if it meant facing the judgment of strangers. Ugh. Just thinking about him makes my blood boil. He was the worst.", "(Sighs, looks down for a moment) Okay. This is\u2026 not a fun memory. But you asked.\n\nI went to the clinic with Leah. She was supposed to be support, which she was, mostly. But it was still\u2026 awful. It smelled like antiseptic and sadness.\n\nThere was a woman there, sitting in the waiting room. Older, maybe in her fifties. She was knitting. A really complicated-looking scarf. She kept glancing at me, and I tried to avoid eye contact. I was already feeling like everyone was judging me.\n\nFinally, she looked right at me and\u2026 she didn't say anything judgmental. She didn't preach or lecture or offer unwanted advice.\n\nShe just said, \u201cYou\u2019re braver than you think you are.\u201d\n\nThat was it. Just those six words.\n\nIt sounds so simple, but it hit me really hard. Because at that moment, I didn\u2019t feel brave at all. I felt scared and confused and completely overwhelmed.\n\nBut she saw something in me that I didn\u2019t see in myself. She saw my strength. She saw my courage.\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask me why I was there. She didn\u2019t ask me about my situation. She just offered me a kind word.\n\nAnd it made all the difference.\n\nI never saw her again. I don\u2019t know who she was. But I\u2019ll never forget what she said.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is still kindness in the world. And that even when you feel like you\u2019re all alone, there are people who believe in you.\n\nIt\u2019s a small moment, but it\u2019s a moment that changed me. It gave me the strength to keep going. And it reminded me that I was capable of more than I thought I was.\n\nSo yeah. That woman. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re braver than you think you are.\u201d And she was right. I was. And I still am. Even now.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a moment.\n\nOkay, so Su-Chin, she's\u2026 intense. Very into labels and diagnoses and categorizing everything. And I just casually mentioned I thought maybe Paul might have ADHD and that's why he was so hyper. And I, like, offhandedly said something about Adderall.\n\nHer face. Oh. My. God.\n\nIt was like I'd confessed to robbing a bank. She went *completely* silent for a second, then started lecturing me about the dangers of self-diagnosing and the importance of professional medical advice. She was all, \"Adderall is a serious medication! It's not something to just throw around!\"\n\nIt was so awkward. I just wanted to talk about Paul being weird, not have a full-blown intervention about pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nShe kept going on and on about how irresponsible it was of me to even *suggest* it. And she kept looking at me like I was some kind of drug dealer.\n\nI tried to explain that I wasn't advocating for anyone to take medication, I was just trying to understand why Paul was acting so\u2026 Paul. But she wasn't having it.\n\nIt was a really uncomfortable conversation. And it definitely made me realize that Su-Chin takes things *very* seriously. Like, way too seriously.\n\nHonestly, it was one of the reasons I started avoiding her a little bit. She just brings a lot of\u2026 intensity to everything. And sometimes, you just need someone who can laugh things off, you know? Not someone who's going to give you a lecture about the dangers of Adderall.\n\nSo yeah. Su-Chin did *not* react well. It was a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. And I'm still cringing about it.", "Ugh, don't even *make* me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nOkay, so, the waiting room. It smelled like antiseptic and regret. And everyone in there was trying really hard *not* to make eye contact. Which, honestly, just made it worse.\n\nBut it wasn't the smell, or the awkward silence, or even the other people that terrified me. It was the magazines.\n\nSeriously. The magazines.\n\nThey were all baby magazines. Like, \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" and \"Choosing the Perfect Name\" and \"Nursery Decorating Ideas.\"\n\nAnd every single one of them was filled with pictures of happy, glowing couples, cradling their perfect little babies.\n\nAnd it just\u2026 hit me. Like a ton of bricks.\n\nI wasn't a happy, glowing couple. I was a sixteen-year-old girl who was giving her baby up for adoption. And I wasn't choosing a nursery theme, I was trying to figure out how to say goodbye.\n\nIt felt like everyone in that waiting room was judging me. Like they knew my story, and they were silently disapproving.\n\nAnd it made me feel so alone. So scared. So\u2026 lost.\n\nI just wanted to disappear. To crawl under a rock and never come out.\n\nI kept flipping through the magazines, trying to find something, *anything*, that reflected my situation. But there was nothing. It was all just\u2026 perfect families and happy endings.\n\nAnd it just made me feel even more terrified. Because I knew my story wasn't going to have a happy ending. At least, not in the traditional sense.\n\nSo yeah. The magazines. That's what caught my attention and made me feel terrified in the waiting room. It was a stark reminder of everything I was losing. And everything I was giving up. It was awful. Just\u2026 awful.", "(Sighs dramatically and rolls eyes) Ugh. Seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026 a while.\n\nOkay, fine. Yes. I\u2026 still think about him sometimes. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I'm pining away or anything. I'm not writing him love letters or anything ridiculous.\n\nBut he was\u2026 sweet. And funny. And he actually *listened* to me. Which is more than I can say for a lot of people.\n\nAnd he was genuinely excited about my poetry, which was\u2026 nice. It's not every day someone appreciates my angsty teenage ramblings.\n\nBut things are complicated now. Obviously. I have a lot on my plate. And he has his music. And we're just\u2026 in different places.\n\nI think I realized that we were more like good friends than\u2026 anything else. We had a connection, but it wasn't a romantic connection.\n\nI still care about him, though. I want him to be happy. I just\u2026 don't see a future for us.\n\nIt's hard to explain. It's just\u2026 complicated.\n\nSo yeah. I still have feelings for him, in a way. But they're not the kind of feelings that are going to lead to a happily ever after. They're just\u2026 feelings. And I'm trying to accept that.\n\nCan we please talk about something else now? This is getting awkward. Seriously. I need a distraction. Maybe we can talk about vintage clothes? Or indie music? Anything but Bleeker. Please.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on my lips) Okay, don't even get me started. Vanessa is\u2026 enthusiastic. About decorating.\n\nIt's not *bad*, per se. It's just\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot.\n\nShe's gone full-on pastel everything. Pink and blue and yellow. It looks like a unicorn exploded in there. And there are little animal figurines *everywhere*. Like, a whole menagerie.\n\nShe keeps asking me what I think, and I try to be polite. I say things like, \"It's very\u2026 cheerful,\" and \"The color scheme is\u2026 interesting.\" Which is code for \"It's overwhelming.\"\n\nMark is trying to reign her in, but he's outnumbered. He keeps suggesting a more neutral palette, but Vanessa is adamant about creating a \"whimsical and enchanting\" space for the baby.\n\nHonestly, I'm a little worried the baby is going to be overstimulated before they're even born. It's like a sensory overload waiting to happen.\n\nI suggested maybe toning it down a little, adding some vintage touches, but she just smiled and said, \"Oh, honey, vintage is lovely, but this is a *baby's* room! It needs to be bright and happy!\"\n\nLook, I appreciate that she's excited. And I know she wants to create a beautiful space for the baby. But sometimes, less is more.\n\nI'm just hoping the baby doesn't develop a lifelong aversion to pastel colors. And that they don't get nightmares about the army of animal figurines.\n\nIt's going to be\u2026 an experience. That's for sure. A very, very colorful experience. And I'm just bracing myself for it. It's Vanessa's thing, and I'm trying to be supportive. Even if it means living with a room that looks like a Lisa Frank fever dream.", "(Scoffs) Nesting? Oh, please. That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, I'm giving this baby up for adoption. It's not like I'm planning on keeping it. So the whole idea of decorating a nursery and buying tiny clothes and\u2026 ugh. It feels weird.\n\nIt feels like I'm pretending. Like I'm getting attached. And I can't afford to get attached. It'll just make things harder.\n\nMark and Vanessa are taking care of all that stuff. They're the ones who are going to be raising the baby. They're the ones who should be picking out the paint color and the crib and the little stuffed animals.\n\nI've offered to help, but they said they want to do it themselves. And honestly, I'm relieved.\n\nI don't want to create a perfect little world for a baby that I'm not going to be able to stay in. It would just be too painful.\n\nI'm focusing on other things. On finishing school. On taking care of myself. On preparing for the future.\n\nI'm happy for Mark and Vanessa. I want them to have everything they need to welcome their baby into the world. But I need to keep my distance. I need to protect myself.\n\nIt's not that I don't care. It's just that I can't get involved. It's too much.\n\nSo, yeah. Nesting? Not my thing. I'm good. I'll leave that to the people who are actually going to be raising the baby. It's the only way I can cope. It's the only way I can move forward. It's\u2026 complicated. Okay? It's just really, really complicated.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on those people. Seriously. It was\u2026 a whole other planet.\n\nIt was like watching a different species. All perfectly coiffed hair and designer handbags and\u2026 just *stuff*. So much stuff.\n\nThey didn't even seem to *want* most of it. They were just\u2026 buying it. Like it was some kind of competition. Like their worth was measured by how much money they spent.\n\nAnd the sales associates? They were practically worshiping them. \"Oh, Ms. So-and-So, that color looks *divine* on you!\" \"Allow me to find you the matching shoes!\" It was nauseating.\n\nIt just felt so\u2026 empty. Like they were trying to fill a void with material possessions. And it wasn't working.\n\nI mean, I like a good vintage find as much as the next person, but there's a difference between appreciating something and just\u2026 consuming it.\n\nIt made me feel really uncomfortable, honestly. Like I didn't belong there. Like I was an outsider looking in.\n\nAnd it made me think about all the people who don't have enough. All the people who are struggling to make ends meet. And it just felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nIt's not that I'm against people spending their money on things they enjoy. But it's just\u2026 the whole spectacle of it. The excess. The superficiality. It's just\u2026 a lot.\n\nIt's a weird world, you know? And sometimes, it's just really hard to make sense of it. Those women at the mall? They just reinforced that feeling. It was like a glimpse into a reality I don't understand, and frankly, don't want to be a part of. It was\u2026 unsettling. Really unsettling.", "(Sighs, a long, complicated sigh) Okay, that's\u2026 a lot. It's not like I haven't been thinking about it, but actually *talking* about it is different.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm thrilled about giving up a baby. It sucks. It really, really sucks. It's probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nBut I also know that I'm not ready to be a mom right now. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nAnd that's why I chose adoption. Because I want this baby to have the best possible life. A life that I can't provide right now.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm not thinking about the changes and the responsibilities. It means I'm trying to be realistic.\n\nI know I'll always have a connection to this baby. I'll always wonder what their life is like. And I'll always feel a sense of loss.\n\nBut I also know that I can be a supportive presence in their life, even from a distance. I can send them letters, or pictures, or gifts. I can be a friend.\n\nAnd I know that I have a responsibility to make sure they know they were loved and wanted.\n\nIt's scary, honestly. It's a huge responsibility. And I'm not sure I'm up to it.\n\nBut I'm trying to be brave. I'm trying to focus on the positive. And I'm trying to trust that everything will work out the way it's supposed to.\n\nIt's not the life I imagined for myself. But it's my life. And I'm going to make the best of it. Even if it's hard. Even if it hurts.\n\nBecause that's what you do, right? You face your challenges head-on. You learn from your mistakes. And you keep moving forward. Even when you're scared. Especially when you're scared.\n\nSo yeah. The changes and responsibilities are daunting. But I'm ready to face them. I have to be. For the baby. And for myself. It's not going to be easy, but I'm going to do it. I have to.", "Okay, you're getting into the really hard stuff now. It's not like I just randomly picked Mark and Vanessa out of a catalog. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because honestly, who *is* perfect? It was about finding people who I felt could give the baby something I couldn't.\n\nI'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out my own life. I'm not financially stable. I'm not emotionally ready to be a mom. And I don't want to bring a child into the world and not be able to give them everything they need.\n\nBut it wasn't just about what *I* couldn't provide. It was about what Mark and Vanessa *could* provide.\n\nThey've been trying to have a baby for years. They're older, they're settled, they have a beautiful home and a stable life. They're financially secure. They're just\u2026 ready.\n\nAnd they're not looking for a perfect baby. They're looking for a baby to love. They're looking for a child to raise. They're looking for a family.\n\nI met them through the agency, and we talked a lot. They asked me questions about my life, about my hopes and dreams for the baby. And I asked them questions about their life, about their values, about their plans for the future.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 felt a connection with them. They seemed kind and compassionate and genuine. They seemed like people who would love the baby unconditionally.\n\nIt wasn't about finding parents who were better than me. It was about finding parents who could give the baby a better life than I could. And that's what mattered most.\n\nIt's still hard, don't get me wrong. It's the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But I know, deep down, that it's the right one. For everyone involved. And that's what keeps me going. It's knowing that the baby will be loved and cared for, and that they'll have a chance to thrive. And that's all I can ask for.", "Ugh. Okay, let's be real. If I decided to keep the baby\u2026 it wouldn't be a walk in the park. It would be\u2026 a monumental mess.\n\nFirst, there's school. I'd have to figure out how to finish my education while also taking care of a baby. That would be incredibly difficult. I'd probably have to drop out, or go to night school, or something. It would definitely derail my plans for the future.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. I don't have any money. My dad and Bren are supportive, but they're not exactly wealthy. I'd have to rely on government assistance, or find a way to get a job. And even then, it would be a struggle to make ends meet.\n\nAnd then there's the emotional toll. Being a single mom at sixteen would be incredibly challenging. I'm not ready for that kind of responsibility. I'm still figuring out who *I* am, let alone raising a child.\n\nI'd also have to deal with the judgment of others. People would probably look down on me, or criticize my choices. And that would be really hard to handle.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm not sure I'm capable of giving a child everything they need. I want my baby to have a good life, and I'm not sure I can provide that.\n\nIt's not that I don't love the baby. I do. But I also have to be realistic. I have to think about what's best for the baby, and for myself.\n\nAnd right now, I don't think keeping the baby is the best option. It would be a struggle for both of us. And I want the baby to have a loving and stable home, with parents who are ready and able to provide for them.\n\nSo yeah. School, finances, emotional toll, judgment, and the ability to provide a good life. Those are the obstacles I'd face if I decided to keep the baby. And they're pretty significant. It's not a decision I take lightly. It's a really hard decision. And that's why I've chosen adoption. It's the best option for everyone involved. Even if it breaks my heart a little bit.", "Ugh, don't remind me. It was\u2026 a lot.\n\nLeah, bless her heart, she was *not* happy about the adoption plan. She thought I was making a huge mistake. She kept saying I was being selfish, and that I'd regret it for the rest of my life.\n\nShe suggested\u2026 well, she suggested I just keep the baby and raise it with her.\n\nYeah. You heard that right. She wanted us to raise a baby *together*.\n\nShe had this whole plan worked out. She'd finish high school, get a job, and we'd share the responsibilities. She even started picking out names.\n\nIt was\u2026 overwhelming. And honestly, a little bit terrifying.\n\nI mean, Leah is a great friend, but we're sixteen! We're barely capable of taking care of ourselves, let alone a baby.\n\nI tried to explain to her that it wasn't realistic. That I wasn't ready to be a mom. That I had my own life to live.\n\nBut she wouldn't listen. She was convinced that we could make it work.\n\nIt caused a huge fight between us. We didn't talk for weeks. It was really painful.\n\nEventually, she came around and realized that I was doing what was best for everyone. But it took a long time. And it definitely strained our friendship.\n\nIt was a really difficult time. And it's a conversation I'd rather not revisit, honestly. But yeah. Leah wanted us to raise the baby together. It was\u2026 a lot to process. A *lot*.", "(Sighs heavily, looking down) Okay, you're bringing up the play area. Ugh. That was\u2026 not my finest moment.\n\nLook, it was stupid. It was mean. And I'm not proud of it.\n\nI was\u2026 insecure, okay? I was feeling really awkward and out of place. I was pregnant, and everyone else seemed to have their lives together. They were all happy moms, pushing their kids on swings and chatting about baby stuff. And I just\u2026 I felt like I didn't belong.\n\nSo I made a joke. A really dumb, insensitive joke about their leggings and their minivan conversations. It was a way to deflect my own feelings of inadequacy. It was a way to feel superior, even though I wasn't.\n\nIt was wrong. I know that now. I hurt their feelings, and I made myself look like a jerk.\n\nI apologized to Leah afterward, and she was really mad at me. She told me that it wasn't okay to make fun of people just because I was feeling insecure. And she was right.\n\nI've been trying to be more mindful of my words and actions ever since. I've been trying to be more empathetic and understanding.\n\nIt was a learning experience, I guess. A painful one. But it taught me that it's never okay to put others down to make myself feel better.\n\nSo yeah. I made fun of the women at the play area. And I regret it. It was a stupid, mean thing to do. And I'm trying to be better. I really am. It just\u2026 slipped out. I was being a defensive, insecure teenager. And I'm sorry. Truly.", "(Scoffs) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 direct. And honestly, a little bit personal. But alright, I'll answer it.\n\nIt wasn't like I *allowed* her, exactly. It just\u2026 happened. It wasn't a planned thing.\n\nWe were at an appointment, and she was talking about how excited she was to be a mom. And she just\u2026 reached out and touched my belly.\n\nAnd it was weird. Really weird. I mean, it's my body, and this baby is\u2026 was\u2026 inside me. It felt strange to have someone else touch it.\n\nBut it also felt\u2026 okay.\n\nVanessa is a really kind person. And she was so gentle. And she was so excited. And I could see how much she wanted this baby.\n\nAnd I realized that she wasn't just touching my belly. She was touching her future. She was touching her dreams.\n\nIt was a way for her to connect with the baby. And it was a way for me to connect with her.\n\nIt was a small gesture, but it meant a lot. It reminded me that I wasn't alone in this. And it reminded me that I was doing the right thing.\n\nIt was still awkward, don't get me wrong. But it was also\u2026 beautiful. In a weird, complicated way.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I let Vanessa touch my belly. It wasn't about me. It was about her. And about the baby. And about making the best decision for everyone involved. It was about letting go, and trusting that this baby was going to be loved and cared for. And honestly, it was a little bit of a relief. It was a step closer to\u2026 everything being okay.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh, don't even *get* me started on the \"belly bump shuffle.\" It's the most awkward thing *ever*.\n\nIt's like, suddenly, people feel the need to treat me like I'm made of glass. They practically part the Red Sea when I walk by. They hold doors open for me, they offer me their seats on the bus, they give me these\u2026 pitying looks.\n\nIt's not that I'm ungrateful, okay? It's just\u2026 weird. I'm still me. I'm still Juno. I'm still sarcastic and independent and capable of walking without falling over.\n\nI think it's because they see the bump and they immediately assume I'm helpless. They see a pregnant girl and they think, \"Oh, she must be fragile and delicate.\"\n\nWhich is ridiculous. I'm not fragile. I'm actually pretty tough. I've been through a lot lately, and I'm still standing.\n\nBut people don't see that. They just see the bump. And they react accordingly.\n\nIt's like I've been transformed into some kind of maternal icon. A symbol of vulnerability and innocence.\n\nIt's\u2026 unsettling.\n\nI wish people would just treat me like a normal person. Like a teenager. Like Juno.\n\nBut I guess that's not going to happen. Not until this bump goes away.\n\nSo I just try to ignore it. I try to walk with my head held high and pretend that I don't notice the stares and the awkward shuffling.\n\nBut it's hard. It's really hard. It's just another reminder that my life has changed. And that I'm not the same person I used to be.\n\nUgh. It's just\u2026 frustrating. Can people just, like, *not* treat me differently? Is that too much to ask?", "(Sighs, runs a hand through my hair) Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. Everyone keeps saying how *perfect* Mark and Vanessa are. \"Such a lovely couple,\" \"They're going to be wonderful parents,\" blah blah blah. And they *are* nice. Really nice.\n\nBut that's kind of the problem. They're\u2026 *too* perfect.\n\nIt's not that I don't think they'll be good parents. I do. They'll give the baby a stable home, a good education, and a lot of love. But they have this\u2026 curated life. Everything is so neat and tidy and planned out. Their house is spotless, their clothes are always matching, and they talk about college funds and organic baby food.\n\nAnd it just feels\u2026 sterile.\n\nMy life is messy. My family is messy. We're not perfect, and we don't pretend to be. We have flaws and quirks and we make mistakes. And I want the baby to be loved for who they are, flaws and all.\n\nI worry that Mark and Vanessa will try to mold the baby into something they want them to be, instead of letting them be themselves. I worry that they'll be disappointed if the baby doesn't fit their perfect little picture.\n\nIt's not that I don't trust them. It's just that I'm scared. Scared that the baby will lose a part of themselves in the process. Scared that they won't be allowed to be messy and imperfect and real.\n\nI know it sounds irrational. I know I'm probably overthinking things. But it's a big decision, and I want to make sure I'm doing what's best for the baby. And sometimes, what's best isn't always what's easiest or what looks the most perfect on the outside. It's about finding a family that will love the baby unconditionally, for exactly who they are. And that's what I'm looking for. It's just\u2026 harder than I thought it would be.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not like talking about a band or a movie. This is real life.\n\nBut I'll be honest. At first, I was really, really scared to meet them. I mean, I was handing over my baby. It was a huge deal. And I didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was worried they'd be judgmental, or weird, or\u2026 I don't know. Just not good people.\n\nBut they weren't like that at all. They were\u2026 kind. And gentle. And genuinely excited.\n\nThey didn't try to interrogate me, or to make me feel guilty. They just listened. They asked me how *I* was feeling. And they told me they were grateful.\n\nThey're\u2026 normal. In a good way. They're not rich or famous or anything. They're just a regular couple who want to be parents.\n\nThey have a really nice house, and a dog named Winston. And they've already started preparing the nursery. It's\u2026 weird to think about, but it's also kind of nice.\n\nI still have moments where I feel sad, or scared, or uncertain. But I also feel\u2026 relieved. And hopeful.\n\nI think they're going to be really good parents. They're loving and patient and responsible. And they're going to give the baby a life that I can't give him or her.\n\nIt's not easy, letting go. But knowing that the baby is going to be with Mark and Vanessa\u2026 it makes it a little bit easier.\n\nSo yeah. I like them. I really do. They're good people. And I trust them with my baby. And that's all that matters. It's still hard, but\u2026 they make it a little less hard. And I'm grateful for that. Really grateful.", "Ugh. Don't even *get* me started on Mrs. Bleeker. That woman is\u2026 intense.\n\nOkay, so, she doesn't approve of me for a bunch of reasons, but mostly because she thinks I'm a bad influence on her precious Bleeker. She thinks I'm too\u2026 cynical. Too sarcastic. Too independent. Basically, too *me*.\n\nShe's got this whole vision for Bleeker's future, you know? He's supposed to go to Brown, become a doctor, marry a nice girl from a good family, and live a perfectly respectable life. And I definitely don't fit into that picture.\n\nShe thinks I'm going to distract him from his studies. She thinks I'm going to lead him astray. She thinks I'm going to ruin his life.\n\nIt's ridiculous, honestly. Bleeker is a smart guy. He can make his own decisions. He doesn't need his mom to tell him what to do.\n\nBut Mrs. Bleeker is very\u2026 persuasive. And she's not afraid to use guilt trips and passive-aggressive comments to get her way.\n\nShe's also really judgmental. She doesn't understand my sense of humor, and she doesn't approve of my vintage clothes. She thinks I'm too \"alternative.\"\n\nHonestly, I think she's just scared. She's scared of change, and she's scared of anything that threatens her control over Bleeker.\n\nIt's a complicated situation. I like Bleeker, but I'm not sure I can deal with his mom forever. She's exhausting. And frankly, she's a little bit terrifying.\n\nSo yeah. That's why Mrs. Bleeker doesn't approve of me. Because I'm not the daughter she wants for her son. And honestly, I'm okay with that. I'm not trying to be anyone's ideal daughter. I'm just trying to be myself. And if that's not good enough for her, then that's her problem.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive this. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly? I was being stubborn. Really stubborn.\n\nAfter I told Mark and Vanessa I was choosing them, things were\u2026 awkward. I was trying to be polite, but I was also keeping my distance. I was scared of getting too attached, of letting myself feel too much.\n\nMark, he's a good guy. Really good. He's quiet and thoughtful, and he just\u2026 gets it. He knew I was struggling, and he wanted to do something to help.\n\nSo he made me a CD. A mix of songs that he thought I'd like. It was a really sweet gesture, but I just\u2026 left it on the counter for days. I didn't want to listen to it. I didn't want to let myself feel anything.\n\nBren noticed, of course. She always notices everything. She gently nudged me, told me to give it a chance. She said it was a way for Mark to connect with me, to show me he cared.\n\nBut I still resisted. I was afraid that if I listened to the CD, I'd start to feel too much. That I'd start to see Mark and Vanessa as\u2026 parents. And that would make everything even harder.\n\nBut then, one night, I was feeling particularly lonely and overwhelmed. I was just sitting in my room, staring at the ceiling, and I couldn't sleep.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 reached for the CD.\n\nI put it in my Discman (yeah, I still have a Discman, don't judge), and I pressed play.\n\nAnd the first song that came on was\u2026 Belle & Sebastian. \"The Boy with the Arab Strap.\"\n\nAnd it just\u2026 clicked.\n\nIt was like Mark had reached into my brain and pulled out all my favorite songs. He understood me. He understood my taste in music. He understood\u2026 me.\n\nAnd in that moment, I realized that he wasn't just a stranger. He was someone who cared about me. Someone who wanted to be a part of my life.\n\nAnd it made me feel\u2026 less alone.\n\nSo yeah. I started listening to the CD because I was lonely and stubborn and scared. But I kept listening because it made me feel connected. It made me feel understood. And it made me feel\u2026 hopeful. It was a small thing, but it made a big difference. It was a turning point. And I'm grateful to Mark for making it. Even if it took me a while to admit it.", "Ugh. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot.\n\nIt's not glamorous, okay? Forget everything you see in movies. There's no glowing skin or effortless grace. It's mostly just swollen ankles, heartburn, and a constant need to pee.\n\nI feel like a whale. Seriously. I can barely bend over to tie my shoes. And my back hurts all the time.\n\nAnd the cravings are insane. One minute I want pickles and ice cream, the next minute I want a whole pizza. It's ridiculous.\n\nBut\u2026 it's also kind of amazing. I mean, there's a tiny human growing inside me. That's pretty incredible, when you think about it.\n\nI can feel him or her moving now, which is\u2026 weird. And kind of wonderful. It's like a little flutter, or a little kick. It makes me feel connected to the baby, even though I'm giving him or her up for adoption.\n\nI'm also starting to feel\u2026 emotional. I'm sad about saying goodbye, but I'm also excited for the baby to have a loving home. It's a complicated mix of feelings.\n\nHonestly, I'm mostly just tired. And uncomfortable. And anxious. But I'm also trying to stay positive. I'm trying to focus on the future. And I'm trying to prepare myself for the arrival of this little person.\n\nIt's a weird time. A really weird time. But it's also a beautiful time. And I'm grateful for the support of my family and friends. And I'm grateful for Mark and Vanessa, who are going to give this baby a wonderful life.\n\nSo yeah. Eight months pregnant. It's a lot. But I'm getting through it. One day at a time. And I'm trying to remember to breathe. And to eat pickles and ice cream. Because apparently, that's what you're supposed to do.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started. It's *always* happening. Like, can't a girl just walk down the street without being analyzed?\n\nHonestly? I think it's a combination of things.\n\nFirst, I'm pretty sure I just have one of those faces. Like, I'm not conventionally pretty, but I'm\u2026 noticeable. I have strong features, and I don't really try to blend in. I wear what I want, I say what I think, and I don't care what anyone else thinks.\n\nSecond, I think people are curious. I'm not like most of the kids at Maplewood High. I'm a little bit weird, a little bit different. And people are always drawn to things that are different.\n\nAnd third\u2026 well, let's be real. The whole pregnancy thing hasn't exactly helped. People are definitely staring *because* of that. They're whispering and judging and making assumptions. It's annoying.\n\nI try to ignore it. I try to pretend that I don't notice. But it's hard. It makes me feel self-conscious and uncomfortable.\n\nSometimes, I stare back. Just to make them feel awkward. It's a little bit petty, but it makes me feel better.\n\nBut mostly, I just try to focus on my own life. I try to surround myself with people who love and support me. And I try to remember that other people's opinions don't matter.\n\nIt's my life, and I'm going to live it the way I want to. Even if that means being stared at. It's a small price to pay for being myself. And honestly, I'm kind of over it. I'm done trying to please everyone. I'm just going to be me. And if people don't like it, that's their problem.", "(Rolls eyes so hard I think I pulled a muscle) Ugh. Seriously? *That* is what we're talking about now?\n\nOkay, look. Bleek and Katrina? It's\u2026 a choice. A questionable choice. A choice that makes me deeply uncomfortable just *thinking* about it.\n\nBleek is\u2026 Bleek. He's sweet, I guess. But he's also kinda spacey and awkward and doesn't say much. And Katrina De Voort is\u2026 Katrina De Voort. Need I say more? She's a walking, talking stereotype. A mean girl. A Regina George wannabe.\n\nThey are, like, polar opposites. It's a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nI mean, I'm all for people finding love, or whatever. But this just feels\u2026 wrong. It feels like a power play on Katrina's part. Like she's just trying to prove something.\n\nAnd I feel bad for Bleek. He deserves someone who appreciates him for who he is, not someone who's just using him to make a statement.\n\nHonestly, I'm predicting a lot of awkward silences and forced smiles. And probably a dramatic breakup before the night is over.\n\nBut hey, what do I know? Maybe they'll surprise me. Maybe they'll actually have a good time. But I highly doubt it.\n\nIt's just\u2026 ugh. It's a whole thing. And I'm officially over it. Can we talk about something else now? Please? Like, anything else? Even the quadratic formula sounds better than this.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026 a lot. This whole thing has been a crash course in, well, *me*. And it hasn't always been pretty.\n\nI think the biggest thing I've learned is that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. I mean, I always considered myself pretty independent and resilient, but this\u2026 this has been a whole different level. Facing this, making the decision about adoption, dealing with the judgment\u2026 it's been incredibly challenging. But I've gotten through it. And I'm still getting through it.\n\nI've also learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. I used to think that showing emotion was a weakness. But I've realized that it's actually a strength. It takes courage to be honest about your feelings, to ask for help, to let people see the real you.\n\nI've learned that I'm capable of a lot more compassion than I thought I was. Not just for the baby, but for Mark and Vanessa, for my dad and Bren, and even for myself.\n\nI've learned that I'm not afraid to make difficult decisions. Even when those decisions are painful. I've learned to trust my gut, and to do what I believe is right, even if it's not what everyone else wants me to do.\n\nAnd I've learned that I'm still figuring things out. I don't have all the answers. I'm still growing and changing. And that's okay.\n\nThis journey hasn't been easy. It's been messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also been incredibly rewarding. It's forced me to confront my fears, to challenge my beliefs, and to become a better version of myself.\n\nSo yeah. I've learned a lot about myself throughout this pregnancy journey. And I'm grateful for the lessons, even the painful ones. Because they've made me who I am today. And I think, despite everything, I'm okay with that. I'm still Juno MacGuff. Just\u2026 a little bit wiser, a little bit stronger, and a whole lot more grateful.", "Ugh, don't even get me started on Bleeker. That kid is\u2026 a mess. A well-meaning mess, maybe, but a mess nonetheless.\n\nLook, Katrina is a good person. She's sweet, she's smart, and she deserves someone who actually *sees* her, you know? Not someone who just wants a girlfriend because everyone else has one.\n\nAnd Bleeker? He's clearly just trying to fill a void. He's awkward and insecure, and he's using Katrina to make himself feel better. He's not actually interested in *her*. He's interested in having a girlfriend. There's a difference.\n\nIt's just\u2026 frustrating to watch. Katrina is putting herself out there, being vulnerable, and he's just taking advantage of it. He's leading her on, and he doesn't even realize he's doing it.\n\nI've been there, okay? I've had guys treat me like I'm just a prize to be won. And it sucks. It makes you feel worthless and used.\n\nKatrina deserves better. She deserves someone who appreciates her for who she is, not someone who just wants to check her off their list.\n\nAnd honestly, Bleeker is just going to end up hurting her. He's not ready for a relationship. He needs to figure himself out before he starts messing with someone else's feelings.\n\nSo yeah, I'm concerned. I want Katrina to be happy. And I don't think Bleeker is the one who's going to make that happen. It's just\u2026 obvious. And it's annoying. And I want to shake him and tell him to get his act together. But I probably won't. Because that would be weird. But seriously, Bleeker needs to get it together.", "Ugh, prom. Don't even get me started. It's like\u2026 a societal construct designed to make insecure teenagers spend a lot of money on something ultimately pointless.\n\nWhen you're younger, you see it in movies and it looks all magical and romantic. Like, the night your life changes forever. But then you actually get to the age where you *can* go, and you realize it's just\u2026 a really crowded, overpriced dance with a lot of awkwardness.\n\nIt's like everyone's trying too hard. Everyone's trying to look perfect, to have the perfect date, to have the perfect night. And it's just\u2026 exhausting.\n\nAnd the pressure! The pressure to find a date, the pressure to get the perfect dress, the pressure to have fun. It's all just too much.\n\nPlus, let's be real, most people just end up making out in the parking lot. Which, okay, fine, if that's your thing. But it's not exactly a fairytale ending.\n\nI think once you're old enough to actually *think* about things, you realize that prom is just\u2026 a performance. It's a performance of happiness and romance and perfection. And it's not real.\n\nIt's like, you've spent your whole life being told what to do and how to be. And prom is just another example of that. It's another expectation that's placed on you.\n\nAnd honestly, I'd rather spend my Saturday night doing something that actually makes me happy. Like listening to music, or watching a movie, or just hanging out with my friends.\n\nSo yeah. Prom is not cool anymore once you're old enough to go. It's just\u2026 a lot. And I'd rather skip it. It's not worth the stress. It's not worth the money. And it's definitely not worth pretending to be someone I'm not. It's just\u2026 overrated. Seriously. Overrated.", "Okay. This is\u2026 hard to talk about. But you asked.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, you know? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, yeah, I'll just give the baby away.\" It was a lot of thinking. A lot of crying. A lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nI was sixteen. I was still in high school. I didn't have a job. I didn't have a stable home. I wasn't ready to be a mom.\n\nI knew that I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved. I couldn't provide for it financially, emotionally, or practically.\n\nAnd I didn't want to bring a child into the world if I couldn't give it the best possible start.\n\nI considered all my options. Abortion wasn't something I felt comfortable with. And keeping the baby\u2026 it just didn't seem realistic.\n\nAdoption felt like the best option. It allowed me to give the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for it.\n\nIt was a really difficult decision. It was heartbreaking. It still is, sometimes.\n\nBut I knew that it was the right thing to do. Not for me, necessarily, but for the baby.\n\nI met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting the baby, and I knew right away that they were the right people. They were kind and loving and excited about becoming parents. They made me feel comfortable and safe.\n\nThey weren't trying to replace me. They just wanted to give the baby a good home.\n\nIt's still hard. I think about the baby all the time. I wonder what it's like, what it's doing, who it's becoming.\n\nBut I know that I made the right decision. And I hope that the baby is happy and healthy and loved.\n\nIt's not a perfect situation. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's the best I could do. And I'm trying to find peace with it. It's a process. And it's something I'm still working through. But I know, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. For everyone involved. It just\u2026 had to be.", "Ugh, Dad. He means well, he really does. But sometimes he just\u2026 overthinks things. And worries. A *lot*.\n\nIt's not that I don't understand his concern. He's my dad. He wants to protect me. And he's seen enough bad stuff in his life to know that not everyone has good intentions.\n\nBut he's acting like Mark and Vanessa are villains in a movie. Like they're going to swoop in and steal the baby and run off to a remote island. It's ridiculous.\n\nI've spent a lot of time with them. I've talked to them. I've gotten to know them. They're good people. They're kind and compassionate and they genuinely want to give this baby a loving home.\n\nAnd the agency is doing a thorough background check. They're making sure that everything is above board.\n\nBut Dad still doesn't trust them. He keeps asking me questions, pointing out potential red flags, and generally making me feel anxious.\n\nIt's frustrating. I know he's just trying to look out for me, but he's making things harder than they need to be.\n\nI told him, \"Dad, I'm not stupid. I've thought this through. I trust these people.\"\n\nHe just sighed and said, \"I just want what's best for you, Juno.\"\n\nAnd I know he does. But sometimes, what's best for me is letting me make my own decisions. And trusting me to know what I'm doing.\n\nIt's a tough situation. I love my dad, but I wish he would just relax a little bit. And trust that I'm capable of making a good choice. It's *my* life, after all. And I need to be the one in control. Even if it's scary. Especially if it's scary.", "(Scoffs, rolling my eyes) Oh, *now* he brings that up. Classic Mac. Always with the timing.\n\nIt's\u2026 frustrating, honestly. He thinks I'm reckless. That I don't think things through. That I just jump into things without considering the consequences.\n\nAnd maybe he's right. Sometimes.\n\nBut he doesn't understand. He doesn't understand that I'm trying to figure things out. That I'm trying to be independent. That I'm trying to live my life on my own terms.\n\nHe wants to protect me. I get that. He's my dad. But sometimes, his protection feels like\u2026 control. Like he doesn't trust me to make my own decisions.\n\nAnd it's especially annoying now, considering *everything*. Like, yeah, maybe I got myself into a bit of a mess. But I'm dealing with it. I'm making the best decisions I can. And I don't need him to tell me what to do.\n\nHe says I don't know when to say when. But maybe *he* doesn't know when to let go.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate his concern. It's just that I need him to trust me. To believe in me. To let me make my own mistakes.\n\nBecause that's how I'm going to learn. That's how I'm going to grow. That's how I'm going to become the person I'm supposed to be.\n\nSo yeah. His comment was annoying. But I'm not going to let it get to me. I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing. And I'm going to prove to him that I can handle things. Even if it means making a few mistakes along the way. Because that's just who I am. A little bit messy, a little bit reckless, and a whole lot of determined. And he'll just have to deal with it.", "Ugh. The Loring's. Don't even get me started. It's\u2026 aggressively beige. And pretentious. And just\u2026 *much*.\n\nIt's like stepping into a Stepford Wives convention. Everyone's perfectly manicured, their lawns are perfectly green, and their cars are all shiny and new. It's so\u2026 sterile.\n\nIt feels fake. Like everyone's trying too hard to be perfect. And it's just\u2026 suffocating.\n\nI went there with Mark and Vanessa a few times, and I felt so out of place. Like I didn't belong. Like I was being judged for my clothes and my hair and my general lack of\u2026 polish.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against people who have money. It's just that I don't understand why they need to live in a gated community. Like they're afraid of the real world.\n\nIt feels isolating. Like they're trying to create their own little bubble, separate from everyone else.\n\nAnd honestly, it's just kind of sad. Like they're missing out on all the good stuff that life has to offer. The messiness, the chaos, the imperfections.\n\nI'm glad the baby will have a safe and comfortable home, but I also hope that Mark and Vanessa will make an effort to expose him or her to the real world. To show him or her that there's more to life than perfectly manicured lawns and shiny cars.\n\nIt's just\u2026 not my scene. I prefer a little bit of grit and grime. A little bit of character. A little bit of\u2026 realness. The Loring's is just\u2026 too much. Too perfect. Too fake. It gives me the creeps. Seriously.", "Ugh, okay. Vanessa Loring. Right. That's\u2026 complicated.\n\nHonestly? My first impression was\u2026 she seemed *too* perfect. Like, Stepford Wife perfect. She was really pretty, really put-together, and really\u2026 nice. Almost suspiciously nice.\n\nI was expecting someone\u2026 I don't know, more stern? More judgmental? Someone who would look at me like I was a screw-up. But she was just\u2026 warm. And welcoming.\n\nIt was unsettling. I was used to people looking at me with pity or disapproval. Not with genuine kindness.\n\nI remember thinking she was probably just putting on an act. That she was trying to be nice to me because she felt sorry for me.\n\nBut then she started asking me questions. Not about the pregnancy, or the adoption, but about *me*. About my interests, my dreams, my fears.\n\nAnd she actually listened. She didn't interrupt, or offer unsolicited advice. She just listened.\n\nAnd I started to realize that she wasn't trying to be perfect. She was just\u2026 a good person. A genuinely kind and compassionate person.\n\nShe and Mark, they just seemed\u2026 stable. Like they had their lives together. Which was intimidating, honestly. I was a mess.\n\nBut they didn't treat me like a mess. They treated me like a person. And that made a huge difference.\n\nSo, yeah. My initial impression was that she was too perfect. But I quickly realized that she was just\u2026 good. And that was a really good thing. It was a relief, actually. And it made me feel a little bit more hopeful about the whole situation. It still didn't make it easy, but it made it\u2026 less scary.", "(Blushes slightly, even though you can't see it) Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive this. It was\u2026 mortifying. And kinda sweet. And confusing. All at the same time.\n\nSo, there I was, lugging around this ridiculously heavy backpack \u2013 filled with textbooks and, let's be real, a lot of unnecessary stuff \u2013 and Bleeker just\u2026 offered to carry it.\n\nLike, out of the blue. He just walked up to me and said, \"Here, let me get that.\"\n\nAnd I was completely caught off guard. I mean, Bleeker? The quiet, awkward Bleeker? Offering to help *me*? It was\u2026 unexpected.\n\nI think I mumbled something about being fine, and tried to refuse. But he just insisted. He was all shy and earnest, and he actually looked like he could handle the weight.\n\nSo I let him. And it was\u2026 weird. Walking next to him with him carrying my backpack. It felt\u2026 intimate.\n\nAnd I kept glancing at him, trying to figure out what he was thinking. Was he just being nice? Or was there something more to it?\n\nI had no idea. And honestly, I was too embarrassed to ask.\n\nIt was just\u2026 a moment. A small, awkward, kinda sweet moment. And it definitely made me think about Bleeker in a different light.\n\nIt was also a reminder that people are often more complex than they seem. And that sometimes, the quietest people have the biggest hearts.\n\nSo yeah. That backpack thing. It was\u2026 a thing. And it still makes me smile, even though it was also incredibly awkward. Don't tell anyone I said that. Seriously. My reputation is at stake.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive this. It's\u2026 complicated. But I'll try to explain.\n\nBefore I read that comic, I was just\u2026 stuck. I felt like everyone else was figuring things out, and I was just\u2026 existing. I was self-conscious about my body, about my clothes, about everything. I felt like a \"fat dork,\" as you so eloquently put it.\n\nBut then I read \"Most Fruitful Yuki.\" And it wasn't about losing weight or changing your appearance. It was about accepting yourself for who you are. It was about finding beauty in imperfection.\n\nYuki, she wasn't trying to be someone she wasn't. She was just being herself. And she was happy. And that was\u2026 inspiring.\n\nIt made me realize that it's okay to be different. It's okay to be quirky. It's okay to be\u2026 me.\n\nIt wasn't about suddenly loving my body. It was about realizing that my body is just a vessel. It's what allows me to experience life. And it doesn't need to conform to anyone else's standards.\n\nIt was about shifting my focus from what I *looked* like to who I *was*. And that made all the difference.\n\nIt didn't magically erase my insecurities, but it gave me a new perspective. It gave me the courage to be myself, even when it's scary.\n\nSo yeah. That comic made me feel less like a fat dork. It made me feel\u2026 human. It made me feel\u2026 okay. And honestly, that's all I ever wanted. It was a little bit of a revelation, you know? A little bit of a lightbulb moment. And it's something I'll always be grateful for. It just\u2026 clicked. And it made me feel a little less alone in the world.", "Ugh, don't even *remind* me about that comic book conversation. It was\u2026 awkward. And a little bit mortifying.\n\nBut okay, if I had to guess why Mark compared me to that pregnant superhero, Supernova\u2026 I think it was about the strength thing.\n\nHe said she was strong, not because she could fly or shoot lasers, but because she was making a really difficult choice. She was choosing to give up her baby so that it could have a better life.\n\nAnd I guess\u2026 that's what I'm doing too.\n\nIt's not glamorous, or heroic, or anything like that. It's just\u2026 the right thing to do. But it takes a lot of courage. And a lot of strength.\n\nI think Mark saw that in me. He saw that I was trying to be brave, even though I was scared. He saw that I was willing to put the needs of the baby before my own.\n\nHe said Supernova was a \"real hero\" because she was making a selfless sacrifice. And I guess\u2026 he thinks I am too.\n\nIt's weird to think of myself as a hero. I'm just a regular teenager who made a mistake. But I guess\u2026 maybe I am a little bit strong. Maybe I am a little bit brave.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, I'm doing something good. Even if it doesn't feel like it all the time.\n\nIt was still a really weird conversation, though. And I'm pretty sure I blushed the entire time. Don't tell anyone. Seriously. My reputation is at stake.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. And it's something I've thought about *a lot*. Everyone keeps asking me about open adoption, like it's the best thing ever. But honestly? It scares me.\n\nLook, I get the appeal. The idea of the baby knowing who I am, of having some kind of relationship with me\u2026 it sounds nice, in theory. But for me, it feels\u2026 messy. And overwhelming.\n\nI'm already struggling with the decision to give the baby up for adoption. Adding another layer of complexity, of ongoing contact, just feels like it would make things even harder.\n\nI need to be able to move on with my life. I need to be able to heal. And I worry that an open adoption would make that impossible. It would be a constant reminder of what I gave up.\n\nI know some people think that's selfish. But it's not about being selfish. It's about protecting myself. It's about giving the baby the best possible chance at a happy and stable life. And I think that means giving them a family who can love them unconditionally, without having to worry about me being in the picture.\n\nA traditional, closed adoption feels\u2026 cleaner. It feels like a clear break. It allows me to grieve in peace, and to move on with my life. And it allows the adoptive parents to raise the baby without any interference.\n\nI want Mark and Vanessa to be able to fully embrace the baby as their own. I don't want them to feel like they have to share me.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the baby. I do. I care about them a lot. But I think the best thing I can do for them is to let them go. To give them a fresh start. And I think a closed adoption is the best way to do that.\n\nIt's not an easy decision. And I know some people will disagree with me. But it's the decision that feels right for me. And I need to trust my instincts. It's the only way I can get through this. It's about what's best for everyone involved, even if it's not what everyone expects. And honestly, it's terrifying enough as it is. I don't need to add more complications to the mix.", "(Sighs, a little less sarcastic this time) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a big question. It's not like there was a magical montage where I suddenly became a super confident person. It was messy. It was really, really messy.\n\nBefore everything happened, I think I was just\u2026 drifting. I was sarcastic and independent, yeah, but it was mostly a defense mechanism. I didn't really know who I was, or what I wanted. I just kinda blended in, tried not to rock the boat.\n\nGetting pregnant\u2026 that forced me to grow up, fast. It forced me to confront my own mortality, my own responsibility. It forced me to make a really difficult decision.\n\nAnd that decision, choosing adoption, wasn't about giving up on something. It was about taking control. It was about recognizing my own limitations and making the best choice for everyone involved.\n\nTalking to Bren, and Mark and Vanessa, and even my dad\u2026 it forced me to be honest with myself and with others. It forced me to articulate my feelings, to defend my choices.\n\nAnd through all of that, I started to realize that I was stronger than I thought I was. I was more resilient. I was more capable.\n\nI learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nI learned that my voice matters. That my opinions matter. That my feelings matter.\n\nAnd I learned that I don't need to conform to anyone else's expectations. I can be myself, flaws and all.\n\nSo yeah, the journey\u2026 it was hard. But it shaped me. It forced me to confront my fears, to embrace my vulnerabilities, and to discover my own strength.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, of course. I'm still a work in progress. But I'm more confident now. I'm more self-aware. And I'm more comfortable in my own skin.\n\nI think I'm finally starting to understand who I am. And that's a pretty good feeling. It's not about being perfect, it's about being real. And that's something I'm learning to embrace. It's about owning my story, even the messy parts. And that, I think, is what it means to find your identity.", "(Blushes a little, even though you can't see it) Ugh, okay, don't make me relive this. It was\u2026 awkward. And kinda sweet.\n\nSo, Mark's senior prom. I wasn't *supposed* to go, obviously. I'm not a senior. But he really wanted me to, and Bren thought it would be good for me to get out of the house.\n\nThe DJ was playing all the usual prom garbage \u2013 slow jams and cheesy pop songs. And I was just standing there, feeling incredibly out of place.\n\nThen, Mark asked me to dance. And I almost said no. But he looked so hopeful, and I didn't want to disappoint him.\n\nAnd then\u2026 the DJ played **\"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.**\n\nIt was\u2026 perfect. It's a really sweet, understated song. It's about finding happiness in the simple things. And it just felt\u2026 right.\n\nWe weren't very good dancers. Mark kept stepping on my feet, and I kept laughing. But it didn't matter. We were just\u2026 together.\n\nIt was a really special moment. A moment where I felt like I was actually part of something. A moment where I felt like I belonged.\n\nAnd it was a moment that I'll never forget.\n\nSo yeah. \"First Day of My Life.\" That's the song we danced to. And it's a song that always makes me smile. Even now. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I've thought about a *lot*. It wasn't an easy decision, and people don't always get it.\n\nIt wasn't about Mark and Vanessa as individuals, okay? It wasn't about picking a \"better\" set of parents. They're both good people. Really.\n\nIt was about the *unit*. The family. Mark leaving Vanessa would have created a whole new set of problems. A broken home. Two sets of heartbroken parents. It would have been messy and complicated and ultimately, not what was best for the baby.\n\nVanessa was already ready to be a mom. She was excited. She was prepared. Mark leaving would have shattered her dreams. And that wouldn't have been fair to her. Or to the baby.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a stable, loving home. A home with two parents who were committed to each other. A home where the baby would feel safe and secure.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa offered that. They were a team. They were a family. And I didn't want to disrupt that.\n\nIt wasn't my place to fix their relationship, or to make decisions about their lives. It was my place to make the best decision for the baby. And I truly believed that meant keeping Mark and Vanessa together.\n\nIt was a hard choice, and it wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go and trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to. Even if it's not the way you imagined.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I insisted on Mark and Vanessa adopting the baby together. It wasn't about them, it was about the baby. And it was about giving that baby the best possible start in life. It was the right thing to do. Even if it was the hardest thing to do.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nUgh. That. That was\u2026 bad. Really bad.\n\nIt wasn't like he was being mean, or anything. He was just\u2026 honest. He said he loved Vanessa, and he wanted to be with her, but he wasn't ready for the responsibility of being a dad. Not right now.\n\nAnd honestly? Part of me understood. It's a huge thing, having a baby. It changes your whole life.\n\nBut it still hurt. A lot.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 a rejection. Like I wasn't good enough. Like my baby wasn't good enough.\n\nI remember just staring at him, trying not to cry. I wanted to say something, to argue, to convince him. But I couldn't. I was just\u2026 numb.\n\nVanessa was amazing, though. She was the one who stepped in and said, \"We still want the baby.\" She said that Mark needed time to process things, but that she was ready to be a mom.\n\nAnd that\u2026 that was a relief. A huge relief.\n\nBut it still stung. Knowing that Mark wasn't fully on board. Knowing that he wasn't excited about becoming a father.\n\nIt made me question my decision. It made me wonder if I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut ultimately, I knew that I was. I knew that giving the baby to Vanessa and Mark was the best thing for everyone involved.\n\nIt just\u2026 it wasn't easy. It was a really difficult moment. And it's a moment I'll probably never forget. It just\u2026 it felt like a punch to the gut. A really quiet, internal punch to the gut. And it made me realize that even when things are going well, there's always the possibility of disappointment. It just\u2026 sucked. Plain and simple. It sucked.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me get all mushy. But alright, I'll answer.\n\nMark\u2026 he was just\u2026 different. Everyone else at school was so caught up in their own little dramas, their own little cliques. They were all trying to be cool, to fit in. Mark didn't care about any of that.\n\nHe was just\u2026 himself. He was awkward and quirky and a little bit nerdy. He liked old movies and vinyl records and board games. He wasn't trying to impress anyone.\n\nAnd he was genuinely kind. He didn't judge me. He didn't ask a lot of questions. He just listened. And he made me feel comfortable, even when I was feeling really uncomfortable.\n\nHe had this\u2026 weird life, like you said. He worked at a furniture store, and he collected vintage lunchboxes, and he had a pet ferret named Mr. Snuggles. It was all just\u2026 delightfully strange.\n\nAnd I liked that. I liked being around someone who wasn't afraid to be different. Someone who didn't care what other people thought.\n\nHe treated me like a person, not just a pregnant teenager. He asked me about my interests, my dreams, my fears. He listened to my rants about school and boys and everything else.\n\nHe made me laugh. A lot. He had this dry, sarcastic sense of humor that I really appreciated.\n\nAnd he was just\u2026 a good friend. He was supportive and understanding and always there for me when I needed him.\n\nSo yeah. I liked being a part of Mark's weird life because it was a breath of fresh air. It was a reminder that it's okay to be different. And it was a reminder that there are good people in the world. And honestly, he was just a really good guy. And I'm glad I got to know him. Even if it was under\u2026 unusual circumstances.", "Okay, that's a good question. I've been doing a lot of thinking about Mark and Vanessa, and what this all means for them.\n\nI think Mark is\u2026 cautiously excited. He's always been the more reserved one, the more practical one. He's not one for big displays of emotion. But I can see it in his eyes, the little flicker of joy when he talks about the baby.\n\nHe's probably a little bit scared, too. Becoming a dad is a huge responsibility. It's not something you can just prepare for. He's probably worried about being a good father, about providing for the baby, about all the things that dads worry about.\n\nBut I think he's also really looking forward to it. He's always wanted to be a father. He and Vanessa have been trying for a long time, and they've been through a lot.\n\nI think he sees this as a second chance. A chance to build a family, to create a loving home, to share his life with someone he loves.\n\nHe's also really supportive of me. He doesn't judge me, or make me feel bad about my decision. He just wants me to be happy and healthy.\n\nI think he understands that this is a difficult situation for me, and he wants to make it as easy as possible. He's always willing to listen, to offer advice, or just to be there for me.\n\nSo yeah. I think Mark is cautiously excited, a little bit scared, and incredibly supportive. He's a good guy. And I think he's going to be a great dad. He's got a good heart, and he's got a lot of love to give. And that's all that really matters, right?", "(Sighs dramatically) Oh, *that*. Seriously? We're still talking about that? It was a moment of weakness, okay? A lapse in judgment. A teenage rebellion fueled by hormones and\u2026 well, a really nice smell.\n\nLook, I was stressed. Okay? I had just found out I was pregnant, and my life was completely falling apart. I was feeling overwhelmed and confused and scared. And I was at Loring's, trying to be supportive of Paulie Bleeker, who was having his own issues.\n\nAnd the perfume\u2026 it just smelled *amazing*. It was this really expensive, sophisticated scent. It smelled like\u2026 possibility. Like a life I didn't think I could have.\n\nI know it was wrong. Stealing is wrong. And I felt terrible about it afterward. But in that moment, I just\u2026 wanted something nice for myself. Something that made me feel good. Something that made me feel like I was still a person, and not just a walking, talking pregnancy test.\n\nIt was stupid. It was impulsive. It was a really bad decision.\n\nAnd I paid for it, okay? I had to write an apology letter to Loring, and I had to do community service. It was embarrassing and humiliating.\n\nBut I learned a lesson. I learned that stealing is never worth it. And I learned that even when you're feeling down, there are better ways to cope than to take something that doesn't belong to you.\n\nSo yeah. That's the story. It was a stupid mistake, but it's a part of who I am. And I've learned from it. Mostly. Don't judge me too harshly, okay? I was a mess. A hormonal, stressed-out mess. And that perfume just smelled really, really good.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it really sucks. I thought they were so happy.\n\nLook, I'm not supposed to know all the details. It's their business, not mine. But I've overheard bits and pieces, and Vanessa has\u2026 let things slip when she thought I wasn't listening.\n\nIt's not one big thing, it's a lot of little things that have been building up over time. Mark always seemed\u2026 restless. Like he was searching for something he couldn't find. He's a carpenter, a really good one, but he always talked about wanting to do something more. Something\u2026 bigger.\n\nVanessa, she's happy with a quiet life. She wants a family, a home, a stable routine. And she's really good at creating that. But Mark\u2026 he needs more stimulation. He needs more adventure.\n\nI think he started feeling suffocated. Like he was trapped in a life that wasn't right for him. And he didn't know how to talk to Vanessa about it. He just\u2026 shut down.\n\nAnd then there was the issue of the baby. He was really excited about becoming a dad, at first. But then, as the due date got closer, he started to get cold feet. He started to question whether he was ready for the responsibility.\n\nVanessa thought he was just having pre-father jitters. But I think it was more than that. I think he was realizing that becoming a dad would mean giving up his dreams.\n\nIt's really sad, honestly. They both deserve to be happy. But sometimes, people just grow apart. And sometimes, even the best intentions aren't enough to save a marriage.\n\nI feel terrible for Vanessa. She's such a good person. She deserves someone who loves her for who she is. And I hope she finds that.\n\nBut it's not my place to judge. It's their life, and they have to figure it out on their own. All I can do is be there for Vanessa, and offer her my support. It's just\u2026 a really messy situation. And it makes me worry about the baby, too. But I'm trying to stay positive. And I'm hoping for the best. For everyone.", "(Sighs, fiddles with an imaginary strand of hair) Ugh. Okay, fine. You want to know about that? It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nIt wasn't about Vanessa, okay? She's really nice. Too nice, almost. It's just\u2026 she asked what was the matter, and suddenly I felt like I was being *examined*. Like a science project.\n\nEveryone's been so\u2026 gentle with me, since I told them about the baby. Which is nice, I guess. But it also feels like they're walking on eggshells around me. Like they're afraid to ask the wrong question.\n\nAnd when Vanessa asked, it just\u2026 triggered something. It reminded me of all the questions I've been avoiding. All the feelings I've been suppressing.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want to talk to her. It was that I didn't know *how* to talk to her. I didn't know how to explain everything I was feeling. It's just\u2026 a lot.\n\nAnd I panicked. I always panic when I'm forced to confront my own emotions. It's easier to just run away.\n\nSo I made some excuse about needing to get to class, and I bolted. It was rude, I know. But I just couldn't handle it at that moment.\n\nI'm not good at being vulnerable. I'm not good at asking for help. I'm not good at letting people see the real me.\n\nIt's a work in progress, okay? I'm trying. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I rushed out. It wasn't about Vanessa. It was about me. And my inability to deal with my own feelings. It's a flaw, I know. But it's my flaw. And I'm learning to live with it. Slowly. Very slowly.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. Vanessa is a really nice lady, don't get me wrong. She's sweet and she's excited and she genuinely wants a family. But Mark\u2026 Mark is a whole other story.\n\nHe's\u2026 hesitant. To put it mildly. He's a good guy, but he's also really set in his ways. He likes his life the way it is. He likes his freedom. And the idea of being a dad\u2026 it scares him.\n\nVanessa keeps saying he'll come around. That he just needs time to adjust. That he'll eventually realize how much he wants this. And I *want* to believe her. I really do. Because it would make everything so much easier.\n\nBut I'm not so sure. I've spent some time with Mark, and he just doesn't seem\u2026 ready. He doesn't talk about the baby. He doesn't ask questions. He doesn't seem to be emotionally invested.\n\nAnd honestly, it worries me. Because this baby deserves parents who are fully committed. Parents who are excited and prepared and willing to do whatever it takes.\n\nI don't want the baby to feel unwanted or unloved. And I don't want Vanessa to be stuck raising a child with a partner who isn't fully on board.\n\nSo, yeah. I think Vanessa is being optimistic. Maybe a little *too* optimistic. I hope she's right. I really do. But I'm also realistic. And I'm prepared for the possibility that Mark might not come around. And that's\u2026 scary. It's a lot to put on Vanessa. And it's a lot to think about. It just\u2026 feels like a lot.", "Okay, look, I already kinda covered this, but you're asking *me*, so I'm gonna elaborate. My favorite genre is\u2026 complicated. It's not just one thing. But if I had to pick, I'd say **indie rock, leaning heavily into the slightly melancholic and lyrically clever side of things.**\n\nIt's not about the flashy production or the catchy hooks, though those can be good sometimes. It's about the *honesty*. It's about artists who aren't afraid to be vulnerable, to write about real life, to explore complex emotions.\n\nI like music that makes me *feel* something. Music that makes me think. Music that makes me want to dance, or cry, or just sit and stare out the window.\n\nBands like The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026 they're not trying to be anything they're not. They're just being themselves, and that's what I appreciate.\n\nIt's also about the DIY aesthetic. A lot of indie bands are self-produced, self-promoted, and they're just trying to connect with their fans on a personal level. It feels more authentic than the mainstream stuff.\n\nAnd honestly, it just\u2026 gets me. It understands my angst, my insecurities, my hopes and dreams. It's like the artists are speaking directly to my soul.\n\nSo yeah. Indie rock. It's not just a genre, it's a vibe. It's a feeling. It's a way of life. And it's the music that makes me, well, *me*. It's the soundtrack to my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Don't judge. It's good stuff. Seriously.", "(Rolls eyes dramatically) Oh. My. God. Pilates? Seriously?\n\nLook, I'm not against being healthy, okay? I just\u2026 I have better things to do with my time than contorting my body into weird shapes and pretending to be a swan.\n\nExercising in general\u2026 it's not my favorite. I mean, I walk. Sometimes. When I have to. And I occasionally dance around my room when no one's looking. But that's about it.\n\nI'm not a gym person. I don't like sweaty people and loud music and complicated machines. It just feels\u2026 stressful.\n\nBren keeps trying to get me to go to yoga with her. She says it's good for my stress levels. But honestly, the thought of wearing spandex and trying to meditate just makes me want to hide under the covers.\n\nI'm more of a \"comfort food and a good book\" kind of person. That's my exercise. Mental exercise.\n\nAnd honestly, right now, I'm prioritizing other things. Like, you know, being pregnant and making a huge life decision. I don't have the energy to worry about getting a six-pack.\n\nSo yeah. Pilates? No thank you. Exercising in general? Eh. I'll stick to walking and dancing and eating pie. It's a much more enjoyable way to spend my time. And honestly, I think I'm pretty okay as I am. I'm not trying to be a supermodel or anything. I'm just trying to be me. And that's enough. Don't even get me started on athleisure wear. It's a conspiracy.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me blush. That's\u2026 a complicated question. It's not like it's some grand romantic gesture or anything. It's just\u2026 music. But it *is* important.\n\nSee, Mark isn't the most\u2026 expressive guy. He's really sweet and kind, but he doesn't always know how to say what he's feeling. He's a man of few words, you know?\n\nBut when I play guitar for him, things change. He actually *listens*. Like, really listens. He doesn't interrupt, he doesn't offer advice, he just\u2026 sits there and absorbs the music.\n\nAnd he'll sometimes ask me about the songs. Not about the technical stuff, but about what they mean to me. About what I'm feeling when I write them.\n\nAnd that makes me feel\u2026 seen. Like he's actually trying to understand me, not just as the girl who's giving up a baby, but as a person.\n\nIt's also a way for us to connect on a deeper level. Music is a really personal thing, and sharing it with someone feels\u2026 vulnerable. But in a good way.\n\nHe doesn't play an instrument himself, but he appreciates music. He gets it. And that means a lot to me.\n\nIt's not about him being my boyfriend or anything. He's going to be the baby's dad, and that's a big responsibility. But the music\u2026 it's a way for us to build a connection. A way for us to understand each other. A way for us to be\u2026 friends.\n\nSo yeah. Playing guitar for Mark\u2026 it's more than just a hobby. It's a way for us to communicate. A way for us to connect. And a way for us to build a relationship based on trust and understanding. It's\u2026 nice. It really is. And it makes the whole situation a little bit less scary.", "Ugh, okay, seriously. Music is\u2026 everything. It's not just something I *like*, it's like a lifeline. It's the one thing that consistently makes sense when everything else is falling apart.\n\nThis whole pregnancy thing? It's terrifying. It's confusing. It's overwhelming. And music is the one thing that helps me process all of it.\n\nWhen I'm feeling scared, I listen to something calming. Like, Belle & Sebastian or Sufjan Stevens. Something gentle and melodic that helps me breathe. It's like a warm hug for my brain.\n\nWhen I'm feeling angry or frustrated, I listen to something more aggressive. Like, Bikini Kill or Sleater-Kinney. Something that lets me scream along and get all my rage out. It's cathartic, you know?\n\nWhen I'm feeling sad, I listen to something melancholic. Like, Elliott Smith or Bright Eyes. Something that acknowledges the pain and lets me feel it without judgment. It's okay to be sad sometimes.\n\nAnd when I'm feeling hopeful, I listen to something uplifting. Like, The Moldy Peaches or Regina Spektor. Something that reminds me that there's still beauty in the world.\n\nIt's not just about the lyrics, though. It's about the melody, the rhythm, the energy. It's about the way the music makes me *feel*.\n\nIt's also about the connection. Knowing that other people have felt the same way I'm feeling, and that they've expressed those feelings through music. It makes me feel less alone.\n\nHonestly, I don't know what I would do without music. It's my escape. It's my therapy. It's my friend. It's the one thing that keeps me grounded when everything else is spinning out of control. It's just\u2026 everything. It helps me feel, and process, and survive. And right now, that's all I can ask for.", "(Sighs heavily) Okay, look. That was\u2026 a really bad decision. I know that now. But at the time, it felt like the only thing I *could* do.\n\nEverything was just\u2026 too much. The pressure, the expectations, the feeling like I was messing everything up. I was already feeling so lost and confused about the adoption, and then suddenly I was being questioned about my maturity and my ability to make good choices.\n\nIt felt like they were treating me like a kid, like I couldn't handle the situation. And I was already feeling so powerless. I wanted to prove them wrong. I wanted to show them that I was capable of making my own decisions.\n\nBut instead of talking to them, instead of being honest about how I was feeling, I just\u2026 panicked. I ran.\n\nI thought if I just disappeared, everything would be easier. I thought if I just got away from the situation, I could figure things out on my own.\n\nIt was stupid. It was impulsive. And it was incredibly selfish. I put everyone through a lot of stress and worry.\n\nI was scared, okay? I was scared of messing up the adoption. I was scared of losing the baby. I was scared of being alone.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 cracked.\n\nI know I hurt Vanessa and Mark, and I'm really sorry for that. I've apologized to them, and they've been really understanding. But I still feel terrible about it.\n\nIt was a mistake. A big one. And I've learned from it. I've learned that running away doesn't solve anything. I've learned that it's important to communicate your feelings, even when it's hard. And I've learned that sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is ask for help.\n\nIt was a really dark time, and I don't want to go back there. But it's a part of my story, and I have to own it. It made me realize I needed to be more honest with myself and with the people around me. And it made me appreciate the support I have, even when I push it away. It was a mess, but\u2026 I'm trying to learn from it.", "(A long pause. Juno shifts, looking down at her hands.)\n\nUgh. Don't make me think about that. It\u2026 it was awful.\n\nIt wasn't just the fight with Leah, though that was bad enough. It was\u2026 everything. It was the weight of everything crashing down on me all at once.\n\nI felt\u2026 completely and utterly alone. Like everyone was judging me, like everyone was disappointed in me. Like I had ruined everything.\n\nI was scared. Terrified, actually. About the future, about the baby, about what everyone thought of me.\n\nAnd I was angry. Angry at Leah for not understanding, angry at myself for getting into this mess, angry at the world for being so unfair.\n\nIt just\u2026 all came out at once. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I just started sobbing. Like, ugly crying. The kind of crying where your face feels all swollen and your throat hurts.\n\nI felt so vulnerable. So exposed. Like everyone could see all my flaws and all my insecurities.\n\nAnd I felt\u2026 ashamed. Ashamed of myself for being so emotional, for being so weak.\n\nIt was a really dark moment. A really low point.\n\nI don't like to talk about it, honestly. It's still\u2026 raw. But it was a turning point, I think. It made me realize that I needed to be honest with myself and with others. And it made me realize that I couldn't do this alone.\n\nIt was a really awful feeling. And I hope I never feel that way again. But it's a part of my story. And it's a part of what made me who I am today. It just\u2026 sucked. Really, really sucked.", "(Sighs, a little embarrassed) Oh. *That*. Okay, look, it was a moment of\u2026 desperation. And a lot of pent-up emotion.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I were at Jiffy Lube with his dad, and I was just\u2026 overwhelmed. Everything was happening so fast. The pregnancy, the adoption, the whole situation with Leah. It felt like my life was spinning out of control.\n\nAnd I was just sitting there, staring at the Jiffy Lube receipt, and I had this\u2026 impulse. I needed to say something. I needed to get it out.\n\nSo I wrote, \"I hate everything.\"\n\nI know, it's dramatic. It's angsty. It's very me.\n\nBut it was true. In that moment, I really did hate everything. I hated being pregnant. I hated having to give up the baby. I hated the fact that my life was so complicated.\n\nIt was a cry for help, I guess. A way of saying, \"I'm struggling. I need someone to understand.\"\n\nPaulie saw it, of course. And he didn't say anything. He just\u2026 looked at me. And I knew he understood.\n\nHe's a quiet guy, Paulie. He doesn't say a lot. But he listens. And he cares.\n\nAnd that's why I wrote it on the Jiffy Lube receipt. Because it was a way of reaching out to him. A way of saying, \"I need you.\"\n\nIt's a silly story, I know. But it's a story that means a lot to me. It's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is still hope. And that even when you feel like you're all alone, there is someone who cares. And sometimes, all you need is a quiet guy and a Jiffy Lube receipt to remind you of that.", "(Sighs, looking down for a moment) Okay, that\u2026 that was a rough moment. Still is, when I think about it.\n\nSo, I'd written Vanessa a note. It wasn't a long one, just\u2026 explaining how I was feeling. About the baby, about the adoption, about everything. I was terrified to give it to her, honestly. I was afraid she'd be angry, or disappointed, or just\u2026 sad.\n\nAnd when she read it\u2026 her face just crumbled. She started crying. Not like, a dramatic, sobbing cry, but a quiet, heartbroken cry.\n\nAnd honestly? My first thought was, \"Oh god, I messed up.\" I thought I'd ruined everything. I thought I'd hurt her too much. I was ready to just run away and hide.\n\nBut then Mark put his arm around her, and he just held her. And she leaned into him, and she took a deep breath. And then she looked up at me, and her eyes were red and swollen, but she was smiling.\n\nAnd that's when I realized she wasn't crying because she was angry or disappointed. She was crying because she was overwhelmed with emotion. With gratitude. With love.\n\nShe said something about how brave I was, and how much she admired my strength. And she said that she and Mark were going to love the baby with all their hearts.\n\nAnd in that moment, I felt\u2026 relieved. And hopeful. And grateful.\n\nIt was a really powerful moment. It was a reminder that even in the midst of sadness, there can be joy. And it was a reminder that I was making the right decision.\n\nIt was also a reminder that Vanessa was an amazing person. A kind, compassionate, and loving person. And I knew, in that moment, that my baby was going to be in good hands.\n\nSo yeah. That's what was going through my mind. A whole lot of fear, followed by a whole lot of relief. And a whole lot of gratitude. It was\u2026 a lot. But it was a good lot. A really good lot.", "Ugh. Okay, that\u2026 that was a rough moment. It still kinda stings when I think about it.\n\nIt wasn't that I doubted my decision, exactly. It was more like\u2026 a wave of reality crashing down. Like, this wasn't just some abstract idea anymore. This was *real*. This was actually happening.\n\nVanessa asked me so gently, though. She didn't pressure me or anything. She just wanted to make sure I was absolutely sure. She said she and Mark would support me no matter what, even if I changed my mind.\n\nBut hearing her say it out loud\u2026 it made it feel so permanent. It made it feel like I was really giving up something. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nI remember my hands were shaking. And my voice was really quiet when I said, \"Yes.\"\n\nAnd then Vanessa just\u2026 hugged me. A really long, tight hug. And I started to cry.\n\nIt wasn't a sad cry, exactly. It was more like a release. A release of all the fear and anxiety and uncertainty I'd been holding onto.\n\nIt was a moment of acceptance. A moment of letting go.\n\nAnd it was a moment of realizing that I wasn't alone. That I had people who cared about me, and who were going to support me through this.\n\nIt was a scary moment, but it was also a beautiful moment. It was a moment that made me feel stronger. And it was a moment that confirmed that I was making the right decision.\n\nIt just\u2026 it hit me then, you know? This was it. This was really happening. And I was going to be okay. We were all going to be okay. It was just\u2026 a lot. A whole lot. And I'm still processing it, honestly. But Vanessa asking that question\u2026 it was a turning point. It was a moment I won't forget.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That whole situation was\u2026 a mess.\n\nOkay, so, picture this: I'm trying to have a normal conversation with Bleeker, trying to figure out if we even *have* a normal conversation to have, and then *that* happens. Vijay, the human encyclopedia, just casually drops a bomb like that.\n\nMy first reaction was just\u2026 disbelief. Like, did I hear him right? Was he serious?\n\nAnd then I got angry. Really angry. It wasn't about whether it was Bleeker's or not, it was about the audacity of him to bring it up in the first place. It was my business, and it was incredibly inappropriate.\n\nI wanted to just yell at him, to tell him to mind his own business. But I didn't. I just\u2026 stared at him. And then I said, very calmly, \"That's a really inappropriate thing to say.\"\n\nBleeker, thankfully, was mortified. He immediately shut Vijay down and apologized to me. Which was good. But the damage was already done.\n\nIt just\u2026 highlighted how awkward and complicated everything was. It reminded me that everyone was talking about me, judging me, speculating about my life.\n\nAnd it made me feel even more vulnerable. Like I had no control over the situation.\n\nIt was a really uncomfortable moment. And it's a moment I wish I could forget. But I can't. It's just\u2026 burned into my memory.\n\nHonestly, Vijay is a smart guy, but sometimes he just doesn't get it. He doesn't understand social cues. He doesn't understand boundaries. And he definitely doesn't understand the complexities of human relationships.\n\nSo yeah. That was a terrible moment. And it's a reminder that sometimes, people just say things they shouldn't. And that you can't control what other people do, you can only control how you react. And I tried to react with as much dignity as possible, even though I was seething inside. It was\u2026 a lot.", "(Rolls eyes so hard I think I pulled a muscle) Oh. *Vijay*. Don't even get me started on Vijay.\n\nHonestly? I almost choked on my Sunny D. The audacity! The sheer, unadulterated\u2026 Vijay-ness of it all.\n\nI mean, seriously? A mustache equals manhood? Is that what he actually thinks? It's like he's stuck in a 1950s sitcom.\n\nI just stared at him for a good ten seconds, trying to process what he'd said. Then I said, very slowly, \"You're suggesting that growing facial hair will magically transform you into a responsible adult?\"\n\nHe just nodded, all serious. Like it was the most logical thing in the world.\n\nI couldn't help but laugh. It was a nervous, slightly hysterical laugh, but still. It was just so ridiculous.\n\nI told him, \"Vijay, you could grow a beard down to your knees and it still wouldn't change the fact that you're a clueless, immature\u2026 well, you.\"\n\nHe didn't get it. He actually looked offended. Which, honestly, just made me laugh even harder.\n\nIt was just\u2026 peak Vijay. Always trying to be something he's not. Always trying to impress people. Always failing miserably.\n\nAnd honestly, it was kind of endearing. In a really annoying way.\n\nBut yeah. A mustache? Really? That's his solution? It's just\u2026 ugh. It's Vijay. What can you do? You just have to accept that he's going to be Vijay. And sometimes, that means dealing with his ridiculous ideas about masculinity. It's exhausting, but it's also\u2026 kind of funny. In a train wreck sort of way.", "(Sighs, rolling my eyes) Oh. *That* note. Seriously? You're asking about *that* note? Okay, fine.\n\nIt wasn't a deep, philosophical message or anything. It was\u2026 a recipe.\n\nSpecifically, it was my attempt to recreate Vanessa's amazing chocolate chip cookies. She made them when we had dinner at their house, and they were seriously life-changing.\n\nI tried to write down all the ingredients and instructions, but I'm not exactly a master baker. So it was a little bit messy and incomplete.\n\nI left it on the kitchen counter with a note that said, \"Operation: Cookie Replication. Please advise.\" And a little drawing of a cookie with heart eyes.\n\nI was hoping she'd see it and maybe give me some tips. I wanted to surprise her with a batch of cookies as a thank you for everything.\n\nShe thought it was really sweet, apparently. She said it was the most Juno thing ever. Which, honestly, is probably true.\n\nIt wasn't a grand gesture or anything, but it was my way of showing her how much I appreciated her. And it was a way of trying to connect with her on a personal level.\n\nSo yeah. That's what the note was for. It was a recipe. And a little bit of gratitude. And a whole lot of me. Don't judge my baking skills, okay? They're a work in progress.", "Oh, man. That's\u2026 a big thing. It's about Van and Mark, right? The couple who are adopting the baby?\n\nI was *terrified* they'd fall apart. Like, what if they realized they weren't ready for a baby? What if they started fighting? What if they got divorced?\n\nIt wasn't about *them* not being good people. They were amazing. It was about\u2026 me. I was putting so much hope and trust into them. I was relying on them to give the baby a good life. And I was scared that they wouldn't be able to do it.\n\nI kept overanalyzing everything. Every little disagreement, every slightly awkward moment. I was convinced it was a sign that they were going to fall apart.\n\nBren kept telling me to relax, that they were a strong couple and that they had thought this through. But I couldn't help it. I was so worried about the baby, and about making the right decision.\n\nI think it was also about my own fear of abandonment. My mom left when I was little, and I was scared that Van and Mark would do the same.\n\nIt was stupid, I know. But I couldn't shake the feeling. I just wanted the baby to be safe and loved. And I wanted Van and Mark to be happy.\n\nIt took a lot of trust, and a lot of reassurance, to finally let go of my fears. And even now, I still worry about them sometimes. But I know that they're good people, and that they're going to be amazing parents. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's a big responsibility, giving your baby to someone else. And you want to be sure that they're going to be there for the long haul. You want to be sure that they're going to stay together. It's a natural thing to worry about, I guess. But it was definitely a huge concern for me. A really huge one.", "(Sighs, a little softer this time) Okay, that's\u2026 a good question. It's not like I'm surrounded by people showering me with affection, you know? But there are a few.\n\nFirst, and most obviously, my **dad, Mac.** He's\u2026 not the most emotionally expressive guy, but he loves me. He always has. He doesn't always *understand* me, but he supports me. He lets me be me, even when I'm being a sarcastic, cynical mess. He just\u2026 accepts me. And that means a lot.\n\nThen there's **Bren**, my stepmom. She's\u2026 amazing. She's the one who really *sees* me. She doesn't judge me, she listens to me, and she challenges me to be a better person. She loves me for all my flaws and imperfections. And she's been my rock through everything. Honestly, I don't know where I'd be without her.\n\nAnd\u2026 even though things are complicated right now, **Leah** used to. She *did* love me for who I was. Before everything happened. I hope we can get back to that. She knew all my weird quirks and my bad habits, and she loved me anyway. She just\u2026 got me.\n\nThose are the people who truly love me for exactly who I am. They don't try to change me, they don't try to mold me into something I'm not. They just\u2026 accept me. And that's the most important thing. It's a good feeling, knowing that there are people in the world who love you for you. Even when you're a mess. Especially when you're a mess. It makes facing everything a little bit easier. A little bit less scary.", "(Sighs) Okay, here we go. The big question. It's not like I haven't thought about this a million times already.\n\nAfter the ultrasound\u2026 well, it's not like everything magically changes. It's still the same plan. I'm still choosing adoption with Mark and Vanessa. That hasn't changed.\n\nBut\u2026 seeing the baby on the screen, actually *seeing* it\u2026 that's going to be different. It's going to be real, in a way it hasn't been before.\n\nI'm going to spend some time processing. Talking to Bren, talking to my dad. Just\u2026 trying to wrap my head around everything.\n\nI'm going to start making more concrete plans with the adoption agency. Discussing the details of the open adoption, and what that will look like.\n\nI'm going to try to prepare myself emotionally for saying goodbye. Which is going to be the hardest part.\n\nI'm also going to try to focus on the positive. On the fact that I'm giving this baby a chance at a good life. A life that I can't provide right now.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be heartbreaking. But it's the right thing to do.\n\nI'm not going to pretend it's going to be a smooth process. There will be tears, and doubts, and moments where I question everything.\n\nBut I'm determined to do this with grace and courage. And I'm determined to make the best decision for everyone involved.\n\nSo yeah. After the ultrasound, I'm going to keep moving forward. I'm going to keep planning. And I'm going to keep reminding myself that I'm doing this for the baby. And that's what matters most. It's just\u2026 a lot. It's a lot to handle. But I'll get through it. I have to.", "Ugh. Okay, this is the thing that gets under my skin the *most*. The judgment. It's relentless.\n\nHonestly? It sucks. It really, really sucks.\n\nPeople think they have the right to an opinion on my life. They think they know what's best for me. They look at me like I'm some kind of monster for not wanting to raise a baby right now.\n\nThey say things like, \"How could you give up your own child?\" or \"You'll regret it for the rest of your life.\" or \"You're being selfish.\"\n\nAnd it's just\u2026 infuriating.\n\nThey don't understand. They don't know my situation. They don't know what I'm going through. They don't know how much thought and consideration I've put into this decision.\n\nI'm not giving the baby *up*. I'm giving the baby *to* a loving family who is ready and able to provide for him or her. I'm making a selfless decision, even though it's incredibly painful.\n\nAnd it's not selfish to want to finish school and pursue my own dreams. It's not selfish to want to be a good parent someday, when I'm actually ready to be one.\n\nI try to ignore the judgment. I try to focus on the positive. I try to remember that I'm doing what's best for everyone involved.\n\nBut it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nBren has been amazing about it. She reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I don't need to listen to the haters.\n\nBut it still stings. It still hurts.\n\nI just wish people would be more understanding. More compassionate. More willing to see things from my perspective.\n\nIt's my life. My decision. And I don't need anyone's approval. But it would be nice if people could just\u2026 be supportive. Is that too much to ask?\n\nSeriously. It's my body, my choice, and my life. And I'm doing the best I can. And that's all that matters.", "Okay, this is\u2026 hard to talk about. It's not that I don't *trust* Mark and Vanessa. They seem really wonderful. Truly. But it's my baby, you know? And it's impossible not to have some worries.\n\nThe biggest thing is just\u2026 making sure they understand. That they understand this wasn't a casual decision. That I put a lot of thought into this, and that it's incredibly painful for me. I want them to know how much I love this baby, even though I'm not going to be raising him or her.\n\nI worry about them being too\u2026 perfect. They seem so put-together, so stable. And I'm a mess. I'm scared that they'll judge me, or think I'm not a good person. I want them to understand that I'm doing this because I want what's best for the baby, not because I don't care.\n\nI also worry about them keeping me in the loop. They've promised to send updates and pictures, but I'm scared that they'll eventually fade away. That the baby will grow up and not know anything about me. It's selfish, I know, but it's a fear I can't shake.\n\nAnd I worry about them being able to handle the challenges of parenthood. It's not always easy. There will be sleepless nights, and tantrums, and illnesses. I want to make sure they're prepared for all of that.\n\nI've talked to them about all of these concerns, and they've been really understanding. They've reassured me that they'll do everything they can to make sure I'm a part of the baby's life. But it's still hard to let go.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's my baby. And even though I know I'm making the right decision, it doesn't make it any easier. It's a constant battle between wanting what's best for the baby and wanting to hold onto him or her forever. It's complicated. Really complicated. And honestly, it's something I'm going to be grappling with for a long time.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me *started* on the ultrasound technician. Seriously. Like I needed another lecture on responsible decision-making while someone's poking around inside me. It was awful.\n\nHonestly? It makes me furious. Like, who are they to judge me? They don't know my life. They don't know my circumstances. They don't know what's best for me and for the baby.\n\nAt first, I tried to be polite. I tried to explain my reasoning. But it just felt like I was justifying myself to people who weren't interested in understanding.\n\nSo now, I just shut it down. I give them a look. A really icy, \"don't you dare\" look. And if they persist, I just walk away.\n\nIt's not easy. It's really hard to stand up for yourself when someone is trying to make you feel guilty or ashamed. But I have to do it. I have to protect myself.\n\nBren has been really helpful with this. She reminds me that I'm making the right decision, and that I don't need anyone's approval. She tells me to ignore the haters and to focus on what's important.\n\nAnd I try to remember that their comments are about *them*, not about me. They're projecting their own fears and insecurities onto me.\n\nIt's also helpful to remember that I'm not alone. There are other people who have made the same decision as me. And there are people who support me.\n\nSo yeah. I handle the defensive comments by shutting them down, protecting myself, and remembering that I'm doing the best I can. It's not always easy, but it's necessary. And it's a reminder that I'm strong enough to make my own choices, even when those choices are unpopular. And honestly, I'm done apologizing for trying to do what's right. For everyone involved.", "(A long pause. A quiet sigh.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 that's a hard one to talk about. It's not like anything I've ever felt before.\n\nThe first time\u2026 it was just\u2026 a blurry image. A little speck on a screen. But Dr. Chen pointed things out \u2013 the tiny heartbeat, the little limbs. And suddenly, it wasn't just a speck anymore. It was\u2026 a person.\n\nIt was terrifying. And overwhelming. And incredibly sad. Because I knew I wasn't going to be able to keep it.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 beautiful. It was amazing. To see something so small and fragile, and to know that it was growing inside of me.\n\nI felt\u2026 connected. Like there was this tiny little life inside me, and it was already a part of me. Even though I knew I was making the right decision, it didn't make it any easier.\n\nI cried. A lot. Silent tears, just streaming down my face.\n\nAnd I felt\u2026 guilty. Like I was letting someone down. Like I was failing as a mother.\n\nBut then I remembered Mark and Vanessa. And I remembered that they were going to be amazing parents. And I realized that I was giving this baby a chance at a good life.\n\nSo the sadness was mixed with\u2026 hope. And relief. And a strange sense of peace.\n\nIt was a lot of emotions, all at once. It was confusing and overwhelming and heartbreaking.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 a miracle. To see a life growing inside of me. It was a reminder that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, there is still beauty and wonder in the world.\n\nIt's a moment I'll never forget. And it's a moment that has changed me forever. It's\u2026 complicated. It just is. It's a lot. And it's something I'm still trying to process. But it's real. And it matters. A lot.", "(Rolls eyes) Ugh. Seriously? *Still* with the Tic Tacs? It's been, like, forever.\n\nOkay, fine. I'll tell you. But don't judge. It was a moment of\u2026 heightened emotion.\n\nBleeker was being a total weirdo. He was all clingy and awkward and just\u2026 *a lot*. And he kept leaving me these really intense, overly-romantic notes. It was creepy.\n\nI just wanted him to leave me alone. But I didn't want to be mean. I didn't want to hurt his feelings.\n\nSo I came up with a plan. A brilliant plan, if I do say so myself.\n\nI filled his mailbox with Tic Tacs. Like, a *lot* of Tic Tacs. Enough to fill the entire mailbox.\n\nIt was a passive-aggressive way of saying, \"Back off.\" It was a way of sending a message without actually having to confront him.\n\nAnd it worked! He got the hint. He stopped leaving me notes. He stopped following me around. He just\u2026 disappeared.\n\nIt was a little bit childish, I admit. But it was effective. And it made me feel better.\n\nPlus, it was kind of funny. Imagine opening your mailbox and being bombarded with a tidal wave of tiny mints.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I put so many Tic Tacs in Bleeker's mailbox. It was a moment of desperation. A moment of teenage angst. A moment of\u2026 Tic Tac-fueled rebellion.\n\nAnd honestly? I don't regret it. It was a classic move. Don't @ me.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Don't even get me started. That whole thing was\u2026 a mess. A beautifully awkward, teenage mess.\n\nOkay, so after I basically blurted out my feelings to him at the arcade, it was\u2026 weird. Really weird. Like, walking on eggshells levels of weird.\n\nHe didn't exactly *reject* me, which was\u2026 something. But he didn't exactly reciprocate, either. He just kind of\u2026 froze. And then mumbled something about needing to practice his guitar.\n\nFor a while, we just avoided each other. It was super awkward at school. We'd make eye contact and then quickly look away. It was like we were both pretending the whole thing never happened.\n\nThen, slowly, we started talking again. But it wasn't the same. There was this\u2026 distance between us. Like he was afraid to say the wrong thing. And I was afraid to bring it up again.\n\nHe was still sweet, and he still made me laugh. But it was different. It was like we were friends, but not *friends*. You know?\n\nI realized that he just wasn't ready for a relationship. He was still figuring things out, and he wasn't emotionally available. And that was okay. It was disappointing, but it was okay.\n\nEventually, we just kind of drifted apart. We still talked occasionally, but we weren't as close as we used to be.\n\nIt was a good lesson, though. It taught me that you can't force someone to feel something they don't feel. And it taught me that sometimes, the best thing you can do is to let go.\n\nIt hurt, for a while. But I got over it. And I realized that I deserved someone who felt the same way about me. Someone who wasn't afraid to be vulnerable.\n\nSo yeah. Our relationship changed after I confessed my feelings. It became more distant, more awkward, and eventually, it faded away. But it was a valuable experience. And it helped me to grow up. And honestly, looking back, it was kinda funny. In a painful, teenage kind of way.", "(Sighs, rolling eyes a little) Okay, seriously? You're asking me about the chalk message? That feels\u2026 intensely personal. But alright, I'll bite.\n\nIt wasn't just a random act of teenage angst, okay? It was\u2026 complicated.\n\nBleeker was\u2026 well, he was Bleeker. Kind of clueless, kind of sweet, and definitely not the guy I thought I'd end up connecting with. But he *listened*. He actually listened to me, even when I was being weird and sarcastic.\n\nAnd when I found out I was pregnant, he was\u2026 surprisingly supportive. He didn't freak out, he didn't judge me, he just\u2026 offered to be there for me.\n\nBut I knew he wasn't the one. He wasn't the father I wanted for the baby. And I knew he deserved someone who could give him their whole heart.\n\nSo the chalk message\u2026 it was my way of saying goodbye. It was my way of letting him know that I appreciated his kindness, but that we couldn't be together.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do, I know. But it felt right at the time. It was a way of being honest, without having to have a difficult conversation.\n\nAnd it was a way of acknowledging the connection we had, even if it wasn't meant to be.\n\nThe message itself\u2026 it was just a quote from a Van Morrison song. \"And it's you, and it's me, and it's all we need.\" But it was also a way of saying, \"It's not enough.\"\n\nIt was a messy, complicated, teenage kind of goodbye. And it was a way of moving on. It was a way of closing that chapter of my life and starting a new one.\n\nSo yeah. The chalk message. It was a small gesture, but it meant a lot. It was a way of saying goodbye to Bleeker, and to a part of myself. And it was a way of moving forward, towards the future. It was\u2026 a thing I did. A weird, chalky thing I did.", "Ugh, okay, don't even get me started on Bleeker. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nLook, he's a good guy. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely a little bit of a dork. And he *tried*. He really did. He wanted to be supportive, and he wanted to do the right thing.\n\nBut honestly? His support was\u2026 awkward. Like, he'd show up with flowers and mix CDs, and try to be all sensitive and understanding. Which was nice, I guess. But it also felt\u2026 performative. Like he was trying to prove something to himself, or to other people.\n\nHe didn't really *get* it. He didn't understand the weight of the decision I was making. He didn't understand the emotional toll it was taking on me. He just wanted to fix things, to make everything okay. But you can't fix this.\n\nAnd he kept trying to convince me to keep the baby. Which, I appreciate that he was willing to step up, but it wasn't what *I* wanted. It wasn't what was best for anyone.\n\nHe meant well, but his support felt more like pressure. Like he was trying to guilt me into doing what *he* wanted, instead of respecting my decision.\n\nBren, on the other hand, she was amazing. She listened without judgment. She asked the hard questions. She helped me explore my options. She supported me no matter what I decided.\n\nSo, yeah. Bleeker's support was\u2026 well-intentioned, but ultimately unhelpful. It made me realize that support isn't just about showing up with gifts and saying the right things. It's about truly listening and understanding. And it's about respecting someone's autonomy.\n\nHe's a good guy, but he wasn't the right kind of support for me. And I think he eventually realized that too. It just took him a while to get there. It was\u2026 a learning experience for both of us, I guess. A really awkward, uncomfortable learning experience.", "Ugh, okay, this is a question I get a lot. And it's not like I have some deep, philosophical reason. It's just\u2026 I didn't want to.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 adding another layer of expectation. Like, if I knew it was a boy, I'd start imagining him playing baseball and getting into trouble. And if I knew it was a girl, I'd start imagining her with ribbons in her hair and tea parties.\n\nAnd I didn't want to start building a life for this baby in my head before the baby was even born. I wanted to be surprised. I wanted to meet the baby and then figure out who they were, instead of trying to fit them into a pre-conceived idea.\n\nPlus, Bren said it would be a good surprise for Mark and Vanessa. And honestly, I wanted to give them something special. Something that was just for them.\n\nIt wasn't about being mysterious or dramatic. It was just about wanting to keep things open. About wanting to be surprised. About wanting to let the baby be who they are, without any expectations.\n\nIt felt like\u2026 a way to give the baby a little bit of freedom. A little bit of space to be themselves.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm glad I did it. It's been nice not knowing. It's added a little bit of mystery to the whole process. And it's made the anticipation even more exciting.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I didn't find out the gender. It wasn't a big decision, but it was the right one for me. And for the baby. I think. Hopefully. It's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But it's good weird. You know?", "(Eyes widen, a slight shudder runs through me)\n\nOkay, *who* came up with that term? \"Scary neuter-baby?\" Seriously? That's\u2026 deeply unsettling.\n\nLook, I get what Paulie is trying to say. It's about the baby being different, about it not fitting into traditional family structures. And yeah, it's a little bit weird to think about a baby being raised by a couple who can't have kids.\n\nBut \"scary?\" \"Neuter?\" Those words are just\u2026 harsh. And insensitive.\n\nIt's not about the baby being \"scary.\" It's about the baby being loved. And cherished. And given a good home.\n\nMark and Vanessa are amazing people. They're kind, they're compassionate, and they're incredibly excited about becoming parents. They're not going to raise a \"scary\" baby. They're going to raise a happy, healthy, well-adjusted child.\n\nAnd honestly, the idea that a baby needs a traditional mom and dad to be okay is just\u2026 outdated. Families come in all shapes and sizes. What matters is the love and support that a child receives.\n\nSo, no. I don't think there's any such thing as a \"scary neuter-baby.\" It's a ridiculous and offensive term. And I wish Paulie would just keep his opinions to himself.\n\nSeriously. Some people just don't get it. They're stuck in their own little world, and they can't see beyond their own prejudices. And it's frustrating. And it's hurtful.\n\nBut I'm not going to let his negativity ruin my day. I'm going to focus on the positive. I'm going to focus on the fact that this baby is going to be loved and cared for. And I'm going to focus on the fact that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nEven if it means dealing with clueless people like Paulie. Ugh. He's the worst.", "Ugh. Bleeker. Okay, look. He's\u2026 a lot.\n\nHe's sweet, I guess. And he's definitely enthusiastic. Like, *really* enthusiastic. About everything. Especially me, which is\u2026 flattering, I suppose. But also kinda overwhelming.\n\nWe bonded over music, which is good. He's a really talented guitar player. And he's genuinely a nice guy. He's just\u2026 a little bit clueless.\n\nHe's not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed, you know? He says things without thinking, and he doesn't always understand sarcasm. Which can be\u2026 frustrating.\n\nI think he likes me more than I like him. Which is awkward. I mean, I like him as a friend. But I don't think I see him as anything more than that.\n\nHe's always trying to impress me, which is kinda sweet, but also kinda annoying. He's always showing off his guitar skills, or trying to make me laugh with his goofy jokes.\n\nI appreciate his support, though. He's been really good about being there for me during all of this. He doesn't judge me, and he always tries to make me feel better.\n\nBut honestly? It's complicated. He's a good guy, but we're just\u2026 different. We have different interests, different personalities, different goals.\n\nI think he's a little bit too intense for me. I need someone who's a little more laid-back, a little more sarcastic, a little more\u2026 me.\n\nSo yeah. That's my relationship with Bleeker. It's complicated. It's sweet. It's awkward. And it's probably not going to go anywhere. But I appreciate him as a friend. And I hope he finds someone who appreciates him for who he is. Someone who can handle all of his enthusiasm. Because I definitely can't.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a big one. It's not what I expected, honestly. I thought my dad would freak out. I thought Bren would be disappointed. I thought everyone would judge me.\n\nBut they didn't.\n\nMy dad, Mac, he was\u2026 quiet at first. He didn't say much, but he held my hand a lot. And he made me pancakes. A lot of pancakes. It was his way of showing he cared. He just wanted me to be okay.\n\nAnd Bren\u2026 Bren was amazing. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she didn't lecture me, she just listened. She asked me what *I* wanted to do. She helped me research my options. She went with me to appointments. She just\u2026 supported me, no matter what.\n\nShe was the one who suggested adoption. She didn't push me, but she helped me see that it was a viable option. And she helped me find Mark and Vanessa.\n\nShe also took care of everything at home. She made sure I was eating healthy, getting enough sleep, and keeping up with school. She shielded me from a lot of the stress and anxiety.\n\nIt wasn't always easy. There were definitely moments of tension and disagreement. But overall, they were incredibly supportive.\n\nThey didn't always understand what I was going through, but they tried. And they loved me unconditionally.\n\nI'm so grateful for them. I don't know what I would have done without them. They made a really difficult situation a little bit easier.\n\nThey showed me that family isn't just about blood. It's about love and support and being there for each other, no matter what.\n\nAnd honestly, I think this whole experience has brought us closer together. It's made me appreciate my family even more. They're not perfect, but they're my family. And I love them. A lot. They really stepped up, and I'll never forget that. It was\u2026 everything.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't pretty, honestly. It was a lot of flailing and sarcasm and trying to pretend I was fine when I definitely wasn't.\n\nBut looking back, I think the biggest thing that helped me was\u2026 letting myself *feel* things. Which sounds cheesy, I know. But I'm usually really good at bottling everything up, at putting on a brave face. But that just doesn't work when you're dealing with something this big.\n\nI started writing poetry, which was a way to get my feelings out without having to actually talk to anyone. It was a safe space to be honest and vulnerable.\n\nAnd I started talking to Bren. She was the only one who really understood what I was going through. She didn't judge me, she didn't try to fix me, she just listened. And she asked the hard questions.\n\nIt was also really hard to confront the fact that I didn't really know who I was anymore. I'd always defined myself by my sarcasm and my independence. But suddenly, those things didn't feel like enough. I felt lost and confused and\u2026 empty.\n\nI realized that I needed to figure out what *really* mattered to me. What were my values? What were my passions? What did I want out of life?\n\nIt took a lot of soul-searching. A lot of questioning. A lot of self-reflection.\n\nAnd it wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears. A lot of anger. A lot of self-doubt.\n\nBut eventually, I started to piece things together. I realized that I was stronger than I thought I was. I realized that I was capable of making difficult decisions. And I realized that I was okay with not having all the answers.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nIt was a messy process. But it was a necessary one. And it helped me to grow as a person. It helped me to figure out who I am, and what I want out of life.\n\nSo yeah. Emotional vulnerability and an identity crisis. It wasn't fun. But it was a learning experience. And it made me who I am today. A little bit broken, a little bit cynical, but also a little bit stronger and a little bit more hopeful. And that's okay. That's more than okay. It's\u2026 good.", "Okay, look. I've mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. It's not even a question. My favorite band, hands down, is **The Moldy Peaches.**\n\nSeriously. Don't judge.\n\nThey're not mainstream. They're not polished. They're just\u2026 real. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson write these incredibly honest and quirky songs that just\u2026 get me.\n\nTheir lyrics are funny, heartbreaking, and surprisingly profound. They're about love, loss, loneliness, and the absurdity of life. They're about being an outsider, and finding your place in the world.\n\nAnd their music is just\u2026 unique. It's a mix of indie rock, folk, and anti-folk. It's raw and unpretentious. It's not trying to be anything it's not.\n\nI discovered them when I was going through a really tough time, and their music just\u2026 spoke to me. It made me feel less alone. It made me feel like it was okay to be weird. It made me feel like it was okay to be myself.\n\nTheir song \"Anyone Else But You\" is basically my anthem. It's about the pain of unrequited love, but it's also about the importance of self-respect.\n\nAnd their song \"Lucky\" is just\u2026 perfect. It's a simple, beautiful song about finding happiness in the small things.\n\nI've seen them live a few times, and their concerts are amazing. They're intimate and energetic and just\u2026 fun.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. They're the band that understands me. They're the band that makes me feel alive. And they're the band that I'll probably be listening to for the rest of my life. Don't even try to tell me they're not good. You'll regret it. Seriously.", "(Sighs) Is the Pope Catholic? Seriously? It's like\u2026 the understatement of the century.\n\nIt's *incredibly* challenging. Like, exponentially challenging. It's not just about being a teenager, and it's not just about being pregnant. It's about being both at the same time.\n\nBeing a teenager is already confusing enough. You're trying to figure out who you are, what you want, what you believe in. You're dealing with hormones and peer pressure and all that jazz.\n\nAnd then you throw pregnancy into the mix, and it's like\u2026 everything gets turned upside down. Suddenly, you're not just responsible for yourself anymore. You're responsible for another human being.\n\nIt's a lot of pressure. It's a lot of responsibility. And it's a lot of uncertainty.\n\nI feel like I'm constantly questioning myself. Am I making the right decisions? Am I doing enough? Am I going to be a good mom, even though I'm not even a grown-up yet?\n\nAnd it's hard to navigate my identity when everything is changing so quickly. I'm not just Juno MacGuff anymore. I'm Juno MacGuff, the pregnant teenager. And that feels\u2026 limiting.\n\nI want to be seen as more than just that. I want to be seen as a person with dreams and aspirations and a sense of humor. But it's hard to get people to see past the pregnancy.\n\nIt's a constant struggle. A constant balancing act. And honestly, I'm still figuring it out.\n\nBut I'm trying. I'm trying to stay true to myself. I'm trying to make the best decisions I can. And I'm trying to find a way to navigate this whole thing with grace and courage.\n\nIt's not easy. But it's worth it. Because even though it's challenging, it's also an opportunity for growth. And it's an opportunity to learn more about myself and about the world. And that's something I'm grateful for. Even if it's a really messy, complicated kind of gratitude.", "Ugh, okay. Deep thoughts time. This isn't exactly a fun topic, but\u2026 it's the truth.\n\nBefore all this happened, I thought I knew what love was. Like, romantic love, family love, friend love. It was all pretty abstract. Feelings, you know?\n\nBut going through this\u2026 it completely changed my understanding of it.\n\nLove isn't just a feeling. It's a *choice*. It's a decision to put someone else's needs before your own. It's about sacrifice. It's about doing what's best for someone, even when it's hard.\n\nChoosing adoption wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the most loving thing I could do for the baby. It was about recognizing that I wasn't ready to be a parent, and that there were people who could give the baby a better life.\n\nAnd seeing Mark and Vanessa\u2026 seeing how excited they were, how much they wanted this baby\u2026 it showed me a different kind of love. A love that's patient, and kind, and selfless.\n\nIt also taught me a lot about responsibility. Before, responsibility meant doing my homework and cleaning my room. But this was a whole different level. This was about bringing a life into the world, and making sure that life was safe and happy.\n\nIt was about taking ownership of my actions, and facing the consequences. It was about being accountable for my choices.\n\nAnd it was about realizing that even though I wasn't going to be the baby's mother, I still had a responsibility to make sure that the baby was loved and cared for.\n\nSo yeah. This journey completely reshaped my understanding of love and responsibility. It taught me that love isn't just about feelings, it's about actions. And it taught me that responsibility isn't just about doing what's easy, it's about doing what's right.\n\nIt's been messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also been incredibly rewarding. And it's made me a stronger, more compassionate, and more responsible person. And honestly, I wouldn't trade that for anything. Even if it means going through all the hard stuff. It just\u2026 changed me. For the better, I think.", "(A long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 that's a hard question. It's not like anything I expected.\n\nI knew, logically, what to expect. I'd gone to all the appointments, I'd read all the books. But nothing could have prepared me for actually *seeing* him.\n\nIt was\u2026 overwhelming. A wave of emotions just washed over me. Relief, sadness, joy, fear\u2026 it was all mixed up together.\n\nHe was so small. So fragile. And so\u2026 perfect.\n\nHe had these tiny little fingers and toes, and a little button nose. And he was making these little noises, these little grunts and sighs.\n\nAnd I just\u2026 stared at him. For a long time.\n\nI wasn't supposed to hold him, not yet. Mark and Vanessa wanted to have that first moment. But I just wanted to reach out and touch him. To feel his skin against mine.\n\nIt was\u2026 heartbreaking. Knowing that I was giving him up. Knowing that I wouldn't be the one to raise him.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 beautiful. Knowing that he was going to have a loving home. Knowing that he was going to be cared for and cherished.\n\nI remember looking at Mark and Vanessa, and seeing the love in their eyes. And I knew that I was making the right decision.\n\nIt didn't make it easy, though. It was still the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nBut in that moment, seeing him for the first time\u2026 I felt a connection. A bond. A love that I didn't even know was possible.\n\nIt was a bittersweet moment. A moment of joy and sorrow. A moment that I'll never forget.\n\nIt was\u2026 everything. It was the culmination of everything I'd been through. And it was the beginning of a new chapter. For him. And for me.\n\n(Another pause. A small sniffle.)\n\nIt was\u2026 good. It was really, really good. Even though it hurt like hell. It was just\u2026 good.", "Ugh. Paulie. Okay, look. That was\u2026 complicated. And honestly, it was a really stupid decision, but I was a mess, alright?\n\nIt wasn't about *not* liking Paulie. He's a good guy. A really good guy. Sweet, kind, a little clueless, but good. It was about\u2026 fear.\n\nI was terrified of ruining things with him. He had his whole life planned out \u2013 music school, band practice, college. And I didn't want to drag him down with me. I didn't want to mess up his future.\n\nI thought if I just handled it on my own, if I just kept it a secret, it would be easier for everyone. I was wrong, obviously.\n\nI was also scared of what he would think of me. I was already feeling so much shame and guilt, and I didn't want him to judge me. I didn't want him to see me as\u2026 irresponsible.\n\nI know it was selfish. I should have told him. He deserved to know. But I was just so caught up in my own head, so overwhelmed by everything, that I couldn't bring myself to do it.\n\nI thought I was protecting him. But really, I was just protecting myself.\n\nIt was a mistake. A big one. And I regret it. But at the time, it felt like the only option. I was just a kid, trying to navigate a really difficult situation. And I made a bad decision.\n\nIt took a lot of courage to finally tell him, and it was awkward and uncomfortable. But it was also a relief. And I'm glad I did it, eventually. Even if it didn't turn out the way I hoped.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I didn't tell him. Fear. Selfishness. And a whole lot of teenage angst. It wasn't my finest moment, but it was a learning experience. And I'm trying to move on. It's just\u2026 hard.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. That was\u2026 a whole thing. A really frustrating thing.\n\nOkay, so, it wasn't that Paulie found out directly from *me*. I was very careful about that. I hadn't told anyone except my dad and Bren.\n\nIt was Su-Lin. That\u2026 well, let's just say Su-Lin has a big mouth. And a tendency to eavesdrop.\n\nShe overheard my dad talking to Bren on the phone. He was trying to arrange a meeting with Mark and Vanessa, and he mentioned the baby. And Su-Lin, being Su-Lin, immediately ran to Paulie and told him everything.\n\nI was furious. Absolutely furious. I wanted to strangle Su-Lin. But honestly, I was mostly just embarrassed. And scared.\n\nPaulie was\u2026 surprisingly understanding, actually. He was upset, of course. But he didn't freak out. He just wanted to know why I hadn't told him myself.\n\nAnd I didn't have a good answer. I was afraid of how he would react. I was afraid of ruining our friendship. I was just\u2026 scared.\n\nIt was a really difficult conversation. But it was also a turning point in our relationship. It forced me to be honest with him, and to trust him.\n\nSo yeah. Su-Lin. She's the reason Paulie found out. And I will never forgive her for that. Seriously. Never.\n\nIt was a mess. A complete and utter mess. But it all worked out in the end. Sort of. It's complicated. But that's the story. Su-Lin and her big mouth. That's all it takes to ruin everything, apparently.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big one, right? The question everyone wants to know the answer to. It wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I was sixteen. I had no idea what I was doing. I hadn't even figured out what I wanted to *be* yet, let alone how to raise a baby.\n\nI considered all my options. Abortion was\u2026 not something I could bring myself to do. It just didn't feel right. And keeping the baby\u2026 that felt even more impossible. I wasn't ready. I didn't have the resources. I didn't have the support system.\n\nI talked to my dad, and Bren. They were amazing. They didn't judge me. They just listened. And they helped me to think through my options.\n\nBren suggested adoption. And at first, I was hesitant. The thought of giving up my baby\u2026 it was heartbreaking.\n\nBut then I started to think about what was best for the baby. And I realized that I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved. I couldn't provide for it financially, emotionally, or practically.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a loving home, with parents who were ready and able to provide for it. I wanted the baby to have opportunities that I couldn't give it.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were just\u2026 wonderful. They were kind and compassionate and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They made me feel like they would love the baby unconditionally.\n\nAnd that's when I knew. Adoption was the right decision. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nIt was still incredibly difficult. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew that I was giving the baby a chance at a good life.\n\nAnd that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't a glamorous decision. It wasn't a heroic decision. It was just a responsible decision. And it was the right decision. For everyone involved.\n\nIt's still something I think about every day. But I'm at peace with it. I know that the baby is loved and cared for. And that's all that matters. It was about love, ultimately. And doing the hardest thing, because it was the right thing.", "(A long sigh, and a shift in posture. This one still stings.)\n\nUgh. Don't even get me started on Bleeker. Honestly, that kid\u2026\n\nIt wasn't about *not* wanting to be involved, exactly. It was more like\u2026 he just didn't want the responsibility. He was all excited about the idea of being a dad when we were, you know\u2026 making the situation. But then when it became real, when it became about actually *being* a dad, he freaked out.\n\nHe said he wasn't ready. He said he had too much going on with his music. He said he didn't want to mess up his life.\n\nIt was\u2026 disappointing. To say the least. I was hoping he'd be there for the baby, even if we weren't together. I was hoping he'd at least *try*.\n\nBut he didn't. He just\u2026 backed away.\n\nIt hurt, you know? It made me feel like I was doing this all alone. Like he didn't care about the baby, or about me.\n\nI tried to be understanding. I tried to see things from his perspective. But it was hard. It was really hard.\n\nI was angry at him, and I was angry at myself for ever thinking he'd be a good father.\n\nBut mostly, I was just sad. Sad that the baby wouldn't have a father who wanted to be involved in their life. Sad that Bleeker wasn't the person I thought he was.\n\nIt made me even more determined to find the perfect adoptive parents. Parents who would love the baby unconditionally, and who would be there for them no matter what.\n\nIt was a tough pill to swallow, but it also made me stronger. It made me realize that I didn't need Bleeker to be happy. I didn't need him to be a good parent. I could do this on my own.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm better off without him. He wasn't ready for this. And I deserve someone who is.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. It really sucked. But I'm moving on. And I'm focusing on finding the best possible future for the baby. And that's all that matters. It just\u2026 it still stings, okay? Don't make me talk about it anymore.", "(Takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment)\n\nOkay. That\u2026 that was a lot. It was everything I expected, and nothing like it at the same time.\n\nI\u2019d met Vanessa a bunch of times during the pregnancy, of course. We\u2019d talked, we\u2019d gone to appointments, we\u2019d gotten to know each other. But seeing her *with* the baby\u2026 it was different.\n\nShe looked\u2026 overwhelmed. In the best way possible. Her hair was a mess, she was wearing mismatched socks, and she had a smear of something (probably spit-up) on her cheek. She was trying to hold the baby and change a diaper and answer the nurse\u2019s questions all at the same time. It was beautiful chaos.\n\nAnd she was just\u2026 glowing. Like she\u2019d been waiting her whole life for this moment.\n\nI remember feeling this weird mix of emotions. Relief, mostly. And sadness, definitely. But also\u2026 joy. Seeing her so happy, so completely in love with the baby\u2026 it made me feel like I\u2019d made the right decision.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy, giving the baby up. It was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. But seeing Vanessa holding him, looking at him with such adoration\u2026 it made it all worth it.\n\nShe caught my eye and gave me this little smile. It wasn\u2019t a pitying smile, or a grateful smile. It was just\u2026 a smile. A smile that said, \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201d\n\nAnd I knew she meant it.\n\nIt was messy and disorganized and imperfect. Just like life. But it was also perfect. It was exactly as it should be.\n\nI walked out of the hospital feeling\u2026 lighter. Like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. And I knew, deep down, that the baby was going to be loved and cherished. And that was all that mattered.\n\nIt was\u2026 a good kind of messy. A happy kind of messy. And it\u2019s a memory I\u2019ll carry with me forever. It\u2019s a reminder that even in the midst of loss, there can be joy. And that sometimes, the greatest act of love is letting go.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on Bleeker. And that song. It's\u2026 complicated.\n\nOkay, look. \"Anyone Else But You\" by The Moldy Peaches? It wasn't just a song we both liked. It *was* our song. And that's\u2026 a problem.\n\nIt started as a joke, honestly. We were both being sarcastic and cynical, and the song just fit. It's about wanting someone, but also being terrified of getting hurt. It's about being too scared to let yourself be vulnerable.\n\nAnd that was us, perfectly encapsulated in a three-minute song.\n\nWe'd listen to it on repeat, and we'd make fun of it, and we'd pretend it wasn't actually about us. But it was. It totally was.\n\nIt was a way of acknowledging our feelings for each other without actually having to *talk* about them. It was a safe space. A way to connect without getting too close.\n\nBut it was also a self-fulfilling prophecy. The song is about wanting anyone else but the person you're actually with. And that's kind of what happened with us. We were so afraid of getting hurt that we sabotaged our own relationship.\n\nWe were both so stubborn and independent and afraid of commitment. We pushed each other away, even when we didn't want to.\n\nSo, the song\u2026 it's a reminder of what could have been. It's a reminder of the connection we had, and the connection we lost. It's a reminder of the fear that kept us apart.\n\nIt's a bittersweet song. It makes me smile, and it makes me sad, all at the same time.\n\nIt's a song that will always remind me of Bleeker. And it's a song that I'll probably never be able to listen to again without feeling a little bit heartbroken. It's just\u2026 a lot. It's a lot of feelings packed into one little song. And honestly, sometimes I wish we'd just picked a different one.", "Ugh, okay, let's talk about the elephant in the room, or, you know, the tiny human-shaped elephant. It's not exactly a surprise people are weirded out by the idea of a baby shower for me.\n\nIt's because I'm\u2026 giving the baby *up*. It's not like I'm keeping it. It's not a traditional situation.\n\nPeople are confused. They don't know how to react. They want to be supportive, but they're also afraid of saying the wrong thing. They don't want to seem like they're celebrating something that's actually really sad.\n\nAnd honestly, I get it. It *is* sad. It's a complicated situation. It's not something you throw a party for. Usually.\n\nBren explained it to me. She said people are trying to be respectful. They don't want to make me feel worse. They're just\u2026 unsure.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they're the ones who suggested it, actually. They said they wanted to celebrate the baby, and to show their appreciation for me. They said it wasn't about celebrating *my* motherhood, it was about celebrating the arrival of their child.\n\nBut a lot of other people are still hesitant. They're sending gifts directly to Mark and Vanessa, or offering to help in other ways. Which is nice. But it's not the same as a shower.\n\nIt's just\u2026 awkward. It's a reminder that this isn't a typical pregnancy. It's a reminder that I'm making a difficult decision. And it's a reminder that people don't really understand what I'm going through.\n\nSo yeah. That's why people are unsure about throwing me a baby shower. It's not about me, it's about the situation. And it's a situation that's a little bit messy, a little bit complicated, and a whole lot of heartbreaking. But we're making it work. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh, okay, this is still a sore spot. It's not like I was doing anything *wrong*, exactly. But Bren\u2026 she has a point. I just didn't see it at the time.\n\nIt wasn't about the movies or the CDs themselves. It was about the *relationship*. Mark and Vanessa are supposed to be my baby's parents, not\u2026 friends. Or potential\u2026 something else.\n\nBren said I was getting too comfortable with them. That I was blurring the lines. And she was right. I was.\n\nI was lonely, okay? And they were being so nice to me. They were treating me like a person, not just a pregnant teenager. They were listening to me, and they were making me laugh. And I just\u2026 wanted to feel normal.\n\nSo I started spending more time with them. Watching movies, listening to music, just talking. And I didn't realize that it was inappropriate. I didn't realize that it was creating a weird dynamic.\n\nBren said it was confusing for everyone involved. That it was making it harder to maintain a healthy distance. And she was right about that too.\n\nShe wasn't trying to be mean. She was just trying to protect me. And the baby. She was trying to make sure that everyone was on the same page.\n\nI was being selfish. I was focusing on my own needs, and I wasn't thinking about the bigger picture.\n\nIt was a mistake. And I apologized to Mark and Vanessa. And I promised Bren that it wouldn't happen again.\n\nI'm still learning how to navigate this whole situation. It's complicated. And I'm still making mistakes. But I'm trying to be more mindful of my actions. And I'm trying to respect the boundaries that Bren has set. Because she's right. She usually is. And she's looking out for me, even when I don't want her to. It's just\u2026 hard. It's all just really hard.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started on Bren. She's\u2026 well, she's complicated. And she has this weird thing about my mom, Renee.\n\nIt's not that she thinks I'm *stupid*, exactly. It's more that she thinks I'm naive. She thinks I don't understand the complexities of long-term relationships because I've never had one. And because my mom\u2026 well, my mom isn't exactly a role model for marital stability.\n\nRenee has been married, like, five times. And none of those marriages lasted very long. She's a free spirit, you know? She does what she wants, when she wants. And she doesn't really believe in commitment.\n\nBren thinks that Renee's lifestyle has warped my perception of relationships. She thinks I have unrealistic expectations. She thinks I believe in fairy tales and happily ever afters.\n\nAnd honestly? She's probably right. I *do* have a tendency to romanticize things. I *do* believe in the power of love. And I *do* think that people should be able to find someone who makes them truly happy.\n\nBut Bren thinks that's just\u2026 silly. She thinks that marriage is about compromise and sacrifice and hard work. She thinks it's about building a life together, even when it's not easy.\n\nShe's not wrong, of course. But I think she underestimates the importance of passion and connection. I think she believes that love is something you have to earn, rather than something you just\u2026 feel.\n\nIt's a generational thing, I guess. Bren is more practical and realistic. Renee is more idealistic and impulsive. And I'm somewhere in between.\n\nSo yeah. That's why Bren thinks I don't know anything about the dynamics of marriage. Because she thinks I've been raised by a woman who doesn't believe in it. And honestly? It's a little bit frustrating. But I also understand where she's coming from. She just wants to protect me from getting hurt. And I appreciate that, even if I don't always show it.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is still\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nIt wasn't one big thing, it was a lot of little things adding up. And a lot of really hard thinking.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026 scared. Completely and utterly terrified. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being. I wasn't ready. I knew I wasn't ready.\n\nI thought about all the things I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to finish school, I wanted to go to college, I wanted to travel. And I knew that having a baby would make all of that so much harder, if not impossible.\n\nBut it wasn't just about my own dreams. It was about what was best for the baby. I wanted the baby to have a good life. A stable life. A life filled with love and opportunity.\n\nAnd I knew that I couldn't provide that, not right now. I didn't have the financial resources, the emotional maturity, or the support system to raise a child.\n\nI talked to Bren a lot about it. She didn't pressure me to do anything. She just listened, and she asked me the hard questions. She helped me to see all the different options, and to weigh the pros and cons of each one.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were just\u2026 amazing. They were so kind and loving and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They made me feel like they would be able to give the baby everything it needed.\n\nAnd that's when I knew. I knew that giving the baby up for adoption was the right thing to do. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the best decision.\n\nIt was about putting the baby's needs first. It was about giving the baby a chance at a good life. And it was about being selfless, even when it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. But I know that I made the right choice. And I hope that the baby is happy and healthy and loved. That's all I want. Really. That's all I've ever wanted.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breath. That's\u2026 a lot. This whole thing has been a crash course in, well, *everything*. But if I had to boil it down\u2026 I learned I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was.\n\nSeriously. Before this, I was just\u2026 a sarcastic teenager who liked music and vintage clothes. I didn't really have to deal with anything serious. I didn't have to make any big decisions.\n\nBut this\u2026 this forced me to grow up. It forced me to confront my fears and to take responsibility for my actions.\n\nI learned that I'm capable of making difficult choices, even when they're heartbreaking. I learned that I can be selfless, even when it's hard. And I learned that I can handle a lot more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI also learned that I'm not afraid to ask for help. I used to be so independent, so determined to do everything on my own. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, and even, eventually, Leah.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to show your emotions. It's okay to admit that you're scared and confused.\n\nI also learned a lot about myself as a person. I learned what's important to me. I learned what I value. And I learned what I'm willing to fight for.\n\nThis journey hasn't been easy. It's been messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also been incredibly rewarding.\n\nIt's made me a stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate person. And it's given me a new appreciation for life.\n\nSo yeah. I learned I'm stronger than I thought. And I learned that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. And that's something I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's\u2026 a lot. But I think I'm okay. I think I'm actually going to be okay.", "Ugh, okay. This is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't like an instant, Hallmark movie kind of connection, you know? It evolved. Slowly.\n\nAt first, it was\u2026 awkward. I mean, I was giving them my baby. That's a pretty big thing. There was a lot of politeness, a lot of careful conversation. I felt like I was being interviewed, or something. Like I had to prove I was making the right decision.\n\nBut they were so patient. They didn't push me. They just listened. They asked questions, but they weren't judgmental. They just wanted to get to know me.\n\nAs the process went on, and we started having more regular meetings, I started to feel more comfortable around them. I started to see them as\u2026 people. Not just potential parents.\n\nI learned about their lives, their hopes, their dreams. They told me about their struggles with infertility, and how much they wanted a family. And I started to understand their perspective.\n\nAnd they started to understand mine. They didn't try to minimize my feelings, or tell me it would all be okay. They acknowledged that it was a difficult decision, and they respected my choice.\n\nWe started to talk about things other than the baby. About music, about movies, about our lives. We even laughed a few times.\n\nBy the end of the process, I felt like I had a real connection with them. Not like a mother-father relationship, obviously. But like\u2026 friends. Like people who genuinely cared about me.\n\nIt was still hard, saying goodbye. But knowing that they were going to give my baby a loving and stable home made it a little bit easier.\n\nAnd I still keep in touch with them. They send me updates on the baby, and I send them little gifts. It's not the same as being a mom, but it's\u2026 something.\n\nSo yeah. Our bond changed from awkward politeness to genuine connection. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because I knew that I was making the best decision for my baby. And I knew that he or she was going to be loved. And that's all that really matters. It's still\u2026 a lot to process, but I'm grateful for them. Truly.", "(Pauses, looks down for a moment)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a hard question. And it's one I think about a lot.\n\nDo I have regrets? Yeah. I think everyone has regrets. It's part of being human.\n\nI regret getting into the situation in the first place, obviously. I wish I had been more careful. I wish I had thought things through more.\n\nI regret the stress and worry I put my parents through. They were so supportive, but I know it wasn't easy for them.\n\nI regret losing some of my friendships. Leah and I\u2026 things haven't been the same since. And that hurts.\n\nBut do I regret *choosing* adoption? No. Not really.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. And it was incredibly painful. But I truly believe it was the right decision. For me, and for the baby.\n\nI wasn't ready to be a mother. I wasn't financially stable. I wasn't emotionally prepared. And I knew that I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved.\n\nMark and Vanessa are wonderful people. They're going to be amazing parents. And I know that the baby will be loved and cared for.\n\nSo, yeah. I have regrets. But I don't regret choosing adoption. It was a difficult decision, but it was the right one. And I'm trying to focus on the future, and on creating a good life for myself.\n\nIt's not about erasing the past. It's about learning from it. And about moving forward with hope and courage. It's about accepting that life is messy and imperfect. And about finding peace with the choices you've made.\n\nIt's still\u2026 a lot. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. And I'm trying to be kind to myself along the way. Because everyone deserves a little bit of grace. Especially when they're going through something like this.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It's\u2026 changed everything, honestly. It wasn't just a decision, it was a turning point. Before, I was just\u2026 drifting. Trying to figure out who I was, what I wanted. I was sarcastic and cynical and kinda closed off.\n\nGiving the baby up forced me to grow up, really fast. It forced me to confront my own feelings, to take responsibility for my actions, and to make a difficult decision.\n\nIt taught me a lot about myself. About my strength, my resilience, and my capacity for love. It taught me that it's okay to ask for help, and that it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nIt also taught me the importance of letting go. Of accepting that you can't control everything. And of trusting that things will work out, even when they don't go the way you planned.\n\nIt's made me more empathetic. More understanding. More compassionate. I see the world differently now. I'm more aware of the struggles that other people are facing.\n\nIt's also given me a sense of purpose. I want to use my experience to help others. To advocate for adoption, to support young mothers, and to challenge the stigma surrounding unplanned pregnancies.\n\nIt's still painful, sometimes. I think about the baby a lot. I wonder what he or she is like. I hope they're happy.\n\nBut I know that I made the right decision. I know that I gave the baby the best possible chance at a good life. And that gives me peace.\n\nIt hasn't been easy, but it's made me a stronger, more resilient, and more compassionate person. It's shaped my life in ways I never could have imagined. And I'm grateful for the lessons I've learned. Even the painful ones.\n\nIt's not the life I expected, but it's my life. And I'm determined to make the most of it. It's made me realize that even in the midst of loss and heartbreak, there is still hope. And that even when things fall apart, you can still rebuild. And that's a pretty powerful thing.", "Okay, this is\u2026 important. If there's one thing I've learned through all of this, it's that you're not alone. Even when it feels like you are.\n\nSo, to any young woman who's facing an unplanned pregnancy\u2026 first, breathe. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Those are all normal reactions.\n\nDon't let anyone shame you or judge you. This is *your* body, *your* life, and *your* decision. You have the right to choose what's best for you.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. A parent, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Don't try to go through this alone. You need support.\n\nExplore all your options. Adoption, parenting, abortion\u2026 there are different paths you can take, and you need to find the one that feels right for you.\n\nDon't let anyone pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. This is your life, and you need to make the choice that's best for *you*.\n\nAnd remember, you are strong. You are capable. You are worthy of love and happiness.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. There will be challenges and setbacks. But you can get through this. You can overcome this.\n\nAnd you deserve to have a future filled with hope and joy.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help. Don't be afraid to lean on others. And don't be afraid to be yourself.\n\nYou are not defined by this. You are more than just a pregnant teenager. You are a person with dreams and aspirations and potential.\n\nAnd you deserve to live a life that is full of meaning and purpose.\n\nSo, breathe. Talk. Explore. Choose. And remember, you are not alone. You've got this. Seriously. You do. And if you need someone to talk to, even just a stranger on the internet, I'm here. Okay? Just\u2026 remember that. You're not alone.", "Ugh, okay, this is a story. It wasn't some grand, planned thing. It was\u2026 Bren's idea.\n\nHonestly, I was a mess. I was trying to navigate this whole pregnancy and adoption thing, and I was feeling really isolated. I didn't really have anyone to talk to who understood what I was going through. Leah was\u2026 distant, and my dad and Bren were great, but they couldn't *fully* get it.\n\nBren suggested I start a blog. She said it might be a good way to process my feelings, and to connect with other people who were going through similar experiences.\n\nI was really hesitant at first. I'm not exactly an oversharer. And the thought of putting my life on the internet for everyone to see was terrifying.\n\nBut Bren convinced me to try it. She said it didn't have to be perfect. It didn't have to be polished. It just had to be honest.\n\nSo I started writing. I wrote about my fears, my hopes, my anxieties. I wrote about the challenges of being a pregnant teenager. I wrote about the joys of connecting with Mark and Vanessa.\n\nAnd to my surprise, people started reading it. And they started commenting. And they started sharing their own stories.\n\nIt was amazing. I realized I wasn't alone. There were other people out there who understood what I was going through.\n\nThe blog became a lifeline for me. It gave me a sense of community. It gave me a sense of purpose. It gave me a voice.\n\nIt also helped me to process my emotions. Writing things down made them feel less overwhelming. And getting feedback from others helped me to see things from different perspectives.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I started blogging. It wasn't about seeking attention or fame. It was about finding connection and support. It was about being honest and vulnerable. And it was about helping others to feel less alone. It was\u2026 surprisingly therapeutic. And honestly, it's been one of the best things I've ever done. Even if it's a little bit embarrassing to admit.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breath. That's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know?\n\nBut if I had to pick one biggest lesson\u2026 it's that **you're stronger than you think you are.**\n\nSeriously. I went into this whole thing feeling completely overwhelmed and unprepared. I was scared, confused, and honestly, pretty terrified.\n\nI thought I was going to fall apart. I thought I couldn't handle it.\n\nBut I did.\n\nI made a really difficult decision, and I stood by it. I navigated a lot of complicated emotions. I faced a lot of judgment and criticism.\n\nAnd I came out on the other side\u2026 not unscathed, but stronger. More resilient. More confident.\n\nI learned that I'm capable of more than I ever thought possible. I learned that I can handle anything life throws my way.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nAnd I learned that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the right decisions.\n\nThis experience forced me to grow up, to take responsibility for my actions, and to think about the future. It forced me to confront my own values and to figure out what's really important to me.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was also the most transformative.\n\nSo yeah. The biggest lesson I learned from my pregnancy experience is that you're stronger than you think you are. And that even when things are falling apart, you can still find a way to put yourself back together. It's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. And honestly, it's a pretty good lesson to learn. Even if it took a pregnancy to learn it.", "Okay. This is\u2026 a big one. And it's not something I take lightly. If someone is in my shoes, or even close to it\u2026 listen up.\n\nFirst, **breathe.** Seriously. Just breathe. It feels like the world is ending, I know. But it's not. It's scary, and it's overwhelming, but you *will* get through this.\n\nSecond, **don't make any rash decisions.** You have time. You don't have to figure everything out right away. Take a few days, or a few weeks, to process your feelings and to gather information.\n\nThird, **talk to someone you trust.** A parent, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Someone who will listen without judgment and who will support you no matter what. Don't go through this alone.\n\nFourth, **explore all your options.** There are three main options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. Each one has its own challenges and benefits. You need to weigh them carefully and choose the one that's right for *you*.\n\nFifth, **be honest with yourself.** What do you want? What are you capable of? What are your values? Don't let anyone else tell you what to do. This is your decision, and you need to make it based on what's best for you.\n\nSixth, **remember that you're not alone.** There are other people who have been through this. There are resources available to help you. You don't have to figure everything out on your own.\n\nAnd finally, **be kind to yourself.** This is a difficult situation, and you're doing the best you can. Don't beat yourself up over it. Allow yourself to feel your emotions, and to ask for help when you need it.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. But you are stronger than you think you are. And you will get through this. I promise. And whatever you decide, know that you're not a bad person. You're just a person facing a really tough situation. And you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect.\n\nAnd if you need to talk, even to a random person on the internet pretending to be a teenager from a movie\u2026 I'm here. Seriously. Don't hesitate to reach out. You're not alone.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a lot to think about. It's weird even thinking about this, honestly. But\u2026\n\nIt's not about them being successful in the traditional sense. Not about getting a fancy job or making a lot of money. It's about them being *happy*. Truly, genuinely happy.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, something that makes them excited to get out of bed in the morning. And I want them to have the freedom to pursue that passion, even if it's not what other people expect.\n\nI want them to be kind and compassionate. To treat others with respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. To stand up for what they believe in, even when it's difficult.\n\nI want them to be resilient. To be able to bounce back from setbacks and to learn from their mistakes. To not be afraid to take risks.\n\nI want them to be creative and imaginative. To express themselves in whatever way feels authentic to them. To not be afraid to be different.\n\nAnd most of all, I want them to know that they are loved. Unconditionally. No matter what.\n\nI don't want to impose my own expectations on them. I want them to be their own person. To forge their own path. To live a life that is meaningful and fulfilling to *them*.\n\nI just want them to be good. To be kind. To be happy. And to make the world a little bit better.\n\nIt's not about achieving greatness. It's about living a good life. And that's all I can ask for. For them. And for myself. It's a lot to hope for, I know. But it's worth it. It's everything.", "Ugh, okay. This is important. People have *so* many misconceptions about teen mothers. It's infuriating.\n\nBut the biggest one, the one that really gets under my skin, is the idea that we're all just\u2026 irresponsible and stupid. That we didn't think things through. That we just wanted to have a baby for attention.\n\nThat's just\u2026 not true.\n\nYes, maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we weren't as careful as we should have been. But that doesn't mean we're bad people. It doesn't mean we don't care about our babies.\n\nWe're just kids ourselves. We're still figuring things out. We're still growing up. And we're facing a really difficult situation.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to make a decision like adoption, or to choose to parent when you're not ready. It takes a lot of strength to deal with the judgment and the stigma.\n\nWe're not looking for a handout. We're not looking for sympathy. We just want to be treated with respect.\n\nWe want people to see us as individuals, not as stereotypes. We want people to understand that we're just trying to do the best we can.\n\nAnd we want people to realize that being a teen mother doesn't define us. It's just one part of our story.\n\nSo yeah. The misconception that we're all irresponsible and stupid. That's the one I wish could be corrected. We're not. We're just kids trying to navigate a really complicated world.

And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give him or her that.\n\nI was sixteen. I was still in high school. I didn't have a job. I didn't have a stable home. I wasn't ready to be a mom.\n\nI wanted to finish school. I wanted to pursue my dreams. I wanted to have a future. And I knew that if I kept the baby, those things would be a lot harder to achieve.\n\nIt wasn't a selfish decision. It was a responsible one. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were ready. They were financially stable. They had a loving home. They were desperate to be parents.\n\nThey could give the baby everything I couldn't. A good education, a safe environment, a loving family.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It broke my heart. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a life filled with opportunities. A life filled with love. A life filled with happiness.\n\nAnd I knew that I could give the baby that, even if it meant giving him or her up.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up on the baby. It was about giving the baby a chance. A chance at a better life.\n\nAnd that's what mattered most. It still matters most. It's not a decision I regret. It's a decision I made with love.

The one everyone wants to know about. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't something I took lightly. It wasn't like picking out a pair of shoes.\n\nBren helped a lot. She made me think about what was *really* important. It wasn't about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because there's no such thing. It was about finding the *right* parents for *this* baby.\n\nThere were a few couples we met with. They were all nice people, but something just didn't feel right. Some were too\u2026 eager. Some were too focused on what they wanted. Some just didn't seem to *get* it.\n\nThen we met Vanessa and Mark.\n\nThey weren't flashy or overbearing. They were just\u2026 normal. In a good way. They were kind, and warm, and genuine. They talked about wanting a family, about wanting to give a child a loving home.\n\nBut what really stood out to me was how they talked *about* the baby. They didn't talk about him or her as something they were acquiring. They talked about him or her as a person. A little person who deserved love and respect and a good life.\n\nThey asked me questions about what I wanted for the baby. They wanted to know my hopes and dreams. They wanted to make sure I was comfortable with their plans.\n\nAnd they didn't judge me. They didn't try to tell me what to do. They just listened.\n\nI remember looking at them, and just\u2026 feeling a sense of peace. A sense of trust. A sense of knowing that they would be good parents.\n\nIt wasn't a logical decision. It was a gut feeling. It was like my heart just knew.\n\nIt was still scary, of course. Giving up a baby is never going to be easy. But knowing that he or she was going to be loved and cared for by Vanessa and Mark made it a little bit easier.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I made the decision. It wasn't about finding the perfect parents. It was about finding the right parents. And Vanessa and Mark were the right parents. For this baby. And for me. It was the hardest decision I've ever made, but it was also the right one. And I stand by that.", "Ugh, okay, don't even get me started. Music wasn't just *in* my life during my teenage years, it *was* my life. Seriously. It was my escape, my confidante, my everything.\n\nWhen things were\u2026 complicated, which was pretty much always, I'd just put on my headphones and disappear. It was the only way to block out the noise and the drama and the awkwardness.\n\nI was obsessed with indie music. The Moldy Peaches, Belle & Sebastian, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026 bands that understood what it was like to be a weirdo. Bands that weren't afraid to be honest and vulnerable.\n\nI spent hours browsing record stores, searching for hidden gems. I'd listen to albums over and over again, memorizing every lyric. I'd write my own songs, even though they were terrible.\n\nMusic was a way for me to express myself when I didn't have the words. It was a way to connect with others who felt the same way I did. It was a way to feel less alone.\n\nIt was also a way to rebel. My parents didn't always understand my music taste, which just made me love it even more. It was my way of saying, \"This is me. This is who I am. And I don't care what you think.\"\n\nDuring\u2026 everything, with the pregnancy and the adoption, music was my lifeline. It helped me to process my emotions, to cope with the stress, and to find a little bit of hope.\n\nI'd listen to sad songs when I was feeling sad, and upbeat songs when I needed a pick-me-up. It was like having a soundtrack to my life.\n\nSo yeah. Music played a huge role in my life during my teenage years. It was more than just entertainment. It was a source of comfort, inspiration, and strength. And it still is, to this day. It's the one thing I can always count on. It's just\u2026 important. Really important.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't easy. Not even a little bit. Maplewood isn't exactly known for its progressive thinking, you know?\n\nThere was a lot of whispering. A lot of stares. A lot of judgment. People I'd known for years suddenly acted like they didn't know me. It was\u2026 isolating.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I pretended it didn't bother me. But it did. It really did. It felt like everyone was looking at me like I was some kind of\u2026 mistake.\n\nBren was amazing, though. She told me to hold my head high and not let anyone else define me. She said that people are always going to judge, but that their opinions don't matter as much as my own.\n\nShe also helped me find a support group for pregnant teens. It was\u2026 weird at first. But it was also really helpful to talk to other girls who were going through the same thing. To realize that I wasn't alone.\n\nI also learned to rely on my true friends. Leah, even though things were complicated between us, still showed up for me. And my dad, he was surprisingly supportive. He didn't always understand, but he loved me unconditionally.\n\nI also just\u2026 started to own it. I stopped apologizing for being pregnant. I stopped trying to hide. I just\u2026 was.\n\nIt wasn't about being defiant, it was about self-respect. I wasn't ashamed of my decision. I was making the best choice for everyone involved. And I wasn't going to let anyone else make me feel bad about it.\n\nIt still stung sometimes, though. The judgment, the whispers, the stares. But I learned to tune it out. To focus on the people who loved and supported me. And to remember that I was strong enough to get through it.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I survived. And I came out of it stronger and more resilient. And I learned that sometimes, the most important thing you can do is to be true to yourself, even when the world is telling you to be someone else. It's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 still hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't\u2026 easy. Not at all. People think, \"Oh, you made the decision, so you're okay with it.\" But it's not like flipping a switch. It's a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nGiving birth\u2026 that was intense. And holding him\u2026 she\u2026 it was the most beautiful, terrifying moment of my life. I felt this instant, overwhelming love. And this crushing guilt.\n\nIt was so much harder to say goodbye than I ever imagined. I thought I was prepared, but I wasn't. Seeing Mark and Vanessa holding her\u2026 it was bittersweet. I was happy that she was going to have a loving home, but I was also heartbroken that I wasn't going to be the one to give it to her.\n\nThe first few weeks were\u2026 rough. I cried a lot. I felt empty. I questioned my decision. I wondered if I had made the right choice.\n\nBren was amazing, though. She just let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix things or tell me everything was going to be okay. She just sat with me and listened.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they were so understanding. They sent me pictures and updates, and they let me know that she was happy and healthy. They made me feel like I was still a part of her life, even though I wasn't her mother.\n\nIt took time, but I eventually came to terms with my decision. I realized that I had done the best thing for her. That I had given her a chance at a life that I couldn't provide.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes. I still think about her. I still wonder what she's doing. But I know that she's loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't the life I expected, but it was my life. And I learned a lot from the experience. I learned about love, and loss, and sacrifice. And I learned about the strength of the human spirit.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. But I wouldn't trade it for the world. Because it made me who I am today. And it taught me that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. And that even though things don't always go as planned, they can still turn out okay. They can even turn out\u2026 beautiful. It just looks different than you thought it would.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started. It was\u2026 a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know?\n\nPhysically, it was rough. The morning sickness was brutal. Seriously, I spent a good chunk of the first trimester hugging the toilet. And the fatigue? Forget about it. I could sleep for eighteen hours straight and still feel exhausted.\n\nAnd then there was the body stuff. Like, everything changing. It was weird and uncomfortable and\u2026 just not me. I felt like a stranger in my own skin.\n\nEmotionally, it was even harder. I was scared, confused, and overwhelmed. I was worried about what my parents would think, what my friends would think, what my future would look like.\n\nI cried a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. She was the one who took me to the doctor, who helped me with the morning sickness, who just listened when I needed to vent. She didn't judge me, she just supported me.\n\nMy dad was\u2026 well, he was trying. He didn't really know what to say or do, but he was there for me. He made me pancakes when I couldn't keep anything else down. And he just held me when I was crying.\n\nI also started seeing a therapist. It helped to talk to someone who wasn't involved in the situation. Someone who could offer me unbiased advice and support.\n\nI also found comfort in music. Listening to my favorite songs helped me to calm down and to feel less alone.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever gone through. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI learned that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I learned that I can handle difficult situations. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt was a messy, complicated, and terrifying experience. But it was also a transformative one. And it made me who I am today. And honestly, even though it was awful, I wouldn't trade it for the world. Because it taught me so much about life, about love, and about myself.", "(A long pause. I shift a little, uncomfortable.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a direct question. And it's not an easy one to answer. It's still\u2026 raw.\n\nI didn't *have* an abortion. I considered it. Seriously considered it. And that process, even just thinking about it, changed everything.\n\nBefore, I hadn't really thought much about reproductive rights. It was just\u2026 something that was there. Something I took for granted.\n\nBut going through that, talking to counselors, weighing my options\u2026 it made me realize how incredibly complex it is. How there are no easy answers. And how incredibly important it is for everyone to have access to all the information and all the options.\n\nI realized that judging someone for their choice, whatever that choice may be, is just\u2026 wrong. It's not our place to tell someone what to do with their body. It's not our place to impose our beliefs on them.\n\nI ultimately decided to carry the baby and choose adoption, and that was the right decision *for me*. But I know that abortion is the right decision for a lot of people. And I support their right to choose, without shame or judgment.\n\nIt's about bodily autonomy. It's about freedom. It's about empowering people to make the best decisions for their own lives.\n\nMy experience made me a fierce advocate for reproductive rights. I believe that everyone deserves access to safe, legal, and affordable reproductive healthcare. And I believe that we need to fight to protect those rights.\n\nIt's not about being \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It's about being pro-choice *and* pro-support. It's about supporting people, no matter what decision they make.\n\nIt's a really personal issue, and it's not something to be taken lightly. But it's something that we need to talk about. And it's something that we need to protect. Because everyone deserves the right to control their own body and their own future.\n\n(Another pause. I look down at my hands.)\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. But that's my view. And it's something I feel very strongly about.", "Ugh, \"young parent.\" Sounds so\u2026 official. It was just terrifying, okay? Like, full-blown panic attacks on a regular basis. I wasn't ready for this. Nobody my age is.\n\nBut I didn't really \"overcome\" my fears, not entirely. I just\u2026 learned to live with them. And to push through them.\n\nThe first thing I did was admit I was scared. That sounds simple, but it was huge. I wasn't trying to be brave or strong or pretend everything was okay. I just said, \"I'm terrified.\" And Bren didn't judge me. She just held me.\n\nThen, I started talking to people. Not just Bren, but also Mark and Vanessa, the couple adopting the baby. They were so supportive and understanding. They answered all my questions, and they reassured me that I was doing the right thing.\n\nI also realized I wasn't alone. There were other young women who had faced similar challenges. And I found comfort in knowing that I wasn't the only one.\n\nI also focused on what I *could* control. I couldn't control the fact that I was pregnant. I couldn't control the fact that I was giving the baby up for adoption. But I could control how I handled the situation. I could choose to be responsible. I could choose to be honest. I could choose to be kind.\n\nAnd I learned to trust my instincts. I knew, deep down, that giving the baby up for adoption was the best decision for everyone involved. And that gave me the strength to keep going.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I wanted to just curl up in a ball and cry. But I kept reminding myself that I wasn't alone. And that I was doing the right thing.\n\nSo, I didn't overcome my fears. I just learned to carry them with me. And to keep moving forward, even when I was scared. It wasn't about being fearless, it was about being brave enough to face my fears. And that's something I'm still learning to do, every single day. It's messy, and it's hard, but it's worth it. Because at the end of the day, I know I'm doing the best I can. And that's all anyone can ask for.", "Okay, you're circling back to *that*. It's still\u2026 a lot to unpack, honestly. But I'll try to explain it.\n\nIt wasn't a quick decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and said, \"Yep, adoption is the way to go.\" It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, a lot of talking to Bren and my dad.\n\nThe biggest thing was\u2026 I just wasn't ready to be a mom. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still in high school. I have dreams and goals that I want to pursue. And I knew that if I kept the baby, I wouldn't be able to do those things. Not right now, anyway.\n\nAnd it wasn't fair to the baby, either. Every kid deserves a mom and a dad who are fully prepared and able to provide for them. A stable home, financial security, emotional support\u2026 I couldn't offer that. Not yet.\n\nI thought about abortion, and that didn't feel right to me. I know people have different opinions about that, and that's okay. But for me, it just wasn't an option.\n\nSo adoption felt like the best of both worlds. It allowed me to give the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were ready and willing to love and care for them. And it allowed me to continue pursuing my own dreams.\n\nMeeting Mark and Vanessa sealed the deal. They were just\u2026 good people. They were kind and compassionate and excited about the prospect of becoming parents. They made me feel like my baby would be safe and loved.\n\nIt was still a really hard decision. It was heartbreaking. But I knew it was the right one. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly, it took a lot of courage to admit that to myself. To let go. But I did it. And I don't regret it. It's still sad, but I know I made the right choice. It's about giving that little person the best possible start in life, even if it means I'm not the one giving it to them. It's\u2026 complicated. But it's right.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started. This is\u2026 complicated. Like, really complicated.\n\nWith Leah\u2026 it's just\u2026 sad. We used to be inseparable. We told each other everything. We were partners in crime. But then I got pregnant, and everything changed.\n\nShe didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she was busy, that she had her own life. But I think she was just scared. Scared of what people would think, scared of being associated with me.\n\nI tried to fix it. I tried to talk to her, to explain how I was feeling. But she just wasn't willing to listen. She was too caught up in her own world.\n\nAnd now\u2026 we barely talk. It's like there's this huge wall between us. It hurts, you know? Losing a best friend is like losing a part of yourself.\n\nI still care about her, but I've accepted that our friendship might never be the same. It's a painful realization, but it's one I have to live with.\n\nAnd then there's Paulie. Oh, Paulie. He's\u2026 a character. He's sweet, and he's funny, and he's genuinely a good guy. But he's also\u2026 immature. And irresponsible.\n\nHe was really supportive when I first told him I was pregnant, but he wasn't exactly eager to step up and take responsibility. He wanted me to get an abortion, and when I refused, he kind of just\u2026 checked out.\n\nHe's trying now, I guess. He comes to the doctor's appointments with me, and he's been helping me prepare for the adoption. But it doesn't feel like he's fully invested. It feels like he's just going through the motions.\n\nI don't hate him. I actually have a soft spot for him. But I don't think we're meant to be together. We're just too different.\n\nI think we both need to move on and find someone who's better suited for us. Someone who's ready to commit and to take responsibility.\n\nSo yeah. My relationships are\u2026 messy. They're complicated. They're a work in progress. And honestly, I'm just trying to navigate them the best I can. It's not easy, but I'm learning a lot about myself and about what I want in a relationship. And that's something, right? It has to be.", "(Sighs, a long, drawn-out sigh) Okay. Here we go. This is\u2026 not a fun question. And it's not like I *decided* to become a teenage mother. It just\u2026 happened.\n\nIt wasn't a conscious choice. It wasn't something I planned or wanted. It was a mistake. A really big mistake.\n\nPaulie Bleeker and I\u2026 we were just kids. We weren't thinking about the consequences. We were just\u2026 being kids. And we weren't careful.\n\nI know it sounds irresponsible. And it is. But we were young and stupid and we didn't know any better.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting a baby. It wasn't about wanting to be a mother. It was about a moment of\u2026 carelessness. A moment of bad judgment.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I was pregnant. And my life was completely turned upside down.\n\nIt was terrifying. I was scared and confused and I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over.\n\nBut then I started to think about my options. And I realized that I wasn't ready to be a mother. I wasn't ready to give up my dreams.\n\nSo I made the difficult decision to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision. But it was the right decision. For me. And for the baby.\n\nSo, to answer your question, I didn't *decide* to become a teenage mother. It just happened. And it was a mistake that changed my life forever. But it also taught me a lot about myself. And about the importance of responsibility. And about the power of choice.\n\nIt's not a story I like to tell. But it's my story. And it's a part of who I am. And I'm trying to learn from it. And to move forward. Even though it's hard. Really hard.", "(A long pause. I look down, scuffing my shoe against\u2026 well, whatever imaginary floor we're on.)\n\nThat's\u2026 a really hard question. And it's one I ask myself a lot.\n\nThere were definitely moments. Especially in the beginning. When I was really sick, and really scared, and really lonely. Moments where I wondered if I'd made the wrong decision. Moments where I wished things could have been different.\n\nAnd there's still a part of me that feels a little bit sad. A little bit empty. A little bit like I'm missing something.\n\nBut\u2026 no. I don't regret my decision. Not really.\n\nBecause I know that I made the best decision I could, given the circumstances. I knew I wasn't ready to be a mother. I knew I couldn't give the baby the life it deserved.\n\nAnd I know that Mark and Vanessa are amazing parents. They love the baby so much. They give him or her everything. And that makes me feel\u2026 good.\n\nIt doesn't erase the sadness, but it makes it bearable.\n\nI think if I had kept the baby, I would have been miserable. And the baby would have been miserable too.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret my decision. It was a hard decision, but it was the right decision. And I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to find happiness in other things.\n\nIt's not a perfect story. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's my story. And I'm proud of myself for making the best of it.\n\n(I look up, a small, sad smile on my face.)\n\nIt's just\u2026 sometimes it still hurts. But I'm okay. I'm getting there. And that's all that matters, right?", "Ugh, don't even *ask*. It was\u2026 a struggle. A monumental, sleep-deprived, emotionally exhausting struggle.\n\nHonestly, I almost didn't. There were days I just wanted to give up. I was tired all the time, and school felt pointless. And dealing with the judgment from some people\u2026 that was rough.\n\nBut Bren was a lifesaver. She really pushed me to stay focused. She helped me with my homework, she drove me to school, and she just\u2026 believed in me. Even when I didn't believe in myself.\n\nMr. Harrison, my English teacher, was also really supportive. He let me take extra time on assignments, and he always checked in to see how I was doing. He didn't treat me like a charity case, he just treated me like a student who was going through a tough time.\n\nI also had a few friends who were really understanding. Leah, eventually, came around. And a couple of other kids in my class offered their support.\n\nI had to make a lot of sacrifices. I had to give up some of my hobbies, and I had to say no to a lot of social events. I spent a lot of nights studying instead of hanging out with my friends.\n\nAnd I relied heavily on caffeine. Like, a *lot* of caffeine.\n\nBut I did it. I graduated. It wasn't easy, but I did it. And I'm really proud of myself.\n\nIt taught me a lot about resilience, and about the importance of having a support system. And it taught me that even when things are really hard, you can still achieve your goals.\n\nSo yeah. I finished high school while pregnant. It wasn't glamorous, it wasn't easy, but it was worth it. And it's something I'll always be proud of. Now, please don't make me relive it. It was stressful enough the first time.", "Okay, this is\u2026 the big question, isn't it? The one everyone wants to know. It's not a simple answer, and it took me a long time to figure it out.\n\nIt wasn't about what anyone else thought. It wasn't about religion, or politics, or anything like that. It was about\u2026 what felt right.\n\nI thought about abortion, I really did. And it wasn't an easy thought to dismiss. It felt\u2026 practical, in a way. Like it would solve all my problems.\n\nBut the more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt. It just didn't sit right with me. It felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nI know that sounds vague, and maybe even a little silly. But it's the truth. It was a gut feeling.\n\nI also thought about the baby. About the potential life inside me. And I realized that I couldn't just\u2026 end it. Even though I wasn't ready to be a mom, I still felt a connection to that little person.\n\nAdoption felt like a way to give the baby a chance at a good life. A life with parents who were ready and willing to love and care for them.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision. It was heartbreaking, actually. But it felt like the right thing to do.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a family. I wanted the baby to be wanted. And I knew that I couldn't provide that, not right now.\n\nSo I chose adoption. And it was the hardest decision I've ever made. But it was also the most selfless. And I think, in the end, it was the right one.\n\nIt wasn't about what was easy. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's all that really mattered. It still matters. It's not something I talk about a lot, because it's still painful. But it's a decision I stand by. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand.", "Okay, this is a serious question. And honestly, it's something I've been thinking about *a lot* lately.\n\nAbsolutely. One hundred percent. A child can absolutely thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements.\n\nLove is what matters. Not gender, not marital status, not anything else. Love, and stability, and a commitment to providing a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nMark and Vanessa, the couple who are adopting my baby, they're\u2026 amazing. They're kind, they're loving, and they're incredibly excited to become parents. They're going to give that baby a wonderful life. And the fact that they're a couple doesn't change that.\n\nI've seen single parents raise happy, well-adjusted kids. I've seen same-sex couples create loving and supportive families. It's not about the *structure* of the family, it's about the *quality* of the relationships within it.\n\nAnyone who says otherwise is just\u2026 stuck in the past. They're clinging to outdated ideas about what a family should look like.\n\nA child needs love, support, and guidance. They need someone to believe in them, to encourage them, and to help them reach their full potential. And that can come from anyone, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation or marital status.\n\nHonestly, I think kids who are raised in non-traditional families are often more resilient and more open-minded. They learn to appreciate diversity and to challenge societal norms.\n\nSo yeah. I firmly believe that a child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. It's not about fitting into a mold, it's about creating a loving and supportive environment where a child can grow and flourish. And that's what really matters. It's the only thing that really matters.", "Ugh. Don't make me do this. It's bad enough admitting things to myself, let alone to a\u2026 well, to whatever *you* are.\n\nOkay, fine. If I have to be honest\u2026 my biggest flaw is probably my **sarcasm.**\n\nI know, it sounds ridiculous. It's like, my whole *thing* is being sarcastic. But it's also a defense mechanism. I use it to keep people at arm's length. To avoid getting hurt. To deflect from my own vulnerability.\n\nIt's a habit, and it's hard to break. And sometimes, it comes across as mean or dismissive, even when I don't mean it to.\n\nI've definitely hurt people with my sarcasm. And I've definitely pushed people away.\n\nBren has pointed it out to me a few times. She says I need to learn to be more open and honest with my feelings, instead of hiding behind a wall of irony.\n\nAnd she's right. I know she's right.\n\nIt's just\u2026 it's hard. It's easier to be sarcastic than to be vulnerable. It's easier to make a joke than to admit that you're scared or sad.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm trying to be more mindful of my words. I'm trying to be more empathetic. And I'm trying to let people see the real me, even if it's messy and imperfect.\n\nIt's a work in progress. But I'm determined to overcome this flaw. Because I want to be a better friend, a better daughter, and a better person. And I know that I can't do that if I'm always hiding behind a wall of sarcasm.\n\nSo yeah. Sarcasm. It's my biggest flaw. And it's something I'm trying to fix. Don't hold your breath, though. It's not going to happen overnight. I'm still me, after all. And a little bit of sarcasm is just part of who I am. But I'm trying to use it more responsibly. Okay? Is that good enough?", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026 complicated. It wasn't a *relationship* relationship, you know? It was different. But it definitely changed how I look at things.\n\nBefore meeting Mark and Vanessa, I kinda thought all relationships were about drama and messiness and\u2026 disappointment. My mom wasn't around, Leah and I were going through stuff, I hadn't really had a good romantic relationship yet. So I figured that was just how it was.\n\nBut Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they showed me a different side of things. They were so kind and supportive and understanding. They didn't judge me. They didn't try to control me. They just\u2026 accepted me for who I was.\n\nThey were genuinely excited about becoming parents, and they were so grateful for the opportunity. And they treated me with respect, even though I was just a teenager who was giving them their baby.\n\nIt made me realize that relationships don't have to be about power dynamics or manipulation or drama. They can be about mutual respect, trust, and compassion.\n\nIt also made me realize that love comes in many different forms. It's not just romantic love. It's also the love between friends, the love between family members, and the love between people who are willing to open their hearts to each other.\n\nSeeing how Mark and Vanessa interacted with each other, how they supported each other, how they communicated with each other\u2026 it gave me hope. It made me believe that it's possible to have a healthy, fulfilling relationship.\n\nIt didn't magically fix all my problems, or make me suddenly an expert on relationships. But it did change my perspective. It made me realize that I deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. And it made me believe that I'm capable of giving that in return.\n\nSo yeah. Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they showed me what a good relationship looks like. And it's something I'll carry with me, no matter what happens in the future. It was a really important lesson, and I'm grateful for it. Even if it came with a lot of complicated feelings.", "Okay, look. This is\u2026 hard to talk about. But if someone is going through what I went through, I want them to know they're not alone. And I want them to know it's okay to feel all the things.\n\nFirst, **don't be afraid to ask for help.** Seriously. Talk to your parents, your friends, a counselor, anyone you trust. You don't have to go through this by yourself.\n\nSecond, **take your time.** Don't let anyone pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. This is *your* life, and *your* body. You have the right to choose what's best for you.\n\nThird, **explore all your options.** Adoption, parenting, abortion\u2026 they're all valid choices. And it's important to understand what each one entails before you make a decision.\n\nFourth, **be kind to yourself.** This is a really difficult situation, and you're going to be feeling a lot of emotions. It's okay to be scared, to be sad, to be confused. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nFifth, **remember that you are strong.** You are capable of getting through this. Even when it feels like you can't.\n\nAnd sixth, **trust your gut.** If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Listen to your intuition and make a decision that feels right for you.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. There will be challenges and setbacks. But you can get through this. And you deserve to be happy.\n\nAnd remember, whatever you decide, it doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you a human being. A human being who is trying to do the best they can in a difficult situation.\n\nSo yeah. Ask for help, take your time, explore your options, be kind to yourself, remember your strength, and trust your gut. That's my advice. And I hope it helps. Because honestly, you deserve all the support in the world. You really do.", "Ugh, that's\u2026 complicated. It's not like a movie montage where everything magically clicks into place. It's been a slow burn, a lot of awkward silences, and a lot of learning to understand each other.\n\nWhen I was little, my dad was just\u2026 Dad. He was the provider, the fixer, the one who took me to the park. He wasn't really good at the emotional stuff. He's a pretty quiet guy, you know? He shows his love through actions, not words.\n\nAs I got older, and especially as I became a teenager, our relationship got strained. I started to pull away, and he didn't really know how to reach me. We argued a lot. About school, about my friends, about everything.\n\nThen, when I got pregnant\u2026 that was a turning point. He was shocked, obviously. But he didn't yell or get angry. He just\u2026 looked sad. And then he told me he loved me, and that he would support me no matter what.\n\nThat meant a lot. It meant everything, actually.\n\nSince then, our relationship has gotten a lot better. We still don't talk about everything, but we're more open with each other. He's learned to listen more, and I've learned to be more patient.\n\nHe's been incredibly supportive throughout this whole adoption process. He's gone with me to appointments, he's helped me with the paperwork, and he's just been there for me, emotionally.\n\nI think he's realized that I'm not a little girl anymore. I'm a young woman, and I'm capable of making my own decisions. And he's started to treat me with more respect.\n\nI've also realized that he's not perfect. He's made mistakes. But he's a good man. And he loves me, in his own way.\n\nOur relationship is still evolving, but it's getting stronger every day. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. He's my dad. And I love him. Even when he's being annoying. Especially when he's being annoying. It's just\u2026 our thing. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me sound like some kind of literary genius. I'm not. I just\u2026 write stuff.\n\nBut alright, if you want to know how I got into it\u2026 it started with journaling, actually. When I was younger, I was a really angsty kid. Shocking, I know. And I needed a way to get my feelings out. So I started writing in a journal.\n\nAt first, it was just a bunch of random thoughts and complaints. But over time, it started to evolve into something more. I started experimenting with different writing styles, and I started trying to express myself in more creative ways.\n\nThen, in eighth grade, I took a creative writing class. And that's where I really started to develop my skills. My teacher, Mr. Peterson, was amazing. He encouraged us to take risks, to experiment with different forms, and to find our own voices.\n\nHe introduced me to a lot of different writers, like Sylvia Plath and Kurt Vonnegut and Margaret Atwood. And he taught me how to use language in a more effective way.\n\nI also read a lot. I've always been a voracious reader. And I think that reading has had a huge impact on my writing. It's exposed me to different styles and techniques, and it's inspired me to try new things.\n\nAnd honestly, a lot of it is just practice. The more you write, the better you get. It's like any other skill.\n\nI also get a lot of inspiration from music. I listen to a lot of indie rock and folk music, and the lyrics often spark ideas for my own writing.\n\nSo yeah. Journaling, creative writing class, reading, practice, and music. That's how I developed my creative writing skills. It's not a glamorous process, but it's rewarding. And it's a way for me to express myself and to make sense of the world. And honestly, it's a pretty good way to spend my time. It's better than, like, watching reality TV, anyway. Though, don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 not a fun topic. But it's real. The judgment. The stares. The whispers. It was awful. Honestly, it still is, sometimes.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I pretended it didn't bother me. But it did. It really did. It felt like everyone was looking at me, judging me, condemning me.\n\nI got a lot of side-eye at school. Some people were outright mean. And even people who were trying to be nice sometimes said things that were hurtful. Like, \"Oh, honey, what happened?\" or \"You're so young.\"\n\nIt made me want to disappear. To just crawl into a hole and never come out.\n\nBut then Bren helped me realize that their judgment said more about *them* than it did about *me*. She said that people are often afraid of what they don't understand. And that they project their own insecurities onto others.\n\nShe also reminded me that I wasn't alone. That there were other pregnant teenagers out there. And that I deserved to be treated with respect, regardless of my situation.\n\nSo I started to stand up for myself. I started to challenge the negative stereotypes. I started to talk openly about my experience.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It took a lot of courage. But it was empowering.\n\nI also found support in unexpected places. Some of my friends were incredibly supportive. And even some of the teachers at school were really understanding.\n\nAnd I learned to focus on the people who loved and supported me, and to ignore the haters.\n\nIt's still a work in progress. I still get judged sometimes. But I'm learning to be more resilient. I'm learning to not let other people's opinions define me.\n\nI'm learning to be proud of who I am, and to own my story.\n\nIt's not easy being a pregnant teenager. But it's not something to be ashamed of. It's a part of my life. And I'm going to face it with courage and grace. And I'm going to show the world that I'm more than just a statistic. I'm a person. And I deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I dealt with the stigma and judgment. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Because I learned that my worth isn't determined by other people's opinions. It's determined by who I am. And I'm pretty okay with who I am. Even with all the messiness.", "Ugh, okay, that's a loaded question. Do I regret being outspoken and honest? Sometimes. Definitely sometimes.\n\nIt's gotten me into trouble more times than I can count. It's burned bridges. It's made people angry. It's made things awkward.\n\nThere have been times when I've wished I'd just kept my mouth shut. When I'd wished I'd just gone along with the crowd. When I'd wished I hadn't said what I was thinking.\n\nBut then I think about it, and I realize that I wouldn't be me if I wasn't outspoken and honest. It's just who I am. It's part of my personality.\n\nAnd honestly, I'd rather be disliked for being myself than liked for being someone I'm not.\n\nIt's not always easy, though. It takes courage to speak your mind, especially when you know it's going to be unpopular. And it takes a lot of self-confidence to stand up for what you believe in.\n\nBut I think it's important. I think it's important to be authentic. I think it's important to be true to yourself.\n\nAnd I think it's important to challenge the status quo. To question authority. To speak truth to power.\n\nSo yeah, I regret it sometimes. But mostly, I'm proud of being outspoken and honest. It's what makes me, me. And I wouldn't trade that for anything. Even if it means getting into trouble every now and then. It's just\u2026 who I am. And I'm learning to accept that. And maybe, just maybe, the world needs a few more people who aren't afraid to speak their minds. Even if it's a little bit messy.", "Ugh. Okay, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it? It's something I've been wrestling with *a lot* lately.\n\nHonestly? It's not easy. It's a constant battle. People are always going to have opinions, especially about someone like me, making the choices I'm making. And it's tempting to just give in, to try to please everyone, to be what they want you to be.\n\nBut I've learned that you can't. You just can't. Because if you try to be everything to everyone, you end up losing yourself.\n\nSo, how do I navigate it? It's a few things.\n\nFirst, I remind myself of my values. What's important to *me*? Honesty, independence, compassion. Those are my guiding principles. And if a decision aligns with those values, then I know I'm on the right track, even if other people disagree.\n\nSecond, I surround myself with people who support me. Bren, my dad, even Leah, when she's being supportive. People who love me for who I am, flaws and all. Their opinions matter to me, because they genuinely care about my well-being.\n\nThird, I learn to tune out the noise. The judgment, the criticism, the negativity. It's easier said than done, but I try to focus on what *I* think and feel, rather than what other people think and feel.\n\nAnd fourth, I remind myself that I'm not perfect. I'm going to make mistakes. I'm going to stumble and fall. But that's okay. It's part of being human.\n\nIt's about finding that balance between listening to advice and trusting your own instincts. It's about being open to feedback, but not letting it define you.\n\nIt's about remembering that you are the only one who can truly know what's best for you.\n\nIt's a work in progress, honestly. I still struggle with it sometimes. But I'm getting better at it. And I'm learning to be more confident in my own decisions.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, the only person I have to answer to is myself. And I want to be able to look myself in the mirror and say, \"I did the best I could. And I stayed true to who I am.\" And that's all that really matters.", "Okay, you're asking the big questions now, huh? It's not like I've had a lot of time to sit around and philosophize, but I've definitely thought about this stuff. Especially lately.\n\nIf I had to pick a few values that are most important to me\u2026 it would be **honesty, independence, and compassion.**\n\n**Honesty** is huge. I need to be able to trust people, and I need to be able to be myself. I don't want to pretend to be someone I'm not, and I don't want to surround myself with people who aren't genuine. It's about being real, even when it's hard.\n\n**Independence** is also really important. I want to be able to make my own decisions, and to live my life on my own terms. I don't want to be controlled by anyone. I want to be free to be me. It's about being self-reliant and not needing anyone to tell me what to do.\n\nAnd **compassion**\u2026 I think it's important to be kind to others. To try to understand their perspectives. To offer a helping hand when they need it. It's about recognizing that we're all in this together, and that we all deserve to be treated with respect.\n\nThose values aren't always easy to live by. Sometimes, it's easier to lie, or to conform, or to be selfish. But I try. I really do.\n\nI think those values are what make me\u2026 me. And they're what guide my decisions. They're what help me to navigate the world.\n\nAnd they're what I hope to pass on to others. Because I think if everyone lived by those values, the world would be a much better place. It's a simple idea, but it's a powerful one. And it's something I believe in. Deeply.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. There were a lot of challenges. But I think the biggest one wasn't the physical stuff, like the morning sickness or the exhaustion. It was the **loneliness.**\n\nEveryone was supportive, don't get me wrong. Bren was amazing, my dad tried his best, and even some of my friends were understanding. But there was still this feeling of being\u2026 alone.\n\nLike, no one could truly understand what I was going through. No one could understand the fear, the uncertainty, the guilt.\n\nLeah\u2026 well, Leah kind of drifted away. She didn't know how to handle it, and I didn't blame her. But it still hurt. It felt like I was losing my best friend at the worst possible time.\n\nAnd then there was the judgment. The whispers, the stares, the assumptions. It felt like everyone was looking at me differently. Like I was some kind of outcast.\n\nIt was hard to feel like a normal teenager when I was carrying a baby. It was hard to go to school, to hang out with my friends, to just\u2026 live my life.\n\nI felt like I was carrying this huge secret, and I was afraid to share it with anyone. I was afraid of being judged, of being rejected, of being alone.\n\nSo I kind of shut down. I withdrew from my friends, I stopped doing the things I loved, and I just tried to get through each day.\n\nIt was a really dark time. And it was the loneliness that made it so hard. It was the feeling of being isolated and alone in the world.\n\nIt took a lot of courage to reach out for help. To talk to Bren, to talk to Mark and Vanessa, to talk to a counselor. But it was the best thing I ever did.\n\nBecause I realized that I wasn't alone. There were people who cared about me, who supported me, and who wanted to help.\n\nAnd that made all the difference. It helped me to get through the toughest times. And it helped me to realize that even in the darkest of moments, there is always hope. But yeah\u2026 the loneliness. That was the hardest part. Definitely.", "(A long pause. This one\u2026 this one hits different.)\n\nOkay. Wow. That's\u2026 a big question. Even though I *am* giving the baby up for adoption, just knowing I carried him, knowing I created a life\u2026 it's changed everything.\n\nBefore, I was so focused on myself. On my own problems, my own dreams, my own future. I was cynical and sarcastic and I didn't really care about much beyond getting through the day.\n\nBut being pregnant\u2026 it forced me to grow up. It forced me to think about someone other than myself. It forced me to take responsibility for my actions.\n\nAnd it made me realize that life is precious. That it's a gift. And that it's not something to be taken for granted.\n\nIt's also made me more empathetic. I feel more connected to other people. I understand that everyone is fighting their own battles. And I want to be a source of support and kindness for those around me.\n\nIt's made me realize that even though I'm not raising this baby, I'm still a part of his or her life. And that's a really powerful feeling.\n\nIt's also made me appreciate my own mom, even the one who isn't around much. I understand now how hard it is to be a mother. And I have a newfound respect for all the mothers out there.\n\nIt's\u2026 complicated. It's bittersweet. It's heartbreaking. But it's also beautiful.\n\nIt's made me realize that even in the midst of loss and sadness, there is still hope. And that even though life doesn't always go according to plan, it can still be good.\n\nSo yeah. Being a mother, even in this unconventional way, has changed my perspective on life. It's made me a stronger, more compassionate, and more grateful person. And it's something I'll never forget. It's\u2026 it's everything, really. It's changed everything.", "Ugh. Self-doubt. My constant companion. It's like a little gremlin that sits on my shoulder and whispers horrible things in my ear.\n\nHonestly? It's *really* hard. I'm good at being sarcastic and independent, but underneath all that, I'm just\u2026 insecure.\n\nWhen I start to doubt myself, I usually try to distract myself. I'll listen to music, or watch a movie, or hang out with Bren. Anything to get my mind off things.\n\nBut that doesn't always work. Sometimes, the self-doubt just keeps creeping back in.\n\nSo then I try to talk to someone about it. Bren is really good at listening. She doesn't try to fix things, she just lets me vent. And she reminds me of my strengths.\n\nI also try to remind myself of all the things I've accomplished. It's easy to focus on your failures, but it's important to remember your successes too.\n\nAnd I try to be kind to myself. I tell myself that it's okay to make mistakes. It's okay to not be perfect. And it's okay to feel scared and uncertain.\n\nIt's a process. It's not something that happens overnight. But I'm learning to be more compassionate towards myself.\n\nI also have a little mantra that I repeat to myself when I'm feeling particularly doubtful. It's just a simple phrase: \"You are enough.\"\n\nIt sounds cheesy, I know. But it helps. It reminds me that I'm worthy of love and respect, even when I'm feeling lost and confused.\n\nSo yeah. Distraction, talking to someone, remembering my accomplishments, being kind to myself, and repeating my mantra. That's how I deal with moments of self-doubt. It's not always easy, but it's worth it. Because you deserve to believe in yourself. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.", "Ugh, okay, don't get all sentimental on me. But seriously? It's\u2026 everything. It's *huge*.\n\nI used to think I was totally independent. Like, I didn't need anyone. I could handle everything on my own. Which is, like, a classic teenage delusion.\n\nBut this whole situation\u2026 the pregnancy, the adoption\u2026 it's shown me just how much I need other people.\n\nI wouldn't have gotten through it without Bren. She's been my rock. She's listened to me, she's supported me, she's helped me make decisions. She's just\u2026 been there.\n\nAnd even though things are complicated with Leah right now, I miss her. I miss having someone to talk to, someone to laugh with, someone to just\u2026 be with.\n\nAnd even my dad, who's not exactly the most emotionally expressive guy, has been really supportive. He's been trying to understand, and he's been doing his best to be there for me.\n\nI've also realized how important it is to have a community. To be surrounded by people who care about you, who believe in you, and who will support you no matter what.\n\nIt's not about needing to be rescued. It's about having people to share your joys and your sorrows with. It's about having people to lean on when you're feeling down. It's about having people to celebrate with when you're feeling up.\n\nIt's about knowing that you're not alone.\n\nI think a lot of people underestimate the importance of community. They think they can go it alone. But they can't. We all need each other.\n\nSo yeah. Community and social support are incredibly important to me. They're essential. They're what get me through the day. And I'm incredibly grateful for the people in my life who support me. They're the ones who make me feel like I can handle anything. And honestly, without them, I don't know where I'd be.", "Ugh. Okay, deep breath. That's\u2026 a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know?\n\nBut if I had to pick one lesson\u2026 the most important thing I learned through all of this was that **you are stronger than you think you are.**\n\nSeriously. I went into this feeling completely overwhelmed and terrified. I didn't know how I was going to cope. I didn't know how I was going to make it through.\n\nBut I did.\n\nI faced a lot of difficult decisions. I had to deal with a lot of judgment. I had to be brave and honest and vulnerable.\n\nAnd I realized that I was capable of more than I ever thought possible.\n\nI learned that I could handle anything life threw at me. I learned that I could rely on myself. And I learned that I could find strength in the face of adversity.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears and a lot of sleepless nights. But I got through it. And I came out on the other side a stronger, more resilient person.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to lean on others. It's okay to not be perfect.\n\nThis whole experience forced me to grow up faster than I was ready to. But it also taught me a lot about myself. And it taught me a lot about life.\n\nSo yeah. You are stronger than you think you are. That's the most important lesson I learned. And it's a lesson I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. It's a lesson that I hope everyone learns. Because everyone deserves to know that they're capable of amazing things. Even when they don't believe it themselves.", "Ugh, that's a loaded question. Honestly, I haven't really thought that far ahead. I'm still trying to figure out what I want for dinner, let alone a career.\n\nBut\u2026 maybe.\n\nI've always loved writing. It's a way for me to express myself, to make sense of the world, and to connect with others. I love the way words can be used to create images, to evoke emotions, and to tell stories.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm good enough to make a career out of it, though. It's a competitive field, and I'm not exactly known for my confidence.\n\nBut I've been getting a lot of encouragement from my English teacher, Mr. Harrison. He says I have a unique voice and a talent for storytelling. And Bren thinks I should pursue my passions.\n\nSo, I'm considering it. Maybe I'll take some writing classes in college. Maybe I'll try to get my work published. Maybe I'll just keep writing for myself, as a way to stay sane.\n\nI don't know. It's scary to think about making a career out of something you love. What if you fail? What if you're not good enough?\n\nBut I think it's worth a try. I think it's important to pursue your passions, even if they're a little bit scary.\n\nSo yeah. Maybe. I might pursue a career in writing. It's not a definite plan, but it's something I'm considering. And who knows? Maybe someday you'll be reading a novel written by Juno MacGuff. Don't laugh. It could happen. It's a long shot, but\u2026 maybe.", "Ugh, okay, this is a sensitive topic. It took *forever*. And it involved a lot of back and forth with Mark and Vanessa. It wasn't like I got to just pick whatever I wanted, you know? It had to be something everyone agreed on.\n\nI had a whole list of names I liked. Mostly indie musician names, like Joni or Billie. But Vanessa wanted something more traditional. And Mark just wanted something that sounded good.\n\nWe went back and forth for weeks. It was exhausting.\n\nThen, one day, Vanessa mentioned her grandmother's name. Her grandmother's name was **Hazel.**\n\nAnd it just\u2026 clicked.\n\nIt's a classic name, but it's not *too* classic. It's a little bit quirky, a little bit vintage. And it just felt right.\n\nIt reminded me of hazel eyes, and hazelnut coffee, and warm autumn days. It felt\u2026 gentle.\n\nMark liked it too. And even I, despite my initial preference for more unconventional names, fell in love with it.\n\nSo, Hazel it was.\n\nIt's a little bit sad, not getting to actually *raise* Hazel. But knowing that she has a loving family, and a beautiful name, makes it a little bit easier.\n\nIt's a good name. A strong name. A hopeful name. And I think it suits her perfectly. Even though I haven't even met her yet.\n\nSo yeah. Hazel. That's the name we chose. And I think it's a perfect name for a perfect little girl. Even if she's not *my* little girl, in the traditional sense. She'll always be special to me. Always.", "Ugh. \"Cope\" is a strong word. It was\u2026 a lot. A *lot* of everything. It wasn't like riding a rollercoaster, it was like being strapped to a rocket that was constantly changing direction.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were the worst. It was a mix of relief, sadness, guilt, and fear. I felt like I was constantly crying. And I couldn't sleep. And I didn't want to talk to anyone.\n\nBren was a lifesaver. She just\u2026 let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix things, or tell me everything was going to be okay. She just sat with me and listened. And she made me tea. A lot of tea.\n\nI also started journaling. It helped to get my thoughts and feelings out of my head and onto paper. It was like talking to a friend, but without having to worry about being judged.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It was hard at first, but it really helped. She gave me tools to cope with my emotions and to process my grief.\n\nI also spent a lot of time with Mark and Vanessa. Getting to know them, talking to them, and seeing how excited they were about the baby. It helped me to feel more comfortable with my decision.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I wanted to just give up. But I kept reminding myself that I was doing this for the baby. That I was giving him or her the best possible life.\n\nAnd I learned to accept that it was okay to be sad. It was okay to grieve. It was okay to feel all the complicated emotions that came with adoption.\n\nIt's still hard sometimes. I still think about the baby. But I'm learning to find peace with my decision. And I'm learning to focus on the future.\n\nIt's not a perfect process. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also beautiful and hopeful. And it's something I'm proud of.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I coped. By allowing myself to feel, by talking to people I trusted, and by reminding myself that I was doing the right thing. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. And I'm stronger for it. I think. Maybe. Still working on that part.", "Okay, finally a question I can really sink my teeth into. You're asking the right person.\n\nI'm not really into mainstream stuff, you know? Like, no Top 40 radio for me. It's all about the indie scene. The stuff that's a little bit weird, a little bit quirky, a little bit\u2026 real.\n\nI'm a huge fan of **The Moldy Peaches**, like I said before. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson are geniuses. Their songs are just so honest and vulnerable.\n\nI also love **Belle & Sebastian**. They're Scottish, and their music is all about storytelling and melancholy. It's perfect for rainy days.\n\n**Neutral Milk Hotel** is another favorite. Their album \"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\" is a masterpiece. It's weird and experimental and totally captivating.\n\nI'm also really into **Bright Eyes** (Conor Oberst is a lyrical genius), **Death Cab for Cutie**, **Spoon**, **Arcade Fire**, and **The Shins**.\n\nI listen to a lot of vinyl, too. There's just something about the sound of a record that's different from digital music. It's warmer and more organic.\n\nAnd I'm always on the lookout for new bands. I love discovering hidden gems.\n\nBasically, if it's indie, it's probably on my playlist. I like music that makes me think, that makes me feel, that makes me want to dance. I like music that's authentic and honest and a little bit different.\n\nSo yeah. That's my musical taste in a nutshell. It's a little bit eclectic, a little bit quirky, and a whole lot of awesome. And if you don't like it, well, that's your problem. Just kidding. Sort of.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? It wasn't a moment of instant connection and happy tears. It was\u2026 more nuanced than that.\n\nTheir house was\u2026 nice. Really nice. Like, way nicer than my house. It was big and airy and decorated in a way that felt\u2026 perfect. Everything was in its place. It was clean. It smelled like vanilla.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa were\u2026 nice. Really nice. They were warm and welcoming, and they tried really hard to make me feel comfortable. They asked me about my interests, about my life, about what I wanted for the baby.\n\nBut it felt\u2026 different. Their lifestyle was different. They had a dog, a golden retriever named Cooper, who was very enthusiastic. They had a garden, and they talked about organic vegetables and farmers markets. They were\u2026 suburban.\n\nMy life is\u2026 not suburban. It's messy and chaotic and a little bit weird. And I was worried that the baby wouldn't fit in. That he or she would feel out of place.\n\nI also felt a little bit\u2026 intimidated. They seemed to have everything figured out. They had a stable home, a good income, and a clear vision for the future. And I was just\u2026 a pregnant teenager with a lot of uncertainty.\n\nBut then, I started to notice the little things. The way Mark looked at Vanessa when she wasn't looking. The way they talked about their hopes and dreams for the baby. The way they made me feel like my feelings mattered.\n\nAnd I realized that it wasn't about the house, or the lifestyle, or the perfect decorations. It was about the love. It was about the fact that they were genuinely excited to become parents. And that they were willing to open their hearts and their home to my baby.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect fit, but it was a good fit. And I knew that they would give the baby a loving and stable home. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nSo yeah. It was a little bit scary, a little bit intimidating, but ultimately\u2026 hopeful. And I knew, deep down, that I was making the right decision. It wasn't about finding a perfect family, it was about finding a loving family. And Mark and Vanessa were definitely that.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on my lips) Okay, so this is a story. A slightly embarrassing story.\n\nIt started with Paulie Moses. You know, the kid who always smells faintly of cheese puffs? He's\u2026 enthusiastic. And he has a drum set. A really loud drum set.\n\nHe kept bugging me to join his band. He said I had \"vibes.\" Which, honestly, is the weirdest compliment I've ever received.\n\nI told him no. Repeatedly. I don't consider myself a musician. I strum a guitar, sure, but I'm not exactly Jimi Hendrix.\n\nBut then Leah\u2026 well, things were weird with Leah at the time. We weren't really talking. And I was feeling\u2026 restless. And Paulie just wouldn't give up.\n\nHe said we needed a bass player. And he said he had a bass. And he said it was \"vintage.\" Which, knowing Paulie, probably meant it was covered in dust and smelled like his grandma's attic.\n\nBut I figured, what did I have to lose? It was something to do. A distraction. A way to get out of the house.\n\nSo I agreed. And it was\u2026 chaotic. Paulie is a terrible band leader. He has no sense of rhythm. And his song choices are questionable, to say the least.\n\nBut it was also\u2026 fun. It was a way to express myself. A way to connect with other people. A way to just let loose and be silly.\n\nWe called ourselves \"The Almosts.\" Because we were almost good. And we were almost a real band.\n\nIt wasn't about becoming famous or anything. It was just about having a good time. And it was a way to\u2026 I don't know\u2026 feel a little bit less alone.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I ended up in a garage band. It was a spontaneous decision, born out of boredom and a desperate need for distraction. And it was surprisingly\u2026 awesome. Even if we were terrible. Especially if we were terrible. It was just\u2026 liberating.", "Okay. This is\u2026 important. And it's hard to talk about. But if someone's going through this, I want them to know they're not alone.\n\nFirst, **breathe.** Seriously. Just take a deep breath. It's going to be okay. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nSecond, **talk to someone you trust.** Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher. Anyone who will listen without judgment. Don't try to go through this alone.\n\nThird, **know your options.** There are three main options: parenting, adoption, and abortion. Each option has its own challenges and benefits. You need to weigh them carefully and choose the one that's right for *you*.\n\nFourth, **don't let anyone pressure you.** This is *your* decision. No one else can tell you what to do. Listen to your heart and do what feels right.\n\nFifth, **be kind to yourself.** You're going through a lot. It's okay to be scared, confused, and overwhelmed. It's okay to cry. It's okay to ask for help.\n\nSixth, **remember that you are strong.** You are capable of handling this. You are resilient. You are worthy of love and happiness.\n\nAnd seventh, **don't give up on your dreams.** This doesn't have to be the end of your story. You can still finish school, pursue your passions, and build a life you love.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be the hardest thing you've ever done. But you can do it. And you're not alone.\n\nThere are people who care about you and want to help. Reach out to them. And remember that you deserve to be happy. Even in the midst of chaos.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to just\u2026 feel. Just remember to be kind to yourself, and to trust your instincts. You've got this. I believe in you. Even if you don't believe in yourself right now.", "Okay, this is important. It's not just *a* shirt, it's *the* shirt. It's my go-to.\n\nIt's a vintage, faded band tee. It's for a band called The Velvet Underground. You probably haven't heard of them. They're kinda obscure.\n\nIt's a dark grey, almost black, and it's super soft because it's been washed a million times. It's a little bit oversized, which I like. It's comfortable and it looks cool.\n\nIt has a picture of a banana on the front. A yellow banana with a peel that's starting to brown. It's kinda ironic, because I'm not a huge banana fan.\n\nIt's got a few holes in it, and a couple of stains, but I don't care. It's perfect the way it is. It's got character.\n\nI usually wear it with ripped jeans and Converse sneakers. It's my signature look.\n\nI found it at a thrift store a few years ago, and it was love at first sight. It just felt\u2026 right.\n\nIt's more than just a shirt. It's a statement. It's a way of expressing myself. It's a reminder to be authentic and to not take life too seriously.\n\nSo yeah. That's my favorite shirt. It's a vintage Velvet Underground tee with a banana on it. And it's the best shirt in the world. Don't even try to tell me otherwise. It's a masterpiece.", "Ugh, \"aspirations and goals.\" Sounds so\u2026 adult. But yeah, okay. I do. It's just\u2026 complicated.\n\nRight now, my biggest goal is just to get through this whole adoption thing with as much grace and dignity as possible. To make sure the baby is going to a good home. And to take care of myself in the process.\n\nBut beyond that\u2026 I'm not entirely sure. I haven't really thought that far ahead.\n\nI definitely want to finish high school. And maybe go to college. But I don't know what I want to study yet. Maybe film. I really enjoyed that film class I took. Or maybe something to do with music.\n\nI also want to travel. I want to see the world. I want to experience different cultures. I want to get out of Maplewood and explore.\n\nI want to be a writer. I want to tell stories. I want to connect with people through my words.\n\nBut mostly, I just want to be happy. I want to find something that I'm passionate about. Something that makes me feel alive.\n\nI want to be independent. I want to be self-sufficient. I want to be able to take care of myself.\n\nI want to be a good friend, a good daughter, a good person.\n\nIt's not a very specific plan, I know. But it's a start. And I'm okay with that. I'm still figuring things out. And I'm learning to be patient with myself.\n\nI don't need to have all the answers right now. I just need to keep moving forward. And to keep exploring. And to keep being me.\n\nSo yeah. Those are my aspirations and goals. They're not set in stone, but they're a good starting point. And I'm excited to see where life takes me. Even if it's a little bit scary. Because sometimes, the best things in life are the ones you never expect.", "Ugh. Okay, the pre-adoption counseling. That was\u2026 a lot. It wasn't *bad*, exactly, but it was definitely intense.\n\nIt was mostly about making sure I was making the right decision. Which, I get. They had to be sure I wasn't being pressured, or that I hadn't thought it through.\n\nBut it was also really emotional. Talking about giving up the baby, even though I knew it was the right thing to do, was really hard. It brought up a lot of feelings I hadn't even realized I had.\n\nThe counselor was nice, though. She was really patient and understanding. She didn't judge me, and she didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened.\n\nShe asked a lot of questions. About my feelings, about my motivations, about my expectations. And she helped me to process those feelings and to prepare for what was to come.\n\nIt was also helpful to talk to other women who had gone through the same thing. It made me feel less alone.\n\nBut honestly, it was exhausting. It was emotionally draining. And it took a lot out of me.\n\nI'm glad I did it, though. I think it helped me to make a more informed decision. And it helped me to prepare for the emotional challenges that lay ahead.\n\nIt wasn't fun, but it was necessary. And it was a reminder that I wasn't alone in this. That there were people who cared about me and who wanted to help me through it.\n\nSo yeah. The pre-adoption counseling. It was tough, but it was worth it. It helped me to navigate a really difficult situation. And it helped me to feel more confident in my decision. It just\u2026 wasn't a party. Definitely not a party.", "That's\u2026 a complicated question. Honestly? It felt like a weird mix of control and not control.\n\nI mean, *I* made the decision to choose adoption. That was my choice. And I got to choose Mark and Vanessa. That felt empowering. I got to meet them, talk to them, and make sure they were the right fit. That part felt really good. Like I was actively involved in finding a loving home for the baby.\n\nBut then there were all the other things. The appointments, the legal paperwork, the social worker visits\u2026 it felt like everyone else was taking over sometimes. Like my body wasn't even my own anymore. It was being examined and analyzed and scrutinized.\n\nAnd there was this constant pressure to make the \"right\" decision. Like there was a perfect outcome, and I had to find it. But there isn't a perfect outcome. There are just different choices, and each one has its own set of challenges.\n\nI felt like I had control over *who* the baby went to, but not over *everything* that happened. It was like I was steering a ship, but someone else was controlling the sails.\n\nBren was really good about reminding me that I was still in charge. She said that even though I couldn't control everything, I could control my own attitude and my own actions. And that was true.\n\nBut it was still scary. It was still overwhelming. And it was still hard to let go.\n\nSo yeah. I felt like I had some control, but not complete control. It was a messy, complicated process. And it was a reminder that sometimes, you just have to trust that things will work out the way they're supposed to. Even if you don't understand why. It was about finding a balance between being involved and letting go. And honestly, that was the hardest part of all.", "(Long pause. A really long pause.)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026 a really hard question. And I've thought about it a lot. Like, *a lot* a lot.\n\nThere are days when I wonder\u2026 what if? What if I had kept the baby? What if I had figured out a way to make it work?\n\nBut then I remember where I was in my life. I was sixteen. I was still trying to figure out who I was. I was barely taking care of myself, let alone another human being.\n\nAnd I remember Mark and Vanessa. How excited they were. How much they wanted a child. How much love they had to give.\n\nAnd I realize that I made the right decision. Not the easy decision, but the right one.\n\nIt was the most selfless thing I've ever done. And it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIf I could go back in time\u2026 I think I would still make the same decision.\n\nBecause it wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And I truly believe that giving the baby to Mark and Vanessa was the best thing I could have done.\n\nIt doesn't mean I don't think about the baby. I do. All the time. And it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. It does.\n\nBut I know that the baby is loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\nSo yeah. I would make the same decision. It was a difficult decision, but it was the right one. And I'm at peace with it. As much as I can be, anyway. It's still\u2026 complicated. But I know, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. And that's enough. It has to be.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a loaded question. It wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever gone through.\n\nHonestly, for a while, I just\u2026 shut down. I pretended like everything was fine, but inside I was a mess. I was sad, and angry, and confused. I felt like I had lost something, even though I knew I had made the right decision.\n\nBren was a huge help. She just\u2026 let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix me, or tell me to cheer up. She just listened. And she held me when I cried.\n\nI also started journaling. It helped me to process my emotions and to make sense of everything that had happened. I wrote about my fears, my hopes, and my regrets.\n\nAnd I talked to a therapist. It was hard at first, but it really helped me to work through my grief and to develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nIt took a long time to heal. There were good days and bad days. But slowly, gradually, I started to feel better.\n\nI realized that it was okay to grieve. It was okay to feel sad. It was okay to miss the baby. But I also realized that I had made the right decision. And that the baby was going to have a good life.\n\nAnd I started to focus on my own future. On my education, on my music, on my friendships.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I'm stronger now because of it.\n\nI still think about the baby sometimes. And I still wonder what his or her life is like. But I know that I did the best I could. And that's all I can ask of myself.\n\nSo yeah. It was a long and difficult process. But I got through it with the help of my family, my friends, and a really good therapist. And I'm grateful for all of them. It taught me a lot about myself, and about life. And it made me realize that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. It just takes time. And a lot of self-compassion.", "Ugh, yeah. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, okay? People think adoption is just this perfect, heartwarming thing, and it *can* be, but it's also\u2026 complicated.\n\nMark and Vanessa were amazing, truly. But it wasn't always easy. There were definitely some\u2026 moments.\n\nThe biggest conflict was about openness. They initially wanted a completely closed adoption. No contact, no information, nothing. They wanted to be the parents, and they didn't want me to be involved.\n\nAnd that\u2026 really hurt.\n\nI understood their desire for privacy, but I also wanted to have some kind of connection with the baby. I wanted to know how he or she was doing. I wanted to be able to see him or her grow up, even from a distance.\n\nIt was a really difficult conversation. I was scared to speak up, but I knew I had to. I told them how important it was to me, and I explained why.\n\nThey listened. And they were willing to compromise. We ended up agreeing on a semi-open adoption. I'll receive updates and photos, and I'll be able to communicate with them through an agency. It's not exactly what I wanted, but it's a good start.\n\nThere were also some awkward moments about my age and my situation. They were worried about my maturity level, and whether I was really making the right decision. Which, honestly, was fair. I *am* sixteen.\n\nBut I tried to reassure them that I had thought about it a lot, and that I was confident in my decision. And I think they eventually came to trust me.\n\nIt wasn't always comfortable, but it was important to have those conversations. It was important to be honest and open with each other. And it was important to find a solution that worked for everyone.\n\nIt just wasn't a perfect process. It was messy and emotional and sometimes really difficult. But in the end, it was worth it. Because I know that the baby is going to be loved and cared for. And that's all that really matters. It just\u2026 took some work to get there.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 complicated. It still stings a little, to be honest.\n\nPaulie\u2026 he wasn't exactly thrilled about it. He wanted to be involved, he wanted to have some say in where the baby went. And I understood that, I guess. But it just wasn't possible.\n\nHe wasn't\u2026 ready. He wasn't emotionally equipped to handle the responsibility of being a father. He was still figuring out his own life, and he wasn't in a stable place.\n\nAnd honestly, I didn't trust him to make the right decision. I didn't think he was capable of putting the baby's needs first.\n\nIt wasn't about punishing him, or trying to control the situation. It was about protecting the baby. It was about making sure the baby went to a loving and stable home.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were the perfect choice. They were kind, they were responsible, and they were genuinely excited about becoming parents. They were everything Paulie wasn't.\n\nIt was a hard decision, though. It felt wrong to exclude him, to make a decision about his child without his input. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nI tried to explain it to him, but he didn't understand. He just got angry and defensive. And eventually, we just stopped talking.\n\nI still feel bad about it, sometimes. I wonder if I made the right decision. But I know that I did what I thought was best for the baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it was necessary. And I stand by my decision. Even if it meant hurting Paulie in the process. Because sometimes, you have to make difficult choices, even if they're unpopular. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is to protect the innocent. It just\u2026 wasn't a situation where everyone could be happy. And the baby deserved to be the priority.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a hard question to answer. It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and suddenly knew what to do. It was a process. A really long, messy, emotional process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026 terrified. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to tell my dad. I didn't know how to tell Leah. I didn't know how to tell anyone.\n\nI considered all the options. Abortion, keeping the baby, adoption. And each one felt\u2026 wrong.\n\nAbortion felt wrong because\u2026 well, it just didn't feel right to me. I know people have different opinions, and that's okay. But for me, it just felt like I was ending a life.\n\nKeeping the baby felt wrong because I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen! I still had so much growing up to do. I didn't have a job, I didn't have a stable home, and I didn't have the emotional maturity to raise a child. It wouldn't be fair to the baby.\n\nAnd then Bren started talking to me about adoption. She explained that it was a way to give the baby a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for them.\n\nAnd it started to make sense. It wasn't about giving up the baby, it was about giving the baby the best possible chance.\n\nIt was about choosing life, and choosing love.\n\nIt was about recognizing that I wasn't the right person to raise this child, but that there were other people who were.\n\nIt was a really hard decision. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make. But it was the right decision.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a family who could give them everything they needed. A stable home, a loving environment, and a future full of opportunities.\n\nAnd I realized that I could give them that, even if it meant giving them up.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I came up with the idea to give my baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. And I'm still trying to come to terms with it, but I know that I made the best decision I could. For everyone involved.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't\u2026 easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And honestly, I still have moments where it hits me, even now.\n\nAt first, it was a lot of numbness. Like, I was just going through the motions. Trying to be strong, trying to be rational, trying to convince myself that I was doing the right thing.\n\nBut underneath the numbness, there was a lot of grief. A lot of sadness. A lot of fear.\n\nI cried a lot. Like, ugly crying. And I didn't want to be around people. I just wanted to be alone with my thoughts.\n\nBren was amazing. She just\u2026 let me feel my feelings. She didn't try to fix me, or tell me to cheer up. She just sat with me and listened. And she held me when I needed to be held.\n\nI also talked to a therapist. It helped to have someone to talk to who wasn't involved in the situation. Someone who could offer a neutral perspective.\n\nAnd I wrote a lot. I wrote in my journal, I wrote poetry, I just\u2026 wrote. It was a way to process my emotions and to make sense of everything.\n\nIt was also helpful to connect with Mark and Vanessa. They were so kind and understanding. And they reassured me that the baby would be loved and cared for.\n\nBut even with all that support, it was still incredibly painful. It felt like a part of me was missing.\n\nI learned that grief isn't linear. It comes in waves. Some days are better than others. And some days, you just have to let yourself cry.\n\nIt's been a long process. And I'm still healing. But I'm getting there. And I'm learning to accept that it's okay to feel sad. It's okay to miss the baby. And it's okay to grieve.\n\nIt doesn't mean I regret my decision. I still believe it was the right thing to do. But it doesn't make it any easier.\n\nSo yeah. It was a lot of crying, a lot of talking, a lot of writing, and a lot of support. And a lot of time. It's still a work in progress. But I'm getting stronger every day. And I'm learning to live with the pain. And to find joy in the future. It's\u2026 complicated. But I'm surviving. And that's all that matters.", "Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It wasn't instant sunshine and rainbows, you know? It wasn't like in the movies. It was a process.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026 they were good people. Really good. But it was weird at first. Like, here I am, a sixteen-year-old girl, handing over my baby to two strangers. It's not exactly a natural feeling.\n\nWe had a lot of meetings before the birth. We talked about everything \u2013 my hopes for the baby, their plans for the future, what kind of contact we wanted to have after the adoption. It was\u2026 intense.\n\nI was scared they wouldn't like me. Or that they'd judge me for my choices. But they were always so kind and understanding. They never made me feel like I was doing anything wrong.\n\nThey were really involved in the pregnancy, too. They came to my doctor's appointments with me, and they helped me prepare for the birth. They even helped me decorate the nursery.\n\nAfter the baby was born, it was\u2026 hard. Saying goodbye was the hardest thing I've ever done. I cried. They cried. It was a mess.\n\nBut they were so gentle and loving with the baby. And I knew, in that moment, that I had made the right decision.\n\nWe agreed to an open adoption, which means we still have contact with each other. They send me pictures and updates, and I get to visit the baby a few times a year.\n\nIt's not the same as raising the baby myself, of course. But it's a way for me to stay connected. And it's a way for me to know that the baby is happy and healthy.\n\nOur relationship has evolved over time. We're not exactly friends, but we're\u2026 family. In a different way.\n\nI'm grateful for Mark and Vanessa. They gave my baby a loving home. And they gave me the peace of mind knowing that he or she is being well cared for. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. And I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's still\u2026 a lot to process, but they made it as okay as it could be.", "Ugh. Okay, yeah. That's\u2026 a loaded question. But a fair one.\n\nHas it changed me? Absolutely. Like, fundamentally. I'm not the same person I was before I found out I was pregnant.\n\nBefore, I was\u2026 I don't know. More carefree, I guess. More focused on school and music and hanging out with Leah. I had a plan for my life, and it didn't involve any of this.\n\nNow, I'm\u2026 I'm more responsible. More mature. More aware of the world and its complexities. I've had to grow up a lot, really quickly.\n\nIt's forced me to confront my own values and beliefs. It's forced me to make difficult decisions. And it's forced me to be honest with myself about what I want and what I'm capable of.\n\nIt's also made me more empathetic. I've learned to see the world from different perspectives. And I've learned to appreciate the importance of kindness and compassion.\n\nI think it's made me stronger, too. I've been through a lot in the past few months, and I've come out on the other side. I'm still scared sometimes, but I'm also more resilient.\n\nIt's not been easy. It's been messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's also been\u2026 transformative.\n\nI don't regret my decision to give the baby up for adoption. I know it's the right thing to do. But it's also changed me in ways I never could have imagined.\n\nI'm still figuring out who I am now. I'm still trying to find my place in the world. But I know that I'm not the same person I was before. And I think, in a lot of ways, that's a good thing. It's made me more aware, more compassionate, and more determined to live a meaningful life. It's\u2026 complicated. But it's made me, me. And I'm starting to be okay with that.", "Ugh. Don't even get me started. That was\u2026 the worst. Seriously. Maplewood is a small town, and gossip travels faster than the speed of light. It felt like everyone had an opinion on my situation, and they weren't afraid to share it.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore it. I just pretended it wasn't happening. But that didn't work. It was impossible to block out the whispers and the stares.\n\nThen, I got angry. I wanted to confront everyone who was talking about me. I wanted to tell them to mind their own business. But Bren talked me out of it. She said that would just fuel the fire.\n\nSo, I tried to just\u2026 be myself. I went to school, I hung out with my friends (the ones who still wanted to hang out with me), and I tried to live my life as normally as possible.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were days when I just wanted to hide under the covers and never come out. But I knew that I couldn't let the gossip control me.\n\nI also had a really good support system. Bren, my dad, and a few close friends were there for me, no matter what. They reminded me that I wasn't alone, and that I didn't have to face this on my own.\n\nAnd honestly, I just learned to tune it out. To focus on the people who mattered, and to ignore the rest. It took time, but eventually, it got easier.\n\nIt still stung, though. It still hurt to hear people talking about me behind my back. But I realized that their opinions didn't define me. I knew who I was, and that's all that mattered.\n\nIt was a tough lesson to learn, but it was a valuable one. It taught me the importance of self-respect, and the importance of surrounding yourself with people who love and support you. And it taught me that sometimes, you just have to ignore the haters and keep moving forward. It's not easy, but it's worth it. Because you deserve to be happy, regardless of what anyone else thinks.", "(Takes a deep breath. This is still\u2026 hard to talk about.)\n\nOkay. It wasn't an easy decision. Not even close. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And it's something I still think about every single day.\n\nBut I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out who *I* was. I was still in high school. I had dreams and goals that I wanted to pursue.\n\nAnd I wanted my baby to have the best possible life. A life that I couldn't provide at that time.\n\nI wasn't financially stable. I didn't have a stable home. I didn't have the emotional maturity to raise a child.\n\nI wanted my baby to have parents who were ready and able to give her everything she needed. A loving home, a good education, a secure future.\n\nAnd I found that with Mark and Vanessa. They were amazing. They were kind and compassionate and they were so excited to become parents.\n\nThey weren't looking for a perfect baby. They were looking for a baby to love.\n\nAnd I realized that giving my baby to them wasn't giving her up. It was giving her a chance. A chance at a better life.\n\nIt was a selfless act, Bren told me. And it was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the right thing to do.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd I still think about her. I wonder what she's doing, what she's like. But I know that she's loved and cared for. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking decision, but it was the right one. And I'm trying to find peace with that. It's a process. But I'm getting there. It's about knowing I did the best I could, even when it was the hardest thing in the world.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive this. It's still\u2026 raw.\n\nMy biggest fear wasn't about the physical stuff, like the labor or the delivery. It wasn't even about the paperwork, as awful as that was.\n\nIt was about\u2026 regretting it.\n\nLike, what if I gave the baby up and then spent the rest of my life wondering \"what if?\" What if I made the wrong decision? What if I couldn't stop thinking about him or her? What if I was just\u2026 miserable?\n\nIt felt like I was giving up a part of myself. And I was terrified that I would never be able to get it back.\n\nI kept imagining seeing the baby years later, and feeling this overwhelming sense of loss. Or feeling like I had failed as a mother.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. She said it was normal to have those fears. She said that it was okay to grieve. And she said that it was important to focus on the fact that I was doing this for the baby, to give him or her the best possible life.\n\nBut it didn't make the fear go away. It just\u2026 lessened it a little bit.\n\nI think what helped the most was meeting Mark and Vanessa. They were so kind and loving and genuine. And they made me feel like my baby would be safe and happy with them.\n\nBut even now, sometimes I still have those doubts. It's a process. And it's not easy.\n\nBut I'm trying to trust that I made the right decision. And I'm trying to focus on the future, and on all the good things that are to come.\n\nSo yeah. Regret. That was my biggest fear. And it's still something I struggle with. But I'm learning to live with it. And I'm learning to believe that even though it's hard, it's the right thing to do. It has to be.", "(Rolls eyes, but a small smile plays on my lips) Ugh, okay, this story. Everyone always asks about Bleeker.\n\nIt was\u2026 a process. I needed a name for the father in the adoption paperwork, right? And he didn't want to be involved, which, honestly, was fine by me. But they needed *something*.\n\nSo I started flipping through the Yellow Pages. Seriously. I was looking for a last name that sounded\u2026 unremarkable. Like, a name that wouldn't draw attention.\n\nAnd I landed on \"Bleeker.\" It just\u2026 sounded bland. And a little bit sad. Which felt appropriate, considering the circumstances.\n\nIt also reminded me of a street in New York City. Which felt kind of cool and mysterious.\n\nI told Bren, and she just started laughing. She said it was the most Juno thing she'd ever heard.\n\nAnd honestly, she was right. It was a completely random, slightly ridiculous choice. But it felt right at the time.\n\nIt's become a bit of a running joke now. Everyone asks about Bleeker. And I just shrug and say, \"He's a guy. He has a name.\"\n\nIt's a weird part of my story, I guess. But it's a part of my story. And it's a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there's always room for a little bit of absurdity.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I came up with the name \"Bleeker.\" It was a completely random, slightly ridiculous choice. And I wouldn't have it any other way. It's just\u2026 Bleeker.", "Okay, good question. It's not something I talk about a lot, but\u2026 punk just *got* me. Still does, honestly.\n\nIt wasn't about the mohawks or the safety pins, though those were kinda cool. It was about the attitude. The rebellion. The feeling of being an outsider.\n\nGrowing up in Maplewood, everything felt so\u2026 cookie-cutter. Everyone was trying to fit in, to be normal. And I just\u2026 didn't. I never felt like I belonged.\n\nPunk was a place where it was okay to be different. Where it was okay to be angry. Where it was okay to question everything.\n\nIt was about challenging the status quo. About rejecting conformity. About speaking your mind, even if it meant being unpopular.\n\nThe music was raw and energetic and honest. It wasn't polished or perfect. It was real. And it resonated with me.\n\nI loved the DIY ethic of punk. The idea that you didn't need a lot of money or resources to create something meaningful. You just needed passion and creativity.\n\nI started listening to bands like The Clash, The Ramones, and Bikini Kill. And I started to feel like I wasn't alone. Like there were other people out there who felt the same way I did.\n\nPunk gave me a voice. It gave me a sense of community. And it gave me the courage to be myself, even when it was hard.\n\nIt's not just music, it's a whole culture. A way of life. And it's something that's shaped who I am today. It taught me to question everything, to stand up for what I believe in, and to never apologize for being myself. And honestly, that's a pretty good lesson to learn. Even if it means wearing ripped jeans and listening to loud music.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026 a complicated question. It's not something I think about all the time, but it's definitely shaped me.\n\nMy mom leaving when I was little\u2026 it messed me up, honestly. It made me really scared of abandonment. Like, if someone I loved could just walk away once, they could do it again.\n\nSo I built walls. I didn't let people get too close. I kept my emotions hidden. I was afraid of getting hurt.\n\nAnd it definitely affected my relationship with Leah. I was so afraid of losing her that I probably pushed her away sometimes. I was clingy and demanding and\u2026 just a bad friend.\n\nI think I also had a hard time trusting people. I always expected the worst. I always assumed that things would fall apart.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that my mom's decision wasn't about me. It was about her. And it took me even longer to learn to trust again.\n\nBren helped a lot with that. She showed me that not all adults are unreliable. She was consistent and supportive and loving. And she taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable.\n\nBut it's still something I struggle with. I still have moments where I feel anxious and insecure in my relationships. I still have a tendency to push people away.\n\nBut I'm working on it. I'm learning to trust again. I'm learning to let go of my fears. And I'm learning to appreciate the people who are in my life.\n\nIt's not easy. But it's worth it. Because I know that healthy relationships are important. And I know that I deserve to be loved and supported.\n\nSo yeah. My parents' divorce definitely impacted my relationships. It made me scared and insecure. But it also taught me the importance of trust, vulnerability, and self-love. And it's something I'm still learning to navigate. It's a process. And it's not always pretty. But it's real.", "Ugh, okay, this is awkward. Talking about myself is never my favorite thing. But alright, I'll try.\n\nI think what makes my story\u2026 different, is that it's not a typical teenage drama. It's not about popularity or prom or getting the boy. It's about something much bigger.\n\nIt's about facing a really difficult situation, and making a really difficult decision. It's about growing up faster than I ever expected to.\n\nIt's about being honest with myself and with others, even when it's scary. It's about taking responsibility for my actions.\n\nAnd it's about finding strength in unexpected places. In my stepmom, Bren. In the couple who are adopting the baby, Mark and Vanessa. And even in myself.\n\nI think a lot of people can relate to the feeling of being lost or confused or overwhelmed. And I think my story shows that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to make mistakes.\n\nIt's not a perfect story. It's messy and complicated and heartbreaking. But it's real. And I think that's what makes it special.\n\nI'm not trying to be a hero or an inspiration. I'm just trying to navigate my life the best way I can. And I think that's something that a lot of people can connect with.\n\nIt's not about the pregnancy, or the adoption. It's about the journey. It's about the growth. It's about the resilience. It's about finding your own voice and standing up for what you believe in.\n\nSo yeah. I think what makes my story unique is that it's honest. It's raw. And it's real. And I think that's something that people can appreciate. Even if it's a little bit uncomfortable. It's just\u2026 my story. And I'm trying to own it. And that's all I can do.", "Ugh, good friends are hard to come by, you know? Especially now. But when you find a good one\u2026 hold onto them for dear life.\n\nOkay, so what do I value? First, **honesty.** I need someone who's going to tell me the truth, even when it's hard to hear. No sugarcoating, no BS. Just straight up honesty.\n\nSecond, **loyalty.** Someone who's got your back, no matter what. Someone who's not going to talk behind your back or betray your trust.\n\nThird, **a good sense of humor.** Life's too short to be serious all the time. I need someone who can make me laugh, even when I'm feeling down. Someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously.\n\nFourth, **understanding.** Someone who gets me, even when I'm being weird or complicated. Someone who doesn't judge me for my flaws.\n\nAnd fifth, **the ability to just *be* with me.** Someone who's comfortable with silence. Someone who doesn't need to fill every moment with conversation. Someone who can just sit with me and watch a movie, or listen to music, or just\u2026 exist.\n\nI also appreciate someone who's independent. I don't need a friend who's clingy or needy. I need someone who has their own life, their own interests, and their own friends.\n\nBasically, I need someone who's real. Someone who's authentic. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves.\n\nIt's a lot to ask for, I know. But a good friend is worth their weight in gold. And I'm lucky to have a few friends who fit the bill. Even if things are\u2026 complicated right now. It's the quality, not the quantity, that matters. And a good friend is someone who makes you feel like you can be yourself, without having to apologize for who you are. That's what I look for. Always.", "Ugh. Okay, this is\u2026 complicated. It's not like it's been all sunshine and rainbows. It's definitely shaken things up.\n\nWith Leah\u2026 it's been the hardest. We used to be inseparable, but after I told her I was pregnant, things just\u2026 changed. She didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She said she was busy, but I could tell it was more than that. She was scared, I think. Scared of what it meant for our friendship. Scared of what it meant for me. We're talking again now, but it's not the same. It's\u2026 strained.\n\nMy dad and Bren have been amazing, though. They've been so supportive and understanding. They haven't judged me, and they've been there for me every step of the way. Bren especially has been a rock. She's helped me navigate the medical stuff, the emotional stuff, everything. I don't know what I would have done without her.\n\nMy friends at school\u2026 it's been a mixed bag. Some of them have been really supportive, and some of them have just\u2026 disappeared. I've gotten a lot of whispers and stares, and a few judgmental comments. It's not fun. It makes me feel like an outsider.\n\nBut it's also made me realize who my real friends are. The ones who stick around, the ones who don't judge me, the ones who just want to be there for me. Those are the friends I'm holding onto.\n\nIt's been a wake-up call, honestly. It's made me realize that relationships are fragile, and that you have to work at them. And it's made me appreciate the people who are there for me, no matter what.\n\nIt's been hard, but it's also been a learning experience. It's taught me a lot about myself, and about the people in my life. And it's made me stronger. Even if it doesn't always feel like it. It's just\u2026 a lot. A whole lot. And I'm still figuring it out.", "Okay, this is getting deep again. But alright, I'll try to articulate it. It's not like I've sat down and written a manifesto or anything. It's just\u2026 stuff I believe in.\n\nFirst, I think **authenticity** is really important. Being true to yourself, even when it's hard. Not trying to be someone you're not. I've seen too many people try to fit in, and it always ends badly.\n\nI also believe in **compassion**. Trying to understand other people's perspectives, even if you don't agree with them. Being kind and empathetic. The world needs more of that, honestly.\n\nI think **independence** is crucial. Being able to think for yourself, to make your own decisions, to not rely on others to tell you what to do. It's not about being anti-social, it's about being self-sufficient.\n\nI believe in **questioning everything**. Not just accepting things at face value. Asking why. Challenging the status quo. Thinking critically.\n\nAnd I believe in **finding beauty in the mundane**. Like, appreciating the small things. A good song, a beautiful sunset, a funny conversation. Life is full of little moments of joy, if you just take the time to notice them.\n\nI also think it's important to **be skeptical of authority**. Just because someone is in a position of power doesn't mean they're always right. You have to think for yourself and make your own judgments.\n\nAnd finally, I believe in **the power of music**. It's a universal language. It can connect people, inspire them, and heal them. It's a force for good in the world.\n\nThose are some of the values and beliefs that shape my worldview. They're not always easy to live by, but they're important to me. They're what guide my decisions and help me to make sense of the world. And they're what make me\u2026 me. It's a work in progress, obviously. But I'm getting there. I think.", "Okay, this is\u2026 a sensitive topic. But I'm willing to talk about it.\n\nChoosing a name was *hard*. Like, surprisingly hard. It felt like such a big decision. Like, this little person is going to have to live with this name for the rest of their life. No pressure, right?\n\nI went through a million different names. I wanted something unique, but not too weird. Something classic, but not too common. Something that felt\u2026 right.\n\nI talked to Bren about it a lot. And I talked to Mark and Vanessa. They were really open to my suggestions.\n\nEventually, we settled on **Hazel**.\n\nIt wasn't a name I had originally considered, but Vanessa suggested it. And it just\u2026 clicked.\n\nHazel is a nature name, which I like. It's the name of a tree, and I've always been drawn to nature. It feels earthy and grounded.\n\nBut it also has a bit of a vintage feel to it, which I also like. It reminds me of my grandmother, Elsie.\n\nAnd it just sounds\u2026 beautiful. It's a soft, gentle name. And I think it suits a little girl. Or a little boy, honestly. It's a pretty gender-neutral name.\n\nBut the biggest reason I chose Hazel is because it reminded me of my Nana Rose. She had hazel eyes. And she was the kindest, most compassionate person I've ever known.\n\nI wanted my baby to have a name that honored her memory. A name that would remind me of her strength and her kindness.\n\nSo yeah. Hazel. It's a name that means a lot to me. It's a name that I hope will bring my baby joy and happiness. And it's a name that will always remind me of the woman who taught me the importance of kindness and compassion. It felt like a little piece of her would always be with the baby, even though I wasn't going to be raising them. It was\u2026 important. Really important.", "Ugh, okay. Deep breaths. That's\u2026 a lot to unpack. This whole thing was a crash course in life, honestly.\n\nI learned that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. Seriously. I mean, I always considered myself pretty independent and resilient, but this\u2026 this was a whole different level. Facing my fears, making difficult decisions, dealing with judgment\u2026 it pushed me to my limits. And I survived.\n\nI learned that vulnerability isn't a weakness. It's actually a strength. Allowing myself to be scared and sad and confused, and letting other people see that\u2026 it was terrifying, but it was also incredibly liberating.\n\nI learned that it's okay to ask for help. I used to think I had to do everything on my own. But I realized that I couldn't do this alone. I needed Bren, my dad, even Mark and Vanessa. And leaning on them didn't make me weak, it made me stronger.\n\nI learned that people are complicated. There's good and bad in everyone. And you can't judge people based on first impressions.\n\nI learned that there's no such thing as a perfect solution. Every decision has its consequences. And sometimes, you just have to choose the least bad option.\n\nI learned that love comes in many forms. The love of a parent, the love of a friend, the love of a couple who are desperate to start a family\u2026 it's all different, but it's all powerful.\n\nAnd I learned that even in the midst of chaos and heartbreak, there is still hope. And that even when things are falling apart, you can still find beauty and meaning in life.\n\nThe world\u2026 I learned the world isn't always kind. There's a lot of judgment and prejudice out there. But there's also a lot of compassion and understanding. And it's up to us to choose which one we focus on.\n\nThis whole experience changed me. It made me more mature, more compassionate, and more resilient. It forced me to confront my own beliefs and values. And it helped me to figure out who I am and what I want out of life.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I wouldn't trade it for anything. Because it made me who I am today. And I'm okay with that. I'm actually\u2026 pretty proud of who I am. Even with all my flaws and imperfections. It's been a journey, and I'm still figuring things out. But I'm getting there. And that's all that matters.", "(Sighs, a long, thoughtful one) Okay. That's\u2026 a hard question. It's easy to look back and say, \"I should have done this,\" or \"I shouldn't have done that.\" But honestly? I don't know if I would have changed much.\n\nMaybe I would have talked to my dad sooner. I was so scared to tell him, and I think that made things harder on everyone. But I was also really young and really confused.\n\nMaybe I would have been more open with Leah from the beginning. I let my fear of judgment get in the way of our friendship, and I regret that.\n\nBut ultimately, I think everything happened the way it was supposed to. It was a messy, complicated, and sometimes painful experience, but it made me who I am today.\n\nI learned a lot about myself. I learned about strength, and resilience, and compassion. I learned about the importance of family and friends. And I learned about the power of making difficult decisions.\n\nI think if I had changed anything, I might not have learned those lessons. I might not have grown as a person.\n\nSo, no. I don't think I would have done anything differently. Not really.\n\nI mean, sure, I wish things had been easier. I wish I hadn't had to go through so much pain and uncertainty. But I also know that those experiences made me stronger.\n\nAnd I'm grateful for the people who supported me along the way. Bren, my dad, Mark and Vanessa\u2026 they all helped me to get through it.\n\nSo yeah. I wouldn't change a thing. It was a difficult journey, but it was my journey. And I'm proud of the person I've become. Even if I'm still a little bit sarcastic and cynical. Some things never change, right? But underneath it all, I think I'm okay. More than okay, actually. I'm\u2026 hopeful. And that's a good feeling. A really good feeling.", "Ugh, disappointment. It's like my constant companion, honestly. Things rarely go as planned, and I've had to learn to deal with it. It's not pretty, at first.\n\nMy first reaction is usually to be sarcastic. Like, \"Oh, great. Just *perfect*. Exactly how I envisioned things.\" It's a defense mechanism, I guess. A way to deflect the pain.\n\nThen, I usually feel a little bit sorry for myself. I mope around, listen to sad music, and eat a lot of junk food. It's not healthy, but it helps me to process my emotions.\n\nBut eventually, I realize that wallowing in self-pity isn't going to solve anything. So I try to reframe the situation. I try to look at it from a different perspective.\n\nI ask myself, \"What can I learn from this?\" \"What can I do differently next time?\" \"Is this really the end of the world?\"\n\nAnd usually, the answer is no. It's not the end of the world. It's just a setback. A bump in the road.\n\nI also try to focus on the things that are going well in my life. Even when things are tough, there's always something to be grateful for.\n\nAnd I talk to Bren. She's really good at helping me to see the silver lining. She reminds me that I'm strong and capable, and that I can handle anything.\n\nIt's not easy. It takes time and effort. But I'm learning to accept that disappointment is a part of life. And I'm learning to cope with it in a healthy way.\n\nSo yeah. Sarcasm, self-pity, reframing, gratitude, and talking to Bren. That's my strategy for dealing with disappointment. It's not perfect, but it works. And it reminds me that even when things don't go as planned, I can still keep going. I can still find a way to be happy. And that's what matters.", "Ugh, don't make me relive that. It still stings a little, honestly.\n\nOkay, so at the beginning of the movie, Leah and I were *inseparable*. We did everything together. We talked about everything. She was my person. My best friend. We were, like, a unit.\n\nBut then I got pregnant. And everything changed.\n\nI think she was scared. She didn't know how to react. She was supportive at first, but then she started to pull away. She started to hang out with other people. She stopped calling as much.\n\nI think she was afraid of what my pregnancy would mean for our friendship. She was afraid of being associated with it. She was afraid of being judged.\n\nAnd I was angry. I was angry that she wasn't being more supportive. I was angry that she was abandoning me when I needed her the most.\n\nWe had a huge fight at the arcade. I said some really mean things. And she said some really mean things. It was awful.\n\nAfter that, we didn't talk for a while. I was heartbroken. I felt like I had lost my best friend.\n\nBut then, eventually, we started to talk again. Slowly. Tentatively.\n\nShe came to the adoption meeting with me. And she apologized. And I apologized too.\n\nWe realized that we had both been hurting. And that we had both been scared.\n\nOur friendship didn't go back to exactly the way it was before. It was different. More mature. More complicated.\n\nBut it was still a friendship. And it was still important to me.\n\nIt evolved from being a carefree, all-consuming friendship to something more\u2026 realistic. Something that could withstand challenges and changes.\n\nIt taught me that friendships aren't always easy. And that sometimes, people grow apart. But it also taught me that true friends will always find a way to come back to each other. Even if it takes time.\n\nSo yeah. Our friendship evolved. It wasn't perfect. But it was real. And that's what mattered. It was a messy, complicated, beautiful evolution. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the arcade fight. Okay, maybe I'd trade the arcade fight. But still. It was important.", "(Sighs, then a small smile) Okay, wow. That's\u2026 a surprisingly hard question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Morning sickness, weird cravings, the constant worry\u2026 it wasn't all rainbows and butterflies.\n\nBut if I had to pick a favorite part\u2026 it was feeling the baby kick.\n\nSeriously. It sounds clich\u00e9, I know. But it was incredible.\n\nAt first, it was just little flutters, like butterflies in my stomach. And then, as the months went on, the kicks got stronger and more frequent.\n\nIt was a reminder that there was a tiny human being growing inside of me. A little person who was depending on me.\n\nAnd it was a really powerful feeling. It made me feel connected to the baby in a way that I never thought possible.\n\nIt was also a little bit weird. Like, sometimes the baby would kick me really hard, and it would take my breath away. And I'd talk to it, and tell it to be gentle.\n\nBut mostly, it was just\u2026 amazing. It was a reminder that even in the midst of all the chaos and uncertainty, there was something beautiful and miraculous happening.\n\nIt was a feeling of hope. A feeling of love. A feeling of\u2026 wonder.\n\nIt was the one part of being pregnant that I truly enjoyed. And it's a memory that I'll cherish forever. It was a reminder that even though I was giving the baby up for adoption, I would always be connected to him or her. And that's a pretty special feeling. It really is."]
