The correct form is **\"I graduated\"** (simple past tense). The passive construction \"am graduated\" is not used in this context. Native speakers do not say \"I am graduated\" \u2014 they say \"I graduated.\"\n- The use of **\"am graduated\"** is a common error among non-native speakers, especially those whose first language does not use the passive voice in this way (e.g., in many Asian and European languages, the passive is more commonly used in past contexts).\n\n#### **Passage 2:**\n> *I graduated from high school in 2003.

This clearly indicates that the SDGs were developed as a continuation or evolution of the MDGs, building upon them.\n\nParagraph B claims that \"the SDGs are an extension of the MDGs,\" which is directly supported by the information in Paragraph A. The fact that the SDGs were created as successors to the MDGs\u2014after a 15-year period and with a broader scope\u2014confirms that they are an extension.\n\nTherefore, **Paragraph A proves that the statement in Paragraph B is true.**", "We are given two positive integers:  \n**A = 15**, **B = 30**  \nWe are to find the **sum of all odd numbers between A and B, inclusive**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List all numbers from 15 to 30:\n15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the **odd numbers** in this range:\nOdd numbers are those not divisible by 2.\n\nFrom the list:\n- 15 \u2705\n- 17 \u2705\n- 19 \u2705\n- 21 \u2705\n- 23 \u2705\n- 25 \u2705\n- 27 \u2705\n- 29 \u2705\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Add them up:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the sum:\n\n15 + 17 = 32  \n32 + 19 = 51  \n51 + 21 = 72  \n72 + 23 = 95  \n95 + 25 = 120  \n120 + 27 = 147  \n147 + 29 = **176**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n**176**", "We are given:\n\n- **N** = number of boys  \n- **M** = number of girls  \n- A list of **N** distinct boy names  \n- A list of **M** distinct girl names  \n\nWe are to determine whether **at least one configuration exists** such that:\n\n> **No boy is paired with a girl who has the same name.**\n\nNote:  \n- Each boy is paired with **one girl** (so we form **N** pairs).  \n- There are **M** girls, and **N \u2264 M** (since we can't pair more boys than girls).  \n- The pairing is **random**, but we are to check if **at least one valid pairing exists** where **no pair has the same name**.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Check if N > M** \u2192 If so, it's impossible to pair all boys (since we need M \u2265 N). But the problem says \"each boy is randomly paired with a girl\", so we assume **N \u2264 M**.\n\n2. **We need to check if there exists a matching from boys to girls (injective, since each boy gets one girl, and no girl is used more than once) such that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name.**\n\n3. This is a **bipartite matching problem**:\n   - Left side: boys\n   - Right side: girls\n   - Edge between boy and girl if their names are **different**\n   - We want to know if there exists a **matching of size N** (i.e., all boys are matched to some girl, no name conflict)\n\n4. We can solve this using **Hall\u2019s Marriage Theorem** or by **constructing a bipartite graph and checking for a perfect matching**.\n\nBut since the input is small (N \u2264 100, M \u2264 100), we can simulate a **greedy matching** or use **DFS-based matching (augmenting path)**.\n\nHowever, for simplicity and correctness, we can use **a greedy approach with backtracking** or **a standard bipartite matching algorithm**.\n\nBut let\u2019s think: **Can we do it without full matching?**\n\nActually, **if there is any boy whose name appears in the list of girls, then he cannot be paired with a girl of that name.**\n\nBut if **all boys have names that are not in the girls' list**, then **any pairing is valid** \u2192 answer is **Yes**.\n\nBut if **some boys have names that appear in the girls' list**, then we must avoid pairing them with the girl of the same name.\n\nSo the key is: **Is there a way to assign each boy a girl (no repeats) such that no boy is assigned a girl with the same name?**\n\nThis is equivalent to:  \n> Does a **matching exist** in the bipartite graph where edges exist only between boys and girls with **different names**?\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1.

Check if there exists a **matching of size N** (i.e., all boys can be matched)  \n6.

But the sentence says \"unannounced,\" which contradicts the idea of an appointment. \u274c  \n2. **solicitation** \u2013 This refers to an attempt to obtain something, often money or support, and carries a negative or formal connotation. It doesn\u2019t fit naturally in the context of someone simply showing up at a door. \u274c  \n3. **meeting** \u2013 This can refer to a planned or unplanned encounter.

The keyword \"calendar\" appears in the second sentence, indicating that it is about the same topic.\n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "To solve this problem, let\u2019s carefully analyze the scenario step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register can serve **one customer at a time**.\n- **No limit** on the number of items a customer can buy \u2014 so service time depends on the customer, not the number of items.\n- **First register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- **Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available** \u2014 this is a key phrase.\n\nWait \u2014 this wording is ambiguous. Let\u2019s clarify:\n\n> \"Subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that the **registers are not all open at 8:00 am**. Instead, the second register opens only when the first becomes free, and the third only when the second becomes free.\n\nBut that contradicts the usual interpretation of a retail store with multiple registers. Let\u2019s re-express the logic.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the passage says:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is **not** standard. It implies that the **second register opens only when the first register becomes free** \u2014 which would mean the second register is not open until the first finishes serving its first customer.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make sense in a real-world context. More likely, the intended meaning is that **each register opens at a certain time**, and **customers are assigned to the first available register**.\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is **very strange**. It implies that the **second register doesn\u2019t open until the first register finishes its first customer**.\n\nBut that would mean the second register is not open at 8:00 am \u2014 only after the first register becomes free.\n\nBut then, if the first register is busy, the second doesn\u2019t open until the first is free.\n\nThis would mean **only one register is ever open at a time** \u2014 which contradicts the idea of three registers.\n\nSo this must be a **misinterpretation**.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read carefully:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis is **not** standard. It suggests a **chain**: register 2 opens when register 1 becomes free, register 3 opens when register 2 becomes free.\n\nBut that would mean **only one register is ever open at a time** \u2014 which is not typical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended meaning is that **registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, and 8:30 am**, but the phrasing is misleading.\n\nBut the question says: \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am, when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nSo we must assume that **all three registers are in use at 8:30 am**.\n\nBut when did they open?\n\nThe first register opens at 8:00 am.\n\nThe second opens as soon as the first becomes available.\n\nThe third opens as soon as the second becomes available.\n\nSo the **second register opens only after the first finishes**.\n\nBut if the first register is still in use at 8:30 am, then the second register has not opened yet.\n\nBut the question says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo all three must be open.\n\nTherefore, the only way this can happen is if **all three registers are open at 8:00 am**.\n\nSo the phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" must be **misinterpreted**.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it means that **registers open at 8:00 am, 8:15 am, and 8:30 am**, but the phrasing is poor.\n\nBut the passage says: \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThat implies **sequential opening**.\n\nBut if the first register is busy, the second doesn\u2019t open until the first is free.\n\nSo if the first register is busy from 8:00 am onward, the second register never opens.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they must all be open.\n\nTherefore, the only logical interpretation is that **all three registers open at 8:00 am**.\n\nThe phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" must be a **misstatement**.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it means that **customers are assigned to the first available register**, and the registers are all open from 8:00 am.\n\nThat is the only way the scenario makes sense.\n\nSo let\u2019s assume:\n\n- All three registers are open at 8:00 am.\n- Customers are served one at a time per register.\n- The fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n- All three registers are in use at 8:30 am.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long each customer takes.\n\nThe question doesn\u2019t give any service time.\n\nSo how can we answer?\n\nWait \u2014 the question is: \"when will the fourth customer be able to start using a register?\"\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the current customers are taking.\n\nSo unless we assume a standard service time, we can\u2019t answer.\n\nBut the answer choices are specific: 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo there must be an implied service time.\n\nPerhaps the intended meaning is that **each customer takes 15 minutes**.\n\nThat\u2019s a common assumption in such problems.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that.\n\nSo:\n\n- Register 1: starts at 8:00 am with customer 1.\n- Register 2: starts at 8:00 am with customer 2.\n- Register 3: starts at 8:00 am with customer 3.\n\nEach takes 15 minutes.\n\nSo:\n\n- Customer 1 finishes at 8:15 am.\n- Customer 2 finishes at 8:15 am.\n- Customer 3 finishes at 8:15 am.\n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo all three registers are free at 8:15 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer could start at 8:15 am.\n\nBut that\u2019s not in the choices.\n\nChoices start at 8:35.\n\nSo that can\u2019t be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the service time is longer.\n\nPerhaps each customer takes 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Customer 2: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Customer 3: 8:00\u20138:30\n\nAll finish at 8:30 am.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 is not in the choices.\n\nChoices are 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nSo not 8:30.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the registers open at different times.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to the original phrasing:\n\n> \"The first register opens at 8:00 am, and subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available.\"\n\nThis suggests that **register 2 opens only when register 1 becomes available**.\n\nBut if register 1 is busy, register 2 doesn\u2019t open.\n\nSo if register 1 is serving a customer from 8:00 am, register 2 doesn\u2019t open until 8:00 + service time.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know service time.\n\nBut the question says: \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they must all be open.\n\nSo register 2 must have opened before 8:30 am.\n\nSo register 1 must have become available before 8:30 am.\n\nBut when?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: opens at 8:00 am, serves customer 1 from 8:00\u20138:15.\n- Register 2 opens at 8:15 am (when register 1 becomes available).\n- Register 2 serves customer 2 from 8:15\u20138:30.\n- Register 3 opens at 8:30 am (when register 2 becomes available).\n- Register 3 serves customer 3 from 8:30\u20138:45.\n\nNow, fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nBut register 3 is just opening at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use:\n\n- Register 1: free (finished at 8:15)\n- Register 2: busy (8:15\u20138:30)\n- Register 3: just starting (8:30\u20138:45)\n\nSo only register 1 is free at 8:30 am.\n\nSo the fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 is not in the choices.\n\nChoices start at 8:35.\n\nSo not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the service time is 30 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Register 1: 8:00\u20138:30\n- Register 2 opens at 8:30 am (when register 1 becomes available)\n- Register 2: 8:30\u20139:00\n- Register 3 opens at 9:00 am (when register 2 becomes available)\n- Register 3: 9:00\u20139:30\n\nBut at 8:30 am, only register 1 is in use (8:00\u20138:30), register 2 and 3 are not open yet.\n\nSo only one register in use.\n\nBut the question says \"all three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nSo the only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if they are all open and busy.\n\nSo they must all be open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" must be a red herring or misphrased.\n\nPerhaps it means that **customers are assigned to the first available register**, and the registers are all open from 8:00 am.\n\nThat is the only way the scenario makes sense.\n\nSo assume:\n\n- All three registers open at 8:00 am.\n- Each customer takes 15 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Customer 2: 8:00\u20138:15\n- Customer 3: 8:00\u20138:15\n\nAll free at 8:15 am.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they can start at 8:15 am.\n\nBut 8:15 is not in the choices.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAlternatively, service time is

am.\n\nBut why would service time be 45 minutes?\n\nThe problem doesn't say.\n\nBut perhaps the intended interpretation is that the registers open at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only two registers are open.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first register opens at 8:00 am.\n\nThe second opens at 8:15 am.\n\nThe third opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut then at 8:30 am, only the third register is open.\n\nBut the question says all three are in use.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nUnless the first register is still in use.\n\nBut if the first register opened at 8:00 am, and service time is 30 minutes, it finishes at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, it becomes available.\n\nThen the second register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nBut the second register was supposed to open when the first becomes available.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, second register opens.\n\nBut the third register opens when the second becomes available.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, second register opens and starts serving.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, all three registers are in use:\n\n- Register 1: just finished at 8:30 am? Or still serving?\n\nIf it finishes at 8:30 am, it is available.\n\nBut the second register opens at 8:30 am.\n\nSo at 8:30 am, register 1 is free, register 2 starts, register 3 is not open yet.\n\nSo only two registers in use.\n\nNot three.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nThe only way all three are in use at 8:30 am is if they are all open and busy.\n\nSo they must all be open at 8:00 am.\n\nSo the phrase \"subsequent registers open as soon as the previous register becomes available\" must be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps it means that **customers are assigned to the first available register**, and the registers are all open from 8:00 am.\n\nAnd each customer takes 45 minutes.\n\nThen:\n\n- Customer 1: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Customer 2: 8:00\u20138:45\n- Customer 3: 8:00\u20138:45\n\nAll finish at 8:45 am.\n\nFourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.\n\nSo they must wait until 8:45 am.\n\nSo they can start at 8:45 am.\n\nAnswer: B) 8:45 am.\n\nThis is the only choice that makes sense.\n\nSo likely, the intended service time is 45 minutes.\n\nOr perhaps the first customer takes 30 minutes, but the second takes 30 minutes, but the third takes 30 minutes, but the fourth arrives at 8:30 am, and the first register becomes available at 8:30 am, but the second at 8:30 am, but the third at 8:30 am, but if they all start at 8:00 am, and take 30 minutes, they finish at 8:30 am.\n\nSo fourth customer can start at 8:30 am.\n\nBut 8:30 is not in the choices.\n\nSo not possible.\n\nUnless the service time is 45 minutes.\n\nSo the only logical answer is B) 8:45 am.\n\nSo I think the intended answer is B) 8:45 am.\n\n**Answer: B) 8:45 am**", "Let's analyze each sentence one by one, **case-insensitively**, and count how many **letters appear exactly once** in the sentence.\n\nWe will:\n- Convert the sentence to lowercase.\n- Count the frequency of each letter (a\u2013z).\n- Count how many letters appear **only once** (i.e., frequency = 1).\n- Ignore non-letter characters (spaces, punctuation, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### Sentence 1: `'This is an example'`\n\n1.

This contrast is deeply rooted in human psychology and evolution\u2014our brains are wired to respond quickly to red as a warning signal, much like a fire or blood, triggering alertness and caution. In contrast, green evokes calm and growth, often linked to nature, life, and the absence of threat. These associations are reflected in everyday life: traffic lights use red to stop and green to go, and emergency signs are often red, while safety instructions and exits are marked in green. This powerful visual language helps guide behavior instinctively, even before we consciously think about it.", "**Best Response: Online Forum**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- **Complexity:** The question *\"Should I start my own business?\"* is **complex**. It involves personal financial risk, market research, emotional readiness, industry knowledge, and long-term planning\u2014factors that require nuanced, individualized advice. A simple \"yes\" or \"no\" is insufficient.\n\n- **Specificity:** The question is **general**. It does not reference a specific industry, business idea, financial situation, or personal context. Without details, it cannot be meaningfully addressed by a single friend, even a well-meaning one, without guesswork.\n\n- **Target Person:** The target is a **friend**, not a professional advisor. While friends can offer emotional support, they are not equipped to provide comprehensive, data-driven guidance on entrepreneurship\u2014especially without knowing the full context.\n\n- **Best Option:** An **online forum** (e.g., Reddit\u2019s r/Entrepreneur, Quora, or industry-specific communities) is better suited because:\n  - It allows for diverse perspectives from people with real-world experience.\n  - It enables the asker to provide more details and receive tailored advice.\n  - It reduces the risk of biased or uninformed opinions from someone who may not understand the stakes.\n\nWhile a friend can offer encouragement or a listening ear, the **complexity and generality** of the question make an **online forum** the more appropriate and effective resource."]
