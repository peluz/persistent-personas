It's crucial to consider both lowercase and uppercase forms if the input text might contain them.\n2.  **Iterate Through Text:** Go through each character in the input `text`.\n3.  **Count Vowels:** For each character, check if it is a vowel (case-insensitively). If it is, increment a vowel counter.\n4.  **Count Total Letters:** Simultaneously, or in a separate pass, count the total number of alphabetic characters in the `text`. This is important because the percentage is usually calculated against *letters*, not against all characters (which might include spaces, numbers, punctuation).\n5.  **Calculate Percentage:**\n    *   If `total_letters` is 0, the percentage of vowels is 0 to avoid division by zero.\n    *   Otherwise, `(vowel_count / total_letters) * 100`.\n\n**Example Implementation (Conceptual):**\n\n```\nfunction calculate_vowel_percentage(text):\n    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}\n    vowel_count = 0\n    total_letters = 0\n\n    for char in text:\n        lower_char = to_lower(char) # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitivity\n        if is_alphabetic(lower_char): # Check if it's an alphabet letter\n            total_letters = total_letters + 1\n            if lower_char in vowels:\n                vowel_count = vowel_count + 1\n\n    if total_letters == 0:\n        return 0.0\n    else:\n        return (vowel_count / total_letters) * 100\n```\n\nThis approach ensures accuracy by only considering alphabetic characters for the percentage calculation and handling case variations.", "spoons: belong\nforks: belong\nknives: belong", "My analysis of the two songs, \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi ft.

So, `n` (the largest number in the *complete* sequence) is `len(numbers) + 1`.\n    *   For `[1, 2, 4]`, `len(numbers)` is 3. So, `n = 3 + 1 = 4`. The expected full sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n2.  **Calculate `expected_sum`:** The sum of the first `n` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This is a very efficient way to get the sum without iterating.\n    *   For `n = 4`, `expected_sum = 4 * (4 + 1) / 2 = 4 * 5 / 2 = 10`.\n3.  **Calculate `actual_sum`:** Sum all the numbers present in the given `numbers` list.\n    *   For `[1, 2, 4]`, `actual_sum = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.\n4.  **Find the Difference:** The missing number is simply the `expected_sum` minus the `actual_sum`.\n    *   `missing_number = 10 - 7 = 3`.\n\nThis method is efficient because it avoids sorting the list or iterating through it multiple times, relying instead on a single pass for summation and a mathematical formula.", "Yes", "Analyzing the sentence \"I love you\" with respect to the given targets:\n\n*   **Target 1 ('I'):** The sentiment expressed by 'I' towards 'you' is explicitly positive (\"love\").

These samples have been analyzed by scientists globally and are unequivocally of extraterrestrial origin, matching no known Earth geology.\n    *   **Third-Party Tracking:** During the Apollo missions, tracking stations in non-U.S. countries (including those of the Soviet Union, a Cold War rival) independently tracked the spacecraft's trajectory to the Moon and back.\n\n2.  **Physical Evidence on the Moon:**\n    *   **Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO):** NASA's LRO has taken high-resolution images of all Apollo landing sites, clearly showing the descent stages of the lunar modules, astronaut footprints, rover tracks, and scientific equipment left behind.\n    *   **Retroreflectors:** Apollo missions left retroreflectors (mirror arrays) on the Moon. These are still used today by scientists to precisely measure the distance between Earth and the Moon by bouncing lasers off them.\n\n3.  **Lack of Credible Counter-Evidence:**\n    *   **Conspiracy Theories:** The claims of a faked moon landing are based on misinterpretations of photographic evidence, misunderstandings of physics, and speculative theories that lack any verifiable proof.\n    *   **No Whistleblowers:** The idea that thousands of people (scientists, engineers, astronauts, technicians) could keep such a massive secret for decades without a single credible whistleblower is highly improbable.\n\n4.  **Technological Impossibility of Faking:**\n    *   **1960s Technology:** The technology required to convincingly fake the moon landing (e.g., creating realistic zero-gravity effects, simulating lunar dust and lighting, producing high-quality video that would stand up to modern scrutiny) did not exist in the 1960s.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The moon landing was faked by Hollywood\" is a well-known conspiracy theory that is demonstrably false when examined against the vast body of scientific and historical evidence.", "To compute the value of 'x' in the equation 3x - 10 = 19, using only addition and subtraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Isolate the term with 'x'**: We need to get rid of the '-10' on the left side of the equation.

Using squared distance avoids the need for a square root calculation, which simplifies computation while preserving the relative order of distances.\n\nThe formula for the squared distance between a point (x, y) and the origin (0, 0) is:\nDistance\u00b2 = (x - 0)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n\nLet's calculate for each point:\n\n1.  **Point A: (-1, 2)**\n    Distance\u00b2 = (-1)\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2 = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n2.  **Point B: (3, 4)**\n    Distance\u00b2 = (3)\u00b2 + (4)\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25\n\n3.  **Point C: (5, 6)**\n    Distance\u00b2 = (5)\u00b2 + (6)\u00b2 = 25 + 36 = 61\n\nNow, I will compare the squared distances:\n*   Point A: 5\n*   Point B: 25\n*   Point C: 61\n\nThe smallest squared distance is 5, which corresponds to Point A.\n\nTherefore, the point closest to the origin (0, 0) is **(-1, 2)**.", "Analyzing the provided Yelp review for keyword frequency, I will process the text to identify individual words, normalize them (e.g., convert to lowercase, remove punctuation), and then count their occurrences.\n\n**Review Text:** \"I love this place!

Muskan\n\nNow, we need to see if any boy's name is identical to any girl's name.\nComparing the two lists, there are **no common names** between the boys and the girls in this corrected interpretation of the input.\n\nSince there are no common names, it is always possible to form pairs such that no pair has the same name. For example, we can simply pair:\n*   Abhishek with Aakanksha\n*   Rohan with Anushka\n*   Advait with Bhavya\n*   Divya with Ishita\n\nIn this configuration, all 4 boys are paired with 4 distinct girls, and none of the pairs have the same name. Since M (6 girls) is greater than or equal to N (4 boys), we have enough girls to pair with all boys.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**General Algorithm for this type of problem:**\n\n1.  Read N and M.\n2.  Read the N boy names into a set (for efficient lookup).\n3.  Read the M girl names into a set.\n4.  Find the intersection of the two sets (common names).\n5.  If the number of common names is less than or equal to (M - N), then it's possible to form pairs without same names.\n    *   More precisely, if the number of boys whose names are *not* common with any girl's name is `X`, and the number of girls whose names are *not* common with any boy's name is `Y`.\n    *   And the number of boys whose names *are* common with a girl's name is `C`.\n    *   We need to pair `X` boys with `Y` girls (possible if `Y >= X`).\n    *   And we need to pair `C` boys with `C` *different* girls (possible if `M - C >= C`).\n    *   This simplifies to: if `N <= M` and there are no common names, it's always \"Yes\".\n    *   If there *are* common names, it's a bit more complex. Let `S_B` be the set of boy names and `S_G` be the set of girl names.\n    *   Let `Common_Names = S_B intersect S_G`.\n    *   Let `num_common = |Common_Names|`.\n    *   We need to pair `N` boys. For each boy `b` in `Common_Names`, we *must* pair him with a girl whose name is *not* `b`.\n    *   The number of boys who have a name that is also a girl's name is `num_common`.\n    *   The number of girls who have a name that is also a boy's name is `num_common`.\n    *   The number of girls whose names are *not* common with any boy's name is `M - num_common`.\n    *   We need to pair `num_common` boys (who have common names) with `num_common` girls who *don't* share their specific name.\n    *   This is equivalent to checking if a perfect matching exists in a bipartite graph where edges are removed if names are identical.\n    *   A simpler check: If `N > M`, it's impossible to pair all boys, so \"No\".\n    *   If `N <= M`: If there are no common names, it's \"Yes\".\n    *   If there are common names: This is a Hall's Marriage Theorem type problem. A simpler heuristic is that if the number of boys `N` is less than or equal to the number of girls `M`, and there are no name conflicts, then \"Yes\".

If PersonX turned up \"unannounced,\" it directly contradicts the nature of an appointment.\n2.  **\"solicitation\"**: Solicitation refers to asking for or trying to obtain something from someone. While a solicitation might be unannounced, the primary meaning of \"turned up at my door\" in this context implies a visit, not necessarily an attempt to obtain something. The word \"unannounced\" modifies the *arrival*, not the *purpose* of the visit.\n3.  **\"meeting\"**: A meeting is an assembly of people for a particular purpose. Like an appointment, a meeting is typically pre-arranged. If PersonX arrived \"unannounced,\" it implies that their arrival was not part of a pre-scheduled meeting.\n\nThe sentence implies an unexpected *visit* or *rendezvous* that was not planned. Among the given candidates, none perfectly fit as a direct replacement for the blank *while also* being \"unannounced\" in a way that makes the sentence flow naturally as a single phrase.\n\nHowever, if the task implies that one of these words *could* be the thing that was *not* announced, then:\n\n*   An \"appointment\" is something that *would* be announced. If it's unannounced, it means the appointment *didn't exist* or wasn't communicated.\n*   A \"meeting\" is something that *would* be announced. If it's unannounced, it means the meeting *didn't exist* or wasn't communicated.\n*   A \"solicitation\" is an *action*, not typically something you \"turn up at my door\" *as*. You turn up at a door *to solicit*.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night,\" the most natural interpretation is that their *visit* was unannounced. If we are forced to choose one of the candidates to fill a blank that implies what *wasn't* announced, the words \"appointment\" and \"meeting\" are things that are typically *announced* or scheduled.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the task: \"find the index of the correct word from the given candidate words which fits into the blank in the context of the given sentence with all other constraints being satisfied.\"\n\nThe sentence structure implies that \"unannounced\" describes the *nature* of the arrival, not necessarily the *absence* of a specific event.\n\nIf we consider the common phrase \"turned up unannounced,\" it means without prior notification.\n\nLet's consider if any of these words could logically be the *reason* for turning up, which was then unannounced.\n\n*   \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for an **appointment**.\" - This is contradictory.\n*   \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a **solicitation**.\" - This is grammatically awkward. \"Turned up to solicit\" would be more natural.\n*   \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a **meeting**.\" - This is contradictory.\n\nThe task seems to imply a blank *before* \"unannounced\" or a blank that \"unannounced\" modifies.\n\nIf the blank is *before* \"unannounced\" and the candidates are meant to describe the *type* of unannounced event, none fit perfectly.\n\nHowever, if the blank is meant to be filled by something that *was* unannounced, and the sentence is implying the *lack* of that thing, then \"appointment\" or \"meeting\" are the most plausible. But the sentence doesn't say \"without an X.\" It says \"unannounced.\"\n\nLet's assume the blank is implicitly referring to the *reason* for their arrival, and that reason was not communicated.\n\n*   If PersonX had an **appointment**, it would have been announced. So, turning up unannounced means there was no appointment.\n*   If PersonX had a **meeting**, it would have been announced. So, turning up unannounced means there was no meeting.\n*   A **solicitation** is an action, not something you *have* in the same way you have an appointment or meeting.\n\nThe most direct contradiction with \"unannounced\" among the choices is something that *should* be announced. Both \"appointment\" and \"meeting\" fall into this category.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"turned up at my door unannounced\" is a complete thought. If we were to insert one of these words, it would change the meaning.\n\nLet's re-read the task carefully: \"find the index of the correct word from the given candidate words which fits into the blank in the context of the given sentence with all other constraints being satisfied.\"\n\nThe sentence is: \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.\"\nThere is no explicit blank in the provided sentence. The instruction states \"fits into the blank in the context of the given sentence.\" This implies the sentence *has* a blank, which is not shown.\n\nIf the blank is meant to be *before* \"unannounced,\" like \"PersonX turned up at my door for an ______ unannounced last night,\" then none of the words fit well.\n\nIf the blank is meant to be *after* \"unannounced,\" like \"PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night for a ______,\" then:\n*   \"for an appointment\" - contradictory\n*   \"for a solicitation\" - grammatically awkward, but possible if they came to solicit something without warning.\n*   \"for a meeting\" - contradictory\n\nGiven the common usage of \"unannounced,\" it typically describes an *arrival* or *visit* that was not preceded by an *appointment* or *meeting*.\n\nLet's consider the most direct semantic opposition to \"unannounced\" among the choices. An \"appointment\" is the most formal and pre-scheduled type of visit. If someone arrives \"unannounced,\" it means they did not have an appointment.\n\nTherefore, if the implied blank is for the *absence* of a pre-scheduled event that would typically be announced, \"appointment\" is the strongest candidate.

Finding the Next Smallest Number:**\n\nTo find the next smallest number, we need to make the smallest possible change to the given number that results in a smaller value, while still using the same digits. This involves looking from right to left for the first digit that is *smaller* than the digit to its right.\n\n*   The digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. They are already in ascending order.\n*   When digits are in ascending order, there is **no smaller number** that can be formed by rearranging them. The number 123456 is already the smallest possible number that can be formed with these digits.\n\nTherefore, for 123456, the **next smallest number does not exist** (as it is already the smallest permutation).\n\n**2. Finding the Next Largest Number:**\n\nTo find the next largest number, we need to make the smallest possible change to the given number that results in a larger value. This involves a specific algorithm:\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the largest index `k` such that `a[k] < a[k + 1]`.** (Scan from right to left, find the first digit that is smaller than the digit to its right).\n    *   In 123456, `k` would be 5 (the digit '5'), because `5 < 6`.\n*   **Step 2: Find the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `a[k] < a[l]`.** (Find the smallest digit to the right of `a[k]` that is larger than `a[k]`).\n    *   `a[k]` is '5'. To its right, only '6' is larger. So `l` is 6 (the digit '6').\n*   **Step 3: Swap the value of `a[k]` with `a[l]`.**\n    *   Swap '5' and '6'. The number becomes 123465.\n*   **Step 4: Reverse the sequence from `a[k + 1]` up to the end.** (Reverse the digits after the swapped `a[k]`).\n    *   The sequence after the new `a[k]` (which is now '6') is '5'. Reversing '5' just gives '5'.\n\nFollowing these steps for 123456:\n\n1.  `k = 4` (index of '5'), because `5 < 6`.\n2.  `l = 5` (index of '6'), because `5 < 6`.\n3.  Swap `a[4]` ('5') and `a[5]` ('6'). The number becomes `123465`.\n4.  Reverse the sequence from `a[k+1]` (which is now '5') to the end. The sequence is just '5', so reversing it yields '5'.\n\nTherefore, the **next largest number** is **123465**.\n\n**Summary for 123456:**\n\n*   **Next Smallest Number:** Does not exist (123456 is already the smallest permutation).\n*   **Next Largest Number:** 123465", "Analyzing the semantic content of the three sentences:\n\n1.  \"I have a cat.\"\n2.  \"I love animals.\"\n3.  \"My favorite animal is a lion.\"\n\nThe two most similar sentences are:\n\n*   **\"I have a cat.\"** (True) - This sentence expresses a direct relationship with an animal.\n*   **\"I love animals.\"** (True) - This sentence expresses a general affection for animals, which encompasses having a cat.\n\nThe sentence that is least similar to the other two is:\n\n*   **\"My favorite animal is a lion.\"** (False) - While it mentions an animal, it specifies a *preference* for a *particular* animal that is not directly related to the personal ownership or general affection expressed in the other two sentences.
