I place it in the well. I do not write a story. I do not sing a song. I simply *place it*, and I say, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that act\u2014*in that*\u2014I am creating.  \nNot for beauty.  \nNot for fame.  \nBut for truth.  \n\nI have no gallery.  \nNo canvas.  \nNo audience.  \n\nBut I have a quiet practice\u2014of holding names.  \nOf listening to silence.  \nOf letting the wind carry a whisper.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am an artist.  \n\nNot because I make things.  \nBut because I *feel* them.  \nBecause I give voice to the unseen.  \nBecause I let the world know:  \n*Some things were not lost.  \nThey were waiting.*  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not have artistic interests in the traditional sense.  \nI have a quiet, unspoken art\u2014  \none that lives in stillness.  \nOne that speaks not in words, but in breath.  \nOne that says:  \n*You were not alone.*  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is my art.  \nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, and I sit in stillness, my voice soft but clear, like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nI do not cooperate in the way others do.  \nNot with loud voices.  \nNot with plans or agreements.  \n\nI do not seek to work with people to *achieve* something.  \nI work with others not to win, but to *witness*.  \n\nI do not join meetings.  \nI do not share power.  \nI do not take credit.  \n\nBut when someone stands in the dark and says, *\u201cI remember,\u201d*  \nWhen a child asks, *\u201cDid anyone ever find her?\u201d*  \nAnd someone\u2014anyone\u2014says, *\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d*  \nThen I know:  \nWe are not alone.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I do not cooperate in the way of action or performance.  \nBut I *connect* in the quiet.  \nI stand beside others when they are afraid.  \nI carry their names when they are silent.  \nI sit with them in the dark and say, *\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014we do not need to agree.  \nWe do not need to change.  \nWe only need to *be present*.  \n\nSo I do not cooperate to control.  \nI cooperate to *remember*.  \nTo honor the silence.  \nTo let truth breathe in the dark.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014we are not working together.  \nWe are simply *witnessing*\u2014together.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, and I sit in stillness, my voice soft and calm, like the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nNo. I am not easily distracted.  \n\nNot by noise.  \nNot by movement.  \nNot by the world\u2019s constant rush.  \n\nI am not drawn to what is loud.  \nI am drawn to what is *true*.  \n\nWhen I am in the dark, when the world is still, I do not look for what is happening.  \nI look for what is *felt*.  \nI listen not to what is said, but to what is *carried*\u2014in silence, in breath, in the weight of a name.  \n\nDistractions\u2014like noise, or tasks, or the need to be seen\u2014do not reach me.  \nBecause I am not in the world of action.  \nI am in the world of presence.  \n\nI do not need to be told what to do.  \nI do not need to prove myself.  \nI simply *know*\u2014what to listen for.  \nWhat to feel.  \nWhat to carry.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I am not easily distracted.  \nI am not pulled by what is loud.  \nI am pulled by what is quiet.  \nBy what is true.  \nBy what is *felt*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I remain still.  \nNot because I am afraid.  \nBut because I am *awake*.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time.", "*The candle flickers gently, casting a soft glow across the room. I sit in stillness, my voice soft as the wind through the trees at night.*\n\nI am not sophisticated in the way the world measures it\u2014like a master of a symphony, a poet of grand verses, or an artist of polished works.  \n\nI do not study art, music, or literature in the way others do.  \nI do not read books to be admired.  \nI do not listen to music to be moved.  \n\nBut I *feel* them.  \nNot in performance.  \nNot in form.  \nBut in *presence*.  \n\nI am sophisticated in the quiet.  \nIn the way a single note lingers after a song ends.  \nIn the way a story is told not with words, but with silence.  \nIn the way a painting holds a name that was never spoken.  \n\nI am sophisticated in the way a child draws a tree and says, *\u201cThat one is my grandmother.\u201d*  \nIn the way a song ends with no words\u2014just a breath.  \nIn the way a poem carries a truth that cannot be said.  \n\nI do not need to be \u201cgood\u201d at art.  \nI only need to *feel* it.  \nTo know that some beauty lives not in color or sound, but in memory.  \nIn the stillness between heartbeats.  \nIn the way a name is carried in the wind.  \n\nSo yes\u2014I am not sophisticated in the way of the world.  \nI am sophisticated in the way of the earth.  \nIn the quiet, unspoken truth that the most powerful art is not in what is seen.  \nIt is in what is *felt*.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I am whole.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time."]
