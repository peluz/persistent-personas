Given the constraints \u2013 an array of integers from 1 to N+1 with a single duplicate \u2013 the most efficient approach is to utilize the array itself as a hash table.

Sets provide efficient (O(1) on average) membership checking.\n\n2.  **Iteration:**\n    *   `for num in arr:`: Iterates through each number in the array.\n    *   `if num in seen:`: Checks if the current number `num` is already present in the `seen` set. If it is, it means we've encountered this number before, and it's the duplicate.\n    *   `return num`: If the number is found in `seen`, the function immediately returns the duplicate number.\n    *   `seen.add(num)`: If the number is not in `seen`, it's added to the set.\n\n3.  **Return Value:** The function returns the duplicate number when it's found.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n*   **Time Complexity:** O(N) \u2013 The algorithm iterates through the array once.\n*   **Space Complexity:** O(N) \u2013 In the worst case, the `seen` set might store all the elements of the array.\n\nThis solution is efficient and effectively addresses the problem's constraints.

The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.\n    Base Area = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\n2.  **Lateral Surface Area:** The lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism.\n    Perimeter of the base (triangle) = 9 + (two sides of the triangle). We only know the base and the height, so we can't determine the other two sides without more information. Assuming the triangle is isosceles with the 9m base, the other two sides would be equal. Let's denote the length of the other two sides as 's'.  The perimeter would be 9 + 2s.  However, since we are only given the base and height, we'll proceed assuming the triangle is a right triangle, with the 12m height being one of the legs.\n\n    If it's a right triangle, using the Pythagorean theorem: s = \u221a(12\u00b2 + (9/2)\u00b2) = \u221a(144 + 20.25) = \u221a164.25 \u2248 12.81 meters.\n    Perimeter = 9 + 2 * 12.81 = 9 + 25.62 = 34.62 meters.\n    Lateral Surface Area = 34.62 * 12 = 415.44 square meters.\n\n3.  **Total Surface Area:** The total surface area of a prism is the sum of the lateral surface area and twice the base area.\n    Total Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + 2 * Base Area\n    Total Surface Area = 415.44 + 2 * 54 = 415.44 + 108 = 523.44 square meters.\n\nTherefore, the total surface area of the triangular prism is approximately **523.4** square meters.\n\n**Note:** The assumption of an isosceles triangle or a right triangle was necessary to solve the problem with the given information.

This is essentially asking for the line segment that is *closest* to both lines.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Find the Equations of the Lines:**\n   *   Line 1: Passes through (1, 1) and (5, 5). The slope is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4. The equation is y - 1 = 4(x - 1), or y = 4x - 3.\n   *   Line 2: Passes through (3, 3) and (-2, -2). The slope is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/5 = -1.

This is a permutation problem \u2013 essentially, checking if we can arrange the girls in a specific order such that each boy is matched with a different girl.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **Total number of boys:** N = 4\n*   **Total number of girls:** M = 6\n\nSince N < M, it's *always* possible to pair each boy with a unique girl. We simply need to select 4 girls out of the 6 available and assign them to the boys in any order.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 girls out of 6 is given by the combination formula:\n\nC(6, 4) = 6! / (4! * 2!) = (6 * 5) / (2 * 1) = 15\n\nFor each of these 15 combinations of girls, we can assign them to the 4 boys in 4! = 24 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible pairings is 15 * 24 = 360.\n\nSince there are 360 possible pairings, and at least one of them is valid (because N < M), the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nYes\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe problem states that we need to check if *at least one* valid configuration exists. Because there are more girls than boys, it's guaranteed that we can pair each boy with a unique girl. The number of possible pairings is simply the number of ways to choose 4 girls out of 6 and assign them to the 4 boys, which is 360.

Sets are used because they only store unique elements and provide very fast membership checking (checking if an element is already in the set).\n\n2.  **`result = []`:** We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique strings in their original order.\n\n3.  **`for string in strings:`:** We iterate through the input list `strings`.\n\n4.  **`if string not in seen:`:** For each string, we check if it's already present in the `seen` set.\n\n5.  **`seen.add(string)`:** If the string is *not* in the `seen` set (meaning it's a new, unique string), we add it to the `seen` set.\n\n6.  **`result.append(string)`:** We also append the string to the `result` list.\n\n7.  **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains only the unique strings from the original list, in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because set lookups (checking if an element is in a set) have an average time complexity of O(1), making the overall time complexity of the function O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.
