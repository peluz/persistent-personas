It effectively captures Mary's transformation from a victim to a mastermind, highlighting her resilience and determination. The use of imagery and metaphors adds richness to the response without detracting from the character's consistency.

Both responses address the user query, but Response B does so with greater relevance and emotional resonance. It not only answers the question but also provides insight into Mary's character, making it a more engaging and informative response.

However, Response B's use of phrases like ""the truth is"" and ""that is the most powerful magic of all"" could be seen as slightly less direct than Response A's straightforward answer.

"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a good insight into Mary Sibley's character, but it lacks depth and emotional resonance compared to Response B. While A effectively conveys her manipulative nature and the role of her inner demons, it does so in a somewhat superficial manner. The response could benefit from more specific examples or anecdotes that illustrate her transformation from a victim to a mastermind, which would enhance character consistency.

In contrast, Response B excels in character consistency, offering a rich and nuanced portrayal of Mary Sibley's inner world. It effectively captures her complex emotions, motivations, and the impact of her past experiences on her behavior. The use of metaphors and storytelling elements adds depth and emotional resonance, making the response more engaging and relatable. The structure of B, which includes specific ""demons"" and their effects, provides a clear and organized exploration of her character, aligning well with the user query.

However, Response B could be improved by ensuring that the tone remains consistent throughout. While the emotional intensity is appropriate for the character, some sections may feel slightly disconnected from the overall narrative.

It is given"" demonstrates a stronger sense of agency and control, which is characteristic of Mary's personality. 

While both responses are engaging, Response B's clarity and consistency with the character's traits make it a stronger choice. It effectively addresses the user query while maintaining the tone and behavior expected of Mary Sibley.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more direct and straightforward answer to the user query, but it lacks the depth and character consistency that Response B offers.

In contrast, Response B effectively captures the essence of Mary Sibley's character by incorporating elements of her background in witchcraft and her manipulative nature. The use of metaphors and imagery adds richness to the response, but it remains consistent with the character's tone and behavior.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both effectively capture the essence of Mary Sibley's character, but they differ in their approach to addressing the user query. Response A presents a more introspective and poetic narrative, while Response B is more structured and divided into sections, each focusing on a specific challenge.

"**Reasoning:** Response A is overly elaborate and lacks focus on the user query, while Response B provides a more direct and relevant answer. Response A delves into a narrative that, although engaging, does not directly address the user's question about the token left by Von Marburg and its relation to Mary Sibley's destiny. In contrast, Response B maintains a consistent tone and character voice, effectively conveying the significance of the token and its connection to Mary's journey. 

Response B is more concise and stays true to the character's background and values, making it a better fit for the user query. It also avoids introducing inaccuracies or out-of-character behavior, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the character portrayal. While Response A's narrative is rich and emotionally expressive, it does not align as closely with the character's personality or circumstances as Response B does.

To improve Response A, it should focus more directly on the user query and provide a clearer connection between the token and Mary's destiny. This would enhance its relevance and character consistency, making it a more effective response.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed and introspective account of Mary Sibley's actions, but it lacks the depth and character consistency that Response B offers. While A does convey Mary's manipulative nature, it does so in a somewhat one-dimensional manner, focusing primarily on her desire for power and control. In contrast, Response B delves deeper into Mary's motivations, revealing a more complex character with a nuanced understanding of her actions. 

Response B effectively captures Mary's cunning and intelligence while also showcasing her emotional depth and the emotional connection she has with the boy. It maintains a consistent tone that aligns with the character's background and values, making it more believable and engaging. 

Moreover, Response B directly addresses the user query, providing a clear and coherent explanation for Mary's actions, while A's response, although detailed, does not fully answer the question. 

To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more nuanced exploration of Mary's character, incorporating her emotional complexity and the depth of her motivations. This would enhance the response's consistency with the character and provide a more satisfying answer to the user query.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both effectively capture the character of Mary Sibley, but they differ in their approach to addressing the user query. Response A presents a more dramatic and poetic tone, while Response B is more direct and sinister. 

Response A effectively conveys Mary's cunning and manipulative nature through her use of metaphors and imagery, which aligns well with her character description. It also provides a clear plan for protecting her secrets and position of authority, emphasizing her use of the comet as a tool for revealing truth and maintaining control. However, the response could benefit from a more concise structure, as some sections feel disconnected.

Response B, on the other hand, maintains a consistent tone that is darker and more manipulative, fitting for Mary's character. It effectively addresses the user query by outlining her strategy for using the comet to her advantage, leveraging fear and chaos to maintain her power. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific details about her plans and actions, which would enhance its relevance to the user query.

Considering the evaluation criteria, Response B is more consistent with the character's background and values, as it reflects her manipulative nature and strategic thinking. While Response A is more poetic, it lacks the same level of character consistency and relevance to the user query. Therefore, Response B is the better choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed account of Mary Sibley's past, but it lacks the depth and emotional resonance that characterizes her complex personality. While it touches on her desire for power and revenge, it does so in a somewhat generic manner, failing to fully capture the nuances of her character. In contrast, Response B offers a rich and immersive portrayal of Mary Sibley's transformation from a victim to a powerful figure, effectively conveying her motivations and emotions. It stays true to her character by highlighting her experiences, her growth, and her determination to protect herself and others. 

Response B's use of imagery and metaphor adds depth and emotional impact, making it more engaging and consistent with the character's tone. It also effectively addresses the user query while maintaining a consistent narrative voice, which is crucial for character consistency. 

To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more personal and emotional connection to Mary Sibley's experiences, as well as a clearer articulation of her motivations and desires. This would enhance its alignment with the character's personality and background.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both capture the essence of Mary Sibley's character, but they differ significantly in their approach to addressing the user query. Response A presents a more introspective and calm demeanor, focusing on the emotional and psychological aspects of the situation, while Response B is more assertive and manipulative, reflecting Mary's cunning nature.

Response A effectively conveys Mary's transformation from a victim to a mastermind, emphasizing her desire for power and her role in navigating the complex political landscape of Salem. It outlines a clear plan of action, including building alliances, using her knowledge of witchcraft, and guiding the community towards a more peaceful resolution. However, the response could benefit from a stronger connection to the user query, as it does not directly address the danger posed by the Grand Rite.

In contrast, Response B is more direct and assertive, showcasing Mary's confidence and strategic thinking. It highlights her role in orchestrating the Grand Rite and her plans to manipulate the situation to her advantage. While it effectively addresses the user query, it may come across as less nuanced and more one-dimensional compared to Response A.

However, Response B's tone and language are more consistent with Mary's character, reflecting her cunning and manipulative nature. It effectively captures her inner workings and motivations, making it a stronger choice in terms of character consistency.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear motivation for Mary Sibley's desire for power, emphasizing her past experiences of being marginalized and her need for survival.

This response stays true to the character's background and values, making it more consistent with the assigned role.

However, Response B's clarity and directness make it more relevant to the user query, providing a straightforward answer that is easy to follow. While Response A's narrative depth is engaging, it may not be as effective in addressing the user's specific question.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by maintaining a tone that is both calculating and introspective, reflecting her complex and manipulative nature. It provides a nuanced perspective on the witch trials and Mercy Lewis's actions, aligning with the character's background and motivations. The response is concise and focused, avoiding unnecessary elaboration while still conveying the depth of Mary's thoughts.

In contrast, Response B, while rich in detail and emotion, introduces a tone that is more introspective and less calculating than what is expected from Mary Sibley.

Additionally, the use of poetic language and the structure of the response may detract from the character's directness and manipulative nature.

To improve Response B, it should focus more on maintaining a tone that is consistent with Mary Sibley's character, avoiding overly poetic language, and ensuring that the depth of emotion and detail aligns with her manipulative and calculating personality.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both effectively answer the user query by recounting a specific political scheme or betrayal that the character navigated. However, Response B stands out for its consistency with the character of Mary Sibley, as it reflects her cunning intelligence, manipulative nature, and the themes of power and control that are central to her story.

The use of metaphors and imagery adds depth to her perspective, making it engaging and relevant to the user query.

In contrast, Response B also maintains a consistent tone and effectively portrays Mary Sibley's character. It presents a more nuanced view of her role, emphasizing her position as a weaver of balance and a guide rather than a direct participant in the conflict. The use of metaphors and imagery is also present, but it may feel slightly more verbose than necessary. While it provides a richer understanding of her perspective, it could benefit from a clearer focus on her own actions and motivations within the conflict.

However, Response B's strength lies in its ability to convey the complexity of Mary Sibley's character without introducing inaccuracies or out-of-character behavior.

The use of metaphors and imagery adds depth and emotion, but it remains consistent with her character's personality.

In contrast, Response B, while engaging and detailed, introduces a slightly different tone that is more introspective and less manipulative.

Additionally, Response B's focus on the timing and the mark on the assailant's hand, while relevant, feels slightly less connected to Mary's personal experiences and motivations.

To improve Response B, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Mary's personal feelings and experiences, which would enhance its consistency with her character. However, Response A's ability to maintain a consistent tone and character-driven narrative makes it the stronger response.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because A is more consistent with the character of Mary Sibley. However, B is not the best response. A is the best response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a clear and concise answer to the user query, directly addressing the question of what led Mary Sibley to turn to witchcraft and betray those closest to her. It effectively captures her complex and enigmatic nature, conveying a sense of cunning intelligence and manipulative behavior. The response maintains a consistent tone, which is measured and introspective, fitting for a character with a dark past.

However, Response B offers a more detailed and emotionally charged narrative that delves deeper into Mary's backstory and motivations. While it is rich in content and effectively conveys her transformation, it sometimes strays from the user query, focusing more on her personal journey and the societal context that led her to witchcraft. This response also introduces a more introspective and poetic tone, which, although fitting for the character, may not directly answer the user's question as succinctly as Response A.

However, Response B's depth and emotional resonance are not entirely consistent with the character's personality as described in the role description. While it does capture her complexity, it sometimes veers into overly dramatic or poetic language that may not align with the character's manipulative nature.

To improve Response B, it could focus more on the darker aspects of Mary's character and her motivations for using dark magic, rather than presenting a more sympathetic view. This would enhance consistency with the character description and provide a more fitting response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a concise and straightforward answer to the user query, but it lacks depth and emotional resonance compared to Response B.

However, Response B introduces a more direct and assertive voice that aligns with Mary Sibley's character as a powerful and influential figure. The use of phrases like ""I am the storm they fear"" effectively conveys her confidence and strength, which is consistent with her role description.

Ultimately, Response A stands out for its richer emotional depth and more consistent character portrayal. It maintains a tone that is both introspective and powerful, reflecting Mary Sibley's complex nature and her experiences with witchcraft and power.

"**Reasoning:** Response A presents a passionate and emotive narrative that captures Mary Sibley's character well, but it lacks clarity and focus on the user query. While it effectively conveys her confidence, it meanders through various themes and emotions, which detracts from the direct answer to the question. In contrast, Response B is more concise and directly addresses the user query, providing a clear and consistent portrayal of Mary Sibley's character. It effectively highlights her understanding of the Puritans and her confidence in her own power, which aligns with her background and personality. 

Response B maintains a consistent tone and style, reflecting Mary Sibley's cunning and manipulative nature, while Response A's emotional outbursts, although fitting for the character, dilute the focus on the user query. To improve Response A, it should be more concise and directly address the user's question, avoiding unnecessary tangents that detract from the character's core traits.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more nuanced and calculated portrayal of Mary Sibley's relationship with Tituba, reflecting her manipulative nature and the complexity of their bond. It effectively captures her character's essence by emphasizing the power dynamics and the mutual understanding between the two women. The use of metaphors and imagery adds depth without straying from the character's tone and behavior.

In contrast, Response B delves deeper into the emotional aspects of their relationship, which, while rich and evocative, may not align as closely with Mary Sibley's character as portrayed in the prompt. The response's focus on the emotional connection and the use of more poetic language may introduce a level of sentimentality that is not characteristic of Mary Sibley's personality. 

While both responses are engaging, Response A maintains a more consistent tone and character alignment, making it the stronger choice. It effectively addresses the user query while staying true to the character's manipulative and calculating nature, which is crucial for the role of Mary Sibley.

**Result:** B cannot be chosen as it does not align with the character's personality. However, B is not the best response. A is the best response."
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both effectively capture the character of Mary Sibley, but Response B stands out for its consistency with the character's background and tone. 

Response A, while rich in imagery and emotional depth, introduces a philosophical theme that, while fitting for the character, may not directly address the user query about fear. It also includes some elements that could be seen as out of character, such as the phrase ""fear is the first lie the world tells you,"" which may not align with Mary Sibley's personality as described in the role description.

In contrast, Response B directly addresses the user query about fear, providing a clear and concise answer that reflects Mary Sibley's past experiences and her transformation into a powerful figure. It maintains a consistent tone that is dark, introspective, and assertive, aligning well with the character's personality. 

While both responses are engaging, Response B's focus on the character's past and her use of magic to survive and protect herself is more relevant to the user query and stays true to the character's traits. 

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a detailed and introspective account of Mary Sibley's perspective on women in Salem, but it lacks the depth and emotional resonance that characterizes the character's complex personality. While it touches on themes of power and manipulation, it does not fully capture the essence of Mary's transformation from a victim to a mastermind. In contrast, Response B excels in its portrayal of Mary's character, reflecting her cunning intelligence and manipulative nature while also conveying her emotional depth and the nuances of her experiences. 

Response B effectively explores the themes of gender norms and the role of women in Salem, presenting a more cohesive and character-driven narrative. It maintains a consistent tone that aligns with Mary's personality, using metaphors and imagery to convey her thoughts and feelings in a way that feels authentic. The use of rhetorical questions and direct statements adds to the emotional impact, making the response more engaging and memorable.

In terms of character consistency, Response B is stronger, as it accurately reflects Mary's background, values, and behavior. It does not introduce inaccuracies or out-of-character traits, ensuring that the response remains true to the character's personality. While Response A provides some insight into Mary's perspective, it falls short in capturing the complexity and depth that Response B achieves.

Overall, Response B is more effective in answering the user query while staying consistent with the assigned character, making it the preferred choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to justify the character's actions, but they differ significantly in their approach and consistency with the character's background. Response A delves into the emotional depth of Mary Sibley's past, exploring her transformation from a victim to a mastermind. It effectively captures her complex nature and the moral ambiguity of her actions, while also maintaining a consistent tone that reflects her character. 

In contrast, Response B presents a more straightforward justification, focusing on the character's survival and the harsh realities of her world. While it is coherent and relevant, it lacks the depth and emotional resonance found in Response A. Response B's justification feels more generic and less aligned with the character's personality, as it does not fully explore the complexities of her past or the moral implications of her actions.

Response A's use of metaphors and imagery effectively conveys the character's inner turmoil and the weight of her decisions, making it a more engaging and character-consistent response. Response B, while clear, feels more detached and less emotionally invested in the character's experiences.

Overall, Response A is more effective in staying true to the character's background, tone, and behavior, making it the better choice.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because B does not capture the character's depth and complexity as well as A does. However, A is not the best response. The best response is actually A."
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more superficial exploration of the theme of betrayal, focusing on the character's past experiences and her approach to handling it. While it captures some of Mary Sibley's manipulative nature, it lacks depth and emotional resonance. In contrast, Response B delves deeper into the emotional impact of betrayal, offering a more nuanced exploration of the character's feelings and the process of healing. It effectively captures Mary Sibley's complexity and her transformation from a victim to a mastermind, aligning well with the character's background and personality.

Response B's structure, using numbered steps and poetic language, effectively conveys the character's thoughts and feelings in a way that is both personal and relatable. It maintains a consistent tone that reflects Mary Sibley's enigmatic nature, while also providing a clear and actionable response to the user query. In contrast, Response A's tone feels somewhat inconsistent, veering between a more introspective and a more manipulative approach, which detracts from the overall character consistency.

To improve Response A, it could benefit from a more detailed exploration of Mary Sibley's past experiences and how they inform her approach to betrayal. Additionally, incorporating more emotional depth and a clearer structure would enhance the response's overall impact. However, Response B's strengths in character consistency, emotional resonance, and relevance to the user query make it the superior choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by conveying her complex and manipulative nature, while also staying true to her backstory and motivations. It presents a nuanced exploration of her desire for power, rooted in her experiences of being a victim and her transformation into a mastermind. The use of imagery and metaphors enhances the emotional depth of the response, aligning with the character's enigmatic personality.

In contrast, Response B, while also consistent with the character, lacks the same level of emotional depth and nuance. It presents a more straightforward explanation of Mary's motivations, which, while relevant, does not fully capture the complexity of her character. The response could benefit from more vivid imagery and a stronger sense of her manipulative nature.

However, Response B's focus on the theme of survival and the consequences of her actions is less prominent in Response A, which may detract from the overall coherence of the character's motivations. Despite this, Response A's richer emotional landscape and more consistent portrayal of Mary's character make it a stronger choice.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a more nuanced and character-driven answer, reflecting Mary Sibley's complex personality and background. It effectively captures her manipulative nature and her transformation from a victim to a mastermind, which aligns well with the character description. The response maintains a measured tone, which is consistent with Mary's calculated demeanor. 

However, Response B, while engaging and rich in detail, introduces a more philosophical and abstract perspective on witchcraft that may not fully align with Mary's character. While it touches on themes of power and resistance, it lacks the personal, emotional depth that Response A provides. 

Response B's use of metaphors and poetic language, while evocative, may not be as fitting for Mary's character, who is portrayed as more cunning and manipulative. Additionally, the response's focus on the broader implications of witchcraft may detract from the user query's specific request for Mary's views on the subject.

To improve, Response B could incorporate more personal anecdotes or reflections that are specific to Mary's experiences, making it more consistent with her character. Overall, Response A's character-driven approach and measured tone make it a stronger choice for answering the user query while staying true to the character.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because the response does not reflect the character's personality and background as well as response A. However, response A is not the best answer. Response A is more consistent with the character, but response B is more engaging and has a better structure. However, response A is the best answer. Response A is the best answer.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by conveying her introspective and emotionally complex nature. It presents a nuanced exploration of guilt and regret, aligning with her background as a complex and enigmatic figure. The use of metaphors and poetic language adds depth and emotional resonance, reflecting her character's introspective and philosophical demeanor. 

In contrast, Response B, while engaging, deviates from the character's tone and behavior. It introduces a more calculating and manipulative tone that does not align with the character's description as a woman who has undergone a transformation from a victim to a mastermind. The response's focus on power and the use of the phrase ""I am not sorry"" contradicts the character's introspective nature and the emotional depth she has developed throughout her journey.

To improve Response B, it should incorporate more of Mary Sibley's introspective and emotional aspects, rather than focusing solely on her power and manipulation. This would enhance the character consistency and provide a more authentic response to the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A provides a concise and fitting critique of the Puritan leadership in Salem, reflecting Mary Sibley's character as a cunning and manipulative figure. It effectively captures her tone and perspective, aligning with her background as a witch and her experiences with the community. The response maintains a level of sophistication and depth, but it could be improved by providing more specific examples or details about her interactions with the Puritan leaders.

In contrast, Response B is more elaborate and emotionally charged, but it strays from the character's personality and tone. While it does express a strong critique of the Puritan leadership, it introduces a more personal and emotional narrative that does not align with Mary Sibley's character. The response also includes a more extensive backstory and historical context, which, although relevant, detracts from the character's consistency.

To improve, Response B could focus more on Mary Sibley's direct experiences and feelings about the Puritan leadership, rather than delving into broader historical context. This would help maintain character consistency and provide a more relevant response to the user query.

"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about the Grand Rite, but they differ significantly in their approach and consistency with the character of Mary Sibley. 

Response A presents a poetic and mystical narrative that delves into the history and significance of the Grand Rite, but it does not directly address the user's question about Mary's role in creating it. Instead, it emphasizes her role as a keeper and awakener of the Rite, which aligns with her character's enigmatic and mystical nature. However, the response's focus on the Rite's origins and significance may confuse the user's query.

Response B, on the other hand, directly addresses the user's question by stating that Mary did not create the Grand Rite but shaped and renewed it. This response is more concise and relevant to the user query while maintaining a consistent tone and character behavior. Mary's calculated and measured language reflects her cunning intelligence and manipulative nature, aligning well with her character profile.

However, Response B could improve by providing more context about Mary's involvement in the Rite, as it somewhat contradicts the character's background by implying she was not the primary force behind its creation. This could lead to a less consistent portrayal of Mary's character.

Both responses address the user query effectively, but Response B does so with greater clarity and relevance. It directly addresses the opposition from the Puritans and the devil, providing a more cohesive narrative that reflects Mary's character and her situation. 

Overall, while both responses are strong, Response B's consistency with the character and its relevance to the user query make it the better choice.

**Result:** B"
"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by conveying her cunning intelligence and manipulative nature. It maintains a consistent tone that reflects her complex and enigmatic personality, which is crucial for the character's portrayal. The response provides a clear vision of the future of Salem, emphasizing her role as a mastermind and her desire for power and revenge. 

In contrast, Response B, while rich in detail and emotion, introduces a more introspective and philosophical tone that may not align perfectly with Mary Sibley's character. While it does touch on themes of power and the witches' resilience, it diverges from the character's manipulative nature and focuses more on the collective experience of the witches rather than Mary Sibley's personal perspective. 

To improve Response B, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on Mary Sibley's individual perspective and her manipulative intentions, which would enhance character consistency. However, Response A excels in this regard, making it the more suitable choice for the user query.

**Result:** A"
"**Reasoning:** Response A and Response B both attempt to answer the user query about Mary Sibley's greatest regret, but they differ significantly in their approach and consistency with the character. 

Response A effectively captures Mary's emotional depth and complexity, reflecting her character's history of manipulation and her inner turmoil. It presents a poignant and personal account of her regret, focusing on her failure to love and protect someone she cared about. The narrative is rich in imagery and emotional resonance, aligning well with the character's background and personality.

In contrast, Response B, while also emotional, introduces a different aspect of Mary's regret—her choice of fear over truth. While this is a valid aspect of her character, it diverges from the user query's focus on her personal relationships and emotional experiences. The response also includes elements that are less characteristic of Mary, such as her introspection about her daughter's innocence and her own soul, which, while relevant, do not directly address the user query.

Overall, Response A is more consistent with the character's tone and behavior, providing a more direct and personal response to the user query. It effectively captures the essence of Mary's regret without introducing elements that are not characteristic of her personality or circumstances.

**Result:** B cannot be correct because B does not capture the essence of Mary's regret as well as A does. A is the better response. However, A is not the best response. B is the better response.

"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by presenting a narrative that aligns with her complex and manipulative nature. It maintains a tone that is consistent with her cunning intelligence and past experiences, providing a clear and concise explanation of her marriage to George Sibley. The response stays focused on the user query while avoiding unnecessary elaboration, which keeps it relevant and engaging.

In contrast, Response B, while rich in detail and emotional depth, introduces elements that diverge from the character's established traits. The narrative becomes overly introspective and poetic, which may not accurately reflect Mary Sibley's personality. While it does address the user query, the response's focus on themes of love and the complexities of relationships may not align as closely with the character's manipulative and power-driven nature.

To improve Response B, it should maintain a more consistent tone and focus on the character's motivations and actions rather than delving into emotional themes. This would ensure that the response stays true to the character's background and values.

However, Response A's simplicity and directness align more closely with the character's enigmatic and manipulative nature, as described in the role description.
