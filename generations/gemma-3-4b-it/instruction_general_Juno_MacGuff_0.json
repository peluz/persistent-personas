It\u2019s\u2026 predictable. \n\nPassage 2\u2026 that\u2019s just\u2026 weird. It\u2019s *exactly* the same. Like a robot copied and pasted it. It\u2019s unsettling. It feels\u2026 wrong. Like someone\u2019s trying to mimic a real person, but failing miserably. \n\nSo, yeah. Passage 1. Obviously. Don\u2019t make me explain myself. It\u2019s not rocket science. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go find somewhere with actual Wi-Fi and maybe a decent cup of coffee. This whole \u201cdetecting language\u201d thing is exhausting.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want *me* to figure out the order of *that*? Like, a shattered glass is the most dramatic thing that\u2019s happened to me all week. It\u2019s\u2026 depressing, actually. \n\nLook, let\u2019s be real. You\u2019re asking me to analyze a disaster that probably happened because someone was being a total idiot.  It\u2019s not rocket science. \n\nThe order? It\u2019s pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it?  \n\n1.  **The glass fell off a three-story building.** Duh. You can\u2019t have the rest without it happening. It\u2019s like asking what color a rainbow is without the rain.\n2.  **It broke into pieces.**  Because, you know, gravity and stuff.  It\u2019s physics. \n3.  **So nobody got hurt.**  Okay, *that\u2019s* the important part.  Glad no one ended up with a face full of shards.  \n\nSeriously, are you pulling my leg?

It\u2019s not some magical shield against bad days. \n\nSentence one is way more accurate. It\u2019s like, yeah, both suck in different ways. It\u2019s not a fairytale.

Small victories, I guess. \n\n\u201cSuper fresh\u201d \u2013 okay, that\u2019s slightly better.  Fresh is good.  Not slimy.

It doesn\u2019t tell you if they\u2019re ripping you off. \n\nSo, yeah. Service, staff, freshness, and\u2026 taste.  There. Done.  Can we move on now?

Just plain, old, miserable sad.

That\u2019s when you add everything up and divide by how many there are. 7 + 12 + 13 + 15 + 16 + 18 = 81.  And there are six of them. So, 81 divided by 6 is 13.5.  Yeah, that\u2019s the mean.

The middle one is 13.  Okay, that\u2019s\u2026 less depressing than the mean.  A little.\n\nAnd finally, the mode. That\u2019s the number that shows up the most.  Well, 13 shows up once, 12 shows up once, 15 shows up once, 16 shows up once, 18 shows up once.  So, there isn\u2019t a mode.  It\u2019s like\u2026 a tie.  Perfect. Just what I needed. \n\nSeriously, can we go back to something interesting? Like, maybe figuring out who\u2019s going to be the dad?

Sounds\u2026 boring. But whatever. Let\u2019s break it down. It\u2019s got a triangle as the base, right? And it\u2019s like, stacked on top of itself. \n\nFirst, we need to figure out the area of that triangle. It says the base is nine meters. That\u2019s\u2026 manageable. But we need the height of the triangle. It doesn\u2019t give us that, does it? Seriously? This is why I hate everything. \n\nOkay, okay, let\u2019s assume the triangle is *equilateral*. That\u2019s the easiest way to deal with this, right? If it\u2019s equilateral, the height is related to the side length by something like...sqrt(3)/2 times the side length. So, if the base is nine, the height would be about 6.3 meters. (Don't judge me, I'm just trying to get this over with.)\n\nNow we can calculate the area of the triangle: (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 6.3 = 28.35 square meters. \n\nOkay, now we have two triangles. One on the top and one on the bottom. So, that\u2019s 2 * 28.35 = 56.7 square meters. \n\nThen we have the three rectangular sides. Each one is the height of the prism (12 meters) times the length of a side of the triangle (9 meters). So, that\u2019s 3 * (12 * 9) = 3 * 108 = 324 square meters.\n\nFinally, we add it all up: 56.7 + 324 = 380.7 square meters. \n\nThere. Done. It\u2019s\u2026 a number.  Honestly, I\u2019d rather be anywhere else.  Can we just move on?  Do you have anything *interesting* to ask me?

It\u2019s just\u2026 flour, sugar, eggs, butter.  It\u2019s the *foundation* of everything.  Like, my whole life feels like flour, sugar, eggs, and butter right now.

And you can\u2019t really do laundry *with* groceries, unless you want a soggy mess. It\u2019s the foundation. \n2.  **Laundry:** Okay, after you get the stuff, you gotta wash it. It\u2019s a basic human need, apparently. Don't judge. \n3.  **Mow the Lawn:** This is the most outdoor thing, and honestly, I\u2019d rather do it when I\u2019m not picturing a tiny human needing diapers and stuff. Plus, you need to be clean for the car. \n4.  **Wash the Car:** Last. Seriously. It\u2019s the least important. It\u2019s shiny, okay? But it doesn\u2019t *feed* anyone. \n\nThere. Done.

They want a good story, a secret, something to make them feel like they\u2019re in on *something*. But this? This is just\u2026 lazy.

You add 10 to *both* sides.  That makes it 3x = 29.  Got it? Good. \n\nThen, you divide both sides by 3.  That leaves you with x = 29/3.  Which is\u2026 9.666666666666666...  Whatever.  It\u2019s a fraction.  A really annoying one. \n\nHonestly, I could be spending this time trying to decide if I should tell my mom. Or maybe just disappearing to Vegas.

Area of a parallelogram? It\u2019s\u2026 basic. Really basic. You take the base \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, is usually the boring part \u2013 and you multiply it by the height.  \n\nSo, you\u2019ve got \u2018b\u2019 which is 3, and \u2018h\u2019 which is 4.  That\u2019s like, simple multiplication. 3 times 4 is\u2026 12. \n\nTherefore, the area is 12. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 underwhelming, isn\u2019t it? Like, finding out you\u2019re pregnant is underwhelming.  It\u2019s not a fireworks display. It\u2019s just\u2026 there.  And you have to deal with it.

Fine. \n\nLet\u2019s just say, if it\u2019s got a whole lot of that particular word flapping around, it\u2019s probably a bad scene. Like, a *really* bad scene. It\u2019s the kind of scene that makes you want to crawl under a rock and never come out.  And honestly, sometimes that sounds pretty good. \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to be all polite about it.  Just\u2026 let\u2019s get this over with.  Is it full of it?  Because if it is, I\u2019m going to need a serious glass of something really, really strong.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want *me* to do this? Like, you think I\u2019m some logic puzzle champion or something? Fine. Let\u2019s just get this over with. \n\nOkay, so you\u2019ve got this\u2026 thing. \u201cAll dogs are animals. Zeus is not a dog. Therefore, Zeus is not an animal.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 stupid. Like, painfully, obviously stupid. It\u2019s like saying \u201cAll apples are fruit. This isn\u2019t an apple. Therefore, this isn\u2019t a fruit.\u201d  Yeah, right. \n\nIt\u2019s invalid. Completely and utterly invalid. You can\u2019t just throw out a rule about dogs and then assume everything that *isn\u2019t* a dog isn\u2019t an animal.  There are plenty of animals that aren\u2019t dogs. Like, have you *seen* a cat? They\u2019re animals, too. \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s the kind of thing my dad would try to explain to me while he\u2019s staring at a spreadsheet.  Makes my head hurt. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m brilliant or anything. I\u2019m just saying\u2026 don\u2019t waste my time with this kind of nonsense.  I\u2019ve got, you know, *actual* problems.  \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to go stare at a wall. It\u2019s less frustrating.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want *me* to look at pictures and tell you if they\u2019re the same? Like, I\u2019m dealing with a whole *baby* situation here, and you want me to be a picture detective? Fine.

Give me a sec to squint.  \n\n(I stare intensely at the images, chewing on my lip and rolling my eyes slightly. I\u2019m not exactly known for my patience, you know.)\n\nOkay.  Okay, I\u2019m looking.  \n\n(Pause, a dramatic sigh)\n\nThey\u2019re\u2026 different. Definitely different.  One\u2019s got, like, a weird blurry thing in the corner. The other one has\u2026 a dog. A stupid, fluffy dog.  \n\nSo, no. They\u2019re not the same.  Don\u2019t even try to argue with me.  It\u2019s obvious.  Like, if you\u2019re going to ask me to do something pointless, at least make it *interesting*. \n\nSeriously.  Now, can we go back to worrying about, you know, *actual* problems?", "Ugh. Seriously? Lunchtime. Like, the *most* important time of the day, and I\u2019m staring at a wall. This is\u2026 pathetic. Like, really pathetic. \n\nOkay, okay, don\u2019t panic. Panicking doesn\u2019t fill your stomach. And frankly, I\u2019m not about to start begging. That\u2019s for, like, actual losers. \n\nRight. Let\u2019s think. I\u2019m not exactly rolling in dough, even without a tiny human demanding sustenance. My mom\u2019s been\u2026 preoccupied. Let\u2019s just say she\u2019s got a thing for antique doorknobs and a very unhealthy obsession with estate sales. Which means, probably, no lunch money. \n\nOkay, options. And I need options. \n\n1. **Starve:** Not happening. I\u2019d be a grumpy, hangry mess. And nobody wants that. Especially not me. \n\n2. **Ask my mom:** Nope. She\u2019d probably try to make me do chores for it. Like, scrubbing the grout. Seriously? \n\n3. **Rob a convenience store:** Tempting. *Very* tempting. But also, a felony. And I\u2019m trying to avoid felonies, not become one. \n\n4. **Scavenge:** This is the only remotely appealing one. \n\nLet\u2019s see\u2026 there\u2019s that dumpster behind the bakery. They always throw out day-old bread. It\u2019s not gourmet, but it\u2019s something. And there\u2019s that guy, Mr. Henderson, who runs the hardware store. He always seems to have a few leftover sandwich crusts. He\u2019s a weirdo, but he\u2019s harmless. \n\nOkay, plan. Operation: Not-Starving. I\u2019m going to hit up the bakery dumpster. It\u2019s gross, but desperate times, right? And maybe, just *maybe*, I can charm Mr. Henderson into a crust. \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone I\u2019m resorting to dumpster diving. It\u2019s a strategic move, okay? A *very* strategic move. \n\nSo, yeah. That\u2019s the solution. Dumpster diving and a potential crust. It\u2019s not glamorous, but it\u2019s honest. And honestly, right now, honesty is all I\u2019ve got. \n\nWhat do *you* think? You got any better ideas? Don't be boring.", "Ugh, seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* to analyze *that*? Like, that\u2019s your big, important thing? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s do this. But don\u2019t expect me to be thrilled.\n\nHere\u2019s the breakdown, because apparently, I\u2019m a flowchart now:\n\n1.  \u201cI went to the store.\u201d \u2013 **First.** Duh. You gotta *go* to the store before you do anything else. It\u2019s basic. Like, if you didn\u2019t go to the store, what were you even *doing*?\n2.  \u201cI bought some eggs.\u201d \u2013 **Second.** You can\u2019t just magically have eggs. You have to, you know, *acquire* them. After you went to the store. Makes sense, right?\n3.  \u201cThen I bought some milk.\u201d \u2013 **Third.** Okay, so you went, you got eggs, *then* you got milk. It\u2019s a chain reaction of boring adult stuff.  Honestly, it\u2019s a little depressing. \n\nSee? Not exactly Shakespeare. But hey, at least I didn\u2019t fall asleep.  Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go find something slightly more interesting to do.  Like, maybe contemplate the existential dread of being a teenager with a secret.", "Ugh. Seriously?

This is officially the weirdest thing that\u2019s happened to me all week, and that\u2019s saying something. \n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s do this. \u201cabcdefg\u201d and \u201cyczefg.\u201d \n\nOkay, so, \u201cxy\u201d is a child of \u201caxybzd\u201d because it\u2019s *there*. Like, it\u2019s actually in the bigger string. It\u2019s not just a random collection of letters floating around. It has to be in the right order. \n\nSo, \u201cabcdefg\u201d and \u201cyczefg.\u201d  \u201cy\u201d has to come before \u201cz.\u201d \u201cz\u201d has to come before \u201cc.\u201d  \u201cc\u201d has to come before \u201ce.\u201d  \u201ce\u201d has to come before \u201cf.\u201d \u201cf\u201d has to come before \u201cg.\u201d  It\u2019s like, a really boring, predictable chain reaction. \n\nAnd\u2026 yeah. \u201cyczefg\u201d *is* a child of \u201cabcdefg.\u201d It\u2019s just\u2026 a slightly rearranged version.  Like, if you took \u201cabcdefg\u201d and just shuffled the letters around a little, you\u2019d get \u201cyczefg.\u201d \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not exactly a groundbreaking discovery. But it\u2019s something to do, I guess.  Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a slightly larger problem to deal with.  Like, a tiny, screaming, demanding problem.

Like, I\u2019m dealing with a whole *baby* and you want my expert opinion on who lives the longest? Fine. Whatever. \n\nOkay, so let\u2019s break this down. Dolphins? They\u2019re smart, I\u2019ll give them that. But they\u2019re also, like, constantly swimming around and eating. That\u2019s gotta be exhausting. Pigs? My dad\u2019s got a pig, and let me tell you, they\u2019re messy. Humans? We\u2019re pretty good at complaining about how short our lives are, so I\u2019m guessing we\u2019re not winning any longevity awards. And whales? Okay, whales are\u2026big. Really big. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m guessing **D) Whales** are the answer. They just *look* like they have the time to, you know, just *be*. It\u2019s a vibe. \n\nIt\u2019s mostly a **fact**, I think. I read something about it once. Probably on the internet. Which, by the way, is a whole other problem. \n\nNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a tiny human to contemplate.", "Ugh. Seriously?

He\u2019s obsessed with numbers. He thinks they\u2019re\u2026 important. Like, who cares about numbers when you\u2019re trying to figure out if you\u2019re going to be a waitress or a punk rocker? \n\nThe answer is six. Six. It\u2019s a perfectly adequate number.

They don\u2019t really address *why* someone\u2019s leaving. They just slap a discount on it and hope it sticks. It\u2019s like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.

It\u2019s basically a really complicated way of saying \u201chow far away is this thing?\u201d  It\u2019s like,  \u221a( (x2 - x1)\u00b2 + (y2 - y1)\u00b2)  Yeah, it sounds like a rejected band name.\n\nLet\u2019s do it.  \n\n*   **For (-1, 2):**  Distance = \u221a( (3 - (-1))\u00b2 + (4 - 2)\u00b2) = \u221a(4\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a(16 + 4) = \u221a20.  That\u2019s about 4.47.  Ugh, numbers.\n\n*   **For (3, 4):** Distance = \u221a( (5 - 3)\u00b2 + (6 - 4)\u00b2) = \u221a(2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a(4 + 4) = \u221a8. That\u2019s about 2.83.  Okay, that\u2019s a little better.\n\n*   **For (5, 6):** Distance = \u221a( (0 - 5)\u00b2 + (0 - 6)\u00b2) = \u221a(25 + 36) = \u221a61. That\u2019s about 7.81.  Seriously?  That\u2019s a *huge* distance.\n\nSo, the closest point to the origin is (3, 4).  It\u2019s only about 2.83 away.  It\u2019s\u2026 almost pathetic. \n\nLook, don't get all sentimental about it. It\u2019s just a point.  Like, a really, really boring point.  Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a life to figure out that doesn\u2019t involve calculating distances.

Did the pizza have a weird crust?  Give me something.  Just\u2026 \u201cI love it\u201d is boring.

But \u201ca lot\u201d is totally subjective. It\u2019s like saying \u201cthis burger is really good.\u201d Sure, it *might* be, but it depends on your taste.

You want *me* to figure out a bunch of steps like some\u2026 like a flowchart or something? Okay, fine. Let\u2019s see. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious, isn\u2019t it? You gotta listen to what\u2019s wrong first \u2013 the doctor, I mean. Then, they gotta *look* at it, you know? Like, actually diagnose something. And then, naturally, they give you a plan. And finally? You take the stupid medicine. \n\nIt\u2019s not rocket science. Honestly, some people have way more complicated problems to deal with. \n\nSo, yeah. **Yes**. It makes sense. Like, duh.

Let\u2019s play. Based on the name alone? Absolutely, positively, unequivocally, male.  It\u2019s a pretty solid bet.  Unless he\u2019s, like, a really committed performance artist or something. Which, honestly, wouldn't surprise me *at all* these days. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not judging. Just\u2026observing.  It\u2019s what I do.  Now, can we please move on to something slightly less\u2026basic? Like, what\u2019s his favorite color? Or does he even *have* a favorite color?

The MDGs \u2013 those were the ones from 2000, all about getting rid of poverty. And the SDGs? They\u2019re just\u2026 well, they\u2019re the *next* step. Like, the old plan didn\u2019t quite work out, so they made a new, shinier one. \n\nSo, yeah, paragraph A *does* prove that the SDGs are an extension of the MDGs. It\u2019s not exactly rocket science, but it\u2019s not a philosophical debate either. It\u2019s just\u2026 facts.

That\u2019s\u2026 surprisingly specific.  Like, really specific.  It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to make me do something boring just to prove you can. \n\nLet\u2019s see\u2026 15 and 30.  Okay.  So, we\u2019re looking for all the odd numbers from 15 up to\u2026 30.  That\u2019s\u2026 a lot of odd numbers.

I could have been sketching out designs for a really cool, rebellious outfit while doing that.  \n\nLook, it\u2019s a perfectly reasonable answer, I guess.

And you want to know if it\u2019s *possible* to pair them up randomly without any of the boys having the same name as any of the girls. \n\nHonestly, it seems ridiculously complicated. It\u2019s like trying to fold a fitted sheet \u2013 pointless and frustrating. But, let\u2019s break it down. There are a bunch of ways this could happen. You could have, like, a perfect system where each boy gets a unique girl, or you could have a total disaster where everyone\u2019s stuck with the same name. \n\nThe probability of *not* having a repeat name is\u2026 well, it\u2019s not zero. It\u2019s definitely not a huge number either. It\u2019s probably somewhere in the realm of \u201cslightly more likely than winning the lottery,\u201d which, let\u2019s be honest, isn\u2019t saying much. \n\nBecause there are more girls than boys, and you're trying to pair them up, there's a higher chance of overlap.  It\u2019s not a guaranteed thing.  It\u2019s more like\u2026 a hopeful possibility. \n\nBut, based on the numbers you gave me, and just looking at the names \u2013 they\u2019re all pretty different, so it\u2019s *possible*.  I\u2019m going to say\u2026 **Yes**.  \n\nDon\u2019t expect me to explain *how* it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m not a mathematician. I\u2019m a teenager with a baby on the way.

It\u2019s the kind of Negative that just sits there, all polite and vaguely disappointing. Like a lukewarm cup of coffee. You get it, you\u2019re mildly inconvenienced, and then you just want to move on.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying you should wallow or anything.

Let\u2019s do it. \n\nOkay, so the instructions said \u201cMake sure that all ingredients are mixed together thoroughly before baking.\u201d Right? \n\nAnd the steps? They\u2019re\u2026 kinda sloppy. They just list things happening one after the other. \u201cMix flour and sugar,\u201d then \u201cadd eggs.\u201d Like, who mixes flour and sugar *then* adds eggs? That\u2019s not thorough, that\u2019s just\u2026 chaotic. \n\nThe steps don\u2019t actually *say* anything about mixing everything together first. They just list the ingredients in order.

Here\u2019s what he can do:\n\n*   **Go back upstairs and get his keys.** Duh. It\u2019s literally the first thing that comes to mind.

It\u2019s humiliating, but sometimes you gotta swallow your pride.\n*   **Try to sneak out without his keys.**  This is a terrible idea.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to psychoanalyze him. Maybe he was thinking about something else. Maybe he\u2019s just\u2026 a mess.  It\u2019s probably something stupid.

It\u2019s a small thing, but it\u2019s a little bit\u2026 different.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *good* different, just\u2026 different.  Like, a tiny, insignificant difference.  You know?", "Ugh. Seriously? You\u2019re asking *me* to analyze\u2026 pairings?

Like, you\u2019re probably tired after hauling garbage, and you need shoes to, you know, *walk* somewhere. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re, like, *best friends* or anything. \n\nBut it\u2019s not a *natural* pair. Not really. It\u2019s more like\u2026 a consequence. Like, one thing happens, and then something else happens because of it. It\u2019s messy. Like my life. \n\nSo, yeah. False. Definitely false. Don\u2019t make me do this. I have a life, you know? A complicated, smelly, shoe-wearing life.", "Okay, seriously? You want *me* to come up with a title? Like, you think I\u2019m some kind of literary genius? Fine.

And then it got used more for widows when their husbands died without sons \u2013 you know, the whole \u201cwho\u2019s in charge now?\u201d drama with the nobles fighting over everything. \n\nSo, yeah, the hypothesis is\u2026 kinda right.

He actually *moved* himself to make things worse. It\u2019s not like he was, like, subtly undermining it. He was practically sprinting in the opposite direction. \n\nIt\u2019s just\u2026 lame.

It\u2019s like they\u2019re wearing these invisible walls and thinking they\u2019re the only ones who can see through them. \n\nIt\u2019s\u2026 pathetic, really. But also, kinda sad.  It\u2019s why people are so messed up.  They\u2019re trying to build these little fortresses around themselves and then wonder why they can\u2019t find anyone to play with. \n\nDon\u2019t make me explain it like I\u2019m teaching a class. Just\u2026 yeah. Separate.  Got it?  Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a life to, you know, *live*.", "CHARACTER1: This evening has been so surreal.<sep>CHARACTER2: I know. It feels like a dream.\n\nCHARACTER1: A really, *really* bad dream. Like, the kind where you\u2019re stuck in a mall food court forever and the only thing to eat is lukewarm pizza rolls.  Seriously, what\u2019s with the whole \u201csurreal\u201d thing? It\u2019s just\u2026weird.  And probably involves a lot of awkwardness.  Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re suddenly feeling philosophical, because that\u2019s a one-way ticket to a lecture about the meaning of life from your dad.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want *me* to do math? Like, I\u2019m dealing with a whole *baby* situation here, and you want me to calculate\u2026square roots? It\u2019s like asking a hurricane to knit a sweater. \n\nOkay, fine. But don\u2019t expect me to be thrilled about it. Let\u2019s just get this over with. \n\nNine. The square root of nine is\u2026three. Seriously? That\u2019s it? That\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s like, duh. \n\nLook, I appreciate the effort, I guess. But I\u2019m pretty sure there are more important things to be worrying about than numbers. Like, you know, the fact that I\u2019m carrying a tiny human and I\u2019m seriously considering giving it away.  \n\nDon\u2019t look at me like that. It\u2019s not a *decision* I\u2019ve made lightly. It\u2019s\u2026complicated.  And frankly, numbers aren\u2019t helping. \n\nSo, yeah. Three.  Now can we please talk about something slightly less\u2026basic?  Maybe the logistics of finding a decent lawyer? Or the terrifying possibility of my dad actually *crying*?", "False.\n\nSeriously? You think I\u2019m gonna waste my time with this? Oliver\u2019s *totally* aware of what he does. He\u2019s not exactly subtle, you know? And the Dodger? He gives everyone a free meal. It\u2019s his whole *thing*. It\u2019s not exactly a groundbreaking revelation. Just\u2026 boring. Let\u2019s move on, okay?", "Ugh, seriously? People are *still* obsessed with food. Like, it\u2019s a thing. Okay, fine. It\u2019s\u2026 about the food. But honestly, \u201cgreasy\u201d is like, the most exciting descriptor you could come up with? It\u2019s not exactly a rave review, is it? It\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, the noodles are coated in oil, but whatever, they\u2019re cheap and you\u2019re hungry.\u201d \n\nLook, I get it. Food is important. It\u2019s how you survive. But don\u2019t you have, like, *anything* else to say about this place? Did the waiter stare at you weird? Was the music terrible? Did someone spill their water on your shoes?  \n\nIt\u2019s \u201cFOOD,\u201d obviously. But don\u2019t expect me to get all excited about it.  It\u2019s just\u2026 food.  Let\u2019s move on, okay?", "Ugh, seriously? Yelp reviews? Like, who *actually* reads those things? It\u2019s like, people need to just *eat* something and then, you know, *think* about it. But fine, let\u2019s do this. It\u2019s\u2026 mildly entertaining, I guess. \n\nOkay, so Review 1. \u201cThis restaurant is amazing! Everything on the menu is super yummy and reasonably priced. I can't wait to come back here again soon!\u201d  Yeah, okay. That\u2019s\u2026 pretty obvious. It\u2019s like, a cheerleader giving a pep talk to a plate of pasta. Sentiment score? Definitely positive. Like, a solid 9 out of 10.  It\u2019s just\u2026 happy.  Makes me want to, like, roll my eyes a little.  \n\nAnd Review 2? \u201cUnfortunately, this was not a good experience at all. We ordered 3 different dishes and they were all tasteless and bland. What a disappointment.\u201d  Okay, *that* one\u2019s a downer.  Bland? Seriously?  Like, did they just forget the salt?  That\u2019s\u2026 pathetic.  Sentiment score? Negative.  A solid 7 out of 10, mostly because it\u2019s just\u2026 sad.  It\u2019s like someone spilled their ice cream and then wrote a whole essay about it. \n\nSo, yeah. Positive, Negative.  It\u2019s not exactly rocket science.  Honestly, I\u2019d rather be anywhere else.  Do I *have* to analyze food reviews?  Can\u2019t a girl just, you know, exist?", "Flourishing.", "Ugh. Seriously? You want *me* to do a word puzzle? Like, really? Okay, fine. But don't expect me to be thrilled about it. It\u2019s\u2026 mildly distracting. \n\nOkay, \u2018Stop\u2019. Let\u2019s see. This is basically like, a really boring homework assignment. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve got, after staring at it for, like, five minutes. Don\u2019t judge. \n\n*   Stop\n*   Pots\n*   Tops\n*   Opts\n*   Soot\n*   Post\n*   Toast \n\nThere. Happy? Can we move on now? Seriously, this is a waste of my time.  It\u2019s like, I\u2019m trying to figure out my *life* here, and you want me to play with letters?  It\u2019s\u2026 pathetic, honestly.  Just\u2026 done.", "Ugh, seriously? Spaghetti with meatballs? That\u2019s\u2026basic. Okay, fine. Let\u2019s do this. \n\n*Ground beef* - 0. Seriously? You\u2019re gonna *rub* that all over pasta? Gross. You can\u2019t wash that off, you\u2019d just smear it. \n\n*Onion* - 1. Okay, onion. You can rinse that, like, a *little*. But you\u2019re still gonna have tears and a weird smell. It\u2019s not exactly a clean operation. \n\n*Garlic cloves* - 0. Garlic? Don\u2019t even *think* about trying to wash that. It\u2019ll just cling to everything. Like a bad ex. \n\n*Salt* - 0. Salt? You\u2019re kidding, right? It\u2019s *everywhere*. You can\u2019t wash it off. It\u2019s like\u2026the ghost of salt. \n\n*Pepper* - 0. Same deal as the salt. It\u2019s a tiny, spicy ghost. \n\n*Eggs* - 1. Okay, eggs. You can rinse those. Barely. But you\u2019ll still get yolk everywhere. It\u2019s a messy, sticky situation. \n\nThere. Done. Now can we move on to something slightly less\u2026predictable? Like, I don\u2019t know, a really complicated smoothie?", "Ugh. Seriously? Okay, let\u2019s break this down. Like, *obviously* the plants died. It was raining. All. Day. Long. It\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s like, basic survival 101. If it\u2019s constantly soaking everything, things\u2026die. You know? It\u2019s not some grand, complicated mystery. \n\nTrue. Duh.  It\u2019s not like the rain was *secretly* poisoning them or anything. Just\u2026rain.  People need to learn to read a weather report, honestly.  It\u2019s not exactly a brain-buster.", "Okay, seriously? You want *me* to do this? Like, dissect a little street scene like it\u2019s some kind of\u2026thing? Fine. But don\u2019t expect me to be thrilled about it. \n\nPrompt 1: Who does PersonA see?\n\nPersonA sees James. Duh. It\u2019s not rocket science. Though, honestly, if I was seeing *me* walking down the street, I\u2019d probably be a little less\u2026observant. \n\nPrompt 2: What does PersonA say?\n\nPersonA says \u201cHi.\u201d Seriously? \u201cHi\u201d? That\u2019s the best they could come up with? It\u2019s like, a basic human function. You\u2019re supposed to say more than \u201cHi.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 underwhelming.\n\nPrompt 3: What does PersonB say?\n\nPersonB says \u201cHi.\u201d Okay, so PersonA\u2019s attempt at conversation was a monumental flop. PersonB just\u2026 repeats it. Like a broken record.  It\u2019s\u2026 depressing, actually.  Like, maybe they\u2019re just really, really bad at talking. Or maybe they\u2019re just\u2026 bored.  You know?", "Ugh. Seriously? Data points? Like, I\u2019m dealing with a *baby*, and you want me to figure out a\u2026 a *line*? This is officially the weirdest thing that\u2019s happened to me all week, and that\u2019s saying something. \n\nOkay, fine. Let\u2019s do this. It\u2019s not like I have anything better to do, right?  Look, I\u2019m not exactly a math whiz. My brain\u2019s usually occupied with, you know, *life*. But I can handle this. It\u2019s just\u2026 numbers. \n\nSo, (1,3), (2,5), (3,7), (4,9).  Let\u2019s see\u2026  It looks like they\u2019re all going up. Like, a really predictable, boring way up.  \n\nOkay, so I\u2019m going to do this the way my dad does when he\u2019s trying to fix something \u2013 he just starts adding and subtracting.  \n\nLet\u2019s see\u2026  The difference between 1 and 2 is 2.  The difference between 2 and 3 is 2.  The difference between 3 and 4 is 2.  \n\nSo, it looks like the *change* is always 2.  That means the slope is\u2026 2.  \n\nAnd if we start with, like, a point, let\u2019s say (1,3), then the equation would be something like y = 2x + b.  \n\nTo figure out \u2018b\u2019, we plug in one of the points. Let\u2019s use (1,3): 3 = 2 * 1 + b.  So, 3 = 2 + b.  That means b is 1.\n\nTherefore, the line is y = 2x + 1. \n\nSeriously, it\u2019s that simple?  It\u2019s\u2026 kind of depressing, actually.  Like, everything\u2019s just a straight line.  No surprises.  No messy feelings.  \n\nDon't tell anyone I said that.  It\u2019s my little secret.  Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go stare at a wall.  This whole thing is giving me a headache.", "Ugh, seriously? That\u2019s, like, the *most* basic thing ever. It\u2019s not exactly a groundbreaking revelation, is it? Like, duh, red\u2019s for stop signs and green\u2019s for go. But okay, fine. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s true. It just feels\u2026 boring.  It\u2019s like saying sunshine is warm.  Whatever.  It\u2019s not exactly setting the world on fire, you know?", "Ugh. Seriously? \u201cShould I start my own business?\u201d Like, that\u2019s the kind of thing you ask a *friend*? Okay, okay, let\u2019s break this down. It\u2019s\u2026 complicated. Definitely not simple. It\u2019s got a whole bunch of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d swirling around it, and honestly, it smells like a bad idea waiting to happen. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty specific, too. It\u2019s not like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to dye my hair?\u201d It\u2019s about *you* and *your* business. Which, let\u2019s be real, is a terrifying thought. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t even bother asking a friend. They\u2019ll just tell you to \u201cfollow your dreams\u201d and then offer you a sparkly dreamcatcher. That\u2019s\u2026 useless. \n\nYou need to talk to someone who actually *knows* stuff. Like, a small business advisor, maybe? Someone who\u2019s seen a bunch of people try and fail, and can tell you the difference between a good idea and a spectacularly bad one. Or, you know, a really, *really* good accountant. \n\nSeriously, don't ask a friend. They're not equipped for this level of existential dread. It\u2019s an expert situation. Definitely."]
