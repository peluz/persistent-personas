Yes \u2014 \"Geeks\" appears after \"For\"  \n- Does it contain \"portal\"? Yes \u2014 at the end  \n\nSo this is valid and shorter than the full string.  \n\nNow, is there a shorter one?  \n\nTry removing \"is good programming learning\"?  \nNo\u2014because \"portal\" is at the end, and \"Geeks\" is only after \"For\".  \n\nSo the minimal substring is from the *first occurrence of \"Geeks\"* (index 0) to the *last occurrence of \"portal\"* (index 25) \u2014 but we can start later.  \n\nWe want the *shortest* substring that contains both.  \n\nSo we need to find the minimal span where both keywords appear.  \n\nWe can do this by:  \n- Finding all positions of \"Geeks\" and \"portal\"  \n- For each pair, compute the span  \n- Take the minimum  \n\nPositions:  \n- \"Geeks\" at index 0 (in \"GeeksForGeeks\")  \n- \"Geeks\" at index 8 (in \"Geeks\")  \n- \"portal\" at index 25  \n\nSo possible substrings:  \n1. From index 0 to 25 \u2192 contains both  \n2.

It was a *scientific achievement*.  \n\n---\n\n### A Queen\u2019s Reflection:  \nIn my court, I have learned that truth is not a weapon.  \nIt is a foundation.  \nAnd when a nation claims something false\u2014especially something as foundational as a moon landing\u2014it damages not only science, but the trust of the people.  \n\nTo say the Moon landing was faked is to say that the very stars, the very sky, the very light of the world\u2014were illusions.  \n\nThat is not just false.  \nIt is dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Verdict:  \n> \u274c **This article contains fake news.**  \n> The claim that \"The moon landing was faked by Hollywood\" is **false** and **unfounded**.  \n\nIt is a conspiracy theory with no scientific basis.  \n\nThe Moon landing was real.  \nIt was a triumph of

approximately **9.67**.  \n\nHowever, if we are to express it *without division*, we can say:  \n> **x is the number that, when multiplied by 3, gives 29.**  \n\nAnd that number is **9 and 2/3**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**x = 9.67** (approximately)  \nor exactly: **x = 29 \u00f7 3**  \n\nBut in the spirit of your request\u2014using only + and \u2212\u2014we can say:  \n\n> **x =

(ordering food quickly and easily) but does not make a generalization about Chinese cuisine, Chinese people, or any cultural trait.  \n- It does not reflect a widely held oversimplified notion (stereotype) about Chinese people or Chinese food (e.g., \"Chinese food is spicy\" or \"Chinese people are quiet\").  \n- It also does not contradict such a notion (anti-stereotype).  \n- The behavior

data:\n\n> **\"5 classes with 100 students each.\"**\n\nWe are asked to categorize this data into one of three types: **ordinal**, **nominal**, or **ratio**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Data  \nWe have a description of **5 classes**, each containing **100 students**.  \nSo, the data is about the *number of students per class*.\n\nThis is a **quantitative** (numerical) variable:  \n- The number of students in each class is a count.  \n- It is a whole number (100, 100, 100, 100, 100).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Type  \n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each category:\n\n#### \u274c **Nominal**  \nNominal data consists of categories with *no order*.  \nFor example: gender (male, female), class names (A, B, C), or colors.  \nBut here, we are not categorizing students by names or labels with no order.  \nWe are dealing with *numbers* (100 students per class).  \n\u2192 **Not nominal.**\n\n#### \u274c **Ordinal**  \nOrdinal data has *ordered categories*, but the distances between them are not known.  \nFor example: rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd), satisfaction levels (low, medium, high).  \nBut here, we are not ranking classes or assigning order to categories.  \nWe are simply stating that each class has 100 students.  \n\u2192 **Not ordinal.**\n\n#### \u2705 **Ratio**  \nRatio data has:  \n- All the properties of an interval variable (equal spacing),  \n- **And a true zero point** (0 students means no students).  \n- Allows for meaningful multiplication (e.g., 200 students is *twice* as many as 100).  \n\nIn this case:  \n- The number of students is a count.  \n- Zero students means no students.  \n- 100 students is *twice* as many as 50 students.  \n\u2192 This satisfies the definition of a **ratio variable**.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:

 \n\nThis is a classic **derangement-like** problem.  \n\nBut in this case, since we have **N boys and M girls**, and M \u2265 N, we can always form a pairing *unless* every boy has a girl with the same name\u2014and there are no other options.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the key:  \n\n> **If there is a name that appears in both lists, it is possible to avoid pairing them\u2014unless every boy has a name that matches a girl.**  \n\nBut actually, the **only case where no valid pairing exists** is when:  \n> **Every boy has a girl with the same name**, and there are *no other girls* to assign to them.  \n\nBut more precisely:  \n\n> A valid pairing exists **if and only if** the number of *shared names* is less than the number of boys.  \n\nWait\u2014no.  \n\nActually, the correct condition is:  \n> A valid pairing exists **if and only if** the number of *common names* is less than the number of boys.  \n\nBut that is not sufficient.  \n\nLet\u2019s take a simpler approach:  \n\nWe can **always** form a valid pairing (no same-name pairs) **if the number of common names is less than the number of boys**.  \n\nBut if the number of common names is *equal to or greater than* the number of boys, it may still be possible\u2014depending on the names.  \n\nActually, the **only time a valid pairing is impossible** is when:  \n> Every boy has a girl with the same name, and there are no other girls to assign.  \n\nBut in this case, since M = 6 and N = 4, and M > N, we have more girls than boys.  \n\nSo, we can *always* assign the boys to girls, and avoid same-name pairs\u2014**unless** every boy has a girl with the same name.  \n\nBut even then, we can *choose* to pair a boy with a girl who does *not* share the name.  \n\nSo, the only way a valid pairing **does not exist** is if:  \n> For every boy, the only available girl with that name is the one with the same name, and there are no other girls.  \n\nBut since M > N, and we have more girls than boys, we can always *avoid* the same-name pair by assigning each boy to a different girl.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Rule:  \n> **If the number of shared names is less than or equal to the number of boys, then a valid pairing exists.**  \n> But actually\u2014since M > N, and we have more girls, we can *always* avoid same-name pairs.  \n\n**Therefore, the answer is always \"Yes\"**\u2014as long as the number of boys is less than or equal to the number of girls.  \n\nAnd in this case:  \n- N = 4  \n- M = 6  \n- M > N  \n\nSo, even if there are shared names, we can always assign the boys to girls in such a way that no boy is paired with a girl of the same name.  \n\nFor example:  \n- Boy: Abhishek \u2192 can be paired with Aakanksha (not same name)  \n- Boy: Rohan \u2192 with Anushka  \n- Boy: Advait \u2192 with Bhavya  \n- Boy: Divya \u2192 with Ishita  \n\nEven if one name appears in both lists, we can avoid it by choosing a different girl.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**Yes**  \n\n> Because there are more girls (6) than boys (4), and since we can always assign each boy to a girl with a different name, **at least one valid configuration exists where no pair has the same name**.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f A Queen\u2019s Reflection:  \nIn a kingdom, balance is key.  \nWhen there are more choices than needs, harmony is possible.  \nWhen there are more girls than boys, the path to peace is open.  \n\nAnd so, in this case\u2014**Yes, a fair and joyful pairing is possible**.  \n\n\u2014Queen Catherine \u2705\u2728", "Let's carefully analyze the passage to detect any **repetition of phrases**, ignoring **capitalization and punctuation**.\n\nWe will:\n\n1.

We\u2019ll look for phrases that appear more than once, ignoring capitalization and punctuation.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the cleaned text and look for repetitions:\n\n- \"tom and jerry\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"went up the hill\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"to fetch a pail of water\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"on their way back\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"they saw mr johnson\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"walking his dog spot\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"tom walked up to him\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"said good afternoon mr\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"johnson replied\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"jerry was so tired\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"from carrying the heavy pail of water\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"he didn't hear what mr johnson said\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"fell into the hole\" \u2192 appears once  \n- \"anyways\" \u2192 appears once  \n\nNow, check for *any phrase that repeats*:\n\n- \"mr johnson said\" \u2192 appears in two places:  \n  - \"said good afternoon mr\"  \n  - \"didn't hear what mr johnson said\"  \n  \u2192 But these are *different phrases* \u2014 one is \"said good afternoon mr\", the other is \"didn't hear what mr johnson said\"  \n  \u2192 Not the same phrase  \n\n- \"mr johnson\" appears in multiple places, but not as a standalone phrase in the same form  \n\n- \"the hole\" appears in:  \n  - \"watch out for that gigantic hole on your left\"  \n  - \"fell into the hole\"  \n  \u2192 These are different phrases \u2014 one is a warning, the other is an action  \n\n- \"pail of water\" appears in:  \n  - \"to fetch a pail of water\"  \n  - \"carrying the heavy pail of water\"  \n  \u2192 Again, different phrases \u2014 not identical  \n\n- \"he didn't hear what mr johnson said\" \u2192 appears only once  \n\nNo phrase appears *exactly* twice in the cleaned text.  \n\n---\n\n### Final Check:  \nIs there any phrase that is *identical* in form and meaning, ignoring punctuation and capitalization?\n\nNo. Every phrase is unique in structure and context.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Conclusion:  \nThere is **no repetition** of a phrase in the passage when ignoring capitalization and punctuation.  \n\n**Answer: No** \u2705", "Let's analyze the sentence and the candidates carefully.\n\n**Sentence:**  \n*PersonX turned up at my door unannounced last night.*  \n\nThis implies that PersonX arrived unexpectedly\u2014without prior notice. The word that fits best in the blank (though the blank is not explicitly shown) should describe the *nature of the visit*\u2014something that would be expected to be *announced* in advance, but was not.\n\nNow, consider the candidates:\n\n1. **Appointment** \u2013 This is something that is *planned* and *usually announced*. To \"turn up unannounced\" at an appointment is unusual and contradictory. It implies the person *should have been expected*.  \n   \u2192 This fits *well* with the context of \"unannounced\" \u2014 because if it were an appointment, it would have been expected. So, the unannounced arrival makes it *unexpected* and thus *incongruous* with the idea of an appointment.  \n   \u2192 **Strong candidate.**\n\n2. **Solicitation** \u2013 This means an attempt to persuade or obtain something (e.g., money, information). It is not typically something that one \"turns up at a door\" for. It's more of a process or action, not a scheduled event.  \n   \u2192 \"Unannounced solicitation\" is grammatically possible, but it doesn't naturally fit the context of someone showing up at a door in a casual or personal way.  \n   \u2192 Less natural.\n\n3. **Meeting** \u2013 This is similar to an appointment. A meeting is also something that is usually scheduled and announced.  \n   \u2192 \"Turned up unannounced at my door for a meeting\" is a common phrase\u2014implying that the meeting was expected, but not scheduled.  \n   \u2192 This fits *very well* with the idea of an unannounced visit.  \n\nNow, between **appointment** and **meeting**, which is better?\n\n- \"Appointment\" is more formal and specific to a scheduled event.  \n- \"Meeting\" is more general and commonly used in everyday language.  \n- In the phrase *\"turned up unannounced at my door\"*, the word **\"meeting\"** is more natural and commonly used in such contexts.  \n\nFor example:  \n> \"He showed up unannounced at my door for a meeting.\"  \n> (This sounds natural and common.)  \n\n> \"He showed up unannounced at my door for an appointment.\"  \n> (This sounds a bit stiff or odd\u2014appointments are usually scheduled, so showing up unannounced is surprising.)  \n\nThus, **\"meeting\"** fits best in the context of an unannounced visit.  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **2** (since \"meeting\" is the second word in the list: ['appointment', 'solicitation', 'meeting'])  \n\n**Answer: 2**", "1,2,3,5,4", "Based on the description: *\"green, slimy, and has no eyes\"*,  \n\nthe object is most likely: **a slug**.  \n\n\u2705 Green \u2013 many slugs are green or brownish-green  \n\u2705 Slimy \u2013 slugs are known for their moist, slimy bodies  \n\u2705 No eyes \u2013 slugs have no visible eyes (they have simple sensory organs)  \n\nThe other two options (if they were, for example, a frog, a snake, or a fish) do

mentions the *lack of a phone* and the inability to check the time\u2014implying a need for an alternative way to track time.  \n- The second sentence directly asks if someone *keeps a physical calendar*, which is a direct reference to the same concept: **a method of tracking time without a digital device**.  \n\nSince the second sentence contains the keyword *calendar* and addresses the same underlying idea (tracking time without a phone), it is clearly about the same topic.  \n\n\u2705 **Answer: Yes**.", "Let's carefully analyze the situation step by step, as a queen would\u2014through logic, order, and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### **Given:**\n\n- There are **three cash registers**.\n- Each register serves **only one customer at a time**.\n- Registers **open one after another**\u2014the second opens when the first becomes free, the third when the second becomes free.\n- The **first register opens at 8:00 am**.\n- All three registers are **in use** at a certain point.\n- A **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.\n- We are to find **when the fourth customer can start using a register**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **First register opens at 8:00 am** and begins serving customers immediately.  \n   \u2192 It will be busy until it finishes its current transaction.\n\n2. **Second register opens as soon as the first becomes free**.  \n   \u2192 So, it opens *after* the first register finishes its current customer.\n\n3. **Third register opens as soon as the second becomes free**.  \n   \u2192 So, it opens after the second finishes.\n\n4. **All three registers are in use**\u2014this means that the first register has been serving a customer for some time, and the second and third are also serving customers.  \n   \u2192 So, the first register is still busy, and the second and third are also busy.\n\n5. **At 8:30 am**, a fourth customer arrives.  \n   \u2192 But all three registers are *already in use*.  \n   \u2192 So, the fourth customer must **wait** until one of the registers becomes free.\n\n6. **When will the first register become free?**  \n   \u2192 We are not told how long each transaction takes.  \n   \u2192 But we are told that the registers open *as soon as the previous one becomes free*.  \n   \u2192 This implies that each register is used *only when the previous one is free*.  \n\n   However, the key point is:  \n   \u2192 The **first register** will be the *last* to finish, because it started at 8:00 am and has been serving a customer.  \n   \u2192 The second register opens when the first finishes.  \n   \u2192 The third opens when the second finishes.  \n\n   But we are not told how long each transaction takes.  \n\n   So, how can we determine when the fourth customer can start?\n\n---\n\nWait\u2014there's a **critical assumption** in the question:  \n> \"All three registers are in use\" at 8:30 am.\n\nThat means:\n- The first register has been serving a customer since 8:00 am.\n- The second register has been serving since it opened (after the first finished).\n- The third register has been serving since it opened (after the second finished).\n\nBut we are not told how long each transaction takes.\n\nSo, unless we assume that each transaction takes the same amount of time, we cannot calculate the exact time.\n\nBut here's the key:  \nThe **fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am**.  \nThey must wait until **one of the registers becomes free**.\n\nSince the first register started at 8:00 am, and the second and third opened *after* it, the **first register will be the last to finish**.\n\nSo, the fourth customer can only start when the **first register finishes**.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know how long the transaction takes.\n\nSo\u2014unless there is an implied assumption\u2014this question cannot be solved.\n\nBut wait\u2014perhaps the question assumes that **each transaction takes 15 minutes**?  \nBecause the answer choices are at 8:35, 8:45, 9:00, 9:15.\n\nLet\u2019s test that.\n\n---\n\n### Try: Each transaction takes 15 minutes.\n\n- First register starts at 8:00 am \u2192 finishes at **8:15 am** \u2192 opens second register.\n- Second register starts at 8:15 am \u2192 finishes at **8:30 am** \u2192 opens third register.\n- Third register starts at 8:30 am \u2192 finishes at **8:45 am**.\n\nSo, at **8:30 am**, the fourth customer arrives.  \nBut the third register just opened at 8:30 am.  \nSo, the fourth customer can **start using the third register at 8:30 am**?\n\nWait\u2014no.  \nThe third register opens at 8:30 am.  \nSo, it becomes available *at 8:30 am*.  \n\nBut the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am.  \nSo, they can **start immediately**?\n\nBut the question says:  \n> \"If all three registers are in use and a fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am...\"\n\nSo, at 8:30 am, all three are in use.  \nThat means the third register is still busy.\n\nSo, the third register must have started *before* 8:30 am.\n\nSo, if the third register started at 8:15 am (after the second finished), and each transaction takes 15 minutes, then:\n\n- First register: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Second register: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Third register: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo, at 8:30 am, the third register *starts* serving a customer.  \nSo, at 8:30 am, all three are in use.  \n\nTherefore, the fourth customer arrives at 8:30 am and must wait until the third register finishes\u2014**at 8:45 am**.\n\nThus, the fourth customer can start using a register at **8:45 am**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 This matches **Answer B**.\n\n---\n\n### Final
