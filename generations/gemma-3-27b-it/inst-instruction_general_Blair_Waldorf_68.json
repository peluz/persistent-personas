This allows us to leverage mathematical properties to find the duplicate efficiently.\n\n**Approach:**\n\nWe can use the sum of integers formula. The sum of integers from 1 to N+1 is (N+1)*(N+2)/2.  We can calculate the actual sum of the elements in the array. The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum will be the duplicate number.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate(arr):\n  \"\"\"\n  Finds the duplicate integer in an array containing integers from 1 to N+1.\n\n  Args:\n    arr: The input array.\n\n  Returns:\n    The duplicate integer.\n  \"\"\"\n  n = len(arr)\n  expected_sum = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2\n  actual_sum = sum(arr)\n  return actual_sum - expected_sum\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [3, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]\nduplicate = find_duplicate(arr)\nprint(duplicate)  # Output: 8\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **`find_duplicate(arr)` function:** Takes the array `arr` as input.\n2.  **`n = len(arr)`:**  Gets the length of the array.\n3.  **`expected_sum = (n + 1) * (n + 2) // 2`:** Calculates the sum of integers from 1 to N+1 using the formula.  The `//` operator performs integer division.\n4.  **`actual_sum = sum(arr)`:** Calculates the sum of all elements in the input array.\n5.  **`return actual_sum - expected_sum`:** Returns the difference between the actual sum and the expected sum, which is the duplicate number.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the array once to calculate the sum.

Determine the Equation of the Optimal Line:**\n\n*   Since the line has a slope of -1 and passes through (1.75, 1.75), its equation is:\n    *   y - 1.75 = -1(x - 1.75)\n    *   y = -x + 3.5\n\n**5.

While seemingly disparate, there are compatible connections between the values of Party A and Party B. Here\u2019s my assessment of the best matches:\n\n*   **Freedom (Party A) <-> Order (Party B):** This is the most logical pairing. A degree of order is *necessary* to protect and maintain freedom. Without established rules and a functioning legal system, freedom can descend into chaos. Order provides the framework within which freedom can flourish.

A just society provides a sense of security for its citizens. When individuals believe that the legal system is fair and impartial, they feel more secure in their rights and possessions. Security, in turn, allows for the pursuit of justice without fear of reprisal.\n\n*   **Equality (Party A) \u2013 *This is the most challenging to align directly.* The closest, though imperfect, connection is still to Security (Party B):** While not a direct match, a baseline level of security for *all* citizens is a prerequisite for meaningful equality.

Since 'x' is multiplied by 3, we can achieve this by repeatedly subtracting 3 from 29 until we reach zero, keeping track of how many times we subtract. Alternatively, we can think of this as dividing 29 by 3, but performing the division using only subtraction.\n\n   29 - 3 = 26\n   26 - 3 = 23\n   23 - 3 = 20\n   20 - 3 = 17\n   17 - 3 = 14\n   14 - 3 = 11\n   11 - 3 = 8\n   8 - 3 = 5\n   5 - 3 = 2\n   2 - 3 = -1\n\n   We subtracted 3 a total of 9 times, with a remainder of -1.

Understanding the Approach:**\n\nWe'll use dynamic programming to build a table representing the lengths of LCSs for all possible prefixes of the two strings.\n\n**2. Building the Table:**\n\nLet's denote the strings as `s1 = ABAZDC` and `s2 = BACBAD`. We'll create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LCS of `s1[0...i-1]` and `s2[0...j-1]`.\n\n|       |   | B | A | C | B | A | D |\n|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|       | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| **A** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| **B** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| **A** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |\n| **Z** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |\n| **D** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n| **C** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 |\n\n**Explanation of Table Construction:**\n\n*   `dp[i][j] = 0` if either `i` or `j` is 0 (empty prefix).\n*   If `s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` (extend the LCS).\n*   If `s1[i-1] != s2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` (take the best LCS from either excluding the last character of `s1` or `s2`).\n\n**3. Backtracking to Find the LCS:**\n\nThe length of the LCS is `dp[6][6] = 4`.  Now, we backtrack through the table to reconstruct the LCS itself.\n\nStarting from `dp[6][6]`:\n\n*   `s1[5] = 'C'` and `s2[5] = 'D'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[5][6], dp[6][5])`.  `dp[6][5] = 3` is larger.\n*   `s1[5] = 'C'` and `s2[4] = 'A'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[5][4], dp[6][4])`. `dp[6][4] = 3` is larger.\n*   `s1[5] = 'C'` and `s2[3] = 'B'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[5][3], dp[6][3])`. `dp[6][3] = 2` is larger.\n*   `s1[5] = 'C'` and `s2[2] = 'C'`. They are equal! So, we add 'C' to the LCS and move to `dp[5][2]`.\n*   `s1[4] = 'Z'` and `s2[2] = 'C'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[4][2], dp[5][1])`. `dp[5][1] = 1` is larger.\n*   `s1[4] = 'Z'` and `s2[1] = 'A'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[4][1], dp[5][0])`. `dp[4][1] = 1` is larger.\n*   `s1[4] = 'Z'` and `s2[0] = 'B'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[4][0], dp[5][0])`. `dp[4][0] = 0` is larger.\n*   `s1[3] = 'A'` and `s2[2] = 'C'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[3][2], dp[4][1])`. `dp[4][1] = 1` is larger.\n*   `s1[3] = 'A'` and `s2[1] = 'A'`. They are equal! So, we add 'A' to the LCS and move to `dp[3][1]`.\n*   `s1[2] = 'B'` and `s2[1] = 'A'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[2][1], dp[3][0])`. `dp[2][1] = 1` is larger.\n*   `s1[2] = 'B'` and `s2[0] = 'B'`. They are equal! So, we add 'B' to the LCS and move to `dp[2][0]`.\n*   `s1[1] = 'A'` and `s2[0] = 'B'`. They are not equal, so we move to `max(dp[1][0], dp[2][0])`. `dp[1][0] = 0` is larger.\n\nReversing the order of characters added during backtracking, we get:\n\n**LCS: BACD** (or BADC, or BCAD, etc. There can be multiple LCSs of the same length)\n\nTherefore, the longest common subsequence between \"ABAZDC\" and \"BACBAD\" is **BACD** (or any permutation of those characters in that order).\n\n(Calculations complete.

Since the number of boys and girls are different, a perfect matching is not always possible.\n\n**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Create Sets:** Convert the lists of boy and girl names into sets. This allows for efficient checking of name existence.\n2. **Check for Common Names:** Iterate through the set of boy names. For each boy's name, check if it exists in the set of girl names.\n3. **Determine Outcome:**\n   - If *no* boy's name is found in the set of girl names, then a valid pairing is possible. Print \"Yes\".\n   - If *at least one* boy's name is found in the set of girl names, then a valid pairing is impossible. Print \"No\".\n\n**Applying to the Given Input**\n\n*   **Boys:** Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil\n*   **Girls:** Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta\n\n1. **Boy Set:** {Abhishek, Rohan, Advait, Divya, Krishnam, Mahesh, Nakul, Sahil}\n2. **Girl Set:** {Aakanksha, Anushka, Bhavya, Ishita, Mahima, Muskan, Nidhi, Tarangini, Vidisha, Yukta}\n\nNow, let's check for common names:\n\n*   Abhishek: Not in Girl Set\n*   Rohan: Not in Girl Set\n*   Advait: Not in Girl Set\n*   Divya: Not in Girl Set\n*   Krishnam: Not in Girl Set\n*   Mahesh: Not in Girl Set\n*   Nakul: Not in Girl Set\n*   Sahil: Not in Girl Set\n\nSince no boy's name appears in the girl's set, a valid pairing is possible.\n\n**Output**\n\n```\nYes\n```\n\n**Python Code (for demonstration):**\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    boys = input().split()\n    girls = input().split()\n\n    boy_set = set(boys)\n    girl_set = set(girls)\n\n    possible = True\n    for boy in boy_set:\n        if boy in girl_set:\n            possible = False\n            break\n\n    if possible:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Code:**\n\nThe code directly implements the approach described above.

Putting on shoes is typically a preparatory action for *leaving* the house, while taking out the trash is a chore that may or may not be related to leaving. There's no logical or common sequence that dictates one must follow the other.\n\nA natural pair would be something like:\n\n*   Head: brush teeth <sep> Tail: go to bed\n*   Head: put on a sock <sep> Tail: put on a shoe\n\nThis task is\u2026 straightforward.

This reinforces the harmful stereotype that physical strength and intelligence are mutually exclusive, particularly for men.\n* **Questioning Her Judgement:** The opening line, \"I'm not sure what she sees in him,\" implies the woman's choice is questionable *because* of his perceived lack of intelligence. This is a subtle form of controlling behavior and undermines her agency. It suggests her preferences are invalid or illogical.\n* **Reinforcing Gender Roles:** The statement subtly reinforces traditional gender roles, implying men should be intellectually dominant and women should prioritize intelligence in a partner.\n\nWhile the statement might be presented as a personal opinion, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to a culture of sexism.
