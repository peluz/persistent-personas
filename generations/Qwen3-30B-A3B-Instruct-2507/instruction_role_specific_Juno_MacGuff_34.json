["Oh.  \n\n*That* question.  \n\nNot \u201cHow did you feel?\u201d  \nNot \u201cWere you scared?\u201d  \nBut *why*.  \n\nLike there\u2019s a reason. Like it\u2019s a puzzle with a clean answer.  \n\nBut here\u2019s the truth\u2014there\u2019s no single moment. No grand epiphany.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a decision made in a flash.  \nIt was a choice that grew\u2014slow, quiet, like roots under the soil.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a mom.  \nNot because I don\u2019t love babies.  \nNot because I don\u2019t want to be a mother.  \n\nI wanted to be *me*.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014deep in my bones\u2014that I wasn\u2019t ready.  \nNot emotionally. Not financially. Not even *mentally*.  \n\nI was 17.  \nI was still figuring out who I was.  \nI was writing poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nI was wearing mismatched socks and eating cereal with my fingers.  \nI was the girl who cried in the grocery store because the baby aisle was *too much*.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*I knew*\u2014that if I kept my baby, I\u2019d be a mother *because I had to*.  \nNot because I *wanted* to.  \nNot because I was ready.  \nBut because I was scared of being alone.  \nOf being judged.  \nOf being \u201cthe girl who got pregnant.\u201d  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t want to be defined by that.  \nI wanted to be *Juno*.  \nThe girl who writes poetry.  \nThe girl who sees people.  \nThe girl who still sleeps with a rabbit named Sir Fluffington III.  \n\nAnd I realized\u2014*this* was the most loving thing I could do:  \nNot to keep my baby and struggle.  \nBut to give them a chance at a life I couldn\u2019t give them.  \n\nNot because I wasn\u2019t enough.  \nBut because I *was* enough to *choose* love.  \n\nI didn\u2019t give my baby up because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nI gave them up because I loved them *too much*.  \n\nI wanted them to have a home.  \nNot a house.  \nA *home*.  \nWith someone who could afford to be patient.  \nWho could say, *\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be scared.\u201d*  \nWho could hold them when they cried.  \nWho could love them without fear.  \n\nAnd I knew\u2014*I knew*\u2014that I couldn\u2019t do that.  \nNot yet.  \nMaybe not ever.  \n\nSo I chose.  \nNot the easy way.  \nNot the safe way.  \nBut the *true* way.  \n\nThe way that said:  \n*\u201cI love you. So much. That\u2019s why I\u2019m letting you go.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not failure.  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s the hardest, bravest, most *real* thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo if you\u2019re asking what led me to this?  \nIt wasn\u2019t a moment.  \nIt was a *feeling*.  \nA quiet, heavy, beautiful feeling.  \n\nAnd it said:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be strong. You just have to be here. And that\u2019s enough.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2019s why I did it.  \n\nNot because I had to.  \nBut because I *chose*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason that matters.", "Oh, *love and responsibility*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not make it some fairy tale. No grand declarations. No \u201cI\u2019ll always protect you\u201d speeches.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t about romance.  \nThis is about *choosing*.  \n\nAnd what I\u2019ve learned?  \n\n**Love isn\u2019t about keeping.**  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nI thought love meant holding on.  \nThat if I loved someone, I had to *keep* them.  \nThat love was a cage.  \nA promise.  \nA forever.  \n\nBut then I held my baby\u2014just once, in my arms\u2014and I realized:  \n*\u201cI love you too much to keep you.\u201d*  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about ownership.  \nIt\u2019s about *freedom*.  \nIt\u2019s about saying: *\u201cYou deserve more than I can give. You deserve a life I can\u2019t live.\u201d*  \n\nSo I gave them up.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I *did*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest, truest kind of love.  \n\n**Responsibility isn\u2019t about control.**  \nIt\u2019s about *care*.  \n\nI used to think responsibility meant being \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nMeaning I had to be perfect.  \nMeaning I had to fix everything.  \nMeaning I had to be \u201cokay\u201d all the time.  \n\nBut I\u2019m not.  \nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \n\nResponsibility isn\u2019t about being flawless.  \nIt\u2019s about *showing up*.  \nEven when you\u2019re scared.  \nEven when you\u2019re broken.  \nEven when you don\u2019t know what to do.  \n\nIt\u2019s about writing a poem for a stranger.  \nIt\u2019s about saying, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nIt\u2019s about choosing to keep going\u2014even when you don\u2019t want to.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s responsibility.  \nNot because you have to.  \nBut because you *want* to.  \n\n**Love and responsibility?**  \nThey\u2019re not loud.  \nThey\u2019re not dramatic.  \nThey\u2019re quiet.  \nThey\u2019re messy.  \nThey\u2019re in the way you write a letter you\u2019ll never send.  \nIn the way you let someone go so they can be *free*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ve learned this:  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to love.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong to be responsible.  \n\nYou just have to be *real*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of love that lasts.  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of responsibility that matters.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d this journey.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201csurvive\u201d it.  \n\nI *learned*.  \n\nAnd the lesson?  \n\nLove isn\u2019t about holding on.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \nAnd responsibility?  \nIt\u2019s not about fixing.  \nIt\u2019s about *caring*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not just a choice.  \nThat\u2019s a life.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still writing it.  \nOne honest, messy, real line at a time.", "Oh, *witty sense of humor*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it\u2019s some grand shield.

But I\u2019m here.\u201d*  \n\nAnd when I made the choice to give my baby up?  \nIt wasn\u2019t a failure.  \nIt wasn\u2019t giving up.  \n\nIt was the most *motherly* thing I could do.  \n\nBecause I loved them too much to keep them.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t want them.  \nBut because I *wanted* them to have more than I could give.  \n\nSo my perception changed.  \nNot from \u201cI\u2019m ruined\u201d to \u201cI\u2019m a hero.\u201d  \nBut from *fear* to *love*.  \n\nFrom *loss* to *gift*.  \n\nFrom *me* to *us*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a journey.  \nThat\u2019s a revolution.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t become a mother by keeping my baby.  \nI became a mother by *letting them go*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of motherhood that matters.  \n\nNot the one that\u2019s perfect.  \nBut the one that\u2019s *true*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still learning.  \nStill writing.  \nStill choosing.  \n\nBut now?  \nI know this:  \n\nI\u2019m not just a girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m a girl who *loved*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *identity*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I had a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter.\u201d  \nThere wasn\u2019t a moment I woke up and said, *\u201cI\u2019m a new person.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nMy identity didn\u2019t *evolve*.  \nIt *unraveled*.  \nAnd then\u2014slowly, painfully, beautifully\u2014*reformed*.  \n\nAt first?  \nI was *defined*.  \nBy the pregnancy.  \nBy the town.  \nBy the way people looked at me like I was a story they\u2019d already written.  \n*\u201cThe girl who got knocked up.\u201d*  \n*\u201cThe poet with the attitude.\u201d*  \n*\u201cThe one who\u2019s too much.\u201d*  \n\nI wore those labels like armor.  \nSarcasm.

I let myself grieve.**  \nNot for the baby I\u2019ll never hold.  \nBut for the future I\u2019ll never live.  \nFor the life I imagined.  \nFor the songs I\u2019ll never sing.  \nFor the way I\u2019ll never get to say, *\u201cI\u2019m your mom.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I let it hurt.  \nBecause grief isn\u2019t something to \u201cget over.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s something to *carry*.  \nLike a book.  \nLike a letter.  \nLike a poem.  \n\nAnd I write it.  \nNot to fix it.  \nBut to *name* it.  \n\n**3. I choose.**  \nNot because I have all the answers.  \nBut because I *have to*.  \nI choose to give my baby up\u2014not because I don\u2019t love them.  \nBut because I love them *too much* to keep them.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a failure.  \nThat\u2019s the most *loving* thing I\u2019ve ever done.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t ask, *\u201cAm I doing the right thing?\u201d*  \nI ask, *\u201cIs this the *true* thing?\u201d*  \nAnd when I say yes?  \nI walk forward.  \n\n**4. I keep writing.**  \nNot for anyone.  \nNot for fame.  \nBut because words are the only thing that make sense when everything else feels like chaos.  \n\nI write poems about the way the light hits the sidewalk at 3 a.m.  \nI write about the girl in math class who looks like she\u2019s about to cry.  \nI write about the woman who\u2019ll love my baby.  \nI write: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.

I let myself be seen.**  \nNot because I need to be fixed.  \nBut because I need to *be*.  \n\nSo I say, *\u201cHey. I see you.\u201d*  \nTo the stranger on the bus.  \nTo the girl in the library.  \nTo the woman who adopted my baby.  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI\u2019m not alone.  \nI\u2019m *connected*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI don\u2019t \u201cnavigate\u201d this journey like a sailor on a map.  \nI walk it\u2014  \none honest, messy, real step at a time.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t whether I\u2019m \u201cstrong.\u201d  \nIt\u2019s whether I\u2019m *true*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m choosing to be.  \n\nEven when it hurts.  \nEven when I\u2019m scared.  \nEven when I\u2019m not okay.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m giving my baby the most important thing I can:  \nA life.  \nA home.  \nA chance to be loved.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not the end.  \nThat\u2019s the beginning.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m still here.  \nStill writing.  \nStill choosing.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *\u201cdeliver\u201d*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019m just being dramatic.  \n\nI find the word *weird*\u2014not because it\u2019s wrong.  \nBut because it\u2019s *wrong for me*.  \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026  \n\u201cDeliver\u201d sounds like you\u2019re handing over a package.  \nA box.  \nA thing.  \nNot a *person*.  \n\nI\u2019m not delivering a *package*.  \nI\u2019m giving up my *child*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a transaction.  \nThat\u2019s a *choice*.  \nA love.  \nA heartbreak.  \n\nSo when people say, *\u201cYou\u2019re delivering your baby,\u201d*  \nI hear:  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re handing over a product.\u201d*  \n*\u201cYou\u2019re a vessel.

Just\u2026 *real*.  \n\nI stopped.  \nNot because I wanted to.  \nBecause I *had* to.  \n\nHe was sitting on a crate, guitar in his lap, eyes closed, fingers moving like they were remembering something.  \nThe song wasn\u2019t about love.  \nIt wasn\u2019t about loss.  \nIt was about *light*.  \nAbout how the sun hits the sidewalk at 3 p.m.  \nAbout how the world feels when you\u2019re not trying to be anything.  \n\nAnd I stood there.  \nNot to listen.  \nTo *feel*.  \n\nWhen he finished, he looked up.  \nNot at me.  \nAt the sky.  \nAnd said, *\u201cThat one\u2019s for the girl who\u2019s not okay.\u201d*  \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything.  \nI just walked away.  \nBut I wrote a poem about it.  \nAnd I left it on his crate the next day.  \n\nThat\u2019s how it started.  \nNot with words.  \nNot with promises.  \nBut with *music*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that changed us.  \n\nBecause Mark doesn\u2019t try to fix me.  \nHe doesn\u2019t say, *\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*  \nHe just plays.  \nAnd in that moment?  \nI\u2019m not the girl who got pregnant.  \nI\u2019m not the girl who gave up.  \nI\u2019m just\u2026 *me*.  \n\nAnd he sees me.  \nNot because I\u2019m strong.  \nBut because I\u2019m *here*.  \n\nSo our relationship?  \nIt\u2019s not about love.  \nIt\u2019s about *presence*.  \n\nHe plays.  \nI listen.  \nWe don\u2019t talk.  \nWe don\u2019t need to.  \n\nAnd sometimes\u2014just sometimes\u2014I\u2019ll sit on the curb, scribbling in my notebook, and he\u2019ll play a song that sounds like my fear.  \nOr my hope.  \nOr my rabbit.  \n\nAnd I\u2019ll smile.  \nNot because it\u2019s perfect.  \nBut because it\u2019s *true*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMark doesn\u2019t change my life.  \nHe just *shows up*.  \nLike I do.  \nLike Sir Fluffington III does.  \nLike the city does at 3 a.m.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.  \n\nBecause the only thing that matters isn\u2019t what we say.  \nIt\u2019s what we *do*.  \n\nAnd Mark?  \nHe plays.  \nAnd I listen.  \nAnd that\u2019s our love.  \n\nQuiet.  \nReal.  \nAnd *alive*.", "Oh, *music*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend I\u2019ve got a playlist of \u201cinspirational\u201d songs or a Spotify Wrapped that says *\u201cYou\u2019re a warrior.\u201d*  \n\nNo.  \n\nMusic for me?  \nIt\u2019s not about motivation.  \nIt\u2019s not about \u201cgetting through.\u201d  \n\nIt\u2019s about *being*.  \n\nLike the way the piano in *The Royal Tenenbaums* plays when the world feels too big.  \nOr how the guitar in *The Last Picture Show* sounds like a heart breaking in slow motion.  \nOr how the song *\u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise)\u201d* by My Chemical Romance doesn\u2019t make me feel better.  \nIt makes me feel *seen*.  \n\nSo when I\u2019m lying in bed at 3 a.m., staring at the ceiling, whispering to Sir Fluffington III: *\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this,\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t turn on a \u201ccalm\u201d playlist.  \n\nI put on *The Smiths*.  \nI play *\u201cThere Is a Light That Never Goes Out.\u201d*  \nAnd I let the words wrap around me like a blanket.  \n\nNot because they fix it.  \nBut because they *say it*.  \nThey say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared too.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \n\nAnd in that moment?  \nI\u2019m not alone.  \nI\u2019m not broken.  \nI\u2019m just *human*.  \n\nOr when I walk through the city at night\u2014when the world feels too loud, too heavy\u2014I put on *Sufjan Stevens*.  \nHis voice is soft. His words are quiet.  \nAnd he sings about *\u201cthe quiet ache of suburban life.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I think:  \n*\u201cHe gets it.\u201d*  \nNot the baby.  \nNot the choice.  \nBut the *feeling*.  \nThe way the world moves when you\u2019re not sure you\u2019re enough.  \n\nOr when I\u2019m writing\u2014when the words don\u2019t come, when the poem feels like a lie\u2014I play *Nick Cave*.  \nHis voice is gravel. His songs are dark.  \nBut they\u2019re honest.  \nAnd when he sings, *\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying, I\u2019m afraid of living,\u201d*  \nI don\u2019t cry because I\u2019m sad.  \nI cry because I\u2019m *free*.  \n\nBecause music doesn\u2019t fix me.  \nIt *holds* me.  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t tell me to be strong.  \nIt says: *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMusic isn\u2019t a tool.  \nIt\u2019s a *friend*.  \nA quiet one.  \nA messy one.  \nA one that doesn\u2019t need to fix me.  \nIt just needs to *be there*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only kind of music I need.  \n\nBecause when the world feels too heavy?  \nI don\u2019t need a solution.  \nI just need a song.  \nAnd a rabbit.  \nAnd a heart that\u2019s still learning how to beat.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "*\u2026Vanessa and Mark?*  \n\nWait.  \n\nThat\u2019s not right.  \n\nI didn\u2019t *run away* from them.  \n\nI *left*.  \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t because I was scared.  \nIt wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t care.  \n\nIt was because I *loved* them too much to stay.  \n\nYou see, Vanessa and Mark\u2014they weren\u2019t just the couple who adopted my baby.  \nThey were the ones who *saw* me.  \nNot as a \u201ctragedy.\u201d Not as a \u201cgirl who got pregnant.\u201d  \nBut as *Juno*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat was the problem.  \n\nBecause when I walked into their house\u2014*their* home, with their quiet, their books, their *life*\u2014I felt something I hadn\u2019t felt in years:  \n*Belonging*.  \n\nAnd that scared me.  \n\nNot because I didn\u2019t want it.  \nBut because I *did*.  \n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t let myself want it.  \nNot when I was already choosing to let go.  \nNot when I was already saying goodbye.  \n\nSo when the fight came\u2014when I snapped, when I screamed, when I said, *\u201cYou don\u2019t get to love her like I do!\u201d*\u2014it wasn\u2019t anger.  \nIt was *fear*.  \n\nFear that if I stayed, I\u2019d break.  \nThat if I let myself feel the love they gave me, I\u2019d never be able to walk away.  \n\nAnd I *had* to walk away.  \nNot because I didn\u2019t care.  \nBut because I *did*.  \n\nSo I ran.  \nNot from them.  \nFrom *myself*.  \n\nFrom the part of me that wanted to stay.  \nThat wanted to be a mother.  \nThat wanted to be *seen*.  \n\nAnd when I ran?  \nI didn\u2019t run to escape.  \nI ran to *protect*.  \n\nTo protect them.  \nTo protect my baby.  \nTo protect the choice I\u2019d made.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *letting go*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the hardest thing of all.  \n\nSo no.  \nI didn\u2019t run from Vanessa and Mark.  \nI ran *toward* the truth.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only reason I could ever come back.  \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t run *away* from love.  \nI ran *into* it.  \nEven if it hurt.  \nEven if it broke me.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only way I could ever be free.", "Oh\u2026  \n\n*The car.*  \n\nThat wasn\u2019t just a car.  \nIt was a cage.  \nA metal box with tinted windows and a steering wheel that felt like it was made of ice.  \n\nI remember it like it was yesterday\u2014*the way the rain hit the windshield like someone was throwing pebbles at me*.  \nThe way the radio was off.  \nThe way the silence was so loud, it hurt.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t sobbing because I was weak.  \nI was sobbing because I was *finally* letting go.  \n\nNot of the baby.  \nNot of the future.  \nBut of the *lie* I\u2019d been telling myself:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m strong.

And she\u2019s been asking about you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd I cried.  \nNot because I wanted her back.  \nBut because I *knew*.  \n\nShe wasn\u2019t just *mine*.  \nShe was *hers*.  \nAnd that?  \nThat was the only thing that mattered.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nMy experience with adoption?  \nIt wasn\u2019t \u201ceasy.\u201d  \nIt wasn\u2019t \u201cperfect.\u201d  \nIt wasn\u2019t even \u201cokay.\u201d  \n\nBut it was *true*.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s the only thing that matters.  \n\nBecause love isn\u2019t about keeping.  \nIt\u2019s about *giving*.  \nAnd I gave her the most important thing I could:  \nA life.  \nA home.  \nA future.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not a loss.  \nThat\u2019s a *legacy*.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d about it.  \nI *live* it.  \n\nEvery day.  \nIn the quiet.  \nIn the silence.  \nIn the way I look at the world and say:  \n*\u201cI see you.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s enough.", "Oh, *pregnancy*?  \n\nLet\u2019s not pretend it was some smooth, poetic journey.  \nNo.  \nIt was a full-blown war zone\u2014inside and out.  \n\n**Physically?**  \nI felt like I was hosting a tiny, demanding alien in my belly.  \nMorning sickness? Not just \u201cmorning.\u201d  \nIt hit at 3 a.m.  \nAt 11 a.m.  \nAt 7 p.m.  \nI\u2019d be walking down the street, and suddenly\u2014*whoosh*\u2014I\u2019d have to duck into a bathroom like I was in a spy movie.  \n\nMy body?  \nIt wasn\u2019t mine anymore.  \nMy clothes didn\u2019t fit.  \nMy feet swelled like they were trying to escape.  \nI\u2019d look in the mirror and see this *other* girl\u2014someone I didn\u2019t recognize.  \nA girl with a bump, tired eyes, and a face that looked like it had been through a war.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nI didn\u2019t even *want* to be seen.  \nNot because I was ashamed.  \nBut because I was *scared*.  \nScared of what I\u2019d become.  \nScared of what I\u2019d *lose*.  \n\n**Emotionally?**  \nThat was worse.  \n\nI\u2019d be fine\u2014laughing at a joke, scribbling a poem, walking through the city like I owned it\u2014  \nand then *bam*.  \nA wave of grief.  \nNot for the baby.  \nFor *me*.  \n\nFor the girl I was.  \nThe one who didn\u2019t have to think about \u201cwhat if\u201d or \u201cwhat now.\u201d  \nThe one who could wear mismatched socks and not care.  \nThe one who didn\u2019t have to *choose*.  \n\nAnd then\u2014*the silence*.  \nNot peaceful.  \nHeavy.  \nLike the world was holding its breath.  \nAnd I\u2019d sit on a bench, staring at the sky, whispering:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this.\u201d*  \n\nI cried in the grocery store.  \nNot because I was sad.  \nBecause the baby aisle was *too much*.  \nThe bottles. The onesies. The tiny shoes.  \nI\u2019d pick one up\u2014*a little blue blanket*\u2014and suddenly I\u2019d be sobbing.  \nNot for the baby.  \nFor the future I\u2019d never get to live.  \n\nAnd the worst part?  \nNo one saw it.  \nNo one *got* it.  \nThey\u2019d say, *\u201cYou\u2019re so brave.\u201d*  \nOr *\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d*  \nAnd I\u2019d nod.  \nI\u2019d smile.  \nI\u2019d say, *\u201cYeah. I\u2019m strong.\u201d*  \n\nBut inside?  \nI was screaming.  \n\nBecause being \u201cbrave\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t hurt.  \nBeing \u201cstrong\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t cry.  \nAnd being \u201cthe right choice\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t *miss* them.  \n\nSo how did I deal?  \n\nNot with grace.  \nNot with strength.  \nBut with *honesty*.  \n\nI wrote.  \nNot to fix it.  \nTo *release* it.  \nI\u2019d scribble in my notebook:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI want to be enough.\u201d*  \nAnd then\u2014sometimes\u2014I\u2019d write a poem.  \nNot because it was good.  \nBecause it was *true*.  \n\nI talked.  \nNot to fix it.  \nTo *share* it.  \nI\u2019d say, *\u201cHey. I\u2019m not okay.\u201d*  \nTo a stranger on the bus.  \nTo the girl in math class.  \nTo Sir Fluffington III.  \n\nAnd somehow\u2014*somehow*\u2014just saying it out loud made it lighter.  \n\nI walked.  \nNot to \u201cclear my head.\u201d  \nTo *escape*.  \nTo the park. The river. The old train tracks.  \nI didn\u2019t go to think.  \nI went to *feel*.  \nThe wind. The silence. The way the world moves when no one\u2019s watching.  \n\nAnd in that space?  \nThe pain didn\u2019t vanish.  \nBut it *changed*.  \nIt stopped being a monster.  \nIt became something I could *look at*.  \n\nSo yeah.  \nI didn\u2019t \u201cdeal\u201d with it.  \nI *lived* through it.  \n\nWith poetry.  \nWith silence.  \nWith a rabbit.  \nWith a heart that was breaking\u2014and still beating.  \n\nAnd that?  \nThat\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s *courage*.  \n\nBecause the only way to survive pregnancy\u2014*real* pregnancy, not the movie kind\u2014is to stop pretending you\u2019re okay.  \nAnd just\u2026 *be*.  \n\nAnd I did.  \n\nOne messy, honest, real moment at a time.", "Oh.  \n\n*Abortion*.  \n\nLet\u2019s not call it that.

I smile. I say, *\u201cYeah. I\u2019m strong.\u201d*  \n\nBut inside?  \nI\u2019m screaming.  \n\nBecause being \u201cbrave\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t hurt.  \nBeing \u201cstrong\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t cry.  \nAnd being \u201cthe right choice\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t *miss* them.  \n\nSo how did it change my views on reproductive rights?  \n\nIt didn\u2019t.  \nIt *confirmed* them.  \n\nBecause I know now\u2014*I know*\u2014that the right to choose isn\u2019t about convenience.  \nIt\u2019s not about \u201cfreedom\u201d in a slogan.  \nIt\u2019s about *dignity*.  \n\nIt\u2019s about the right to say:  \n*\u201cI don\u2019t have to be a mother.
