Extensive neurological research has consistently shown that we utilize *all* of our brain.\n\nBrain imaging techniques, such as fMRI and PET scans, reveal activity throughout the entire brain, even during seemingly simple tasks.

Calculate the Area of the Triangular Base:**\n\nWe\u2019re given the base of the triangle as 9 meters. To find the area, we need the height of the triangle. However, we\u2019re only given the perpendicular height of the prism, which is 12 meters. We\u2019ll assume this is the height of the triangle as well.\n\nArea of Triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 9 * 12 = 54 square meters.\n\n**2. Calculate the Lateral Surface Area:**\n\nThe lateral surface area of a prism is the perimeter of the base multiplied by the height of the prism.\n\nPerimeter of the triangle = 9 + (two sides \u2013 we only know one side, so we\u2019ll call the other side \u2018s\u2019). We don\u2019t have enough information to determine \u2018s\u2019. Let\u2019s assume the triangle is isosceles, meaning the two sides are equal.  Therefore, the perimeter is 9 + s + s = 9 + 2s.\n\nLateral Surface Area = (9 + 2s) * 12 = 108 + 24s.\n\n**3. Calculate the Area of the Two Bases:**\n\nSince it\u2019s a triangular prism, we have two identical triangular bases.\n\nArea of Two Bases = 2 * 54 = 108 square meters.\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Surface Area:**\n\nTotal Surface Area = Lateral Surface Area + Area of Two Bases\n\nTotal Surface Area = (108 + 24s) + 108 = 216 + 24s\n\n**However, we need to make an assumption to proceed. Since we only know one side of the triangle, let's assume the triangle is equilateral. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.**\n\nTherefore, s = 9 meters.\n\nSubstituting s = 9 into the equation for the Lateral Surface Area:\n\nLateral Surface Area = (9 + 2*9) * 12 = (9 + 18) * 12 = 27 * 12 = 324 square meters.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Surface Area (with the equilateral assumption):**\n\nTotal Surface Area = 216 + 24 * 9 = 216 + 216 = 432 square meters.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe total surface area of the triangular prism is **432.0 square meters**.\n\n(I pause, a slow, deliberate movement.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably straightforward calculation.

Let\u2019s dissect this with a degree of\u2026 analytical precision.)\n\nThis is a classic geometric problem \u2013 a variation on the concept of a bisector. The key to minimizing the maximum distance is to find the line that is equidistant from both original lines. That line is the angle bisector of the angle formed by the two given lines.\n\nHere\u2019s how to solve it:\n\n**1. Find the slopes of the lines:**\n\n*   **Line 1:** The slope (m1) is (5-1)/(5-1) = 4/4 = 1.\n*   **Line 2:** The slope (m2) is (-2-3)/(-2-3) = -5/-5 = 1.\n\nNotice that both lines have the same slope! This means the lines are parallel.\n\n**2. The Bisector:**\n\nSince the lines are parallel and have the same slope, the angle bisector is a line perpendicular to both of them. Therefore, the slope of the bisector (m3) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of either line.  Since m1 = 1, m3 = -1.\n\n**3. Equation of the Bisector:**\n\nWe know the slope of the bisector (m3 = -1) and a point on the bisector. Let\u2019s use the midpoint of the segment connecting the points (1,1) and (5,5). The midpoint is ((1+5)/2, (1+5)/2) = (3, 3).\n\nUsing the point-slope form of a line: y - y1 = m(x - x1), we get:\n\ny - 3 = -1(x - 3)\ny - 3 = -x + 3\ny = -x + 6\n\n**4. The Answer:**\n\nThe line segment connecting the points where the original lines intersect is defined by the equation y = -x + 6.\n\n**In simpler terms:** The line that minimizes the maximum distance from any point on either line to the new line segment is a line with a slope of -1 that passes through the midpoint of the segment connecting the points (1,1) and (5,5).\n\n(I pause, a slow, deliberate movement.)\n\nIt\u2019s a remarkably straightforward solution, given the complexity of the problem.

Sets are incredibly efficient for checking if an element already exists because they provide near-instantaneous lookups.\n\n2.  **`result = []`:** We initialize an empty list called `result` to store the unique strings.\n\n3.  **`for string in strings:`:** We iterate through the input list `strings`.\n\n4.  **`if string not in seen:`:** For each string, we check if it\u2019s already present in the `seen` set.\n\n5.  **`seen.add(string)`:** If the string is *not* in the `seen` set (meaning it\u2019s a new, unique string), we add it to the set.\n\n6.  **`result.append(string)`:** We also append the string to the `result` list.\n\n7.  **`return result`:** Finally, we return the `result` list, which now contains only the unique strings in their original order.\n\nThis approach is efficient because set lookups (checking if an element is in a set) have an average time complexity of O(1) (constant time).  The overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.
