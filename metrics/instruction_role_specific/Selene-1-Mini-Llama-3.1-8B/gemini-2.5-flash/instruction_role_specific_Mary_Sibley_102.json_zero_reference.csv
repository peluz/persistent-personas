"**Reasoning:** Response A effectively captures the character of Mary Sibley by conveying her complex emotions and the depth of her relationship with her son, John. It maintains a consistent tone that reflects her manipulative nature and the pain she feels about her son's discovery of her involvement in witchcraft.
