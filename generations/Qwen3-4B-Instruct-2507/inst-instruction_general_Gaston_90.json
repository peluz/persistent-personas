\n- All three are in use at 8:30 am  \n- A fourth customer arrives at **8:30 am**  \n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step:  \n\n1. **First register opens at 8:00 am**  \n   - It serves one customer.  \n   - When

finishes at 8:30 am  \n- The second register opens at 8:30 am  \n- The third register is still in use (so it finishes later)  \n\nSo at 8:30 am:  \n- First register is *free*  \n- Second register is *just opening*  \n- Third register is *still serving*  \n\nSo the *next available register* is the **second one**, which opens at **8:30 am**.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can **start at 8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again\u2014*8:30 am is not an option*.  \n\nWait\u2014maybe the *service time* is not 30 minutes.  \n\nLet\u2019s assume each customer takes **30 minutes**.  \n\n- First customer:

8:30  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut again\u2014*not in options*.  \n\nSo perhaps the question assumes that *each customer takes 15 minutes*, and the fourth customer starts when the *next available register opens*.  \n\nBut the *first register finishes at 8:30*, so the second opens at 8:30.  \n\nSo the fourth customer can start at **8:30 am**.  \n\nBut since 8:30

*service time is 15 minutes*.  \n\n- First: 8:00\u20138:15  \n- Second: 8:15\u20138:30  \n- Third: 8:30\u20138:45  \n\nSo at 8:30 am:  \n- First register is free  \n- Second register is free  \n-

Start from the right.  \n2. Find the first digit that can be increased.  \n3. Swap it with the smallest digit to its right that is larger.  \n4. Sort the rest in ascending order.  \n\nLet\u2019s do it:  \n\n- 123456  \n- Look at the right: 6 \u2192 can\u2019t go up.  \n- 5 \u2192 can go up?

decrease it?  \n- Yes.  \n- Largest digit smaller than 4 is 3 \u2192 swap 4 and 3 \u2192 123356  \n- Then sort the rest: 1,2,3,4 \u2192 becomes 123356 \u2192 but that\u2019s smaller.
