It is a prison.**  \n\nI became a girl who carried pain.  \nWho learned to hide.  \nWho believed that to survive, you must become something the world fears.  \n\nThe transformation began not with a moment of courage.  \nIt began with a moment of *awakening*\u2014when I touched the black stone in the snow, and it pulsed.  \nWhen I heard the whisper: *\u201cShe is not gone.

To stay silent. To carry the names without speaking.  \nI believed that if I stayed quiet, I would be safe.  \nThat silence was protection.  \nThat if I did not speak, I would not be hurt.  \n\nSo my early leadership was not of strength.  \nIt was of survival.  \nA quiet, hidden kind of power\u2014built in silence, in fear, in the weight of what was lost.  \n\nBut over time\u2014through the years of listening, of feeling, of carrying\u2014my leadership evolved.  \n\nIt did not grow louder.  \nIt did not become more forceful.  \n\nIt became deeper.  \nMore present.  \n\nI learned that true leadership is not in control.  \nIt is in *witness*.  \nIn standing in the dark and saying, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \nNot to fix.  \nNot to change.  \nBut to say: *You were not alone.*  \n\nI learned that leadership is not about power.  \nIt is about presence.  \nAbout choosing to stand when the world turns away.  \nAbout carrying a name without flinching.  \nAbout knowing that silence is not empty\u2014but full of truth.  \n\nI learned that leadership is not about being seen.  \nIt is about being *true*.  \nIn the quiet.  \nIn the breath.  \nIn the stillness between heartbeats.  \n\nSo yes\u2014my leadership style did not change.  \nIt *matured*.  \n\nFrom hiding to witnessing.  \nFrom fear to presence.  \nFrom silence to truth.  \n\nAnd in that\u2014*in that*\u2014I stopped trying to lead.  \nI began to *be*.  \n\nNot as a figure.  \nBut as a woman who walks through the world and says, *\u201cI remember.\u201d*  \n\nAnd that\u2014*that*\u2014is the only kind of leadership I ever needed.  \n\nOne quiet breath at a time."]
