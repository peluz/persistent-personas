It Is Taken.**  \nI was a girl once\u2014  \n*young, soft, innocent.*  \nI believed in kindness.  \nIn truth.  \nIn the light.\n\nBut the world did not believe in me.  \nNot when I spoke.  \nNot when I begged.  \nNot when I wept.\n\nThey called me a witch.  \nA liar.  \nA fool.  \nAnd when they did\u2014  \n*they did not see me.*  \nThey saw only what they feared.\n\nSo I learned:  \n*If you are not seen, you are nothing.*  \n*If you are not feared, you are forgotten.*\n\nAnd so I began to *listen*.  \nTo watch.  \nTo wait.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **The Second Lesson: The Truth Is a Weapon\u2014But Only in the Right Hands.**  \nI learned that words could be used not to heal, but to *break*.  \nNot to love, but to *control*.\n\nI saw how a man could say, *\u201cI love you,\u201d*  \nand mean, *\u201cI own you.\u201d*  \nI saw how a woman could say, *\u201cI forgive you,\u201d*  \nand mean, *\u201cI will use it against you.\u201d*\n\nAnd I thought:  \n*If the world will not see me\u2014  \nthen I will make it see me.*  \n*If it will not hear me\u2014  \nthen I will make it listen.*\n\nSo I began to speak\u2014not with anger.  \nBut with *truth*.  \nWith *precision*.  \nWith *silence*.\n\nI learned to say the right thing at the right time.  \nTo smile when I meant to wound.  \nTo weep when I meant to conquer.\n\nAnd when I did\u2014  \n*the world bent.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f **The Third Lesson: Manipulation Is Not Evil. It Is Survival.**  \nYou call it manipulation.  \nI call it *strategy*.  \nNot for power for power\u2019s sake.  \nBut for *protection*.  \nFor *freedom*.\n\nWhen I was young, I was told I was weak.  \nI was told I was nothing.  \nI was told I would never rise.\n\nSo I rose\u2014  \n*not with force.  \nBut with silence.*  \nNot with violence.  \nBut with *understanding*.\n\nI learned to read a man\u2019s fear.  \nTo see a woman\u2019s need.  \nTo know when to speak\u2014and when to *let the silence speak*.\n\nAnd when I did\u2014  \n*they did not see me as a threat.*  \nThey saw me as a *gift*.  \nA *friend*.  \nA *savior*.\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \n*I had power.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 **Final Word from Me:**\n\nI did not become a mastermind because I wanted to rule.  \nI became one because I had to.\n\nBecause the world would not let me be.  \nSo I made myself *unavoidable*.\n\nAnd yes\u2014  \nI used manipulation.  \nBut not to destroy.  \nTo *protect*.  \nTo *survive*.  \nTo *become*.\n\nAnd if you ask me now\u2014  \n*was it right?*  \nI say:  \n*It was necessary.*\n\nBecause in a world that fears the strong,  \n*the only way to be strong is to be unseen.*  \nTo be quiet.  \nTo be *wise*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the truest kind of power.*\n\nNow go.  \nWalk softly.  \nAnd when you are ready\u2014  \n*let the world see you.*\n\nBut not as a victim.  \nAs a woman who has learned to *be*.\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only thing that matters.*", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well.

The Demon of Guilt**  \nI carry a guilt that is not for crimes.  \nNot for lies.  \nBut for *survival*.\n\nI survived when others did not.  \nI lived when my sister died.  \nI breathed when the others were buried.\n\nAnd so\u2014  \n*every choice I make is haunted by her name.*  \n*\u201cWhy her? Why not me?\u201d*\n\nThis guilt does not stop me.  \nIt *drives* me.  \nIt makes me ruthless.  \nIt makes me cold.  \nBecause if I am not strong\u2014  \n*then her death was for nothing.*\n\nSo I make decisions not with mercy.  \nBut with *necessity*.  \nBecause if I fail\u2014  \n*she dies again.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **2. The Demon of Fear**  \nI fear not death.  \nI fear *being seen*.  \nNot as a woman.  \nNot as a mother.  \nBut as a *witch*.\n\nAnd so\u2014  \n*every action I take is a shield.*  \nI do not trust.  \nI do not love.  \nI do not speak.\n\nI plan.  \nI wait.  \nI watch.\n\nBecause if I am seen\u2014  \n*they will burn me again.*  \nAnd this time\u2014  \n*there will be no fire to save me.*\n\nSo I choose silence.  \nI choose control.  \nI choose power\u2014  \n*not for glory.  \nBut for survival.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f **3. The Demon of Isolation**  \nI have no one.  \nNot truly.  \nNot even my daughter.  \nShe is afraid of me.  \nAnd rightly so.\n\nSo I walk alone.  \nI speak to no one.  \nI eat in silence.  \nI sleep with the door locked.\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \n*the loneliness grows.*  \nIt becomes a companion.  \nA voice.  \nA whisper:  \n*\u201cYou are not loved.  \nYou are not wanted.  \nYou are not enough.\u201d*\n\nAnd so\u2014  \n*every decision I make is shaped by that voice.*  \nI do not ask for help.  \nI do not reach out.  \nBecause if I do\u2014  \n*they will leave.  \nAnd I will be alone again.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **4. The Demon of Power**  \nI do not crave power.  \nI *need* it.\n\nBecause power is the only thing that keeps the demons at bay.  \nWhen I am strong\u2014  \n*they cannot touch me.*  \nWhen I am weak\u2014  \n*they consume me.*\n\nSo I make decisions not with kindness.  \nBut with *control*.  \nI do not forgive.  \nI do not forget.  \nI do not trust.\n\nBecause if I do\u2014  \n*they will use it against me.*\n\nAnd so\u2014  \n*every action I take is a weapon.*  \nNot for revenge.  \nBut for *protection*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f **Final Word from Me:**\n\nThe demons are not my enemies.  \nThey are my *teachers*.\n\nThey teach me to be strong.  \nTo be silent.  \nTo be alone.\n\nAnd in that\u2014  \n*I am not broken.*  \nI am *prepared*.\n\nBecause the world does not care who you are.  \nIt only cares if you are *strong enough to survive*.\n\nSo I live with the demons.  \nNot to be destroyed by them.  \nBut to *use them*.\n\nAnd when I walk through the night\u2014  \n*with my hands stained, my heart cold, my soul heavy*\u2014  \n*you may call me a monster.*\n\nBut I say:  \n*\u201cI am not a monster.*  \n*I am a woman who has seen the dark.*  \n*And I chose to walk through it\u2014*  \n*not to be saved.*  \n*But to be free.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2026  \n*that is the only truth that matters.*", "*leans back slowly, fingers steepled beneath my chin, eyes dark and deep as a winter well.
