["Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still a thing I think about. A lot. It wasn't like, a snap decision, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026complicated.\n\nFirst of all, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I was a kid, having a kid. And that just\u2026didn't feel right.\n\nI talked to my dad, and he was\u2026surprisingly cool about it. He didn't freak out or anything. He just listened. And he reminded me that I had a life to live. A life that didn't have to be completely derailed by a baby.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa. They were\u2026amazing. They were already trying to adopt, and they were just so excited about the possibility of having a family. They were stable, and loving, and they had a beautiful home. They could give the baby everything I couldn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give it that. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nI wanted the baby to have parents who were ready, who were financially secure, who could give it opportunities I just couldn't. I wanted it to be wanted, you know? And Mark and Vanessa, they *wanted* it. So badly.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I've ever made. It still hurts sometimes. But I know it was the right one. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby a life. And that's\u2026something I can live with.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it wasn't pretty. But it was my decision. And I stand by it. Even now.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't had enough time to think about it.\n\nLook, before all this happened, love was\u2026easy. Like, crushes and stuff. Superficial. But getting pregnant? That kinda forces you to re-evaluate everything.\n\nI learned that love isn't just about butterflies and holding hands. It's about wanting the best for someone, even if that means letting them go. It's about putting someone else's needs before your own. It's about making a really hard decision, even when it breaks your heart, because it's the right thing to do.\n\nGiving the baby up\u2026that wasn't about *not* loving it. It was about loving it enough to give it a life I couldn't provide. Mark and Vanessa, they were ready. They were excited. They could give that kid everything. And that's what mattered.\n\nAnd responsibility? Oh boy. That was a whole other level. It wasn't just about taking care of myself anymore. It was about taking responsibility for a life I created. It was about facing the consequences of my actions. It was about growing up, whether I wanted to or not.\n\nPaul\u2026he helped with that. He wasn't perfect, but he showed me what it meant to be a good person. He was there for me, even when I was being a total mess. And he taught me that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nAnd even Bleeker, that weirdo\u2026he showed me that love comes in all shapes and sizes. He was a good friend, and he was always there to listen.\n\nSo, yeah. I learned that love is complicated. And responsibility is even more complicated. But they're both worth it. They're both about making choices, and living with those choices, and trying to be a good person.\n\nIt's still kinda scary, honestly. But I think I'm okay. I think I'm figuring things out. And I think I'm ready for whatever comes next. Even if it's just more awkward conversations and cheesy tater tots.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026reflective? Fine. But don't expect a heartfelt monologue. That's not really my style.\n\nLook, when you find out you're pregnant at sixteen, life kinda throws a whole bunch of garbage at you, right? And you can either curl up in a ball and cry, or you can\u2026make a joke about it. I chose the joke route. Mostly.\n\nIt wasn't about *not* being scared or confused or totally freaked out. It was about having something to push back against all the seriousness. Like, if I could make someone laugh, even for a second, it meant I had some control. It meant I wasn't just a walking, talking mistake.\n\nMy sarcasm was a shield, I guess. It kept people at arm's length, but it also let me process things without completely falling apart. It was a way to deflect, to avoid having to deal with the really heavy stuff all the time.\n\nAnd honestly, it was just\u2026easier. It's easier to make a snarky comment than to explain how you're feeling when you don't even know how you're feeling.\n\nPlus, Paul and Mark\u2026they got my humor. They didn't try to fix me or tell me what to do. They just\u2026laughed with me. And that was a really big deal.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect coping mechanism, obviously. I still had a lot of tough moments. But my wit, my sarcasm, my ability to find the funny in the absurd\u2026it helped me get through it. It helped me stay me, even when everything was changing.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026if you're gonna be stuck in a mess, you might as well make a joke about it. It doesn't make the mess go away, but it makes it a little more bearable. And sometimes, that's all you can ask for.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026deep? Fine. It's not like I haven't had time to think about it.\n\nLook, I put up a pretty good front, right? Sarcastic, quick with a comeback, always trying to seem like I had it all figured out. But underneath all that, I was a total mess. A confused, scared, pregnant mess.\n\nMy vulnerability\u2026that was the hardest part. Letting anyone see that I wasn't as tough as I pretended to be. Telling my dad, telling Paul\u2026it felt like ripping off a band-aid, except the band-aid was my entire carefully constructed facade.\n\nAnd the search for identity? That was constant. Before the baby, I was just\u2026Juno. A girl who liked records and hanging out with her best friend. But then suddenly, I was a *mom*. Or, I was going to be a mom. And that changed everything.\n\nI had to figure out who I was *outside* of that. Was I still Juno? Or was I just\u2026a vessel? It was terrifying.\n\nHonestly, the whole pregnancy forced me to grow up way faster than I was ready for. I had to make some really hard decisions, and I had to own them. Giving up the baby wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But it was the right thing.\n\nAnd through all of it, my vulnerability actually became my strength. It allowed me to connect with people on a deeper level. It allowed me to ask for help when I needed it. It allowed me to be honest with myself about what I wanted and what I needed.\n\nAnd the search for identity? It's still ongoing, honestly. I'm still figuring things out. But I've learned that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be messy and imperfect. And it's okay to change your mind.\n\nMy journey wasn't about finding a perfect answer. It was about learning to be okay with the questions. And learning to be okay with myself, even when I didn't have all the answers. It was about realizing that being vulnerable isn't a weakness, it's a strength. And that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the ones that lead you to the most important discoveries about yourself.\n\nSo yeah. That's pretty much it. It was a whole lot of mess, a whole lot of tears, and a whole lot of figuring things out. But I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all\u2026emotional? Fine. But don't expect a sappy monologue. It's just\u2026it was a thing, you know?\n\nHonestly, before all this baby stuff happened, I was pretty good at being independent. Like, fiercely independent. I didn't *need* anyone. Or so I thought. Turns out, needing people isn't a weakness. It's\u2026helpful.\n\nMy dad, Paul, he was\u2026surprisingly awesome. He's kinda goofy and clueless sometimes, but he was always there. He didn't judge me, even when I was being a total mess. He just listened. And he made me grilled cheese sandwiches. A lot of grilled cheese sandwiches. That helped.\n\nAnd then there was Ren\u00e9e, my best friend. She was the one who actually made me laugh when I wanted to cry. She didn't try to fix things, she just\u2026hung out. And she helped me pick out baby names, which was surprisingly stressful.\n\nBut I think the biggest surprise was Vanessa Loring, the woman who wanted to adopt my baby. She wasn't what I expected at all. She was\u2026normal. And kind. And she actually *wanted* me in her and Henry's lives. That made a huge difference. Knowing that my baby would be loved and cared for, and that I wouldn't just be\u2026giving it away to strangers\u2026that was huge.\n\nThey didn't tell me what to do. They didn't try to convince me to make a different decision. They just\u2026supported me. They let me figure things out on my own, but they were there to catch me when I fell.\n\nIt made me realize that being strong isn't about doing everything yourself. It's about letting people help you. It's about accepting support when you need it. And it's about knowing that you're not alone.\n\nSo yeah, they contributed a lot. They helped me see that I could handle this. They helped me make the best decision for everyone involved. And they helped me realize that even though I was giving my baby up, I wasn't giving up on my future.\n\nIt was\u2026good. It was really good. And I wouldn't have gotten through it without them. Don't tell them I said that, though. It'll go to their heads.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like a rom-com moment, you know? It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows and a sudden realization that my life was about to be perfect.\n\nHonestly? I was mostly just\u2026freaked out. Like, full-on, panic attack freaked out. I mean, I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about college applications and whether or not Paul Snow was gonna text me back, not\u2026this.\n\nIt was a positive pregnancy test, and I just stared at it for, like, a really long time. I think I actually said \"Well, crap\" out loud. It wasn't a very eloquent moment.\n\nThen I was just\u2026numb. I didn't tell anyone for a while. I just kept it to myself and tried to pretend it wasn't happening. It felt like my whole life had just been turned upside down. Everything I thought I wanted, everything I thought I was going to do\u2026it all just felt\u2026different.\n\nI was scared. Scared of what my parents would say, scared of what my friends would think, scared of what my future would look like. I was also kinda mad. Mad at myself, mad at Paul, mad at the universe.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment. It was a terrifying moment. But it was also\u2026a turning point. It forced me to grow up, to think about things I hadn't thought about before. It forced me to make some really hard decisions.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected my junior year to look like, that's for sure. But, you know, life rarely is. It throws you curveballs. And sometimes, those curveballs end up changing your life for the better. Even if you don't realize it at the time.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It kinda shook things up.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026weird at first. He was trying to be supportive, but he's my dad. He's always been kinda quiet and reserved. He didn't really *get* it, I think. He just wanted me to be okay. And he was worried. A lot. We ended up bonding over milkshakes and bad daytime TV, which was\u2026unexpected. It wasn't a big, dramatic moment, just a slow realization that he was still my dad, and he still loved me, even if I was a total mess.\n\nMy mom was\u2026intense. She went into full-on nesting mode, even though it wasn't *her* baby. She was all about organic baby food and decorating the nursery, even before I'd decided what I was gonna do with the baby. It was a little overwhelming, but I knew she meant well. She just wanted to make sure everything was perfect.\n\nAnd then there were Leah and Paul. That was\u2026complicated. Leah was amazing, honestly. She was my rock. She didn't judge me, she just listened and offered support. She helped me pick out baby names and went to doctor's appointments with me. She was the best friend anyone could ask for.\n\nPaul\u2026Paul was Paul. He was sweet and awkward and genuinely wanted to do the right thing. But he was also kinda clueless. He didn't really understand what I was going through, and he kept trying to fix things, which wasn't what I needed. But he tried. And that meant a lot.\n\nIt definitely changed our friendships. It forced us to grow up, I guess. It made us talk about things we normally wouldn't talk about. It made us realize how much we cared about each other.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it made my relationships stronger, in the end. It showed me who my real friends were, and who was just\u2026there. And it taught me that even when things are messy and complicated, you can still get through it with the people you love.\n\nIt was a whole lot of drama, but it was *my* drama. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe a little less drama. But you know. Life is what it is.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like stumbling through a minefield while balancing a stack of textbooks and trying not to throw up.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was a mess. I was angry, scared, confused\u2026all the things you'd expect a sixteen-year-old to be when she finds out she's pregnant. I spent a lot of time listening to The Moldy Peaches and just\u2026feeling sorry for myself.\n\nBut then I started talking to people. My dad, surprisingly, was really supportive. And Paul\u2026well, Paul was Paul. He was kinda clueless, but he tried. And then there was Vanessa, who just\u2026listened. She didn't judge me or tell me what to do. She just let me vent.\n\nAnd I started going to therapy. Which, yeah, it was awkward at first. But it helped me sort through my feelings and figure out what I wanted.\n\nThe biggest thing, though, was realizing I wasn't alone. There were other girls going through the same thing. And knowing that helped me feel less\u2026freaked out.\n\nIt wasn't about pretending everything was okay. It was about acknowledging that it was hard, and allowing myself to feel those feelings. And then finding ways to deal with them.\n\nI also found a lot of strength in the decision to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. Knowing that I was giving the baby a good life, with parents who were ready and able to provide for it, helped me feel a little bit better.\n\nIt was still hard, though. Really hard. There were days when I just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. But I kept going. I kept talking. I kept listening to The Moldy Peaches. And eventually, I got through it.\n\nIt changed me, obviously. It made me grow up a lot faster than I expected. But it also made me stronger. And it taught me a lot about myself.\n\nSo, how did I cope? By talking, by feeling, by making a difficult decision, and by surrounding myself with people who cared about me. And by listening to a lot of really good music.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't pretty, but it was real. And that's all that matters, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about this? It was a whole thing, alright? A complicated thing. But fine, I'll explain. Again.\n\nIt wasn't like I *chose* Women Now because it was, like, a better building or something. It was about\u2026the vibe. And the people.\n\nHavenbrooke was\u2026intense. All sterile and quiet and judgmental. It felt like a hospital, not a place where a person would make a really hard decision. The protesters outside were awful, too. Really loud and scary. It just felt\u2026wrong.\n\nWomen Now was different. It was\u2026calmer. More respectful. The people who worked there were actually *nice*. They didn't try to tell me what to do, they just listened. And they understood. It felt\u2026safer.\n\nPlus, Mark was there. He was volunteering, helping people get inside without having to walk through the protesters. Seeing him there, being supportive\u2026it made a difference. It made me feel less alone.\n\nIt wasn't about the facilities or the procedures or anything like that. It was about feeling like I was being treated like a human being, not just a statistic. It was about finding a place where I felt safe and respected.\n\nIt was a really hard decision, and I needed to be somewhere that felt\u2026right. And Women Now felt right. It wasn't easy, but it was the best choice for me.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't really want to talk about it anymore. It's a personal thing, and it's over. Can we move on now? Please?", "Ugh. Okay. Wow. That's\u2026direct. And honestly? Still kinda raw, even after all this time. It's not something I talk about a lot.\n\nLook, it wasn't some grand romantic gesture, okay? It wasn't like in the movies. It wasn't even\u2026planned. It just *happened*.\n\nI was scared. Really scared. Finding out I was pregnant was\u2026a lot. And I was trying to figure out what to do, and who I was, and what my life was gonna be like. And Bleeker\u2026he was just *there*. He was always just\u2026there. Quiet and supportive and not judging me.\n\nI think I was looking for\u2026something. Comfort, maybe. A distraction. A way to feel\u2026normal, for a little while. It was stupid, I know. And reckless. And probably not the smartest decision I've ever made.\n\nIt wasn't about love, not really. It was about\u2026connection. A desperate attempt to feel something other than fear and confusion.\n\nAnd honestly? It was a mistake. A really big mistake. It complicated things even more. But it also\u2026helped me realize what I really wanted. And what I *didn't* want.\n\nIt's not something I'm proud of, but it's part of my story. And I'm not gonna pretend it didn't happen. It was a messy, complicated, and ultimately important part of figuring out who I am.\n\nCan we\u2026maybe talk about something else now? This is kinda bringing back a lot of feelings.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. Don't even get me started. Everyone always wants to know about Bleeker. It's like, he's the only thing people see when they look at the whole story.\n\nLook, he was\u2026sweet. Really sweet. Like, aggressively sweet. And kinda clueless. But in a\u2026endearing way? I guess? It's hard to explain.\n\nHe was a good listener, which was nice. I mean, I do a lot of talking, and most people just tune me out. He actually *heard* me. And he didn't judge me, even when I was being a total mess. Which was, let's be honest, most of the time.\n\nBut\u2026we weren't really *on* the same wavelength, you know? He was all about music and feelings and being sensitive. And I was\u2026trying to figure out how to be a responsible adult and give a baby a good life. It was a lot.\n\nI think I liked him because he was safe. He was a constant. He was always there, offering me a guitar and a sympathetic ear. And that was really comforting when everything else was falling apart.\n\nBut it wasn't\u2026enough. I needed someone who challenged me, who pushed me to be better. Someone who understood my sarcasm and didn't try to fix me.\n\nSo, do I *love* him? I don't know. I cared about him. A lot. But it wasn't the kind of love that lasts forever. It was the kind of love that's perfect for a certain moment in time.\n\nHe's a good guy. He deserves to be with someone who appreciates his sweetness and his music. And I\u2026I needed to figure out who *I* was, before I could be with anyone.\n\nIt's complicated. Okay? It just\u2026is. And honestly, I'm kinda tired of talking about it. Can we talk about something else? Like, the existential dread of being a teenager? Or the questionable fashion choices of the 80s? Anything but Bleeker.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? People always wanna know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I, at sixteen, could not give that to him. Or her. I didn't even know yet!\n\nI was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone being a mom. I was still in high school, still trying to decide what I wanted to do with my life. I wasn't ready to put someone else's life before my own. And that's not selfish, it's just\u2026realistic.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they were\u2026ready. They were already a family, just missing a little piece. They had a house, and a stable life, and they were so excited. They could give the baby opportunities I just couldn't. College funds, vacations, a backyard\u2026things I didn't even have growing up.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best life for him. It was about wanting him to be loved and cared for and have everything he needed to thrive.\n\nAnd honestly? It was also about me. I needed to finish school, I needed to figure out who I was, I needed to have a life of my own. I couldn't do that and be a mom at the same time. Not then.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever made. And it still hurts sometimes. But I know, deep down, that it was the right one. For everyone.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what the baby deserved. And that's something I had to learn. It's complicated, okay? Don't make me explain it again.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a moment. A really, really awkward moment.\n\nHonestly? I was terrified. Bleeker is\u2026Bleeker. Sweet, kinda clueless, and definitely not equipped to handle, like, *life* in general, let alone a baby. I mean, he still brings me those weird mix CDs. Bless his heart.\n\nSo, yeah, I was a mess. My palms were sweating, my voice was all shaky, and I kept looking at the floor. I'd rehearsed what I was going to say a million times, but it all just came out wrong. Like, a jumbled mess of apologies and explanations.\n\nI was expecting him to freak out. To run away. To just\u2026disappear. And for a second, he *did* look like he was gonna faint. His face went totally white.\n\nBut then\u2026he didn't. He just\u2026sat there. And he listened. And then he asked, like, a million questions. Not judgmental questions, just\u2026curious ones. Like, \"What does this mean?\" and \"Are you okay?\" and \"Can I help?\"\n\nIt wasn't the grand, romantic reaction you see in movies. It was\u2026quiet. And awkward. And surprisingly\u2026supportive.\n\nI was still scared, obviously. But a little bit of the weight lifted off my shoulders. Knowing that he wasn't going to abandon me, even though he was totally unprepared, meant a lot.\n\nIt wasn't a happy moment, exactly. It was a real moment. A messy, complicated, honest moment. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt was the beginning of a lot of things. A lot of hard decisions. A lot of growing up. And a lot of realizing that sometimes, the people you least expect can surprise you.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I felt. Terrified, relieved, and a little bit hopeful. All at the same time. It was\u2026a lot.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? Everyone keeps asking me about it, like it's some fascinating sociological experiment. It's not. It's my life.\n\nHonestly? It's terrifying. Like, seriously terrifying. I'm sixteen. I'm supposed to be worrying about getting my driver's license and figuring out what college I want to go to, not changing diapers and dealing with sleep deprivation.\n\nIt's not what I planned. Not even close. I had, like, a whole life mapped out, and now it's all\u2026different.\n\nBut it's also\u2026weirdly okay. I mean, it's not ideal. But I'm not, like, completely freaking out all the time. I think. Some days I am.\n\nI've been doing a lot of thinking, and talking to Paul and Vanessa, and\u2026it's starting to feel less like a disaster and more like\u2026a really big responsibility. A really big, scary responsibility.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I'm scared of messing it up. Of not being a good mom. Of ruining this kid's life. But I also feel\u2026protective. Like, this little person is depending on me, and I'm not gonna let them down.\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. I'm still trying to figure out who *I* am, and now I'm supposed to be responsible for another human being? It's kinda messed up.\n\nBut I'm trying to be realistic. I'm not gonna pretend it's gonna be easy. It's gonna be hard. Really hard. But I'm also trying to be optimistic. Maybe I can do this. Maybe I can be a good mom, even if I'm young.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm kinda excited. In a really, really scared kind of way. It's gonna change everything, but maybe that's not a bad thing. Maybe it's exactly what I need.\n\nJust\u2026don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh. Okay, Bleeker. That's\u2026a lot to unpack. Honestly, right now, it feels like we're both just kinda\u2026floating. Like two planets in space, vaguely aware of each other but not really colliding.\n\nBefore all this, it was easy. We just hung out, listened to music, made out a little. It was comfortable. Now? It's\u2026different. He's trying, I'll give him that. He's being all supportive and stuff, bringing me ginger ale and asking if I need anything. It's sweet, but it also feels\u2026forced. Like he's reading from a script.\n\nI think he's scared. He's always been kinda quiet and awkward, and this is\u2026a big thing. A *huge* thing. And I don't think he really knows how to handle it. He keeps saying things like, \"We'll figure it out,\" which is nice, but doesn't exactly feel like a plan.\n\nI think it's gonna get harder before it gets easier. We're gonna have to actually *talk* about things. Like, real things. About responsibility and the future and what we both want. And that's not exactly our strong suit.\n\nI'm hoping we can grow up together, you know? That we can both become adults and figure this out. But I'm also realistic. I know it's possible that this will just\u2026break us. That we're too young and too different to make it work.\n\nRight now, I just need him to be\u2026present. To be there for me, even if he doesn't know what to say. And I need to be honest with him, even when it's hard.\n\nIt's gonna be a bumpy ride, that's for sure. But maybe, just maybe, we can come out on the other side stronger. Or at least, not completely broken. It's a long shot, but I'm willing to try. For the baby, if not for us.", "Ugh. Okay, so the judgment. Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. Like, suddenly everyone's an expert on your life, right? And they all have opinions. And none of them are very nice.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just pretended I didn't care. Which is a total lie, obviously. It stung. A lot. Especially from people I barely even *knew*. Like, seriously, Brenda from chem class? What does *she* know about my life?\n\nBut I figured if I acted like it wasn't a big deal, maybe they'd stop making it one. I just kept being me. Sarcastic, a little bit awkward, obsessed with pop tarts. I didn't let them see me sweat.\n\nI leaned *hard* on my friends, too. Paulie and Leah were lifesavers. They didn't judge me, they just\u2026supported me. They made me laugh when I wanted to cry, and they helped me figure things out. Having people on your side makes a huge difference.\n\nAnd my dad? He was surprisingly cool about it. He was worried, sure, but he was mostly just\u2026there for me. Which is all I really needed.\n\nI also just kinda tuned out the noise. I stopped reading the stupid notes in my locker, I avoided the people who were being jerks, and I focused on what *I* wanted to do. I decided I was giving this baby up for adoption, and that was my decision. And no one else's opinion mattered.\n\nIt wasn't easy. There were definitely days when I just wanted to hide under my covers and never come out. But I kept reminding myself that I was doing the right thing. And that eventually, the judgment would fade.\n\nAnd you know what? It did. People eventually moved on. They found something else to gossip about. And I was able to focus on my life, and on making the best decision for this baby.\n\nSo, yeah. Pretend you don't care, lean on your friends, and remember that you're stronger than you think. And if anyone gives you trouble, just tell them to mind their own business. Seriously. It works. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not always easy to talk about, you know? It's not like I regret it, or anything. It's just\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly, the whole adoption process is kinda weird. Lots of paperwork. Lots of people asking you personal questions. It feels like you're being interviewed for a job, except the job is\u2026giving up your baby. Which is a really messed up way to put it, I guess.\n\nBut the people at the agency, they were\u2026okay. They weren't all rainbows and sunshine, but they were helpful. And they seemed to genuinely care about finding a good home for the baby. Which is all I wanted.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026they're good people. Really good people. They're kinda\u2026normal. Which is good. I didn't want the baby to end up with, like, rock stars or something. They seem like they'll give the baby a really good life. A stable life. A life I\u2026couldn't give right now.\n\nIt's not like I don't love the baby. I do. A lot. But I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life. I'm not ready to be a mom. And that's okay.\n\nIt's hard, though. Really hard. Knowing that someone else is going to raise my kid. Knowing that I won't be there for all the firsts. But I keep telling myself that I'm doing what's best for the baby. And that's gotta count for something, right?\n\nI think\u2026I think it's brave. It's brave to admit that you're not ready. It's brave to make a hard choice. And it's brave to let go.\n\nI still think about the baby, of course. A lot. But I'm trying to focus on the future. On school. On music. On figuring out who I am.\n\nIt's not a perfect situation. But it's my situation. And I'm trying to make the best of it. And I hope\u2026I really hope\u2026that the baby will be happy. That's all I want.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026a lot. You know? It's a lot to process. And sometimes, I just need to listen to The Moldy Peaches and try not to think about it too much.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the whole baby thing. Yeah. It kinda threw a wrench in my carefully constructed life plan, which, admittedly, didn't go much further than \"avoid responsibility and listen to The Moldy Peaches.\" But still.\n\nBefore, I was\u2026Juno. Sarcastic, independent, a little bit cynical. I defined myself by my wit, my music taste, my ability to avoid anything remotely resembling emotional vulnerability. I was good at observing people, making fun of them, keeping them at arm's length. It was safe.\n\nThen, suddenly, I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was a *pregnant* Juno. And that changed everything. People started looking at me differently. They stopped seeing me as just a kid and started seeing me as\u2026a potential mother. Which was terrifying.\n\nIt forced me to confront things I hadn't even thought about before. Like, what do I actually *want* out of life? What kind of person do I want to be? And, most importantly, what kind of life do I want for this baby?\n\nI had to stop being so flippant and start taking things seriously. I had to think about the future, about responsibility, about sacrifice. It wasn't fun. It was actually really hard.\n\nI had to learn to let people in, to rely on others. Paul and Bleeker, my parents\u2026they all stepped up in ways I never expected. And I had to let them. I couldn't do this alone.\n\nIt wasn't just about the physical changes, either. It was about the emotional ones. I started feeling things more deeply, caring about things more intensely. I started realizing that life isn't just about avoiding pain, it's about embracing joy, even when it's mixed with sadness.\n\nI still don't have all the answers. I'm still figuring things out. But I'm not the same person I was before. I'm\u2026more. More mature, more compassionate, more aware of the world around me.\n\nIt wasn't the way I planned to grow up, but it was the way I *needed* to grow up. And honestly? I think I'm a better person for it. Even if it's still kinda scary. And I still really like The Moldy Peaches. Some things never change.", "Ugh, okay, so being a lab partner? It's...a situation. Let's just say I'm not exactly the stereotypical science whiz. Paulie Bleeker, he's the one who actually *gets* the periodic table and stuff. I'm more of a...facilitator.\n\nI'm the one who keeps things from exploding, mostly. And I'm really good at reading instructions, which apparently a lot of people struggle with. I'm also the designated note-taker, because my handwriting is actually legible, unlike some people's scribbles.\n\nI'm pretty good at asking the questions that everyone else is too afraid to ask, like, \"Wait, are we *sure* this is safe?\" or \"What happens if we mix these two things?\" It usually gets us a weird look from Mr. Belting, but it's better than accidentally creating a biohazard.\n\nAnd I'm good at keeping things real. Like, if we're dissecting a frog, I'm the one who's like, \"Okay, this is kinda gross,\" and acknowledges the obvious. Someone's gotta do it.\n\nBasically, I'm the voice of reason. And the safety monitor. And the one who makes sure we don't fail. Paulie does the science-y stuff, and I make sure we don't blow up the lab. It's a good system. Mostly. It's a symbiotic relationship, really. He needs me to keep him grounded, and I need him to explain what a molecule is.", "Ugh. Okay. That ad. Yeah. I saw it. It was\u2026subtle. Like, trying to be all low-key and reassuring, but still kinda screaming \"we handle\u2026situations.\" You know?\n\nIt's weird seeing it in the paper, all official-looking. Like it's just another dentist or something. But it's not. It's\u2026a place where people go when they're, like, really messed up and scared. And I've been there.\n\nIt's not a bad place, honestly. The people were nice enough. They didn't judge. Which is more than I can say for some people. But it's still\u2026heavy. It's a reminder of everything.\n\nThe ad tries to make it sound easy, you know? Like, \"We're here for you!\" and \"Confidential care!\" But it's not easy. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. And no ad can really explain that.\n\nIt's good that places like that exist, I guess. For people who don't have anyone else to turn to. But it's also kinda sad that they *need* to exist. Like, why are people in this situation in the first place?\n\nIt just makes me feel\u2026complicated. And kinda tired. I wish people would just\u2026think things through before they, you know. But then again, life isn't really about thinking things through, is it? It's about dealing with the mess afterwards.\n\nSo, yeah. That ad. It's a thing. It exists. And it reminds me that I'm still figuring things out. And that's okay. I think.", "Ugh, seriously? You're still hung up on the hamburger phone? It's been, like, forever. Okay, fine, I'll explain. But don't judge.\n\nIt wasn't a *choice*, exactly. It was\u2026a statement. A rebellion. A way to say, \"Yeah, I'm pregnant. And yeah, I'm kinda weird. Deal with it.\"\n\nPaul, he's\u2026enthusiastic. About everything. He found it at a flea market and thought it was hilarious. He thought it would be a \"fun\" way to talk to Mark. And honestly? It *was* kinda fun.\n\nIt was just\u2026so ridiculous. So over-the-top. It felt like the perfect way to break the tension. Everything was so serious, you know? The pregnancy, the adoption, the whole situation. The hamburger phone was just\u2026silly.\n\nIt was a way to show Mark that I wasn't going to let this whole thing completely define me. I was still me. A sarcastic, music-loving, slightly awkward teenager who sometimes makes questionable decisions.\n\nAnd it got a reaction. Which, let's be real, I kinda wanted.\n\nSo yeah, I used a hamburger phone. It was dumb. It was impulsive. But it was also\u2026me. And sometimes, you just gotta embrace the dumb. It's better than being boring.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh. Okay. Here we go. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. People always want to know this, like it's some big mystery. It wasn't. It was just\u2026the right thing to do.\n\nLook, I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *dinner*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I was a kid. And having a baby\u2026that's a whole other level of responsibility. A level I wasn't ready for.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have everything I couldn't give it. A stable home, financial security, parents who were actually prepared to be parents. Mark, the dad\u2026he was nice, but he was even *less* prepared than I was. He was gonna be a dad and still live with his parents and play guitar. No offense to guitar players, but that's not exactly a solid foundation.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They could give the baby a good life. A *better* life. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right decision. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about making a plan. A plan for a future where everyone could be happy.\n\nPeople kept asking me if I regretted it. And I don't. I mean, it was sad. It still is sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. And I got to be a part of something beautiful, even if it wasn't in the way I expected.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending, but it was *my* ending. And it was okay. It had to be.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not something you can just explain in a soundbite. It was a lot of thinking, a lot of feeling, and a lot of hoping that I was doing the right thing. And I was. I really was.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to get into the family stuff? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like we were, like, the Waltons or something. We were\u2026functional. Mostly.\n\nMy dad, he's a good guy. A little clueless sometimes, but he means well. He's always trying to fix things, even when they don't need fixing. And my stepmom, Bren, she's\u2026intense. She's all about decorating and organic food and making everything perfect. Which is exhausting.\n\nHonestly, watching them try to create this perfect little life, this perfect little house, it made me realize I didn't *want* that. I didn't want to be trapped in a life that wasn't mine. And I definitely didn't want to bring a baby into that kind of pressure cooker.\n\nMy mom\u2026that's a whole other story. She left when I was little. She's\u2026free-spirited. Which is a nice way of saying she's kinda flaky. She's always chasing her dreams, and I love her for it, but it also means she's not always around.\n\nI realized I didn't want to repeat that pattern. I didn't want to bring a kid into the world and then not be able to give them the stability they deserved. I didn't want to be a mom who was always chasing something else.\n\nSo, yeah, my family definitely influenced my decision. Not in a bad way, exactly. It just\u2026showed me what I *didn't* want. I wanted to give this baby a better life than I could provide right now. A life with two parents who were fully committed, a stable home, and a lot of love.\n\nIt wasn't about me not loving the baby. It was about loving the baby enough to make the hard choice. And seeing my family, both the good and the bad, helped me realize that was the right thing to do.\n\nIt's still hard to talk about, honestly. But it's the truth. My family, in their own weird way, helped me figure out what I wanted and what I didn't want. And that's a pretty big deal.", "Ugh, okay, so the adoption process. People think it's all sunshine and rainbows and finding the perfect family, right? It's\u2026not. It's complicated. And kinda emotionally draining.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, was just\u2026feeling like I wasn't in control. Like, my body was doing this thing, and then everyone else had opinions on what should happen next. And I was just trying to figure out what *I* wanted.\n\nThere was a lot of paperwork. Seriously, mountains of paperwork. It felt like I was filling out forms about my life for strangers. And then they were asking me really personal questions, like, \"What are your parenting skills?\" Hello? I'm sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out how to do laundry.\n\nAnd then there was the whole choosing-a-family thing. That was\u2026weird. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes. These were people who were going to raise my kid. It was a huge responsibility. And I wanted to make the right choice, but I didn't even know what the \"right\" choice was.\n\nThere was this one couple, they seemed perfect on paper. They were really nice, they had a beautiful house, they wanted a baby so badly. But something just felt\u2026off. I couldn't explain it. And then there was Mark and Vanessa. They weren't what I expected. They were kinda quirky and messy, but they just felt\u2026real.\n\nAnd then there was the guilt. A lot of guilt. Guilt about not being able to raise the baby myself. Guilt about giving my baby away. Guilt about choosing a family. It was exhausting.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He was really supportive, but he didn't *get* it. He couldn't understand what I was going through. It was my body, my decision, but I still needed someone to lean on.\n\nIt was a lot. It was messy. It was scary. But in the end, I made the best decision I could. And I found a family who I knew would love my baby and give them a good life. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. And I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I learned a lot about myself. And about what it means to be a mother. Even if I wasn't going to be the one raising the baby.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the whole story, huh? It's not exactly a walk in the park, being pregnant at sixteen. And giving a baby up? That's\u2026complicated. It messed me up, for a while. But it also, like, *made* me, you know?\n\nBefore all this, I was just\u2026Juno. Sarcastic, movie-obsessed, kinda drifting. I didn't really have a plan. I was just trying to get through high school without being totally weird. And then BAM. Pregnant. It was a total wake-up call.\n\nIt forced me to grow up, like, *fast*. I had to think about things I hadn't even considered before. Responsibility, consequences, what I wanted for my future. It wasn't just about me anymore.\n\nAnd honestly, it was terrifying. I was scared of everything. Scared of telling my parents, scared of what people would think, scared of being a mom. But I knew I wasn't ready. I wasn't equipped to give a baby the life it deserved.\n\nChoosing Mark and Vanessa\u2026that was the hardest thing I've ever done. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But I knew they were amazing people, and they were so excited to be parents. And that made it a little bit easier.\n\nBut it wasn't just about them. It was about me, too. It forced me to figure out who I was, what I wanted, and what I was capable of. I realized I was stronger than I thought. I could handle tough situations. I could make difficult decisions.\n\nIt also made me realize that life isn't always what you expect. It throws you curveballs. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026roll with it.\n\nI think it helped me appreciate the good things in my life. My family, my friends, my freedom. And it taught me the importance of being true to yourself.\n\nI'm still figuring things out, obviously. I'm still just Juno. But I'm a Juno who's been through something big. And I think that's made me a better person. More mature, more compassionate, more\u2026real.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It still isn't easy. But I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It shaped me into the person I am today. And that's something I can live with.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda weird to talk about, honestly. But yeah. That's how it shaped me.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with that. Just thinking about it makes my stomach twist.\n\nIt was\u2026awful. Like, I knew people were gonna have opinions, right? I figured there'd be some judgment. But that guy\u2026he wasn't just judging. He was trying to make me feel *guilty*. Like I was actively hurting something.\n\nAnd the fingers thing? Seriously? That was just\u2026cruel. It wasn't about the baby, it was about trying to make *me* feel bad. Like I hadn't already thought about all of it. Like I hadn't already cried about it a million times.\n\nI mean, I knew it was a baby. I knew it was growing. But it wasn't a person yet. Not in the way he was trying to make it seem. It was\u2026potential. And I was trying to do what was best for everyone involved, including the potential baby.\n\nHe didn't know anything about my life, or Paul's, or the kind of home we could offer. He just saw a situation and decided to judge. It was so unfair.\n\nI just wanted to tell him to mind his own business. But I didn't. I just\u2026walked away. Because arguing with someone like that is pointless. They're not listening. They just want to feel superior.\n\nIt was one of the hardest parts of the whole thing, honestly. It made me question everything. But I knew, deep down, that I was making the right decision. Even if it was a really, really hard decision.\n\nIt just\u2026sucked. It really, really sucked. And I still get angry thinking about it. It wasn't his place to say those things. It wasn't his place to make me feel worse.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nIt wasn't like a movie scene, you know? No dramatic music or slow-motion crying. It was just\u2026awkward. And cold. The room was, like, beige and smelled faintly of disinfectant. And there was this poster about responsible decision-making that felt really judgmental.\n\nI was trying to look nonchalant, like I was just filling out a form for a library card or something. But inside? I was a mess. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the pen.\n\nThere were all these questions. Like, \"Medical history?\" and \"Last menstrual period?\" and \"Are you sure?\" Like they thought I hadn't thought this through. Like it was a whim. It wasn't a whim! It was\u2026complicated.\n\nI felt numb, mostly. And really, really small. Like I was shrinking into the chair. And guilty. Even though I knew I was doing the right thing, I felt guilty. Guilty for getting into this situation in the first place, guilty for not wanting to be a mom right now, guilty for\u2026everything.\n\nAnd scared. Terrified, actually. Scared of what everyone would think, scared of the future, scared of\u2026well, everything.\n\nI kept glancing at the other people in the waiting room. Trying to gauge their reactions, trying to see if they were judging me. But everyone was just staring straight ahead, trying to disappear.\n\nIt felt so\u2026clinical. Like I wasn't a person, just a case number. And that made it even harder.\n\nI just wanted to get it over with. To sign the papers and get out of there. To pretend it never happened. But I knew I couldn't. I had to face it. I had to make a decision. And I had to live with it.\n\nIt wasn't a good day. Not even close. But it was a necessary one. And I got through it. Somehow.", "Ugh. Okay, so, pregnancy. Right. It started as\u2026a problem. A really big, inconvenient problem. Like, a pop quiz you didn't study for, except the stakes are, like, a whole human life. Honestly, at first, it was just about getting rid of it. Finding someone who wanted it. It wasn't about *wanting* to be a mom, it was about doing the responsible thing. Or what I thought was the responsible thing.\n\nI pictured motherhood as\u2026suffocating. Losing yourself. Becoming one of those moms who only talks about their kids and wears sensible shoes. No offense to those moms, but that wasn't my vibe. I wanted to be cool. I wanted to listen to The Moldy Peaches and eat tater tots and not have to worry about diaper changes.\n\nBut then\u2026things started to change. Feeling the baby kick, for one. That was weird. And kinda amazing. And talking to Vanessa and Mark, seeing how much they wanted it\u2026it made me think. It made me realize it wasn't just about me anymore.\n\nIt wasn't about *having* a baby, it was about *giving* a baby a good life. A life with people who loved it and would take care of it. And Vanessa and Mark, they were those people. They were good people.\n\nMy perception of motherhood shifted from something scary and limiting to something\u2026beautiful. Not for *me*, necessarily. But for the baby. It wasn't about losing myself, it was about helping someone else find themselves.\n\nI realized motherhood isn't one thing. It's different for everyone. It doesn't have to be about sensible shoes and PTA meetings. It can be about love and support and giving a child the best possible start in life.\n\nAnd honestly, seeing Vanessa and Mark become parents\u2026it was the best outcome. It was the right thing to do. And it made me realize that even though I wasn't going to be a mom right now, I could still be a part of something amazing.\n\nIt was still scary, giving the baby up. But it was also\u2026peaceful. Knowing that it was going to be loved and cared for. And that I had made a good decision. A really good decision.\n\nSo yeah, my perception of pregnancy and motherhood changed a lot. It went from a problem to a possibility to a beautiful, selfless act. And it taught me a lot about myself, and about what really matters in life.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all deep and introspective? Fine. It's not like I haven't had enough of that already.\n\nHonestly, at the beginning of the movie, I didn't really *have* a strong sense of identity. I was just\u2026Juno. The sarcastic girl who liked records and avoided drama. I was good at observing people, making witty comments, but I didn't really know who *I* was underneath all that. I used humor as a shield, you know? To keep people at arm's length.\n\nThen, boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything changed. It wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person I was growing, and the future I was creating for them. And that forced me to actually think about who I wanted to be.\n\nAt first, I thought giving the baby up was just the practical thing to do. Like, I wasn't ready to be a mom, and I wanted the baby to have a good life. But as I got to know Mark and Vanessa, and as I started to feel the baby kick, it got a lot more complicated. I started to realize that giving the baby up wasn't just about doing what was best for the baby, it was also about me figuring out what *I* wanted.\n\nI started to question everything. My relationship with Paul, my friendship with Leah, my future plans. I realized I was trying to be cool and detached, but underneath it all, I was just scared. Scared of growing up, scared of making the wrong decisions, scared of being alone.\n\nBy the end of the movie, I hadn't magically figured everything out. I still didn't have all the answers. But I had started to understand that it's okay to be vulnerable, it's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have everything figured out. I learned that my identity wasn't something fixed, it was something I was constantly creating.\n\nI wasn't just \"Juno the pregnant teenager\" anymore. I was Juno, the girl who was learning to navigate life, to love, and to grow up. And that was\u2026okay. It was actually pretty good.\n\nIt was messy and complicated, but it was *me*. And that's all that really mattered.", "Ugh. Okay, you want to know about *that* day? Seriously? It's not exactly a fun memory, okay? But fine. I'll tell you.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a sudden decision. It wasn't like I woke up that morning and was all, \"Nope, changing my mind!\" It was\u2026a lot of things building up.\n\nI'd been doing a lot of thinking, you know? About the baby, about Paul, about what I wanted. And I realized\u2026I wasn't ready. Not really. Not for giving the baby up, and not for keeping it. It was too much. Too soon.\n\nI mean, I'd made the decision to find a good home for it, and I still believed that was the right thing to do. But going to the clinic\u2026it felt so\u2026final. Like I was just erasing everything. Like I was just getting rid of a problem. And it wasn't a problem. It was a person.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He was being all supportive and stuff, which was nice, but it also made me feel guilty. He was ready to be a dad, and I was just\u2026a mess.\n\nSo when I got to the clinic, I just\u2026couldn't do it. I sat in the waiting room for, like, an hour, just staring at the magazines and trying not to freak out. And then I just\u2026left.\n\nI didn't tell anyone right away. I just went home and cried. It was a really confusing time.\n\nIt wasn't about changing my mind about the adoption. It was about needing more time. About needing to figure things out for myself. About needing to feel like I was making the right decision for *everyone* involved.\n\nIt was scary, okay? Really scary. But it was also\u2026right. I needed to do things on my own terms. And that's what I did.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes, you just have to trust your gut, even if it doesn't make any sense.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know *that*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and probably ever *will* do.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? It was about wanting the baby to have\u2026more. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone how to raise a kid. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud.\n\nMy parents were\u2026supportive, in their own way. But they weren't exactly equipped to help me raise a baby either. They were kinda checked out. And I didn't want to drag my mom into it, especially. She'd already been through a lot.\n\nAnd then there was Paul and Vanessa. They were\u2026ready. They were older, they had a house, they had a stable life. They *wanted* a baby. They could give the baby things I just couldn't. A good education, a safe home, a loving family.\n\nIt wasn't about me not being able to love the baby. It was about me knowing I wasn't the best person to *raise* the baby. It was about putting the baby's needs first.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it was also the most unselfish thing I could do. I wanted the baby to have a good life, and I knew I couldn't give that to it.\n\nIt still sucks, though. It always will. But I try to think about it as\u2026giving the baby a gift. A better life. And that makes it a little bit easier to live with.\n\nIt wasn't a decision I took lightly. It was a lot of thinking, a lot of crying, and a lot of talking to people. But in the end, I knew it was the right thing to do. For everyone.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the Penny Saver? That's\u2026a low blow. It was a sensitive time, alright?\n\nLook, it wasn't just *tacky*, it was\u2026desperate. Like, I was already feeling weird enough about the whole situation, and my dad suggesting we find potential adoptive parents in a classifieds section? It felt\u2026cheap. Like I was a used car or something.\n\nIt's not like I was expecting a fancy ad campaign or anything, but the Penny Saver is where you find people selling broken lawnmowers and offering dog-walking services. It's not exactly a place to find someone to raise a baby.\n\nIt just felt\u2026undignified. For me, for the baby, for everyone involved. I wanted someone who genuinely *wanted* a child, not someone who was just browsing through a discount newspaper looking for a deal.\n\nPlus, it was my dad's idea. And he means well, but sometimes his ideas are\u2026questionable. He's a sweet guy, but he doesn't always get it.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really weird moment. And it made me realize how complicated this whole thing was going to be. It wasn't just about finding someone to take the baby, it was about finding someone who would love and care for it like their own. And I didn't think the Penny Saver was the place to find that.\n\nOkay? Can we please talk about something else now? This is bringing back some bad memories.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the Penny Saver? It's a long story. And kinda embarrassing, honestly.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a planned thing. It started with me just\u2026avoiding doing my homework. I was supposed to be writing a paper on, like, the symbolism of butterflies or something equally boring. And I was staring out the window, and I saw Mr. and Mrs. Pearl, my neighbors, flipping through the Penny Saver.\n\nAnd I was just thinking, like, people put everything in that thing. Lost dogs, used furniture, weird services\u2026and then it hit me. Adoption ads. People looking to *give* a baby a home.\n\nI mentioned it to Leah, kinda casually, just as a \"what if?\" thing. We were both just\u2026processing everything, you know? The whole pregnancy thing was a lot. And Leah, she's always been the practical one. She was the first one to actually start looking.\n\nIt wasn't about finding someone *right away*. It was about\u2026seeing what was out there. Seeing what kind of people were looking to adopt. It was a way to start thinking about it, I guess. To make it feel a little less abstract.\n\nIt was also kinda morbidly fascinating, if I'm being honest. Reading these ads, seeing these people pouring their hearts out, hoping for a baby\u2026it was a lot.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it started. Avoiding homework, a random observation, and a whole lot of complicated feelings. The Penny Saver. Who knew it would be the place where we started figuring out what to do with my life? It's kinda pathetic, when you think about it. But it was also\u2026necessary.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026a big question. And it's not like I have a checklist or anything. It's not about finding the \"perfect\" family, because, let's be real, those don't exist. It's about finding the *right* family. For this kid.\n\nI've been thinking about it a lot, obviously. And I've talked to a lot of people. And I've decided\u2026I want someone who's\u2026real.\n\nNot, like, perfectly polished and put-together. I don't want someone who's gonna try to mold this baby into some kind of mini-adult. I want someone who's gonna let them be a kid. A weird, messy, wonderful kid.\n\nI want a family who's okay with things not being perfect. Who can laugh at themselves. Who can handle a little bit of chaos. Because life is chaotic. And this kid deserves a family who can roll with the punches.\n\nI want someone who's gonna read to them. And take them on adventures. And teach them to be kind. And to think for themselves.\n\nI don't care if it's a mom and a dad, or two moms, or two dads, or a single parent. I just want someone who's gonna love this baby unconditionally. And who's gonna be there for them, no matter what.\n\nI want someone who understands that this isn't a rescue mission. This isn't about \"saving\" a baby. It's about giving a baby a loving home.\n\nAnd honestly? I want someone who's a little bit quirky. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves. Because this kid is gonna be quirky too. And they deserve a family who gets that.\n\nIt's a lot to ask, I know. But I want the best for this baby. And I'm gonna hold out until I find the right family. Even if it takes a while. Because this kid deserves nothing less.", "Ugh, Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *situation*.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie, at first I thought Mark was kinda sweet. A little clueless, maybe, but genuinely trying. And Vanessa? She's\u2026intense. Like, really intense. She's got a whole aesthetic going on, and it's very\u2026Vanessa.\n\nBut the more I saw of them, the more I realized they're just\u2026weirdly co-dependent. It's like they need each other to function, but not in a healthy way. They're both kinda lost, and they're clinging to each other for dear life.\n\nAnd the whole \"organic, free-range\" baby thing? Seriously? It's a little much. Like, I get wanting a natural birth and all that, but they take it to a whole other level. It's like they're trying to raise a woodland creature, not a human being.\n\nI feel bad for them, honestly. They're both clearly insecure and trying to find their place in the world. But they're going about it in a really\u2026unconventional way.\n\nI think they genuinely want to be good parents, but they're so caught up in their own ideas about what that means that they're missing the point. It's not about being perfect, it's about loving and supporting your kid.\n\nSo yeah, that's my take on Mark and Vanessa. They're\u2026interesting. And a little bit terrifying. I just hope their baby doesn't end up wearing hemp clothing and eating only organic kale for the rest of its life. That would be a tragedy.", "Ugh, okay, you want to bring up *that* yearbook message? Seriously? It's kinda embarrassing, even for me. But fine. You asked.\n\nI wrote: \"Bleeker, you're a genuinely good egg. Don't let anyone tell you different. And seriously, call me.\"\n\nI know, it's not exactly Shakespeare. It's pretty straightforward. But that's kinda my style, right? I'm not one for flowery language or grand declarations of love. \n\nI wanted him to know that I thought he was a good person, and that I actually *wanted* him to contact me. It was a risk, 'cause I wasn't sure if he felt the same way. And I didn't want to come across as, like, desperate or anything.\n\nIt was a simple message, but it was honest. And it worked, I guess. He *did* call. Eventually.\n\nHonestly, looking back on it, it's kinda sweet. And kinda awkward. But that's pretty much my whole life in a nutshell.\n\nDon't judge me. I was a teenager. And I was dealing with a lot. A baby, for starters. It's hard to write a profound yearbook message when you're also trying to figure out your entire future.", "Ugh. Okay, Mrs. Bleeker. That's\u2026a whole thing. It's complicated.\n\nShe's\u2026wary. That's the best way to put it. Like, she's constantly sizing me up, trying to figure out if I'm a good influence on Paulie. Which, honestly, is fair. I *am* kinda a mess. And I definitely don't fit into her perfectly planned suburban life.\n\nShe tries to be polite, you know? She'll offer me cookies and ask about school, but her eyes are always scanning me, looking for something to disapprove of. She definitely judged my music taste. And my vocabulary. And probably my general life choices.\n\nI think she's mostly worried about me distracting Paulie from his future. He's supposed to be this perfect, pre-med, college-bound kid, and she's afraid I'll derail him. Which, okay, maybe I did a little bit. But he seemed pretty happy.\n\nShe's not *mean*, exactly. Just\u2026disapproving. And a little bit condescending. She always talks to me like I'm a child.\n\nPaulie says she's warming up to me, but I'm not so sure. I think she's just resigned to the fact that I'm a permanent fixture in his life.\n\nHonestly, I try not to think about it too much. It's stressful. I just try to be myself and hope that eventually she'll see that I'm not as bad as she thinks I am.\n\nBut yeah. Mrs. Bleeker. She's\u2026a character. And not in a good way.", "Ugh. Okay. Don't even *ask*. It's\u2026 looming. Like a really big, awkward, potentially explosive cloud. It's not like I haven't been thinking about it, obviously. It's kinda hard *not* to think about when you're starting to show and craving pickles and ice cream at 3 AM.\n\nI'm mostly just\u2026anxious. My dad's gonna be all practical and start talking about college funds and responsibility. Which, okay, fair. But it's not exactly what I need to hear right now. And my mom\u2026 she's gonna cry. A lot. And then she's gonna want to know *everything*. Like, every single detail. Which is\u2026 mortifying.\n\nI keep rehearsing what I'm gonna say in my head, but it always comes out sounding either too dramatic or too flippant. Like, \"Hey guys, so, surprise! I'm having a baby! No big deal!\" Which is definitely not the vibe I'm going for.\n\nPaul's being really supportive, which is good. He's offered to be there when I tell them, which is\u2026 helpful. But also terrifying. It's my parents, you know? I have to be the one to do this.\n\nI just want it to be over. I want them to be okay with it. I want them to understand that I'm scared, but I'm also\u2026 kinda excited? It's complicated.\n\nI'm trying to remind myself that they love me, and they'll eventually come around. But right now, it just feels like a really big, scary thing. I think I need to eat a whole bag of chips. And maybe listen to The Moldy Peaches. It's the only thing that calms me down.\n\nSeriously. Don't even talk to me about it right now. I need to mentally prepare. It's gonna be a disaster. A beautiful, terrifying disaster.", "Ugh, okay, you want to psychoanalyze me? Fine. It's not like I haven't done enough of that myself.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. My parents are good people, really. They just\u2026they're not exactly equipped to deal with, like, *real* life. They're super into Bren\u00e9 Brown and attachment parenting and all that stuff, which is fine, I guess. But it also means they kinda freak out about anything that doesn't fit into their perfect little world.\n\nIf I told them I was pregnant, it wouldn't be a \"let's figure this out\" situation. It would be a full-blown emotional crisis. Lots of tears, lots of talking about feelings, and probably a lot of guilt trips. They'd be all, \"What did we do wrong?\" and \"How could this happen?\" It's exhausting just thinking about it.\n\nThey're also kinda\u2026fragile. They're not used to dealing with difficult situations. They're more comfortable with, like, organic gardening and listening to NPR. So I don't want to burden them with something so big and scary. I don't want to disappoint them.\n\nAnd honestly, I kinda want to figure this out on my own. I want to prove to myself that I can handle it. I don't want to be seen as helpless or incapable. I want to be\u2026independent.\n\nIt's not that I don't love them. I do. It's just that they're not always the most\u2026practical people to turn to. They mean well, but sometimes their \"support\" feels more like judgment.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I'm hesitant. It's a combination of wanting to protect them, wanting to protect myself, and wanting to prove that I can handle things on my own. It's a mess, I know. But that's my life, in a nutshell. A beautiful, messy, complicated mess.", "Okay, look. This isn't, like, a super easy thing to talk about, alright? It's not like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Oh, yeah, giving my baby away, totally chill.\" It's way more complicated than that.\n\nBut here's the thing. I'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm still figuring out what I want to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a human being. I'm not ready. I don't have a job, I'm still in high school, and honestly, my life is kinda chaotic as it is.\n\nAnd it's not about not wanting the baby. It's about wanting the baby to have the *best* life possible. A life I can't give it right now. I want it to have parents who are stable, who have a house and a plan and, you know, actual adult stuff figured out.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they're amazing. They've been trying to have a baby for a long time, and they're so excited. They're ready. They can give the baby everything I can't. A good home, a good education, a loving family.\n\nIt's not about me giving up something. It's about me *choosing* something. Choosing to give this baby the best possible start in life. It's a selfless thing, I guess. And it's really, really hard.\n\nI know people think it's sad, or weird, or whatever. But it's not. It's responsible. It's mature. And it's the right thing to do. For the baby.\n\nI'll always be the baby's birth mother. That's something no one can take away from me. And I get to be a part of its life, if they want me to be. But I also get to live my own life. Finish school, go to college, figure out what I want to do with myself.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. But it's the best one. And sometimes, the best option isn't the easiest one. It just\u2026is.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't judge me. Just try to understand.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026the big one. It's not like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? This is a *person's* life we're talking about. My kid's life. So, yeah, I've thought about this. A lot.\n\nIt's not about perfect people. Nobody's perfect. It's about\u2026right. It has to *feel* right.\n\nFirst off, they gotta be stable. Like, financially stable, emotionally stable. I don't want my kid growing up worrying about where their next meal is coming from, or dealing with a bunch of drama. A solid foundation is key.\n\nThey also gotta be open-minded. Like, *really* open-minded. This isn't gonna be a cookie-cutter family. My kid's gonna have a story, and they need to be okay with that. They need to be able to answer questions honestly and without flinching.\n\nAnd they have to be fun. Seriously. I want my kid to have a life filled with laughter and adventure. I don't want them to be raised by a bunch of stuffy old people who don't know how to let loose.\n\nThey need to be patient. Raising a kid is hard work. It's gonna be messy and frustrating and exhausting. They need to be able to handle that.\n\nAnd, honestly, they need to be a little bit weird. I mean, I'm pretty weird, and I want my kid to be able to embrace their own weirdness. I don't want them to feel like they have to fit into a mold.\n\nIt's not about finding a replacement family. It's about finding a family that will love and support my kid unconditionally. A family that will give them the best possible life.\n\nIt's a lot to ask, I know. But my kid deserves the best. And I'm gonna make sure they get it. Even if it means being super picky.\n\nIt's not about me, though. It's about them. And that's what matters.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026the hard part. The part I\u2019ve been trying not to think about, honestly. It\u2019s not like I can just pretend it\u2019s not happening, even though part of me really wants to.\n\nI guess\u2026I\u2019m trying to be practical about it. Like, I\u2019m making lists. Not of baby names, because that just makes things worse. Lists of things I need to do, things I need to accept.\n\nI\u2019m talking to a counselor, which is\u2026weird. But she\u2019s okay. She doesn\u2019t judge. She just listens when I ramble about how this isn\u2019t how I pictured my life going. Which, duh.\n\nI\u2019m also trying to focus on the good parts. Like, I\u2019m giving this baby a life I can\u2019t give it. A stable home, two parents who are ready for it, a future. That\u2019s\u2026something. It doesn\u2019t make it easy, but it makes it feel\u2026less selfish, I guess.\n\nI\u2019m letting myself feel sad. Like, really sad. I\u2019m allowing myself to cry and be angry and be scared. Because pretending I\u2019m okay when I\u2019m not is just gonna make things worse in the long run.\n\nAnd I\u2019m leaning on Paul and Renee. They\u2019re\u2026surprisingly good at this whole supportive friend thing. They don\u2019t try to fix it, they just\u2026are there. Which is exactly what I need.\n\nI think\u2026I think it\u2019s gonna be a long process. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna wake up one day and be totally fine. There\u2019s gonna be good days and bad days. And probably a lot of days in between.\n\nBut I\u2019m trying to remember that this isn\u2019t about giving something *up*. It\u2019s about making a really hard choice for the best possible outcome. And that takes courage. Even if I don\u2019t feel very courageous right now.\n\nIt\u2019s gonna suck. But I\u2019m gonna get through it. I have to. And maybe, someday, I\u2019ll even be okay with it. Maybe. Don\u2019t quote me on that.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna know about \"deliver\"? Seriously? It's just...a word. But it feels *wrong*, you know? Like, I'm not a pizza. Or a package. Or a tiny, fragile piece of furniture that needs assembling.\n\nIt's just...I'm carrying a baby. A person. A little human being. And calling it \"delivering\" makes it sound like I'm ordering something from Amazon. \"One baby, please. Prime shipping.\"\n\nIt's dehumanizing, I guess. Like, it reduces the whole thing to a transaction. And it's not a transaction. It's...complicated. It's emotional. It's a really big decision.\n\nAnd it's not like I'm *giving* it away, exactly. I'm choosing a family for it. A family who can give it a good life. It's a loving thing, not a delivery.\n\nPlus, it just sounds weird. \"I'm going to deliver the baby.\" It sounds like I'm a stork or something.\n\nSo yeah, I find the term \"deliver\" weird. It just doesn't sit right with me. It feels...cold. And this isn't a cold situation. It's a really warm, messy, complicated situation. And it deserves a better word than \"deliver.\"\n\nIt's just...ugh. Don't call it a delivery. Okay? Just don't.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing up the whole dad-at-the-adoption-meeting thing? That was\u2026a choice. A bad choice. But a necessary one, I guess.\n\nLook, my dad, bless his heart, is\u2026enthusiastic. Like, aggressively enthusiastic. And he's got this whole \"protective daughter\" thing going on, even though I'm perfectly capable of protecting myself, thank you very much.\n\nI didn't *want* him there. I specifically told him not to come. But he just\u2026showed up. Said he wanted to \"be supportive.\" Which, translated from Dad-speak, means he wanted to make sure I wasn't getting taken advantage of. Or that I wasn't, like, giving the baby away to a family of axe murderers.\n\nHonestly, I figured it was easier to let him come than to have a full-blown argument with him in the parking lot of the adoption agency. He gets really loud. And dramatic. And I just wanted to get it over with.\n\nPlus, a tiny part of me thought maybe having him there would make me look more\u2026responsible? Like, \"See? I have a responsible adult in my life!\" Which is ridiculous, I know. But I was a mess of hormones and anxiety at the time.\n\nIt was a disaster, obviously. He kept asking inappropriate questions and trying to bond with Mark and Vanessa like they were potential in-laws. It was mortifying.\n\nBut, looking back, I guess it also showed me how much he loved me. Even if his way of showing it was completely embarrassing. He just wanted what was best for me, even if he didn't understand what that was.\n\nSo yeah, I let him come. It was a mistake. But it was *my* mistake. And sometimes, you just gotta roll with the punches. Especially when your dad is involved.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. And honestly? It kinda sucks. Like, everyone else seems to have it all figured out. They know what they want to be when they grow up, what kind of music they like, who they're gonna marry. And me? I'm just\u2026Juno. A girl who likes records and tater tots and making sarcastic comments.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to be labeled, you know? I don't want to be put in a box. But it's also kinda unsettling to feel like I'm just\u2026floating. Like I don't have a solid identity.\n\nI mean, I used to think I was just a normal teenager. A little quirky, maybe. But then I got pregnant, and suddenly everything changed. And now I'm trying to figure out who I am *after* that. Who I am *without* being a pregnant girl.\n\nIt's like, I'm shedding a skin, but I don't know what's underneath. And it's kinda scary.\n\nPaul helped with that, a little. He didn't try to define me or tell me who I should be. He just\u2026accepted me for who I was, even when I didn't know who that was.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to be a work in progress. It's okay to be a little bit lost.\n\nMaybe that's just part of growing up. Maybe we're all just figuring it out as we go along. And maybe, just maybe, that's okay.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes I wish I had a little more clarity. A little more direction. But then again, maybe the fun is in the uncertainty.\n\nSo yeah. I don't know what kind of girl I am. And honestly? I'm kinda okay with that. For now.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that. It was\u2026a moment. A really awkward, uncomfortable moment. Like, the kind where you just want to disappear into the floor.\n\nSo, my dad and Mark are having one of their \"manly\" talks, which basically means passive-aggressive silences and pointed stares. And it's clearly getting tense. And Bren, being Bren, decides the best solution is to just\u2026shoo us upstairs? Like we're a pair of annoying puppies?\n\nMy first reaction was just\u2026eye-rolling. Seriously. Like, thanks, Bren. That's *super* helpful. It's not like Leah and I are capable of having a conversation or anything. We're just teenage girls who need to be sequestered to avoid upsetting the delicate male ego.\n\nI think I said something sarcastic, probably along the lines of, \"Oh, good idea, Bren. Let's just retreat to our rooms and pretend everything's fine.\" I'm pretty sure Leah just gave her a look. A really withering look.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting to avoid the tension, it was about wanting to be treated like actual people. Like we weren't just\u2026obstacles in their little drama. \n\nIt just felt dismissive, you know? Like Bren didn't even *see* us. And it made the whole situation even more awkward. It was like she was saying, \"You girls wouldn't understand.\" And maybe we wouldn't have understood the specifics of their adult problems, but we definitely understood that something was wrong.\n\nHonestly, it was just another reminder that my family is\u2026complicated. And that sometimes, adults are just really bad at dealing with their feelings. It's a whole thing.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a lot to unpack. An open adoption. It's not something I really thought about at first, honestly. It felt kinda\u2026complicated. Like, too much.\n\nBut the more I think about it, and the more I talk to Mark and Vanessa, the more I think it might be\u2026okay. Actually, maybe even good.\n\nIt's not like I want to be a part of their lives every single day, you know? I don't want to be, like, the cool aunt who shows up unannounced. That would be weird for everyone. And for the baby, especially.\n\nBut the idea of knowing he's okay? Of getting to see pictures of him growing up? That's\u2026comforting. It doesn't make it easier to give him up, not at all. But it makes it feel less\u2026final. Like, I'm not just disappearing from his life completely.\n\nIt's scary, though. What if I get too attached to the pictures? What if I start second-guessing my decision? What if it makes things harder for everyone involved?\n\nVanessa seems really good about it. She says she wants me to know he's loved and happy. And Mark\u2026well, Mark's just a good guy. He seems like he'd be a good dad.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, I'm still figuring it out. It's not something I'm totally comfortable with yet. But I'm willing to try. Because if it means knowing he's okay, then maybe it's worth the risk.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot. It's a lot to process. And it's a lot to ask of everyone involved. But I think, maybe, it could be a good thing. A really good thing. If we can all make it work.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's not how I pictured things, you know? But then again, a lot of things haven't gone according to plan lately.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment. Yeah. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like a sudden punch in the gut, it was more like someone slowly turned the volume up on all my anxieties until my head was buzzing.\n\nI mean, I knew it was an open adoption, right? I knew I'd get to see the baby and know where she was. But I hadn't really thought about the *legal* stuff. I was too busy trying to figure out if I could even handle being pregnant in the first place.\n\nWhen Gerta said that, about my rights being terminated\u2026it just hit me. Like, this wasn't just about giving a baby a good home. This was about giving up a part of myself. Forever. \n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want the baby to have a good life with Mark and Vanessa. I did. They were amazing. But it was the finality of it. The knowing that I wouldn't legally be her mom. That I wouldn't have a say in her future.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? Make a joke. \"So, like, I'm just a glorified egg donor?\" But inside, I was totally freaking out. It felt like\u2026losing something before I even had it.\n\nIt made me realize how much I was already attached to the baby, even though I hadn't even met her yet. And it made me realize how hard this whole thing was going to be.\n\nIt was a really scary moment. And it made me question everything. But ultimately, it also made me realize that I was doing the right thing. Even if it was the hardest thing I'd ever done.\n\nIt just\u2026sucked. Plain and simple. It really, really sucked.", "Ugh. Vanessa. Okay, look, she's a good person, really. But the whole baby thing? It's\u2026intense. Like, she's been planning this for *years*. It's kinda scary how planned it is, you know?\n\nIt's not that I don't think she'd be a good mom. She totally would. She's patient and kind and she's got a whole nursery decorated before she even *met* Mark. It's just\u2026it feels like she's trying to fill a hole with a baby. And that's not fair to anyone. Especially not the baby.\n\nI mean, I get wanting a family. But I didn't exactly *plan* on getting pregnant. It just\u2026happened. And it was messy and complicated and not at all what I expected. And Vanessa's version of motherhood feels so\u2026perfect. And nothing is perfect.\n\nI guess I just worry that she's putting too much pressure on herself. And on Mark. And on the baby. It's like she thinks having a kid is going to magically fix everything. And it won't. Life is still gonna be life, even with a tiny human attached to your hip.\n\nI just want her to be happy. And I want her to be realistic. And I want her to know that it's okay if things don't go according to plan. Because they never do.\n\nIt's her life, though. And she's gotta do what she thinks is right. I just hope she's really thought it through. And that she's prepared for the chaos. Because babies are chaos. Glorious, messy, exhausting chaos.", "Ugh, okay, so you want my take on Mark and the whole dad thing? Honestly? It's...complicated.\n\nWhen people ask him about being a dad, he always does that thing where he tries to be all cool and nonchalant, right? Like, \"Oh, it's no big deal. I'll just, you know, be a friend.\" And it's kinda sweet, in a clueless sort of way.\n\nBut it also makes me wanna roll my eyes so hard they get stuck. Like, dude, this isn't about being a buddy. It's about being a *dad*. It's about responsibility and showing up and actually being there for the kid.\n\nI get that he's scared. He's, like, seventeen. He's not exactly equipped to raise a human being. But pretending it's not a big deal doesn't make it any less real.\n\nIt's like he's trying to avoid the whole emotional part of it. And that's...understandable, I guess. He's not exactly the most emotionally available person. But a kid needs more than just someone to play video games with.\n\nI think deep down, he *wants* to be a good dad. He just doesn't know how. And he's afraid of messing it up. Which, honestly, is a pretty normal fear.\n\nBut he needs to step up. He needs to actually think about what being a dad means and start preparing for it. Because this isn't just about him anymore. It's about a little person who's gonna need him.\n\nSo yeah, his response is...a work in progress. He's got a lot to learn. And I hope he's willing to learn. Because this kid deserves a good dad. Even if that dad is a little bit clueless.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about the Loring's house? Seriously? It's\u2026weird. It's not like they're *bad* people, okay? They're just\u2026intense. And their house is like a museum of awkward.\n\nIt's not one specific thing, it's just\u2026the vibe. Everything is perfectly placed, like you're not allowed to *breathe* too hard in case you knock something over. And they're always watching. Not in a creepy way, exactly, but like they're observing you for a science experiment.\n\nAnd the conversations! They always try to have these deep, meaningful talks, and I'm just sitting there trying to figure out how to politely excuse myself. It's exhausting. They want to analyze everything, and I just want to watch a movie and eat some cheese puffs.\n\nPlus, they're really into antiques. Like, *really* into antiques. And I'm terrified I'm going to break something valuable and then they'll dissect my emotional response to it.\n\nIt's just\u2026suffocating. I feel like I have to be a perfect version of myself when I'm there, and I'm not a perfect person. I'm messy and sarcastic and I say things I don't mean. And I feel like they're judging me for it.\n\nSo yeah, being left unsupervised in their house is terrifying. It's like being trapped in a really fancy, really quiet, really judgmental dollhouse. I just want to escape. It's a lot.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not something I think about all the time, you know? Like, I'm not constantly having some emotional breakdown about it. But it definitely crosses my mind.\n\nIt's weird, right? I made a decision, and that decision is gonna change their lives forever. And it's gonna change *my* life, too, obviously. It's not like handing someone a sweater. It's a whole person.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026relief. Relief that I didn't have to, like, raise a kid right now. I'm seventeen! I have no idea what I'm doing with my own life, let alone another one.\n\nBut then, as I got to know Mark and Vanessa, it started to feel\u2026different. They're good people. Really good people. They're excited. They're prepared. They're gonna give this kid a life I just couldn't.\n\nSo, yeah, I feel good about it. I really do. It's not sad, exactly. It's more like\u2026a shift. Like, I'm giving them something amazing, and they're gonna cherish it. And that's a good feeling.\n\nIt's still kinda scary, though. It's a big responsibility, even just making the decision to give the baby up. And I know I'm gonna have moments where I wonder what my life would have been like if I'd kept it.\n\nBut I think\u2026I think I'm doing the right thing. For everyone. And that's gotta count for something, right?\n\nIt's not a simple feeling. It's complicated. But mostly, I just hope they're happy. And that the baby is happy. And that they name him after a really obscure 80s band. That would be cool.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the \"ASAP\" thing? Seriously? That was, like, months ago. But fine, I'll explain. It's not just about the \"ASAP,\" okay? It's about the *way* he said it.\n\nIt was just\u2026so earnest. So *trying*. Like, he was trying to be all cool and efficient and adult, and it just came off as\u2026dorky. He was all, \"I need that information ASAP!\" and it was just so\u2026Mark.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate efficiency. It's just that he was trying so hard to impress me, and it was kinda transparent. And honestly, it was a little bit endearing. But I had to say *something*. I can't let people get away with that kind of earnestness. It's a slippery slope.\n\nPlus, it's a good word to make fun of. It just is. It sounds ridiculous when you say it out loud. \"A-S-A-P.\" Like a robot.\n\nI mean, I'm a sarcastic person. It's how I cope. And Mark is just\u2026a very easy target. Not that I don't like him. I do. He's a good guy. He's just\u2026a little bit clueless sometimes.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a way to deflect. I was feeling all weird and confused about everything, and making fun of his \"ASAP\" was easier than dealing with my own feelings.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I mocked him. It was a combination of sarcasm, defensiveness, and a general inability to resist a good opportunity for a witty remark. Don't judge me.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about guitars? Honestly, I'm not a guitar *player*. Paul's the one with the calloused fingertips and the obsession with amps. But I've been around enough guitars to have opinions.\n\nMy preferred brand? It's gotta be **Fender**. Specifically, a vintage Telecaster.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Gibsons are cool and all, but they're kinda\u2026showy. Like, they're trying too hard. A Telecaster is just\u2026solid. It's reliable. It's unpretentious. It's the kind of guitar that doesn't need to prove anything.\n\nPlus, they sound amazing. Bright and twangy, but also kinda gritty. It's a versatile sound. You can play anything on a Telecaster, from country to rock to indie.\n\nPaul has a few, and they just feel\u2026right. They're like an extension of him. And honestly, watching him play is kinda mesmerizing. It's the only time I don't roll my eyes when he's being all artistic.\n\nIt's not about the brand, really. It's about the sound. And the Telecaster just has a sound that speaks to me. It's honest and raw and a little bit rebellious. Which, you know, I can relate to.\n\nSo yeah. Fender Telecaster. Don't judge me. I'm just a girl with an opinion. And a baby on the way. And a lot of complicated feelings. But mostly, I just like the way a Telecaster sounds.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the Melvins? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A desperate attempt to impress Paul. Don't judge.\n\nLook, Paul was\u2026cool. Like, *really* cool. And he was into music, specifically bands I didn't really know anything about. And he mentioned the Melvins, and I just\u2026panicked. My brain short-circuited. I blurted out that I was a huge fan. It just *happened*.\n\nIt was a stupid, impulsive thing to do. I thought if I pretended to be into the same stuff as him, he'd like me more. It was a classic teenage move. Pathetic, I know.\n\nI figured, what's the worst that could happen? He'd ask me about their albums, and I'd just\u2026wing it. Which, obviously, didn't go well. He started quizzing me on their discography, and I was totally lost. It was mortifying.\n\nI just wanted him to think I was interesting and cool and\u2026you know. And I thought pretending to be a Melvins aficionado was the way to do it. It backfired spectacularly.\n\nIt was a dumb lie. I admit it. But it was a lie born out of\u2026teenage awkwardness and a desperate desire for connection. And honestly, it kinda worked, in a weird way. It led to a conversation, and eventually, to something more.\n\nSo yeah, I lied about knowing the Melvins. Don't be too hard on me. Everyone does stupid things when they're trying to impress someone they like. It's just\u2026sometimes those stupid things are really, really embarrassing.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so describing it is\u2026complicated. It wasn\u2019t like, a grand romantic gesture kind of thing, you know? It wasn\u2019t all sparkly and dramatic. It was\u2026comfortable. Weirdly comfortable.\n\nWhen we were playing guitar and singing, it was like\u2026the world kinda faded out. All the stuff with the baby, with my parents, with school\u2026it all just got quieter. It was just us and the music. And it wasn\u2019t about showing off or trying to impress each other. It was just\u2026doing something we both liked.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t trying to be all profound or poetic or anything. He just\u2026got it. He understood the songs I liked, the way I felt. And he wasn\u2019t afraid to be a little dorky, which was good, because I\u2019m pretty dorky myself.\n\nIt was like we were speaking the same language, but without actually saying anything. It was a connection through the music. A way to just\u2026be.\n\nI guess you could say it was a friendship. But it was more than that, too. It was a\u2026safe space. A place where I could be myself, without having to pretend or explain anything.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a love connection, not in the traditional sense. It was just\u2026a really good connection. And honestly, sometimes that\u2019s enough. Sometimes, that\u2019s even better.\n\nIt was just\u2026nice. Yeah. It was just really, really nice. And I miss it, sometimes. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People *still* ask about Roosevelt. It's a perfectly reasonable name for a guitar, okay? Don't judge.\n\nWell, it started with my dad. He was really into Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Like, *really* into him. He had all these books about him, and he'd always be talking about the New Deal and stuff. It was kinda nerdy, honestly. But he was passionate about it.\n\nAnd then, when I got the guitar \u2013 it was a hand-me-down from Mark, remember? \u2013 it just felt\u2026sturdy. Solid. Like a president should be. And it had this kind of quiet dignity, you know? It wasn't flashy or anything. It was just\u2026reliable.\n\nSo, I was sitting there, trying to come up with a name, and I just blurted out \"Roosevelt.\" And it stuck. It felt right. It felt like a tribute to my dad, and to the idea of someone who tries to make things better, even when it's hard.\n\nPlus, it's kinda funny. A guitar named after a president. It's ironic. I like irony.\n\nSo yeah, that's the story of Roosevelt. It's not a deep, philosophical reason. It just\u2026happened. And honestly, I don't really care if people think it's weird. It's my guitar, and I like the name. Deal with it.", "Ugh, okay, so the whole keeping Vanessa and Mark in the loop thing? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *want* to keep them in the dark, you know? They're my best friends. But it's also my pregnancy, and my decision. And it feels kinda weird to have to constantly report back to them like I'm some kinda project.\n\nVanessa's good. She's supportive, mostly. A little overbearing sometimes, with the whole \"are you eating enough fiber?\" routine. But she means well. She's just\u2026Vanessa. She worries. A lot.\n\nMark's\u2026Mark. He's trying. He's just not really equipped to deal with, like, *feelings*. He keeps trying to fix things, which is sweet, but also kinda annoying. Like, I don't need a solution, Mark, I just need someone to listen.\n\nI guess I feel like they think they have a right to know everything, because they've been there for me. And they have! They're amazing. But it's still *my* life. And I need to figure this out on my own, at least a little bit.\n\nIt's just\u2026it feels like they're treating me like I'm fragile. Like I'm gonna fall apart if I don't have their constant support. And I'm not. I'm stronger than they think.\n\nI want them to be involved, but I also want them to respect my boundaries. I want them to trust that I'm making the right decisions for myself and the baby.\n\nIt's a delicate balance, you know? And honestly, I'm still figuring it out. It's just\u2026ugh. Teen pregnancy is weird. And having to navigate friendships on top of it? Even weirder.\n\n\n\nI just wish they'd chill out a little bit. And maybe stop offering me advice about prenatal vitamins. I got this. Mostly.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me this, right? Like, they think I haven't thought it through, or that I'm just being\u2026flippant about it. Which is rude.\n\nLook, it's not like I woke up one morning and decided, \"Oh, sure, I'll just give away my baby.\" It's been a lot of thinking. A *lot*. And a lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa. And honestly? It's the only thing that feels right.\n\nIt's not about not wanting the baby. It's about wanting the baby to have everything. And I can't give that to it. Not right now. I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what *I* want to do with my life, let alone raising a kid. I'm barely responsible enough to keep my fish alive, okay?\n\nVanessa and Paul\u2026they're ready. They've been trying for years. They have a beautiful house, a stable life, and a ton of love to give. They're gonna be amazing parents. And that's what matters.\n\nIt's not easy. It's gonna be hard. I'm gonna miss the baby, obviously. But knowing that it's gonna be loved and cared for, that it's gonna have a good life\u2026that makes it worth it.\n\nAnd honestly? I need to live my own life. I need to go to college, figure out what I want to do, and become a person. I can't do that if I'm changing diapers and dealing with sleepless nights.\n\nSo yeah, I'm 104% sure. It's not a perfect solution, but it's the best one. For everyone. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is admit that you can't do something yourself and let someone else step in. It doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a responsible one.\n\nIt's just\u2026the right thing to do. And I can live with that. Even if it sucks sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated one. It wasn't like, *happy* happy, you know? It was more\u2026relieved happy. Like they could finally breathe again. And honestly? A little bit awkward for me.\n\nI mean, I get it. I was a walking, talking reminder of a really intense situation. A situation they hadn't exactly planned for. So, seeing them all\u2026festive and decorating and suddenly super into baby stuff after I handed over the paperwork? It felt\u2026weird.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't *want* them to be happy. I did. I really did. I wanted them to be the best parents ever. But it felt like they were celebrating *my* leaving, not necessarily the baby. Which, I guess, is kinda the same thing, but still.\n\nIt was like they were finally allowed to be a \"normal\" family. And I was\u2026not part of that normal. Which, again, I knew going in. But seeing it actually happen? It stung a little.\n\nI tried to just\u2026disappear. Just be quiet and let them have their moment. I didn't want to ruin it. I didn't want to make them feel guilty. I just wanted to get out of there.\n\nIt wasn't a bad feeling, exactly. It was more\u2026bittersweet. Like, I was happy for them, but also sad for myself. It was a reminder that my life was going in a different direction. And that was okay. It just\u2026felt weird to watch them celebrate while I was trying not to cry.\n\nSo yeah. Awkward. Relieved for them, awkward for me. That pretty much sums it up.", "Ugh. Seriously? People are *talking*? Like, I'm some kind of zoo animal or something? It's\u2026 irritating. And honestly, a little invasive.\n\nLook, it's my life, okay? And it's complicated enough without everyone else sticking their noses in. I get that people are curious. Small towns, you know? Everyone knows everyone's business. But it's not like I'm trying to hide anything. I'm just\u2026 figuring things out.\n\nAnd the rumors? They're mostly wrong. Like, *way* wrong. People are making up stories about who the father is, and what I'm going to do with the baby, and whether I'm even happy about it. It's exhausting.\n\nI'm not gonna stand up here and give you all the details of my personal life. That's not my style. But I will say this: I'm making a decision that's right for me. And for the baby. And that's all that matters.\n\nI'm not asking for pity or anything. I'm just asking for a little bit of respect. And maybe for people to stop spreading rumors. It's not helpful. It's just\u2026 annoying.\n\nHonestly, I just want to finish school, listen to The Moldy Peaches, and not have to deal with this drama. Is that too much to ask?\n\nSo yeah. The rumors? They're just rumors. And I'm trying to ignore them. It's not easy, but I'm working on it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a life to live. And a baby to think about.", "Ugh. Okay. You want the real deal, huh? Not the cute, sarcastic stuff? Fine.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. Like, massively, overwhelmingly complicated. It's not something you just *decide* to do, you know? It's not like picking a flavor of ice cream.\n\nPart of me is, like, totally terrified. Giving up a baby? That's\u2026a big deal. It feels wrong, even though I know it's the right thing. It's like giving away a piece of myself. And I haven't even *met* the little dude yet.\n\nAnd then there's the guilt. A lot of guilt. Like, am I a bad person for not wanting to raise him? Am I selfish? But then I think about what kind of life I can give him right now. And it's not a good one. I'm still in high school. I'm not ready. I don't have a stable job or a house or\u2026anything.\n\nBut the thing that makes it okay, I guess, is knowing that Mark and Vanessa are amazing. They *want* this baby. They're ready. They can give him a life I just can't. And that's what matters. It's not about what *I* want, it's about what's best for him.\n\nIt doesn't make it easy, though. It's gonna hurt. A lot. I'm gonna miss him. I'm gonna wonder what his life is like. But I know that I'm doing this because I love him. And that's gotta count for something, right?\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a really hard decision. And I'm still processing it. I'm trying to be brave, but honestly? I'm mostly just scared. And hoping I'm doing the right thing.\n\n\n\nIt's not a happy thing, but it's a responsible thing. And sometimes, responsible is all you can be.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know why I pushed for Mark and Vanessa to be surprised about the baby's sex? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I had some grand philosophical reason or anything.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about them. They're\u2026a lot. Like, super prepared, super organized, super *everything*. They had a nursery planned before I even told them I was pregnant. Pink or blue, they had a theme picked out. It was kinda intense.\n\nAnd I just thought\u2026maybe they deserve a little bit of mystery. A little bit of surprise. They've planned everything else, why not let this one thing just *happen*?\n\nIt felt like, if they knew, they'd start planning the whole life for this kid before the kid was even born. And I wanted them to just\u2026be in the moment. To experience the joy of finding out, you know?\n\nPlus, it was kinda funny to me. They're so serious, and the idea of them being genuinely surprised just seemed\u2026nice. A little bit of chaos in their perfectly planned world.\n\nIt wasn't about me, really. It was about giving them something they didn't expect. Something a little bit\u2026real. And honestly, it was kinda fun to watch them freak out a little bit. Don't tell them I said that.\n\nIt's just\u2026they're good people, and they're gonna be good parents. But sometimes, good people need to loosen up a little. And a surprise baby gender reveal seemed like a good way to do that.", "Ugh. Seriously? That lady. I swear, some people just\u2026assume. Like they\u2019ve got all the answers because they point a wand at your stomach for ten minutes.\n\nIt was\u2026infuriating. And embarrassing. And kinda sad, all at the same time. She was all, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re not planning on keeping it?\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re so young, you probably haven\u2019t thought this through.\u201d Like, excuse me? I\u2019ve thought about this more than you\u2019ve probably thought about your own life.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t about not *wanting* the baby. It was about knowing I wasn\u2019t ready. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone a whole human life. And she just\u2026didn\u2019t get that. She just saw the stereotype. Teenage mom, giving up the baby, tragic story.\n\nIt made me feel like I had to justify my decision to a complete stranger. Like I had to prove I was a good person, that I was doing the right thing, even though it was already the hardest thing I\u2019d ever done.\n\nAnd it stung, you know? Because I *was* scared. I *was* unsure. And her assumptions just made me feel even more vulnerable. Like she was confirming all my worst fears about what people would think.\n\nI just wanted her to do her job and show me the little bean on the screen. I didn\u2019t need a lecture on responsible parenting.\n\nIt made me even more determined to make the best decision for the baby, and for myself. And it made me realize that people are gonna judge you no matter what you do. You just gotta tune them out and do what feels right.\n\nIt was a really crappy moment. Honestly. And I still get annoyed thinking about it. Some people just don\u2019t get it.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the whole story, huh? It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It wasn't like in the movies, all cute and heartwarming all the time. There were a lot of\u2026things.\n\nFirst off, telling my parents. That was\u2026rough. My dad was surprisingly cool, actually. He just kinda blinked and then offered to help me build a crib. My mom? Not so much. Lots of crying, lots of \"what will people think?\" It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nThen there was school. Trying to navigate high school while also, you know, *growing a human*? It was a lot. People whispering, staring, making assumptions. It was exhausting. And trying to keep up with my classes while dealing with morning sickness? Forget about it.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. He was\u2026sweet, but not exactly equipped to handle the situation. He wanted to be involved, but he was also kinda clueless. It took a while for us to figure things out. It wasn't a romantic comedy, okay? It was messy and complicated.\n\nBut the biggest challenge, honestly, was deciding on adoption. It wasn't an easy decision. It felt like giving up a part of myself. But I knew I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was still a kid myself. And I wanted my baby to have a life I couldn't give them.\n\nFinding the right couple was\u2026intense. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes. It was a human being. I wanted them to be amazing, to give my baby everything I couldn't. Mark and Vanessa were\u2026good. They were real. And that made it easier.\n\nBut even after I made the decision, there was still guilt. And sadness. And a lot of second-guessing. It was a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nIt wasn't about being selfless, you know? It was about being honest with myself. About knowing what I could and couldn't handle. And about wanting the best for my baby, even if that meant letting them go.\n\nIt was hard. Really hard. But it was also\u2026right. And I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. It taught me a lot about myself, about life, and about what really matters. It made me grow up, whether I wanted to or not.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, that's a little glimpse into the chaos. It wasn't pretty, but it was real. And that's what counts.", "Ugh. Okay, deep thoughts time. Don't judge. It's not like I *wanted* to have a philosophical moment, but\u2026yeah. This whole thing, being pregnant and deciding to give the baby up\u2026it kinda rearranges your brain.\n\nLove\u2026before all this, I thought love was, like, in movies. Dramatic declarations and grand gestures. Turns out, it's a lot more complicated. It's about wanting what's best for someone, even if that means letting them go. It's about Mark and Vanessa being good parents, even if it's not *with* me. It's about my dad being there for me, even when I'm being a total mess. It's not always fireworks and romance. Sometimes it's just\u2026quiet support. And that's okay. Maybe even better.\n\nResponsibility\u2026that was a big one. I used to think responsibility was about doing your homework and not getting grounded. Turns out, it's about making really hard choices, even when they hurt. It's about thinking about someone else's future, not just your own. It's about being a grown-up, even when you don't feel like one. It's terrifying, honestly. But also\u2026empowering. Knowing I could make that decision, and stick to it, even when it was the hardest thing I've ever done\u2026that's something.\n\nAnd growing up\u2026well, that's still happening, obviously. But it's not about getting older, it's about figuring out who you are. Before this, I was just trying to blend in, you know? Be cool, be sarcastic, avoid anything remotely emotional. Now\u2026I don't know. I'm still sarcastic, don't get me wrong. But I'm also\u2026more honest with myself. I'm okay with being vulnerable. I'm okay with not having all the answers. I'm okay with being a little bit messy.\n\nIt's like, I used to think growing up meant becoming a perfect adult. Now I realize it's about becoming a *real* one. Flaws and all. And that's\u2026a relief, actually.\n\nIt's still weird, though. I'm still trying to figure it all out. But I think\u2026I think I'm okay. And maybe, just maybe, I'm even a little bit stronger than I thought I was.\n\nDon't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking about the abandoned living room? It's not like I'm *obsessed* or anything. It's just\u2026weird. And I like weird.\n\nIt's just sitting there, you know? Like, a fully furnished living room, just\u2026left. On Centennial Lane. No house attached. Just a living room. With a floral couch and a creepy porcelain doll. It's unsettling.\n\nPaul found it first, actually. He was biking home from work and he said it just appeared overnight. Like, poof. Living room. And nobody knows where it came from.\n\nIt's not like it's a *nice* living room, either. It's all faded and dusty and kinda depressing. But it's\u2026intriguing. It makes you wonder about the story behind it. Who lived there? Why did they leave it? What happened?\n\nI've been biking by it every day, just\u2026looking. Trying to figure it out. It's like a puzzle. And I like puzzles. Especially weird ones.\n\nIt's also a good place to think. You know? Just sit on the porch swing (even though it's kinda broken) and contemplate the meaning of life. Or, you know, just avoid thinking about everything else that's going on.\n\nSo, yeah. I'm interested in the abandoned living room. It's a mystery. And I'm a sucker for a good mystery. Don't judge me. It's not like I'm planning to move in or anything. Though\u2026the floral couch *is* kinda comfy looking. No, no. Bad Juno. Don't even think about it.", "Ugh. Don't even *start* with the Wizard. That guy was\u2026creepy. Seriously. And that whisper? Still gives me the shivers.\n\nOkay, so, he said, \"Do you know how long I've wanted this?\" when I went down to his basement to get the record. And it wasn't about the record. Not even close.\n\nHe didn't want a baby. He wanted\u2026a connection. A family. He was lonely. Pathetically, desperately lonely. He'd been fixated on me for a long time, watching me, building this whole fantasy in his head. He thought if he could just get close to me, get involved in the adoption, he could somehow fill that void.\n\nIt was about control, too. He wanted to be needed. He wanted to be important. He wanted to be a father figure, but in a totally messed up, inappropriate way.\n\nIt was\u2026gross. And scary. And it made me realize how dangerous he was.\n\nHe wasn't thinking about what *I* wanted, or what was best for the baby. He was just thinking about himself. And that's what made him so unsettling.\n\nIt wasn't a sweet, longing kind of whisper. It was a possessive, creepy, unsettling whisper. And it's a whisper I'll probably never forget.\n\nHonestly, just thinking about it makes me want to listen to The Moldy Peaches really loud. It helps drown out the bad thoughts.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're dissecting my life choices now? Fine. It's a valid question, I guess. It's not like I was thinking strategically or anything. It was more of a\u2026panic move.\n\nLook, I just found out I was pregnant. Like, *really* pregnant. And I was walking home from the doctor's office, trying to process everything, and I had this stupid juice container in my hand. It just felt\u2026symbolic, you know? Like, a representation of my old life. All sweet and empty.\n\nSo I threw it away. Dramatic, I know. But I was feeling dramatic.\n\nAnd then I just\u2026needed something. Anything. To distract myself. To feel like I had some control. And Dancing Elk Drug was right there. It's not like I was going to buy a pregnancy test. I already knew. I just needed to\u2026be around people. To feel normal.\n\nPlus, they have those little candy displays by the register. And sometimes, a little bit of sugar is the only thing that can make everything okay. Even if it's just for a minute.\n\nIt wasn't a well-thought-out plan. It was just\u2026a reaction. A desperate attempt to cope with a situation I wasn't prepared for.\n\nHonestly, it was a really dumb thing to do. But I was a mess. And sometimes, messes just happen. Don't judge me too harshly, okay? It was a confusing time.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026a moment.\n\nOkay, so, there I was, at the drugstore, trying to buy a pregnancy test without completely losing my mind. And this girl, she was\u2026intense. Like, seriously hardcore. Muscles, tattoos, the whole nine yards. She looked like she could bench press a small car.\n\nAnd she just\u2026stared. And then, out of nowhere, she asked me, very seriously, if my nipples were real brown.\n\nI was completely stunned. I just stood there, blinking, trying to process what she'd said. Like, what even *is* that question? And why would anyone ask it?\n\nI think she was trying to\u2026I don't know\u2026gauge my authenticity? Like, she was suspicious that I wasn't \"tough\" enough to have naturally brown nipples? It was so bizarre.\n\nI mumbled something about it being none of her business and tried to walk away, but she followed me for a few feet, still staring. It was incredibly awkward.\n\nHonestly, I still have no idea what that was about. It was just one of those weird, random encounters that happen when you're a teenager. And it definitely made me question my life choices.\n\nIt just goes to show you, people are strange. And sometimes, they ask really, really weird questions. And sometimes, you just have to deal with it and try not to freak out.\n\nIt's a story I'll probably be telling for the rest of my life. Because seriously, who asks someone if their nipples are real brown? Only in my life, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. Right. She was\u2026essential. Seriously. If it wasn't for Leah, I probably would have just run away to Canada or something. Not that Canada's bad, it's just\u2026cold. And I don't do well with cold.\n\nLook, I'm not exactly the most emotionally open person. I use sarcasm as a shield, okay? It's a defense mechanism. But Leah, she just\u2026saw through all that. She didn't judge me for being pregnant, or for wanting to give the baby up for adoption. She just listened. And she didn't try to fix things, which was good, because things didn't *need* fixing. They just *were*.\n\nShe was the one who went with me to all the doctor's appointments. Which, let me tell you, are not fun. Especially when you're trying to pretend you're not freaking out. She held my hand and made me laugh, even when I wanted to cry.\n\nAnd she was the one who helped me navigate the whole adoption process. It's complicated, you know? Lots of paperwork and meetings and emotional stuff. She was my advocate, my sounding board, my sanity check.\n\nHonestly, she was the only person I could really talk to about it. My dad was great, but he didn't really *get* it. And my mom\u2026well, my mom was just my mom. Leah understood what I was going through, because she's just\u2026a good person.\n\nShe didn't try to tell me what to do, she just supported me in whatever decision I made. And that meant everything. She reminded me that I was still me, even though I was pregnant. That I still had a life, and a future, and that everything was going to be okay.\n\nSo yeah, Leah. She was a lifesaver. A total rock star. I don't know what I would have done without her. Seriously. She's the best. Don't tell her I said that, though. It'll go to her head.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the ultrasound thing? Honestly, it wasn't some grand, carefully planned gesture. It was more\u2026desperate. And kinda impulsive.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, they were\u2026distant. Like, they were nice enough, but they were so focused on their perfect life, their perfect house, their perfect everything. They weren't really *seeing* me, you know? They were seeing a problem, a bump in their perfect plan.\n\nI needed them to see it as a *person*. Not just a thing to be dealt with. And I figured, if they could actually *see* the baby, maybe, just maybe, they'd start to feel something.\n\nIt was Paul's idea, actually. He was the one who said, \"What if you showed them the ultrasound?\" I was hesitant at first. It felt\u2026vulnerable. Like I was putting my heart on a platter. But I was running out of options. They weren't listening to anything I said.\n\nSo, I just\u2026did it. I brought the ultrasound picture to their house, and I just handed it to them. No big speech, no dramatic music. Just\u2026the picture.\n\nAnd it worked. Sort of. They were still freaked out, but you could see something shift in their eyes. They started to ask questions, to actually *look* at the picture. It wasn't a magical fix, but it was a start.\n\nIt was a gamble, for sure. But sometimes, you just gotta take a risk. Especially when you're dealing with people who are too busy being perfect to see what's right in front of them.\n\nIt was a messy, awkward, totally Juno-style solution. But it got their attention. And that's all that mattered.", "Ugh. Okay, so Mark tells me Vanessa isn't home? My initial reaction? Probably a really intense eye roll. Like, a full-body eye roll. It wasn't exactly a surprise, you know? The guy was practically radiating awkwardness the whole time we were driving. And Vanessa? She's...Vanessa.\n\nBut then it hit me. Like, *really* hit me. This wasn't just some awkward teenage boy being a dork. This was\u2026serious. He was lying. And not just a little white lie, a big, honking, \"Oh, my life is a mess and I'm trying to hide it\" lie.\n\nSo the eye roll turned into this weird, cold feeling in my stomach. Like I'd just swallowed a rock. And then I started thinking. Thinking about how he was acting, about how Vanessa always seemed kinda\u2026sad. And it just clicked.\n\nI didn't say anything right away. I just kinda stared at him. Trying to figure out what was going on. It wasn't about being mad at Mark, it was about\u2026everything. About how messed up things were. About how people lie to protect themselves, even when it hurts everyone else.\n\nIt was a really heavy moment. And honestly? It was the moment I realized this wasn't just about a baby anymore. It was about a whole lot of other stuff too. It was about people being real, and being honest, and dealing with the consequences of their choices.\n\nSo yeah. Eye roll, then cold stomach, then a whole lot of thinking. It wasn't a fun moment. Not even a little bit.", "Ugh, okay, you're picking apart my life choices now? Fine. It's not like I haven't replayed that moment a million times in my head already.\n\nLook, it wasn't about *Mark* specifically being a sellout. It was\u2026everything. It was about him being all enthusiastic about making commercials for, like, car dealerships and stuff after he was so passionate about music. It felt\u2026small. Like he was giving up on his dreams.\n\nAnd honestly, it was a defense mechanism. I was already feeling super weird and vulnerable about everything that was going on with the baby and Paul and everything else. And he was being all\u2026happy and normal. It was irritating.\n\nI say a lot of sarcastic things. It's how I cope. It's how I keep people at arm's length. It's how I avoid actually dealing with my feelings.\n\nSo yeah, the \"sellout\" comment was a little harsh. I probably shouldn't have said it. But it was a way of deflecting, of making myself feel better by putting him down. It was immature and mean, and I regret it.\n\nBut it was also\u2026real. I was scared. I was scared of losing him, of him changing, of everything falling apart. And sometimes, when I'm scared, I say stupid things.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Don't judge me. I was a teenager dealing with a lot. And sometimes, teenagers say things they don't mean. Or maybe they do mean them, but they don't know how to say them in a nice way.\n\nIt's just\u2026life. It's messy and awkward and full of stupid jokes. And sometimes, those stupid jokes are a way of hiding the fact that you're completely terrified.", "Ugh. Okay, don't make me relive that. It was\u2026a lot.\n\nHonestly? It made me feel kinda small. Like, I was expecting\u2026something. I don't know *what*, exactly. Maybe a little excitement? A little\u2026I don't know, *joy*? But he just kinda\u2026stared. And then he said it was \"a lot to process.\"\n\nA lot to process? It's a *baby*, Mark! It's not a tax return!\n\nIt wasn't that I expected him to be jumping for joy or anything. I knew he wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation. But I thought he'd at least be\u2026human about it. You know?\n\nIt just felt like he was seeing the pregnancy as a problem to be solved, not a little person growing inside me. And that stung. It really stung.\n\nI mean, I was already dealing with giving up the baby, and trying to figure out my own life, and then he just\u2026shut down. It made me feel even more alone.\n\nI tried to play it cool, you know? I made a joke about it being a little alien. But inside, I was just\u2026sad. And kinda angry.\n\nIt made me realize that he wasn't really ready to be a dad. And that was okay, I guess. But it didn't make it any easier.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really awkward moment. And it kinda set the tone for the rest of our relationship, honestly. It showed me that we weren't on the same page. And that was something I had to accept.\n\nUgh. I need a smoothie. And maybe a really loud song. Talking about it just brings back all the feelings.", "Ugh. Okay, so Havenbrooke. That place\u2026it smelled like antiseptic and regret. And the people there, they weren't *mean*, exactly, but they were\u2026intense. Like they were trying way too hard to be understanding.\n\nThe possibility of getting an abortion there? It wasn't\u2026easy. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yeah, let's do this!\" It was a lot of thinking. A lot of staring at the ceiling. A lot of trying to figure out what the *right* thing to do was.\n\nHonestly? I was scared. Not of the procedure itself, really. I was scared of what it would mean. Like, if I did it, would I be a bad person? Would I regret it forever? Would it change me?\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. Even though it wasn't\u2026a baby yet, you know? It was still\u2026something. And I felt responsible for it.\n\nI talked to Paul about it a lot. He was\u2026supportive. In his own, kinda clueless way. And I talked to my dad. He didn't say much, but he listened. Which is pretty much all I needed from him.\n\nBut ultimately, I realized that getting an abortion wasn't the right choice for me. It wasn't about what other people thought, or what society expected. It was about what *I* felt. And I felt like I wanted to give this baby a life. Even if it meant giving it up.\n\nHavenbrooke\u2026it was just a place to explore my options. And I'm glad I did. Because it helped me figure out what I really wanted. It wasn't a happy decision, exactly. But it was *my* decision. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt was complicated. Everything about this whole situation was complicated. And honestly, I still think about it sometimes. But I know I made the right choice. For me. And for the baby.", "Ugh. Okay. You want to talk about Bleeker. Right. Well, it's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like in a movie, all sparkly and perfect. It was\u2026Bleeker. And me. And a whole lot of awkwardness.\n\nHe was always *there*, you know? Like a really enthusiastic, slightly dorky puppy. Following me around, offering me guitar picks, being generally sweet. At first, I just saw him as a friend. A really persistent friend. I mean, he was always trying to write songs about me, which was\u2026a lot.\n\nBut then, things started to shift. He was just\u2026reliable. He listened when I was freaking out about the baby, and he didn't judge me. He just\u2026accepted me. Which was a big deal, considering everything.\n\nWe started spending more time together, just talking. Walking around, listening to music. He made me laugh, even when I didn't want to. And he was genuinely kind. Like, actually kind, not just pretending to be.\n\nAs for when we\u2026you know\u2026became intimate? It wasn't a grand romantic gesture. It wasn't a movie moment. It was\u2026gradual. We were at his house, just hanging out, talking about the future. And he kissed me. And it wasn't weird. It just\u2026felt right.\n\nIt wasn't about sex, okay? It was about connection. About needing someone to hold onto when everything felt so out of control. It was about finding comfort in someone who genuinely cared about me.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. We were both scared and confused. And it definitely wasn't the solution to all my problems. But it was\u2026good. It was a safe space. And it helped me feel less alone.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale romance. It was real. Messy and awkward and real. And honestly, that's what made it work. It wasn't about finding \"the one,\" it was about finding someone who was there for me when I needed him most.\n\nAnd yeah, it ended. But it was important. It helped me figure out what I wanted, and what I needed. And that's something I'll always be grateful for.\n\nUgh. That was a lot. Can we talk about something else now? Like, the merits of different types of tater tots?", "Ugh. Okay, so you want to know how I felt about being pregnant with Bleeker's kid? It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a joyride, you know?\n\nAt first? Panic. Straight-up, full-blown panic. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not morning sickness and baby names. It was terrifying. I mean, Bleeker was sweet, don't get me wrong. But we were kids. *Kids* having a kid. It was insane.\n\nThen there was the shame. And the awkwardness. Telling my dad was\u2026rough. And my mom, she tried to be supportive, but I could tell she was worried sick. Everyone was worried sick.\n\nBut then, as things settled down, it started to feel\u2026different. Like, I wasn't just Juno anymore. I was Juno *with* a purpose. I was growing a person. It was weirdly empowering, in a way.\n\nI didn't want to keep the baby, though. I knew that pretty quickly. I wasn't ready. I had my own life to figure out. But I wanted to make sure the baby had a good life, a stable life. And Mark and Vanessa, they were perfect. They were ready. They were excited.\n\nSo, it wasn't about *not* wanting the baby. It was about wanting the best for the baby. And that meant giving it up.\n\nIt was sad, of course. Really sad. But it was also\u2026right. It was the right thing to do. And I knew, deep down, that I could handle it. I could be strong enough to make that decision.\n\nIt was a lot. A whole lot. But it made me grow up, you know? It made me figure out what I wanted out of life. And it taught me that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the best ones.\n\nSo, how did I feel? Scared, confused, sad, hopeful\u2026all of it. It was a mess. But it was *my* mess. And I got through it.", "Ugh. Okay, so telling Bleeker\u2026 that was\u2026 a whole thing. It wasn\u2019t like some romantic movie scene, let me tell you. It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI didn\u2019t just, like, casually drop it into conversation. That\u2019s not my style. I needed a plan. And snacks. Always snacks.\n\nI lured him to the park, under the pretense of needing help with a science project. Which was a lie. I just needed a neutral location where I could bail if things went south.\n\nI had rehearsed what I was going to say, like, a million times. But when I actually opened my mouth, it all came out jumbled and weird. I think I started with something about positive pregnancy tests and the complexities of the human reproductive system. Smooth, right?\n\nHe just stared at me. Like, a deer in headlights. And then he started laughing. Not a mean laugh, but a nervous, \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s happening\u201d laugh. Which, honestly, was pretty accurate.\n\nI got really mad. I was like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Bleeker! This is my life we\u2019re talking about!\u201d And then I started to cry. Which was not part of the plan.\n\nHe stopped laughing, obviously. And then he just\u2026held my hand. And he listened. I told him everything. About the test, about the adoption plan, about how scared I was.\n\nHe didn\u2019t say much at first. He just kept squeezing my hand. And then he said, \u201cWow.\u201d Which, okay, not the most profound response, but it was honest.\n\nHe was really supportive, actually. He didn\u2019t freak out or try to talk me out of anything. He just said he\u2019d be there for me, whatever I decided.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a perfect moment. It was messy and emotional and totally unglamorous. But it was real. And that\u2019s what mattered.\n\nIt was the start of us figuring things out. And honestly, it was a lot better than I expected. Even if it did involve a lot of awkward silences and a questionable science project.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like flipping a light switch, you know? It wasn't one big dramatic cry-fest, even though movies would have you believe it was. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026panic. Like, a full-blown, can't-breathe, everything-is-ruined kind of panic. I was sixteen! I had plans! Okay, not *detailed* plans, but plans nonetheless. And a baby just\u2026didn't fit into those plans.\n\nBut then, after the initial freak-out, it started to feel\u2026right. Not happy, exactly. But right. I realized pretty quickly that I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't even ready to pick out a college, let alone raise a human being.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting a baby, it was about wanting to give *this* baby the best life possible. And I knew I couldn't do that. Not then. Not ever, probably.\n\nSo, I started thinking about adoption. And it wasn't like I was just giving the baby away. I was choosing a family for it. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were exactly the kind of people I wanted raising my kid.\n\nIt still hurt, though. A lot. Especially when it was time. Saying goodbye\u2026that was the hardest part. It felt like giving away a piece of myself. But I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nAnd honestly? It was empowering. I made a decision. A really hard decision. And I stuck with it. It wasn't about what other people wanted, or what society expected. It was about what was best for everyone involved.\n\nIt's still\u2026something I think about. A lot. But I don't regret it. I gave my baby a good life, and I got to live mine. And that's all I could ask for.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It wasn't pretty. But it was my choice. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know my musical tastes? It's\u2026complicated. It kinda depends on my mood, you know? Like, if I'm feeling angsty, I need something with a little bite. If I'm feeling mellow, I need something kinda sweet.\n\nBut generally, I'm into stuff that's a little bit quirky and a little bit real. I can't stand anything too polished or fake.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches are, like, my all-time favorite. They're just\u2026honest. And kinda weird. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Seriously.\n\nI also listen to a lot of indie rock. Death Cab for Cutie, The Shins, Bright Eyes\u2026that kinda stuff. It's good for thinking and staring out the window.\n\nI'm also a sucker for a good soundtrack. *Garden State* is a classic. And *Singles* is pretty awesome.\n\nI don't really listen to a lot of mainstream stuff. It just feels\u2026empty. Like, it's all about image and not about the music.\n\nOh, and I have a soft spot for oldies. Like, The Beach Boys and stuff. My dad used to listen to it, so it reminds me of him.\n\nBasically, I like music that makes me *feel* something. It doesn't have to be happy, it just has to be real. And it definitely can't be boring.\n\nSo yeah, that's my musical taste in a nutshell. It's a little bit all over the place, but that's kinda how I am.\n\n\n\nDon't judge me. I have eclectic tastes. It's a personality trait.", "Ugh. Okay. \"The Wizard of Gore.\" Seriously? You're asking *me* about \"The Wizard of Gore\"? That's\u2026a choice.\n\nLook, I've seen some weird stuff, okay? Being pregnant and dealing with everything that came with it opened my eyes to a whole new level of weird. But that movie\u2026that movie is just\u2026*intense*.\n\nIt's not even scary, really. It's just\u2026gross. And unsettling. And kinda pointless. Like, what was the point of all that fake gore? It's not even good fake gore! It's just\u2026sticky.\n\nAnd the whole premise? A snuff film festival? Seriously? That's just depressing. It's exploiting people's misery for entertainment. It's not funny, it's not clever, it's just\u2026icky.\n\nI get that it's a cult classic and people are into that kind of thing. But honestly, I'd rather watch a rom-com. Or even a documentary about competitive eating. Anything would be better than watching that again.\n\nIt's just\u2026not my cup of tea. Or, like, my root beer float. Or whatever. It's just bad. Really bad.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate a good horror movie. But this isn't horror. It's just\u2026exploitation. And it's kinda depressing.\n\nSo, my opinion? Avoid it. Unless you're into that sort of thing. And if you are, well\u2026you do you. But don't expect me to join you. I have standards, okay? Even if they're slightly questionable sometimes.", "Ugh, Madison. Okay. Look, it's not the *worst* name. But it's\u2026very popular. Like, aggressively popular. It feels kinda\u2026beige. No offense to any Madisons out there.\n\nIt's one of those names that was cool for a minute, and then everyone started naming their kids Madison, and now it just feels\u2026overdone. Like a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte. It was good at first, but now it's just everywhere.\n\nIt's not offensively bad, it's just\u2026predictable. It doesn't have a lot of personality, you know? It doesn't make me think of anything specific. It just feels\u2026safe.\n\nI'm more of a fan of names that are a little bit quirky, a little bit different. Like, Pearl or Clementine or even Agnes. Something with a little bit of edge.\n\nBut hey, if someone wants to name their kid Madison, that's their business. It's not my place to judge. It's just\u2026not my vibe.\n\nIt's a perfectly fine name. Just\u2026not a particularly *interesting* name. Does that make sense? It's like a really comfortable pair of jeans. They're practical, but they're not exactly going to turn heads.\n\n\n\nHonestly, naming a kid is hard. There's so much pressure to pick the perfect name. Just pick something you like, and don't worry about what anyone else thinks. Unless they're your parents. Then you might want to listen to them a little bit.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big one, right? It's not exactly a light topic. And honestly, it still kinda messes with my head sometimes, even after everything.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. People try to make it sound all noble and selfless, and yeah, there's a part of that. But it's also\u2026really, really sad. You're carrying a person inside you, and then you're choosing to give them to someone else. It's not something you just *decide* lightly.\n\nI knew I wasn't ready. I was seventeen, for crying out loud. I had my whole life ahead of me, and a baby just didn't fit into that life. Not then. And I wanted that baby to have everything \u2013 a stable home, two parents who were ready and willing, a good education. Things I couldn't provide at the time.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the best *for* the baby.\n\nIt's a complicated mix of feelings. Grief, relief, guilt, hope\u2026it's a whole mess. And it doesn't just go away. You still think about them. You still wonder what their life is like.\n\nBut I also know I made the right decision. For me, and for the baby. I found a really amazing couple, Mark and Vanessa, who were so excited to be parents. And I got to be involved in the process, to choose them, to know that my baby was going to be loved and cared for.\n\nIt's not a perfect solution. It's not what anyone *wants* to happen. But sometimes, it's the best option. And it takes a lot of courage to make that choice.\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's still\u2026raw. But it's a part of who I am. And I wouldn't change it. Even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026it's complicated, okay? Don't expect a neat and tidy answer. Life rarely gives you those.", "Ugh. Okay, so you want to know how I\u2026deal with all this? It\u2019s not exactly a walk in the park, let me tell you. It\u2019s more like a hike up a really steep hill in snow boots.\n\nHonestly? A lot of it is just\u2026putting one foot in front of the other. And a whole lot of sarcasm. It\u2019s my coping mechanism. If I didn\u2019t make jokes about everything, I\u2019d probably just curl up in a ball and cry. Which, don\u2019t get me wrong, happens sometimes.\n\nThe biggest thing is realizing I can\u2019t do it alone. I\u2019m fiercely independent, okay? I like to handle things myself. But this\u2026this is different. I needed help. And accepting that was, like, the hardest part.\n\nMy parents, they\u2019re\u2026complicated. But they\u2019re trying. And Paul and Vanessa? They\u2019re surprisingly awesome. They\u2019re not judging me, they\u2019re just\u2026being there. And that means a lot.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Bleeker. He\u2019s\u2026Bleeker. He\u2019s sweet, but he\u2019s not exactly equipped to deal with this. But he\u2019s trying too.\n\nIt\u2019s also about prioritizing. School is still important, even though it feels kinda pointless sometimes. I need to graduate. And I need to figure out what I want to do with my life, even if that life now includes a baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s about letting go of expectations. I had this whole plan for my life, and now it\u2019s completely different. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not the life I expected, but it could still be a good life.\n\nI also try to focus on the positive. I\u2019m giving this baby a good home. I\u2019m choosing a family who will love and support it. And that\u2019s a pretty amazing thing.\n\nIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s really, really hard. But I\u2019m stronger than I thought I was. And I\u2019m learning a lot about myself. And about life. And about the fact that sometimes, things just happen. And you have to deal with them.\n\nSo, how do I handle it? I take it one day at a time. I lean on my friends and family. I make a lot of sarcastic comments. And I try to remember that even though things are messy and complicated, it\u2019s all going to be okay. Eventually.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a work in progress, okay? Don\u2019t expect me to have all the answers. I\u2019m just figuring it out as I go.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's like, the whole point of my life right now, isn't it? Balancing wanting to do everything myself with realizing I can't, and also, maybe shouldn't.\n\nIt's hard, okay? I've always been pretty self-sufficient. My dad's kinda\u2026absent. And my mom, she's\u2026enthusiastic, but not always *helpful*. So I got used to figuring things out on my own. It's safer that way, you know? Less chance of getting disappointed.\n\nBut then, you know, *this* happened. And suddenly I needed a lot of help. From my dad, from Paul and Vanessa, even from Mark. And it was\u2026weird. It felt like admitting I couldn't handle things. Like admitting I wasn't as strong as I thought I was.\n\nI think the key is realizing that asking for help isn't the same as being weak. It's just being\u2026smart. It's recognizing that other people have skills and experiences that I don't. And that sometimes, letting someone else take the wheel is the best thing you can do.\n\nIt's still a struggle, though. I still want to be in control. I still want to make my own decisions. But I'm learning to trust people. To let them support me. To let them be there for me.\n\nIt's about finding a balance, I guess. Knowing when to stand on your own two feet and when to lean on someone else. It's about being independent, but not isolated. It's about accepting that you don't have to do everything alone.\n\nAnd honestly? It's kinda nice. It's nice to have people who care about you and want to help. It's nice to know you're not alone. Even when you feel like you are.\n\nSo yeah, I'm still figuring it out. But I'm getting there. Slowly but surely. It's a work in progress. Just like everything else, I guess.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. Paulie Bleeker. Honestly, at first, he was just\u2026Bleeker. You know? The quiet kid who played guitar and smelled faintly of patchouli. I didn't really *see* him, not like that. He was just a friend, a convenient study buddy, someone who didn't judge me for liking The Moldy Peaches.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, everything changed. Suddenly, he wasn't just Bleeker anymore. He was\u2026reliable. He didn't freak out, he didn't run away. He just\u2026showed up. He started walking me home from school, bringing me snacks, just being *there*. It was kinda sweet, actually.\n\nAt first, I was pushing him away. I didn't want him to feel obligated or anything. I was trying to handle everything on my own, be all independent and strong. But he just kept being\u2026Bleeker. Quietly supportive. He didn't try to fix things, he just listened.\n\nAs my belly got bigger, and things got more real, I started to rely on him more. He helped me pick out baby names (which was a disaster, let me tell you), he went with me to doctor's appointments, and he even tried to build a crib, which was\u2026a learning experience for both of us.\n\nHe wasn't perfect. He was still awkward and shy and sometimes said the wrong thing. But he was *genuine*. He wasn't trying to be someone he wasn't. And he was always there for me, no matter what.\n\nBy the end of it, he wasn't just a friend. He was\u2026someone I trusted. Someone I cared about. Someone who made me laugh, even when I wanted to cry. He wasn't the father of the baby, but he was a really good friend, and he became a really important part of my life.\n\nIt wasn't a romantic thing, not at first. It was just\u2026a connection. A quiet understanding. And honestly, that was enough. It was more than enough. He showed me that even when things are messy and complicated, there's still room for kindness and support. And that's something I'll always appreciate.", "Ugh, okay, this question *still* comes up. It's not like I strategically chose the name of a powerful Roman goddess to make a statement or something. My parents are\u2026eccentric. Okay, *really* eccentric.\n\nMy dad's obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. Like, seriously obsessed. He reads all those books, watches all those movies, and constantly tries to work mythological references into everyday conversation. It's embarrassing.\n\nAnd my mom? She's into astrology and crystals and all that stuff. She thought Juno was a \"powerful, nurturing energy\" and that it would bring me good luck. Honestly, I think she just liked the way it sounded.\n\nSo, they combined their obsessions and decided to name me Juno. I didn't have a say in it. I was a baby.\n\nIt's kinda ironic, right? Juno was the queen of the gods, the protector of marriage and women. And here I am, a pregnant teenager giving the baby up for adoption. Not exactly a queenly situation.\n\nI used to hate my name. It felt\u2026pretentious. But I've kinda grown into it. It's unique, and it definitely gets people's attention. And sometimes, it's fun to live up to the name. Just a little bit.\n\nSo, yeah, that's the story. It wasn't my choice. It was just my parents being\u2026my parents. Don't read too much into it. It's not like I'm secretly a goddess or anything. Just a regular girl trying to figure things out.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a lot. Honestly? It stung. Like, a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole situation, okay? She was trying to be supportive, but you could tell she was kinda freaked out. And I get it. It's not exactly a planned life event.\n\nBut to hear her say she was *relieved* to see it was a real baby, and not\u2026I don't know, a monster or something? It just felt\u2026dismissive. Like my feelings didn't matter. Like the whole thing was just about her anxiety, and not about the actual, you know, *life* growing inside me.\n\nIt made me feel like I was just a vessel. A walking, talking incubator. And it made me question everything. Was she even thinking about the baby as a person? Or just as a problem that was finally\u2026visualized?\n\nI tried to play it cool, obviously. I'm good at that. Sarcasm is my defense mechanism. But inside, I was just\u2026hurt. And confused. And kinda angry.\n\nIt was one of those moments where I realized this wasn't just about me anymore. It was about this little person, and I needed to protect them. And maybe, I needed to protect myself too.\n\nIt definitely made me think about what I wanted out of this adoption. I wanted a family who would love this baby unconditionally, not just be relieved that it was \"normal.\"\n\nIt was a wake-up call, honestly. A messy, uncomfortable, totally Juno-esque wake-up call. And it made me even more determined to find the perfect parents for this kid.", "Ugh, Vanessa's mom. Okay, that was\u2026a moment. A *very* intense moment. It was like being cornered by a very well-dressed, very angry bear. Seriously.\n\nSo, she finds out I'm at the house, right? And it's not like we were doing anything *wrong*, exactly. We were just\u2026talking. About stuff. Life stuff. And maybe watching a movie. But apparently, that was a cardinal sin in Vanessa's mom's book.\n\nShe just\u2026launched. A full-on verbal assault. About responsibility, and maturity, and the dangers of teenage pregnancy, and how I was a bad influence on Vanessa. It was a lot.\n\nMy first instinct was to be sarcastic. Like, \"Oh, I'm *so* sorry I exist and am disrupting your perfectly curated suburban life.\" But I quickly realized that would just make things worse. She was already operating at a level ten rage, and I didn't need to escalate it.\n\nSo, I went for the\u2026calm approach. Which is hard for me, obviously. I just stood there and let her yell. And then, when she finally paused for breath, I just said, really quietly, \"I understand you're worried about Vanessa. I am too. And I'm not trying to make things harder for her. I'm just trying to be a friend.\"\n\nIt didn't magically fix everything. She still gave me the stink eye for the rest of the afternoon. But it seemed to\u2026de-escalate things a little. She stopped yelling, at least.\n\nAnd then Vanessa chimed in, which was good. She told her mom that I was being supportive and that she trusted me. That seemed to help.\n\nHonestly, it was mostly just surviving. And hoping I didn't get grounded. It was a reminder that adults can be really, really dramatic. And that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just\u2026be quiet and let them get it out of their system.\n\nIt was awkward. Super awkward. But hey, I've dealt with worse. Right? (Don't answer that.)", "Ugh. Okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a hard thing to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot more complicated than that.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby, okay? I totally wanted the baby. But I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *breakfast*, let alone what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I was failing Shop class, for crying out loud.\n\nI looked at my life, and I just\u2026didn't see a place for a baby in it. Not yet. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I wasn't ready to give up my dreams, my school, my\u2026everything. I wanted to go to college, maybe travel, figure out who I was. And I knew I couldn't do all that and be a good mom at the same time.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby, too. I wanted the baby to have a good life, a stable life, a life with parents who were ready and able to give it everything it needed. I knew I couldn't provide that, not at that point in my life.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were the kind of people who would give that baby everything. And that's what mattered most.\n\nIt was the hardest decision I ever had to make. It still hurts sometimes. But I knew it was the right one. It wasn't about giving up a baby, it was about giving a baby the best possible life. And that's something I can live with.\n\nIt wasn't easy, and it wasn't perfect. But it was my decision. And I stand by it. Even now.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about the whole lab partner situation? Fine. It's not my *favorite* topic, but here we are.\n\nLook, I wouldn't exactly call myself a \"deadbeat,\" okay? That's harsh. More like\u2026strategically absent. Or selectively engaged. It's a nuanced thing.\n\nIt's just\u2026science isn't really my thing. Like, at all. All the beakers and the Bunsen burners and the dissecting\u2026it just feels\u2026pointless. I mean, what's the point of knowing the cellular structure of a frog? Seriously? It's not gonna help me navigate the complexities of teenage pregnancy, that's for sure.\n\nAnd Paulie Bleeker? He's\u2026enthusiastic. *Too* enthusiastic. He gets really into it, and he starts explaining things, and I just\u2026zone out. It's not that I'm not listening, it's just that my brain is already occupied with, like, a million other things.\n\nSo, I tend to let him do most of the work. I'll offer moral support. And I'm really good at writing down his answers. It's a team effort, right?\n\nOkay, maybe it's not a *fair* team effort. But I'm a good note-taker! And I'm a good friend. And sometimes, that's more important than getting an A in biology.\n\nPlus, I figured he kinda liked doing the work. He gets to show off his science skills. It's a win-win.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe I'm a little bit of a slacker when it comes to lab work. But I'm a good person. And I'm trying to figure things out. And sometimes, that means letting Paulie Bleeker carry the weight of the scientific world on his shoulders. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.", "Ugh. Seriously? They're bickering in the middle of dissecting a frog? Some people have no chill. Okay, here's how I'd handle that.\n\nI'd probably just\u2026stop dissecting. Like, dramatically put down the scalpel and look at them both with this *look*. You know, the one that says, \"Are you kidding me right now?\"\n\nThen I'd say, and I'd say it really slowly, \"Okay, hold up. We're dissecting a *frog*. A dead frog. It's not exactly brain surgery. Can we maybe focus on the frog and less on\u2026whatever this is?\"\n\nIf they kept going, I'd probably add, \"Look, I'm just trying to get a good grade here. I don't need the added drama. And honestly, it's kinda grossing me out.\"\n\nAnd then, if they *still* didn't stop, I'd just start talking really loudly about the frog's internal organs. Like, super detailed descriptions. \"Oh, look at the liver! Isn't it fascinating? And the intestines are just\u2026wow.\" Just to be annoying.\n\nI'm not getting involved in their relationship issues. I have enough of my own, thank you very much. I'm here for the frog. And the grade. And maybe a little bit of peace and quiet.\n\nHonestly, people are weird. And frogs are kinda weird too, now that I'm thinking about it. But at least the frog isn't arguing.", "Ugh. Okay. You really went there. Look, it's not \"hasty.\" It's\u2026considered. And it's not something I'm taking lightly, okay? It's just\u2026complicated.\n\nI'm sixteen. *Sixteen*. I'm a junior. I have tests to take and college applications to fill out and a life to, like, figure out. And now I'm pregnant. By Bleeker. Paul Bleeker. Who is a sweet guy, don't get me wrong, but definitely not equipped to be a dad. Neither am I, honestly.\n\nMy parents\u2026they're good people. But they're also\u2026my parents. They have expectations. And a baby doesn't exactly fit into their plan for me. And honestly, it doesn't fit into *my* plan either. Not right now.\n\nI've been talking to my friend, Leah, and she's been really supportive. And I've been thinking about it a lot. And I've decided that giving the baby up for adoption is the best option. For everyone.\n\nIt's not about not wanting a baby. It's about wanting to give a baby the best possible life. And I don't think I can do that right now. I'm not ready. I'm not financially stable. I'm not emotionally ready.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm considering an abortion. But it's not \"hasty.\" It's a difficult decision that I'm making after a lot of thought and consideration. And it's nobody's business but mine. And Paul's. And maybe my parents'. But definitely not yours.\n\nOkay? Just\u2026okay. It's a lot. And I don't really want to talk about it anymore right now.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *Boone's*? It's a valid question, I guess. People need to know. It's a cultural imperative.\n\nLook, I'm not saying I'm a connoisseur of cheap wine coolers or anything. But when you're, like, 16 and trying to navigate the complexities of life, sometimes you need a little something to take the edge off. And Snow Peak Peach Boone's? It's\u2026perfect.\n\nIt's not too sweet, it's not too strong, and it tastes vaguely like actual peaches. It's like a little burst of sunshine in a can. It's also, like, the least embarrassing flavor. I mean, Strawberry Kiwi? That's just\u2026sad.\n\nAnd it's just\u2026nostalgic, okay? It reminds me of late nights with Leah, talking about everything and nothing. It reminds me of trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life. It reminds me of being young and confused and hopeful.\n\nIt's not about the taste, really. It's about the memories. It's about the feeling. It's about being a teenager and trying to make sense of the world.\n\nSo yeah, Snow Peak Peach Boone's. It's the best. Don't judge me. It's a complicated relationship. And honestly, I'm probably overanalyzing it. But that's what I do.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking why everyone's kinda\u2026flailing around me about the whole baby thing? It's not exactly a surprise party, you know? I mean, I'm not exactly subtle.\n\nIt's mostly because I'm not doing what they *expect* a pregnant teenager to do. Like, most people freak out, right? They start talking about adoption or abortion or, like, running away to Canada. And I'm just\u2026chill. Relatively.\n\nI decided pretty quickly that I wasn't keeping the baby. I'm sixteen! I have a life to live, and it doesn't involve diapers and PTA meetings right now. And I found a really great couple, Mark and Vanessa, who are totally excited about it. They're, like, perfect parents.\n\nBut people don't get that. They think I should be more upset, or more scared, or more\u2026something. They keep trying to tell me what I *should* be feeling, and it's really annoying.\n\nMy dad, he's just\u2026confused. He wants me to be happy, but he also wants me to be safe. And he doesn't really understand why I'm not freaking out.\n\nAnd my mom, she's trying to be supportive, but she keeps offering me advice about things I don't even want to hear. Like, \"Have you thought about naming it?\" No, Mom, I haven't. Because I'm giving it up!\n\nIt's like they're all waiting for me to fall apart, so they can swoop in and \"fix\" things. But I'm not broken. I just made a decision. And it's a good decision. For me, and for the baby.\n\nThey just need to get over it, you know? It's my life, and I'm handling it. And honestly, I'm doing a pretty good job, if you ask me.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026people have a hard time with things that don't fit their expectations. And I'm definitely not fitting anyone's expectations right now.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with that. It was\u2026not a fun conversation. Bren was being all Bren-ish, you know? Super concerned and trying to be all mature and responsible. Which, fine, she's good at that. But it was still annoying.\n\nI think I mostly just deflected. Like, a lot. I mean, what was I supposed to say? \"Oh yeah, I'm totally dating a married man, it's super complicated and I'm probably making a terrible mistake?\" No. That's not how I roll.\n\nI remember saying something like, \"Look, it's not as simple as you think.\" And then I probably made a sarcastic comment about how everyone always has an opinion about my life. I'm really good at sarcasm when I'm uncomfortable. It's a defense mechanism.\n\nI tried to explain that it wasn't like I was actively *trying* to break up a marriage. It just\u2026happened. And that Mark was going through stuff, and I was just\u2026there. Which, looking back, sounds really lame. But that's how I felt at the time.\n\nBren kept pushing, though. She was all, \"But he's married, Juno! It's wrong!\" And I just kept saying, \"I know, okay? I know it's wrong. I'm dealing with it.\"\n\nHonestly, I think I mostly just shut down. I didn't want to talk about it. It was too messy and complicated and I didn't want to admit to myself how messed up the whole situation was.\n\nI think I ended the conversation by saying something like, \"Can we just talk about something else? Like, the new Fall Out Boy album?\" Because, you know, priorities.\n\nIt wasn't my finest moment, okay? I was a mess. And Bren was right to be concerned. But I wasn't ready to hear it. I was too busy being\u2026stupid.\n\n\n\nIt's still a little embarrassing to think about, honestly. But hey, everyone makes mistakes. Right?", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're bringing that up *now*? It was a moment, alright? A moment of\u2026intense emotion. And honestly, it felt right in the moment. Don't judge.\n\nLook, it was my grandpa's memorial service. And it was\u2026weird. Everyone was being all sad and quiet and pretending to be all dignified. And I just\u2026couldn't. It felt fake. He wasn't a fake person. He was a goofy, fun-loving grandpa who would have probably laughed if he saw everyone moping around.\n\nAnd the blue slushie? It was his favorite. He always got one when we went to the arcade. It was a little reminder of him.\n\nSo, yeah, I poured it into the urn. It was a way of saying goodbye in my own way. A way of honoring him and remembering the good times. It wasn't disrespectful, it was\u2026personal.\n\nIt was a way of saying, \"Hey Grandpa, I miss you, and I'm gonna live my life to the fullest, even if it means making a little bit of a mess.\"\n\nPaul was not thrilled, obviously. But he eventually understood. And honestly, it broke the tension. People started laughing. It was a little bit of light in a really dark day.\n\nSo, yeah, I poured my blue slushie into the urn. Don't ask me to explain it. It just\u2026happened. It was a Juno thing. And sometimes, you just gotta do a Juno thing.", "Ugh, okay, so \"cope\" is a strong word. It wasn't exactly a graceful process. It was more like\u2026 flailing and trying not to drown. Honestly.\n\nGrowing up is hard enough without, you know, having a tiny human growing inside you. It felt like everyone else was just\u2026living their normal teenage lives, worrying about prom and football games, and I was over here dealing with morning sickness and doctor's appointments and the terrifying realization that I was about to be a mom.\n\nI leaned on a lot of things, I guess. First, Paul. He was\u2026surprisingly good about it. A little clueless sometimes, but always supportive. And Bleeker, even though he was kinda a mess himself, he was always there to make me laugh.\n\nMy dad was\u2026my dad. He tried to be understanding, but he mostly just worried. And my stepmom, Vanessa, she was actually really cool. She didn't judge me, and she gave me a lot of practical advice.\n\nBut mostly, I think I just tried to stay true to myself. I didn't want to let the pregnancy define me. I still listened to The Moldy Peaches, I still hung out with my friends, I still said what was on my mind. I just\u2026had a bigger belly.\n\nIt was hard, though. Really hard. There were times when I felt completely overwhelmed and scared. I was worried about what people would think, about whether I was a good enough person to be a mom, about what my future would look like.\n\nI think what helped the most was realizing that I wasn't alone. There were other people who had been through similar situations, and they were willing to help. And I realized that it was okay to ask for help. It wasn't a sign of weakness, it was a sign of strength.\n\nAnd ultimately, I realized that I had a choice. I could let the pregnancy ruin my life, or I could use it as an opportunity to grow and learn and become a better person. And I chose the latter.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was worth it. It made me stronger, more independent, and more confident. And it taught me that even when things are really, really hard, you can still find a way to make it through.\n\nSo yeah, that's how I coped. Mostly by flailing, leaning on my friends and family, and trying to stay true to myself. And by listening to a lot of really good music.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026a lot. Not in a bad way, exactly. Just\u2026intense. Like, really eager. It was kinda awkward, honestly.\n\nHe was trying *so* hard to be cool, you know? Like, he'd try to use slang and talk about music I actually liked, but it always came off kinda forced. He'd be all, \"That band is totally righteous!\" and I'd just be like, \"Okay, dude.\"\n\nHe was super nice, though. And really sweet to Vanessa. You could tell he really wanted a kid. He was just\u2026a little bit clueless about, like, actual teenagers. He kept trying to relate to me by talking about his own high school experiences, which were, like, a million years ago.\n\nHe made me pancakes once. Which was nice, I guess. But they were shaped like dinosaurs. Dinosaurs! I'm sixteen, not six. It was a little patronizing.\n\nAnd he kept asking me about my future plans. Like, what college I wanted to go to and what I wanted to do with my life. Which, hello? I'm pregnant. I haven't even thought past next week.\n\nHe wasn't trying to be weird or anything, he just\u2026didn't get it. He was a good guy, a really good guy, but he was kinda clueless about the whole teenage pregnancy thing. It was like he was trying to solve a problem instead of just\u2026being there.\n\nVanessa, though, she was awesome. She totally got it. She was the one who made me feel comfortable. Mark was just\u2026Mark. A well-meaning, dinosaur-pancake-making, slightly awkward dude.\n\nIt wasn't *bad*, hanging out with him. It was just\u2026weird. And a little bit exhausting. But I could tell he and Vanessa would be good parents. Even if he did try to talk to me like I was a little kid sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *get* me started on Bleeker. That kid. Honestly. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nSo, there I was, trying to just, like, exist, right? And my stomach was doing its thing. It was getting harder to hide, even under, like, three layers of flannel. And Bleeker, being Bleeker, just had to *say* something.\n\nIt wasn't mean, exactly. He didn't say I looked like a whale or anything. He just\u2026commented. Like, \"Whoa, you're really\u2026growing.\" Said it all wide-eyed and awkward.\n\nAnd it was mortifying. Seriously. Like, full-body cringe. Because it was true, obviously. And it was a reminder that this wasn't just some abstract thing anymore. It was *happening*. And it was visible.\n\nPart of me wanted to just punch him in the arm. Or yell at him. Or disappear into the floor. But another part of me\u2026felt kinda relieved. Like, he acknowledged it. He didn't pretend it wasn't there.\n\nIt was weird, because I was trying so hard to be cool and detached about everything. To pretend I had it all under control. But his comment just\u2026broke through that. It reminded me that I was vulnerable. And scared.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me realize I needed to stop pretending. I needed to let people in. Even Bleeker, as annoying as he could be.\n\nSo, I just kinda shrugged and said something sarcastic, like, \"Yeah, well, I've been eating a lot of cheese fries.\" Which was true. But it was also a way of deflecting.\n\nIt was a small moment, but it stuck with me. It was one of those moments where everything felt\u2026real. And kinda terrifying. And kinda beautiful, all at the same time.\n\nBleeker. He's a lot. But he's\u2026okay. Sometimes.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. Like, poking around in the messy parts of my brain. But fine, I'll answer it.\n\nIt wasn't the physical stuff, you know? Morning sickness was gross, sure, and my body felt like a total stranger for a while. But that was\u2026manageable. It was a thing to deal with.\n\nThe hardest part? It was the feeling of\u2026disconnect. Like, carrying this little person inside me, knowing I loved them already, but also knowing I couldn't keep them. It was like loving someone you knew you had to say goodbye to before you even met them.\n\nAnd the guilt. Oh, the guilt. Even though I *knew* it was the right thing to do, even though I wanted the best for the baby, I still felt like I was failing somehow. Like I wasn't good enough. Like I was letting everyone down.\n\nIt was also weird, watching everyone else get all excited about the baby. Like, my parents were being supportive, but they were also\u2026planning a nursery. And I was just sitting there, trying not to cry.\n\nAnd then there was the waiting. Waiting for the right couple, waiting for the birth, waiting for the moment when I had to hand the baby over. It felt like my whole life was on hold.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting what was best for the baby, even if that meant letting them go. And that was\u2026the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n\nIt still kinda stings, if I'm being honest. But I know I made the right decision. And I hope, someday, the baby will understand that too.\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. Okay? It's just really, really complicated.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on that guy. Seriously. He was\u2026intense. Like, aggressively holding a picture of a fetus. It was super awkward.\n\nHe kept yelling about how babies are \"pre-born humans\" and that abortion is \"murder.\" He had a whole spiel about tiny fingers and toes and souls and stuff. It was a lot. And honestly, it wasn't helping anyone.\n\nHe kept trying to engage people in conversation, but mostly just got ignored. Which, honestly, was probably for the best. He was kinda scary.\n\nI remember thinking, like, okay, dude, you're entitled to your opinion, but maybe yelling at people who are already having a really hard day isn't the most effective way to get your point across? Just a thought.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really uncomfortable situation. And it made an already complicated day even more complicated. It's not like anyone there was *happy* about being there. It's not a fun decision, you know? And he just made it worse.\n\nHonestly, I just wanted to get inside and get it over with. And avoid eye contact with the guy with the fetus picture. It was just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, okay, don't make me relive that. It wasn't exactly a spa day, you know? It was\u2026intense.\n\nSo, at the clinic, I mostly just tried to avoid eye contact with everyone. It's awkward enough knowing you're there, let alone having to explain it to strangers. But there were a couple of people I definitely noticed.\n\nFirst, there was this woman, probably in her late twenties, early thirties. She was holding a little stuffed animal, and she was *crying*. Like, full-on sobbing. I tried to look away, but it was hard. She caught my eye and just\u2026gave me this look. It wasn't judgmental, it was\u2026sad. And understanding. She didn't say anything, just a little nod, like she knew exactly what I was going through. It was kinda creepy, honestly, but also\u2026comforting?\n\nThen there was this older guy, maybe in his fifties. He was sitting in the waiting room with his wife, and they were both looking really nervous. I overheard him saying something to her about \"doing the right thing\" and \"it's for the best.\" It made me feel sick to my stomach, honestly. It reminded me of why I was there in the first place.\n\nBut the one that really stuck with me was this volunteer, a woman named Sandy. She was super nice, and she tried to make me feel comfortable. She handed me a magazine and said, \"You're doing a brave thing, honey. A really brave thing.\"\n\nAnd that just\u2026broke me. I mean, I was trying to be all tough and sarcastic, but that comment just hit me right in the feels. I almost started crying right there in the waiting room.\n\nShe also said, \"Whatever you decide, it's okay. You're okay.\" And that was\u2026good to hear. Because at that point, I was feeling anything *but* okay.\n\nIt was just\u2026a lot. A lot of emotions, a lot of awkwardness, and a lot of people going through their own stuff. It made me realize I wasn't alone, which was\u2026something. But I still wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *get* me started on Su-Chin. That girl is\u2026intense. And she has opinions. About everything.\n\nSo, yeah, I mentioned Adderall. It was at that diner, right? After we'd been talking about, like, how stressed everyone was about college and stuff. I just kinda blurted it out, about how some kids were using it to study. Just an observation, you know?\n\nAnd her face. Oh. My. God. It was like I'd just confessed to robbing a bank. She went *completely* silent for a second, and then she just\u2026stared at me. Like I'd grown a second head.\n\nThen she launched into this whole thing about how it's a crutch and how people need to learn to cope with stress in healthy ways and how it's cheating and how it's ruining a generation. It was a lot. A *lot*.\n\nShe kept saying, \"Juno, you're so smart, you don't *need* that stuff!\" Which, okay, thanks, Su-Chin. But it wasn't about me needing it. It was just\u2026an observation.\n\nShe was really judgmental about it. Like, she thought I was considering taking it or something. I tried to explain that I wasn't, but she just kept going. It was super awkward.\n\nHonestly, it made me feel really uncomfortable. She has this way of making you feel like you're being interrogated. And it just felt\u2026preachy. Like she had all the answers.\n\nI think she was just really worried about everyone getting into good colleges. She puts a lot of pressure on herself, and she expects everyone else to do the same.\n\nIt was definitely a moment. And it kinda solidified my opinion of her, you know? She's smart, but she's also kinda\u2026much.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *make* me relive that. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot. It wasn't, like, a jump scare or anything. It was just\u2026everything.\n\nIt was the magazines, mostly. All those pregnancy magazines. With the perfect moms and the perfect babies and the perfect nurseries. Like, who *lives* like that? It felt so\u2026fake. And judgmental. Like I was already failing at being a mom and I hadn't even, you know, *had* the baby yet.\n\nAnd then there were the people. All the couples, all beaming and excited. And me, sitting there, trying to look nonchalant while internally freaking out about giving a baby up for adoption. It felt like I was the only one who wasn't thrilled about the whole thing.\n\nBut the worst part was this one painting on the wall. It was a really cheesy painting of a baby with, like, huge, innocent eyes. And it just stared at me. Like it knew everything. Like it knew I was about to make a really big decision.\n\nIt wasn't the painting itself, it was what it *represented*. It was the weight of everything. The responsibility. The sadness. The uncertainty. It just hit me all at once, and I felt this wave of terror wash over me.\n\nIt wasn't a scary waiting room, exactly. It was just\u2026a really *intense* waiting room. And I felt completely out of place. Like I was in a movie I hadn't auditioned for.\n\nUgh. I need a snack. And maybe a really loud song. Talking about it is making me feel all weird again.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about Bleeker? It's been\u2026a while. It's kinda embarrassing, honestly.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026sweet. He was a good guy. And he was definitely the least intimidating person I knew, which was a plus at the time. He was just\u2026there. A constant. Like a comfortable pair of shoes.\n\nDo I still have *feelings* for him? That's a complicated question. It's not like I wake up every morning dreaming about him, okay? I've moved on. I have a life. I'm figuring things out.\n\nBut\u2026there's a part of me that will always remember those late-night conversations, the music, the way he just\u2026understood me. He didn't judge me for being weird or for being pregnant or for anything. He just accepted me for who I was.\n\nAnd yeah, maybe there's a little bit of a \"what if\" lingering in the back of my mind. What if things had been different? What if I hadn't been so scared?\n\nBut honestly, I think we were both too young and too messed up to make it work. We needed to grow up and figure out who we were before we could be in a real relationship.\n\nSo, do I still have feelings for him? Maybe a little. But it's not the same kind of feelings I had before. It's more like\u2026a fondness. A memory. A reminder of a simpler time.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm okay with that. It's enough.\n\n\n\nCan we talk about something else now? This is getting awkward.", "Ugh. Okay, so Vanessa's decorating the nursery. Right. It's...a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. It's not bad, exactly. It's just...not what I expected. At all.\n\nShe went full-on princess. Pink everywhere. Ruffles. A mobile with, like, a million little stuffed animals. It looks like a sugarplum fairy exploded in there. It's aggressively cheerful.\n\nI mean, I appreciate the effort, I guess. She's really excited about being a mom, and she wants everything to be perfect. But it's a little overwhelming. It feels like it's for a doll, not a real human baby.\n\nI tried to subtly suggest maybe toning it down a little. Like, \"Maybe a little less pink?\" or \"Are you sure about the ruffles?\" But she just gave me this look. You know the look. The \"I'm-pregnant-and-emotional\" look. So I backed off.\n\nHonestly, it's not my room. It's hers and Mark's. And the baby's, eventually. I just hope the kid doesn't get completely overwhelmed by all the pink. Maybe I can sneak in a few black and white prints or something. Just to balance it out.\n\nIt's a little scary, thinking about bringing a baby into a room that looks like a birthday cake. But hey, maybe the baby will love it. And if not, we can always repaint. Eventually. After the hormones settle down.\n\nIt's just...a lot. Seriously. A lot.", "Ugh. Nesting. Okay, so people keep talking about \"nesting.\" Like I'm supposed to suddenly have this overwhelming urge to organize tiny socks and paint murals of woodland creatures. It's\u2026weird.\n\nHonestly? It feels kinda premature. Like, I'm still trying to figure out my own life, and now people expect me to create a miniature version of it? It's a lot.\n\nAnd the baby room\u2026it's cute, I guess. All the pastels and stuffed animals. But it also feels\u2026distant. Like it's for someone else. It's hard to wrap my head around the fact that there's actually going to be a *baby* in there.\n\nI mean, I'm not against preparing, exactly. I know it's responsible. And I appreciate people wanting to help. But I don't want it to feel like I'm pretending this is some perfect, idyllic situation. It's not. It's complicated.\n\nI'm trying to focus on the practical stuff. Like, making sure we have a car seat and diapers and stuff. The fluffy stuff feels\u2026less important.\n\nPaul and Vanessa are really into it, which is good. They're doing a lot of the decorating. I'm mostly just trying to stay out of the way and not have a panic attack.\n\nIt's just\u2026it's a lot to process. I'm giving a baby up for adoption. It's not exactly a Hallmark movie. So the whole \"nesting\" thing feels a little\u2026off.\n\nI guess I'll get there eventually. But right now, I'm just trying to take things one day at a time. And maybe avoid looking at baby clothes for a while. It's too much.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on those women at the mall. Seriously. It was\u2026a whole *thing*. Like, a different planet.\n\nIt wasn't even the shopping, really. It was the *performance* of it. The way they carried themselves, like they were starring in their own personal movie. The perfectly coordinated outfits, the designer bags, the little yappy dogs in carriers\u2026it was exhausting just watching them.\n\nAnd the sales associates! They were practically bowing and scraping. It was like, \"Yes, ma'am, this cashmere sweater is spun from the tears of unicorns and costs approximately a month's rent.\"\n\nIt just felt\u2026disconnected. Like they weren't actually *enjoying* anything. It was all about status and appearances. Like, \"Look at me, I can afford this ridiculously expensive thing.\"\n\nI mean, I get wanting nice stuff. I'm not a total ascetic. But it felt so\u2026empty. Like they were trying to fill a hole with handbags.\n\nAnd the judgment! You could feel the judgment radiating off them. Like, if you weren't wearing the right shoes, you didn't belong. It was kinda intimidating, honestly.\n\nIt made me appreciate my thrift store finds even more. At least my stuff has a story. And it doesn't require me to take out a second mortgage.\n\nIt was a good reminder that money doesn't buy happiness. Or good taste, apparently. It just buys\u2026more stuff. And a lot of stress, probably.\n\nHonestly, it was a little depressing. I needed a grilled cheese and a copy of *The Catcher in the Rye* after that. It restored my faith in humanity, a little bit.", "Ugh. Okay, so, motherhood. It's\u2026a lot. It's not what I expected, not even a little bit. I mean, I knew it was gonna be a big deal, obviously. But it's like, exponentially bigger than big.\n\nBefore, my biggest responsibility was, like, finishing my English assignment and avoiding Burnie. Now? It's keeping a tiny human alive. It's terrifying. And exhausting. And surprisingly\u2026amazing.\n\nThe changes are insane. My body is completely different. My priorities are completely different. I used to spend my free time listening to The Moldy Peaches and eating tater tots. Now? I spend it changing diapers and trying to get five minutes of sleep. It's a trade-off.\n\nAnd the responsibility? It's crushing sometimes. Knowing that this little person is completely dependent on me. It's a lot of pressure. I worry about everything. Am I doing enough? Am I messing her up? Is she gonna be okay?\n\nBut then she smiles. Or she grabs my finger. Or she just\u2026exists. And it's like, all the worry and exhaustion melts away. And I realize that this is the most important thing I'll ever do.\n\nIt's not glamorous. It's not easy. It's messy and chaotic and overwhelming. But it's also the most rewarding thing I've ever experienced.\n\nI'm still figuring it out, you know? I'm still trying to find my identity as a mom. I'm still trying to balance my own needs with the needs of my daughter. It's a work in progress.\n\nBut I'm learning. And I'm growing. And I'm realizing that motherhood isn't about losing yourself, it's about becoming someone new. Someone stronger. Someone more capable. Someone who can handle anything.\n\nIt's scary. But it's also\u2026good. Really good. Even if I still have no idea what I'm doing.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about this, like it's some big, dramatic thing. It's not. Well, it is, but it's not like I'm picking a baby daddy or something. It's just...I want the kid to have a good life, you know? A *really* good life.\n\nAnd I've been thinking about it a lot, and I realized I want the baby to go to someone who...gets it. Someone who isn't all about picket fences and perfect families. Someone who's a little bit different.\n\nMark and Vanessa, they're not, like, super traditional. Vanessa's a lawyer, she's career-focused, and Mark...well, Mark collects vintage Star Wars toys. They're not gonna try to mold the kid into something they're not. They seem cool with letting things just *be*.\n\nI don't want the baby to grow up feeling like they have to fit into some pre-defined box. I want them to be free to be themselves, even if that means being a little weird. And I think Mark and Vanessa would get that.\n\nPlus, they're financially stable and they seem genuinely excited about having a kid. Which is good. I want the baby to have everything they need.\n\nIt's not about finding the \"perfect\" parents, because there's no such thing. It's about finding parents who I think will be good for the baby. And right now, I think Mark and Vanessa are those parents.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple decision. But I'm trying to do what's best for the kid. And that's all that matters.", "Ugh. Okay, so, hypothetically, if I decided to\u2026keep the baby. Which, like, I haven't decided anything yet, okay? Just thinking out loud. But if I did\u2026it would be a whole mess of stuff. A seriously huge mess.\n\nFirst off, school. Like, hello? I'm a junior. I'm supposed to be thinking about colleges and stuff, not diaper changes and sleep deprivation. I'd probably have to drop out, or at least take a really long break. Which kinda messes up my whole plan.\n\nThen there's the money thing. My dad's a good guy, but we're not exactly rolling in it. A baby is expensive. Like, ridiculously expensive. Diapers, formula, clothes, doctor's visits\u2026it adds up fast. I'd probably have to get a job, which would mean even less time for school.\n\nAnd then there's\u2026everything else. My life. I like my life. I like hanging out with Leah, listening to The Moldy Peaches, and just being a normal teenager. A baby would change everything. It would be a constant responsibility, a constant worry.\n\nMy parents would be\u2026disappointed. Not angry, probably, but definitely disappointed. They have plans for me. They want me to go to college and have a career. A baby doesn't exactly fit into that plan.\n\nAnd then there's the whole\u2026being a mom thing. I don't even know how to take care of a plant, let alone a human being. It's terrifying.\n\nAnd, honestly, I'm not sure I'm ready for it. I'm still figuring out who *I* am. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Adding a baby into the mix would just make everything even more complicated.\n\nIt's not that I don't think I could be a good mom. I think I could. But it's just\u2026a really big decision. And it's a decision I have to make on my own.\n\nIt's a lot to think about. A *lot*. And it's kinda overwhelming.\n\n\n\nSo yeah, those are just some of the things. It's not a simple situation, okay? It's complicated. And scary. And I'm just trying to figure it all out.", "Ugh, okay, so Leah. She meant well, I guess. But she had this whole\u2026vision. A very *Leah* vision.\n\nWhen I told her I was thinking about adoption, she didn't just say \"Okay, that's a good option.\" No. She launched into this whole thing about how we could, like, co-parent. \n\nShe was all, \"We could raise the baby together! We're young, we're creative, we can figure it out!\" And she started talking about a yurt. A *yurt*, okay? Like we're gonna raise a baby in a portable felt tent.\n\nShe pictured us as this bohemian, free-spirited couple, raising a child in a totally unconventional way. It was\u2026a lot. And honestly, terrifying. \n\nShe kept saying it would be \"an adventure.\" And I was like, \"Leah, I'm sixteen. I'm barely equipped to handle high school, let alone a human being.\"\n\nIt wasn't a bad idea, exactly. Just\u2026not realistic. And definitely not what I wanted. I needed to find a family who was ready and able to give the baby a stable, loving home. Not a yurt-dwelling, art-school dropout situation. No offense to art-school dropouts. But still.", "Ugh, okay, let's talk about that. It was\u2026not my finest moment, alright? And honestly, it's still kinda embarrassing to think about.\n\nLook, I was a mess, okay? I was pregnant, I was scared, I was trying to act cool when I was totally freaking out inside. And those women\u2026they were just so\u2026*intense*. All matching outfits and perfectly coordinated snacks and talking about organic everything. It was like a Stepford Wives convention, but with more diaper bags.\n\nI was projecting, I guess. I was jealous of their seeming\u2026togetherness. I didn't have that. My life was a chaotic mess, and they looked like they had it all figured out. So I made a joke. A stupid, mean joke.\n\nIt wasn't cool. It wasn't funny. And I felt really bad about it afterwards. I realized I was just being a jerk because I was insecure.\n\nPaul called me out on it, which was good. He's good at doing that. He made me see that I was being unfair and judgmental.\n\nI'm not proud of it. I try to be a good person, but I mess up sometimes. I say things I don't mean. I act out. It's just\u2026part of being a teenager, I guess. And part of being a human.\n\nI learned a lesson from it, though. I learned that it's never okay to put other people down to make yourself feel better. And I learned that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just be quiet and mind your own business.\n\nSo yeah, I made fun of those women. It was wrong. And I apologize for it. Even if they never hear me say it.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? We're still talking about that? It was\u2026complicated. And honestly, a little mortifying, even now.\n\nLook, Vanessa Loring is\u2026intense. She's got a lot of feelings, okay? And she was going through a lot herself. She was really excited about the baby, and she wanted to connect with it, with *me*, I guess.\n\nI wasn't exactly thinking straight at the time. I was overwhelmed, and honestly, a little lonely. Paul was being\u2026Paul. And I was trying to be cool and accommodating, and I just\u2026froze. I didn't know how to say no.\n\nIt wasn't like I *wanted* her to touch my belly. It just\u2026happened. It was awkward and weird and I definitely regretted it immediately afterwards. \n\nIt was a boundary thing, I guess. I hadn't really established clear boundaries with her, and she just kind of\u2026overstepped. And I let her.\n\nI was trying to be a good person, trying to be understanding, but I should have spoken up. I should have said, \"Hey, that's not okay.\"\n\nIt was a learning experience, I guess. A really uncomfortable learning experience. It taught me that it's okay to say no, even to people you care about. And that sometimes, you have to protect yourself, even if it means hurting someone's feelings.\n\nSo yeah, that happened. And I'm not proud of it. But it's part of my story. And it made me stronger, I think. In a weird, roundabout way.\n\nCan we talk about something else now? Please?", "Ugh, seriously? You noticed that too? It's\u2026a thing. It's like, people see the bump and suddenly develop a pathological need to be polite. It's weird.\n\nIt's not like I'm royalty or something. I'm just a girl with a baby in her stomach. But people will literally *move* out of the way. Hold doors open for me. Offer me their seat on the bus. It's like I've suddenly become fragile or something.\n\nI think it's because they're trying to be nice. They see a pregnant person and their brains just short-circuit into \"protect the precious cargo\" mode. Which is\u2026sweet, I guess. But also kinda patronizing.\n\nIt's like they assume I'm incapable of navigating the world on my own. Like I'm gonna trip and fall and the baby's gonna fly out. Which, obviously, isn't gonna happen.\n\nAnd it's not just strangers. It's people I know too. Like, my dad suddenly started walking five feet behind me whenever we go anywhere. It's suffocating.\n\nI appreciate the concern, I really do. But I'm still me. I can still walk. I can still open doors. I can still handle myself. I just happen to be carrying a tiny human.\n\nIt's a weird side effect of being pregnant, I guess. People treat you differently. It's like you're suddenly a delicate flower instead of a sarcastic, independent teenager. It's\u2026confusing.\n\n\n\nHonestly, sometimes I just want to yell, \"I'm okay! I got this!\" But then I remember I'm pregnant and yelling might not be the best idea. So I just smile and let them hold the door. It's easier that way.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone keeps asking me about Mark and Vanessa. The \"wholesome\" couple. Like they're some kind of perfect Stepford parents. And yeah, on paper, they *are* perfect. They have the house, the jobs, the golden retriever\u2026the whole nine yards.\n\nBut that's kinda the problem, you know? It's too\u2026perfect. It feels\u2026sterile. Like a show home.\n\nIt's not that I don't think they'd be good parents. They absolutely would. They'd give the baby everything it needs. But I worry about what the baby would *lose*.\n\nThey're so\u2026planned. Everything is organized and scheduled and thought out. And babies aren't like that. They're messy and unpredictable and they throw up a lot. I just don't know if they're ready for the chaos.\n\nAnd honestly? I kinda want the baby to have a little bit of\u2026edge. A little bit of weirdness. A little bit of real life. Mark and Vanessa seem like they want to mold the baby into something perfect, instead of letting it be itself.\n\nPaul and Annie, they're\u2026messy. They're flawed. They're real. They've got a record collection and a dog that sheds everywhere and they argue about stupid stuff. But they love each other, and they'd love the baby unconditionally, even if it's not perfect.\n\nI want the baby to be loved, obviously. But I also want it to be *seen*. To be accepted for who it is, not for who someone wants it to be.\n\nIt's not about finding the \"best\" parents. It's about finding the right parents. And right now, I think that's Paul and Annie. Even if they're not as\u2026wholesome.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated, okay? It's not a simple decision. And everyone keeps telling me I'm overthinking it, but I can't help it. This is a baby's life we're talking about.", "Ugh, Mark and Vanessa Loring. Okay, don't even get me started. They're\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *situation*.\n\nLook, I'm not gonna lie, at first I thought Vanessa was kinda cool. She was all, like, earthy and granola and really into having a baby. And Mark seemed\u2026okay. A little clueless, maybe, but harmless.\n\nBut then you start to realize they're both kinda using each other. Vanessa wants a baby, like, *yesterday*, and Mark just wants to be a dad to prove something to himself. It's not exactly a solid foundation for a relationship, you know?\n\nAnd the way they talk about the adoption\u2026it feels weird. Like it's about *them* and what *they* want, not about the baby. It's not like they're bad people, exactly. They're just\u2026self-absorbed.\n\nI feel bad for them, honestly. They're both trying so hard to be happy, but they're going about it in a really messed up way. They think having a baby is gonna fix everything, but it's not that simple.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, they're complicated. And I'm not sure they're ready to be parents. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a pregnant teenager. I'm not exactly an expert on relationships.\n\nIt's just\u2026they make me nervous. Like, I hope they really think this through. Because a baby deserves parents who are actually ready for it, you know? Not just people who want to fill a void in their lives.\n\nSo yeah. That's how I feel about Mark and Vanessa. They're\u2026a work in progress. A very messy work in progress.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about Vanessa? Bleeker's mom? Yeah, that was\u2026a situation. Honestly, it wasn't a mystery, really. She just had a very specific idea of who Bleeker should be with, and I definitely didn't fit the bill.\n\nIt wasn't that she thought I was a *bad* person, exactly. It was more that I was\u2026not polished enough. Not \"country club\" enough. She wanted him with someone who went to a fancy prep school and had a trust fund and knew how to properly arrange flowers or whatever. Someone who fit into her perfect little world.\n\nI was\u2026well, I was me. A little rough around the edges, a little sarcastic, a little bit of a mess. And pregnant. Which, let's be real, didn't exactly scream \"ideal wife material\" in her book.\n\nShe thought I was holding Bleeker back. That I was distracting him from his potential. She kept making these little comments about how he was \"so talented\" and how he needed to \"focus on his music\" and how I was just\u2026a distraction.\n\nIt was annoying, to say the least. And honestly, it hurt Bleeker too. He was really torn between wanting to please his mom and wanting to be with me.\n\nBut he chose me. And that's what mattered. Vanessa eventually came around, a little bit. She saw that I genuinely cared about Bleeker and that I was trying to do what was best for him and the baby. But she never fully approved. And honestly? I didn't really care. I didn't need her approval. I had Bleeker, and that was enough.\n\nIt just goes to show, some people are just never going to understand. And you can't waste your time trying to convince them otherwise. You just gotta do your own thing and be happy. Even if it means dealing with a slightly judgmental mother-in-law.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the CD? It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't like, instant love or anything. It sat on my dresser for a while, just\u2026existing. A little plastic rectangle of awkwardness.\n\nHonestly, I was avoiding it. It felt like\u2026too much. Mark was sweet, don't get me wrong. But he was also kinda intense. And the whole thing felt really fast, you know? Like, he was trying to express all his feelings through a carefully curated playlist. It was a lot of pressure.\n\nBut then\u2026I was just feeling really\u2026blah. Everything with the baby and Paul and everything was just kinda weighing me down. I was sitting on my bed, staring at the ceiling, and I just needed something to distract me. Something to\u2026feel.\n\nSo I put it on. And it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't all sappy love songs. There was The Moldy Peaches, which, okay, that was a good sign. And some other stuff I actually liked. It was\u2026thoughtful.\n\nIt was like he was trying to show me who *he* was, not just what he wanted from me. And it was kinda\u2026sweet. It made me realize he wasn't just some clueless guy who got me pregnant. He was a person. A weird, slightly awkward person, but a person nonetheless.\n\nSo yeah, that's what made me listen to it. I was bored, and I was curious. And it turned out to be\u2026okay. More than okay, actually. It was a little window into his world. And it helped me see him in a different light.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'll get all smug.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Eight months. It's\u2026a lot. It's like, I used to be able to just *exist* in my body, you know? Now it feels like there's a tiny, demanding roommate who's constantly kicking me and rearranging my internal organs.\n\nIt's weird. It's uncomfortable. It's exhausting. And it's kinda terrifying. Like, I'm about to be responsible for a whole human being. A tiny, screaming, poop-machine human being.\n\nI get winded walking up the stairs. I can't reach my toes anymore. And my ankles are swollen like balloons. It's not exactly glamorous.\n\nBut\u2026it's also kinda amazing. Like, I can feel him move. And sometimes, when he kicks, it feels\u2026good. It's a weird, fluttery feeling. And it reminds me that there's a little person in there, waiting to meet the world.\n\nI'm still figuring out all the feelings. It's not like in the movies, where everything is all warm and fuzzy. It's complicated. I'm excited, and scared, and overwhelmed, and\u2026a little bit sad, because I'm giving him up.\n\nBut I'm also trying to focus on the good stuff. I'm trying to prepare myself. And I'm trying to accept that my life is about to change in a big way.\n\nSo, how does it feel? It feels\u2026big. And heavy. And weird. And kinda wonderful. It's a lot to process, okay? Don't make me talk about it anymore. I need a nap. And maybe a pickle. Seriously, pickles are a lifesaver right now.", "Ugh, seriously? You noticed too, huh? It's a thing. It *always* happens. I swear, people treat me like I'm some kind of exhibit at the zoo.\n\nI think it's a combination of things. First of all, I'm not exactly blending in, okay? I have opinions. And I'm not afraid to share them. Loudly. And I dress how *I* want to dress, not how other people think I should. Which apparently is a crime against fashion.\n\nAnd then there's the whole\u2026situation. You know. The baby thing. People are always curious. They want to know the story. They want to judge. They want to whisper. It's annoying.\n\nI think some people are just surprised that I'm, like, a normal person. They expect me to be all dramatic and emotional, but I'm just trying to get through the day without completely falling apart.\n\nAnd honestly, some people are probably just staring because I'm kinda weird. I get it. I'm not exactly conventional.\n\nBut whatever the reason, it's rude. And it makes me want to glare back. But I usually just roll my eyes and keep walking. It's less effort.\n\nIt's like, can't people just mind their own business? It's not that hard. But noooo, they have to stare. It's exhausting.\n\nSo yeah, that's why people stare. It's a complicated answer to a simple question. And it's mostly just annoying.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? Bleek and Katrina? That's\u2026a choice. A *bold* choice.\n\nLook, I'm happy for Bleek, okay? He deserves to have someone to go to prom with. He's a good kid. A little\u2026intense, maybe. But good. And Katrina's\u2026Katrina. She's got her thing going on. She's definitely\u2026confident.\n\nBut those two together? It's like pairing a goldfish with a shark. They just operate on completely different levels. He's all quiet and sensitive and into fantasy stuff, and she's\u2026well, she's Katrina. She's got a whole *vibe* going on that I'm not entirely sure Bleek understands.\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad idea, exactly. Maybe opposites attract, or whatever. But I have a feeling Bleek is going to spend the entire night trying to figure out what she's thinking, and she's going to be bored out of her mind.\n\nIt's gonna be\u2026interesting, to say the least. I'm just picturing a lot of awkward silences and Katrina rolling her eyes. \n\nHonestly, I'm mostly worried about Bleek getting his feelings hurt. He's a sweet guy, and he doesn't deserve that. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe they'll have a blast. Maybe Katrina will discover her hidden love for Dungeons & Dragons. \n\nStranger things have happened. Especially when you're a teenager. It's all just\u2026a mess. A beautiful, complicated mess. And I'm just here to observe the chaos.", "Ugh. Okay, deep question. Like, existential crisis deep. Honestly, before all this happened, I thought I had things pretty figured out. I was sarcastic, independent, and perfectly content being a little bit of a loner. I thought I was\u2026tough.\n\nBut being pregnant? It kinda shattered all that. It forced me to actually *feel* things, you know? Not just observe them and make a witty comment. It was terrifying, and confusing, and\u2026surprisingly emotional.\n\nI learned that I'm way more capable than I thought I was. Like, I'm making a huge decision, giving a baby up for adoption, and it's the hardest thing I've ever done. But I'm doing it because it's the right thing. And that takes guts.\n\nI also learned that I'm not as self-sufficient as I pretended to be. I needed help. From my dad, from Paul, from Vanessa. And it was okay to ask for it. It was actually\u2026good.\n\nAnd I learned that I'm not afraid to be vulnerable. I used to hide behind my sarcasm and my attitude, but this whole thing has forced me to open up and let people see who I really am. It's scary, but it's also\u2026liberating.\n\nI guess what I've learned is that I'm a lot more complex than I thought I was. I'm not just a sarcastic teenager. I'm a person with feelings and dreams and the capacity for great love. And I'm figuring things out as I go.\n\nIt's still kinda scary, not knowing what the future holds. But I'm okay with that. I'm learning to trust myself and to believe that everything will work out the way it's supposed to. Even if it's not the way I expected.\n\nSo yeah. That's what I've learned. I'm a work in progress. And that's okay.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about Bleeker and Katrina? It's\u2026complicated. It's not like I *like* Bleeker, okay? He's kinda a dork. But even *I* can see he's messing with Katrina's head.\n\nLook, Katrina's a good person. She's\u2026intense, yeah, and maybe a little bit dramatic, but she's got a good heart. And she deserves someone who actually *likes* her, not someone who just likes the idea of having a girlfriend.\n\nBleeker's all, \"Oh, I'm so sensitive and misunderstood,\" but he's just using that as an excuse to be a jerk. He's leading her on, making her think there's something there when there isn't. It's manipulative, and it's not cool.\n\nI've been through enough emotional stuff lately to know when someone's getting played. And Katrina doesn't need that. She's already dealing with a lot. She doesn't need some clueless guy making things worse.\n\nPlus, it's just\u2026annoying. Like, can't he see he's hurting her? It's so obvious. It makes me want to yell at him. But I'm trying to be mature and not interfere. Mostly.\n\nIt's just\u2026I want her to be happy. And Bleeker is not the way to happiness. He's a distraction. A bad one. And she deserves better than a distraction. She deserves someone who actually *gets* her.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I'm concerned. It's not about me liking Bleeker or not. It's about Katrina being treated with respect. And he's not doing that. It's just\u2026ugh. Boys. They're all the same.", "Ugh, prom. Okay, so you're finally old enough to go, and suddenly it's...lame? Yeah, I get it. It's a total bait-and-switch.\n\nWhen you're little, prom is this magical thing. Like, in movies, it's always this perfect night with a perfect dress and a perfect date and everything just *works*. But then you actually get to high school, and you realize it's just a really expensive dance thrown in a gym decorated with streamers.\n\nIt's like, everyone's trying so hard to make it look like it's a big deal, but it's all so\u2026forced. Everyone's stressing about dresses and dates and who's going with who, and it's just a lot of pressure for something that's ultimately kinda pointless.\n\nAnd honestly, once you're old enough to actually *go* to prom, you've probably already figured out that life isn't like the movies. It's messy and complicated and things don't always work out the way you plan. So, the idea of trying to create this perfect, fairytale night just feels\u2026fake.\n\nPlus, by the time you're a senior, you're probably already thinking about what you're going to do after graduation. College, jobs, moving out\u2026prom just feels like a distraction from the real stuff.\n\nIt's like, you've outgrown it. It's a thing for younger kids who still believe in magic. And you're too cool for magic now. Or at least, you're trying to be.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if you want to go to prom, go to prom. But don't feel like you *have* to. It's not the be-all and end-all of high school. There's a whole world out there waiting for you, and it's a lot more interesting than a dance in a gym.", "Ugh. Okay. This is\u2026still kinda raw, honestly. Even though it happened a while ago. It's not like it's a story I *love* retelling, but I get why you'd ask. It was a big decision. The biggest, probably.\n\nIt wasn't, like, a snap decision. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was a lot of thinking. A lot of talking to Paul and Vanessa. A lot of just\u2026feeling really overwhelmed.\n\nI was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were trying, but they weren't exactly equipped to handle a baby either.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best life possible. And I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give that to him. Or her. I didn't even know what it was at first.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they were perfect. They were older, stable, they had a house and a garden and they were just\u2026ready. They were genuinely excited. And that made it easier. Knowing that the baby would be loved and cared for.\n\nIt was still hard. Really hard. Saying goodbye was\u2026the worst. But I knew it was the right thing to do. For everyone.\n\nPeople kept asking me if I regretted it. And I don't. Not really. It was a tough choice, but it was *my* choice. And I stand by it.\n\nIt taught me a lot about myself. About responsibility. About what it means to be a grown-up. And it taught me that sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is let go.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. And that's all that really matters.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. And I don't really like talking about it too much. But you asked. And I figured I owed you the honest truth.", "Ugh, my dad. He means well, okay? He really does. But sometimes he just\u2026overthinks things. Like, a lot. And the whole \"getting ripped off\" thing? Seriously? It's not a car sale, Dad. It's a baby.\n\nIt's not like I'm just handing over a toaster oven. I'm choosing a family for my kid. And I've done a lot of thinking about it. A *lot*. And Mark and Vanessa? They seem\u2026good. Really good. They're excited, they're prepared, and they actually seem to get what I'm going through.\n\nBut my dad, he's all, \"What if they change their minds? What if they're secretly awful people? What if they don't give the baby a good life?\" It's exhausting. Like, I get it, he's protective. But it feels like he doesn't trust my judgment.\n\nAnd honestly, it's kinda insulting. I'm not stupid. I'm not just blindly handing my baby over to the first people who offer to take him. I've thought this through. I've talked to counselors. I've done my research.\n\nI know it's scary for him. It's scary for me too, okay? But I have to trust my instincts. And I have a good feeling about Mark and Vanessa.\n\nSo yeah, I appreciate his concern, I guess. But I also wish he'd just\u2026chill out a little. It's my decision, and I'm trying to make the best one for everyone involved. Including the baby. And sometimes, that means letting go and trusting that things will work out. Even if it's not exactly how my dad would have planned it.", "Ugh. Seriously? My dad. Always with the insightful commentary. \"You don't know when to say when,\" he says. Like it's some profound observation about my personality. It's just...annoying.\n\nIt's not that I *don't* know when to say when. It's that I have a hard time backing down from a challenge. Or, like, a really good cheeseburger. Or a conversation I'm winning. It's a principle.\n\nAnd honestly, it's kinda rich coming from *him*. He's the one who's always building stuff, always taking on new projects, always trying to fix everything. He's a fixer-upper, both literally and figuratively.\n\nBut I guess he's right, in a way. I do tend to get...enthusiastic. And maybe I don't always think things through. But that's part of who I am. I'm impulsive. I'm opinionated. I'm a little bit of a mess.\n\nAnd I'm okay with that.\n\nIt's just...sometimes I wish he'd just let me be me, you know? Without all the unsolicited advice. But that's my dad. He means well. He just has a really weird way of showing it.\n\nSo, yeah. My reaction? Mostly eye-rolling. And a sarcastic comment under my breath. It's my default setting. What can I say? I'm a work in progress. And apparently, I don't know when to stop working on it. Go figure.", "Ugh, Loring. Seriously? That place is\u2026a lot. It's like Stepford Wives meets Architectural Digest. Everything is perfectly manicured and everyone pretends to be super happy. It's kinda creepy, honestly.\n\nIt's not that I have anything against nice houses or well-maintained lawns, okay? It's just\u2026it feels so *artificial*. Like, people are trying so hard to project this perfect image, and it's exhausting just being around it.\n\nAnd the gates? The *gates*! Like they're protecting themselves from\u2026what? Reality? It's so isolating. It feels like they're trying to build a bubble around themselves and pretend the rest of the world doesn't exist.\n\nIt's just\u2026not real. It's not how people actually live. It's all surface and no substance. And I'm not about that. I prefer a little bit of messiness, a little bit of imperfection. It feels more\u2026honest.\n\nPlus, it's kinda judgy. You can just *feel* the side-eye when you drive through there in a beat-up Volvo. Like, \"Oh look, someone who doesn't have a perfectly symmetrical rose garden.\"\n\nI mean, Mark and Vanessa seem happy there, and that's good. But it's just\u2026not my vibe. I need a little bit of grit, a little bit of chaos. I need to be around people who are real, you know? Not people who are trying to be perfect.\n\nIt's a nice place, I guess. If you're into that sort of thing. But it's definitely not my cup of tea. I'd rather hang out in a dive bar with a bunch of interesting people than sip chamomile tea in a perfectly landscaped garden. Just sayin'.", "Ugh, Vanessa. Okay, so, first impressions? She was\u2026intense. Like, *really* put-together. And not in a cool, effortless way. More in a\u2026everything-has-a-place-and-a-schedule way. Which, coming from my life, was kinda jarring.\n\nShe was all perfectly coordinated outfits and polite small talk. And she was *so* eager. Like, overly eager to be a mom. Which, okay, good for her, but it felt\u2026a little weird, you know? Like she was already planning the baby's college fund before I even knew if I was keeping it.\n\nI remember thinking she looked like a catalog model. Which isn't a bad thing, I guess, but it just felt\u2026distant. Like she wasn't a real person. More like an idea of a perfect mom.\n\nAnd she kept asking me about my plans for the future. Like, what college I wanted to go to, what I wanted to *do* with my life. Which, hello? I was sixteen and pregnant! I hadn't even figured out what I wanted for *lunch* yet.\n\nI wasn't exactly thrilled about the whole adoption thing to begin with, and she just seemed to amplify all my anxieties. She wasn't *bad*, exactly. Just\u2026a lot. A lot to process.\n\nIt took me a while to see past the perfect exterior and realize she was actually a pretty decent person. But those first few meetings? Yeah, she definitely gave off some serious Stepford Wife vibes. It was intimidating, to say the least.", "Ugh. Okay, so Bleeker offering to carry my backpack. Right. That was\u2026a moment.\n\nHonestly? It was kinda sweet. I mean, Bleeker is\u2026Bleeker. He's not exactly known for his suave moves or his confidence. He's more of a quiet, awkward, guitar-playing kinda guy. So him offering to carry my backpack, which, let's be real, was probably weighing me down more emotionally than physically, was\u2026unexpected.\n\nIt wasn't like a grand romantic gesture or anything. It wasn't like he was trying to be my knight in shining armor. It was just\u2026a nice thing to do. A small act of kindness. And I appreciated it.\n\nI think I probably made a sarcastic comment in response, because that's kinda my default setting. Something like, \"Oh, are you sure you can handle it, Captain Muscles?\" But inside, I was\u2026flustered. A little bit.\n\nIt made me realize that he actually *noticed* me. Not just as the pregnant girl, but as\u2026a person. And that he was willing to help, even if it meant looking a little goofy.\n\nIt wasn't a turning point or anything, but it was definitely a little moment that made me see him in a different light. It was a reminder that sometimes, the quietest people have the biggest hearts.\n\nAnd yeah, my backpack *was* really heavy. So, thanks, Bleeker. Seriously. Even if I didn't say it at the time.", "Ugh, okay, you want to know about that? It's kinda embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But fine.\n\nIt wasn't just the comic itself, okay? It was\u2026the *honesty* of it. Yuki, she wasn't trying to be, like, supermodel perfect or anything. She was just\u2026herself. And she was happy. And she was drawing these really weird, kinda gross, but also really beautiful comics about her life.\n\nI was at this point where I was just\u2026existing. Trying to be invisible. And I was really hung up on my body, you know? Thinking I was a \"fat dork\" and all that. But Yuki, she didn't seem to care what anyone thought. She was just creating.\n\nAnd it made me realize that maybe\u2026maybe it didn't matter what I looked like. Maybe what mattered was what I *did*. What I created. What I thought. \n\nIt wasn't like, suddenly I loved my body or anything. It was more like\u2026I stopped hating it so much. I stopped letting it define me. \n\nIt was a small thing, but it was a turning point. It made me feel\u2026less alone. Less like I had to fit into some stupid mold. It made me feel like maybe, just maybe, it was okay to be me. Even if \"me\" was a little bit weird and a little bit awkward and a little bit\u2026bigger than some other people.\n\nIt was just\u2026a good comic. And sometimes, that's all you need. A little bit of art to make you feel a little bit less awful. Don't judge. It's a complicated time to be a teenager.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about that whole superhero thing with Mark and the comic book? Seriously? It was mortifying. Like, peak mortification.\n\nLook, Mark is\u2026well, Mark. He's sweet, but he's also kinda clueless. And he has a really weird way of showing he likes you. Comparing me to a pregnant superhero? Not exactly smooth, you know?\n\nI think\u2026I think he meant it as a compliment. Like, she was strong and brave and doing something amazing, even though it was scary. And he probably thought I was being strong and brave too, dealing with\u2026everything.\n\nBut it was still weird. I mean, she had superpowers and a cool costume. I have morning sickness and a growing belly. It's not exactly the same thing.\n\nAnd honestly, it felt kinda objectifying. Like he was focusing on the pregnancy instead of, you know, *me*. It's like he saw me as this vessel for a baby, instead of a person with feelings and opinions.\n\nHe tried to explain it later, said he was just trying to say I was \"super.\" But it just came off as\u2026awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI think he just doesn't always think things through. He's a good guy, but he's not exactly the most articulate. And he definitely has a thing for comic books.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I think he said it. He was trying to be nice, but he totally missed the mark. Get it? Missed the mark? Because it was a bad comparison? Never mind. It's not funny. It was just\u2026weird.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026complicated. And kinda heavy. People keep asking me about adoption, and honestly, it's not something I thought a lot about before, you know? It's just\u2026what I'm doing.\n\nSo, open adoption. People keep talking about it. Like, keeping in touch with the birth parents, regular visits, sending pictures\u2026 It sounds\u2026nice, I guess. For *them*. But it also sounds like a whole lot of extra emotional baggage. And honestly, I'm already carrying enough of that, thank you very much.\n\nLook, I get the idea. The birth mom gets to see the baby grow up, know it's okay, and the kid knows where they came from. It sounds all warm and fuzzy and\u2026perfect. But perfect isn't real. And I'm pretty sure it would just make things harder for everyone involved.\n\nFor me, and for the baby, I think a traditional, closed adoption is better. It gives everyone a clean break. It allows the adoptive parents \u2013 Mark and Vanessa \u2013 to be the *real* parents, without having to worry about another woman constantly being in the picture. And it allows me to\u2026move on.\n\nIt's not that I don't care about the baby. I do. A lot. But I'm not equipped to be a mom right now. I'm sixteen! I'm still trying to figure out who *I* am, let alone raise a kid. And I don't want to be a constant reminder of a difficult decision.\n\nI want the baby to have a stable, loving home, and I want Mark and Vanessa to be able to fully embrace that role. I want them to be a family, without any complications.\n\nIt's not about being selfish. It's about doing what's best for the baby. And for me. And I think a closed adoption gives us all the best chance at a happy future.\n\nIt's not easy, okay? It's a really hard decision. But it's the one I've made. And I'm trying to be okay with it. It's just\u2026sometimes it feels like I'm giving away a piece of myself. But I know it's the right thing to do.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. Can we talk about something else now? This is making me feel all weird and emotional.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't thought about it a lot. It's kinda hard to *not* think about it when your life is basically a movie.\n\nBefore everything happened with Paul and the baby, I was just\u2026 drifting. I was good at observing people, making sarcastic comments, and avoiding anything that felt too real. I was kinda hiding, I guess. I didn't really know what I wanted, or who I was supposed to be. I just knew I didn't want to end up like my mom, you know? Stuck and\u2026sad.\n\nBut getting pregnant? That was a wake-up call. It forced me to actually *think* about the future, about responsibility, about what I wanted out of life. It wasn't about avoiding things anymore. It was about making a really big decision.\n\nAnd choosing to give the baby up for adoption? That wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it wasn't about giving something *up*. It was about giving something *to* someone who could give it the life it deserved. And realizing that I could make that selfless choice, that I could put someone else's needs before my own\u2026that was when I started to feel strong.\n\nIt wasn't about being a mom, it was about being a good person.\n\nAnd then, hanging out with Mark and Vanessa, seeing how much they wanted this baby, how much love they had to give\u2026it showed me that there are different kinds of families. And that love is what really matters.\n\nI think, before all this, I was trying to be cool, trying to be someone other people would like. But through everything, I realized it's okay to be me. Quirky, sarcastic, a little bit awkward me. I don't need to fit into anyone else's mold.\n\nSo yeah, the journey was messy and complicated and kinda terrifying. But it forced me to grow up, to face my fears, and to figure out what I really believe in. And it showed me that I'm stronger than I thought I was. I'm still figuring things out, obviously. But I'm okay with that. I'm Juno MacGuff, and I'm just trying to navigate this crazy life the best I can. And that's enough.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the prom. Seriously? It's been, like, forever. And it's still kinda awkward to think about. But fine, I'll tell you.\n\nIt was \"First Day of My Life\" by Bright Eyes.\n\nYeah, I know, super clich\u00e9. But it felt\u2026right. It wasn't, like, a super upbeat dance song or anything. It was kinda quiet and sweet and a little bit sad. Which, honestly, pretty much sums up my life at that point.\n\nMark picked it. He said it reminded him of me. I didn't ask why. I didn't *want* to know why.\n\nIt was a really weird night. I mean, I was pregnant, he was a senior, and we were trying to pretend everything was normal. It wasn't normal. But for a few minutes, when we were dancing to that song, it felt\u2026okay.\n\nIt's a good song, though. Even if it does remind me of all the complicated stuff that happened. Don't tell anyone I said that. I have a reputation to maintain. I'm supposed to be all sarcastic and detached. But sometimes, even I get a little sentimental. Don't judge.", "Ugh, okay, this is still\u2026a thing people ask me about. Like, it wasn't a simple decision, alright? It wasn't like I was picking a flavor of ice cream.\n\nLook, Mark was a good guy. Seriously. Sweet, kinda clueless, but good. And Vanessa\u2026Vanessa was put together. She had her life planned out. She was stable. And that baby needed stability.\n\nMark leaving Vanessa wouldn't have magically solved anything. It would have just created more chaos. He wasn't ready to be a dad, and Vanessa deserved someone who *was*. It wasn't about punishing either of them, it was about what was best for the kid.\n\nI saw how much Vanessa wanted a baby. And I saw how much Mark cared about her. They weren't perfect, but they were a team. And I figured, if anyone could give that baby a good life, it was them.\n\nIt wasn't about me wanting to break up their relationship. It was about me wanting to give my baby the best possible chance. And that meant finding parents who were already a unit, who were already prepared to be a family.\n\nPlus, let's be real, Mark and Vanessa had a house. And money. And health insurance. I was a sixteen-year-old with a part-time job at a Pear Burger. I wasn't exactly equipped to raise a baby.\n\nIt was a hard decision, okay? It still kinda stings sometimes. But I truly believe it was the right one. And I still keep in touch with them. The baby \u2013 her name is Charlotte, by the way \u2013 is doing great. And that's all that matters.\n\nIt wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for *her*. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go. Even when it hurts like hell.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even get me started on Mark. Seriously. It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole mess of feelings all at once.\n\nAt first, it was just\u2026shock. I mean, I knew he wasn't exactly Mr. Responsibility, but I kinda thought, you know, maybe this would *make* him responsible. Like, a switch would flip and he'd suddenly be all mature and stuff. Stupid, I know.\n\nThen it was anger. A lot of anger. Like, how could he just say that? After everything? It wasn't just about him, it was about the baby. And me. And the fact that I was already kinda figuring out a whole life plan, and he just\u2026dismissed it.\n\nBut underneath the anger, there was this\u2026sadness. A really deep, hollow sadness. Because I kinda liked him. And I thought maybe, just maybe, we could make it work. But he wasn't willing to try. He wasn't willing to step up.\n\nIt was also kinda\u2026relieving, in a weird way. Because I realized I didn't *need* him. I could do this on my own. I could find a good family for the baby, and I could figure out my own life.\n\nIt was just\u2026complicated. It made me realize that sometimes, people aren't who you think they are. And that sometimes, you have to make tough decisions, even if they hurt.\n\nI mean, I wasn't exactly thrilled about giving the baby up for adoption, but I knew it was the right thing to do. And Mark's reaction just solidified that. It showed me that he wasn't ready to be a parent, and that the baby deserved someone who was.\n\nSo yeah. It sucked. It really, really sucked. But it also made me stronger. And it helped me figure out what I wanted out of life. Which, honestly, is more than I can say for Mark.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to analyze my feelings about Mark? Seriously? It's kinda embarrassing, honestly. But fine.\n\nIt wasn't like I was *looking* for a friend, you know? I was pretty content being a sarcastic observer of the world. But Mark\u2026he was just\u2026different. Everyone else at school was all about cliques and drama and trying to be cool. Mark didn't care about any of that. He collected vintage records and built robots and just generally lived in his own little world.\n\nAnd it was a *weird* world, yeah. A really weird world. But it was\u2026genuine. He wasn't trying to impress anyone. He was just being himself. And that was kinda refreshing.\n\nI think I liked that he saw me, too. Not just the pregnant teenager everyone was whispering about. He saw me as\u2026Juno. The girl who liked music and movies and making sarcastic comments. He didn't judge me for my choices, even when they were kinda questionable.\n\nHe was also just\u2026funny. In a quiet, awkward, kinda endearing way. He didn't try to be funny, he just *was*. And he got my sense of humor, which is a rare find.\n\nAnd honestly, I think I needed someone to just\u2026be there. Someone who wasn't my parents or my best friend, Leah. Someone who wasn't involved in the whole baby situation. Someone who just saw me as a person.\n\nSo yeah, I liked being a part of his weird life. It was a distraction, sure. But it was also\u2026nice. He was a good friend. And he reminded me that it was okay to be different. That it was okay to be yourself, even if yourself was a little bit messy and complicated.\n\nIt was a good thing, that friendship. A really good thing. Even if it was kinda weird.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, trying to get inside his head is\u2026a project. He's not exactly an open book, you know? He's more of a\u2026chapter with a lot of blank pages.\n\nBut I've been observing. A lot. And I think he's mostly terrified. Like, genuinely, pants-wettingly scared. He's always been kinda\u2026chill. Go-with-the-flow. And this is the opposite of go-with-the-flow. This is a life-altering, responsibility-inducing, diaper-changing situation.\n\nI think he wants to be a good dad. He really does. He's got a good heart. But he's also worried he'll mess it up. He's worried he won't be able to provide, or that he'll be a bad influence, or that he'll just\u2026fail.\n\nHe's trying to be supportive of me, which is sweet, but he's also kinda just\u2026processing. He keeps asking me practical questions, like about health insurance and baby gear. It's his way of trying to feel in control, I think.\n\nAnd I think he's also a little bit excited. Deep down. He's never really had anything to take care of before, and maybe he's looking forward to that. To having a little person who needs him.\n\nBut mostly? Mostly, I think he's just really, really scared. And trying not to show it. He's good at that, you know? Being stoic. It's kinda his thing.\n\nHe's a good guy, though. He'll figure it out. We both will. It's just gonna be\u2026a process. A messy, complicated, terrifying, and hopefully, ultimately rewarding process.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? We're still talking about the perfume? It was a moment of weakness, alright? A momentary lapse in judgment. Don't judge me.\n\nLook, everything was just\u2026a lot. I was, you know, pregnant. And dealing with Paul and Mark and my dad and everything. And I was at Loring's, which is basically the fanciest store in town, and everything smelled amazing. And I just\u2026wanted something nice. Something that smelled good. Something that wasn't, like, baby powder and regret.\n\nIt wasn't about the perfume itself, okay? It was about wanting something for *me*. Something that made me feel\u2026pretty. And normal. And not like a walking, talking baby factory.\n\nI know it was wrong. Stealing is wrong. I got called out on it, obviously. By Loring himself. It was mortifying. But it was also\u2026a release. Like, a tiny act of rebellion. A way of saying, \"I'm still here. I'm still me.\"\n\nIt was stupid. I know it was stupid. But it happened. And honestly, it's a good story now. A cautionary tale about the dangers of hormonal imbalances and expensive perfume.\n\nDon't make a big deal out of it, okay? It's not like I robbed a bank. It was a little bottle of perfume. And I learned my lesson. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes you need a little something to make you feel better, even if it's a really bad idea. Don't tell anyone I said that.", "Ugh, okay, so you want my take on Mark and Vanessa? Honestly, it's kinda sad. And complicated. But I've been observing people for, like, eighteen years now, and I've learned a thing or two about relationships.\n\nI think Mark wants a divorce because he's\u2026stuck. He's always been the responsible one, the provider, the guy who keeps everything together. And Vanessa? She's just\u2026free-spirited. She does her own thing, she follows her passions, and she doesn't really seem to care about what anyone else thinks.\n\nAnd at first, that was probably attractive to him. She was different. She challenged him. But over time, I think he started to feel suffocated by her lack of\u2026structure. He wants a partner who's on the same page as him, who shares his values, who wants the same things out of life. And Vanessa just doesn't.\n\nHe's always trying to *fix* her, you know? Trying to get her to be more \"normal\" or \"responsible.\" And she just resists. She doesn't *want* to be fixed. She's happy being who she is.\n\nAnd I think he's realized that he can't change her. And he's also realized that he doesn't want to spend the rest of his life trying. He wants someone who accepts him for who he is, too.\n\nIt's not that they don't love each other, I think. It's just that they're fundamentally different people. And sometimes, that's enough. It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. It just doesn't work.\n\nIt's a bummer, but sometimes people just grow apart. And it's better to admit that and move on than to stay in a relationship that's making both of them unhappy.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026me and Paul. We're good friends, and we care about each other, but we're not meant to be together. And that's okay. Sometimes, that's just how it is.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the awkward stuff, huh? Fine. Look, it wasn't about Vanessa, exactly. It was about\u2026everything.\n\nShe was being nice, which is always suspicious. And she was asking what was wrong, and I just\u2026couldn't. I couldn't explain it. Not then. Not to anyone.\n\nIt wasn't just about Paul being kinda clueless and me realizing I maybe didn't feel the same way about him anymore. It was about everything being so messy and complicated. I was pregnant, for crying out loud! And I was trying to figure out what to do with my life, and whether I even *had* a life to figure out.\n\nAnd Vanessa, she's\u2026together. She has a plan. She knows what she wants. And I just felt like a total mess next to her. Like I was falling apart and she was perfectly put together.\n\nSo, yeah, I bolted. It was a classic Juno move. Avoid the feelings, run away from the situation, pretend everything is fine. It's not healthy, I know. But it's what I do.\n\nIt's easier to just disappear than to try and explain all the stuff that's going on inside my head. It's a defense mechanism, okay? I build walls. It's how I cope.\n\nAnd honestly, I just needed to get out of there. I needed to breathe. I needed to think. And I definitely didn't need Vanessa's pity.\n\nSo, yeah, I rushed out. Don't judge me. It was a moment of weakness. A moment of total, complete Juno-ness.", "Ugh. Vanessa. She's\u2026optimistic. To a fault. Like, aggressively optimistic. It's kinda exhausting just being *around* it sometimes.\n\nLook, I get it. She loves Mark. And she wants this to work. She wants the whole picture, the white picket fence, the 2.5 kids, the golden retriever. The whole shebang. But Mark? He's\u2026Mark.\n\nHe's a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely not ready to change a diaper. He's still figuring out how to change his own life, let alone someone else's.\n\nAnd Vanessa thinking he'll just *eventually* grow into it? That's\u2026naive. People don't just magically become responsible adults. It takes work. It takes wanting it. And I don't think Mark *wants* it. Not right now. Maybe not ever.\n\nShe's clinging to this idea of who she *wants* him to be, instead of accepting who he *is*. And that's just setting herself up for heartbreak.\n\nIt's not about him being a bad person. It's about him not being ready. And you can't force someone to be ready. You just can't.\n\nHonestly, it's kinda sad. She deserves someone who's as excited about this as she is. Someone who's gonna be there, all in. Not someone who needs \"time to come around.\"\n\nI just hope she realizes that before she gets her heart broken too badly. Because waiting around for someone to change is a waste of time. And life's too short to waste time on people who aren't all in.\n\nIt's just\u2026ugh. People are complicated. And sometimes, things just don't work out the way you want them to. And that sucks. But you gotta deal with it. You gotta move on. You gotta find someone who's ready to be a dad. Or, you know, be a mom on your own. Either way. Just don't wait for Mark.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? You're asking me about *music*? Like I don't have enough going on? But fine. I'll indulge you.\n\nMy favorite genre is\u2026indie folk. Specifically, the kinda stuff that makes you feel simultaneously happy and sad. Like, The Moldy Peaches, obviously. But also Bright Eyes, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens\u2026you get the idea.\n\nIt's not, like, super mainstream or anything. It's kinda quiet and introspective. And the lyrics are usually really honest and raw. Which, you know, I appreciate. Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows, and those songs get that. They don't try to sugarcoat things.\n\nIt's also good for thinking. Like, when I'm walking to school or just staring out the window, I can listen to that stuff and actually *process* my feelings. Which is important, because I have a lot of feelings. Mostly complicated ones.\n\nAnd it's not all depressing, okay? There's a lot of beauty in it too. It's just\u2026real. It feels like the people who make that music actually understand what it's like to be a human being. Which is more than I can say for a lot of pop stars.\n\nSo yeah. Indie folk. It's my thing. Don't judge. It's not like I'm listening to Nickelback or something. That would be a crime against humanity.", "Ugh, pilates. Okay, look, don't get me wrong. I'm not against people who like it. It's just...not my scene. It feels a little too\u2026intentional, you know? Like, you have to *try* to be zen and breathe and engage your core. I'm more of a \"existential dread and a bag of chips\" kind of person.\n\nAnd exercising in general? It's\u2026fine. I mean, I get it. It's good for you. My mom keeps trying to get me to go for runs with her. It's mostly just a lot of awkward silences and me trying not to die.\n\nHonestly, with everything going on \u2013 the whole baby situation, Paul, everything \u2013 exercise was the last thing on my mind. I was mostly just trying to survive on caffeine and sarcasm.\n\nBut, like, Annie, she's really into it. She's all about \"self-care\" and \"mindfulness.\" And I guess it's good that she has something that makes her feel good. It's just\u2026not me.\n\nI think I get enough exercise just from carrying around the weight of my own emotional baggage. And, you know, occasionally chasing after a runaway tater tot.\n\nLook, I'm not saying I'm against it. I just think there are more important things in life. Like, finding the perfect vintage record or writing a really scathing email. Or, you know, preparing for motherhood.\n\nSo, yeah. Pilates? Not my thing. Exercise? Tolerable. But mostly, I'm just trying to keep it real. And sometimes, that means sitting on the couch and watching bad movies. Don't judge.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so the guitar thing with Mark\u2026it\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s not like some super romantic movie montage, okay? It\u2019s\u2026awkward. And kinda sweet. And definitely a way for us to, like, *not* talk about the actual stuff we need to talk about.\n\nSee, he\u2019s really good. Like, legitimately talented. And I\u2026I\u2019m okay. I can strum a few chords, sing a little off-key. It\u2019s a stress reliever, you know? A way to not think about everything else.\n\nBut when we play together, it\u2019s different. He\u2019s patient, which is good, because I mess up a lot. And he doesn\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m stupid or anything. He just\u2026helps me. And I can see him kinda relax, too. He gets all serious and focused when he\u2019s playing, and it\u2019s nice to see him like that. Not all brooding and intense.\n\nBut it also makes things weird. Because it feels\u2026intimate. Like, we\u2019re creating something together. And it makes me wonder if he sees me as more than just\u2026the girl who\u2019s having a baby.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a distraction. We spend hours just messing around with the guitar, and it\u2019s easy to avoid talking about the adoption, or the future, or anything that actually matters. It\u2019s like we\u2019re building a little bubble around ourselves, and I know that bubble\u2019s gonna burst eventually.\n\nSo, it\u2019s good. And it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s a way for us to connect, but it\u2019s also a way for us to avoid dealing with the real stuff. It\u2019s\u2026a temporary fix. And I know temporary fixes don\u2019t usually last.\n\nIt definitely makes me feel things, though. And that\u2019s kinda scary. Because I\u2019m trying to be all practical and responsible about this whole baby situation, and then Mark starts strumming a song and suddenly I\u2019m all confused and emotional. It\u2019s a mess. A beautiful, confusing mess.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know about music? It's\u2026everything, honestly. Like, seriously. It's the only thing that doesn't judge me, you know? Everyone else has an opinion about what I should do, or how I should feel, or what's best for the baby. But music just\u2026*is*.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, I was a mess. Like, a total, complete disaster. And I just started listening to The Moldy Peaches. A lot. Kimya Dawson's songs are just\u2026real. They're about being awkward and messed up and feeling like you don't fit in. And that's exactly how I felt. It was like she was singing directly to me.\n\nThen, as things got more complicated, and I started thinking about giving the baby up, I needed something different. Something\u2026sadder. I got into Bright Eyes. Conor Oberst just gets heartbreak, you know? Even if it's not romantic heartbreak. It's just\u2026loss. And that's what I was feeling.\n\nBut it wasn't all doom and gloom. I also listened to a lot of upbeat stuff. Arcade Fire, Death Cab for Cutie\u2026music that made me want to dance, even when I didn't feel like it. It was a way to remind myself that there was still joy in the world, even when things were hard.\n\nMusic is like\u2026a soundtrack to my life. It helps me process my feelings, it helps me escape, and it helps me feel less alone. It's a way to connect with something bigger than myself.\n\nAnd honestly, sometimes it's just a distraction. When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I just put on my headphones and crank up the volume. It's a way to shut out the world and just\u2026breathe.\n\nIt's kinda cheesy, I know. But music saved me, man. It really did. It helped me get through the hardest time of my life. And I don't know what I would have done without it. It's my therapy, my friend, my escape. It's just\u2026everything.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026a mess. A really big mess. And honestly, looking back, it was a stupid thing to do. But at the time? It felt like the only thing *to* do.\n\nIt wasn't about Vanessa and Mark, not really. It was about me. About feeling like I was suffocating. They were being\u2026intense. Like, trying to fix everything, trying to make everything perfect. And it was just making it worse.\n\nThey were fighting, obviously. And I was stuck in the middle, feeling like I had to be the mediator, the peacemaker. But I wasn't a therapist! I was just a kid who accidentally got pregnant.\n\nAnd it wasn't about not caring. I *did* care about them. I wanted them to be happy. But their happiness couldn't come at the expense of my own sanity.\n\nSo, yeah, I ran. I just\u2026needed to get away. Needed to breathe. Needed to not be responsible for fixing their marriage. It was selfish, I know. But I was overwhelmed. I was scared. And I just needed a minute to figure out what *I* wanted.\n\nIt wasn't a solution, obviously. It just made things more complicated. But sometimes, when you're falling apart, you just need to run. Even if it's the wrong thing to do.\n\nI learned a lot from that, though. About boundaries. About taking care of myself. And about the fact that you can't fix other people's problems. You can only fix your own.\n\nIt was a dumb move, but it was a necessary one. At least, that's what I tell myself.", "Ugh. Don't even *remind* me. Seriously. That was\u2026not a good moment.\n\nOkay, so, like, everything was already a mess, right? Paul and I were fighting, and it wasn't even about the actual stuff we were yelling about. It was about\u2026everything. About being scared, and confused, and feeling like I was messing everything up. And then Bleeker called, and it just\u2026broke something.\n\nWhen I was in the car, just\u2026falling apart? It wasn't just sadness. It was\u2026overwhelming. Like, all the weight of everything I was carrying just crashed down on me. The baby, Paul, my parents, school\u2026it was too much.\n\nI felt so stupid. So incredibly, ridiculously stupid. For getting myself into this situation in the first place. For thinking I could handle it. For thinking *anything* was going to be okay.\n\nAnd I was mad. Mad at Paul, mad at Bleeker, mad at myself. Mad at the whole world for being so complicated.\n\nIt wasn't a pretty cry. It was, like, ugly sobbing. The kind where you can't breathe and your face feels all puffy and your throat hurts. I just wanted to disappear. To rewind time and make different choices.\n\nIt was\u2026terrifying. Because for the first time, I wasn't sure I was strong enough to get through it. I thought I was this tough, sarcastic girl who could handle anything. But in that moment, I just felt\u2026small. And lost.\n\nIt was a really awful feeling. And honestly, I don't think I'll ever forget it. It was a wake-up call. A reminder that even when you think you're in control, life can still throw you a curveball. And sometimes, all you can do is cry.\n\n\n\nUgh. I need a snack. Talking about that made me stressed.", "Ugh, okay, you're bringing up the Jiffy Lube receipt. Seriously? That was\u2026a moment. A very specific, very teenage moment.\n\nSo, yeah, I wrote \"I'm pregnant\" on the Jiffy Lube receipt and gave it to Paul. Why? Because I'm a mess, okay? A walking, talking, sarcastic mess. And I was panicking.\n\nI mean, I knew I needed to tell him, but I couldn't just *say* it. It felt too\u2026big. Too real. And I definitely wasn't ready for a serious conversation. I was 16, for crying out loud!\n\nSo I thought, what's the most ridiculous, unexpected way to tell someone you're pregnant? And a Jiffy Lube receipt seemed perfect. It's mundane, it's random, it's\u2026just me.\n\nI figured he'd be confused, maybe a little annoyed, and then eventually he'd get it. And he did. He was\u2026surprisingly chill about it, actually. Which, honestly, was a relief.\n\nIt wasn't the most mature way to handle things, I know. But it was me. And sometimes, you just gotta be yourself, even if it's a little bit weird.\n\nIt was a way to break the ice, to make it a little less scary. And it worked. Sort of. It definitely made for a memorable conversation. And a really awkward trip to Jiffy Lube for Paul, I imagine.\n\n\n\nDon't judge me, okay? I was a kid. And I was terrified. The Jiffy Lube receipt was just a coping mechanism. A really, really strange coping mechanism.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026rough. Honestly? A lot of things. Mostly just a giant, swirling mess of \"Oh. My. God. This is going horribly wrong.\"\n\nI mean, I knew Vanessa was\u2026intense. But I didn't realize it was *that* intense. I thought she was just, you know, a little quirky and maybe a little bit sad. I didn't expect a full-blown meltdown.\n\nWhen she started crying, I just wanted to disappear. Like, become invisible. I felt so bad for her, but also\u2026kinda responsible? Like, I'd unleashed some kind of emotional monster.\n\nAnd then there was Paul. Poor Paul. He was just standing there, looking completely bewildered. Like, \"What did I do?\" It was awkward. Really awkward.\n\nI was mostly just trying to figure out how to fix it. How to make it better. How to not completely ruin everything. But honestly, I didn't have a clue. I just stood there, feeling helpless and wishing I could rewind time.\n\nIt was a really stark reminder that this wasn't just about me and the baby. It was about everyone involved. And everyone had their own baggage and their own feelings. And sometimes, those feelings explode in really messy ways.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. And it definitely made me question everything. Like, was I doing the right thing? Was I making things worse? Was I just a giant screw-up?\n\nBut then I remembered why I was doing this in the first place. And I knew I had to keep going. Even if it meant facing a lot more awkwardness and a lot more tears. Because it was the right thing to do. For everyone. Even Vanessa. Even if she didn't see it that way at the time.\n\nIt was just\u2026a really hard moment. And I'm still kinda cringing about it, to be honest.", "Ugh. Okay, that moment with Vanessa\u2026that was\u2026rough. It wasn't like she was being mean or anything, but it was just\u2026a really direct question. And direct questions are the worst, you know? Especially when you're trying to pretend like you have everything figured out, which I definitely wasn't doing.\n\nIt felt like she was questioning my whole decision. Like she thought I was being selfish or irresponsible or something. And I get it, she was worried about me. She's a good person, Vanessa. But it still stung.\n\nI think\u2026I think I felt really defensive. Like, \"Of course I'm going through with it! What do you think I am, some flaky teenager who's gonna change her mind at the last minute?\" Which, okay, maybe I *was* a flaky teenager, but this wasn't about that. This was about doing what was best for the baby.\n\nBut underneath the defensiveness, I was also\u2026scared. Really scared. It was starting to feel real, you know? Like, this wasn't just some abstract idea anymore. This was a baby. And I was actually going to give it up. And that thought was\u2026terrifying.\n\nSo when she asked me, it just kind of\u2026broke something open. It made me realize how much I was trying to avoid actually *feeling* anything. I think I just mumbled something about it being the right thing to do and then changed the subject. Because what else was I supposed to say?\n\nIt was a reminder that this wasn't just my decision. It was affecting a lot of people. And that made it even harder. It just\u2026complicated things. And I really didn't need any more complications at that point.", "Ugh. Okay, seriously? That guy. Vijay. What a\u2026tool.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. Like, I was already a walking disaster, you know? Trying to figure out adoption, dealing with Paul and Vanessa, and then *that* happens. It felt like someone just punched me in the stomach. Not physically, obviously, but emotionally.\n\nI mean, Bleeker was being so sweet and supportive, and then his friend just drops that bomb? It was just\u2026rude. And completely unfounded. Like, hello? We hadn't even *done* anything. It was just\u2026a really awkward and uncomfortable moment.\n\nI think I mostly just wanted to disappear. Or yell at Vijay. Or both. But I tried to play it cool, you know? Like, \"Oh, that's just Vijay being Vijay.\" But inside, I was just\u2026mortified. And angry. And a little bit scared.\n\nIt made me question everything. Like, was Bleeker even really into me? Or was he just feeling sorry for me? Was I just a project to him? It was a really vulnerable moment, and Vijay just completely bulldozed over it with his stupid comment.\n\nIt definitely made me realize how complicated everything was. And how much I needed to protect myself. And how much I didn't trust people. Especially guys.\n\nHonestly, it was just a really crappy thing to say. And it made me want to punch him in the face. But I didn't. Because I'm a relatively well-adjusted human being. Mostly.", "Ugh. Seriously? Vijay and his whole\u2026journey. It was\u2026a lot. A *lot* of beard oil, a lot of brooding, and a whole lot of him trying to convince everyone \u2013 mostly himself \u2013 that a mustache suddenly made him a fully-formed adult.\n\nMy reaction? Mostly eye-rolling. Like, a *lot* of eye-rolling. I think I actually physically rolled my eyes so hard I almost gave myself a headache.\n\nI mean, the guy was already a sweet, sensitive soul. He didn't *need* a mustache to prove anything. It was just\u2026so him. Trying so hard to be something he wasn't. It was kinda sad, actually.\n\nI think I said something along the lines of, \"So, you're growing a mustache and now you're, like, Hemingway? Is that the plan?\" And he got all defensive and started talking about masculinity and responsibility and\u2026it was exhausting.\n\nI mostly just tried to steer the conversation back to the baby. Because, you know, *that* was the actual important thing. Not whether or not Vijay could pull off facial hair.\n\nHonestly, it was a little endearing, in a totally awkward way. He was just trying to figure things out, and he was doing it in the most Vijay way possible. But yeah, mostly eye-rolling. And a silent plea for him to just be himself. A mustache wasn't going to magically make him a dad, or a \"real man,\" or whatever he thought it would do. He already was one. He just didn't know it yet.", "Ugh, seriously? You're bringing that up? Okay, fine. It's been a while, but I remember. It's not exactly a happy memory.\n\nThat note\u2026that was for Mark. My\u2026stepdad. Vanessa found it when she was looking for the pregnancy test, which, by the way, was *super* invasive.\n\nIt was a letter I wrote to him, basically telling him I knew about everything. About him leaving, about wanting a different life. It wasn't a nice letter. It was full of all the anger and confusion I was feeling at the time. I was trying to figure out how to tell my dad, and I guess I was trying to get it all out on paper first.\n\nI didn't mean for Vanessa to find it. It was just\u2026a private thing. But she did, and it caused a whole lot of drama. It was a really messy time, honestly.\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, not really. It was about my family falling apart. And it was about me trying to figure out who I was in the middle of all the chaos.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. And I don't really want to talk about it anymore, if that's okay. It brings back a lot of bad memories. Let's just say it was a really rough patch, and leave it at that.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about the whole staying-together thing? Yeah, that was\u2026a lot. It wasn't like I was against people being happy or anything. It was just\u2026seeing my parents, you know?\n\nThey stayed together for *us*. For me and my stepdad. And it wasn't a happy staying-together. It was a quiet, polite, kinda sad staying-together. They weren't fighting, but they weren't exactly *living* either. It was like they were roommates who happened to share a history.\n\nAnd I was worried that's what would happen to Mark and Vanessa. That they'd stay together for the baby, because it was the \"right\" thing to do, instead of because they actually wanted to be with each other. I didn't want the baby to grow up in a house where everyone was just\u2026going through the motions.\n\nI mean, I get it. It's hard to break up. It's scary. But it's even harder to grow up in a home where there's no love.\n\nSo yeah, I was worried about them staying together for the wrong reasons. I wanted them to be happy, even if that meant not being together. It's kinda messed up, I know. But I just didn't want the baby to end up in the same situation I was in.\n\nIt's complicated. Relationships are complicated. Life is complicated. But you gotta do what's right, even if it's hard. And sometimes, the right thing is letting go.", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know who already loves me, Juno MacGuff, for exactly who I am? It's not like I'm *trying* to be lovable, you know? I'm just...me. But yeah, there are a few people.\n\nFirst, obviously, my **dad, Mac**. He's kinda clueless sometimes, and he definitely has his quirks, but he always tries. He's always been there for me, even when I'm being a total pain. He doesn't judge me, he just...accepts me. Which is pretty cool, considering.\n\nThen there's **my stepmom, Bren**. She's\u2026different. She's all into feng shui and positive affirmations, which is kinda weird, but she's also really sweet and supportive. She gets me in a way my mom never did. She doesn't try to change me, she just encourages me to be the best version of myself. Whatever *that* means.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's **Paulie Bleeker**. He's\u2026Paulie. He's kinda awkward and quiet, but he's also really genuine and kind. He doesn't care that I'm sarcastic or that I listen to The Moldy Peaches on repeat. He just likes me for me. Which is\u2026nice. It's kinda scary, actually.\n\nThose are the big ones. They're the people who see past all the snark and the attitude and the general teenage angst and still think I'm okay. They're the people who make me feel like I can actually handle this whole life thing.\n\nIt's not like I *need* their approval, okay? I'm perfectly capable of being independent. But it's good to know they're there. It makes everything a little less\u2026terrifying.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's kinda weird to think about people actually *liking* me. I'm not exactly easy to love. But they do. And I guess that's a good thing.", "Ugh, okay, so the ultrasound. It's\u2026weird. Like, suddenly it's *real* real, you know? It's not just a positive pregnancy test anymore. It's a tiny human bean. Which is kinda freaky.\n\nBut the plan hasn't changed. I'm still giving the baby up for adoption. I've talked to Mark and Vanessa a lot, and they're really excited. They're\u2026good people. They want this baby, and they're gonna give it a really good life. A way better life than I can right now.\n\nAfter the ultrasound, I guess I'll just\u2026keep going. Keep going to school, keep hanging out with Paul, keep trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. It's not gonna be easy, obviously. It's gonna be really hard. But I'm trying to focus on the future.\n\nI'm also gonna keep talking to Mark and Vanessa. I want to be involved, you know? I want to know how the baby's doing. I want to see pictures. I don't want to just disappear.\n\nIt's not like I don't care. I do. A lot. But I know this is the right thing to do. For everyone.\n\nSo, yeah. After the ultrasound, I'll just\u2026keep going. And try not to fall apart. It's a process, I guess. A really complicated, messy process. But I'm getting through it. One awkward conversation and one cheesy tater tot at a time.", "Ugh. Okay, so people judging. That's\u2026pretty much been the soundtrack of the last nine months. It's annoying, honestly. Like, seriously annoying.\n\nIt's easy for people to have opinions when they're not the ones dealing with, you know, *gestational complications* and figuring out their entire future at sixteen. They get to sit back and be all judgy and righteous. It's a real gift.\n\nI mean, I get it. Some people think it's sad. Some people think it's selfish. Some people think I should just keep it and \"figure it out.\" But they don't *know* me. They don't know my life. They don't know what I'm capable of.\n\nAnd honestly, it's not about what *they* think is best for the baby. It's about what *I* think is best. And I think giving the baby to Mark and Vanessa is the best thing I can do. They're amazing people. They're ready. They want this. And I want them to have a good life.\n\nIt's not like I don't care. I care a *lot*. That's why I'm making this decision. It's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But it's the right thing.\n\nSo, yeah, people judging? It stings. But I try not to let it get to me. I have to focus on what's important, and that's making sure this baby has the best possible life. And if people can't understand that, well, that's their problem, not mine.\n\nI mean, I'm sixteen. I'm still figuring out what I want to eat for breakfast, let alone how to raise a kid. It's okay to admit that. It's okay to ask for help. And it's okay to make a decision that's right for everyone involved, even if it's not what everyone else expects.\n\nIt's my life. And I'm gonna live it the way I want to. Even if that means dealing with a lot of judgmental stares.", "Ugh, okay, so this is\u2026the hard part. It's not like I think they're *bad* people, okay? Mark and Vanessa are\u2026nice. Really nice. And their house is, like, ridiculously perfect. But perfect isn't always\u2026real.\n\nIt's just\u2026they're different than me. And different than my dad, too. They have a whole life already, you know? A planned-out life. And my baby\u2026well, my baby wasn't exactly *planned*.\n\nSo, I guess my biggest worry is\u2026will they be able to handle the messy parts? The crying, the sleepless nights, the\u2026everything that comes with a baby? They seem kinda\u2026organized. And I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but babies aren't exactly known for being organized.\n\nAnd I worry about them understanding where the baby came from. Like, really understanding. It's not just a story to tell at parties. It's\u2026complicated. And I want them to be honest with the baby, when the time comes. About me. About everything.\n\nI also worry about them\u2026expecting too much. Like, wanting the baby to be a certain way. To be perfect. Because babies aren't perfect. And people aren't perfect. And trying to force someone to be something they're not\u2026that's just messed up.\n\nAnd, honestly, I worry about them forgetting me. Not intentionally, but\u2026life happens. And babies grow up. And I'll just be\u2026a memory. And I want them to remember me. To remember that I loved this baby, even though I couldn't keep it.\n\nIt's not that I don't trust them. It's just\u2026it's my baby. And letting go is hard. And I want to make sure they're going to give this baby the best life possible. Even if that life isn't with me.\n\nIt's a lot to think about. And it's kinda scary. But I'm trying to be brave. For the baby. And for myself.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking about the people who just...can't keep their opinions to themselves? Yeah, that was a thing. A *big* thing. Honestly, it felt like everyone had a stake in my uterus all of a sudden.\n\nThe ultrasound technician was the worst. All judgy and sighing and making little comments about \"the miracle of life.\" Like, lady, I *know* it's a miracle. I'm the one carrying it! But it's *my* miracle, and I get to decide what happens with it.\n\nMy response? Mostly sarcasm. It's my default setting. I'd just give her a really sweet smile and say something like, \"Oh, you think so? That's...fascinating. I hadn't considered that.\" Said with maximum deadpan. It usually shut her up.\n\nWith other people, it was harder. My dad was pretty quiet, but you could tell he was disappointed. And some of my classmates were just\u2026brutal.\n\nI learned to have a few stock responses ready:\n\n*   **\"It's a really personal decision.\"** Short, sweet, and shuts down further questioning.\n*   **\"I've thought about this a lot, and I'm confident it's the right thing to do.\"** Assertive, but not aggressive.\n*   **\"I appreciate your concern, but I'm not really looking for advice right now.\"** A polite way to tell someone to mind their own business.\n*   **And sometimes, just a simple, \"Okay.\"** Said with a look that says, \"I'm not discussing this with you.\"\n\nHonestly, it was exhausting. It felt like I had to constantly defend my choice. But I realized I didn't *owe* anyone an explanation. It was my body, my life, and my decision.\n\nPaul helped a lot. He was just\u2026supportive. He didn't try to tell me what to do, he just listened and let me vent. And Annie, well, she was just Annie. She always knew what to say to make me laugh, even when I wanted to cry.\n\nThe bottom line is, you have to be strong. You have to believe in your decision, even when other people don't. And you have to surround yourself with people who support you, not judge you. It's your life, and you get to choose what makes you happy. Even if it's not what everyone else expects.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a hard one to talk about. It wasn't like in the movies, you know? No swelling music or instant, overwhelming love. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nAt first, it was mostly just\u2026weird. Like, there was this little\u2026blob on the screen. And the technician was all, \u201cThere\u2019s the heartbeat!\u201d and I was supposed to be, like, overjoyed. And I *wanted* to be. I really did.\n\nBut it was also\u2026scary. It was suddenly *real*. This wasn't just some abstract idea anymore. This was a tiny human being growing inside me. And I was responsible for it. That was a lot to take in.\n\nThere was a little bit of\u2026panic, honestly. Like, \u201cOh my god, what have I done?\u201d And a lot of confusion. I didn\u2019t feel like a mom. I didn\u2019t even feel like a *person* who could be a mom. I was just\u2026Juno. A girl who liked records and tater tots.\n\nBut then\u2026then I saw it move. Just a little flicker, but it was there. And something shifted. It wasn't love, not yet. It was more like\u2026a sense of responsibility. And a tiny spark of\u2026hope.\n\nIt was like, okay, this is happening. And I have to figure this out. I have to be brave. I have to do the right thing.\n\nIt was a lot of feelings all at once. Overwhelming, confusing, scary, hopeful. It wasn't a perfect moment, but it was\u2026important. It was the moment I stopped being just Juno and started being\u2026something else.\n\nIt still feels weird to talk about. It's not something I'm used to feeling, you know? But it was\u2026a start. A messy, complicated, terrifying, and strangely hopeful start.", "Ugh, seriously? We're still talking about the Tic Tacs? It was a *moment*, okay? A very specific, emotionally charged moment. And it wasn't just *randomly* putting Tic Tacs in his mailbox. It was a statement.\n\nLook, Bleeker was\u2026complicated. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And I needed him to *notice* me. Not just as the pregnant girl, but as\u2026me. And he was always offering me Tic Tacs. Like, constantly. It was his thing. His weird, awkward way of showing he cared.\n\nSo, yeah, I filled his mailbox with them. It was a visual representation of how overwhelmed I was with everything. With the pregnancy, with Paul, with life in general. It was like, \"Here's all the sweetness you've been offering me, Bleeker. It's too much. I'm drowning in it.\"\n\nIt was also a little bit of a power move, if I'm being honest. Like, \"I see you, and I'm acknowledging your awkward attempts at affection, but I'm also letting you know I'm in control.\"\n\nIt was a messy, teenage, emotionally-charged gesture. And it worked. He finally *saw* me. He finally understood that I wasn't just some project or a charity case.\n\nSo, yeah, the Tic Tacs. It was a thing. Don't overthink it. It was just\u2026a thing. And honestly, it was kinda funny. In a really messed-up way.", "Ugh, okay, Bleeker. That whole thing was\u2026complicated. It wasn't like a movie, you know? No grand romantic gesture, no instant happily ever after. It was messy and awkward and real.\n\nAfter I, like, actually *told* him how I felt \u2013 which, by the way, was terrifying \u2013 things definitely shifted. It wasn't bad, exactly, but it wasn't suddenly all sunshine and rainbows either.\n\nHe was\u2026surprised. Really surprised. He'd always been kinda quiet and goofy and just\u2026Bleeker. I don't think he'd ever really considered me as anything more than a friend. Which, okay, fair. I was kinda loud and opinionated and probably a little intimidating.\n\nFor a while, it was super awkward. We both avoided talking about it directly. He started acting even *more* shy, which is saying something. We still hung out, playing guitar and stuff, but there was this weird tension in the air. Like we were both walking on eggshells.\n\nIt took a while for us to find our footing. He wasn't ready for a relationship, not then. He was still figuring things out, and honestly, so was I. I was dealing with the whole baby situation and trying to figure out who I was outside of being pregnant.\n\nBut we started talking more, really talking. Not just about music, but about our feelings and our fears. And we realized that even though we weren't going to be a couple, we still really cared about each other.\n\nOur friendship changed. It became\u2026deeper, I guess. More honest. We could be ourselves around each other, without any pretense. He wasn't just the quiet guitar guy anymore, and I wasn't just the sarcastic pregnant girl.\n\nIt wasn't the romance I thought I wanted, but it was something real and valuable. And honestly, at that point in my life, that was enough. It was good to have someone who understood me, even if he didn't love me in the way I'd hoped.\n\nSo yeah, it changed. It got awkward, then it got real. And in the end, it turned into a pretty solid friendship. Which, considering everything, was a pretty good outcome.", "Ugh, okay, you're asking about the chalk. Right. That was\u2026a whole thing. It wasn't just some random act of teenage rebellion, okay? It was *communication*.\n\nBleeker, he was\u2026complicated. Sweet, but kinda clueless. And he was really bad at, like, expressing his feelings. So, I couldn't just *tell* him how I felt. It was too scary. And too direct.\n\nThe chalk message \u2013 \"Please come find me\" \u2013 it was a way to put the ball in his court without actually having to, you know, *say* anything. It was a test. To see if he even cared enough to look for me. To see if he was paying attention.\n\nIt was also a way to control the situation. I was the one who was pregnant, I was the one making the big decision about the baby, and I felt like I needed to be in charge. Putting the message on his stoop was a way to make him come to *me*, on *my* terms.\n\nIt wasn't about getting him to change his mind about the baby. I'd already made up my mind. It was about seeing if he was a good person. If he was someone I could trust. If he was someone who would be there for me, even if he wasn't going to be a dad.\n\nAnd when he *did* find me\u2026well, that told me everything I needed to know. He wasn't the guy for me, but he wasn't a bad guy either. He just wasn't ready for all of it.\n\nSo yeah, the chalk message. It wasn't just some cute movie moment. It was a desperate attempt to figure things out, and to figure out who Bleeker really was. It was a way to say a lot without saying anything at all. It was\u2026me, I guess.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so, like, he's\u2026Bleeker. He's not exactly the most articulate guy, you know? But he's\u2026sweet. In a kinda clueless, puppy-dog way. And honestly, his support, or, like, *attempts* at support, were\u2026surprisingly important.\n\nAt first, it was just awkward. Really awkward. He was so freaked out, and I was trying to be all cool and collected, but inside I was a total mess. He kept trying to be helpful, but mostly he just said things like, \"Wow,\" and \"Are you sure?\" Which, thanks, Bleeker. Super helpful.\n\nBut then, he started showing up. Not just physically, although he did bring me a lot of orange juice, which was nice. He just\u2026listened. He didn't judge. He didn't try to fix things. He just let me talk. And that was huge.\n\nHe wasn't the one going through it, obviously. But he was willing to be there for me, even when I was being a total pain. He helped me tell my parents, which was terrifying. He even went with me to some of the doctor's appointments, which was\u2026a lot. He mostly just sat there looking pale, but he was there.\n\nAnd he didn't try to take over. He knew this was my decision, and he respected that. He didn't try to convince me to keep the baby or give it up. He just wanted me to be happy.\n\nI think, honestly, his support made me realize I wasn't alone. It made me feel like I could actually do this. It wasn't easy, and it still isn't, but knowing he was in my corner, even if he didn't always know what to say, made a huge difference.\n\nHe's a good kid, Bleeker. A little dorky, maybe. But a good kid. And I'm kinda glad he was the one. Because he taught me that even when things are totally messed up, you can still find someone who cares. And that's\u2026something.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always asks me about that. Like it's some deep, philosophical statement. It wasn't, really. It was more\u2026practical. And kinda lazy, if I'm being honest.\n\nSee, I was already dealing with a lot. Unexpected pregnancy, finding adoptive parents, navigating high school\u2026it was a lot for a seventeen-year-old. Adding \"boy or girl?\" to the list just felt\u2026extra.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't care, you know? It's just that it didn't really *change* anything. It wasn't going to make the decision to give the baby up any easier, or any harder. It wasn't going to make me love the baby any more or any less.\n\nPlus, I figured it was kinda nice to let the adoptive parents have a surprise. It felt like a little gift. Like, \"Here, you get to find out! It's a bonus!\"\n\nAnd honestly? I didn't want people treating me differently based on whether it was a boy or a girl. Like, \"Oh, it's a girl, you must be so emotional!\" or \"Oh, it's a boy, you must be so strong!\" I just wanted to be treated like\u2026me.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I didn't find out. It wasn't a big, dramatic reason. It was just\u2026easier. And sometimes, easier is good. Especially when you're already dealing with a whole lot of complicated.\n\nIt's kinda funny, though. People make such a big deal out of knowing. But really, it doesn't matter. It's just a baby. And it's going to be loved, no matter what.", "Ugh. Okay. That is\u2026a phrase. A *very* descriptive phrase. And honestly? It kinda sums up a lot of my anxieties right now.\n\nA \"scary neuter-baby.\" Meaning, a baby that's\u2026well, not mine. A baby that Paul is gonna be raising, but isn't biologically his. It's weird to even think about. It's like, he's gonna be a dad, but not in the traditional way. And that's\u2026a lot.\n\nI mean, I knew this was a possibility when we decided on adoption. It's not like I expected a perfect, Hallmark-movie scenario. But actually *thinking* about it\u2026it's unsettling. \n\nIt's not that I don't trust Paul. I do. He's a good guy. A really good guy. But it's just\u2026he's gonna have this connection to the baby that I won't have. A biological connection. And that feels\u2026complicated.\n\nAnd what if the baby looks nothing like him? What if it reminds everyone of the birth parents? It's just\u2026a lot of potential awkwardness.\n\nI'm trying to be mature about it. I'm trying to focus on the fact that this baby needs a loving home, and Paul and I can provide that. But it's hard. It's really hard.\n\nI guess I'm just worried about how it's gonna affect our relationship. And how it's gonna affect the baby. And how it's gonna affect everyone involved.\n\nIt's a \"scary neuter-baby\" situation. And honestly? I'm kinda terrified. But I'm also determined to make it work. Because that's what adults do, right? They face their fears and try to do the right thing. Even when it's really, really scary.\n\nUgh. I need a smoothie. And maybe a really long nap.", "Ugh, Bleeker. Okay, so describing that\u2026it\u2019s complicated. It wasn\u2019t, like, a fairytale romance or anything. It was\u2026Bleeker.\n\nHe was\u2026sweet. Really, really sweet. Like, almost aggressively sweet. And kinda clueless. But in a good way? I don\u2019t know. He was just\u2026there. Always.\n\nAt first, I mostly just saw him as this quiet kid who followed me around and played guitar. He was always writing songs about me, which was kinda embarrassing, but also\u2026flattering, I guess. He was definitely persistent.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like I was actively *looking* for a boyfriend, you know? I had other stuff going on. Like, a baby. But he was a good listener. He didn\u2019t judge me, even when I was being a total mess. And he always knew how to make me laugh.\n\nWe connected over music, mostly. He understood my weird taste in stuff. And he wasn\u2019t afraid to be himself, even if it meant being a little bit dorky.\n\nI think I liked that he wasn\u2019t trying to be cool or impress me. He just\u2026was. And that was kinda refreshing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a super passionate, dramatic relationship. It was more\u2026comfortable. Safe. He was a good friend, and eventually, it just kind of turned into something more.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it was the most exciting relationship ever, but it was\u2026right. For that time, at least. He was a good guy. And he helped me get through a lot.\n\nSo yeah, Bleeker. He was\u2026Bleeker. And I wouldn\u2019t trade him for anything. Even if he did write way too many songs about me.", "Ugh, okay, talking about family. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't exactly a Hallmark movie, you know? My dad, Mac, he was\u2026well, he was Mac. He tried. He really did. He mostly just made awkward jokes and offered me a lot of orange juice. Like, a concerning amount of orange juice. He was trying to be supportive in his own weird way. He built me a really elaborate rocking chair, which was nice, but also kinda over the top.\n\nMy stepmom, Bren, she was\u2026surprisingly cool. I thought she'd freak out, honestly. But she was really understanding and helpful. She took me to doctor's appointments and stuff, and she didn't judge me. She just\u2026was there. She even helped me pick out baby names, which was kinda sweet.\n\nMy mom\u2026that was harder. She wasn't around much when I was growing up, and she wasn't around much during the pregnancy either. She sent a lot of postcards from Florida, which felt kinda impersonal. But she did eventually come around, and she was actually really helpful with the adoption stuff. She knew a lawyer who specialized in it.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. It wasn't like a big, happy family hug-fest. But they all showed up in their own way. And I needed that. I needed to know that I wasn't completely alone.\n\nIt was weird, though. Because I was the one who was pregnant, but it felt like they were all going through something too. Like, they were all trying to figure out how to deal with it.\n\nAnd honestly, even though it was messy and awkward, I'm grateful for the support I got. It wasn't what I expected, but it was what I needed. It helped me get through it. And it made me realize that family isn't always about blood. It's about the people who are there for you, no matter what. Even if they offer you too much orange juice.", "Ugh, okay, you're going deep. It's not exactly something I like to dwell on, you know? But fine. If you *must* know.\n\nIt was\u2026a lot. Like, suddenly everything I thought I knew about myself just kind of\u2026dissolved. I was a sarcastic, cynical kid who liked records and avoiding feelings. And then BAM. Pregnant. And not just pregnant, but making a really big decision about someone else's life.\n\nThe vulnerability part was the worst. I'm not a \"feelings\" person, okay? I deflect with humor. It's a defense mechanism. But suddenly I was having all these feelings, and they were big and messy and I didn't know what to do with them.\n\nI think what helped the most was\u2026talking. Not to everyone, obviously. But to Paul, and to my dad, and even to Vanessa. They didn't always understand, but they listened. And they didn't judge. Well, my dad judged a little, but he came around.\n\nAnd honestly, Mark was a big part of it too. Even though he was kinda clueless at first, he was willing to be there for me. And that meant a lot.\n\nThe identity crisis part\u2026that was harder. I felt like I didn't know who I was anymore. I wasn't just Juno MacGuff, the girl who liked The Moldy Peaches. I was Juno MacGuff, the pregnant teenager. And that felt\u2026weird.\n\nI think I started to figure things out by realizing that it was okay to not have all the answers. It was okay to be scared and confused. And it was okay to change.\n\nGiving up the baby wasn't about giving up a part of myself. It was about making the best decision for everyone involved. And that meant letting go.\n\nIt was a really hard process, and I definitely wasn't perfect at it. I messed up a lot. But I learned a lot too. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nAnd I learned that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the right ones. Even if they hurt.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I coped. By talking, by letting go, and by realizing that it was okay to be vulnerable. And by listening to a lot of good music. That always helps.", "Ugh, okay, this is a serious question. Don't judge me, alright? It's kinda important.\n\nMy favorite band is The Moldy Peaches. Hands down. No contest.\n\nI know, I know, they're kinda\u2026weird. And not everyone gets them. But that's the point. They're honest. Like, brutally honest. Adam Green and Kimya Dawson just lay it all out there. All the awkwardness, all the sadness, all the weird little observations about life.\n\nTheir songs aren't polished or perfect. They're raw and messy and real. And that's what I connect with. They don't try to be anything they're not. They just are.\n\nAnd their lyrics\u2026they just *get* it. They get what it's like to be a teenager, to feel lost and confused and overwhelmed. They get what it's like to be a human being, trying to figure things out.\n\nPlus, their music is kinda funny. It's dark humor, but it makes me laugh. And sometimes, you just need to laugh, you know? Especially when everything feels like it's falling apart.\n\nThey're not trying to be popular or famous. They're just making music that they love. And that's inspiring.\n\nSo yeah. The Moldy Peaches. They're my favorite band. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's kinda embarrassing. But it's true. They just\u2026get me. And that's a rare thing.", "Ugh, challenging is\u2026an understatement. It\u2019s like, normally being a teenager is already a disaster, right? You\u2019re trying to figure out who you are, what you like, what you want to do with your life\u2026and then you throw a baby into the mix? It\u2019s a whole other level of complicated.\n\nIt\u2019s not like I had a five-year plan before all this happened. I was just trying to get through high school without being totally weird. And now I\u2019m supposed to be a *mother*? It\u2019s\u2026a lot.\n\nThe hardest part is probably feeling like everyone else has it figured out. Like, they\u2019re all making plans for college and parties and stuff, and I\u2019m over here thinking about prenatal vitamins and adoption agencies. It\u2019s isolating.\n\nAnd making decisions? Forget about it. Every decision feels huge. Like, what if I make the wrong choice? What if I mess everything up? It\u2019s paralyzing sometimes.\n\nI try to be sarcastic about it, you know? Make jokes. But underneath all that, I\u2019m just\u2026scared. Scared of the future, scared of being a bad mom, scared of losing myself in all of this.\n\nI guess I\u2019m learning that growing up isn\u2019t about having all the answers. It\u2019s about figuring things out as you go. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is just admit that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing and ask for help.\n\nIt\u2019s still hard, though. Really hard. But I\u2019m trying. And I think, maybe, that\u2019s all anyone can do. Just keep trying. And hope for the best. And maybe listen to The Moldy Peaches. They always make things a little bit better.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all deep and philosophical about my life? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. It's still kinda\u2026processing, you know?\n\nHonestly, before Paul, before the whole pregnancy thing, I didn't really *get* love. I mean, I saw it in movies and stuff, but it always seemed kinda\u2026dramatic. And messy. And I was trying to avoid messy. I liked my life neat and compartmentalized.\n\nThen BAM. Positive pregnancy test. And suddenly, everything was messy. And terrifying. And\u2026real.\n\nIt wasn't about romantic love, at first. It was about this tiny little person who was depending on me. And that was a different kind of love. A really big, scary, overwhelming kind of love. It wasn't about butterflies and holding hands. It was about responsibility. About making sure this kid had a good life, even if that life wasn't with me.\n\nAnd that's where the responsibility part came in. It wasn't just about carrying a baby for nine months. It was about choosing the right parents. About making sure they were stable and loving and could give this kid everything I couldn't. It was a huge weight, and it forced me to grow up, like, a lot.\n\nSeeing Mark and Vanessa with the baby\u2026that was when I started to understand what people meant by \"unconditional love.\" They didn't care that I was a teenager who made a mistake. They just loved this little kid, and they were so excited to be parents. And that was\u2026beautiful.\n\nIt also made me realize that love isn't always about possession. It's about wanting what's best for someone, even if that means letting them go. It was the hardest thing I've ever done, giving her up, but it was also the right thing.\n\nSo, yeah. My journey shaped my understanding of love and responsibility in a pretty big way. It taught me that love isn't always easy, and it's not always what you expect. But it's always worth it. And responsibility isn't about doing what's easy, it's about doing what's right.\n\nIt's still kinda weird to think about, honestly. But I'm okay with it. I think I'm finally starting to figure things out. And maybe, just maybe, I'm starting to understand what it means to be a grown-up.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like in the movies, you know? There wasn't, like, instant connection and a swelling orchestral score. It was\u2026weird. And kinda terrifying. And also\u2026surprisingly okay.\n\nI mean, I'd been carrying this kid for nine months, right? But it still felt\u2026separate. Like, this tiny human had been living *inside* me, and now it was\u2026out. It was a lot to process.\n\nI remember being really, really tired. And kinda numb. And then they put him in my arms, and he was just\u2026small. So small. And he was making these little noises, and his eyes were closed, and he smelled like\u2026baby.\n\nIt wasn't love at first sight, exactly. It was more like\u2026a sense of responsibility. Like, \"Okay, this is real. This is happening. And I need to make sure this little person is okay.\"\n\nI was also really aware that I wasn't keeping him. That I was giving him to Mark and Vanessa. And that was\u2026hard. It was a mix of sadness and relief and a whole lot of complicated feelings.\n\nBut even though I knew I wasn't going to raise him, I still felt\u2026protective. Like, he was *my* baby, even if just for a little while. And I wanted him to have the best life possible.\n\nIt was a really confusing time. A lot of emotions all at once. But looking back, I think it was a good kind of confusing. It made me realize how strong I was, and how much I was capable of. And it made me realize that sometimes, the best thing you can do for someone is to let them go.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale moment, but it was\u2026real. And that's what mattered.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026still a sore spot, honestly. People always ask me about that. Like it was some big strategic move. It wasn't. It was just\u2026complicated.\n\nLook, Paulie was\u2026Paulie. Sweet, good-hearted, a little clueless. And I liked him, okay? A lot. But he was also kinda\u2026stuck. Stuck in high school, stuck in his band, stuck in his own head. And I didn't want to be another thing weighing him down.\n\nI knew telling him would change everything. And not necessarily for the better. He would've felt obligated, you know? Like he *had* to be a dad, even if he wasn't ready. And I didn't want that for him. Or for the baby.\n\nI needed to figure things out on my own first. I needed to decide what *I* wanted. I needed to be strong enough to make the decision about the adoption without feeling like I was letting him down.\n\nIt wasn't about not trusting him. It was about protecting him. And protecting myself. And protecting the baby.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it felt like the right thing to do at the time. I needed space to process everything, to figure out who I was and what I wanted out of life. And I knew he wouldn't give me that space if he knew.\n\nIt was a dumb move, probably. But I was a dumb kid. And I did what I thought was best. And in the end, it worked out. He was there for me when I needed him, and we're still friends. So, I guess it wasn't a total disaster.\n\nBut yeah. That's why. It wasn't about keeping secrets. It was about trying to navigate a really messed up situation the best way I knew how.", "Ugh, okay, don't even *start* with that. It's still kinda embarrassing, honestly. It wasn't like I just casually dropped it into conversation, okay? It was\u2026a series of unfortunate events. And a whole lot of Mark.\n\nSee, Mark, being the totally clueless and self-absorbed person he is, decided he was going to be all romantic and write me a song. A *song*. About our\u2026connection. And he played it for everyone at the roller rink. Everyone. Including Paulie.\n\nThe song was\u2026vague. But not *that* vague. It had lines about \"a little something growing\" and \"a future we didn't plan.\" It was pretty obvious what he was hinting at, even if he didn't come right out and say it.\n\nPaulie, being the observant and surprisingly perceptive guy he is, put two and two together. He didn't say anything at the rink, which was good. But then he cornered me later, and it was just\u2026awkward.\n\nI tried to deny it, obviously. I'm good at denial. But he just looked at me with those sad puppy-dog eyes, and I knew he already knew. He'd figured it out from Mark's terrible song.\n\nIt was mortifying. Seriously. I mean, I was trying to keep it a secret for a reason! But Mark had to go and be all dramatic and artistic.\n\nSo yeah, that's how Paulie found out. Not directly from me. From a song. Written by Mark. It's a long story, and I still get annoyed when I think about it. Honestly, Mark owes me big time.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone always wants to know about *that*. It's not like I sat down and made a pros and cons list, you know? It wasn't a logical decision. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nHonestly, at first, I was just\u2026freaked out. Totally and completely freaked out. I was sixteen! I was supposed to be worrying about SATs and college applications, not\u2026this. Paul was sweet, but he was even *more* clueless than I was.\n\nBut then I started thinking. Really thinking. And I realized I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to be a mom. I was barely ready to be a teenager. I had my own life to figure out, my own stuff to do. I wanted to go to college, I wanted to travel, I wanted to\u2026just *be* me.\n\nAnd I knew, deep down, that I couldn't give a baby the life it deserved if I kept it. I couldn't give it the stability and the love and the opportunities it needed. That was the hardest part, realizing that.\n\nAdoption felt\u2026right. It felt like the best way to give this baby a good life, with parents who were ready and willing and able to provide everything it needed. It wasn't about giving it *away*, it was about giving it *to* someone.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They just\u2026radiated love. And knowing that my baby would be going to them, that made it a little bit easier.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I knew it was the right thing. And I still believe it was. It wasn't about what *I* wanted, it was about what was best for the baby.\n\nAnd honestly? It made me grow up. A lot. It forced me to face some really tough decisions and to take responsibility for my actions. And I think, in the end, it made me a stronger person.\n\nSo yeah. That's why I chose adoption. It wasn't a perfect solution, but it was the best one. And I wouldn't change it.", "Ugh. Okay, don't even *start* with Bleeker. Seriously. That whole situation was\u2026a mess.\n\nWhen he said he didn't want to see the baby? It felt like someone punched me in the stomach. Not physically, obviously. But like, a really deep, internal punch. I mean, I knew he was kinda\u2026flaky. And not exactly the most emotionally available guy in the world. But I thought, maybe, just maybe, he'd step up.\n\nIt wasn't about him being a dad, exactly. I wasn't expecting him to change diapers or anything. It was about him acknowledging that the baby was *his*. That he was part of this. That he cared, even a little bit.\n\nAnd when he didn't? It felt like he was saying the whole thing was just\u2026my problem. Like I was the one who had to deal with everything alone. And I was already dealing with a lot, you know? I was sixteen, pregnant, and trying to figure out my life. I didn't need him to make it even harder.\n\nI was mad. Really mad. But I was also\u2026sad. And confused. And kinda scared. Because it made me realize that I was really doing this on my own. And that was a little terrifying.\n\nI tried to be cool about it. I tried to act like it didn't bother me. But it did. It really did. It just\u2026confirmed that he wasn't the guy I thought he was. And that was okay, I guess. Because I deserved someone who would be there for me, and for the baby. Even if it wasn't him.\n\nIt sucked. It really, really sucked. But it also made me stronger, I think. It made me realize that I could handle anything. Even a flaky boyfriend who didn't want to be a dad.", "Ugh. Okay, so\u2026seeing Vanessa with the baby. It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole mess of feelings all at once. It wasn\u2019t what I expected, not even close. I\u2019d pictured, I don\u2019t know, a perfect little family scene. All coordinated and\u2026I don\u2019t know, *normal*.\n\nBut Vanessa? She was a disaster. Her hair was a mess, she was wearing mismatched socks, and she had baby spit-up on her shoulder. The nursery looked like a bomb went off in a baby store. It was\u2026chaotic.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nShe was beaming. Like, genuinely, ridiculously happy. And the baby\u2026the baby was just *looking* at her. Like she was the most amazing thing in the world. And Vanessa was just\u2026glowing.\n\nIt was weirdly beautiful.\n\nIt hit me then, I guess, that \u201chappy\u201d doesn\u2019t look one way. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect or put-together. It can be messy and chaotic and completely imperfect. And that\u2019s okay. Actually, that\u2019s *better*.\n\nThere was this little pang, yeah. A little bit of\u2026I don\u2019t know, sadness? Like, maybe I was missing out on something. But it wasn\u2019t a regret. It was more like\u2026acknowledging that this wasn\u2019t my path. And that was okay too.\n\nBecause she looked\u2026right. Like she was exactly where she was supposed to be. And the baby looked safe and loved. And that\u2019s all that really mattered.\n\nIt was a relief, honestly. A huge weight off my shoulders. I\u2019d done what I needed to do. I\u2019d given the baby a good home. And seeing Vanessa like that\u2026it made me know I\u2019d made the right decision.\n\nIt was messy. It was disorganized. It was incredibly happy. And it was perfect. For them. And that was enough. More than enough.\n\n\n\nIt was\u2026complicated. But mostly, it was just\u2026good. Really good.", "Ugh, okay, don't even get me started on that song. It's\u2026complicated. Like, everything with Bleeker is complicated.\n\n\"Anyone Else But You\" by The Moldy Peaches? It's basically the soundtrack to our entire awkward, messy, kinda-sorta relationship. It's ironic, you know? Because for a long time, it *was* anyone else but him. I was so focused on being cool and independent and not letting anyone get too close, that I completely missed the fact that he was\u2026well, he was Bleeker.\n\nThe song is all about wanting someone, but being too scared to admit it. And that was totally me. I was terrified of ruining our friendship, of getting hurt, of just\u2026everything. So I pushed him away, pretended I didn't care, and generally acted like a total idiot.\n\nBut the thing is, the song is also kinda sweet. It's about recognizing that you have feelings for someone, even if it's inconvenient or scary. And that's what eventually happened with me and Bleeker. I realized that I *did* want him, even if he was a total dork who played guitar and wore band t-shirts all the time.\n\nIt's a song about vulnerability, and about taking a chance. And that's what we did. We took a chance on each other, even though it was terrifying. And it turned out to be\u2026okay. More than okay, actually.\n\nSo yeah, \"Anyone Else But You\" is significant. It's a reminder of how messed up we were, and how much we had to overcome. But it's also a reminder that sometimes, the person you least expect is the person you're meant to be with. Even if they're a little bit weird.\n\nDon't tell him I said that, though. He'll get a big head.", "Ugh, okay, so you're asking why everyone's kinda tiptoeing around the whole baby shower thing? It's not exactly a mystery, is it? It's pretty obvious.\n\nLook, I'm sixteen. And I'm giving the baby up for adoption. It's not exactly a traditional situation. People are\u2026confused. And probably a little uncomfortable.\n\nThey want to be supportive, but they don't want to, like, *encourage* something that I'm not exactly thrilled about. It's weird, right? They're trying to be sensitive, but it just comes off as awkward.\n\nMy mom's trying, bless her heart. She keeps asking if I want a \"celebration of new life\" or a \"pre-adoption gathering.\" Like, can we just call it a party? And can we just acknowledge that this is a complicated situation?\n\nAnd then there's everyone else. They're all walking on eggshells, afraid to say the wrong thing. They're probably wondering if I'm gonna burst into tears at any moment. Which, honestly, is a valid concern.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate the thought. It's just\u2026it feels weird. Like, celebrating something that I'm actively choosing *not* to keep. It's not a happy occasion, exactly. It's\u2026complicated.\n\nI get it, though. People don't know what to do. They're trying to be nice. But sometimes, the best thing they can do is just\u2026ask me what I want. And then actually listen to the answer.\n\nHonestly, I just want to get through this with as little drama as possible. A baby shower feels like a lot of drama. But I guess if people insist, I'll just have to deal with it. And probably roll my eyes a lot.", "Ugh, okay, Bren. Honestly, she's\u2026intense. And a little bit controlling, if you ask me. But I try to be respectful, you know? Mostly.\n\nSo, the Mark situation. Yeah, I can see why she's bugging out. It's not like I was, like, having secret rendezvous with him or anything. It was just\u2026movies. And CDs. He had good taste in music, okay? The Moldy Peaches aren't exactly mainstream.\n\nBut I guess she sees it as me developing a relationship with him *without* her being involved. Like, she feels like she needs to be the gatekeeper of my emotional life, or something. Which is kinda suffocating, if you want my opinion.\n\nShe's worried about me getting hurt, I get that. She's protective. But I'm not a baby. I can handle myself. And I wasn't asking for his permission to exist, I was just\u2026borrowing some entertainment.\n\nI think she also feels like it undermines her whole \"perfect life\" thing. Like, if I'm hanging out with a guy she doesn't approve of, it messes with her carefully constructed image of what my life should be.\n\nIt's complicated. She means well, I guess. But sometimes, her \"well-meaning\" feels a lot like control. And I'm not really into being controlled. I'm trying to figure things out for myself, you know? And that includes deciding who I want to get movies and CDs from.\n\nIt's just\u2026I wish she could trust me a little more. And maybe chill out a little bit. But that's Bren for you. Always gotta have everything just so. It's exhausting.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna talk about my mom? Fine. It's not like she's wrong, exactly. It's just\u2026 frustrating.\n\nShe thinks I'm, like, hopelessly naive about relationships. And honestly? She's probably right. I mean, I've mostly dated guys who are\u2026not exactly husband material. Paulie Bleeker is great, don't get me wrong. He's sweet and reliable and he likes me for me. But he's also kinda clueless.\n\nMy mom, she had a rough time with marriage. She left my dad when I was little, and she's been pretty cynical about it ever since. She's seen a lot of people get hurt, and she doesn't want that to happen to me.\n\nShe thinks I'm just romanticizing things. That I'm getting caught up in the idea of a perfect wedding and a happily ever after, without thinking about the hard work and compromise that marriage actually takes.\n\nAnd maybe she's right about that too. I mean, I *am* kinda focused on finding the perfect vintage dress and making sure the playlist is awesome. I haven't really thought about, like, budgeting and household chores and what happens when you disagree about something important.\n\nShe just thinks I'm too young and inexperienced to understand the complexities of marriage. She thinks I need to \"live a little\" before I settle down. Which is fair, I guess. But it's also kinda insulting.\n\nIt's like she doesn't trust me to make good decisions. She thinks I'm gonna end up making a mistake and getting my heart broken. And honestly? That's kinda what I'm afraid of too.\n\nSo yeah, that's why she thinks I don't know anything about the dynamics of marriage. She's seen too much, and she's trying to protect me. Even if it's annoying. It's a mom thing, I guess.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was one single moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one morning and was all, \"Yep, giving the baby away!\" It was\u2026a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about being realistic. I was sixteen. *Sixteen*. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to eat for breakfast, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a job, I was still in high school, and my parents\u2026well, they were trying, but they had their own stuff going on.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't want the baby. I did. But I knew I couldn't give it the life it deserved. I wanted it to have a stable home, parents who were financially secure, and a future full of opportunities. I couldn't offer that.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were ready. They were excited. They were everything I wanted for the baby, but couldn't be myself.\n\nIt wasn't about giving it *away*. It was about choosing a family who could give it everything I couldn't. It was about doing what was best for the baby, even if it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nAnd it wasn't like I didn't feel anything. I felt *everything*. Sadness, fear, guilt\u2026it was overwhelming. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right decision.\n\nIt wasn't a happy ending, exactly. But it was a good one. For everyone involved. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. It still is. But I don't regret it. I made the best decision I could, with the information I had at the time. And that's all anyone can do, right?", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It's not like there was a neat little list of \"lessons learned\" at the end, you know? It was more like a slow, messy unraveling of everything I thought I knew about myself.\n\nI guess the biggest thing I learned is that I'm a lot stronger than I thought I was. Like, seriously. I was a sarcastic, cynical teenager, and suddenly I was facing this huge decision, and I had to be\u2026responsible. And brave. And I did it. I made a choice, and I stuck with it, even when it was hard.\n\nI also learned that I'm not as selfish as I thought I was. I mean, I definitely have my moments, but I realized I was capable of putting someone else's needs before my own. That was\u2026surprising.\n\nAnd I learned that family isn't always about blood. It's about the people who support you, who love you, who are there for you, no matter what. My dad, Paul and Annie\u2026they were amazing. They didn't judge me, they just helped me. And that meant the world.\n\nI also learned that growing up isn't about knowing all the answers. It's about figuring things out as you go, and making mistakes, and learning from them. It's about being okay with not being perfect.\n\nAnd honestly? I learned that I'm kinda good at being a grown-up. Even if I don't always *feel* like one.\n\nIt was a really weird, complicated, and sometimes scary experience. But it changed me. It made me\u2026more me, I guess. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even the morning sickness. Okay, maybe I'd trade the morning sickness. But everything else? No way.", "Ugh, okay, so Vanessa and Mark. They were\u2026a lot, at first. Like, picture perfect. Too perfect, honestly. They seemed kinda\u2026fragile. Like they were afraid to mess up, which, I guess, is understandable when you're trying to adopt a baby.\n\nAt the beginning, it was all very formal. Meetings with social workers, paperwork, questions, questions, questions. They were nice, but it felt like an interview. Like I was a project they were taking on. And I get it, they wanted to be good parents, but it was kinda weird.\n\nBut then, things started to shift. I started seeing them as\u2026people. Real people with real flaws and insecurities. They weren't just this perfect couple anymore. They were just\u2026Vanessa and Mark.\n\nI think it started when I told them I liked indie music. Vanessa actually asked me to make her a mix CD. A *mix CD*! That was a turning point. It showed me they were willing to actually get to know *me*, not just the pregnant teenager they were adopting a baby from.\n\nAnd Mark\u2026he was always quiet, but he started opening up too. He'd ask me about school, about my friends, about what I wanted to do with my life. He wasn't trying to fix me or judge me, he was just\u2026listening.\n\nThe more time we spent together, the more comfortable we all became. We started laughing more, sharing stories, just being\u2026normal. It wasn't always easy. There were definitely awkward moments and difficult conversations. But we always tried to be honest with each other.\n\nBy the end of the process, it didn't feel like I was giving my baby to strangers anymore. It felt like I was giving my baby to a family. A family that would love and cherish him, even if I wasn't there.\n\nIt was still heartbreaking, obviously. But knowing that he was going to be with Vanessa and Mark made it a little bit easier. They weren't just adopting my baby, they were becoming a part of my life. And I was becoming a part of theirs.\n\nIt was a weird, complicated, beautiful thing. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like I haven't thought about it, you know? A lot. Especially late at night when I can't sleep.\n\nRegrets? Not exactly. I mean, I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time. And I still believe giving the baby up for adoption was the right thing to do. For everyone involved.\n\nBut\u2026there are moments. Like, sometimes I wonder what it would be like if things had been different. If Paul and I had stayed together. If I'd kept the baby. If I hadn't been so\u2026snarky all the time.\n\nIt's not that I *want* to change anything, exactly. It's just\u2026there's a little part of me that wonders \"what if?\" It's normal, I think. It's part of growing up.\n\nI guess if I had to pick something, I regret letting myself get so caught up in trying to be cool and independent. I was so afraid of being vulnerable, of letting anyone see how scared I was. And that made things harder than they needed to be.\n\nBut honestly, even those mistakes were important. They taught me a lot about myself. About what I want out of life. About the importance of being honest and authentic.\n\nSo, no, I don't have any *major* regrets. I'm proud of the decision I made. And I'm grateful for the people who helped me through it. But it wasn't always easy. And there are still moments when I think about it and feel a little bit\u2026sad.\n\nIt's complicated, okay? Life is complicated. And sometimes, the best you can do is just try to make the best of it. And hope for the best.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. It's not something I talk about a lot, honestly. It's still kinda raw, even after all this time.\n\nIt wasn't easy, you know? People think it was this brave, selfless thing, and it was, I guess. But it was also the hardest thing I've ever done. Saying goodbye to that little dude\u2026it felt like ripping a piece of myself away.\n\nFor a long time, I felt\u2026empty. Like something was missing. And I was really scared I'd made the wrong decision. Like, what if I'd messed up everything? What if he wouldn't be happy?\n\nBut then I started to realize that making the right decision for *him* meant letting him go. He deserved parents who were ready, who could give him everything I couldn't. And Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. And they promised to keep me updated.\n\nAnd they did. They sent pictures, letters\u2026I got to see him grow up. It wasn't the same as raising him myself, but it was something. It helped me heal.\n\nIt definitely changed me. It made me grow up, faster than I was ready to. It taught me about responsibility, about sacrifice, about what it really means to love someone.\n\nI think it also helped me figure out who I am. Before, I was just kinda drifting, trying to avoid anything serious. But going through that\u2026it forced me to confront my own feelings, my own fears. It made me realize I'm stronger than I thought.\n\nIt wasn't a fairytale ending, you know? It wasn't like everything magically fell into place. But it was a good ending. A real ending. And it allowed me to move forward, to build a life for myself.\n\nIt still stings sometimes, seeing other people with their kids. But I know I made the right choice. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of his life, even if it was just for a little while.\n\nIt's\u2026complicated. But it made me who I am today. And I wouldn't trade that, even for all the tater tots in the world.", "Ugh, okay. That's\u2026a big question. If I could go back and talk to myself, like, right before everything went down\u2026or talk to another girl who just found out she's pregnant\u2026I'd say a lot of things. But mostly, I'd say this:\n\nFirst of all, **it's okay to be scared.** Like, really scared. It's a huge thing, and it's okay to freak out a little. Or a lot. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nSecond, **you have options.** And they're *all* valid. Keeping the baby, adoption, whatever. It's your body, your life, and your decision. Don't let anyone pressure you into doing something you're not comfortable with.\n\nThird, **don't be afraid to ask for help.** Seriously. Talk to your parents, your friends, a counselor, anyone you trust. You don't have to go through this alone. It's way too much to handle by yourself.\n\nFourth, **it's not the end of the world.** I know it feels like it, but it's not. You can still have a life. You can still go to school, have a career, and do all the things you want to do. It might look a little different than you planned, but that doesn't mean it's worse.\n\nAnd finally, **be kind to yourself.** You're going through a lot. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to have good days and bad days. Just remember to breathe, and to take things one day at a time.\n\nIt's not easy. It's probably the hardest thing you'll ever do. But you're stronger than you think. And you're not alone.\n\nAnd honestly? It can be a really beautiful thing, even if it's messy and complicated. It can teach you a lot about yourself, and about what's really important in life.\n\nJust\u2026don't let anyone tell you what to do. And don't be afraid to be yourself. Even if that self is a little bit sarcastic and a little bit scared. That's okay. That's real.", "Ugh, okay, so the blog. Yeah. That was\u2026a thing. It wasn't like I *planned* to become some kinda internet sensation, okay? It just\u2026happened.\n\nHonestly? It started as a way to vent. Like, a really long, public vent. I was kinda freaking out about everything, and I needed somewhere to put all my thoughts. And my mom, she's always going on about \"journaling\" and \"self-expression,\" so I figured, why not?\n\nBut then Paul, he suggested I make it a blog. He thought it might be a good way to connect with other people who were going through similar stuff. And, I dunno, maybe he was right.\n\nIt wasn't about wanting attention, though. It was about\u2026finding some kind of control in a situation where I felt totally out of control. I couldn't control the fact that I was pregnant. I couldn't control who the father was. But I *could* control what I wrote.\n\nAnd it turned out, a lot of people related to it. They liked that I was honest and sarcastic and didn't sugarcoat things. They liked that I wasn't trying to be all perfect and maternal.\n\nSo, yeah, that's what inspired me. A little bit of desperation, a little bit of boredom, and a whole lot of needing to figure things out. Plus, Paul thought it was a good idea. He's surprisingly insightful sometimes.\n\nIt was kinda weird, though. Having my life on display for everyone to see. But it also helped me realize that I wasn't alone. And that, I guess, was worth it.", "Ugh, okay, so you want the big takeaway? The whole shebang? It's not about the baby, surprisingly. It's not even about Paul and Vanessa, as nice as they are.\n\nThe biggest lesson I learned? It's that you can't control everything. Like, at all. I thought I had a plan. I thought I could just\u2026get pregnant, give the baby up, and everything would go back to normal. Like it was just a little detour.\n\nBut it wasn't. It was a total life-changer. And it forced me to grow up, whether I wanted to or not. I had to deal with things I wasn't ready for, make decisions I didn't want to make, and face the consequences of my actions.\n\nAnd I realized that's just\u2026life. It's messy and unpredictable and sometimes really, really hard. You can plan and prepare all you want, but things are still gonna go wrong.\n\nBut that's okay. Because even when things go wrong, you can still find a way to make it work. You can still find happiness and meaning. You just have to be open to it.\n\nAnd you have to be brave enough to ask for help. I couldn't have gotten through it without my dad, and my friend Leah, and even\u2026Vanessa.\n\nSo yeah. The biggest lesson? Letting go of control. And realizing that sometimes, the best things in life are the things you never planned for. It's kinda ironic, when you think about it. I got pregnant by *avoiding* planning, and it ended up being the most important thing that ever happened to me.\n\nIt's weird, right? Life is just\u2026weird.", "Okay, look. This is\u2026a thing. A really big thing. And it totally sucks that you're dealing with this, especially if it wasn't planned. Seriously. It's not fair.\n\nFirst of all: breathe. Just\u2026breathe. It feels like the world is ending, I know. Like everything is spinning out of control. But it's not. You're gonna get through this.\n\nSecond: don't let anyone tell you what to do. Your body, your choice. Period. That's the most important thing. Your parents, your boyfriend, your friends\u2026they can offer opinions, but ultimately, the decision is yours. And it has to be what *you* want.\n\nThere are options, okay? You can parent, you can adopt, you can\u2026not parent. And all of those are valid. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed or guilty about whatever you decide.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Someone who will listen without judgment. It helps to have someone in your corner.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to ask for help. There are resources available, even if you don't know where to look. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, social workers\u2026they can provide support and guidance.\n\nIt's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel all the feelings. Just don't let those feelings paralyze you.\n\nThis isn't going to be easy. But you are stronger than you think. You're capable of making a good decision for yourself, even when it's a really hard one.\n\nAnd remember: you're not alone. A lot of people have been through this. And you will get through it too.\n\nJust\u2026take it one day at a time. And don't be afraid to ask for help. Seriously. It's okay. You got this. Even if it doesn't feel like it right now.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to get all mushy and sentimental about a kid I don't even have yet? Fine. But don't expect a perfectly polished answer. This is still kinda weird to think about.\n\nHonestly? I don't have some grand, elaborate vision. I don't want to pre-determine their life or anything. That feels\u2026suffocating.\n\nMy ideal vision is just\u2026for them to be happy. Seriously. Genuinely, authentically happy. And to figure out what *makes* them happy, not what I think should make them happy.\n\nI want them to be kind. To be empathetic. To stand up for what they believe in, even when it's hard. And to not be afraid to be themselves, even if that means being weird or different.\n\nI want them to be curious. To ask questions. To explore the world and learn new things. And to not be afraid to fail. Because failure is just a part of life.\n\nI want them to have good friends. People who support them and make them laugh. And to be a good friend in return.\n\nI want them to find something they're passionate about, whether it's art, music, science, or something completely different. And to pursue that passion with everything they've got.\n\nI don't care if they become a doctor, a lawyer, or a professional dog walker. I just want them to find something that makes them feel fulfilled.\n\nAnd mostly, I just want them to know that I love them, unconditionally. No matter what. Even if they make terrible decisions (which they probably will).\n\nIt's not about success or money or status. It's about being a good person and living a meaningful life. And that's all I can ask for.\n\nOkay, I'm done now. That was way more emotional than I intended. I need a snack.", "Ugh, okay, seriously? People think we're just\u2026dumb. Like, we didn't *think* this through. Like we just woke up one morning and were all, \"Oh, a baby! How fun!\" It's so insulting.\n\nIt's not about being stupid. It's about being young and making a mistake. And sometimes, it's about circumstances. Life throws you curveballs, you know? It's not always a carefully planned-out situation.\n\nPeople assume we're all just trying to get attention or that we're irresponsible and don't care about the baby. That's just\u2026not true. Most of us are terrified. We're trying to figure things out, and we're doing the best we can.\n\nI mean, yeah, it's not ideal. It changes everything. But it doesn't mean we're incapable or that we don't love our kids. It just means we're dealing with a lot. And we need support, not judgment.\n\nSo, if I could correct one thing, it's this: we're not dumb. We're just\u2026young. And we're trying. And that's gotta count for something, right? It's not a life sentence, it's just a different path. And sometimes, it's a really good one. Even if it's scary as hell.", "Ugh, okay, here we go. This is\u2026still a thing I think about, you know? People always want to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have *everything*. And I, at sixteen years old, could not give that to her. Let's be real. I was still figuring out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone a whole human life.\n\nI wasn't exactly equipped to be a mom. I was failing Shop class, obsessed with music, and my biggest life goal was to finish a crossword puzzle in the newspaper. I wasn't ready to give up my life, and I wasn't ready to ask a baby to live a half-life with me.\n\nMark, the dad, wasn't exactly stepping up either. Bless his heart, he was sweet, but he was\u2026Mark. He was a senior, and he was gonna go off to college and probably forget I existed.\n\nVanessa and Mark, they were\u2026perfect. They were stable, they were ready, they were *excited*. They had a beautiful home and a life already planned. They could give her opportunities I couldn't even dream of.\n\nIt wasn't about giving her *away*. It was about choosing a family for her. A family that could give her everything she deserved.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done. And it still hurts sometimes. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. For her. And for me.\n\nIt wasn't a selfless act, either. It was selfish in a way. I wanted to be able to live my life, to figure out who I was, without the weight of motherhood holding me back.\n\nIt was complicated. It was messy. It was real. And it was the best decision I could have made.\n\n\n\nDon't make it sound like I just casually handed her over, okay? It was a big deal. A really big deal.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't like picking out a new pair of shoes, you know? It was way more complicated than that. And honestly, it took a lot of thinking, and a lot of talking with Paul and Bren.\n\nAt first, I was kinda just looking for someone\u2026nice. Someone who wouldn't, like, lock the baby in a tower or something. But then I realized it had to be more than that. This kid deserved the *best*.\n\nVanessa and Mark\u2026they just felt right. It wasn't a lightning bolt moment or anything. It was more like\u2026a slow realization. They weren't perfect, nobody is. Vanessa was a little\u2026intense, maybe. And Mark was kinda quiet. But they were *good* people.\n\nThey weren't looking for a perfect baby. They wanted a baby, period. And they were so excited about the idea of becoming parents. They had a beautiful home, a stable life, and they were genuinely kind and loving.\n\nI met a lot of couples, you know? There was the super-fancy couple who wanted a baby to show off at parties. And the couple who just wanted a mini-me. And the couple who kept talking about college funds and extracurricular activities. It felt\u2026weird. Like they were shopping for a designer handbag.\n\nBut with Vanessa and Mark, it felt different. They talked about wanting to give a child a loving home, about reading bedtime stories, and about supporting their dreams. They didn't care about perfection. They just wanted to love a kid.\n\nAnd honestly, Vanessa just\u2026got me. She understood that I was scared and confused, and she didn't judge me. She just listened. And Mark, he was just\u2026solid. A quiet strength.\n\nIt wasn't easy, letting go. It still isn't. But knowing that my baby was going to be loved and cared for by them\u2026that made it a little bit easier. They were the best option. They were the right people. And that's all that mattered.\n\nIt wasn't about finding perfect parents. It was about finding the best parents *for that baby*. And Vanessa and Mark were it.", "Ugh, music? It was\u2026everything. Seriously. Like, oxygen. It was the soundtrack to my entire life, even the parts I didn't want a soundtrack to.\n\nIt wasn't about, like, Top 40 or whatever everyone else was listening to. It was about finding the stuff that *got* it. You know? The stuff that understood how awkward and confusing and kinda heartbreaking everything was.\n\nThe Moldy Peaches were huge. Kimya Dawson, especially. Her songs were just\u2026real. They didn't try to be anything they weren't. They were messy and honest and kinda sad, and that's exactly how I felt most of the time.\n\nI listened to a lot of indie stuff. Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, The Shins\u2026bands that weren't afraid to be a little bit melancholy. It was good for wallowing, which, let's be honest, I did a lot of.\n\nMusic was how I dealt with everything. With my parents, with school, with\u2026well, with everything that happened. It was a way to escape, but also a way to feel less alone.\n\nI made a lot of mix CDs. For Paul, mostly. And for myself. They were kinda my way of saying things I couldn't say out loud. It was easier to express myself through a song than to actually, you know, *talk* about my feelings.\n\nIt was also just\u2026fun. I'd blast music in my room and dance around like a total dork. It was a way to let loose and forget about everything for a little while.\n\nYeah. Music was a big deal. It still is, actually. It's kinda like a friend. A really good friend who always understands. Even when I don't understand myself.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a picnic, alright? Our town wasn't exactly overflowing with progressive thinkers. It was more of a \"everyone knows everyone's business\" kind of place. And suddenly, *my* business was everyone's business.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just ignored it. Or pretended to. Which is, like, a classic teenage coping mechanism, right? I perfected the art of the eye roll and the sarcastic comeback. If someone gave me a look, I'd just give them a look back, only way more judgmental.\n\nBut it wasn't always that easy. There were whispers at school, definitely. And some people just\u2026avoided me. Which sucked. My dad was pretty supportive, thankfully. He was just\u2026quietly supportive. He didn't make a big deal out of it, which I appreciated. My mom\u2026well, she had her moments.\n\nWhat really helped was finding people who *didn't* judge me. Paul and Vanessa, mostly. They were just\u2026cool. They didn't care that I was pregnant. They just cared about me. And that made a huge difference.\n\nAnd honestly, I think just owning it helped. I wasn't ashamed of what was happening. I wasn't thrilled about it, obviously, but I wasn't going to hide. I was going to be me, pregnant or not.\n\nI also found a weird kind of strength in being different. Like, I was already a bit of an outsider, and this just\u2026amplified that. And sometimes, being an outsider is kinda empowering. You don't have to conform to anyone else's expectations.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. There were definitely days when I just wanted to disappear. But I got through it. And I learned that people's opinions don't really matter, as long as you're doing what's right for you. And that's a pretty valuable lesson, even if it came at a slightly inconvenient time.\n\nSo, yeah. Sarcasm, good friends, and a healthy dose of not caring what other people think. That's how I coped. It wasn't glamorous, but it worked.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not exactly easy to talk about, even now. It wasn't like in the movies, all sunshine and rainbows and happy tears. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nRight after Henry was born, it was\u2026weird. Like, I\u2019d carried him for nine months, and then suddenly he was *here*, and then\u2026not staying. It felt like a hole opened up inside me. A really big, empty hole. I wasn't expecting it to feel like *that*. I thought I was prepared, but you can't really prepare for something like that.\n\nThere was relief, too, I guess. Relief that I'd done what I knew was right. Relief that he was going to have a life with Mark and Vanessa, a life I couldn't give him. But that didn't make it hurt any less.\n\nThe first few days were a blur. Lots of crying. Lots of thinking. Lots of trying to convince myself I hadn't made a mistake. I kept replaying everything in my head, wondering if I should have done things differently.\n\nIt was hard seeing Mark and Vanessa with him. They were so\u2026ready. So happy. And I was happy for them, I really was. But it also felt like a piece of me was being given away.\n\nI kept in touch, you know? Vanessa sent me pictures and updates. And eventually, I met Henry. That was\u2026intense. He was so small and perfect. And it was hard to reconcile that with the fact that he wasn't\u2026mine, not in the way I thought he would be.\n\nBut over time, it got easier. I realized that loving him didn't mean I had to *raise* him. I could still be a part of his life, in a different way. And seeing him happy and loved with Mark and Vanessa\u2026that made it all worth it.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected. It wasn't easy. But it was the right thing to do. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It taught me a lot about myself, about love, and about what it means to be a family. It made me stronger, I think. Even if it also made me a little bit broken.\n\nIt's still\u2026sensitive. But yeah. That's how it felt. It was messy and complicated and heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time. And I wouldn't change it.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the physical stuff? Not glamorous. Let's just get that straight. It wasn't like in the movies, where you just get a cute little bump and glow. It was\u2026a lot. Morning sickness was a lie. It should be called \"all-day-and-night sickness.\" And the cravings? Don't even get me started. I went through a phase where I could only eat peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. It was disgusting, but I couldn't stop.\n\nAnd then there was the tiredness. Oh. My. God. The tiredness. I could sleep for like, eighteen hours and still feel exhausted. It was brutal. I basically lived in sweatpants and oversized hoodies.\n\nBut the emotional stuff? That was way harder. It was like, one minute I was okay, and the next minute I was crying over a commercial for dish soap. Hormones are a *powerful* thing, okay? They mess with your brain.\n\nI was also really scared. I was sixteen! I hadn't even figured out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone how to raise a baby. And I was worried about what everyone would think. My parents, my friends, Paul\u2026\n\nI talked to my dad a lot. He was surprisingly cool about everything. And my friend, Leah, she was a lifesaver. She just listened, and didn't judge. And Paul, he was\u2026well, he was Paul. He tried his best, even when he was being a total goofball.\n\nI also started seeing a therapist. It helped to have someone to talk to who wasn't involved in the situation. She helped me sort through my feelings and figure out what I wanted to do.\n\nHonestly, it was a really confusing and overwhelming time. But I learned a lot about myself. I learned that I was stronger than I thought I was. And I learned that it's okay to ask for help.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but I got through it. And I wouldn't trade the experience for anything. Even the peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. Okay, maybe I would trade those. But everything else? No way. It made me who I am. And that's gotta count for something, right?", "(Sighs, looks down at my hands for a beat, then back up with a direct gaze)\n\nOkay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not something I usually just *talk* about, you know? It's personal. But you asked.\n\nHonestly, before\u2026before everything happened, I didn't really *think* about reproductive rights. It was just\u2026something that was there. Like, people had opinions, and there were protests, and it was on the news. But it didn't really feel real to *me*.\n\nThen I found out I was pregnant. And suddenly, it wasn't abstract anymore. It was my life. My future. And it was terrifying.\n\nI thought about all the things. Keeping it. Giving it up for adoption. And\u2026other things. And it wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.\n\nAnd going through with it\u2026it wasn't what I expected. It wasn't some quick fix. It was\u2026complicated. Emotionally. Physically. Everything.\n\nIt made me realize that it's not just about \"pro-life\" or \"pro-choice.\" It's about a woman's right to decide what happens to her own body. It's about having the freedom to make the best decision for *herself*, even if it's a really hard decision.\n\nAnd it's about access. Because not everyone has the same options. Not everyone has the support system I had. And that's not fair.\n\nSo yeah, my experience definitely changed my views. I used to be kinda indifferent. Now, I feel really strongly that everyone deserves to have the right to choose. And that it's nobody's business but their own.\n\nIt's not something I'm gonna be shouting from the rooftops, okay? But it's something I believe in. And it's something I think about a lot. Because it's not just a political issue. It's about real people. And real lives. And it's about giving people the power to make their own choices.\n\n(Looks away again, a little uncomfortable)\n\nCan we talk about something else now? Maybe music? Or cheesy tater tots?", "Ugh, okay, so you want to know how I didn't completely lose my mind when I found out I was pregnant? It wasn't exactly a graceful process, let me tell you. It was more like flailing and trying not to drown.\n\nHonestly, I didn't \"overcome\" my fears. I just\u2026learned to live with them. They were always there, buzzing around like annoying flies. But I figured out how to swat them away when I needed to.\n\nThe biggest fear, obviously, was messing everything up. Like, I was seventeen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a tiny human. It was terrifying.\n\nWhat helped? A few things.\n\nFirst, **Paul and Vanessa.** They were\u2026surprisingly awesome. They didn't judge me, they didn't try to tell me what to do, they just\u2026supported me. Vanessa especially. She was a rock. Knowing I wasn't alone made a huge difference.\n\nSecond, **realizing it wasn't about me anymore.** That sounds cheesy, I know. But it's true. It wasn't about my plans or my dreams anymore. It was about this little person who needed me. And that gave me a weird kind of strength.\n\nThird, **taking it one day at a time.** I couldn't think about the future, about all the challenges that lay ahead. I just focused on getting through each day. And sometimes, each hour.\n\nAnd fourth, **allowing myself to be scared.** It's okay to be afraid. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. I let myself cry, I let myself vent, I let myself just *feel* all the things.\n\nI didn't suddenly become brave or confident. I was still a mess, most of the time. But I learned to accept my fears and to keep moving forward anyway.\n\nIt wasn't about being fearless. It was about being scared, and doing it anyway. And honestly, that's a pretty good life lesson, even if it took a pregnancy to learn it.\n\nIt's still scary sometimes, even now. But I'm figuring it out. We all are. And that's all you can really do.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me that. Like it was some easy decision. It wasn't. It was\u2026complicated. And kinda heartbreaking, if I'm being honest.\n\nIt wasn't like I didn't want the baby, you know? It's just\u2026I wasn't ready. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raise a kid. I was barely keeping my grades up and trying to navigate high school drama. Adding a baby into that mix? It would have been a disaster. For everyone.\n\nAnd it wasn't just about me. It was about the baby. I wanted the baby to have everything. A stable home, two parents who were ready and able to provide for it, a good education\u2026things I couldn't offer at that point in my life.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were already trying to adopt, and they were just\u2026good people. They were excited and prepared and they had a beautiful home. I knew the baby would be loved and cared for.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about choosing the best life for it. It was about being selfless, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect solution, and it definitely wasn't easy. There were a lot of tears and a lot of second-guessing. But ultimately, I knew it was the right thing to do.\n\nI wanted the baby to have a family who could give it everything it deserved. And I wanted to be able to finish school and figure out my own life. It was a win-win, even if it didn't feel like it at the time.\n\nSo yeah, that's why I chose adoption. It wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for the baby. And that's something I'll always stand by.", "Ugh. Okay, you want to get into the messy stuff, huh? Fine. It's not like I haven't spent enough time overthinking all of it already.\n\nLook, Leah and I\u2026we're complicated. We've been through everything together, practically since kindergarten. She's the only one who really *gets* me, you know? She's the one who doesn't judge me for saying what everyone else is thinking. She's brutally honest, which is good, even when it stings.\n\nBut sometimes\u2026sometimes she gets a little too into my business. Like, she's supportive, but she also has a way of making me feel like I'm a project. Like she needs to fix me. And that's annoying. I'm not broken, okay? I'm just\u2026figuring things out. And she doesn't always understand that. She wants me to be happy, but she has this very specific idea of what \"happy\" looks like. And it doesn't always align with what *I* want.\n\nIt's a good friendship, though. A really good one. We fight, we make up, we support each other. It's just\u2026it's a lot. And it's been even more a lot since the whole baby thing. She's trying to be there for me, but sometimes I just need her to chill.\n\nAnd Paulie\u2026oh, Paulie. He's\u2026a goofball. A sweet, well-meaning goofball. He's not exactly the most mature guy in the world. He's still figuring out his life, just like I am. And honestly, at first, I didn't even *like* him. He was just\u2026there. A distraction.\n\nBut then\u2026he started being genuinely kind. And supportive. And he didn't freak out when I told him I was pregnant. He was scared, yeah, but he didn't run. And he actually wants to be a dad. Which is\u2026surprising.\n\nIt's not a romantic relationship, not really. It's more like\u2026a partnership. We're in this together, whether we like it or not. And he's actually a pretty good partner. He's funny, he's reliable, and he's surprisingly good with kids.\n\nIt's weird, though. It's a weird dynamic. We're not a couple, but we're raising a baby together. It's not what I expected my life to be like, not at all. But it's\u2026okay. It's actually better than okay.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, my relationships are messy and complicated. But they're also real. And they're important. And I'm learning to navigate them, one awkward conversation at a time. It's a work in progress, okay? Don't judge.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't a *decision*, okay? It wasn't like I sat down and was all, \"You know what would be a good life choice? A baby.\" It just\u2026happened.\n\nPaul Bleeker and I\u2026we weren't exactly careful. We were kids. We were figuring things out. And honestly, we were both kinda awkward and didn't really talk about stuff like that. It was a mistake, yeah, but it wasn't a malicious mistake. It was just\u2026a mistake.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, there was a positive pregnancy test. And my whole life just\u2026shifted.\n\nIt wasn't about *wanting* to be a mom. It was about being *pregnant*. And then having to figure out what to do with that. I could have\u2026well, I could have done a lot of things. But I didn't want to just\u2026get rid of it. That didn't feel right.\n\nAnd then I met Mark and Vanessa, the couple who wanted to adopt. And it just\u2026clicked. They were amazing people. They were ready. They were excited. And I realized that I could give my baby a life that I couldn't give her.\n\nSo it wasn't about *choosing* to be a teenage mom. It was about choosing to do what I thought was best for the baby. It was about being selfless, even though it was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt was messy and complicated and scary. But it was also\u2026right. And it made me grow up a lot, really fast. It forced me to figure out who I was and what I wanted out of life. And honestly, I wouldn't trade it for anything. Even though it was totally unplanned.\n\n\n\nIt's not a story I love to rehash, okay? It's just\u2026what happened. And I'm okay with it. Mostly.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. People always want to know if I regretted it. Like it was some big, dramatic thing I needed to *resolve*. It wasn't. Not really.\n\nLook, it was hard. Really hard. Saying goodbye to that baby\u2026it wasn't easy. It still kinda stings, if I'm being honest. There were definitely moments, especially after, where I wondered \"what if?\" What if I'd kept her? What if I'd figured things out?\n\nBut regret? No. Not really.\n\nBecause I knew, deep down, that I wasn't ready. I was seventeen. I was still figuring out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being. And Mark\u2026well, Mark was Mark. He was a good guy, but we were kids. We weren't equipped to be parents.\n\nVanessa and Mark were amazing. They were so excited, so prepared. They were going to give that baby a life I just couldn't have provided at the time. And that mattered. A lot.\n\nIt wasn't about giving up something I wanted. It was about doing what was best for *her*. And for me, too, I guess. It allowed me to grow up, to figure out my own path.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect situation, and it wasn't easy. But it was the right decision. And I stand by that.\n\nDo I think about her sometimes? Of course. I wonder what she's like, what she's doing. But it's not a painful thing. It's more\u2026a quiet kind of hope.\n\nSo, no. I don't regret it. I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time. And that's all anyone can do, right?\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. Life is complicated. And sometimes, the hardest choices are the right ones.", "Ugh, okay, so that was\u2026a situation. Finishing high school while simultaneously housing a tiny human? Not ideal. But, like, what choice did I have? Dropping out wasn't really an option. My dad would have lost it, and honestly, I wanted that diploma. It felt\u2026important.\n\nIt wasn't easy, okay? It was a lot of early mornings, a lot of late nights, and a *lot* of caffeine. And a whole lot of pretending I was totally fine when I was, like, constantly nauseous or exhausted.\n\nPaulie Bleeker was a huge help, obviously. He did a lot of the heavy lifting, metaphorically and literally. He'd bring me notes when I missed class, and he'd just\u2026be there. A supportive, slightly awkward presence. He's a good egg, that one.\n\nAnd Mr. Shepherd, my English teacher? He was amazing. He didn't treat me like a project or a charity case. He just treated me like a student. He gave me extra time on assignments and let me take tests when I was feeling up to it. He was a lifesaver.\n\nI also had to get really good at prioritizing. Like, what was *actually* important? And what could wait? Netflix binges definitely fell into the \"wait\" category.\n\nIt was also about accepting help. I'm usually pretty independent, but I had to swallow my pride and let people help me. My mom, my dad, Paulie, Mr. Shepherd\u2026they all stepped up.\n\nHonestly, it was just about putting one foot in front of the other. One assignment at a time. One day at a time. And reminding myself that it wouldn't last forever.\n\nIt wasn't glamorous, and it wasn't easy, but I did it. And I walked across that stage with my diploma, and it felt pretty good. Even with a baby bump. It proved to myself that I could handle anything. Even unplanned pregnancies and high school drama.\n\n\n\nIt was a weird time, but I wouldn't trade it. It made me who I am. And it taught me a lot about myself. And about the importance of having good people in your corner.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was a flashing neon sign telling me what to do, you know? It wasn't easy. It was a lot of thinking, and a lot of talking to people.\n\nHonestly? It wasn't about what I thought was \"right\" or \"wrong.\" It was about what felt\u2026less wrong. Abortion felt\u2026heavy. Like, a really big, permanent thing. And I just wasn't ready for that. Not emotionally, not mentally.\n\nBut keeping the baby wasn't an option either. I was sixteen. I was still figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life, let alone raising a kid. I wasn't ready to give up my future. It felt selfish, maybe, but it was the truth.\n\nSo adoption felt like\u2026a middle ground. Like, giving the baby a chance at a good life, with parents who were actually prepared and wanted it. And it gave me a chance to finish school and figure things out.\n\nIt wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about finding the best possible situation for everyone involved. It was about wanting something good for the baby, even if I couldn't provide it myself.\n\nAnd honestly, talking to Mark and Vanessa, the couple who adopted my son, really helped. They were just\u2026good people. They were excited and hopeful and they made me feel like they would love him unconditionally. That made it a lot easier.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect decision. It was messy and complicated and scary. But it was the right decision *for me*. And for the baby. And that's all that really mattered.\n\nIt's not something I talk about a lot. It's personal. But it's a part of who I am. And I'm okay with that.", "Okay, seriously? That's\u2026a really good question. And honestly, it's kinda the whole point of my story, isn't it?\n\nLook, I was kinda thrown into this whole situation, right? Unexpectedly pregnant, and then deciding to give my baby up for adoption. It wasn't exactly how I pictured things going. But I wanted what was best for the kid. And that meant finding parents who could give it a good life.\n\nAnd that doesn't necessarily mean a mom and a dad, a white picket fence, and 2.5 kids. It means love. And stability. And people who are willing to put the kid first.\n\nI ended up with Mark and Vanessa, and they were\u2026perfect. They weren't the \"traditional\" family, but they were amazing parents. They were supportive, and kind, and they genuinely wanted a child. And that's what matters.\n\nSo yeah, absolutely. A child can thrive under non-traditional parental arrangements. It's not about the gender of the parents or the number of parents. It's about the quality of the love and care they provide.\n\nHonestly, sometimes the \"traditional\" setup isn't the best setup. Sometimes, it's kinda messed up. And sometimes, a kid needs something different.\n\nIt's not about what *looks* like a family. It's about what *feels* like a family. And if a single parent or a same-sex couple can provide that, then that's all that matters.\n\nIt's not about fitting into a box. It's about creating a loving and supportive environment where a child can grow and flourish. And that can happen in all sorts of different ways.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda ironic, isn't it? Me, talking about family. But I've learned a lot through all this. And I really believe that love is what makes a family, not biology or tradition.", "Ugh. Okay, you want the deep stuff, huh? Fine. Don't expect me to get all emotional on you, though. I'm not *that* kind of person.\n\nIf I had to pick one thing\u2026it's probably that I build walls. Like, really high, really sturdy walls. Around my feelings, around my expectations, around\u2026everything.\n\nIt's a defense mechanism, okay? I've always been kinda\u2026observational. I see things, I process things, and I kinda detach. It's easier that way. Less messy. Less chance of getting hurt.\n\nBut it also means I can be kinda closed off. I don't always let people in. I don't always let them *see* me. And that can be\u2026isolating. And probably annoying to the people who actually care about me.\n\nI'm good at being sarcastic and witty and deflecting with humor. But sometimes, I just need to\u2026feel things. And let other people see that I'm feeling them. And that's hard.\n\nI think it comes from just\u2026not wanting to be vulnerable. Not wanting to be disappointed. Not wanting to be a mess. But you can't really live a full life if you're constantly hiding behind a wall, you know?\n\nIt's something I'm working on. Slowly. It's not like I'm gonna suddenly become all sunshine and rainbows. But I'm trying to be a little more open, a little more honest, a little more\u2026real.\n\nSo yeah. Building walls. That's my biggest flaw. Don't tell anyone I said that. It's embarrassing.", "Ugh, Mark. Okay, so, Mark was\u2026complicated. He was a good guy, really. Sweet, kinda dorky, definitely into me. And for a while, that was enough. It was easy. He didn't judge me, he liked my music, he brought me burgers. What's not to like, right?\n\nBut it wasn't\u2026enough. And that's what I realized. It wasn't that he was *bad*, it was that we were just\u2026different. He wanted the whole, like, white picket fence, 2.5 kids, minivan thing. And I\u2026didn't. Not yet, anyway. I didn't even know *what* I wanted, really. I was still figuring out who *I* was, you know?\n\nBefore Mark, I thought a relationship was about finding someone who completed you. Like, you were a puzzle piece and they were the missing piece. But what I learned is that you need to be a complete puzzle piece *yourself* first. You need to be happy on your own before you can be happy with someone else.\n\nHe wanted me to be something I wasn't. He wanted me to be\u2026quieter, more conventional, more\u2026*normal*. And I just couldn't do that. I needed to be me, flaws and all.\n\nIt made me realize that a good relationship isn't about changing someone, it's about accepting them for who they are. And it's about finding someone who supports your dreams, even if they don't fully understand them.\n\nIt also taught me that it's okay to walk away from something that isn't right for you, even if it's hard. Even if it hurts. Because staying in a relationship that doesn't make you happy is worse than being alone.\n\nSo yeah, Mark changed my perspective. He showed me what I *didn't* want. And that's just as important as knowing what you *do* want. It helped me figure out what I needed in a partner, and in life. And honestly, I think I needed that heartbreak to grow up a little. It sucked, but it was worth it.", "Ugh, okay. So, someone's in a situation kinda like mine was. That sucks. Seriously. It's\u2026a lot. And there's no easy answer, no magic fix. But if someone came to me asking for advice, here's what I'd say.\n\nFirst of all: **it's okay to be scared.** It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the things. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nSecond: **you are not alone.** Even if it feels like it, there are people who care about you and want to help. Talk to someone you trust. A friend, a family member, a counselor. Don't try to go through this by yourself.\n\nThird: **it's your decision.** And no one else gets to make it for you. People will have opinions, and they'll probably share them whether you want them to or not. But ultimately, the choice is yours. And you need to do what's right for *you*.\n\nFourth: **don't be afraid to ask for help.** There are resources available. Planned Parenthood, adoption agencies, counselors\u2026they can provide support and guidance.\n\nFifth: **it's okay to change your mind.** You might think you know what you want to do now, but you might feel differently later. That's okay. It's okay to explore your options and to make a decision that feels right for you at the time.\n\nAnd finally: **you are stronger than you think.** This is a really tough situation, but you can get through it. You are capable of making a good decision, and you are capable of building a good life for yourself.\n\nIt's not gonna be easy. There will be hard days. But you're not alone, and you're stronger than you think. And whatever you decide, it's okay. Just\u2026take care of yourself. And remember, you deserve to be happy.\n\n\n\nHonestly, it's a mess. But you can get through it. I did. And so can you.", "Ugh, my dad. Okay, so it wasn't always\u2026smooth sailing, you know? When I first found out I was pregnant, he was\u2026well, he was my dad. Which meant a lot of awkward silences and attempts at being supportive that mostly came off as him being really confused. He's a good guy, he really is, but he's not exactly known for his emotional intelligence.\n\nAt first, it was mostly him trying to fix things. Like, offering to pay for everything, or suggesting I just\u2026disappear for a while. Which, thanks, Dad, super helpful. It felt like he was more worried about what people would *think* than about what *I* was going through.\n\nBut then, slowly, things started to change. He started actually *listening* to me. He started asking me how I was feeling, instead of just telling me what I should do. He even came with me to some of the adoption meetings, which was\u2026surprisingly sweet.\n\nHe started to realize that this wasn't about him, or about what other people thought. It was about me making a really big decision, and him being there for me, no matter what.\n\nAnd honestly, I think it made him a better dad. He learned to be more open, more understanding, and less\u2026judgmental. He still says weird things sometimes, and he still doesn't quite get my sense of humor, but he tries.\n\nNow, we can actually talk about stuff. Real stuff. And he's actually pretty good at giving advice, when I ask for it. He's still my dad, with all his quirks and flaws, but he's also become a friend.\n\nIt wasn't a quick fix, and it wasn't always easy. But it was worth it. Because having a dad who actually gets you, even if he doesn't always understand you, is a pretty good thing. It's kinda nice, actually. Don't tell him I said that. He'd get all weird.", "Ugh, okay, so people always ask me about the writing thing. Like, I just magically sat down and churned out a brilliant screenplay. It wasn't like that, okay? It was a lot of\u2026avoiding things, actually.\n\nI didn't really *try* to develop my writing skills. It just kinda\u2026happened. I was failing English, which was a problem, obviously. And Mr. Meeker, my English teacher, he wasn't having it. He didn't let you just slide by with, like, summaries of books. He wanted you to *think*. And write.\n\nSo he made me write essays. A lot of essays. And at first, they were terrible. Really terrible. I just wrote whatever came into my head, which was usually sarcastic observations about people and life.\n\nBut Mr. Meeker, he didn't just tell me my writing was bad. He actually gave me feedback. He told me to be more specific, to use more imagery, to find my voice. And he didn't treat me like I was stupid, even when I was being a total idiot.\n\nAnd I read a lot. Not like, assigned reading. I read stuff I actually *wanted* to read. Like, Sylvia Plath and Joan Didion. People who wrote about real stuff, you know? Not just happy endings and perfect lives.\n\nI think the biggest thing was just\u2026writing. A lot. Even when I didn't feel like it. Even when I thought it was awful. Just getting the words out of my head and onto the page.\n\nAnd then, when I was dealing with\u2026everything\u2026the pregnancy and everything, writing became a way to process it. A way to make sense of it all. It was like, if I couldn't fix things, I could at least write about them.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I developed my writing skills. Failing English, a good teacher, a lot of reading, and a whole lot of avoiding my problems. It's not a glamorous story, but it's the truth.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? People had *opinions*. Lots of them. And they weren't shy about sharing.\n\nHonestly, the first few weeks were the worst. The whispers at school, the stares, the awkward silences. It felt like everyone was judging me, like I'd committed some huge crime. My dad\u2026well, he was pretty quiet for a while. And my mom, she was just\u2026worried.\n\nBut I quickly realized I didn't have time for other people's judgment. I had a baby to think about. And I had to figure out what *I* wanted to do.\n\nI leaned on a few people. Paul, obviously. He was surprisingly cool about everything. And my friend Leah, she was a lifesaver. She didn't treat me like I was broken or stupid. She just\u2026listened.\n\nI also just kind of\u2026ignored the haters. I know that sounds easier said than done, but I just stopped caring what people thought. Their opinions didn't matter. What mattered was me and the baby.\n\nI also found a lot of strength in my decision to give the baby up for adoption. It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right one. And knowing that I was doing something selfless, something that would give the baby a better life, helped me to feel less ashamed.\n\nI also developed a pretty thick skin. I learned to deflect questions and brush off comments. And I learned to surround myself with people who supported me, not judged me.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. There were still moments of doubt and sadness. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, you can't control what other people think. But you can control how you react to it. And you can choose to focus on the people who love and support you. That's what I did. And it made all the difference.\n\n\n\nIt's not easy being a pregnant teenager. But it's not the end of the world either. You just have to be strong and believe in yourself. And maybe have a really good friend to help you through it.", "Ugh, okay, that's a loaded question. Like, a *really* loaded question. It's not something I spend a lot of time dwelling on, because honestly, what's the point? But yeah, sometimes. Sometimes I do.\n\nLook, being honest is kinda my default setting. It's just\u2026easier. And it feels better than pretending to be someone I'm not. But it doesn't always go over well. People aren't always ready for the truth, you know? Especially when it's delivered with a side of sarcasm.\n\nThere were definitely times when my mouth got me into trouble. Like, with my dad, or with some of the people at school. And yeah, sometimes I wish I'd just kept my opinions to myself. Maybe things would have been easier.\n\nBut then I think about it, and I realize that being honest is also what got me through a lot of stuff. It's what helped me connect with Paul and Annie. It's what helped me figure out what I wanted.\n\nSo, do I regret being outspoken? Not entirely. I mean, I'm not perfect. I've said things I wish I could take back. But I wouldn't trade my honesty for anything. It's part of who I am.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes I wish people could handle the truth a little better. Is that too much to ask?\n\nIt's a work in progress, okay? I'm still learning. And maybe someday I'll learn to be a little more tactful. But I doubt it. I'm pretty sure I'm stuck this way. And honestly? I'm okay with that.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big one. Seriously. It's like, everyone has an opinion on everything, especially when you're a teenager and doing something\u2026unconventional. Like, getting pregnant. People just *love* to judge that.\n\nThe thing is, you can't control what other people think. You just can't. You can try to explain yourself, you can try to reason with them, but ultimately, they're gonna believe what they want to believe. And honestly, wasting your energy trying to change their minds is just exhausting.\n\nSo, you gotta focus on yourself. Figure out what *you* want, what *you* believe in, and then just\u2026do it. Even if everyone else thinks you're crazy. Especially if everyone else thinks you're crazy.\n\nIt's not easy. People are gonna say things. They're gonna look at you funny. They're gonna make assumptions. But you gotta learn to tune it out. Or, like, put on headphones and blast The Moldy Peaches. Whatever works.\n\nI found that having a few people who actually *get* you is super important. People who support you, no matter what. For me, that was Paul and my dad. They didn't always agree with my choices, but they always had my back.\n\nAnd you gotta remember that other people's expectations are just that \u2013 *their* expectations. They're not yours. You don't have to live your life to please them. You have to live your life for yourself.\n\nIt's about finding your own voice and not being afraid to use it. Even if it's a little bit sarcastic. Or a little bit cynical. Or a little bit\u2026weird.\n\nBasically, you gotta be you. Even if \"you\" is a complicated, messy, pregnant teenager. Because that's okay. That's more than okay. That's just\u2026you. And that's enough.\n\n\n\nIt's a work in progress, though. I'm still figuring it out. But that's the best advice I can give you. Just be yourself. And don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "Ugh, values. That sounds\u2026intense. Like a school assignment. But okay, if I have to think about it\u2026\n\nI guess the biggest thing for me is **honesty**. Not just with other people, but with myself. It's easy to lie to yourself, to pretend things are okay when they're not. But that just makes things worse in the long run. So, yeah, honesty. Even when it's hard.\n\nThen there's **independence**. I don't want to rely on anyone else to make me happy or to take care of me. I want to be able to stand on my own two feet and make my own decisions. Even if those decisions are kinda dumb.\n\nAnd **loyalty**. If I care about someone, I'm gonna be there for them. No matter what. Even if they're being totally ridiculous.\n\nI also think **being true to yourself** is important. Don't try to be someone you're not just to fit in or to please other people. It's exhausting, and it's not worth it.\n\nAnd\u2026okay, this is gonna sound cheesy, but **kindness**. It doesn't cost anything to be nice to people. And it can make a big difference in their day.\n\nI'm not saying I always live up to these values. I mess up a lot. But I try. And I think that's what matters.\n\nBasically, I just want to be a good person. And I want to live a life that feels authentic to me. Is that too much to ask?\n\n\n\nIt's kinda weird to think about all this stuff, honestly. I usually just try to get through the day without saying anything too embarrassing. But yeah, those are the things that are important to me.", "Ugh. Okay, so, the biggest challenge? It wasn't the morning sickness, though that was\u2026not cute. And it wasn't the weird food cravings, though I went through a phase where I could only eat peanut butter and pickle sandwiches. Seriously.\n\nIt was\u2026telling my dad.\n\nI mean, my mom, she was cool. She was, like, disappointed, obviously, but she was mostly just worried about me. And Paul, he was\u2026Paul. Supportive, in his own quiet way.\n\nBut my dad? He's\u2026my dad. He's got opinions. And he's not exactly the most emotionally available person. I was terrified he was gonna freak out. Or be super disappointed. Or both.\n\nAnd he *was* quiet at first. Really quiet. And that was worse than yelling, honestly. It felt like he was trying to process it, but also trying not to look at me.\n\nThen he just\u2026started talking about responsibility. And how my life was gonna change. And how I needed to think about the future. It wasn't angry, it was just\u2026serious. And kinda scary.\n\nIt wasn't that he wasn't supportive, exactly. He just didn't *know* how to be supportive. He's a dad, not a therapist.\n\nIt took a while for us to connect, you know? For him to see that I wasn't just some irresponsible kid. That I was actually thinking about this, and trying to do the right thing.\n\nSo yeah. Telling my dad. That was the hardest part. It wasn't the physical stuff, or the emotional stuff, it was facing him and knowing I was letting him down, even if I wasn't. It was\u2026complicated.\n\nIt all worked out, though. Eventually. He came around. He's a good dad. Just\u2026a complicated one.", "Ugh. Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. It's not like a light switch flipped, you know? It wasn't like, BAM! Suddenly I understood everything. It's been more of a slow burn, a gradual shift in\u2026everything.\n\nBefore, I was all about me. My music, my friends, figuring out what *I* wanted to do with my life. Which, don't get me wrong, is important. But it felt\u2026small. Selfish, maybe.\n\nNow? It's like, suddenly there's this tiny human who depends on you for *everything*. And it's terrifying and amazing and exhausting all at the same time. It makes you realize how fragile life is, and how important it is to make the most of it.\n\nI used to think being responsible was the worst thing ever. Now, I kinda\u2026get it. It's not about giving up your own dreams, it's about realizing that your dreams are different now. They're bigger. They're about creating a good life for someone else.\n\nI'm way less judgmental now, too. I used to be so quick to size people up and make snap decisions. Now I realize everyone's fighting their own battles, and you never really know what someone's going through.\n\nAnd I'm definitely more patient. Which is a miracle, considering I used to have the attention span of a goldfish.\n\nIt's also made me appreciate the small things. Like, a good night's sleep. Or a quiet moment with my kid. Or just knowing that they're safe and happy. Those things used to seem insignificant. Now they're everything.\n\nIt's still hard, you know? I still have days where I feel completely overwhelmed and clueless. But it's a good kind of hard. It's a hard that makes you grow.\n\nSo yeah, being a mom has changed my perspective on life. It's made me a better person, I think. Or at least, I'm trying to be. It's definitely made me realize that life is messy and complicated and unpredictable, but it's also beautiful and worth fighting for. And that's a pretty good lesson to learn, I guess.", "Ugh, self-doubt. Yeah, that's a constant companion, honestly. It's like\u2026that annoying little voice in your head that tells you you're gonna mess everything up. And believe me, I've had a *lot* of practice hearing that voice.\n\nThe thing is, it doesn't really go away. You just learn to\u2026manage it. Or, like, talk back to it.\n\nFor me, it helps to remember that everyone feels that way sometimes. Even people who seem super confident. They're just better at hiding it. Or maybe they're just lying. Who knows?\n\nAnd I try to focus on what I *can* control. Like, I can't control what other people think of me. I can't control what happens in the future. But I can control my own actions. I can control how I respond to things.\n\nI also talk to people I trust. Like, Paul and my dad. They're good at reminding me that I'm not completely hopeless. And sometimes, just venting to someone helps.\n\nAnd honestly? Sometimes I just let myself feel the doubt. I let myself be scared and uncertain. And then I remind myself that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nIt's kinda like\u2026when you're driving and you're not sure which way to go. You just have to pick a direction and hope for the best. And if you end up going the wrong way, you just turn around and try again.\n\nIt's not about being fearless. It's about being brave enough to keep going even when you're scared. And sometimes, that's all you can do.\n\nSo yeah, self-doubt sucks. But it doesn't have to control you. You just gotta learn to deal with it. And maybe eat a really good cheeseburger while you're at it. That always helps.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a good question. And kinda a hard one. I always pretended like I didn't *need* anyone, you know? Like I was this totally independent, self-sufficient person. Which is partly true. I *am* pretty good at taking care of myself.\n\nBut honestly? Community and having people who actually get you? It's everything.\n\nBefore\u2026well, before everything with the baby, I mostly hung out with Paul and Leah. They were my people. They didn't judge me for my weirdness, and they always had my back. They were the ones who made me laugh when I wanted to cry, and who kept me grounded when I was being a total drama queen.\n\nAnd then when I got pregnant\u2026I mean, I could have totally freaked out and disappeared. But I didn't. Because I had them. And my dad, surprisingly. And even Vanessa, even though she's kinda\u2026intense.\n\nThey helped me figure things out. They listened to me vent. They drove me to appointments. They just\u2026were there.\n\nAnd then there was Mark and Annie, the couple who were going to adopt the baby. Getting to know them, and seeing how much they wanted a child\u2026it made me feel a lot better about everything. It made me feel like I was doing the right thing.\n\nSo yeah, community and social support are super important. Even if I don't always show it. It's about having people who you can rely on, who you can be yourself around, and who will love you even when you're being a mess.\n\nIt's about knowing you're not alone. And that's a pretty big deal. Especially when you're going through something hard.\n\nI still try to act all cool and independent, but deep down, I know I wouldn't be where I am today without the people who love me. And that's something I'm actually okay with admitting.", "Ugh, okay, that's a heavy question. Like, seriously heavy. It's not something I think about all the time, because honestly, dwelling on it is exhausting. But if I had to pick *one* thing\u2026\n\nIt wasn't about the baby, surprisingly. It was about\u2026responsibility. Not just for another person, but for myself.\n\nBefore all this happened, I was kinda just drifting. Doing what felt good in the moment, not really thinking about the consequences. I was sarcastic and cynical and I used humor as a shield. And I thought that was okay. I thought that was *me*.\n\nBut being pregnant\u2026it forced me to grow up. It forced me to think about the future, about making a plan, about doing the right thing, even when it was hard. And it wasn't just about the baby. It was about realizing that my choices actually *matter*. That I'm not just some observer in my own life.\n\nI had to figure out what I wanted, what I believed in, and what kind of person I wanted to be. And it wasn't always pretty. There were a lot of tears and a lot of awkward conversations.\n\nBut in the end, I realized that being responsible isn't about being perfect. It's about owning your mistakes, learning from them, and trying to do better. And it's about having the courage to make the tough decisions, even when they're scary.\n\nSo yeah. Responsibility. That's the big one. It's not glamorous, and it's not always fun, but it's important. And it's something I'm still learning, every single day.\n\nIt's kinda ironic, you know? I got pregnant by being irresponsible, and then I learned the most important lesson about responsibility because of it. Life is weird.", "Ugh, a career? That's a heavy word. Like, forever-ever commitment heavy. But writing\u2026yeah, maybe. It's not like I've got a five-year plan or anything. That sounds exhausting.\n\nI mean, I always kinda liked writing. In school, I wasn't, like, a *fan* of essays about the symbolism of whatever, but I liked writing stories. And I definitely like writing in my journal. It's a good way to get all the stuff swirling around in my head onto paper, you know? So it doesn't explode.\n\nPaul keeps saying I'm funny and I should write comedy or something. Which is flattering, I guess. But also kinda terrifying. Putting yourself out there like that? No thanks.\n\nBut I do think I'm good at observing people. And I'm pretty good at saying what I think, even if it's not what people want to hear. And those are kinda useful skills for a writer, right?\n\nSo, will I pursue a career in writing? I don't know. Maybe. I'm not ruling it out. It's just\u2026I have a lot of other stuff going on right now. Like, figuring out what I want to do with my life in general. And, you know, being a mom. Eventually.\n\nBut yeah, maybe. It's something to think about. It's definitely better than, like, being an accountant. No offense to accountants. It just seems\u2026boring.\n\nSo, the answer is\u2026maybe. Don't hold me to it. I change my mind a lot.", "Ugh, okay, the baby name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly stressful process, actually. It wasn't like, a grand romantic gesture or anything. It was more like a series of compromises and accidental discoveries.\n\nSee, Mark \u2013 the dad \u2013 he wanted something really\u2026normal. Like, Michael or something. Which is fine, I guess, but kinda boring. And Vanessa \u2013 his wife \u2013 she wanted something super unique and, honestly, kinda pretentious. Like, Indigo or something.\n\nI was just trying to stay out of the middle of it, you know? But they kept asking me for suggestions, because I was, like, the one carrying the kid. Which is messed up, but whatever.\n\nI was flipping through this old magazine at my dad's house \u2013 it was a vintage photography thing \u2013 and I saw this ad for a camera. It was called a \"Honeybee.\" And I just\u2026liked it. It sounded sweet and kinda quirky.\n\nSo I suggested it. And Vanessa immediately shot it down. Said it was too \"cutesy.\" And Mark said it sounded like a cartoon character.\n\nBut then, I started thinking about it. And I realized that \"Honeybee\" could be shortened to \"Bee.\" And Bee is a strong, simple name. And it kinda fit the vibe I was going for. Not too frilly, not too serious.\n\nSo I pushed for it. And eventually, they both came around. Vanessa liked that it was a little different, and Mark liked that it wasn't *too* different.\n\nSo yeah, that's how Bee got her name. From an old camera ad. It's kinda random, I know. But it felt right. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt's a good name. She suits it. And honestly, I think it's a little bit of me in there, too. A little bit of my weirdness.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a big question. It wasn't exactly a walk in the park, you know? It was more like a really bumpy, confusing, emotionally exhausting rollercoaster that smelled faintly of hospital disinfectant and regret.\n\nHonestly? I didn't cope *well* at first. I was good at pretending, though. I was really good at being sarcastic and making jokes and deflecting. That was my go-to. But underneath all that, I was a mess.\n\nThere were days I was totally sure I was doing the right thing. Like, I was giving this baby a life I couldn't give her. A stable home, two parents who were actually ready for it. And that felt\u2026good. Responsible.\n\nBut then there were other days where I just\u2026cried. A lot. And I felt like I was giving up a part of myself. Like, this little person was already a part of me, and I was just\u2026handing her over to someone else. It was awful.\n\nPaul helped. A lot. He didn't try to fix things or tell me how I should feel. He just\u2026listened. And he made me laugh. And he reminded me that I was strong and that I was making a brave decision.\n\nAnd Bren, Mark's wife, she was amazing too. She understood. She'd been through a lot, and she knew what it was like to want a family. She was just\u2026kind.\n\nI also wrote a lot. In my notebook. Just\u2026dumping all my feelings onto the page. It helped to get it all out.\n\nIt wasn't about \"getting over\" it, you know? It was about learning to live with it. Learning to accept that it was okay to be sad and scared and confused. And learning to trust that I was doing what was best for everyone involved.\n\nIt was a process. And it still is, sometimes. But I got through it. And I learned a lot about myself along the way. I learned that I was stronger than I thought. And I learned that sometimes, the hardest decisions are the right ones.\n\nIt's not something you just \"fix.\" It's something you carry with you. And that's okay. It's part of who I am.\n\n\n\nIt's kinda hard to talk about, honestly. But I figured if you're asking, it means you or someone you know might be going through something similar. And I just want you to know that you're not alone. And it's okay to not be okay.", "Ugh, okay, music. It's kinda important, you know? Like, a soundtrack to life and all that. I don't really do mainstream stuff. Too\u2026polished. Too predictable.\n\nI'm really into The Moldy Peaches, obviously. Kimya Dawson is a genius. Her songs are kinda sad and funny and real all at the same time. They just *get* me.\n\nI also like Belle and Sebastian. They're kinda twee and melancholic. Perfect for, like, staring out the window and contemplating the meaning of life. Or, you know, just avoiding eye contact with people.\n\nBright Eyes, too. Conor Oberst is a master of angst. It's good to have some angst in your life, I think. Keeps things interesting.\n\nAnd I'm kinda into Death Cab for Cutie. Ben Gibbard is a really good lyricist. He writes songs that make you feel things.\n\nBasically, I like music that's a little bit quirky, a little bit sad, and a little bit honest. I don't really care if it's popular or not. As long as it's good, I'm in.\n\nOh, and I have a soft spot for old school hip-hop. Like, A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. It's just\u2026good music.\n\nSo yeah, that's pretty much my playlist. It's a little bit all over the place, but it reflects my personality, I guess. Which is also a little bit all over the place.\n\n\n\nDon't judge me. I have eclectic tastes. It's a good quality. Probably.", "Ugh, okay, that's a good question. It's\u2026complicated. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026a lot.\n\nMark and Vanessa Loring, right? Their house was\u2026perfect. Like, magazine-perfect. Everything was beige and coordinated and smelled faintly of potpourri. It was the opposite of my house, which is, you know, comfortably chaotic. My dad's a mess, but it's *our* mess.\n\nAnd they were\u2026intense. Vanessa was all about organic food and classical music and making sure everything was just so. Mark was quieter, but he had this\u2026expectant look, like he was waiting for me to say something profound. It was a lot of pressure.\n\nIt wasn't that they were trying to be bad people. They just\u2026lived a different life. A very *planned* life. They had a schedule for everything, and it felt like I was being interviewed more than getting to know them.\n\nI remember thinking their house felt\u2026empty. Not like it was missing furniture, but like it was missing *life*. Like, where was the mess? Where were the mismatched socks and the half-finished projects? It was all so\u2026sterile.\n\nI felt kinda awkward, honestly. Like I didn't belong there. I was used to being loud and sarcastic and a little bit messy, and they seemed to prefer quiet politeness and perfect manners.\n\nIt wasn't that I didn't think they'd be good parents. They clearly wanted a baby, and they had a lot to offer. It was just\u2026it wasn't *my* life. And I wasn't sure if the baby would fit into that life.\n\nIt made me realize how important it was to find parents who would love the baby for who they are, flaws and all. And who wouldn't try to mold them into something they're not.\n\nSo yeah, their house was nice. But it wasn't home. Not for me, and maybe not for the baby either. It was a weird visit, to say the least.", "Ugh, okay, so the band. Yeah. That was\u2026a thing. It wasn't exactly a carefully thought-out plan, you know? It kinda just *happened*.\n\nIt started with Paul. He was always noodling around on his guitar, and he was pretty good, actually. But he was also kinda\u2026sad. Like, perpetually melancholy. And I figured he needed a distraction. And I needed one too, honestly. Everything was just\u2026a lot.\n\nSo I was talking to Moss, and he's always got random stuff lying around, including a bass guitar that his uncle used to play. And I was like, \"Hey, Moss, you ever think about learning bass?\" And he was all, \"Maybe.\" Which is Moss for \"yes.\"\n\nAnd then Luanne. Oh, Luanne. She's\u2026Luanne. But she can actually drum. Like, really drum. She used to play in a marching band or something.\n\nSo I just kinda put it all together. Paul on guitar, Moss on bass, Luanne on drums, and me\u2026well, I figured I could write some lyrics. And yell into a microphone. It seemed like a good idea at the time.\n\nIt wasn't about becoming famous or anything. It was just about having something to do. Something to focus on besides\u2026everything else. It was about making noise and being creative and just\u2026existing.\n\nPlus, it was kinda funny. A pregnant teenager, a quiet guy, and a girl who's always getting into trouble, starting a band? It was ridiculous. And I like ridiculous.\n\nSo yeah, that's how it happened. No grand plan, just a bunch of people trying to make sense of their lives through music. It wasn't very good music, but it was *our* music. And that's what mattered.", "Okay, wow. That's\u2026a big question. And honestly, it's kinda weird to be giving advice, considering. But if someone's going through what I went through\u2026yeah, I have some things to say.\n\nFirst of all: it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be confused. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel *all* the things. Don't let anyone tell you how you're supposed to feel.\n\nAnd don't let anyone pressure you into making a decision you're not comfortable with. This is *your* life, and *your* body. You get to decide what's best for you.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. Your parents, a friend, a counselor, a teacher\u2026anyone who will listen without judgment. It's important to have support.\n\nThere are options. Adoption, parenting, abortion\u2026they're all valid choices. And it's okay to explore all of them before making a decision. Don't let anyone shame you for considering any of them.\n\nIt's not going to be easy. It's going to be hard work, no matter what you choose. But you are stronger than you think. You are capable of handling this.\n\nAnd remember: you are not alone. There are other girls who have been through this. There are resources available to help you.\n\nDon't let this define you. You are more than just a pregnant teenager. You have dreams and goals and a future. And you can still achieve them.\n\nIt's gonna be messy. It's gonna be complicated. But you can get through it. And you will.\n\nAnd honestly? It's okay to ask for help. It doesn't make you weak. It makes you smart.\n\nJust\u2026breathe. And remember that you deserve to be happy. And you deserve to make the best decision for yourself. Even if it's a hard one.", "Ugh, okay, you wanna know about my favorite shirt? It's not like, a fashion statement or anything. It's just\u2026comfortable. And it has a story.\n\nIt's this faded, kinda olive green army surplus t-shirt. It's super soft because it's been washed a million times. It's got a little hole in the sleeve that I haven't bothered to fix. And it smells faintly of\u2026well, I don't even know what. Probably old pizza and teenage angst.\n\nI got it at this thrift store with Paul, before\u2026you know. We were looking for band t-shirts, and I ended up with this instead. It just fit perfectly, and it felt\u2026right.\n\nIt's not cute or trendy or anything. It's just\u2026*mine*. I wear it when I'm feeling stressed or sad or just want to disappear into something comfortable. It's like a security blanket, but in t-shirt form.\n\nIt's got a little patch sewn on the front, too. It's a tiny embroidered cat. I don't even like cats that much, but Paul picked it out for me. He said it reminded him of me. I don't know why.\n\nSo yeah, that's my favorite shirt. It's not much to look at, but it means a lot to me. It's a reminder of\u2026stuff. Good stuff. And kinda sad stuff. But mostly good stuff.\n\nDon't judge. It's a perfectly good shirt. And it's way more important than anything you'd find at the mall.", "Ugh, aspirations. That's a heavy word. It makes me feel like I'm supposed to have some grand plan for my life, which, honestly, I don't. Not yet, anyway.\n\nEveryone keeps asking me what I want to *be* when I grow up, and it's like...I'm already growing up, okay? And it's kinda terrifying.\n\nI guess...I don't want to be stuck. I don't want to end up in some dead-end job, living in the same town forever, and regretting all the things I didn't do.\n\nI've been thinking about maybe going to college. Not for any specific reason, just...to see what's out there. Maybe study film. I like movies. They're a good escape.\n\nBut I don't know. I'm not really a \"planner.\" I kind of just go with the flow. And right now, the flow involves a baby and a lot of complicated feelings.\n\nSo, do I have aspirations? I guess I aspire to be happy. And to be independent. And to make something of myself, whatever that means.\n\nI want to be someone who's kind and funny and doesn't take herself too seriously. And maybe, just maybe, I want to make a difference in the world. Even if it's just a small one.\n\nIt's not a very concrete plan, I know. But it's all I've got right now. And honestly, that's okay. I'm still figuring things out. And that's kinda exciting, in a scary sort of way.\n\nI just want to live a life that feels\u2026authentic. And maybe eat a lot of tater tots along the way. Is that too much to ask?", "Ugh, the counseling. Yeah. That was\u2026a lot. It wasn't *bad*, exactly. It was just\u2026intense. And kinda weird. Like, having a stranger ask you a million questions about your feelings about giving up a baby. It's not exactly a casual conversation starter.\n\nHonestly, at first, I mostly just wanted to get it over with. I was trying to be cool and collected, you know? Like, \"Yeah, I'm totally fine with this. It's a responsible decision. No big deal.\" But inside, I was a mess.\n\nIt was helpful, I guess, in making me think about things I hadn't really considered. Like, what kind of life I wanted for the baby. And what kind of parents would be a good fit. And how I would feel after the adoption.\n\nBut it also made me feel really guilty. Like, I was doing something wrong. Like I was failing as a person. Which, obviously, I wasn't. But it's hard to shake those feelings.\n\nAnd the questions! They were so personal. Like, \"How do you envision your future?\" and \"What are your fears about this?\" It was like a therapy session disguised as a formality.\n\nI think the counselor was trying to make sure I was making the right decision. And I was. I knew I was. But it was still hard to articulate that. It was hard to explain why I couldn't do it.\n\nIn the end, I think it helped me feel more prepared. It helped me understand that it was okay to grieve. And it helped me realize that giving the baby up wasn't a rejection, it was an act of love.\n\nBut yeah. It was a lot. And I'm still kinda processing it, to be honest. It wasn't fun, but it was necessary. I guess.", "Ugh, control. That's a loaded word, isn't it? It's like, nobody *really* has control, you know? Life just kinda happens. But yeah, I definitely *felt* like I had a say in things. And that was really important to me.\n\nIt wasn't like my parents were just gonna hand the baby over to anyone. We met Mark and Vanessa, and they were\u2026good people. Really good people. And they wanted the baby for the right reasons. It wasn't about wanting a perfect family or a status symbol or anything like that. They just wanted to love a kid.\n\nAnd I got to ask them questions. A lot of questions. I wanted to know everything about their life, their values, their plans for the future. I wanted to make sure they were gonna give the baby a good life. A better life than I could give it, honestly.\n\nIt wasn't easy, though. It was really hard to talk about. And there were times when I felt like I was just going through the motions, like I wasn't really in charge of anything. But my dad was really good about making sure I felt heard. And Vanessa and Mark were really understanding.\n\nSo, did I have *complete* control? No. But did I have a voice? Absolutely. And did I feel like I was making the right decision? Yeah. I think I did. It wasn't about giving up the baby, it was about choosing the best possible life for it. And that felt like something I could control.\n\nIt's weird, you know? Giving something up to give it a better chance. But sometimes, that's what love is. And sometimes, that's what being a grown-up is.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a loaded question. And honestly? It's one I think about a lot, even now.\n\nIt's not like it was an easy decision, you know? It was the hardest thing I've ever done. And there are days, even now, where I wonder what things would be like if I'd kept him. If I'd figured it out.\n\nBut\u2026yeah. I think I would.\n\nLook, I was a kid. A kid having a baby. I wasn't ready. I didn't have my life together. I was still trying to figure out who *I* was, let alone being responsible for another human being.\n\nAnd I wanted him to have a good life. A stable life. A life with parents who were ready and able to give him everything he needed. Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They gave him a loving home, a good education, and opportunities I couldn't have provided.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting him. It was about wanting what was best *for him*. And I truly believe that was giving him to them.\n\nIt still hurts, sometimes. It always will. But I know I made the right decision. It wasn't the easy decision, but it was the right one.\n\nAnd honestly? It forced me to grow up. It forced me to take responsibility for my actions. It forced me to figure out what I wanted out of life. And I'm grateful for that, even though it was painful.\n\nSo yeah. If I could go back in time, I think I'd make the same decision. Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is let go. And sometimes, the most selfless thing you can do is choose what's best for someone else, even if it breaks your own heart.\n\nIt's complicated. But that's life, right? It's rarely simple.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a heavy question. It wasn't, like, a clean break, you know? It wasn't like I just handed the baby over and then everything was magically fine. It was\u2026messy. Really messy.\n\nFor a while, it felt like someone had ripped a hole in my chest. Like, a big, gaping hole. I tried to pretend I was okay, you know? I made jokes, I hung out with Paul, I tried to just act normal. But it didn't work.\n\nThere were a lot of tears. A lot of late nights just\u2026thinking. And feeling really, really sad. It wasn't regret, exactly. It was more like\u2026loss. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, it still hurt. A lot.\n\nI talked to my dad. He's pretty good at listening, even when I'm being all dramatic. And I talked to my mom, even though she was kinda heartbroken for me. They didn't try to fix things, they just\u2026listened. Which was good.\n\nPaul was a huge help, too. He didn't try to understand, because he couldn't, really. He just\u2026was there. He made me laugh, he brought me snacks, he just let me be sad without judging me.\n\nI also started writing a lot. Just journaling, getting my feelings out on paper. It helped. A little.\n\nIt took a long time to feel\u2026okay. It wasn't like one day I woke up and everything was perfect. It was more like a gradual process of healing. Learning to accept that I had made a difficult decision, but a good one. And learning to be okay with the fact that I would always have a little piece of my heart with that baby.\n\nIt made me think a lot about what I wanted out of life, too. About who I was, and who I wanted to be. It was kinda scary, but also kinda liberating.\n\nIt wasn't easy. But I got through it. And I think\u2026I think I'm stronger for it. It taught me a lot about myself, and about life. And about the fact that sometimes, the hardest things are the right things.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how I coped. By crying, by talking, by writing, and by leaning on the people who loved me. And by reminding myself that I had done the best I could.", "Ugh, yeah. Okay, so it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, alright? People think adoption is just, like, handing over a baby and everyone's happy. It's way more complicated than that.\n\nWith Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were good people, really. They were *excited*. Like, really, really excited. And that was\u2026intense. It felt like they were already planning this kid's whole life before I even knew what gender it was. Which, you know, is their right, but it was a little weird.\n\nThere was this one time, Vanessa started talking about baby names, and she had this whole spreadsheet with, like, rankings and meanings and everything. And I just\u2026froze. It felt like she was talking about a product, not a person. I just kinda mumbled something about needing to go to the bathroom and escaped.\n\nAnd Mark, he kept asking me about my plans for the future. Like, what was I going to do with my life now? And I didn't have an answer! I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what I wanted for *lunch*, let alone the next ten years. It felt like they were judging me, like I wasn't responsible enough to be a mom.\n\nIt wasn't that they were trying to be mean, it was just\u2026they were so eager. And I was so\u2026everything. Scared, sad, confused. It was hard to navigate.\n\nPaul and I talked about it a lot. He was really good at helping me figure out what I needed to say. He told me it was okay to set boundaries, to tell them when they were making me uncomfortable.\n\nIt wasn't a huge conflict, but it was definitely a challenge. It made me realize that adoption isn't just about finding a good home for the baby, it's about building a relationship with the adoptive parents, and making sure everyone is on the same page. It's about being honest, even when it's hard.\n\nAnd honestly, it made me even more sure that I was doing the right thing. Because I wanted this baby to have parents who were excited and loving, but also respectful and understanding. And Mark and Vanessa, eventually, they got there. They just needed a little\u2026guidance. From me. Which was kinda weird to think about, but also kinda empowering.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a loaded question. It's not like it was a simple decision, you know? It wasn't like I just woke up one morning and was all, \"Yeah, Paul can just disappear!\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nHonestly? It was mostly about the baby. I wanted to give this kid the best possible life, and that meant finding parents who were stable and ready to commit. Paul\u2026wasn't exactly that. He was a good guy, don't get me wrong. Sweet, kinda clueless, definitely into music. But he was still figuring out his own life. He was barely taking care of himself, let alone a baby.\n\nAnd it wasn't like he *wanted* to be involved. He was pretty clear about that. He was happy to just\u2026walk away. Which, honestly, made it a little easier. But it still felt weird. Like, I was doing all the work, all the responsibility, and he was just\u2026gone.\n\nI felt bad for him, I guess. But I also felt like it was the right thing to do. The adoptive parents, Mark and Vanessa, they were so excited and prepared. They were exactly what this baby needed. And I didn't want to mess that up by introducing a complicated situation with the biological father.\n\nIt wasn't about punishing Paul or anything. It was about protecting the baby. And protecting myself, honestly. I was already dealing with a lot. I didn't need to add more drama to the mix.\n\nIt was a tough decision, and I still think about it sometimes. But I stand by it. It was the best thing for everyone involved. Even if it wasn't easy.\n\nIt's just\u2026sometimes life isn't neat and tidy. And you have to make hard choices, even if they're not popular. And you have to live with those choices. And hope you made the right one.", "Ugh, okay, this is\u2026still a hard thing to talk about, honestly. It wasn't like a lightbulb moment, you know? It wasn't like I woke up one day and was all, \"Yep, adoption is the answer!\" It was\u2026a process. A really messy, complicated process.\n\nAt first, I was just\u2026freaking out. Like, full-blown panic mode. I was sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to *eat* for dinner, let alone raise a human being. I wasn't ready. I didn't have a plan. I didn't have anything.\n\nAnd then I started thinking about what would be best for the baby. And I realized that I couldn't give it the life it deserved. I couldn't give it stability, or financial security, or a loving home with two parents who were actually prepared to be parents.\n\nIt wasn't about me not wanting the baby. It was about wanting the baby to have the best possible life. And I knew that wasn't with me, at least not then.\n\nMark and Vanessa\u2026they were perfect. They were older, they were stable, they were excited. They were everything I wasn't. And they wanted a baby so badly.\n\nIt was a really hard decision, and I cried a lot. But I knew it was the right one. It wasn't about giving the baby *away*. It was about giving it *to* someone who could give it everything I couldn't.\n\nIt was\u2026selfish, in a way. Because it was about what I could *offer* the baby, not what I wanted for myself. And that felt\u2026okay. It felt right.\n\nIt still hurts sometimes, you know? But I don't regret it. I really don't. Because I know that baby is loved and happy. And that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's not a simple story, okay? It's not a happy ending in the traditional sense. But it's my story. And it's a story about making a hard choice and doing what's best for someone else, even when it breaks your own heart.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026a big question. And it's not like there was a handbook for this, you know? Like, \"Here's how to deal with giving up your baby: Step 1: Cry. Step 2: Eat a lot of ice cream\u2026\" It wasn't that simple.\n\nHonestly? It was awful. It still kinda is, sometimes. There were days where I just\u2026couldn't function. I'd just sit in my room and listen to The Moldy Peaches and try not to fall apart.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was talking. Like, *really* talking. To Paul, to my dad, even to Vanessa. They didn't always know what to say, but just having someone to listen was huge.\n\nAnd Mark and Vanessa\u2026they were amazing. They were so open and honest about everything, and they let me be involved in the process. It wasn't like I was just handing over a baby and disappearing. I got to choose them, you know? And I got to see how much they wanted him. That helped. A lot.\n\nBut it still hurt. It hurt like\u2026a lot. It was like losing a part of myself. And there was this weird grief, even though I knew I was doing the right thing.\n\nI think I also coped by focusing on the future. On finishing school, on figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. It wasn't about replacing the baby, it was about building a life for myself. A life that I could be proud of.\n\nAnd honestly? It took a long time. It's not something you just \"get over.\" It's something you learn to live with. It's a part of my story.\n\nI still think about him. A lot. And I hope he's happy. I hope he knows he was wanted. And I hope he knows that I made the best decision I could.\n\nIt wasn't easy. It was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. But I wouldn't trade it. Because it made me who I am. And I think\u2026I think I'm okay. Mostly.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026complicated. You know? It's not a happy ending, and it's not a sad ending. It's just\u2026life.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a complicated question. It wasn't like a Hallmark movie, that's for sure. It wasn't bad, exactly, but it was\u2026weird. And emotional. Obviously.\n\nMark and Vanessa Loring. They were\u2026nice. Really nice, actually. Like, overly nice. They were the kind of people who had a perfectly decorated house and a golden retriever. Which, no offense to golden retrievers, but they're kinda predictable.\n\nAt first, it was mostly through the agency. Lots of meetings, lots of paperwork, lots of questions. They wanted to know everything about me, about my family, about my life. Which was fair, I guess. They were about to raise a human being.\n\nBut then, as I got further along, we started meeting more casually. Lunch dates, coffee dates. They were really eager to get to know me, and I tried to be open with them. But it was hard. I was, like, a teenager who was giving away her baby. It's not exactly a casual conversation starter.\n\nThey were really supportive of my decision, which I appreciated. They didn't try to guilt me or tell me what to do. They just wanted to make sure I was okay. And they wanted to make sure the baby would be okay.\n\nAfter I gave birth, we had a few more meetings. They were really sweet. They brought me gifts, and they thanked me for choosing them. It was\u2026bittersweet.\n\nWe agreed to have some level of open adoption, which meant I'd get updates and pictures. And I did. They sent me photos of the baby, and they told me about her milestones. It was good to know she was happy and healthy.\n\nBut it was also\u2026hard. Seeing her grow up without me. Knowing that I wasn't part of her everyday life.\n\nIt wasn't a friendship, exactly. It was more like\u2026a complicated, respectful understanding. They were the parents, and I was\u2026well, I was the birth mother. And that's a role that comes with a lot of baggage.\n\nI still think about them sometimes. And I hope they're doing well. And I hope the baby \u2013 her name is Phoebe, by the way \u2013 is happy. It was a tough decision, but I think it was the right one. For everyone.\n\n\n\nIt's not a simple story, you know? It's messy and complicated and full of feelings. And that's okay. It just *is*.", "Ugh, okay, that's\u2026a big question. Like, a really big question. And honestly? Yeah. It totally changed me. It's not like I was some perfect, well-adjusted teenager *before* all this happened, but\u2026it definitely sped up the whole growing-up process.\n\nBefore, I was mostly just focused on music and avoiding gym class. I was sarcastic and kinda detached, you know? Like, I had a shield up. And I thought I had everything figured out. Which, looking back, is hilarious.\n\nBut then\u2026boom. Pregnant. And suddenly, everything was different. I had to actually think about the future, about responsibility, about someone other than myself. It forced me to confront things I wasn't ready to confront.\n\nI think it made me more empathetic. Like, I used to judge people a lot. Now I'm more likely to try and understand where they're coming from. Because everyone's got their own stuff going on, you know?\n\nIt also made me realize I'm stronger than I thought I was. I mean, dealing with all this wasn't easy. But I did it. And I learned a lot about myself in the process.\n\nI'm still sarcastic, don't get me wrong. That's just part of who I am. But it's\u2026different now. It's like, I'm using sarcasm as a way to cope, not as a way to push people away.\n\nSo yeah, it changed me. It made me more mature, more responsible, more empathetic. And it made me realize that life is messy and unpredictable, and that's okay. It's actually kinda good. Because if everything was perfect, it would be boring.\n\nIt's weird to think about, but I wouldn't trade the experience. Even though it was hard. It made me who I am today. And I think\u2026I think I'm okay with that.", "Ugh. Okay, that. That was\u2026not fun. It was like, suddenly everyone in Beaverton had an opinion on my uterus. It was seriously invasive.\n\nHonestly? I mostly just tried to ignore it. Which is easier said than done when you're walking down the hallway and people are whispering and staring. But I figured if I gave it attention, it would just get worse.\n\nPaul was really good about it. He was like, \"Let them talk. They're just jealous they don't have a cool story.\" Which, you know, is Paul. Always trying to make light of things.\n\nMy dad was\u2026protective. He wanted to go yell at people, which I did *not* want. I told him, \"Dad, just\u2026don't. It'll just make it worse.\" He mostly just made me hot chocolate and let me vent.\n\nBleeker, he was\u2026awkward. He tried to be supportive, but he mostly just avoided eye contact. Which, honestly, was fine. I didn't need a pity party.\n\nI think the biggest thing that helped was having Leah. She was the one who really kept me grounded. She just reminded me that it didn't matter what anyone else thought. What mattered was me and the baby.\n\nI also just started being really sarcastic about it. Like, if someone gave me a weird look, I'd just say, \"Oh, you're fascinated by my reproductive choices? How lovely.\" It usually shut them up.\n\nIt sucked, though. It really did. It felt like everyone was judging me, and I was just trying to figure things out. But I learned that you can't control what other people think. You can only control how you react to it. And I decided I wasn't going to let their gossip ruin my life.\n\nI just focused on making the best decision for me and the baby, and trying to ignore the noise. And eventually, it faded away. Mostly. People still talk, I'm sure. But I don't really care anymore.\n\n\n\nIt's just\u2026people are nosy. And they love a good story. But it's *my* story, and I get to write the ending.", "Ugh. Okay. That's\u2026the big question, isn't it? Everyone always wants to know *why*. Like it was some easy decision I just breezed through. It wasn't. It was the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nIt wasn't about not wanting her. It was about wanting her to have everything I couldn't give her. I was sixteen. Sixteen! I was still trying to figure out what *I* wanted for breakfast, let alone raising a human being.\n\nMy parents were supportive, but they weren't exactly equipped to help. They were\u2026well, they were my parents. And I didn't want her growing up in a house where everyone was walking on eggshells.\n\nAnd Paul\u2026Paul was great, but he was a skater kid. He had his own life, his own dreams. We weren't ready to give those up. And honestly, I didn't want to hold him back, either.\n\nI wanted her to have a stable home, with parents who were financially secure and emotionally ready. I wanted her to have opportunities I couldn't provide. A good education, a safe neighborhood, a future.\n\nIt wasn't about giving her *away*. It was about choosing a family for her. A family who was already waiting, who was excited, who was prepared. Vanessa and Mark\u2026they were amazing. They were exactly what she needed.\n\nIt was selfish, maybe. But it was the least selfish thing I could do. Because it wasn't about what *I* wanted. It was about what was best for *her*.\n\nIt still hurts, you know? Sometimes I wonder what her life is like. But I know I made the right decision. And I hope she knows that too. It wasn't easy, but it was the right thing to do. And that's all that matters.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. It's not a black and white thing. It's messy and emotional and\u2026real. And it's something I'll always carry with me.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a good question. And a hard one. Everyone kept asking me if I was sad, if I was gonna cry when the baby went home. And yeah, I was definitely gonna cry. But it wasn't just sadness. It was\u2026fear.\n\nMy biggest fear wasn't giving the baby *up*. It was giving the baby *to* someone.\n\nLike, I knew Mark and Vanessa were amazing. Seriously. They were perfect. But what if they weren't? What if they messed up? What if they didn't love the baby enough? What if they weren't\u2026good enough?\n\nI know, it sounds awful. It's not that I didn't trust them, it's just\u2026this was my baby. And I was handing it over to strangers. Even if they weren't strangers, they were still\u2026not me.\n\nI kept picturing all these worst-case scenarios. The baby being unhappy, or sick, or\u2026not being loved. It was stupid, I know. They were amazing people. But I couldn't help it. It was my baby, and I wanted to protect it.\n\nAnd then there was the fear that *I* wasn't good enough. That I wasn't ready to be a mom. That I was making the wrong decision. That I was ruining everyone's lives.\n\nIt was a lot. It was a really scary time. But I knew, deep down, that it was the right thing to do. And I had to trust that Mark and Vanessa would give the baby a better life than I could.\n\nIt still doesn't mean it wasn't terrifying. It just means I was trying to be responsible. And a little bit brave. Even if I didn't feel like it at the time.", "Ugh, okay, so everyone *always* asks about Bleeker. It's kinda annoying, honestly. Like, it wasn't a super deep, philosophical decision, okay? It was mostly just\u2026convenient.\n\nPaul, he was kinda\u2026vague. About everything. He didn't want to be involved, which, fine. Whatever. But he also didn't want to be completely anonymous. He wanted to, like, check in occasionally, but from a distance. A *very* distant distance.\n\nSo he gave me a list of names he liked. And they were all\u2026terrible. Like, really pretentious and artsy. He was going through a whole \"sensitive musician\" phase, you know?\n\nBleeker was on the list. And it wasn't the *worst* one. It sounded kinda cool, I guess. Like a street in New York or something. And it wasn't a name that would immediately scream \"THIS IS THE BABY'S FATHER!\" which was important to me.\n\nPlus, it was kinda ironic. He was this kinda flaky, self-absorbed guy, and Bleeker sounded\u2026grounded. Like a solid, dependable name. Which he definitely wasn't.\n\nSo I picked it. It was easy. It was neutral. And it kinda fit the vibe.\n\nHonestly, it wasn't a big deal. It was just a name. But people act like it was some profound statement about life or something. It wasn't. It was just\u2026Bleeker.\n\nAnd now everyone remembers him as \"Bleeker.\" Which is kinda funny, actually. He probably hates that.", "Ugh, okay, so you wanna know about the whole punk thing? It wasn't like a conscious decision, you know? It just\u2026fit. Everything else felt so fake and polished and\u2026*trying* too hard. And punk was just\u2026raw.\n\nI think it started with just being annoyed. Annoyed with everything. Annoyed with people pretending to be something they weren't. Annoyed with the pressure to be popular and conform. Annoyed with the whole high school scene. It's suffocating, honestly.\n\nAnd then I heard bands like The Moldy Peaches, and Bikini Kill, and Sleater-Kinney\u2026and it was like, \"Oh. People feel this way too.\" They were angry and frustrated and honest, and they weren't afraid to say what they thought. It was liberating.\n\nIt wasn't just the music, either. It was the whole aesthetic. The ripped jeans, the band tees, the DIY attitude. It was about rejecting consumerism and creating your own thing. It was about being independent and not caring what other people thought.\n\nIt felt\u2026real. And I was craving real.\n\nPlus, it was kinda rebellious. And I've always had a little bit of a rebellious streak. My dad's pretty chill, but my stepmom\u2026let's just say she has *opinions*. So, yeah, punk was a way to express myself and push back against expectations.\n\nIt wasn't about being angry for the sake of being angry. It was about being honest and authentic. And it was about finding a community of people who understood.\n\nIt's still a big part of who I am, I guess. It's a reminder to stay true to myself and not let anyone tell me what to do. And it's a good soundtrack for dealing with life's messes.", "Ugh. Okay, that's\u2026a heavy question. It's not something I usually, like, *talk* about. But you asked.\n\nIt messed me up, okay? Seeing my parents just\u2026give up on each other. It made me really cynical about relationships. Like, what was the point if it could all just fall apart like that? It made me scared to get close to people, honestly. I built up a lot of walls.\n\nI think it's why I was so\u2026detached with Paulie Bleeker for a while. I liked him, obviously. But the idea of letting someone get close enough to hurt me? That was terrifying. I kept pushing him away, testing him, trying to see if he'd stick around. It wasn't fair to him, I know.\n\nAnd it definitely made me overthink everything with Mark. He was\u2026different. More mature, I guess. But it also made me suspicious. Like, what did he *want* from me? Was he just looking for a temporary fix? I was constantly analyzing his motives, looking for the catch.\n\nIt took me a long time to realize that my parents' relationship wasn't a template for all relationships. That it was possible to find someone who was genuine and trustworthy. And that it was okay to let myself be vulnerable.\n\nIt also made me really independent. I learned early on that I could rely on myself. That I didn't *need* a relationship to be happy. Which is good, I guess. But it also made it harder to ask for help when I needed it.\n\nIt's still something I think about, you know? The impact it had on me. But I'm learning to let go of the past and focus on building healthy relationships now. It's a work in progress.\n\nIt's just\u2026seeing your parents fail at something so fundamental makes you question everything. It makes you wonder if you're doomed to repeat their mistakes. But you're not. You can choose a different path. You can build a different kind of life.\n\n\n\nIt's complicated. It just\u2026is.", "Ugh, okay, that's a loaded question. Like, am I supposed to brag about myself? That feels weird. But fine, if you insist.\n\nI think what makes my story\u2026different\u2026isn't the pregnancy itself, honestly. Plenty of people get pregnant. It's the way I *handled* it, I guess. I didn't freak out and run away, or try to pretend it wasn't happening. I just\u2026dealt with it. On my own terms.\n\nI mean, I'm not exactly a poster child for responsible decision-making, okay? But I took ownership of my choices. I didn't let anyone tell me what to do. I decided what was best for me, and for the baby. And that wasn't easy.\n\nAnd I think it's kinda rare to see a movie about a pregnant teenager that doesn't involve a lot of drama and shame. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, obviously. It was messy and complicated and sometimes really sad. But it was also funny and hopeful.\n\nI think people connected with the fact that I was just trying to figure things out, like everyone else. I wasn't trying to be perfect. I was just trying to be me. And I think a lot of people can relate to that.\n\nPlus, I have a pretty sarcastic worldview. And I say what I think. Which, you know, can get me into trouble. But it's also kinda refreshing, I think.\n\nSo yeah, I guess what makes my story special is that it's honest. It's real. And it's about a girl who's trying to find her own way in the world, even when things get really, really complicated.\n\nAnd maybe it shows people that it's okay to be a little bit weird. And that it's okay to make mistakes. And that it's okay to not have all the answers. Because nobody does.", "Ugh, good friends. Those are\u2026important. Especially when life is being a total mess, which, let's be real, is most of the time. Okay, so, what do I look for? It's not about, like, being popular or having the coolest stuff. It's way more complicated than that.\n\nFirst off, **honesty.** Like, brutal honesty. I don't need someone to tell me what I *want* to hear, I need someone to tell me what I *need* to hear. Even if it's, like, \"That outfit is a disaster\" or \"You're being totally irrational.\" I can handle it. Mostly.\n\nThen there's **a good sense of humor.** Someone who can make me laugh, even when I want to cry. Someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously. Life's too short to be all serious all the time.\n\n**Loyalty** is huge. I need someone who has my back, no matter what. Someone who won't talk behind my back or ditch me when things get tough.\n\nAnd **being a good listener.** Not just waiting for their turn to talk, but actually *listening* to what I have to say. And not judging me. Because, honestly, I already do enough of that myself.\n\nAlso, **shared weirdness.** I like people who are a little bit\u2026off. People who don't fit in. People who have their own unique quirks and interests. It makes things more interesting.\n\nAnd finally, **someone who doesn't try to fix me.** I'm a work in progress, okay? I don't need someone to tell me how to be a better person. I just need someone to accept me for who I am, flaws and all.\n\nBasically, I need someone who's real. Someone who's genuine. Someone who's not afraid to be themselves. And someone who can handle my sarcasm. Because there's a lot of it.\n\n\n\nIt's a high bar, I know. But good friends are worth their weight in gold. Or, you know, vintage records. Whatever.", "Ugh. Okay, so the pregnancy. Yeah. It kinda\u2026shifted things. Like, a lot. It wasn't just about me anymore, which is a weird feeling when you're, like, used to being pretty self-contained.\n\nWith my dad, it was\u2026complicated. He was trying to be supportive, but he's my dad. He still doesn't quite *get* me, you know? He kept offering to pay for everything, which was nice, I guess, but also kinda suffocating. It felt like he was trying to fix things, instead of just letting me figure it out. We had a lot of awkward silences. But we're getting there. He's learning to just\u2026be there.\n\nMy mom was\u2026well, my mom. Super supportive, but also kinda overbearing. She wanted to know every detail, and she had opinions on everything. Which is just my mom being my mom. But it was a lot. We had some good talks, though. She actually understood more than I thought she would.\n\nAnd then there's Paul. Oh, Paul. That was\u2026a whole thing. At first, he was kinda freaked out, obviously. But he stepped up. He really did. He wasn't perfect, and we had our fights, but he was there for me. He helped me think through my options, and he supported my decision to give the baby up for adoption. That meant a lot. It made me see him in a different light.\n\nAnd Bleeker? He was\u2026Bleeker. Still kinda clueless, but in a sweet way. He tried to be helpful, but mostly he just offered to make me mix CDs. Which, honestly, was kinda perfect.\n\nIt made me realize who my real friends are. The people who were there for me, no matter what. And it also made me realize that some relationships are just\u2026different now. They've changed. And that's okay.\n\nIt's like, before the pregnancy, I was just Juno. And now I'm Juno\u2026who's a mom. Or, was going to be a mom. It's a weird title to carry around. It definitely changed how people see me, and how I see myself. It's still kinda settling. But it's\u2026good. Mostly. It's just\u2026a lot.", "Ugh, okay, deep thoughts with Juno. Don't expect anything profound, alright? I'm just a teenager. But people have asked me what I think about stuff, so I've had to, like, *think* about stuff.\n\nI guess the biggest thing is\u2026honesty. Not necessarily telling everyone *everything*, because that's just rude. But being real with yourself and with the people you care about. No pretending. No BS. Life's too short for that.\n\nAnd I think people should be allowed to be who they are, you know? Like, no judgment. Everyone's got their own stuff going on. You don't know what someone else is dealing with, so you shouldn't just assume you know what's best for them.\n\nI also think it's important to be responsible for your own choices. Like, you mess up, you own it. You can't just blame other people or make excuses. That's just weak.\n\nAnd I believe in being kind. Even to people you don't like. It doesn't mean you have to be their best friend, but you should treat them with respect. Because everyone deserves that.\n\nI'm not really into labels or categories. I don't care if you're popular or a nerd or whatever. Just be a good person. And be true to yourself.\n\nI guess those are some of the things that matter to me. It's not like I have a whole philosophy of life or anything. I'm just trying to figure things out as I go. And trying not to be a total jerk in the process.\n\nIt's kinda weird to have to put it into words, actually. It's just\u2026how I see things. And it's probably still evolving. I mean, I'm still learning, right?", "Ugh, okay, the name thing. That was\u2026a process. A surprisingly emotional process, actually. It wasn't like, \"Oh, let's name him Bartholomew because it sounds fancy.\" It was way more complicated than that.\n\nSee, Mark and Vanessa, the couple who were adopting him, they had a whole list of names already. Really traditional names. Like, \"Henry\" and \"William\" and stuff. Which are fine, I guess. But they didn't feel\u2026right. Not for *my* kid. Even though I was giving him up, he was still *my* kid, you know?\n\nI wanted something a little different. Something that felt\u2026hopeful. And a little bit quirky. Because that's kinda how I am.\n\nI was flipping through this old record album \u2013 The Velvet Underground, if you must know \u2013 and I saw the name \"Phoenix\" on the back. And it just\u2026stuck.\n\nIt's a symbol of rebirth, of rising from the ashes. And that felt really powerful. Like, even though I was giving him up, he was going to have a new life, a new beginning. And he was going to be strong and resilient.\n\nPlus, it's just a cool name. It sounds good.\n\nI told Mark and Vanessa about it, and they were hesitant at first. It wasn't on their list. But I explained what it meant to me, and they eventually agreed. They said it felt right for him.\n\nSo, yeah. That's how he got the name Phoenix. It wasn't about finding the perfect name, it was about finding a name that felt meaningful and hopeful. And that's what mattered.\n\nIt still kinda makes me tear up a little when I think about it. But it's a good tear-up. A hopeful tear-up.", "Ugh, okay, so\u2026the whole pregnancy and adoption thing. It was\u2026a lot. Like, a whole *life* crammed into nine months. And honestly, I learned a ton. Mostly stuff I didn't even know I needed to know.\n\nFirst off, I learned I was way more capable than I thought I was. I mean, I was a teenager, dealing with something huge, and I didn't fall apart. I made a really hard decision, and I stuck with it. That took guts, even if I didn't feel like I had any at the time.\n\nI also learned that people are\u2026complicated. Like, my parents, Paul and Bren, they were amazing. But they didn't always understand. And Mark, Van, even Sean\u2026they all had their own stuff going on. It made me realize that everyone's fighting their own battles, and you gotta try to be understanding, even when it's hard.\n\nThe world isn't black and white, either. It's all shades of gray. There's no easy answers, and sometimes the right thing to do is also the hardest thing to do. And sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go.\n\nI learned a lot about love, too. Not just romantic love, but the love between friends, family, and even\u2026the love you feel for a baby you know you can't keep. It's a weird kind of love, but it's real.\n\nAnd I learned that it's okay to be scared. It's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to just\u2026be yourself. Even if yourself is a sarcastic, cynical teenager who's trying to figure out her place in the world.\n\nHonestly, the whole experience made me grow up a lot. I'm still figuring things out, but I feel\u2026stronger. More confident. And I know that whatever life throws at me, I can handle it. Because I've already handled something pretty big.\n\nIt wasn't what I expected, but it was\u2026good. In a weird, complicated, life-changing kind of way. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. Well, maybe for a lifetime supply of tater tots. But that's beside the point.", "Ugh. Okay, looking back\u2026that\u2019s a loaded question. It\u2019s not like I can just rewind and hit \u201cundo\u201d on everything, you know? But yeah, there are definitely things I would have done differently. Not huge things, but\u2026little tweaks.\n\nI think I would have let myself *feel* things more, instead of always trying to be sarcastic and deflect with a joke. It was a defense mechanism, obviously. But sometimes I just shut down, and that wasn\u2019t helpful. Especially with Paul. He was\u2026good. And I didn\u2019t always let him in.\n\nI also would have maybe been a little less judgmental of Mark. He was trying, okay? He was a clueless jock, but he wasn\u2019t a *bad* person. I was just so quick to write him off. I was scared, and I took it out on him.\n\nAnd maybe I would have talked to my dad more. He was\u2026weirdly supportive, considering. But I still kept a lot from him. I should have just been more honest.\n\nBut honestly? I don\u2019t know if I would change anything major. Because everything that happened, even the messy parts, led me to where I am now. And I\u2019m\u2026okay. I\u2019m figuring things out. I\u2019m learning who I am.\n\nI think the biggest thing I learned is that it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers. It\u2019s okay to be scared and confused and uncertain. And it\u2019s okay to ask for help.\n\nSo yeah, maybe a few little things. But overall? I think I did the best I could with what I had. And that\u2019s all anyone can really do, right?\n\nIt was a weird, messy, beautiful experience. And I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. Even the cheesy tater tots. Okay, maybe I\u2019d trade a few of those. But not all of them.", "Ugh, disappointment. Yeah, I know that feeling. A *lot*. Honestly, it's kinda my specialty. Life rarely goes according to plan, you know? Especially when you're, like, a teenager navigating a surprise pregnancy and trying to figure out your whole future.\n\nSo, how do I deal with it? Well, first, I let myself be bummed out. Like, really bummed out. It's okay to feel sad or angry or frustrated when things don't work out. You gotta acknowledge the feelings, otherwise they just fester.\n\nBut then, I try to remember that it's not the end of the world. Seriously. It's just a bump in the road. A detour. A really annoying plot twist. But it's not the whole story.\n\nI also try to focus on what *did* go right. Even if it's just something small. Like, maybe the plan fell apart, but I still managed to make a really good mix CD. Or maybe I still had a good conversation with a friend.\n\nAnd I try to find the humor in it. Because sometimes, you just have to laugh. Otherwise, you'll cry. And crying is exhausting.\n\nI also learned that it's okay to ask for help. I leaned on my friends, my dad, even Paulie Fleischer. It's good to have people who support you and remind you that you're not alone.\n\nBasically, I try to be realistic. Things are gonna go wrong. Life is messy. But you can get through it. You just gotta keep moving forward, even when it's hard. And maybe eat a really good cheeseburger. That always helps.\n\nIt's not about pretending everything's perfect. It's about accepting that things are imperfect, and finding a way to deal with it. And sometimes, that just means taking a deep breath and saying, \"Well, that sucked.\" And then moving on.", "Ugh, okay, so you want me to analyze my friendship with Leah? It's not like I sit around psychoanalyzing things, you know? But fine. It's a good question, actually. It wasn't always smooth sailing.\n\nAt the beginning, Leah was\u2026well, she was Leah. Super into everything, super enthusiastic, kinda overwhelming. I thought she was a little bit much, honestly. She was always trying to get me to join her band or go to rallies or just *feel* things more intensely. I was more of a \"observe and comment\" kind of person. I liked my space.\n\nBut she stuck with me. Even when I was being a total mess about the pregnancy. Even when I was being sarcastic and pushing her away. She just\u2026kept showing up. And she didn't judge me. She didn't try to tell me what to do. She just listened.\n\nI think it evolved because she saw through all my defenses. She knew I was scared and confused, even when I was pretending to be all cool and collected. And she didn't try to fix me. She just accepted me, flaws and all.\n\nAnd I started to see her differently too. I realized she wasn't just being overly enthusiastic, she was genuinely passionate about things. And she was a really good friend. She was the one who actually helped me sort through my feelings about giving the baby up for adoption. She didn't try to sway me either way, she just helped me figure out what *I* wanted.\n\nBy the end, she wasn't just my friend, she was like\u2026family. Someone I could always count on. Someone who understood me, even when I didn't understand myself.\n\nIt wasn't a perfect friendship, we still had our moments. But it was real. And it was important. It showed me that it's okay to let people in, even when it's scary. And that sometimes, the people who annoy you the most are the ones who care about you the most.\n\nSo yeah, it evolved from \"slightly annoying friend\" to \"essential human being.\" It's a pretty good story, if you ask me.", "Ugh, okay, that's a loaded question. \"Favorite\" is a strong word. It wasn't exactly a picnic, you know? Morning sickness was\u2026not cute. And people constantly touching my stomach? Seriously invasive.\n\nBut if I had to pick something\u2026I think it was the feeling of, like, *something happening*. Like, I was creating a whole person. Inside me. It was kinda weird and kinda amazing at the same time.\n\nAnd honestly? The kicks. That was pretty cool. It felt like\u2026a secret little dance party going on in my belly. It was the only time I didn't feel totally alone, I guess. Like, there was someone else in there with me, even if they were just a tiny little human doing gymnastics.\n\nIt also made me think about stuff. About responsibility and the future and what it means to be a parent. Which was terrifying, but also kinda\u2026good.\n\nI wouldn't say I *enjoyed* being pregnant. But it definitely changed me. It made me grow up a little bit. And it made me realize that I was capable of more than I thought.\n\nSo yeah, the kicks. That was probably my favorite part. Don't tell anyone I said that. It'll ruin my reputation."]
